He kept saying it for the next 90-plus minutes.\n\nTrump is on a mission to “revive the righteous cause of American liberty,” jumpstart a new age of “American marvels” and plant the Stars and Stripes on Mars.\n\nTo infinity and beyond: Trump’s feel-good buzz is light-years away from the slurs and stumbles of the hoarse whisperer Joe Biden, let alone the halfwit hectoring and contrived cackling of Kamala Harris.\n\nFor in some dismal parallel universe, it was President Harris, not President Trump, who was at the podium on Tuesday night.\n\nBut the real stars of the speech were in the balcony.\n\nThe mother and sister of Laken Riley, a nursing student who went out for a jog one morning and was murdered by an illegal immigrant.\n\nThe wife and daughters of Corey Comperatore, the firefighter who died shielding them from the gunman’s bullets at Trump’s rally in Butler, Penn.\n\nElliston Berry, a 15-year-old girl victimized by “deep fake” cyberbullying at school.\n\nStephanie Diller, whose police officer husband Jonathan was murdered at a traffic stop in Queens by a repeat offender.\n\n“The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must,” Thucydides wrote. \n\nThe Democrats did whatever they wanted.\n\nThe suffering fell not only on the weakest, on women and children. \n\nIt also fell on the strong, like Jonathan Diller.\n\nLike Roberto Ortiz, the Navy veteran who gets shot at by the cartels when he is on Border Patrol duty on the Rio Grande.\n\nThe Democrats have taken liberties with the trust of the American people. \n\nTrump wants to restore the social contract.\n\nThe Democrats are so out of touch that they still cannot understand why Trump would do it. \n\nThe answer, like most things about him, is very simple and also pretty complex.\n\nTrump is a patriot. He loves his country. He wants Americans to be happy.\n\nThese are simple notions, far too simple for college professors and CNN pundits to comprehend. \n\nBut they run deep.\n\nAt heart, patriotism is a passion, the kind of irrationality that bureaucrats fear and dictators covet.\n\nThe Democrats suppressed, censored and stigmatized this natural passion.\n\nTrump understands that a nation is a big family.\n\nWe rise or fall together.\n\nNo wonder that within three weeks of his inauguration, Rasmussen’s pollsters reported that for the first time in 20 years, a plurality of Americans believe the country is “on the right track.”\n\nThat measure is the only one that matters. \n\nIt’s not about party loyalty, whatever the parties claim. \n\nIt’s about the fate of the nation.\n\nAs George Orwell said, “My country, right or left.”\n\nA government is a bureaucratic machine. A “society” is a sociological abstraction.\n\nFireworks and fly-bys are fun, but they are just symbols. \n\nA nation is made of people.\n\nThe American nation is a third of a billion individuals, all out for themselves but also — and more importantly — all in this together.\n\nWe should not be ashamed of these simple and important truths. \n\nThey are the wisdom of the ages.\n\nThey are the founding truths of constitutions and nations. \n\nThey connect the core of our affiliations, family and faith, to the wider circles of duty and responsibility that bind a nation.\n\nTo see what happens when government overrides these realities with ideology, look at the disaster that is England.\n\nMass immigration and political correctness have destroyed the compact between the rulers and the ruled.\n\nIn January, a YouGov poll found that 38% of Brits under the age of 40 would refuse to answer the call to enlist in the event of a world war.\n\nThe Democrats enforced a similar madness on the American people: a denial of the basics.\n\nTrump restates the simple truths:\n\nThe world is a cruel place.\n\nA state cannot stand without borders.\n\nA nation will disintegrate if illegal immigration continues.\n\nA democracy cannot serve its citizens if non-citizens can vote and the courts are corrupted.\n\nA man cannot become a woman.\n\nFix these foundations, and the American people will do the rest.\n\nTrump summoned “a country of doers, dreamers, fighters, survivors” to embrace the future. \n\nThere is a nation to rebuild, a world to repair, and no time to lose.\n\nDominic Green is a Wall Street Journal contributor and a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society.

I completely agree with you on that,’ Newsom responds. ‘It is an issue of fairness. It’s deeply unfair.’\n\nKirk challenged him to call out the case of AB Hernandez, a high school trans athlete dominating women’s long jump and triple jump in California.\n\nNewsom avoided that case but said he agreed with Kirk’s overall stance that it was unfair for women to compete with an athlete born a man. \n\nBut he went on to say that it was important to ensure that vulnerable communities were protected.\n\n‘There’s also humility and grace … that these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well,’ he said. \n\n‘So both things I can hold in my hand. How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that I think you know is inherent in you, but not always expressed on the issue?’\n\nNewsom is widely expected to run for president in 2028. And he has shown a willingness to engage with conservatives and appear on Fox News as he dissects the wreckage of Democrats’ 2024 election campaign.\n\nIn the first episode of his podcast he admitted that Democrats simply could not compete with the reach of Trump and Elon Musk right now. \n\n‘We’re toast,’ he said. \n\nHis new show is designed to bring him together with people on the opposing side. And he promised to interview architects of the MAGA movement.\n\n‘This is going to be anything but the ordinary politician podcast,’ he said. ‘I’m going to be talking to people directly that i disagree with, as well as people I look up to.’ \n\nBut supporters and even his own staff will be shocked at how much they agreed on an issue that was weaponized bu Donald Trump and his supporters to show how liberal Democrats had lost the plot.\n\nNewsom said that his friends had raised the issue of fairness in sport, and as a father of four, including two girls, he understood the problem \n\n‘Even my own friend cohort … people say: What the hell is going on, why aren’t you calling this out? When did this happen?’ he said.\n\nAsking questions about the fairness of transgender athletes should not be off limits, he said: ‘We have to own it.’ \n\nPublic opinion has hardened on the issue.\n\nA recent Pew Research Center survey found that two thirds of American adults favor or strongly favor laws require trans athletes to compete on teams that match their birth sex. \n\nOn Tuesday it provided Trump with one of his biggest applause lines when he announced he had signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women’s sports. \n\nDuring the closing weeks of the 2024 campaign, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris struggled to respond to her stance on transgender rights.\n\nNow, with Republicans in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, party thinkers are trying to work out how to come back from Trump’s big win in the culture wars.\n\nNewsom discussed some of those big issues with Kirk, a firebrand activist and head of Turning Point USA who is known for his take-no-prisoners approach.\n\nHe is now a key figure in Trump Land, sitting in on crucial meetings at Mar-a-Lago while the incoming president built his administration at the end of last year.\n\nAt times he seemed to school Newsom, who admitted his 13-year-old son was a fan of Kirk’s during their back and forth on what happened in the 2024 election.\n\n‘I’s not just that this was like the Willie Horton ad of 2024 it wasn’t just like a Lee Atwater brilliance,’ he said referencing an ad designed to stoke racial fears or a legendary political strategist, ‘it’s that it reflected truth that the voters felt.’ \n\n‘I appreciate that ,’ said Newsom. \n\n‘Because voters felt as if their country was slipping away,’ continued Kirk. \n\n‘Now you have … the Democrats have a choice. You can say to those people, you’re racist, you’re Nazis, you’re fascist, You’re terrible. Or you can listen and be like, why is it that a steel worker in Pittsburgh who’s voted Democrat his entire life is voting for Trump despite all of .. you know … the stuff that’s been thrown at him?’\n\n‘It’s a pattern, and the trans thing is just one of those things.’\n\nNewsom also faces up to the challenge facing Democrats. \n\n‘We are losing. I feel it’s asymmetric, the asymmetry of Donald Trump and Elon Musk sending out tweets, or you doing social media … to me doing a three minute hit at three o’clock in the afternoon on CNN. I mean, how the hell would we compete?’ he asks.\n\n‘We’re toast.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nGavin Newsom, governor of uber-liberal California, broke ranks with fellow Democrats on&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Gavin Newsom disagrees with California liberals and criticizes transgender athletes competing in women&#8217;s sports during a discussion with Charlie Kirk: &#8216;It&#8217;s very unjust&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/gavin-newsom-disagrees-with-california-liberals-and-criticizes-transgender-athletes-competing-in-womens-sports-during-a-discussion-with-charlie-kirk-its-very-unjust/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/06/02/95893961-14466989-image-a-37_1741227221356.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-07 00:17:07","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.226},{"id":297532474,"title":"Biden ‘green’ pork for pals is an epic example of insider feeding","text":"In its final days, the Biden administration handed out billions to freshly founded “climate” outfits in a scramble to pump taxpayer money to lefty activists — and all of the slimy details are coming to light, thanks to new Environmental Protection Agency chief Lee Zeldin.\n\nLast month, Zeldin announced his team had sniffed out $20 billion in taxpayer money from this Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund that had been parked at an outside institution (CitiBank, it turned out) until it could be doled out to a handful of far-left climate nonprofits.\n\nThey must have heard the dinner bell ringing.\n\nClimate United Fund got nearly $7 billion (handed over via a check from Vice President Kamala Harris) just five months after being incorporated in November 2023. \n\nJustice Climate Fund, which pocketed $940 million, was set up in 2023 and has yet to submit a single tax filing to the IRS. \n\nPower Forward Communities Inc. nabbed $2 billion from the public pot, despite also being set up in 2023 and showing only $100 in revenue for that entire year. \n\nThat org is partnered with Rewiring America, where former Georgia legislator and famous election denier Stacey Abrams is employed as “corporate counsel.”\n\nSensing the pattern here? \n\nThe slush-fund money was doled out to brand-spanking-new, completely unproven charities that sure look like little more than shell companies for Dem-connected operators. \n\nThey were picked to act as middlemen who could then decide, with zero federal oversight, which other nonprofits or projects would get a cut of the pie, away from the public’s prying eyes.\n\nAccountability is for suckers!\n\n“Cynical” doesn’t begin to describe this cash-grab: In bill labeled the Inflation Reduction Act, it allocated hundreds of billions in the name of fighting climate change, with this major chunk of the outlays going straight to connected cronies with zero effort to see that it did any good beyond enriching progressive/Democratic allies. \n\nIt may not be illegal, but it’s still burning taxpayer dollars to pad your pals’ pockets.\n\nAs Zeldin told The Post: “Of the eight pass-through entities that received funding from the pot of $20 billion in tax dollars, various recipients have shown very little qualification to handle a single dollar, let alone several billions of dollars.”\n\nHe’s called for the EPA’s inspector general to investigate; who knows what other rank misuse that might turn up. \n\nRetrieving $20 billion won’t put a dent in the national debt, but Zeldin’s efforts to claw it back are meaningful just the same. \n\nThe era of funneling public cash to shady nonprofits that pay lip service to the “right” causes must end — at least, if we ever want Americans to trust their government again.","summary":"The slush-fund money was doled out to brand-spanking-new, completely unproven charities.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/06/opinion/biden-administration-gave-taxpayer-money-to-leftist-climate-nonprofits/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/Trump_EPA_Climate_36205-fc19d-e1741305350336.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-07 00:10:47","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.467},{"id":297527602,"title":"Newsom Splits With Democrats on Transgender Athletes: 'It's Deeply Unfair'","text":"WASHINGTON -- Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, embarking on a personal post-mortem of the failures of his Democratic Party, suggested this week that the participation of transgender athletes in women's sports was \"deeply unfair.\"\n\nThe comments by Newsom, who has backed LGBTQ+ causes for decades and was one of the first American elected officials to officiate same-sex weddings, represented a remarkable break from other top Democrats on the issue and signaled a newly defensive position on transgender rights among many in his party.\n\nJust as surprising as Newsom's remarks was the person to whom he made them: Charlie Kirk, 31, a right-wing influencer best known for starting Turning Point USA, the pro-Trump organization that is active on college campuses.\n\nNewsom invited Kirk, who has a long history of inflammatory and conspiratorial remarks, onto the debut episode of his new podcast, \"This Is Gavin Newsom,\" for an 81-minute discussion. The governor, who has long been fascinated with the conservative media ecosystem and tried to inject himself into it, explained his unlikely guest by saying, \"People need to understand your success, your influence, what you've been up to.\"\n\nNewsom is widely seen as having presidential ambitions in 2028 -- something he joked about on the podcast. For years, he was one of the fiercest Democratic antagonists toward President Donald Trump, casting himself as a next-generation liberal warrior fluent in conservative orthodoxy who could lead his party into the post-Biden era.\n\nBut in recent months, he has softened his tone toward Trump and attacked Democrats over their strategy. In December, Newsom cursed the president-elect's name in an interview with The New York Times, but shortly after the inauguration, the governor traveled to Washington for a meeting with Trump to discuss funding for wildfire relief.\n\nNewsom spent much of his conversation with Kirk reflecting on the myriad ways that former Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign failed to reach key voters during the 2024 election, losing ground with young people, men and Hispanic voters.\n\nBut his most significant revelation on his podcast, which was released Thursday morning, came when Kirk pressed the California governor to agree with him that it was unfair for transgender women to compete in women's sports.\n\n\"I think it's an issue of fairness; I completely agree with you on that,\" Newsom said. \"It is an issue of fairness. It's deeply unfair.\"\n\nHe also acknowledged the effectiveness of Trump's signature campaign ad, which declared, \"Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\"\n\n\"It was devastating,\" Newsom said. \"And she didn't even react to it, which was even more devastating.\"\n\nSince Democrats' election loss last year, Newsom has become the most prominent official in the party to lament its position on transgender participation in sports, but he is hardly the first. Hours after the presidential race was called, Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., told the Times that he did not want his young daughters \"getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete,\" a remark that set off weeks of blowback.\n\nA New York Times/Ipsos poll conducted in January found that more than two-thirds of Democratic voters thought that transgender women should not be allowed to compete in women's sports.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has taken steps to try to erase transgender people from American life. He has eliminated the T -- for transgender -- from federal LGBTQ+ policies online and moved to ban transgender people from serving in the military.\n\nTrump also signed an executive order meant to prohibit transgender women and girls from competing in women's sports, directing federal agencies to withhold funding from schools if they did not comply. A day later, the NCAA instituted such a ban. More than two dozen states now bar transgender athletes from school sports, whether in K-12 schools or at colleges.\n\nDemocrats have shown increased caution on the issue, but many have tried to push back. On Monday, the party's senators blocked a Republican bill that closely resembled Trump's executive order, arguing that the GOP was seeking political gain by targeting a small, vulnerable group of children. Broadly, many Democrats have argued that athletic associations, not lawmakers, should decide who can participate in youth sports.\n\nScott Wiener, a Democratic state senator from San Francisco who is openly gay, said it was deeply disappointing to hear Newsom \"align\" with Republicans on the issue.\n\n\"It was a gut punch from any Democratic leader, and particularly from Gov. Newsom, because he has been such a staunch ally for the LGBTQ community,\" Wiener said.\n\nKelley Robinson, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBTQ+ advocacy group, said Newsom's comments were misguided and politically inept.\n\n\"The fight for equality has never been easy, but history doesn't remember those who waver; it remembers those who refuse to back down,\" Robinson said. \"Our message to Gov. Newsom and all leaders across the country is simple: The path to 2028 isn't paved with the betrayal of vulnerable communities.\"\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nOn his podcast, Newsom spoke at length about the political effectiveness of attacking transgender people in the presidential campaign. He called Trump's \"they/them\" commercial \"a great ad.\" He also questioned the practice of people announcing their preferred pronouns when introducing themselves.\n\n\"I had one meeting where people started going around the table with pronouns,\" Newsom said. \"I'm like, 'What the hell? Why is this the biggest issue?'\"\n\nBut at other points in the conversation, the governor criticized \"the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities\" and discussed the high rates of suicide and depression among transgender people.\n\n\"So, both things I can hold in my hand,\" he said.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nAt the beginning of Newsom's political career, after he was elected mayor of San Francisco in 2003, he officiated at same-sex weddings before they were allowed by law. He routinely participated in the city's famed Pride parade and for decades has supported expanding rights for LGBTQ+ people.\n\nHe is also the godfather to Nats Getty, a designer and oil heir who came out as transgender in 2021 and is married to Gigi Gorgeous, a transgender YouTube personality. The governor delivered a video toast at the couple's wedding in 2019.\n\nLast year, as school boards in conservative regions of California passed policies to require educators to notify parents if a child went by a different gender identity at school, Newsom signed a state law prohibiting such rules.\n\nLGBTQ+ advocates welcomed the law, while conservatives said it infringed on parents' rights. Elon Musk cited the law as a reason to move the headquarters of his company SpaceX to Texas from California.\n\nA California law that allows students to play on sports teams that align with their gender identities was signed in 2013 by Jerry Brown, the Democratic governor at the time. In recent months, Republican legislators have introduced bills to reverse it, but they have not yet been heard in committee. Democrats hold a supermajority in the California Legislature and typically scuttle bills they perceive as attacks on LGBTQ+ rights before they can reach Newsom's desk. He has not publicly taken a position on the new legislation.\n\nNewsom has also tried to show that he wants to talk with Republicans and is willing to tangle with them. He has kept up a regular line of communication with Sean Hannity, the conservative Fox News host; he debated Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, on live television in 2023; and he has long maintained private social media accounts curated to show him pro-Trump content.\n\nSo it was little surprise that Newsom expressed familiarity with the issues that most animated Kirk, who is himself a prominent podcaster and TikTok influencer. Newsom spent much of the discussion agreeing with Kirk on issues that have long been anathema to Democratic voters, seemingly working out in real time why Democrats lost ground to Republicans last year.\n\nAs to what the party should do next, Newsom blasted prominent Democrats -- notably, strategist James Carville -- who have suggested that the party allow Trump to become unpopular on his own and wait to offer a competing alternative.\n\n\"I'm thinking about, 'We're going to stand back and watch you run circles around us for six months, the next two or three years, waiting for the moment to finally strike,'\" Newsom said. \"Struck me as not necessarily the best advice.\"\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nNewsom also called his visit during the coronavirus pandemic to the French Laundry, one of the country's most expensive restaurants, the \"dumbest bonehead move of my life,\" adding, \"Own it, move on, grow up.\" That outing, which infuriated Californians who were living under rules discouraging gatherings, helped prompt a recall election in 2021 in which Newsom prevailed.\n\nThe governor also said that the only time he thought Joe Biden had experienced any \"mental decline\" during his aborted 2024 campaign was during a Hollywood fundraiser that preceded his disastrous debate performance. Several allies of Biden, including actor George Clooney, said later that the fundraiser had made them newly worried about the president's vigor.\n\n\"I saw a different person,\" Newsom said. \"That was the one time.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"WASHINGTON -- Gov.

It sparked an on-air mutiny as Rachel Maddow, Chuck Todd and many others demanded her ouster. After roughly 48 hours, that’s exactly what happened.\n\nIn 2022, CNN tried to boost its appeal to independent and right-leaning viewers. Its new owners brought in Chris Licht, vowing to invite more Republicans on-air and to return to the old CNN standards of objective journalism. \n\nBut a Trump town hall in 2023 so appalled anchor Anderson Cooper that he called the event “disturbing” and assured viewers it would be fine if they “never watched the network again.” Licht was fired not long after. \n\nFor Bezos, who announced the WaPo’s pivot on Feb. 26, the first big litmus test came on Tuesday night, during Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress.\n\nA group of the Washington Post’s top columnists provided running commentary of the event.\n\nThe paper’s headline: “‘We’re doomed’: 9 columnists on Trump’s address to Congress.”\n\nEnough said. \n\nYet polls afterward showed a major disconnect between these elites-with-bylines and the general public: A CBS poll found 76% of respondents saying they approved of Trump’s address; CNN’s poll clocked in at 69% approval. \n\nUntil Bezos makes some major changes to its staff, and he adds some who actually support Trump’s agenda in the name of balance, The Washington Post will never change. \n\nIn the meantime, he should stay the course. \n\nBecause whatever the WaPo has been doing to this point clearly ain’t working.\n\nJoe Concha is a Fox News contributor and author of the upcoming book “The Greatest Comeback Ever: Inside Trump’s Big Beautiful Campaign.”","summary":"Becoming the MSNBC of print has not only hurt the paper's credibility, but also its bottom line — and owner Jeff Bezos has finally had enough.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/06/opinion/cheers-for-jeff-bezos-fighting-for-truth-at-washington-post/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/newspress-collage-xh53jycrg-1741303088473.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1741285235&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-06 23:52:25","author":"Joe Concha","authors":["Joe Concha"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.09},{"id":297528520,"title":"Newsom condemned for ‘throwing trans people under bus’ after sports comment","text":"Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California believed to be eyeing a run for president in 2028, is facing fierce backlash from LGBTQ+ rights advocates after his suggestion that the participation of transgender women and girls in female sports was “deeply unfair”.\n\nIn the inaugural episode of his podcast, This Is Gavin Newsom, the governor hosted conservative political activist and Maga darling Charlie Kirk. The co-founder and executive director of the rightwing Turning Point USA, a Phoenix-based organization that operates on school campuses, told Newsom: “You, right now, should come out and be like: ‘You know what? The young man who’s about to win the state championship in the long jump in female sports – that shouldn’t happen.’ You, as the governor, should step out and say: ‘No.’”\n\nThe governor responded: “I think it’s an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that … it’s deeply unfair.”\n\nMembers of his own party in California quickly condemned the comments.\n\n“We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks,” assembly member Chris Ward and senator Caroline Menjivar, of the California legislative LGBTQ+ caucus, said in a statement. “All students deserve the academic and health benefits of sports activity, and until Donald Trump began obsessing about it, playing on a team consistent with one’s gender has not been a problem since the standard was passed in 2013.”\n\nCalifornia law has long protected trans youth’s rights to participate in school activities that match their gender.\n\nThe governor’s remarks also earned him scorn from national LGBTQ+ rights leaders, with the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) president, Kelley Robinson, saying in a statement: “History doesn’t remember those who waver – it remembers those who refuse to back down.”\n\nNewsom’s comments saw him agreeing with one of the central anti-trans talking points of Republicans and rightwing activists, who have fueled moral panics about trans women in public spaces and trans youth healthcare in recent years. Out of more than 500,000 college athletes, there are fewer than 10 who are trans and out, officials recently said.\n\nProponents of anti-trans restrictions for K-12 students have often struggled to find examples of trans girls playing in school sports.\n\nThe few openly trans athletes who are in the public eye have faced intense harassment and scrutiny. Civil rights advocates argue that for youth, their ability to play sports that align with their gender is a matter of basic dignity and equal protection under the law.\n\nA spokesperson for Newsom declined to comment, but pointed out that in the podcast, the governor noted the high rates of suicide and anxiety among trans people, saying: “The way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with. So, both things I can hold in my hand.”\n\nBamby Salcedo, a longtime Los Angeles-based activist and president of the TransLatin@ Coalition, said it was devastating to hear Newsom fail to even correct Kirk when he appeared to be referring to trans women as men.\n\n“For someone who says he is supportive of our communities to come out and say these awful things, he’s using us as political pawns,” she said.\n\n“Denying the opportunity for young people to participate in sports is denying them the opportunity to be who they fully are. It is really damaging.”\n\nScott Wiener, a state senator and proponent of trans rights, said in an interview that he considered Newsom a longtime ally of LGBTQ+ people and that it had been “brutal” to hear the governor’s comments. He noted there has been a “decades-long strategic plan by the right wing to demonize trans people”, adding: “They’ve done it very methodically. It’s disgusting, but it’s had some success.”\n\nTrans youth in the public eye have faced national ridicule, Wiener noted: “If they’re out as trans, they’re so courageous and they’re putting themselves at risk. It’s really important for people who know better to have their backs.”\n\nWiener, who has introduced legislation to strengthen the state’s trans refuge law, said Newsom has had a good track record on trans civil rights bills, and he hoped that wouldn’t change.\n\nState assemblymember Alex Lee, another LGBTQ+ caucus member, said Newsom’s remarks were “shocking and offensive” and that it would hurt his future ambitions: “Throwing trans people under the bus will alienate lots of people who are LGBTQ+ and allies across the nation … If you’re running to be a Republican nominee, this is a great strategy. But if you want to run as a Democrat and someone who is pro-human rights, this is a terrible look.”\n\nSome California Republicans were dubious of Newsom, a longtime champion of LGBTQ+ rights who drew national attention when, as the mayor of San Francisco, he defied state law and began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\n“This is stunning,” the California assemblymember Bill Essayli wrote on X. “Talk is cheap @GavinNewsom. Why don’t you support my bill AB 844 to reverse CA’s law allowing boys to compete in girls sports? You’re the Governor, not a commentator!”\n\nDonald Trump made the issue of trans women in sports a central pillar of his campaign and as president has tried to erase trans and non-binary Americans from public life.\n\nHe signed an executive order declaring that the federal government would only recognize two sexes, male and female, and another titled Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports, which threatens to withhold federal funds from schools that do not comply. Meanwhile, the US state department has ordered officials worldwide to deny visas to transgender athletes attempting to come to the US for sports competitions, including the Olympics, which Los Angeles will host in 2028.\n\nDuring his joint speech to Congress this week, the president spotlighted the story of a volleyball player who was injured by a trans athlete on the opposing team and threatened to pull federal funding from any school that defied his executive order.\n\nEarlier this week, Senate Democrats banded together to block a Republican bill that would have barred transgender women and girls from playing on female sports teams.\n\n“What Republicans are doing today is inventing a problem to stir up a culture war and divide people against each other and distract people from what they’re actually doing,” the senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat of Hawaii, said in a floor speech during debate over the bill on Monday. Instead of addressing the most pressing issues of the day, such as rising grocery costs and a growing measles outbreak, Schatz said, Republicans were instead focused on an issue that was “totally irrelevant to 99.9% of all people across the country”.\n\nSince Kamala Harris’s 2024 loss, Democrats have been embroiled in a debate over what went wrong, ostensibly the reason for the governor’s podcast in which he will “talk directly with people I disagree with”. Desperate for answers, some Democrats have pointed to the party’s support for trans rights as a reason for their defeat.\n\nIn the interview, Newsom conceded Trump’s signature campaign ad – “Kamala is for they/them, President Trump is for you” – was both “brutal” and effective.\n\n“She didn’t even react to it, which was even more devastating,” the governor told Kirk.\n\n“It’s not just that this was like the Willie Horton ad of the 2024 [cycle]. It wasn’t just like Lee Atwater brilliance. It’s that it reflected truth that the voters felt,” Kirk said. “Yeah, I appreciate that,” Newsom interjected, as Kirk continued: “Because voters felt as if their country was slipping away.”\n\nAs Democrats search for a way out of the political wilderness, and grapple with their position on the issue, LGBTQ+ rights advocates are warning the party not to play into Republicans’ hands.\n\n“Our message to [Governor] Newsom and all leaders across the country is simple,” Robinson, of the Human Rights Campaign said. “The path to 2028 isn’t paved with the betrayal of vulnerable communities – it’s built on the courage to stand up for what’s right and do the hard work to actually help the American people.”","summary":"Democratic California governor faces backlash after saying trans women playing in female sports was ‘deeply unfair’\n\nGavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California believed to be eyeing a run for president in 2028, is facing fierce backlash from LGBTQ+ rights advocates after his suggestion that the participation of transgender women and girls in female sports was “deeply unfair”.\n\nIn the inaugural episode of his podcast, This Is Gavin Newsom, the governor hosted conservative political activist and Maga darling Charlie Kirk. The co-founder and executive director of the rightwing Turning Point USA, a Phoenix-based organization that operates on school campuses, told Newsom: “You, right now, should come out and be like: ‘You know what?

Hunt asked the governor who he thinks is the Democratic leader right now.\n\nThe 60-year-old Democrat paused for a few beats before answering.\n\n“I think the voting public, right now, is what I would say,” Walz responded. “We’re not going to have a charismatic leader ride in and save us from this.”\n\nHunt followed up by asking if Walz sees anyone who could “be a national Democratic figure?”\n\n“I see a whole lot of them,” Walz said. “I see young members of Congress stepping up, I see folks out there, I see it out here, state senators, state legislators, folks that are getting ready. Labor union members who are out there talking. I think the thing we need to do is: We can’t cede the space. If Donald Trump’s going to be out there…we have to be there every day.”\n\n“We need to be better organized. There is going to be an organic uprising which we’re seeing.”\n\nWhen Hunt asked if former Vice President Kamala Harris could be that future leader, Walz responded: “I certainly think she could be.”\n\nWalz isn’t the first to contend with this question. Since Harris’s loss last Election Day, Democratic lawmakers have expressed discontent with their party’s leadership — or lack thereof.\n\n“There’s no one, certainly, that the party, I would argue, looks to, or feels led by, or inspired by, is the truth,” former Democratic Representative Dean Phillips told The Hill last month. “Any organization — business, for-profit, nonprofit, political party — that lacks spirited leadership is going to suffer. And I think you can count us among those organizations right now. There’s just no question.”\n\nA new poll from the liberal firm Blueprint first obtained by Politico also indicates 40 percent of voters believe that Democrats do not have any strategy for combatting the Trump administration.\n\nThat division was made clear when Democrats had a variety of responses to Trump’s joint congressional address on Tuesday. Many silently listened, others walked out and some wore pink in protest. Representative Al Green, a Democrat from Texas, was even removed from the chamber for repeatedly interrupting Trump at the beginning of the address.\n\n“Last night I stood up for those who need Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security. Democrats will never abandon the fight to make sure every American has a safe, healthy, and financially secure life. #ISaidWhatISaid,” Green wrote on X on Wednesday night.\n\nGreen’s fellow lawmakers voted to censure him on Thursday. Nearly every Republican and 10 Democrats voted in favor of the resolution.","summary":"Governor who ran alongside Kamala Harris last year predicted his former running mate could one day lead the party","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/walz-harris-democratic-party-leadership-b2710560.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/03/12/54/Democratic-Vice-Presidential-nominee-Tim-Walz-speaks-at-a-campaign-rally-in-Pennsylvania-z6dngkce.jpeg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-06 22:49:52","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.332},{"id":297516316,"title":"Gavin Newsom splits with Democrats on transgender athletes","text":"California Gov. Gavin Newsom, one of the most prominent Democratic party voices, said Thursday on his new podcast that it's \"deeply unfair\" to allow transgender women to participate in women's sports, marking a turn for a politician who first made national headlines when he issued marriage licenses for same-sex couples as San Francisco mayor in 2004.Newsom is already facing blowback from his own party after comments he made in the debut episode of his podcast \"This is Gavin Newsom.\"The podcast is being touted by Newsom as a way to \"change the conversation\" by talking directly to people on the opposite side of his politics. In the first episode, released Thursday, Newsom sits down with conservative media figure Charlie Kirk from Turning Point USA.Newsom waded into the issue of transgender athletes after Kirk mentions the recent news of a high school trans athlete in California who won a girls' triple jump event.\"I think it's an issue of fairness, I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness, it's deeply unfair,\" Newsom said. Further into the conversation, Newsom talked about a Trump campaign ad that ran ahead of the 2024 presidential election, which highlighted then-Vice President Kamala Harris' previous support for gender-affirming care for incarcerated people.\"She didn't even react to it, which was even more devastating,\" Newsom told Kirk.Newsom's comments seem to run counter to the governor's longstanding support of the LGBTQ+ community. After the podcast debuted Thursday, the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus released a statement calling Newsom's comments \"anti-transgender.\"\"Sometimes Gavin Newsom goes for the Profile in Courage, sometimes not. We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks,\" said Assemblymember Chris Ward (D-San Diego) and state Sen.

Europe and NATO are run by liberals who want to embrace the transgender ideology and hold gay pride parades, while Russia has said “nyet” to that while enacting pro-life laws instead.\n\nThe liberal hatred of Russia predates the war in Ukraine, and many of the thousand-strong anti-J.D. Vance protesters who lined narrow snow-covered Vermont roads on Saturday were motivated by social issues. Some waved LGBTQ flags while others were part of transgender activism, both of which Russia prohibits and would exclude from territory it annexes.\n\nIn 2020, Russians amended their Constitution to ensure that marriage remains only “the union of a man and a woman,” and in 2022 Russia broadened its ban on “LGBT propaganda” to include adults. Transgender treatment is not allowed in Russia, while transgender adults cannot adopt children.\n\nOn Nov. 30, 2023, the Supreme Court of Russia held that the “international public LGBT movement” is “extremist.” Displaying the LGBTQ rainbow flag in Russia can result in fines and imprisonment.\n\nPandering to liberals’ hatred of Russia’s social policies, Obama refused to attend its Winter Olympics in 2014 and spoke disparagingly of the country. In December 2016, Obama insulted Russia as a “smaller” and “weaker country,” which fails to “produce anything that anybody wants to buy except oil and gas and arms.”\n\nDemocrats falsely insisted that Trump’s presidential victory over Hillary Clinton was due to Russia, and Democrats used their fiction to disrupt two years of Trump’s first administration. Ukrainian President Zelensky, who refuses to allow an election to replace him, campaigned in Pennsylvania for Democrat Kamala Harris against Trump last fall.\n\nThe Left cannot accept any victory by Russia. When Vice President Vance told Zelensky at the White House that his regime is “going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems,” Zelensky did not deny it.\n\nRep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., is the only member of Congress born in Ukraine. She recently described Zelensky’s government as “worthless,” and observed that “the American people want to see what we’re getting in return” for the hundreds of billions of dollars we’ve sent there.\n\nWe should stop arming Ukraine to fight for NATO’s liberal social agenda. On Sunday, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, wisely declared, “If NATO’s moving on without the U.S., we should move on without NATO. Time to leave.”\n\nThis echoes what Phyllis Schlafly said against NATO in 2016, when she wrote that NATO repudiates George Washington’s advice “to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world.” Phyllis repeatedly warned against our entanglement through NATO in foreign wars in 1996, 1998 and 1999, during the wars of NATO aggression in Bosnia, Kosovo and Serbia.\n\nIt is not the moral duty of the United States to intervene in every foreign war. As Trump says, the Ukraine-Russia war would have been over quickly if the United States had not propped Zelensky up with aid that thereby prolonged it.\n\nOn Monday, Trump properly halted the delivery of military aid by the U.S. to Ukraine, after Zelensky harmfully declared that peace with Russia is “still very, very far away.”\n\n“This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky, and America will not put up with it for much longer!” the president responded on TruthSocial.\n\nThere was in excess of $1 billion in arms and ammunition scheduled for delivery to Ukraine. Trump was right to withhold that, at least until Zelensky makes a good-faith effort toward ending a war that has killed or wounded more than a million people.\n\n“We should spend less time worrying about Putin, and more time worrying about migrant rape gangs, drug lords, murderers, and people from mental institutions entering our Country – So that we don’t end up like Europe!” Trump tweeted on Sunday.\n\nRussia is more like conservative states in the U.S. on social issues than Europe and Zelensky are, as Russian laws reject the trans agenda and abortion-on-demand as many states here do. Yet on Friday, Zelensky warned Trump that our country “will feel it in the future” as the next victim of Russia if we decline to continue fighting it in Ukraine.\n\nThat warning of our American president by a foreign official was both unjustified and insulting, and Trump properly admonished Zelensky for it. “Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel. We’re trying to solve a problem,” Trump responded.\n\nTrump continued, “You’re in no position to dictate that. Remember this, you’re in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel good. We’re gonna feel very good and very strong,” and Trump’s right due to his strong leadership.","summary":"'We should stop arming Ukraine to fight for NATO's liberal agenda'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/03/world-realigns-based-on-social-issues/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/family-children-parents-adoption-silhouette-water-lake-Unsplash.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-06 21:45:16","author":"Andy Schlafly","authors":["Andy Schlafly"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":297504212,"title":"Turns out Gavin Newsom and Charlie Kirk actually agree on something","text":"In the debut episode of his new politics podcast, California Gov. Gavin Newsom suggested that his party members were mistaken for arguing that transgender women and girls should be allowed to participate in sports teams consistent with their gender identity. \n\nFor the first episode of “This is Gavin Newsom,” the governor sat down with conservative provocateur Charlie Kirk for a discussion about the state of the Democratic Party. According to Mediaite, Newsom asked Kirk for “advice” and argued that people “need to understand your success.” (Kirk, a conservative influencer and ally of President Donald Trump, whose policies have had a devastating effect on LGBTQ+ youth, likely has no insight into what messages can benefit the left.)\n\n“Would you say ‘no’ to men in female sports?” Kirk asked the governor.\n\n“Well, I think it’s an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness; it’s deeply unfair,” Newsom replied. “I am not wrestling with the fairness issue. I totally agree with you.”\n\nDuring their 75-minute tête-à-tête, Kirk also encouraged Newsom to speak out against AB Hernandez, a transgender high school track star from California who has received backlash from conservatives after setting the record for the highest triple jump in the girls’ competition. In response to a question about Hernandez, according to Politico, Newsom went off on a tangent about his four children and noted that he and his wife both participated in college-level sports. \n\n“I revere sports, so the issue of fairness is entirely legitimate,” Newsom stated. “And I saw that—the last couple of years, boy did I [see] how you guys were able to exploit that issue at another level.”\n\nPolitico noted that Kirk debated Newsom’s use of the word “exploit,” which Newsom replaced with “highlight.”\n\nWhile some conservatives have criticized Kirk for appearing on the podcast, Newsom admitting that his party is getting “crushed” on transgender issues is arguably more devastating. The Democratic Party was already shifting right on immigration—hopefully, the takeaway from the party’s defeat in 2024 wasn’t that potential 2028 presidential hopefuls should start aligning with conservatives on policies affecting LGBTQ+ Americans as well.\n\nIndeed, on his podcast, according to Politico, Newsom also acknowledged that one of Trump’s most damaging ads against former Vice President Kamala Harris was one where the president called out Harris’s support for providing taxpayer-funded gender transition-related care for detained migrants during her 2020 presidential run. \n\n“She didn’t even react to it, which was even more devastating,” Newsom said of Harris’s response. “Then you had the video [of Harris] as a validator. Brutal. It was a great ad.”\n\nOf course, Trump’s attack and Newsom’s comments on Harris’s position lacked nuance. As Politifact reported last year, federal statute requires that inmates receive access to necessary medical care, which can include gender-affirming surgery. Trump adhered to this ruling during his first term in office, the outlet noted, as any effort to eliminate access to this care would run afoul of the law.\n\nIn an interview with Daily Kos, a spokesperson for Newsom defended the governor’s decision to initiate a new podcast venture and to prominently feature conservatives on it. Newsom has previously stated that his show would take inspiration from HBO’s “Real Time with Bill Maher,” another controversial host. \n\nRELATED | ‘We need to change the conversation’: Gavin Newsom starts new podcast\n\nWhile Newsom did, at one point, express sympathy for transgender individuals, it was arguably overshadowed by his more concerning comments about this population. \n\nHowever, Newsom’s criticism of his own party didn’t stop with their positions on transgender issues. According to Politico, the governor also distanced himself from the use of the gender-neutral term “Latinx,” referred to defunding the police as “lunacy,” and criticized perceived internal issues with the leadership of the Black Lives Matter organization. \n\nIt’s somewhat ironic that Newsom would bother to make comments about any of these things, as he previously criticized the right for not having its priorities in line—as conservatives at the time worked to ban “the word ‘Latinx’ and AP Black history courses” instead of addressing more pressing matters. Maybe the governor should follow his own advice and focus future episodes on some of the more pressing issues facing the nation.","summary":"In the debut episode of his new politics podcast, California Gov.

Wilson praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and attacked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, promoted theories widely seen as antisemitic, excoriated Republicans in Congress who supported Ukraine, frequently used a slur for people with intellectual disabilities and also appeared to support political violence.\n\nNow that Wilson is serving in the Pentagon, her comments have raised new scrutiny.\n\nAmy Spitalnick, the CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, told NPR Wilson's hiring was \"one of the more concerning examples I've seen over the last few months of extremists being given prominent roles in the federal government.\"\n\nAmong Wilson's comments that drew the toughest criticism were those regarding Leo Frank, a Jewish man who was lynched by an antisemitic mob in Georgia in 1915.\n\nHistorians widely believe that Frank was falsely accused of raping and murdering a 13-year-old girl, and the state of Georgia granted Frank a posthumous pardon in 1986. But many antisemitic extremists continue to argue that Frank was guilty. In 2023, neo-Nazis protested the Broadway musical \"Parade,\" which dramatizes Frank's trial and lynching.\n\n\"Leo Frank raped & murdered a 13-year-old girl. He also tried to frame a black man for his crime,\" Wilson wrote in 2023. She repeated the same sentiment in a post last year.\n\nSpitalnick said that Wilson's comments about Frank are especially notable, because they so closely align with neo-Nazi talking points.\n\n\"This is something that is a deep cut in terms of the sorts of antisemitic ideas that neo-Nazis and others latch on to,\" Spitalnick said. \"So for someone who is now in a senior role in the federal government to have directly and explicitly engaged in this sort of conspiracy theory tells me that she is frequently trafficking in these neo-Nazi and other antisemitic spaces.\"\n\n\"Anyone who posts antisemitic conspiracy theories lifted right out of the neo-Nazi playbook should not be in public office,\" wrote the American Jewish Committee on X, calling Wilson \"unfit\" for her job.\n\nMother Jones and Jewish Insider first reported many of Wilson's comments, including her stated belief in the \"great replacement theory,\" which the Anti-Defamation League describes as a \"racist conspiracy theory\" amplified by white nationalist groups. The \"great replacement theory\" poses that societal elites, often cast as Jewish leaders, are orchestrating mass migration to the United States in order to displace white people and seize power.\n\nRepublican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer told Politico that Wilson's comments were \"horrible\" and \"just not appropriate.\"\n\nWilson is not the first Trump administration official whose online commentary has attracted criticism. Marko Elez, an employee working with the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, resigned over racist posts he had written in recent years. \"Normalize Indian hate,\" one post read. \"Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool,\" Elez said in another.\n\nSoon after his resignation, the Trump administration rehired Elez, who is 25 years old. Vice President JD Vance wrote, \"I obviously disagree with some of Elez's posts, but I don't think stupid social media activity should ruin a kid's life.\"\n\nSeen in that light, Wilson's history of extreme rhetoric \"should be shocking, but it's certainly not surprising,\" said Spitalnick, \"because this administration has over and over again normalized platformed and emboldened extremism.\"\n\nThe Department of Defense did not respond to NPR's request for comment.\n\nNPR has identified additional comments that raise questions about Wilson's views and the Pentagon's decision to hire her.\n\nIn a 2023 interview on the right-wing channel One America News, Wilson said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \"should be arrested on sight for what he has done to the American taxpayer.\"\n\nBy contrast, Wilson has praised Putin. Last year, Wilson touted Putin's \"encyclopedic knowledge of his people's history,\" calling it \"beyond impressive.\" At the same time, she has attacked U.S. intelligence services, which include her current employer, the Department of Defense.\n\n\"The American intelligence apparatus is more evil than Vladimir Putin,\" Wilson posted in 2022, months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWilson also criticized U.S. defense contractors for their role in providing military equipment for the Ukrainian war effort.\n\n\"The U.S. Military Industrial Complex genocided an entire generation of Ukrainian men because PUTIN BAD\" she wrote in 2024.\n\nAmong Wilson's other targets are Republican leaders in Congress.\n\nIn one podcast interview from 2024, she said House Speaker Mike Johnson was \"weak-willed\" and lacked \"testicular fortitude,\" because he supported U.S. aid to Ukraine, adding that continuing to provide military support was \"an un-Christian thing to do.\"\n\n\"Mini-Mike Johnson is an embarrassment,\" she posted later that year.\n\n\"DEPORT Lindsey Graham & ship him to Ukraine!\" she posted regarding the Republican U.S. Senator from South Carolina over his support for that country.\n\nWilson is 26 years old and comes from a political family. Her father is Steve Cortes, a former Trump campaign adviser. Like many young right-wing activists, she appears to have adopted a deliberately edgy and often trolling online persona. The Trump administration's media strategy has also shunned mainstream news organizations, while embracing figures who were once on the fringe.\n\nOver the course of several posts, Wilson used a slur for people with intellectual disabilities to attack former Vice President Kamala Harris, members of NATO and libertarians.\n\nAnd she has seemed to justify political violence.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, a conservative, called for his supporters to \"be peaceful\" after he lost his reelection campaign.\n\nWilson responded online, \"I'm so tired of being the 'good guys.' Our ancestors answered violence with violence.\"\n\nThe following year, she wrote, \"There can be virtue in violence.\"\n\nIn other posts, she has expressed support for colonialism, the Confederacy of the United States and a belief that the U.S is based on \"blood and soil.\"\n\n\"Colonialism was a humanitarian venture,\" Wilson wrote of Haiti in 2024.\n\nWilson called Confederate General Robert E. Lee, who fought to preserve slavery, \"One of the greatest Americans to ever live.\" She also praised \"Pickett's Charge,\" an infantry assault by the Confederates during the battle of Gettysburg in 1863, as one of the most \"daring\" ever attempted.\n\nIn 2023, Wilson wrote that \"America is quite literally based on blood and soil.\"\n\nAccording to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the phrase \"blood and soil\" was \"an early Nazi slogan used in Germany to evoke the idea of a pure 'Aryan' race and the territory it wanted to conquer. The concept was foundational to Nazi ideology and its appeal.\" Some white nationalists have since adopted the rhetoric of \"blood and soil\" to advocate for restricting immigration, and the slogan was used at the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nWilson has also frequently expressed opposition to immigration.\n\n\"American communities across the country are being conquered by an invading horde of Third World migrants,\" Wilson wrote in 2024. \"Foundational Americans, who were never asked or consulted, are being made strangers in their own country.\"\n\n\"I think it's totally fair for us as American citizens to say, 'Not all cultures are equal. I recognize that some cultures don't assimilate well into my culture. And I don't want more of those people here,'\" Wilson said on a right-wing podcast in 2024.","summary":"Members of Congress and civil rights groups are condemning past comments from Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson, including some which critics called antisemitic.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/06/nx-s1-5319995/kingsley-wilson-antisemitic-comments-defense-department-pentagon","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1193x865+11+105/resize/1193x865!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F33%2F43%2F28c204154745b0580f5f681b8b9f%2Fkingsley-wilson-x.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-06 21:29:19","author":"Tom Dreisbach","authors":["Tom Dreisbach"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.06},{"id":297501642,"title":"Stranded NASA astronaut's daughter finally breaks silence as she lashes out: 'Negligence'","text":"EXCLUSIVEStranded NASA astronaut's daughter finally breaks silence as she lashes out: 'Negligence'\n\nREAD MORE: Stranded astronauts allude to who's at fault for their delayed return\n\nBy ELLYN LAPOINTE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 21:04 GMT, 6 March 2025 | Updated: 21:05 GMT, 6 March 2025\n\nThe teen daughter of stranded NASA astronaut Barry Wilmore has spoken out about her dad for the first time, blaming 'negligence' for him being 'stuck in space.'\n\nIn a heartbreaking video quietly uploaded to social media last month, Daryn, 19, said that her father had 'missed out on a lot' during his uncertain nine-month stay in space — including Christmas and her parents' 30-year wedding anniversary.\n\nWilmore's wife and his two daughters live in Houston, Texas, where they have been patiently awaiting his return since June of last year. \n\n'It's been hard if we're completely honest', she said. Daryn said her frustration about her father's stay was 'less the fact that he's up there' and 'more the fact of why.'\n\n'There's a lot of politics, there's a lot of things that I'm not at liberty to say, and that I don't know fully about,' she said.\n\n'But there's been issues. There's been negligence. And that's the reason why this has just kept getting delayed. There's just been issue after issue after issue.'\n\nDaryn posted the video just weeks before SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk, whose company is tasked with bringing the Starliner crew back to Earth later this month, said the Biden administration left them in space for 'political reasons.' \n\nWilmore and his crewmate, Sunita Williams, were set to return from the ISS eight days after arriving, but their return capsule was plagued by issues and NASA delayed the flight home. They are set to come back to Earth no earlier than March 19.\n\nDaryn, 19, said that her father's delayed return is 'really frustrating' and noted that a 'nine-month delay is uncommon.' Pictured is her on the left, Wilmore and his wife Deanna\n\nThe teenaged daughter of stranded NASA astronaut Barry Wilmore has spoken out about her dad, blaming 'negligence' and 'politics' for his delayed return from space\n\nWhile stuck in space, Wilmore also missed most of his 16-year-old daughter Logan's senior year of high school and Daryn's college theater performances.\n\nLogan has been open about missing her dad as well. \n\nIn a video posted in August, she shared a clip of her father getting ready to board Starliner followed by another of her hugging him, with the caption: 'Not dead, just stuck in space. I'm not worried at all, just miss him!'\n\nAnother video in October served as a heartwarming tribute to her dad, featuring a slideshow of photos of the two of them together.\n\nBut the sisters have been able to keep in touch with their dad through regular video calls. \n\n'I talk to my dad all the time,' Daryn said, adding that she calls him every day or every couple of days. \n\n'That makes things really nice,' she added.\n\nDaryn also said the fact that her dad will most likely be coming home in mid-March is 'so exciting.'\n\n'I miss him so much,' she said, adding she can't wait to hug him and feels glad that he will be able to see her take the stage in an upcoming theater performance and see Logan graduate high school this spring. \n\n'But fingers crossed, things could always change. And especially with this whole thing — we've had so many changes. And it's a bit mentally exhausting,' she said. \n\nAlthough both Wilmore's daughters admit that the months they have spent without him have been challenging, they have both said they are not worried about him. \n\n'He's just been bummed, but he's fine. My dad is very resilient,' Daryn said. \n\nWilmore left behind his wife Deanna (left) and two daughters Daryin (center left) and Logan (center right) when he launched into space on June 5.

I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe that you would be hoping for,' he added.\n\nIn a Wednesday X post, Musk wrote: 'The astronauts were only supposed to be up there for 8 days and now have been there for 8 months. SpaceX could have sent up another Dragon and brought them home 6 months ago, but the Biden-Harris White House (not NASA) refused to allow it.\n\n'President Trump asked to bring them back as soon as possible and we are doing so.'\n\nWilliams and Wilmore will hitch a ride home on SpaceX's Crew-9 Dragon spacecraft later this month and are due back on Earth around March 19 or 20.\n\nTheir original spacecraft, Starliner, was sent home without them in September following numerous thruster issues and helium leaks.\n\nThese technical issues would have posed too much of a risk to Williams and Wilmore's safety had they tried to return home in the ship.\n\nNasaEarthSpaceX\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nStranded NASA astronaut's daughter finally breaks silence as she lashes out: 'Negligence'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The teenage daughter of stranded NASA astronaut Barry Wilmore has broken her silence, saying her father's delayed return is 'really frustrating' and noting that a 'nine-month delay is uncommon.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14469957/nasa-astronaut-daughters-break-silence-barry-wilmore.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/06/20/95925227-0-Wilmore_left_behind_his_wife_Deanna_left_and_two_daughters_Daryi-a-48_1741294763143.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-06 21:05:48","author":"Editor,Ellyn Lapointe","authors":["Editor","Ellyn Lapointe"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.065},{"id":297491616,"title":"Ghana Month: From war airbase to global gateway – KIA’s evolution and Ghana’s airline struggle","text":"In the heart of Ghana’s growing aviation landscape stands Kotoka International Airport (KIA), a symbol of the nation’s journey through history and progress.\n\nKIA has received honours due to its excellence in service quality and passenger experience. It was named the Best Airport by Size and Region (2-5 million passengers per year) in Africa by Airports Council International in the 2021 Airport Service Quality (ASQ) Awards, having previously won in the same category in 2019 and 2020.\n\nOriginally built as a military airbase during World War II, KIA has transformed over the decades into one of West Africa’s busiest airports.\n\nHowever, despite its modern facilities and strategic position, Ghana still lacks a national airline—a gap that has persisted for nearly two decades.\n\nKIA’s story dates back to the early 1940s when it served as a crucial airbase for British and Allied forces. Following Ghana’s independence in 1957, the airbase was converted into a civilian airport and named Accra International Airport. In 1969, it was renamed in honor of Lieutenant General Emmanuel Kwasi Kotoka, the military officer who played a role in Ghana’s first coup d’état.\n\nOver the years, Kotoka International Airport (KIA) has undergone significant expansion. It now features three terminals, including the state-of-the-art Terminal 3, completed in 2018, which serves as the primary hub for international flights. With a 3,403-meter runway, KIA can accommodate some of the world's largest aircraft, including the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380. Notably, it has also hosted the Antonov AN-225 Mriya, the largest aircraft ever built.\n\nIn 2023, KIA welcomed the U.S. Air Force 2 during the historic visit of U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris to Ghana.\n\nThe airport handles approximately 5 million passengers annually, cementing its status as a major hub in the region.\n\nThe Struggle of a National Airline\n\nDespite Ghana’s investment in a world-class airport, the absence of a national airline remains a significant gap in its aviation industry. Ghana Airways, established in 1958 as the country’s flag carrier, was initially a partnership between the Government of Ghana (60%) and British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) (40%).\n\nIn 2002, the airline faced a severe financial crisis that weakened its staff strength and competitiveness. Much of its troubles stemmed from its earlier decision to become fully independent by purchasing BOAC’s 40% stake. This move, however, led to operational and financial difficulties, including issues with its Boeing fleet after the cancellation of an agreement with BOAC.\n\nThe crisis deepened when BOAC, seeking to recover an outstanding £4 million debt, obtained a legal injunction that resulted in the seizure of La Dante DC-10, one of Ghana Airways’ aircraft, at Heathrow Airport according to reports by The Guardian and The Telegraph.\n\nThe situation worsened when a £4 million lawsuit from British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) led to one of its aircraft being seized in London.\n\nThe aircraft was finally brought home and was turned into a restaurant serving up to 118 people in the Capital. Even as a restaurant, it didn’t survive — The La Tante DC-10 Restaurant was shut down in 2023.\n\nIn an attempt to revive the airline, Ghana International Airlines was launched in 2005 as a public-private partnership. However, it too faced financial difficulties and ceased operations in 2010, leaving the country without a national flag carrier.\n\nUnfulfilled Plans for Revival\n\nOver the years, multiple efforts to re-establish a national airline have stalled. In 2019, the government led by former President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Boeing to acquire three 787-9 Dreamliners at a cost of US$877.5 million at the Dubai Air Show, with EgyptAir along in partnering on the project. However, these plans have yet to materialize.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Ghana’s aviation sector continues to thrive, with KIA serving as the gateway to the country. Airlines such as British Airways, Emirates, Delta, Qatar, Kenyan and Ethiopian Airlines operate frequent flights to and from Accra, connecting Ghana to major destinations worldwide.\n\nAs Ghana celebrates its heritage during Ghana Month, the question remains: will the country ever reclaim its national airline? While private airlines operate domestically and regionally, a national carrier could serve as a symbol of pride and economic opportunity.\n\nFor now, Kotoka International Airport remains a testament to Ghana’s aviation history—modern, busy, and globally connected, yet missing a crucial piece of its identity.","summary":"KIA has received honours due to its excellence in service quality and passenger experience.

Gavin Newsom of California, embarking on a personal post-mortem of the failures of his Democratic Party, suggested this week that the participation of transgender athletes in women's sports was \"deeply unfair.\"\n\nThe comments by Newsom, who has backed LGBTQ+ causes for decades and was one of the first American elected officials to officiate same-sex weddings, represented a remarkable break from other top Democrats on the issue and signaled a newly defensive position on transgender rights among many in his party.\n\nJust as surprising as Newsom's remarks was the person to whom he made them: Charlie Kirk, 31, a right-wing influencer best known for starting Turning Point USA, the pro-Trump organization that is active on college campuses.\n\nNewsom invited Kirk, who has a long history of inflammatory and conspiratorial remarks, onto the debut episode of his new podcast, \"This Is Gavin Newsom,\" for an 81-minute discussion. The governor, who has long been fascinated with the conservative media ecosystem and tried to inject himself into it, explained his unlikely guest by saying, \"People need to understand your success, your influence, what you've been up to.\"\n\nNewsom is widely seen as having presidential ambitions in 2028 -- something he joked about on the podcast. For years, he was one of the fiercest Democratic antagonists toward President Donald Trump, casting himself as a next-generation liberal warrior fluent in conservative orthodoxy who could lead his party into the post-Biden era.\n\nBut in recent months, he has softened his tone toward Trump and attacked Democrats over their strategy. In December, Newsom cursed the president-elect's name in an interview with The New York Times, but shortly after the inauguration, the governor traveled to Washington for a meeting with Trump to discuss funding for wildfire relief.\n\nNewsom spent much of his conversation with Kirk reflecting on the myriad ways that former Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign failed to reach key voters during the 2024 election, losing ground with young people, men and Hispanic voters.\n\nBut his most significant revelation on his podcast, which was released Thursday morning, came when Kirk pressed the California governor to agree with him that it was unfair for transgender women to compete in women's sports.\n\n\"I think it's an issue of fairness; I completely agree with you on that,\" Newsom said. \"It is an issue of fairness. It's deeply unfair.\"\n\nHe also acknowledged the effectiveness of Trump's signature campaign ad, which declared, \"Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\"\n\n\"It was devastating,\" Newsom said. \"And she didn't even react to it, which was even more devastating.\"\n\nSince Democrats' election loss last year, Newsom has become the most prominent official in the party to lament its position on transgender participation in sports, but he is hardly the first. Hours after the presidential race was called, Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., told the Times that he did not want his young daughters \"getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete,\" a remark that set off weeks of blowback.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has taken steps to try to erase transgender people from American life. He has eliminated the T -- for transgender -- from federal LGBTQ+ policies online and moved to ban transgender people from serving in the military.\n\nTrump also signed an executive order meant to prohibit transgender women and girls from competing in women's sports, directing federal agencies to withhold funding from schools if they did not comply. A day later, the NCAA instituted such a ban. More than two dozen states now bar transgender athletes from school sports, whether in K-12 schools or at colleges.\n\nDemocrats have shown increased caution on the issue, but many have tried to push back. On Monday, the party's senators blocked a Republican bill that closely resembled Trump's executive order, arguing that the GOP was seeking political gain by targeting a small, vulnerable group of children.\n\nScott Wiener, a Democratic state senator from San Francisco who is openly gay, said it was deeply disappointing to hear Newsom \"align\" with Republicans on the issue.\n\n\"It was a gut punch from any Democratic leader, and particularly from Gov. Newsom, because he has been such a staunch ally for the LGBTQ community,\" Wiener said.\n\nKelley Robinson, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBTQ+ advocacy group, said Newsom's comments were misguided and politically inept.\n\n\"The fight for equality has never been easy, but history doesn't remember those who waver; it remembers those who refuse to back down,\" Robinson said. \"Our message to Gov. Newsom and all leaders across the country is simple: The path to 2028 isn't paved with the betrayal of vulnerable communities.\"\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nOn his podcast, Newsom spoke at length about the political effectiveness of attacking transgender people in the presidential campaign. He called Trump's \"they/them\" commercial \"a great ad.\" He also questioned the practice of people announcing their preferred pronouns when introducing themselves.\n\n\"I had one meeting where people started going around the table with the pronouns,\" Newsom said. \"I'm like, 'What the hell? Why is this the biggest issue?'\"\n\nBut at other points in the conversation, the governor criticized \"the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities\" and discussed the high rates of suicide and depression among transgender people.\n\n\"So, both things I can hold in my hand,\" he said.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nAt the beginning of Newsom's political career, after he was elected mayor of San Francisco in 2003, he officiated at same-sex weddings before they were allowed by law. He routinely participated in the city's famed Pride parade and for decades has supported expanding rights for LGBTQ+ people.\n\nHe is also the godfather to Nats Getty, a designer and oil heir who came out as transgender in 2021 and is married to Gigi Gorgeous, a transgender YouTube personality. The governor delivered a video toast at the couple's wedding in 2019.\n\nLast year, as school boards in conservative regions of California passed policies to require educators to notify parents if a child went by a different gender identity at school, Newsom signed a state law prohibiting such rules.\n\nLGBTQ+ advocates welcomed the law, while conservatives said it infringed on parents' rights. Elon Musk cited the law as a reason to move the headquarters of his company SpaceX to Texas from California.\n\nA California law that allows students to play on sports teams that align with their gender identities was signed in 2013 by Jerry Brown, the Democratic governor at the time. In recent months, Republican legislators have introduced bills to reverse it, but they have not yet been heard in committee. Democrats hold a supermajority in the California Legislature and typically scuttle bills they perceive as attacks on LGBTQ+ rights before they can reach Newsom's desk. He has not publicly taken a position on the new legislation.\n\nNewsom has also tried to show that he wants to talk with Republicans and is willing to tangle with them. He has kept up a regular line of communication with Sean Hannity, the conservative Fox News host; he debated Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, on live television in 2023; and he has long maintained private social media accounts curated to show him pro-Trump content.\n\nSo it was little surprise that Newsom expressed familiarity with the issues that most animated Kirk, who is himself a prominent podcaster and TikTok influencer. Newsom spent much of the discussion agreeing with Kirk on issues that have long been anathema to Democratic voters, seemingly working out in real time why Democrats lost ground to Republicans last year.\n\nAs to what the party should do next, Newsom blasted prominent Democrats -- notably, strategist James Carville -- who have suggested that the party allow Trump to become unpopular on his own and wait to offer a competing alternative.\n\n\"I'm thinking about, 'We're going to stand back and watch you run circles around us for six months, the next two or three years, waiting for the moment to finally strike,'\" Newsom said. \"Struck me as not necessarily the best advice.\"\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nNewsom also called his visit during the coronavirus pandemic to the French Laundry, one of the country's most expensive restaurants, the \"dumbest bonehead move of my life,\" adding, \"Own it, move on, grow up.\" That outing, which infuriated Californians who were living under rules discouraging gatherings, helped prompt a recall election in 2021 in which Newsom prevailed.\n\nThe governor also said that the only time he thought Joe Biden had experienced any \"mental decline\" during his aborted 2024 campaign was during a Hollywood fundraiser that preceded his disastrous debate performance. Several allies of Biden, including actor George Clooney, said later that the fundraiser had made them newly worried about the president's vigor.\n\n\"I saw a different person,\" Newsom said. \"That was the one time.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"WASHINGTON -- Gov.

Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, used the inaugural episode of his new podcast to break from progressives by speaking out against allowing transgender women and girls to compete in female sports.\n\nNewsom made his declaration in an extended conversation with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old who built the influential Turning Point USA organization that helped President Donald Trump increase his support last fall among the youngest generation of voters. Kirk, like Trump, has been a vocal opponent of allowing transgender women and girls to participate.\n\n“I think it’s an issue of fairness, I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness — it’s deeply unfair,” Newsom told Kirk on “This is Gavin Newsom.”\n\n“I am not wrestling with the fairness issue,” continued Newsom, who played varsity baseball as a college student. “I totally agree with you. … I revere sports. So, the issue of fairness is completely legit.”\n\nThe governor’s comments are the latest in Democrats’ efforts to reconcile a 2024 election that returned Trump to the White House and gave Republicans control of both chambers of Congress. Among the disagreements since November is how much cultural issues – as opposed to economic policy and other matters – explain the party’s losses.\n\nOverall, polling suggests that allowing transgender female athletes to play on women’s teams isn’t broadly popular. Even most Democrats — around 7 in 10 — oppose allowing transgender female athletes to participate in women’s sports, according to a January New York Times/Ipsos poll. A 2023 Gallup poll also found that Democrats were divided on whether transgender people should be able to play on sports teams that match their current gender identity.\n\nNewsom, who has long positioned himself as a social progressive, drew sharp rebukes from LGBTQ advocates.\n\n“Sometimes Gavin Newsom goes for the Profile in Courage, sometimes not,” said California Assemblyman Chris Ward and state Sen. Carolina Menjivar, who lead the state’s LGBTQ legislative caucus. “We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks.”\n\nTony Hoang, executive director of Equality California, said he was “disappointed and angered” by Newsom’s statements and that they “added to the heartbreak and fear” the transgender community feels under the Trump administration.\n\n“Right now, transgender youth, their families, their doctors, and their teachers are facing unprecedented attacks from extremist politicians who want to eviscerate their civil rights and erase them from public life,” Hoang said. “They need leaders who will unequivocally fight for them.”\n\nCalifornia law, enacted before Newsom became governor, requires schools in the state to allow transgender athletes to play on school sports teams consistent with their gender identity.\n\nBeyond questions about athletics, there is less public support for broader restrictions on transgender rights and issues like medical care for transgender people, particularly among Democrats.\n\nAccording to AP VoteCast, 55% of voters in the 2024 election said support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far, while about 2 in 10 said it’s been about right and a similar share said it hasn’t gone far enough. Voters were also slightly more likely to oppose than favor laws that ban gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy, for minors who identify as transgender.\n\nBut Republicans have nonetheless sought to capitalize on the cultural touchstone that sports represent in America.\n\nTrump regularly hammered Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, Newsom’s fellow Californian, for supporting LGBTQ+ rights. Trump promised at his rallies to get “transgender insanity the hell out of our schools” and “keep men out of women’s sports.” His campaign also spent tens of millions of dollars on television and digital ads with the searing summation: “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”\n\n“Boy, did I see how you guys were able to weaponize it,” Newsom told Kirk, before yielding to Kirk’s protest and saying instead that the ads were an effective “highlight” during the campaign.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has threatened to withhold federal money from schools that allow transgender athletes to compete in women’s’ or girls’ events. He declared victory on the issue recently when the NCAA, which governs collegiate athletics in the U.S., changed its policy to restrict women’s sporting events to those athletes who were assigned the female gender at birth. Previously, the NCAA had a sport-by-sport policy determined by the respective sports’ national or international governing bodies.\n\nWard and Menjivar, the California lawmakers, said playing on a team consistent with one’s gender hasn’t been a problem “until Donald Trump began obsessing about it.”\n\nKirk, not Newsom, brought up the overall issue during their hour-plus conversation, which focused in part on how Democrats can rebuild a broader coalition of voters. Kirk pressed Newsom on whether he would speak out in opposition to transgender women athletes in competition.\n\nThe governor attempted to mitigate his comments, saying the discussion is about more than competitive advantage.\n\n“There’s also a humility and a grace that these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with, as well,” Newsom said. “So, both things I can hold in my hand. How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that I think is inherent in you but not always expressed on the issue and at the same time deal with the unfairness.”\n\nStill, Newsom’s approach marks a different political tack than he took on same-sex marriage more than two decades ago. As San Francisco mayor in 2004, Newsom drew national attention for the first time by directing the city clerk to begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses.\n\nThe move prompted legal action that led to a 2008 ruling from the California Supreme Court legalizing same-sex marriage in the nation’s largest state.

Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, used the inaugural episode of his new podcast to break from progressives by speaking out against allowing transgender women and girls to compete in female sports.\n\nNewsom made his declaration in an extended conversation with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old who built the influential Turning Point USA organization that helped President Donald Trump increase his support last fall among the youngest generation of voters. Kirk, like Trump, has been a vocal opponent of allowing transgender women and girls to participate.\n\n“I think it’s an issue of fairness, I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness — it’s deeply unfair,” Newsom told Kirk on “This is Gavin Newsom.”\n\n“I am not wrestling with the fairness issue,” continued Newsom, who played varsity baseball as a college student. “I totally agree with you. … I revere sports. So, the issue of fairness is completely legit.”\n\nThe governor’s comments are the latest in Democrats’ efforts to reconcile a 2024 election that returned Trump to the White House and gave Republicans control of both chambers of Congress. Among the disagreements since November is how much cultural issues – as opposed to economic policy and other matters – explain the party’s losses.\n\nOverall, polling suggests that allowing transgender female athletes to play on women’s teams isn’t broadly popular. Even most Democrats — around 7 in 10 — oppose allowing transgender female athletes to participate in women’s sports, according to a January New York Times/Ipsos poll. A 2023 Gallup poll also found that Democrats were divided on whether transgender people should be able to play on sports teams that match their current gender identity.\n\nNewsom, who has long positioned himself as a social progressive, drew sharp rebukes from LGBTQ advocates.\n\n“Sometimes Gavin Newsom goes for the Profile in Courage, sometimes not,” said California Assemblyman Chris Ward and state Sen. Carolina Menjivar, who lead the state’s LGBTQ legislative caucus. “We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks.”\n\nTony Hoang, executive director of Equality California, said he was “disappointed and angered” by Newsom’s statements and that they “added to the heartbreak and fear” the transgender community feels under the Trump administration.\n\n“Right now, transgender youth, their families, their doctors, and their teachers are facing unprecedented attacks from extremist politicians who want to eviscerate their civil rights and erase them from public life,” Hoang said. “They need leaders who will unequivocally fight for them.”\n\nCalifornia law, enacted before Newsom became governor, requires schools in the state to allow transgender athletes to play on school sports teams consistent with their gender identity.\n\nBeyond questions about athletics, there is less public support for broader restrictions on transgender rights and issues like medical care for transgender people, particularly among Democrats.\n\nAccording to AP VoteCast, 55% of voters in the 2024 election said support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far, while about 2 in 10 said it’s been about right and a similar share said it hasn’t gone far enough. Voters were also slightly more likely to oppose than favor laws that ban gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy, for minors who identify as transgender.\n\nBut Republicans have nonetheless sought to capitalize on the cultural touchstone that sports represent in America.\n\nTrump regularly hammered Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, Newsom’s fellow Californian, for supporting LGBTQ+ rights. Trump promised at his rallies to get “transgender insanity the hell out of our schools” and “keep men out of women’s sports.” His campaign also spent tens of millions of dollars on television and digital ads with the searing summation: “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”\n\n“Boy, did I see how you guys were able to weaponize it,” Newsom told Kirk, before yielding to Kirk’s protest and saying instead that the ads were an effective “highlight” during the campaign.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has threatened to withhold federal money from schools that allow transgender athletes to compete in women’s’ or girls’ events. He declared victory on the issue recently when the NCAA, which governs collegiate athletics in the U.S., changed its policy to restrict women’s sporting events to those athletes who were assigned the female gender at birth. Previously, the NCAA had a sport-by-sport policy determined by the respective sports’ national or international governing bodies.\n\nWard and Menjivar, the California lawmakers, said playing on a team consistent with one’s gender hasn’t been a problem “until Donald Trump began obsessing about it.”\n\nKirk, not Newsom, brought up the overall issue during their hour-plus conversation, which focused in part on how Democrats can rebuild a broader coalition of voters. Kirk pressed Newsom on whether he would speak out in opposition to transgender women athletes in competition.\n\nThe governor attempted to mitigate his comments, saying the discussion is about more than competitive advantage.\n\n“There’s also a humility and a grace that these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with, as well,” Newsom said. “So, both things I can hold in my hand. How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that I think is inherent in you but not always expressed on the issue and at the same time deal with the unfairness.”\n\nStill, Newsom’s approach marks a different political tack than he took on same-sex marriage more than two decades ago. As San Francisco mayor in 2004, Newsom drew national attention for the first time by directing the city clerk to begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses.\n\nThe move prompted legal action that led to a 2008 ruling from the California Supreme Court legalizing same-sex marriage in the nation’s largest state. That decision came seven years before the U.S. Supreme Court established same-sex marriage as a national right.\n\nBarrow reported from Atlanta.

U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who’s overseeing the litigation, was nominated to his position by Trump in 2017 and has been a member of the Federalist Society since 2012. In his five years on the bench, he’s issued rulings to block Biden-era rules regarding immigration, health care and discrimination. He’s the only judge in the Amarillo division of the court, making it a near certainty that he’s assigned cases filed at that location.\n\n “This lawsuit is an affront to the First Amendment and is without basis in law or fact,” writes Thomas Riney, a lawyer for CBS, in the filing. Trump seeks to “punish a news organization for constitutionally protected editorial judgments they do not like.”\n\n Last month, Trump revised his lawsuit to add Republican U.S. Rep. Ronny Jackson, his former doctor who lives in Texas, as a plaintiff to keep the case in Texas federal court. The case revolves around allegations that CBS News aired a “heavily tampered interview” with former Vice President Kamala Harris to help her in the election by editing certain answers in a way that misled consumers. This manipulation of the interview, Trump alleged, constitutes a violation of Texas’ consumer protection law covering deceptive advertising and the unfair competition prong of the Lanham Act, a trademark law.\n\n In Thursday’s filing, CBS argues that the inclusion of Jackson in the lawsuit is a “vain effort to manufacture a connection to this District.” It stresses that Jackson has spent the majority of the last decade based in Washington, D.C. and that the complaint doesn’t sufficiently allege that he watched or suffered an injury from the 60 Minutes segment at the center of the legal battle in the state.\n\n CBS also says that the lawsuit doesn’t belong in Texas because the 60 Minutes segment, which was focused on the national presidential election, didn’t target Texans more than residents of other states.\n\n “The interview of Vice President Kamala Harris, excerpts of which aired on Face the Nation and 60 Minutes, was not filmed, edited, or produced in Texas, nor was Texas in any way the subject of the interview,” the filing states. “If this district has personal jurisdiction merely because CBS programs are broadcast nationwide, so too does every district court in the country. That is not the law.”\n\n If the lawsuit isn’t dismissed, CBS claims that it should be moved to federal court in New York.\n\n Paramount declined to comment.","summary":"\"This lawsuit is an affront to the First Amendment and is without basis in law or fact,\" writes Thomas Riney, a lawyer for CBS, in the filing.","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/paramount-trump-lawsuit-60-minutes-1236156779/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image001.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-06 20:36:14","author":"Erik Hayden,Winston Cho","authors":["Erik Hayden","Winston Cho"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.189},{"id":297509392,"title":"Commentary: Trump promised lower food prices immediately, but I gave him six weeks. Here's my grocery bill","text":"On Jan.19, the last day of the Joe Biden presidency, I went to my neighborhood supermarket and priced 28 items, including milk, eggs, bacon and potatoes. Six weeks into the second Donald Trump presidency, I went back to the same store and priced the same items. Why? Because during the last presidential election, voters repeatedly complained about the economy and singled out the high cost of groceries. With good reason. Inflation is a killer, and anybody who’s gone shopping in recent years is well aware that in a supermarket, your money doesn’t go as far as it once did. Breakfast, lunch and dinner all cost more than they used to. Trump smartly hammered away at that reality as a candidate. “A vote for Trump means your groceries will be cheaper,” he said on the campaign trail. And how long did he say it would take to turn things around? “When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on Day 1,” Trump promised. You didn’t need a doctorate in economics to know that was unlikely to happen. Markets are more complicated than that, and prices can swing on multiple factors beyond the control of an elected official. But it wasn’t uncommon to hear voters cite the price of groceries as a pivotal issue for them, and among those who said inflation in general was the most important issue, two-thirds voted for Trump, according to one survey. Trump began backpedaling as soon as he won the election. He said in December that he still believed that solving supply chain issues and drilling on American soil, to bring down energy costs, would lower food prices. But he yanked his Day 1 promise and pointed a finger, saying Biden had driven prices sky high, and, “It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up… It’s very hard.” If you’re feeling a sense of deja vu, it might be because after promising in his first term to immediately deliver cheaper and better healthcare for everyone — a vow Trump ultimately struck out on despite Republican control of Congress — he said, “Nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated.” On grocery prices, Trump’s take was about as simplistic as that of Democratic opponent Kamala Harris, who promised to crack down on price gouging. Generally speaking, supermarkets operate on slim profit margins, and pricing is a byzantine calculus, says U.C. Davis professor Daniel A. Sumner, who served on President Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisers and in the U.S. Department of Agriculture under President George H.W. Bush. If stores are forced to raise egg prices because of wholesale costs, Sumner said, they might reduce the price of other items on the theory that shoppers have only so much money to spend. If stores keep eggs priced at $5 a dozen even when that means taking a loss, they’re likely to raise prices on other items to make up the difference. As much as possible, though, they like to keep prices fixed on most items. “The best thing to do is raise consumer incomes,” Sumner said, because the problem “is not food prices, it’s food prices relative to people’s incomes.” I’m willing to concede that despite Trump’s blown promise of lower prices on Day 1, it’s possible some of his policies might have a role in lowering prices in coming months and years. Or raising them. So I’ll check back periodically. Michigan State professor David L. Ortega, a food economist, said a U.S. president has little direct control over grocery prices, “especially in the short term.” “The reason there’s been such a sharp rise over the past four years is that a convergence of factors impacted supply and demand, including COVID, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, significant drought, and bird flu outbreaks,” Ortega said, adding that climate change has also had a significant impact on food production. One way a president can influence prices is to create more stability, Ortega said. But the opposite is happening, with Trump rolling out tariffs, deportations and cuts to federal agencies that monitor food safety and the spread of viruses. “Even the threat of some of these policies” can be inflationary, Ortega said, “because companies are scrambling, trying to come up with contingency plans for where they might source produces or find labor.” Now let’s get back to my shopping spree at a Vons in Eagle Rock. On the campaign trail last August, Trump used groceries as props to make his point about inflation. The items included Cheerios, Land O'Lakes butter, Gold Medal flour, eggs, bacon, bagels, bread, sausage and fruit. I priced many of those products, and a lot of others. My list included Thomas’ bagels, Dave’s 21-grain bread, Farmer John bacon, Breyers ice cream, Campbell’s chicken soup, Mott’s apple juice, Triscuits, Cheez-Itz, Oreo cookies, Gold Medal flour, C&H sugar, Skippy peanut butter, Classico pasta sauce, Barilla pasta, Lucerne milk, Lay’s potato chips, Lucerne cheddar cheese, Ben’s rice, navel oranges, bananas, iceberg lettuce, and russet potatoes. Of the 28 items, 24 were the same price, to the penny, on Jan. 19 and March 3. (And by the way, on each visit, I recorded the regular prices rather than the discounted member prices, because the latter did not apply to every item and not everyone is a member). Four items had different prices. The Thomas’ bagels, six to a bag, went from $5.79 to $5.89. A dozen Lucerne Grade AA large eggs went from $7.49 to $9.99. An 8.9-ounce box of Cheerios went from $5.99 to $5.29. And navel oranges went from $1.29 a pound to $.99. The total tab when Biden was president – $146.03. The Trump total – $147.63.

Gavin Newsom of California, embarking on a personal post-mortem of the failures of his Democratic Party, suggested this week that the participation of transgender athletes in women's sports was \"deeply unfair.\"\n\nThe comments by Newsom, who has backed LGBTQ+ causes for decades and was one of the first American elected officials to officiate same-sex weddings, represented a remarkable break from other top Democrats on the issue and signaled a newly defensive position on transgender rights among many in his party.\n\nJust as surprising as Newsom's remarks was the person to whom he made them: Charlie Kirk, 31, a right-wing influencer best known for starting Turning Point USA, the pro-Trump organization that is active on college campuses.\n\nNewsom invited Kirk, who has a long history of inflammatory and conspiratorial remarks, onto the debut episode of his new podcast, \"This Is Gavin Newsom,\" for an 81-minute discussion. The governor, who has long been fascinated with the conservative media ecosystem and tried to inject himself into it, explained his unlikely guest by saying, \"People need to understand your success, your influence, what you've been up to.\"\n\nNewsom is widely seen as having presidential ambitions in 2028 -- something he joked about on the podcast. For years, he was one of the fiercest Democratic antagonists toward President Donald Trump, casting himself as a next-generation liberal warrior fluent in conservative orthodoxy who could lead his party into the post-Biden era.\n\nBut in recent months, he has softened his tone toward Trump and attacked Democrats over their strategy. In December, Newsom cursed the president-elect's name in an interview with The New York Times, but shortly after the inauguration, the governor traveled to Washington for a meeting with Trump to discuss funding for wildfire relief.\n\nNewsom spent much of his conversation with Kirk reflecting on the myriad ways that former Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign failed to reach key voters during the 2024 election, losing ground with young people, men and Hispanic voters.\n\nBut his most significant revelation on his podcast, which was released Thursday morning, came when Kirk pressed the California governor to agree with him that it was unfair for transgender women to compete in women's sports.\n\n\"I think it's an issue of fairness; I completely agree with you on that,\" Newsom said. \"It is an issue of fairness. It's deeply unfair.\"\n\nHe also acknowledged the effectiveness of Trump's signature campaign ad, which declared, \"Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\"\n\n\"It was devastating,\" Newsom said. \"And she didn't even react to it, which was even more devastating.\"\n\nSince Democrats' election loss last year, Newsom has become the most prominent official in the party to lament its position on transgender participation in sports, but he is hardly the first. Hours after the presidential race was called, Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., told the Times that he did not want his young daughters \"getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete,\" a remark that set off weeks of blowback.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has taken steps to try to erase transgender people from American life. He has eliminated the T -- for transgender -- from federal LGBTQ+ policies online and moved to ban transgender people from serving in the military.\n\nTrump also signed an executive order meant to prohibit transgender women and girls from competing in women's sports, directing federal agencies to withhold funding from schools if they did not comply. A day later, the NCAA instituted such a ban. More than two dozen states now bar transgender athletes from school sports, whether in K-12 schools or at colleges.\n\nDemocrats have shown increased caution on the issue, but many have tried to push back. On Monday, the party's senators blocked a Republican bill that closely resembled Trump's executive order, arguing that the GOP was seeking political gain by targeting a small, vulnerable group of children.\n\nScott Wiener, a Democratic state senator from San Francisco who is openly gay, said it was deeply disappointing to hear Newsom \"align\" with Republicans on the issue.\n\n\"It was a gut punch from any Democratic leader, and particularly from Gov. Newsom, because he has been such a staunch ally for the LGBTQ community,\" Wiener said.\n\nKelley Robinson, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBTQ+ advocacy group, said Newsom's comments were misguided and politically inept.\n\n\"The fight for equality has never been easy, but history doesn't remember those who waver; it remembers those who refuse to back down,\" Robinson said. \"Our message to Gov. Newsom and all leaders across the country is simple: The path to 2028 isn't paved with the betrayal of vulnerable communities.\"\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nOn his podcast, Newsom spoke at length about the political effectiveness of attacking transgender people in the presidential campaign. He called Trump's \"they/them\" commercial \"a great ad.\" He also questioned the practice of people announcing their preferred pronouns when introducing themselves.\n\n\"I had one meeting where people started going around the table with the pronouns,\" Newsom said. \"I'm like, 'What the hell? Why is this the biggest issue?'\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nAt the beginning of Newsom's political career, after he was elected mayor of San Francisco in 2003, he officiated at same-sex weddings before they were allowed by law. He routinely participated in the city's famed Pride parade and for decades has supported expanding rights for LGBTQ+ people.\n\nHe is also the godfather to Nats Getty, a designer and oil heir who came out as transgender in 2021 and is married to Gigi Gorgeous, a transgender YouTube personality. The governor delivered a video toast at the couple's wedding in 2019.\n\nLast year, as school boards in conservative regions of California passed policies to require educators to notify parents if a child went by a different gender identity at school, Newsom signed a state law prohibiting such rules.\n\nLGBTQ+ advocates welcomed the law, while conservatives said it infringed on parents' rights. Elon Musk cited the law as a reason to move the headquarters of his company SpaceX to Texas from California.\n\nNewsom has also tried to show that he wants to talk with Republicans and is willing to tangle with them. He has kept up a regular line of communication with Sean Hannity, the conservative Fox News host; he debated Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, on live television in 2023; and he has long maintained private social media accounts curated to show him pro-Trump content.\n\nSo it was little surprise that Newsom expressed familiarity with the issues that most animated Kirk, who is himself a prominent podcaster and TikTok influencer. Newsom spent much of the discussion agreeing with Kirk on issues that have long been anathema to Democratic voters, seemingly working out in real time why Democrats lost ground to Republicans last year.\n\nAs to what the party should do next, Newsom blasted prominent Democrats -- notably, strategist James Carville -- who have suggested that the party allow Trump to become unpopular on his own and wait to offer a competing alternative.\n\n\"I'm thinking about, 'We're going to stand back and watch you run circles around us for six months, the next two or three years, waiting for the moment to finally strike,'\" Newsom said. \"Struck me as not necessarily the best advice.\"\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nNewsom also called his visit during the coronavirus pandemic to the French Laundry, one of the country's most expensive restaurants, the \"dumbest bonehead move of my life,\" adding, \"Own it, move on, grow up.\" That outing, which infuriated Californians who were living under rules discouraging gatherings, helped prompt a recall election in 2021 in which Newsom prevailed.\n\nThe governor also said that the only time he thought Joe Biden had experienced any \"mental decline\" during his aborted 2024 campaign was during a Hollywood fundraiser that preceded his disastrous debate performance. Several allies of Biden, including actor George Clooney, said later that the fundraiser had made them newly worried about the president's vigor.\n\n\"I saw a different person,\" Newsom said. \"That was the one time.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"WASHINGTON -- Gov.

During his joint address to Congress Tuesday evening, Trump announced that Sharifullah, who was allegedly involved in planning the bombing, was arrested by his administration.\n\nOn “Jesse Watters Primetime,” Gorka, who had been with the team at the time of Sharifullah’s arrest, was asked by Fox’s Jesse Watters to describe the takedown, specifically what led to nabbing the suspected terrorist.\n\n“We just unleashed the hounds of hell,” Gorka said. “I came into office to run counterterrorism for Mike Waltz, the former Green Beret National Security Advisor to President Trump. In my first two weeks, I’d been told by the intelligence community, our special operators, that they’ve been surveilling bad guys, jihadis across the planet for four years, and the Biden administration just didn’t care. We said, ‘Well, we told the president, and he said, find them and kill them.’”\n\nGorka said he told the CIA, NSA and FBI that they need to find Sharifullah for Trump and the families affected, whether that be killing him or bringing him “to U.S. soil to face justice.”\n\n“The NSA especially, we salute, you know who you are … The NSA team that found a certain piece of intelligence. We provided it to the government of Pakistan,” Gorka said as he thanked that country for taking the suspected terrorist down and arresting him.\n\n“Then our brave flight team members from the FBI went to Islamabad on Saturday. They interviewed Sharifullah, and he confessed not just to Abbey Gate, but to numerous other ISIS mass murders. We were there on the tarmac with Kash [Patel], Pam [Bondi], Tulsi [Gabbard], John [Radcliffe], with my counterterrorism team and about 100 other agents. It was like a movie. President Trump made the promises to the Abbey Gate 13 families. Last night at 3 a.m. at Dulles Airport, President Trump kept that promise.”\n\nA Pakistani intelligence official familiar with the operation told ABC News that Pakistani special forces had recently captured Sharifullah on the Pakistani-Afghan border and extradited him to the U.S. by Tuesday evening.\n\nWatters went on to ask Gorka what he said to the suspected terrorist as he met him face-to face Tuesday evening. Gorka described seeing the “pits of hell” in Sharifullah’s eyes.\n\n“I just looked him in the eyes, and I looked into his eyes. I saw the pits of hell. I saw darkness in that man’s eyes, the likes of which I’d never seen before. I just felt good for the families,” Gorka said. “President Trump spoke to those families privately before the joint session from the White House. I was there with National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.”\n\n“We gave them just a little bit, a little bit of closure for their loved ones when we brought that walking piece of human filth evil to justice last night,” Gorka added. “I salute everyone, the FBI, the agents of CBP, the marshals, the pilots. God bless what you did for America. This is why elections matter, Jesse, because of that man being in a supermax and paying a penalty for the murder of American war fighters.”\n\nDuring both former President Joe Biden’s and former Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign for the 2024 presidency, the two leaders were heavily criticized for their handling of Abbey Gate, particularly regarding the families of the slain service members. In a September 2024 interview with Fox News, two fathers of the Gold Star service members called out Harris and Biden for “gaslighting” families and ignoring them over the past three years since the incident.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, used the inaugural episode of his new podcast to break from progressives by speaking out against allowing transgender women and girls to compete in female sports.\n\nNewsom made his declaration in an extended conversation with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old who built the influential Turning Point USA organization that helped President Donald Trump increase his support last fall among the youngest generation of voters. Kirk, like Trump, has been a vocal opponent of allowing transgender women and girls to participate.\n\nThe governor’s comments come just months after the women’s volleyball team at San Jose State University found itself at the center of a firestorm.\n\n“I think it’s an issue of fairness, I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness — it’s deeply unfair,” Newsom told Kirk on “This is Gavin Newsom.”\n\n“I am not wrestling with the fairness issue,” continued Newsom, who played varsity baseball as a college student. “I totally agree with you. … I revere sports. So, the issue of fairness is completely legit.”\n\nThe governor’s comments are the latest in Democrats’ efforts to reconcile a 2024 election that returned Trump to the White House and gave Republicans control of both chambers of Congress. Among the disagreements since November is how much cultural issues – as opposed to economic policy and other matters – explain the party’s losses.\n\nOverall, polling suggests that allowing transgender female athletes to play on women’s teams isn’t broadly popular. Even most Democrats — around 7 in 10 — oppose allowing transgender female athletes to participate in women’s sports, according to a January New York Times/Ipsos poll. A 2023 Gallup poll also found that Democrats were divided on whether transgender people should be able to play on sports teams that match their current gender identity.\n\nNewsom, who has long positioned himself as a social progressive, drew sharp rebukes from LGBTQ advocates.\n\n“Sometimes Gavin Newsom goes for the Profile in Courage, sometimes not,” said California Assemblyman Chris Ward and state Sen. Carolina Menjivar, who lead the state’s LGBTQ legislative caucus. “We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks.”\n\nTony Hoang, executive director of Equality California, said he was “disappointed and angered” by Newsom’s statements and that they “added to the heartbreak and fear” the transgender community feels under the Trump administration.\n\n“Right now, transgender youth, their families, their doctors, and their teachers are facing unprecedented attacks from extremist politicians who want to eviscerate their civil rights and erase them from public life,” Hoang said. “They need leaders who will unequivocally fight for them.”\n\nCalifornia law, enacted before Newsom became governor, requires schools in the state to allow transgender athletes to play on school sports teams consistent with their gender identity.\n\nBeyond questions about athletics, there is less public support for broader restrictions on transgender rights and issues like medical care for transgender people, particularly among Democrats.\n\nAccording to AP VoteCast, 55% of voters in the 2024 election said support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far, while about 2 in 10 said it’s been about right and a similar share said it hasn’t gone far enough. Voters were also slightly more likely to oppose than favor laws that ban gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy, for minors who identify as transgender.\n\nBut Republicans have nonetheless sought to capitalize on the cultural touchstone that sports represent in America.\n\nTrump regularly hammered Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, Newsom’s fellow Californian, for supporting LGBTQ+ rights. Trump promised at his rallies to get “transgender insanity the hell out of our schools” and “keep men out of women’s sports.” His campaign also spent tens of millions of dollars on television and digital ads with the searing summation: “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”\n\n“Boy, did I see how you guys were able to weaponize it,” Newsom told Kirk, before yielding to Kirk’s protest and saying instead that the ads were an effective “highlight” during the campaign.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has threatened to withhold federal money from schools that allow transgender athletes to compete in women’s’ or girls’ events. He declared victory on the issue recently when the NCAA, which governs collegiate athletics in the U.S., changed its policy to restrict women’s sporting events to those athletes who were assigned the female gender at birth. Previously, the NCAA had a sport-by-sport policy determined by the respective sports’ national or international governing bodies.\n\nWard and Menjivar, the California lawmakers, said playing on a team consistent with one’s gender hasn’t been a problem “until Donald Trump began obsessing about it.”\n\nKirk, not Newsom, brought up the overall issue during their hour-plus conversation, which focused in part on how Democrats can rebuild a broader coalition of voters. Kirk pressed Newsom on whether he would speak out in opposition to transgender women athletes in competition.\n\nThe governor attempted to mitigate his comments, saying the discussion is about more than competitive advantage.\n\n“There’s also a humility and a grace that these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with, as well,” Newsom said. “So, both things I can hold in my hand.

Dodging traditional interviews with mainstream outlets, Trump opted to appear on podcasts hosted by influencers, like Theo Von and Joe Rogan, to appeal to young male voters in 2024. The media gamble paid off, helping Trump shift young white and Latino men to the right by 22 points and 38 points respectively.Newsom's podcast also doubles as a notable pivot from the long-held Democratic strategy of ignoring voices in conservative media. Kirk's Thursday appearance marks the first of what Newsom has teased as a string of interviews with influential MAGA figures.Who Is Charlie Kirk?Kirk, a popular conservative influencer, co-founded Turning Point USA in 2012 at the age of 18. He has 6.1 million followers on TikTok, 5 million followers on Instagram and 4.7 million followers on X, formerly Twitter.On Thursday's episode, the 31-year-old Kirk described himself as having always been conservative. He said as he started to grow his organization, he noticed an \"ideological imbalances\" on a lot of college campuses. After aligning TPUSA to Trump's brand of populist conservatism in 2016, Kirk began ramping up the organization's presence at universities, often debating students on culture-war issues. Many of those debates have gone viral online.Kirk quickly became part of Trump's youth outreach, offering a fresh face for the MAGA movement. He became a frequent guess on Fox News, Newsmax and conservative radio shows. Kirk recalled that in 2021, TPUSA had a goal of moving young Americans to the right by 10 points in 10 years.\"We did it in four years, not 10, thanks to you guys,\" Kirk told Newsom.Newsom acknowledged Kirk's massive influence on Thursday, telling Kirk that his 13-year-old son wanted to skip school to see his dad's interview and that his college-aged niece, who is enrolled at the University of Southern California, told him how big of a crowd Kirk drew when he visited the school.\"The point, which is, you're making a damn dent,\" the governor said.What Did Gavin Newsom Say About Trans Athletes?Newsom, who has a long history of pioneering rights of LBTQ+ people in California, suggested that Democrats were wrong in allowing transgender athletes to participate in women's and girls sports.\"I think it's an issue of fairness, I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness — it's deeply unfair,\" Newsom said. \"I am not wrestling with the fairness issue. I totally agree with you.\"Adding that his wife and daughter play sports, he said, \"I revere sports, so the issue of fairness is completely legit.\"Newsom said over the last couple of years, he saw how Republicans have been able to highlight the issue of fairness.\"That's easy to call out, the issue of that,\" he said. \"There's also a humility and grace that these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well.\"\"Both things I can hold in my hand, how do we address this issues with the kind of decency that's, you know, inherent with you but not always expressed on the issue, while at the same time, deal with the unfairness?\" Newsom asked his guest.He told Kirk he agreed with him that the majority of Americans strongly favor laws that require trans athletes to participate on teams that match their biological sex, saying Democrats we're getting \"crushed\" by the issue. Various polls have shown as much as 80 percent of Americans agree that transgender females should not be allowed to play in girls' sports.The governor also called Trump's campaign ad targeting former Vice President Kamala Harris' support for gender-affirming care a \"brilliant campaign commercial\" that had \"devastating\" and \"brutal\" impacts on Harris' campaign. In the ad, Trump's campaign argued that he was for \"you,\" while Harris was for \"they/them.\" Newsom added that he's only been at one meeting where participants went around and stated their pronouns.\"It was a great ad and I don't say that lightly,\" Newsom said.Newsom Says Democrats Should Welcome Anti-Abortion voicesOn the podcast, Kirk argued that unlike the GOP, which has \"immense and vocal and public spats all the time,\" the Democratic Party was too fixated on an \"unhealthy purification process.\"\"We fight about foreign policy — Look at Ukraine, right? We're talking about primary challenging some of these senators that were meeting Zelensky last week,\" Kirk said. \"The Democrat Party would never do that. I think that's a symptom of an underlying thing.\"Speaking about how Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard, two former Democrats who now sit in Trump's Cabinet, found themselves cast out of the party, Kirk said, \"You guys see how you have an unhealthy purification process, where eventually you're just left with just a 31 percent approval rating.\"\"If Democrats are serious about being a majority party ever again, when somebody has a disagreement — for example, if there's a pro-life Democrat, is there a place for a pro-life Democrat in the Democrat Party?\" Kirk asked the governor.\"There should be,\" Newsom responded. \"On principle, there should be. Absolutely. That's a deeply-held personal point of view, god bless. And I say this as one of the biggest champions for reproductive freedoms on the planet.\"How Donald Trump Won Young Americas, According to KirkKirk argued on Thursday that Trump has become such a large cultural phenomenon because he was able to become a \"figure of an American comeback story\" that resonated with a lot of young people who were feeling discouraged by the state of the country.\"It's the first time in America's history that a 30-year-old is going to have it worse off than their parents. It's a breakdown of the social [compact],\" Kirk said.\"The message that was largely being fed to a lot of young people was 'Lower your expectations. You're not going to have the same American Dream that your parents would have,'\" he said. \"And we saw this as an opportunity, especially with young men.\"Kirk went on to argue that Trump, by virtue of his ability to fight back against the lawsuits and criminal cases against him, the mainstream media and two assassination attempts, \"personified what a lot of young people, especially a lot of young men, wanted back in their politics, which was an ascendant, rebel attitude against these institutions that have failed them so miserably.\"Kirk on Why Democrats Can't Replicate MAGA's Podcast StrategyWhile Kirk credited Democrats with having a better organizing and get-out-the-vote effort, he said Republicans still had the better message. The influencer applauded Newsom for embracing longform podcasts, but argued that Democrats could not survive in such environment.\"It's too unscripted, it's too masculine, honestly,\" Kirk said.When Newsom challenged him on what that meant, Kirk replied, \"To go into the wilderness with no rules and duel it out and see who is better and stronger.\"\"If you want to earn the respect of forgotten America, you have to show them you can intellectually joust with no script, no hard breaks, no producers in the ears, no teleprompters, that's where new media is going,\" Kirk said.Newsom chuckled as he responded, \"Love that.\"\"What Democrats are doing is you're still playing in a very old, hyper-sanitized media environment, and my advice is, you've got to go where it's unpredictable, where it's treacherous, where it's dangerous,\" Kirk told Newsom.\"It's by no coincidence that out of the longform podcasting genres, the top 10, 8 of them are conservative or center-right, Rogan, Megyn Kelly, Theo Von, the Paul brothers, our program, Ben Shapiro, Matt Walsh,\" Kirk said. \"There's a singular one on the left, which is Pod Save America, which is just like a bunch of Obama bros agreeing with each other for 90 minutes and saying, 'We're not very smart.'\"'This is Gavin Newsom' Podcast: How to ListenNewsom's podcast, \"This is Gavin Newsom\" is available on iHeart Radio, Spotify, Apple, Pandora and Amazon. Episode clips and updates are also available on the governor's social media pages.\"Governor Newsom is going solo and diving into the real issues that matter—government, politics, affordability, quality of life, and the cultural moments shaping our world. No spin, no script, just real talk about what impacts listeners most.

She’s a thorough judge.”\n\nStill, the ruling gives the plaintiffs time to build their case that Project Rise Partners, and perhaps other suitors, should be able to present competing proposals to the Paramount Special Committee.\n\nThe plaintiffs now also can subpoena a whistleblower as well as minutes of meetings held by the Paramount Special Committee that is conducting negotiations.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Communications Commission is investigating allegations of political bias at Paramount’s CBS News over a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nCharles Gasparino reported exclusively last week that the FCC’s decision could drag out until the summer.\n\nSeparately, President Trump has entered mediation talks with Paramount about settling his $20 billion suit alleging media bias during the election. The result of those mediation talks could impact the FCC, sources said.\n\nJudge McCormick would likely need to be comfortable that there was a credible alternative bid before actually blocking the $8 billion Skydance-Paramount merger.\n\nEarly last month, New York City’s public pension funds sued to block the Skydance merger agreement, whose exclusive terms have prevented Paramount from considering any rival bid including consortium Project Rise’s higher $8.8 billion offer. \n\nThe Paramount board allegedly did not seriously consider Project Rise’s bid during the auction process, the suit says.\n\n“The plaintiffs made zero effort at the hearing to defend the credibility of Project Rise. Not a word about it,” a source close to the case said.\n\nThe New York City pensions allege Skydance is buying media heiress Shari Redstone’s controlling stake in Paramount at a much higher premium than it is paying common stockholders and that common shareholders were left out of the process without a vote.\n\nJudge McCormick last year famously smacked down Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay package from Tesla’s board.","summary":"A Delaware judge ruled that Paramount Global's $8 billion merger with Skydance Media can move forward -- but still left the door open for a last-minute, rival bid.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/06/business/door-open-for-rival-bid-to-disrupt-8b-paramount-skydance-merger-after-judges-ruling/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/99878825.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-06 19:44:07","author":"Alexandra Steigrad,Josh Kosman","authors":["Alexandra Steigrad","Josh Kosman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":297482198,"title":"GOP will 'hand gavel back to Schumer' after poll shows bad news for NC senator: Trump adviser","text":"One of the U.S. Senate races that will be closely watched in the 2026 midterms in the one in North Carolina, where conservative GOP Sen.

University presidents fearing that millions of dollars in federal funding could disappear are holding their fire. CEOs alarmed by tariffs that could hurt their businesses are on mute.\n\nEven longtime Republican hawks on Capitol Hill, stunned by President Donald Trump's revisionist history that Ukraine is to blame for its invasion by Russia, and his Oval Office blowup at President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have either muzzled themselves, tiptoed up to criticism without naming Trump or completely reversed their positions.\n\nMore than six weeks into the second Trump administration, there is a chill spreading over political debate in Washington and beyond.\n\nPeople on both sides of the aisle who would normally be part of the public dialogue about the big issues of the day say they are intimidated by the prospect of online attacks from Trump and Elon Musk, concerned about harm to their companies and frightened for the safety of their families. Politicians fear banishment by a party remade in Trump's image and the prospect of primary opponents financed by Musk, the president's all-powerful partner and the world's richest man.\n\n\"When you see important societal actors -- be it university presidents, media outlets, CEOs, mayors, governors -- changing their behavior in order to avoid the wrath of the government, that's a sign that we've crossed the line into some form of authoritarianism,\" said Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard University and the co-author of the influential 2018 book \"How Democracies Die.\"\n\nTrump campaigned in 2024 promising retribution against his enemies and has quickly sent menacing signals from the White House. He revoked the security details of high-profile critics like Gen. Mark Milley, a retired Joint Chiefs of Staff chair who faces death threats from Iran, and said he would pull the security clearances of lawyers at a prominent law firm who are representing Jack Smith, the special counsel who investigated him.\n\nOne prominent first-term critic of Trump said in a recent interview that not only would he not comment on the record; he did not want to be mentioned in this article at all. Every time his name appears in public, he said, the threats against him from the far right increase.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., was wavering in his support for Pete Hegseth, Trump's nominee for defense secretary, until the president threatened him with a primary and Tillis did a turnabout. (Tillis' office said the senator was simply performing careful vetting.)\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., told Zelenskyy in a meeting at the Hay-Adams Hotel last week that he was there with other senators \"as a show of support.\" But after Trump's confrontation with Zelenskyy later that day, Wicker took down a social media post showing him shaking hands with the Ukrainian leader.\n\nMore than a half-dozen Republican defense hawks in the Senate -- not a group usually shy about communicating its views -- declined to comment for this article or did not respond to requests for comment about Trump's statements on Ukraine or why other Republicans were not speaking out.\n\nMost elected Republicans are fully supportive of Trump and his agenda, and on issues like immigration, some Democrats are moving in his direction, reflecting public opinion. Democrats were divided over the wisdom of the protest by Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, during Trump's address to Congress on Tuesday night.\n\nBut the lack of aggressive pushback from targets of Trump's retribution and policy agenda is striking, if understandable in other cases.\n\nUniversity presidents are largely silent because they are protecting their institutions, said Ted Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education. \"Don't wrestle with a pig,\" he said. \"You'll just get muddy and annoy the pig.\"\n\nBusiness leaders rarely criticize presidents of either party, and in any case, they like Trump's plans for tax cuts and deregulation, if not his tariffs. They also recognize, one of them said, that \"periodically culling the workforce is actually good for a healthy organization.\"\n\nBut that business leader thinks that CEOs see the way that Musk is going about slashing the federal workforce as \"totally crazy\" -- but would say so only on the condition of anonymity, fearing retribution.\n\nPressure on Intellectual Life\n\nNot everyone is staying silent. Consider Michael Roth, the president of Wesleyan University.\n\n\"This is the greatest pressure put on intellectual life since the McCarthy era,\" Roth said in an interview. \"And I think it'll be seen in the future, as that time was seen, as a time when people either stood up for their values or ran in fear of the federal government.\"\n\nRoth has called some of the Trump administration's rhetoric authoritarian and has spoken out in favor of diversity, equity and inclusion programs. In an interview in The Washington Post's opinion section last month, he criticized Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida for using their Ivy League degrees to advance professionally while portraying themselves as populists against \"woke\" universities.\n\nPeople sometimes tell him he has courage, Roth said, but he insisted it wasn't so. \"When people tell me, 'Oh, you're brave,' it frightens the hell out of me,\" he said. \"I'm a little neurotic Jewish kid from Long Island. I'm afraid of everything.\"\n\nRoth is going public, he said, \"because it's a scandal that the federal government is trying to keep people from speaking their minds.\"\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. and a frequent critic of Trump, said the real fear among Republicans in the House who might otherwise voice criticism of the administration on some issues was violence against their families.\n\n\"I'm friends with a lot of these guys, and I had wrongly assumed that what was holding them back from speaking out against Trump was they were afraid of losing their jobs,\" he said in an interview. \"But what they're afraid of is their own personal security. They tell me that their wives tell them, 'Don't contribute to us getting harassed at church or at the grocery store or at the club.'\"\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nSwalwell, who receives plenty of threats himself, said that he spends hundreds of thousands of dollars of his campaign and office funds on security for his own family, and that his daughter recently included a member of his security detail in a drawing of her family for her kindergarten class.\n\nSen. Todd Young of Indiana is one Republican who has experienced browbeating from Musk for not staying in line. After Young asked tough questions last month at the confirmation hearing of Tulsi Gabbard, now Trump's director of national intelligence, Musk said on social media that Young was a \"deep state puppet.\"\n\nMusk soon deleted his post and said he had spoken to Young, whom he was suddenly calling \"a great ally in restoring power to the people.\" Young went on to confirm Gabbard, although in an interview last week, he pointedly said he had not discussed her with Musk.\n\n\"I don't think anyone should be afraid to register their convictions,\" he said. \"OK?\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who is friendly with a broad group of Senate Republicans, said in an interview that \"those who I have traveled with and worked with and prayed with and been involved with in foreign aid and foreign policy are struck by the swiftness, the forcefulness, the cruelty and the lack of organization of the cuts.\"\n\nWhy do they not speak out? Musk, he said, has issued \"a credible electoral threat\" to finance primary opponents.\n\nAnd yet, senators only face reelection every six years. \"Frankly,\" Coons said, \"it is a combination of hoping that things change and somehow this all comes apart and the chain-saw approach to government stops.\"\n\n'Totally Reasonable to Be Worried'\n\nMarc Elias, a prominent Democratic lawyer who oversaw the Biden campaign's successful efforts to beat back lawsuits filed by allies of Trump seeking to overturn his 2020 election loss, is sharply critical of Republicans who say they acquiesce to Trump out of fear.\n\n\"I know what it's like to be targeted by him and the mob he unleashes,\" Elias said in an interview. \"It is totally reasonable to be worried. But for a Republican senator to say they are so worried that they're going to betray their oath of office is such cowardice. Why are you in office?\"\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nOther Republicans see the warnings of authoritarianism as overblown.\n\n\"I'm becoming less and less sympathetic,\" said former Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for his role in egging on the Jan. 6, 2021, mob at the Capitol. \"The rending of cloth and the gnashing of teeth, good lord.\"\n\nAfter the anti-Israel protests against the war in Gaza on college campuses, Meijer said, \"there's a lot more that the fringes on either side share with each other.\"\n\nThat is the perspective of Mark Cuban, the billionaire entrepreneur who supported Kamala Harris for president in 2024 and who spoke recently in Washington at the Principles First summit, an annual anti-Trump gathering. The Republicans, he said, saw \"all the identity politics and all the wokeness\" on the left \"as the real silencing factor.\"\n\nCuban added that \"now that Trump has won, there isn't value in calling him names. Name-calling is good for running for office, sometimes. Good for trying to get people excited at a rally. But neither fit me.\"\n\nOlivia Troye, a first-term Trump White House official who broke with him and spoke at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, said that the \"Never Trump\" movement had splintered and that it was difficult for her to watch what was happening.\n\n\"We're in a moment when there's self-preservation, and I don't blame people for that,\" she said. \"But we need to remind ourselves that we have the power. The only reason that they have the power and are continuing to do what they do is that people are going silent.\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nAs Trump has continued his aggressive effort to reshape the government, there are some signs that more people are speaking out.\n\nIn a letter to lawmakers last week, five former defense secretaries who served under Republicans and Democrats -- Lloyd Austin, Jim Mattis, Leon E. Panetta, Chuck Hagel and William J. Perry -- condemned Trump's firing of senior military leaders last month and asked that the House and the Senate hold \"immediate hearings to assess the national security implications of Mr. Trump's dismissals.\"\n\nHouse Republicans are facing voters angry about Musk's assault on the federal bureaucracy at town hall gatherings around the country, a hint of a growing backlash.\n\nJim Farley, the CEO of Ford, was critical last month of Trump's threat to impose tariffs on cars and components from Mexico and Canada, saying they \"will blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we have never seen.\"\n\nTrump made good on that threat and imposed 25% tariffs this week on all products from Canada and Mexico. But after a conference call Wednesday with executives from the three largest automakers, including Farley, Trump said he would pause tariffs on cars coming into the United States from Canada and Mexico for one month.\n\nLevitsky said he had some hope. The United States, he said, has a \"wealthy and diverse opposition,\" and rather than outright authoritarianism, there could be \"a slow and gradual slide into a gray area.\"\n\nAs he put it, \"no democracy this old or this rich has ever broken down.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"WASHINGTON -- The silence grows louder every day.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/people-are-going-silent-fearing-retribution-trump-critics-muzzle-themselves/article_b08ff766-301c-5956-9a3f-1ce97742e80e.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-06 19:26:10","author":"Elisabeth Bumiller,North Adams Pride","authors":["Elisabeth Bumiller","North Adams Pride"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.005},{"id":297477890,"title":"A message for Trump and MAGA: Don't underestimate Canada","text":"Canadians, best known for their niceness rather than fierce nationalism, have been stirred and galvanized by Donald Trump’s childish insults and belligerent actions toward their country. In the process, our usually laid-back neighbors to the north have revived their country’s Liberal Party while striking deep fear in the heart of red America. \n\nIt wasn’t long ago that Canada’s Conservative Party was headed for an electoral landslide, with Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s popularity hitting rock bottom. Just like every other governing party in the industrialized world, the country’s Liberal Party was the target of voter fury due to high inflation, leading Trudeau to announce in January that he would resign as party leader and prime minister. \n\nBut between threatening and then enacting and then backing down on tariffs, mockingly referring to Trudeau as “governor,” and demeaning Canada as “the 51st state” while threatening to annex the sovereign nation, Trump has single-handedly revived Canadian Liberals, who are now running just slightly behind the Tories this election year. Canadians are set to head to the polls on Oct. 20.\n\nIt is an act of breathtaking idiocy for Trump to turn our closest ally into a firebreathing foe that’s foaming at the mouth to take us on. But he’s certainly being cheered on by his minions in online forums, where the conventional wisdom is “Canada is small so they have no chance, they are too dependent on America!” \n\nWeirdly, few are trying to justify a trade war with no rationale behind it. Trump’s claim that fentanyl is coming into the U.S. from Canada is not only wildly overblown, but an excuse and a legal necessity to give Trump the power to enact tariffs without congressional approval. But that hasn’t stopped his cult members from cheering on the world’s dumbest trade war. \n\nYou know who isn’t cheering him on? \n\nThe Wall Street Journal’s editorial board.\n\n“We’ve courted Mr. Trump’s ire by calling the Mexico and Canada levies the ‘dumbest’ in history, and we may have understated the point,” they wrote. “His taxes will hit every cross-border transaction, and the North American vehicle market is so interconnected that some cars cross a border as many as eight times as they’re assembled.” \n\nThis is the same editorial board that said a vote for Kamala Harris was an endorsement for “the bloody-mindedness of the modern left, with its regulatory coercion, cultural imperialism, economic statism, and desire to strip judicial independence.” Meanwhile, the editorial board argued, Trump “would stop the crush of new regulation, restore a freer market for health insurance, unleash U.S. energy production, and reform the tax code. His default priority would be growth, which the U.S. desperately needs after a decade of progressive focus on income redistribution and the worst economic recovery in 70 years.”\n\nYou know who wouldn’t have enacted “the dumbest” tariffs in history? Kamala Harris, that’s who. \n\nYou know who else isn’t cheering Trump’s tariffs? Rural Americans. \n\n“Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States,” Trump wrote in a social media post. “Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!”\n\nThe reality for those farmers? \n\nThe Des Moines Register reported the following, while noting that (red-voting) Iowa “leads the nation in corn, pork, egg and ethanol production, ranks second in growing soybeans and 10th in raising beef: “Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa would respond with immediate 25% tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of U.S. imports and on another $86.2 billion if Trump's tariffs were still in place in 21 days. China's commerce ministry on Tuesday said its new levies, which take effect March 10, will include a 15% markup on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton and 10% on soybeans, pork, beef, fruits and dairy. Mexico did not immediately announce its response.”\n\nBut are farmers having fun, as Trump said they would?\n\n“Lower prices aren’t fun for farmers,” the president of the Iowa Farmers Union board told The Des Moines Register. “Losing reliable trade markets is not fun for farmers. It’s unrealistic to expect that domestic demand is going to magically take up the slack.” \n\nIn deep-Red Kansas, the president of the Kansas Farm Bureau said, “We truly believe that tariffs are going to hurt us in the short term, but we certainly hope that it brings a better deal in the long term.” Part of their problem isn’t just that the American market is smaller than the global one (it’s simple math that escapes Trump), but American farmers get 80% of their fertilizer from Canada—and it’s suddenly 25% more expensive. \n\nThe American Farm Bureau is doing math: “Mexico's $30 billion a year in our ag exports. Canada's $29 (billion). China's been about $24 (billion). Add them up. Those three countries are half of all U.S. agricultural exports.” \n\nYeah, Kansans aren’t having fun either. \n\nDuring Tuesday’s speech in front of a joint session of Congress, Trump asked farmers to “bear with me again” as he once again destroys their foreign markets. Last time he did this in 2018, he bailed out farmers to the tune of at least $23 billion in response to another one of his trade wars. (The Topeka Capital-Journal, deep in farm country, says the number was $28 billion.) \n\nThis time around, Trump is too busy hollowing out federal agencies (including the Department of Agriculture) while his billionaire co-president Elon Musk and his cost-cutting bros at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency cancel out every bit of aid they can get their hands on. And why would Democrats in Congress go along with a bailout this time? This is exactly what rural America voted for, and there are few farm-state Democrats left to carry their water. \n\nFunny enough, one prominent messenger for the “elections have consequences” platform is none other than Republican Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley. \n\nWhile the consequences from tariffs aren’t “very good news for farmers,” he said, \"[Trump is] doing what the voters voted him to do. Elections are supposed to have consequences.”\n\nAs for those consequences? \n\n“We’re just going to have to see how it works out. If he's doing it for negotiating purposes, to get people to the table, to get tariffs down [and] we have lower tariffs around the world, then I'll have to say he's been successful. And I would say amen to his work,” Grassley said. “And if he fails to do that, and it's catastrophic for Iowa and the nation's economy, then I'd have to say, 'I told you so.’”\n\nGiven the fallout from Trump’s first trade war and the tens of billions that were needed to bail out farmers then, there is nothing to suggest that this round won’t be even more catastrophic for the so-called heartland of America. \n\nAnd with Musk and his billionaire buddies feeding at the government trough, there won’t be any money left to bail anyone out this time. \n\nAnyone who still thinks Canada is powerless isn’t paying attention—and Trump’s most recent retreat indicates that even he gets it. Actually enacting tariffs would extend the pain far beyond farm country to home builders (as if the price of housing isn’t already high enough), the spirits industry in red Kentucky, the auto industry (its carve-out is only for one month), and more. \n\nAll of that would lead to higher prices for Americans, breaking Trump’s campaign-winning promise to tame inflation on “day one.” And for what? \n\nCanada is certainly not powerless in this trade war and Trump’s bullying has only rallied our northern neighbors the way Russian aggression rallied Ukraine. In a battle of wills, I’m betting on Canada to better withstand any coming economic pain.","summary":"Canadians, best known for their niceness rather than fierce nationalism, have been stirred and galvanized by Donald Trump’s childish insults and belligerent actions toward their country.

Gavin Newsom put distance between himself and his party, and found common ground with influential conservative activist and commentator Charlie Kirk when the term-limited California governor and possible 2028 presidential contender agreed that biological men in women's sports is \"deeply unfair.\" \"The young man who's about to win the state championship in the long jump in female sports, that shouldn't happen,\" Kirk said on Newsom's debut episode on his new podcast, \"This is Gavin Newsom,\" on Thursday. Kirk, a MAGA world rock star and ally of President Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. who leads the powerful Turning Point USA youth organization, asked Newsom, \"You, as the governor, should step out and say no. Would you do something like that? Would you say no men in female sports?\" \"Well, I think it's an issue of fairness,\" Newsom replied. \"I completely agree with you on that. It's deeply unfair.\" GAVIN NEWSOM ASKS CHARLIE KIRK TO GIVE HIS PARTY 'ADVICE' IN ONE-ON-ONE PODCAST INTERVIEW Kirk further pressed Newsom on whether he would condemn the recent victory of a transgender track athlete with a more than 40-foot jump at Jurupa Valley High School in Southern California. Newsom - who was ahead of many in his party when, two decades ago, as San Francisco mayor, he defied existing state laws and issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples - didn't directly address the win, but said \"it's a fairness issue.\" The student, AB Hernandez, won an invitational meet on Feb. 22, booting out a female runner-up who had jumped just over 32 feet in their competition category. Hernandez also took first place in two other events at the meet. \"So that's easy to call out the unfairness of that,\" Newsom, a Democratic Party torchbearer, said. \"There's also a humility and a grace… these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well.\" \"So both things I can hold in my hand,\" the governor continued. \"How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that I think you know is inherent in you, but not always expressed on the issue?\" KAROLINE LEAVITT ADDRESSES DEMOCRATS DEFYING TRANS ATHLETE BAN DEMAND: 'CAN'T SAY YOU ARE THE PARTY OF WOMEN' Transgender athletes in California have long been protected prior to Newsom's administration under AB 1266, also known as the School Success and Opportunity Act. The law was signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, in August 2013. However, Senate Bill 132, also known as the Transgender Respect, Agency and Dignity Act, allows inmates to request cells and searches that align with their gender identity, which Newsom signed in September 2020. Newsom's comments in California came as Senate Democrats in Washington D.C. earlier this week voted unanimously to block a GOP-led bill that would prohibit federally funded schools from allowing transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. Title IX government protections - which cover schools - prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities that receive funding from the federal government. Democrats argue that policies to restrict transgender athletes’ participation in team sports are a form of discrimination. There are relatively few transgender athletes competing at the collegiate level. Regardless, Republicans have spotlighted in recent years that transgender women playing in female sports hold an unfair physical advantage. And the GOP attacked Democrats over transgender issues up and down the ballot on the campaign trail last year. That included a politically cutting ad from Trump's campaign that spotlighted then-Vice President Kamala Harris' support for taxpayer-funded gender transition-related medical care for federal prisoners and detained immigrants. \"It was a great ad,\" Newsom said in the podcast, which was first reported by Politico. \"She didn’t even react to it, which was even more devastating.\" Trump signed an executive order titled, \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" in February, which said transgender athletes in women sports is \"demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls.\" The order requires institutions receiving federal funding to abide by Title IX and follow the definitions of biological sex. Newsom noted he has four children, including two daughters, and highlighted that both he and his wife played college-level sports. \"I revere sports, so the issue of fairness is completely legit,\" Newsom said. And pointing to Kirk's efforts on the campaign trail, he emphasized the right was \"able to weaponize that issue at another level.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Newsom noted that Republicans have been successful in portraying Democrats as out of step with most Americans on the issue. \"We’re getting crushed on it. Crushed. Crushed,\" he said. Some Golden State leaders from the left and the right were critical of the governor's comments. The California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus, in a statement on social media, charged that \"sometimes Gavin Newsom goes for the Profile in Courage, sometimes not. We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks. All students deserve the academic and health benefits of sports activity, and until Donald Trump began obsessing about it, playing on a team consistent with one’s gender has not been a problem since the standard was passed in 2013.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And Will O'Neil, chair of the Orange County Republican Party, took to social media to claim \"the difference between \"redefining Newsom\" and actual Newsom policies is going to get exposed in these podcasts.\" \"Entertainment is one thing, governing is different,\" he added.","summary":"Gov.

Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, used the inaugural episode of his new podcast to break from progressives by speaking out against allowing transgender women and girls to compete in female sports.\n\nNewsom made his declaration in an extended conversation with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old who built the influential Turning Point USA organization that helped President Donald Trump increase his support last fall among the youngest generation of voters. Kirk, like Trump, has been a vocal opponent of allowing transgender women and girls to participate. \n\n“I think it’s an issue of fairness, I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness — it’s deeply unfair,” Newsom told Kirk on “This is Gavin Newsom.”\n\n“I am not wrestling with the fairness issue,” continued Newsom, who played varsity baseball as a college student. “I totally agree with you. … I revere sports. So, the issue of fairness is completely legit.”\n\nThe governor’s comments are the latest in Democrats’ efforts to reconcile a 2024 election that returned Trump to the White House and gave Republicans control of both chambers of Congress. Among the disagreements since November is how much cultural issues – as opposed to economic policy and other matters – explain the party’s losses.\n\nOverall, polling suggests that allowing transgender female athletes to play on women’s teams isn’t broadly popular. Even most Democrats — around 7 in 10 — oppose allowing transgender female athletes to participate in women’s sports, according to a January New York Times/Ipsos poll. A 2023 Gallup poll also found that Democrats were divided on whether transgender people should be able to play on sports teams that match their current gender identity.\n\nNewsom, who has long positioned himself as a social progressive, drew sharp rebukes from LGBTQ+ advocates.\n\n“Sometimes Gavin Newsom goes for the Profile in Courage, sometimes not,” said California Assemblyman Chris Ward and state Sen. Carolina Menjivar, who lead the state’s LGBTQ+ legislative caucus. “We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks.”\n\nTony Hoang, executive director of Equality California, said he was “disappointed and angered” by Newsom’s statements and that they “added to the heartbreak and fear” the transgender community feels under the Trump administration.\n\n“Right now, transgender youth, their families, their doctors, and their teachers are facing unprecedented attacks from extremist politicians who want to eviscerate their civil rights and erase them from public life,” Hoang said. “They need leaders who will unequivocally fight for them.”\n\nCalifornia law, enacted before Newsom became governor, requires schools in the state to allow transgender athletes to play on school sports teams consistent with their gender identity. Republican state lawmakers introduced bills in the Legislature this year to ban that practice, but they would be difficult to pass in the Democrat-dominated statehouse. The governor’s office did not immediately respond for comment Thursday on the proposals.\n\nBeyond questions about athletics, there is less public support for broader restrictions on transgender rights and issues like medical care for transgender people, particularly among Democrats.\n\nAccording to AP VoteCast, 55% of voters in the 2024 election said support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far, while about 2 in 10 said it’s been about right and a similar share said it hasn’t gone far enough. Voters were also slightly more likely to oppose than favor laws that ban gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy, for minors who identify as transgender.\n\nBut Republicans have nonetheless sought to capitalize on the cultural touchstone that sports represent in America. \n\nTrump regularly hammered Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, Newsom’s fellow Californian, for supporting LGBTQ+ rights. Trump promised at his rallies to get “transgender insanity the hell out of our schools” and “keep men out of women’s sports.” His campaign also spent tens of millions of dollars on television and digital ads with the searing summation: “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”\n\n“Boy, did I see how you guys were able to weaponize it,” Newsom told Kirk, before yielding to Kirk’s protest and saying instead that the ads were an effective “highlight” during the campaign.\n\nSince taking office, T rump has threatened to withhold federal money from schools that allow transgender athletes to compete in women’s’ or girls’ events. He declared victory on the issue recently when the NCAA, which governs collegiate athletics in the U.S., changed its policy to restrict women’s sporting events to those athletes who were assigned the female gender at birth. Previously, the NCAA had a sport-by-sport policy determined by the respective sports’ national or international governing bodies. \n\nWard and Menjivar, the California lawmakers, said playing on a team consistent with one’s gender hasn’t been a problem “until Donald Trump began obsessing about it.”\n\nKirk, not Newsom, brought up the overall issue during their hour-plus conversation, which focused in part on how Democrats can rebuild a broader coalition of voters. Kirk pressed Newsom on whether he would speak out in opposition to transgender women athletes in competition.\n\nThe governor attempted to mitigate his comments, saying the discussion is about more than competitive advantage.\n\n“There’s also a humility and a grace that these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with, as well,” Newsom said. “So, both things I can hold in my hand. How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that I think is inherent in you but not always expressed on the issue and at the same time deal with the unfairness.”\n\nStill, Newsom’s approach marks a different political tack than he took on same-sex marriage more than two decades ago. As San Francisco mayor in 2004, Newsom drew national attention for the first time by directing the city clerk to begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses. \n\nThe move prompted legal action that led to a 2008 ruling from the California Supreme Court legalizing same-sex marriage in the nation’s largest state. That decision came seven years before the U.S. Supreme Court established same-sex marriage as a national right. —\n\nBarrow reported from Atlanta.

And if Harris were to put herself forward for California governor, it would mark her first major political move since losing the 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump.Some Democrats believe that if Harris were to run, she would start ahead of the pack, with national name recognition, a much-coveted mailing list and a deep bench of volunteers, resulting in a \"field-clearing effect\" on the Democratic nomination.What To KnowDespite not having declared her intention to run for the position, former Vice President Harris is believed by some to be a front-runner due to her name recognition in California.And polls reflect this. According to Emerson College Polling/Inside California Politics/The Hill, conducted between February 10-11 among 1,000 California registered voters, nearly 6 in 10 Democratic primary voters in California, 57 percent, would vote for Harris as governor.Former Representative Katie Porter, who left the House for an unsuccessful Senate run last year, received 9 percent support, while former California State Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa and current Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis each garnered 4 percent. Seventeen percent of voters remained undecided.Without Harris in the race, Porter's support rose to 21 percent, followed by Villaraigosa at 9 percent and Kounalakis at 5 percent. A significant 45 percent of Democratic primary voters were undecided. The poll had a margin of error of +/- 3 points.Another poll from UC Berkeley and the Los Angeles Times, conducted in October, showed Harris with a substantial advantage over other candidates for the 2026 California gubernatorial race.According to the poll, about 72 percent of Democrats said they would be very likely or somewhat likely support Harris, compared with 8 percent of Republicans and 38 percent of voters with no party preference. Democrats in the state have a 2-1 voter registration advantage over Republicans. The poll surveyed 4,838 registered voters in California and had a margin of error of about 2 percentage points.But a Capitol Weekly poll published on February 6 showed Harris in a closer race among the entire electorate. It showed 23 percent of all voters would support her, with 21 percent backing Republican businessman John Cox. Porter placed third with 16 percent, and former Republican candidate for state controller Lanhee Chen received 10 percent support. The poll surveyed 1,198 voters in California. The margin of error was not available.More than half-dozen candidates have officially announced that they are running for California governor. They include former Democratic mayor of Los Angeles Antonio Villaraigosa, former speaker of the California State Assembly Toni Atkins, the state's current lieutenant governor Eleni Kounalakis, as well as California State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond and former state controller Betty Yee.Meanwhile, former Representative Porter is reportedly considering a run for governor, while former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra is also seen as a potential candidate. On the Republican side, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco announced his bid last month, while former Fox News host and conservative commentator Steve Hilton is weighing a gubernatorial run, according to Fox News.Former Trump aide Richard Grenell told reporters last month that he would consider running if Harris enters the race.\"If Kamala Harris runs for Governor, I believe that she has such baggage and hundreds of millions of dollars in educating the voters of how terrible she is, that it's a new day in California and that the Republican actually has a shot,\" he said. \"And I wouldn't say no [to running].\"Pressure on Harris to run escalated last month when Democratic California Attorney General Rob Bonta endorsed her after saying he wouldn't run.\"I would support her if she ran, I've always supported her in everything she's done. She would be field-clearing,\" Politico quoted the attorney general as saying. Bonta considered running for governor last year, but changed his mind after President Donald Trump defeated Harris in the presidential race, according to Politico.Politico also she instructed her advisers to keep her options open for either a 2026 gubernatorial campaign in her home state or a presidential bid in 2028.\"I am staying in the fight,\" she repeated during phone calls.Meanwhile, News Nation reported this week that unidentified sources have said Harris is \"absolutely\" planning on running for Governor and that \"she was on the party circuit\" in Los Angeles during the Oscars.Last month, Harris shrugged off questions about a possible gubernatorial bid so soon after her presidential run while visiting areas impacted by recent wildfires in Los Angeles.\"I have been home for two weeks and three days. My plans are to be in touch with my community, to be in touch with the leaders and figure out what I can do to support them,\" she said.\"I am here and would be here regardless of the office I hold, because it is the right thing to do, which is to show up in your community and thank the folks who are on the ground.\"Harris has had an extensive career in California politics, previously serving as San Francisco district attorney and the state's attorney general. She was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016.What People Are SayingSpencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said: \"If Vice President Harris enters the Democratic Primary, she would start as the clear favorite. Without Harris in the race, the primary is wide open.\"Katie Porter said during a University of California, Irvine panel interview in December: \"If Vice President Harris were to choose to run, I am certain that that would have a near field-clearing effect on the Democratic side.\"What Happens NextCalifornia will elect its next governor in 2026 when Newsom's term ends. Newsom is believed to be a contender for the 2028 Democratic nomination for president. However, he has not yet expressed any desire to run.In November, Newsom had +550 odds of becoming the next president, according to SportsBettingDime, which amounts to a 15 percent chance. Harris had +2500 odds, or a 4 percent chance.","summary":"Despite not having declared her intention to run for the position, former Vice President Kamala Harris is believed by some to be a front-runner.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-california-governor-polling-2040691","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2601788/kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-06 18:48:49","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":297465394,"title":"Vice President to Governor?

Vice President Kamala Harris is reportedly planning to run for governor of California in 2026, aiming to succeed Gavin Newsom when his term ends, according to sources. Harris, who has been actively shoring up support in influential circles, was recently seen networking at high-profile events in Los Angeles during the Oscars season. Harris running for California governor?While she skipped the star-studded Vanity Fair party, she attended smaller, exclusive gatherings filled with powerful figures, including media mogul Barry Diller. This move signals her efforts to reconnect with key players in Hollywood and politics as she prepares for her next political chapter. Harris’s journey into politics began as a prosecutor in California, where she served as San Francisco’s District Attorney and later as the state’s Attorney General. Her rise continued when she was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016, becoming only the second Black woman in history to serve in the chamber. In 2020, she made history again as the first woman, first Black American, and first Asian American to be elected Vice President. Why is Harris again returning for California?However, her 2024 presidential campaign ended in defeat, prompting her to refocus on her home state. Since then, she has been receiving personal attention from influential figures like Bryan Lourd, head of Creative Artists Agency (CAA), as she rebuilds her political strategy. Harris’s potential gubernatorial bid reflects her deep ties to California and her ambition to return to a leadership role in the state where her political career began. Her efforts to engage with Hollywood power brokers and influential networks highlight her determination to secure the support needed for a successful campaign. If she runs, Harris would bring her extensive experience and historic legacy to the race, positioning herself as a formidable candidate in California’s political landscape.","summary":"It looks like former Vice President Kamala Harris has finally recovered from the US Presidential election 2024 loss and is looking to run for Governor in the 2026 elections in California, as per a source","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/vice-president-to-governor-kamala-harris-absolutely-gearing-up-for-californias-top-job-in-2026-source-confirms/articleshow/118768229.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-118768227,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-47180,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-06 18:43:05","author":"The Feed","authors":["The Feed"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.384},{"id":297448458,"title":"DOJ Asked to Investigate Joe Biden's 'Cognitive Decline' While President","text":"A Missouri Republican has called for the Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate the \"cognitive decline\" of former President Joe Biden.\"I am demanding the DOJ investigated whether President Biden's cognitive decline allowed unelected staff to push through radical policy without his knowing approval,\" Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey wrote. \"If true, these executive orders, pardons, and all other actions are unconstitutional and legally void.\"Newsweek contacted the DOJ for more information via email.Why It MattersBailey said that if Biden were unaware of any executive orders he signed, plus other actions, they would be rendered void.His statement shows that there is a continued focus on the Biden administration from Republicans, despite the party holding power in both houses of Congress and the White House.What To KnowIn a statement on social media, Bailey called on the DOJ, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, to investigate whether Biden was fully aware of all orders he signed while he was president.In his letter to the DOJ, Bailey blamed high-level Democrats for manipulating Biden, including former Vice President Kamala Harris: \"There are profound reasons to suspect that Biden's staff and political allies exploited his mental decline to issue purported presidential orders without his knowing approval.\"Speaker Johnson, for example, reported that staff and elected officials—including former Vice President Kamala Harris and former Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer—tried to prevent Johnson from meeting with Biden.\"Though presidents always have gatekeepers, in Biden's case, the walls around him were higher and the controls greater, according to Democratic lawmakers, donors and aides who worked for Biden and other administrations.

Its owner wasn’t aware until hours later","text":"By Liam Reilly | CNN\n\nThe Los Angeles Times’ billionaire owner, who unveiled an AI tool that generates opposing perspectives to be displayed on opinion stories, was unaware the new tool had created pro-KKK arguments less than 24 hours after it launched — and hours after the AI comments had been taken down. The incident presents a massive hurdle for the Times, which looks to win back old subscribers and woo new ones with a new suite of offerings.\n\nDuring an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Patrick Soon-Shiong, the Times’ executive chairman, admitted he had seen neither the piece nor the AI response. But he said the content’s removal showed that there are operational “checks and balances” to the recently introduced system, pegging the moment as a learning opportunity.\n\n“(The incident is) a good lesson to show that at least artificial intelligence is not fully there yet (…) it’s in an attempt to understand that,” Soon-Shiong said.\n\nOn early Tuesday, the new AI tool generated counterpoints to a February 25 column from Times columnist Gustavo Arellano. Arellano’s column argued that Anaheim, California, ought to not forget the Ku Klux Klan’s role in its past — calling the white supremacist group “a stain on a place that likes to celebrate the positive” — and connecting it to today’s political landscape. But the divergent views generated by the Times’ AI produced a softer vision of the far-right group, which it called “‘white Protestant culture’ responding to societal changes rather than an explicitly hate-driven movement.”\n\nWhile the AI-generated comments have since been removed from the piece, and Arellano chimed in to say the “AI actually got that right” since “OCers have minimized the 1920s Klan as basically anti-racists since it happened,” the newspaper owner’s lack of awareness about the controversy is a glaring issue.\n\nArellano’s piece is not the only one to have contained an AI-generated error or misleading comments within 24 hours of the AI tool’s introduction. An op-ed from Scott Jennings about President Donald Trump’s response to the Los Angeles wildfires came under scrutiny after the Times’ tool labeled the piece as centrist despite its right-leaning talking points. The story’s AI-generated counterperspective also failed to note that Trump had threatened to withhold federal aid to Los Angeles unless its leaders complied with specific demands.\n\nThe AI tool, which is dubbed “Insights,” is part of a suite of announcements unveiled by Soon-Shiong on Monday. In addition to the Insights button that appears alongside all opinion stories — a section that has now been rebranded as Voices — Soon-Shiong also debuted a bias meter and live-stream programming from LA Times Studios.\n\nThe changes come several months after the Soon-Shiong announced his intention to add AI tools to the website, part of the publisher’s push to appeal to younger audiences and conservatives. They also come after months of turmoil have rocked the outlet, including an exodus of readers and editorial board members following a blocked op-ed, mass layoffs, voluntary buyouts, a botched edit that reversed a writer’s position and comments from Soon-Shiong that undermined his own reporter.\n\nVoices and Insights\n\nDespite the immediate alarming results, Soon-Shiong told CNN that Insights’ AI-generated pieces do not seek to create divisive responses but, rather, inclusive ones.\n\n“It’s actually trying to say, ‘OK, this is what this piece is trying to say with (…) all the references from,’” Soon-Shiong said. “And then, if you don’t agree with what this piece is saying — because it’s a voice, it’s not news — this is the opportunity for us to share with you an alternative view that somebody else would look at tied to its references.”\n\nIf readers disagree with a Voices piece, the Insights button should provide an alternate view, he said. He added that the new Voices hub stems from that inclusive inclination and a desire to clearly separate the opinion section from the newsroom.\n\nInsights deploys the Times’ in-house Graphene AI content management system to determine a story’s bias, running a word-by-word analysis to generate an alternate view. Graphene was trained by partnering with external AI models and using decades of Times content and historical pieces, all of which were validated using machine learning and an editorial review process to establish a bias scale, Soon-Shiong said. In his Monday letter to readers, Soon-Shiong described the tool as “an experimental, evolving technology.” But he told CNN that a team spent months continuing to develop the tool after he initially teased it in December. Like other AI platforms, the tool will continue to learn as it ingests more Voices.\n\nAI-generated perspectives are accompanied by sourcing so that readers can learn more about a particular position. But a blistering Nieman Lab review found several problems with the sources and even the way they’re cited. On some occasions, the AI tool cited mediocre or less-than-reputable sources, while on other occasions it duplicated sources in citations. Elsewhere, the AI tool used citations to misleading effect, articulating a point missing in the cited source.\n\nTo correct errors, Soon-Shiong says there is some level of human oversight but it’s hard for the team to validate all responses in real-time given the scale at which the tool is being applied. Beyond the team in charge of overseeing the tool, readers who encounter AI errors are encouraged to report issues on the Times’ Insights page or in the comments section.\n\nThe Times is hardly the first publisher to imbue its website with AI tools, and most newsrooms or news tools that have added AI to writing or reporting have yielded disastrous results. Two years after OpenAI launched ChatGPT, even the most sophisticated AI chatbots remain plagued by accuracy and reliability issues.\n\nThere are, of course, streamlining benefits to AI in the newsroom: AI tools can expedite newsgathering and, with human oversight, catch problems in articles. But publishing unvetted content penned by AI is a massive gambit — it risks delivering inaccuracies that misinform readers and undermine trust.\n\nLA Times Studio and LA Times Next\n\nThe live-stream element — a project dubbed “The Stream” from LA Times Studio, the Times’ production studio that’s behind the outlet’s TV, film and audio projects — was also introduced Monday. Under the venture, the studio will produce 12 hours of original live-streaming per day spanning news, entertainment, food, business, culture, lifestyle and true crime. To fuel the massive undertaking, LA Times Studio is working closely with the newsroom, Soon-Shiong said, but it’s also onboarding studio engagement staff to handle the technical aspects of streaming, shooting and producing.\n\nAbsent from Soon-Shiong’s list of announcements on Monday was any mention of LA Times Next, a project the billionaire has been quietly developing alongside the others.\n\nIn February, Status described LA Times Next as “a new entity that will prominently feature digital-first personalities, many of whom will appeal to the MAGA base.” But Soon-Shiong dismissed that description as “speculation.” While he declined to clarify what the project will entail, he told CNN that LA Times Next will be located in Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Nashville and several other places nationwide.\n\nSoon-Shiong also declined to comment on Status’ report that Jennings is attached to the project and that there have been conversations about adding Candace Owens and Ana Kasparian.\n\n“We do things in a very thoughtful way to involve the community and, when we release LA Times Next, we will then ‘inform the truth’ rather than have so-called journalists write speculation and then ask us to respond to speculation,” Soon-Shiong said.\n\nTimes readers can expect to hear more about LA Times Next in three to six months, he said.\n\nThe editorial board\n\nThe billionaire’s other project for the Times is rebuilding the paper’s editorial board, an especially urgent task given Carla Hall, the Times’ last remaining editorial board member, accepted a buyout last week after 32 years with the company.\n\nHall’s departure follows her peers’ exodus after Soon-Shiong blocked an op-ed endorsing then-Vice President Kamala Harris for president at the 11th hour in October. The move has been publicly critiqued by Times readers and staffers alike, many of whom ended their subscriptions or left the paper over allegations that the Times owner preemptively bent the knee to Trump.\n\nThe Times owner has previously said that the old editorial board “veered very left” and that a new board should “have somebody who would trend right, and more importantly, somebody that would trend in the middle.” While the billionaire still won’t say who will staff a new editorial board, he said that “it’s time for a rebirth and reinvigoration of a next generation of editorial members who recognize the new world as we see it.”\n\nThe changes are an attempt to regain old subscribers while courting new ones at a difficult time for the news industry. Like Soon-Shiong’s Times, Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post has lost subscribers over his involvement, hemorrhaging 250,000 subscribers in October after a pro-Harris endorsement was blocked and at least 75,000 in 48 hours last week over his opinion section overhaul. The Times lost more than 7,000 readers in October, almost 2% of its total subscription base.\n\nBezos’ Wednesday shakeup of the Post’s opinion section has similarly left staffers in a state of rebellion, possibly worsening the low morale that has for months precipitated several staff resignations and departures at the Post. But Soon-Shiong, whose last few months have resembled the billionaire Post owner’s, applauded the move on X: “Welcome to the club Jeff!”\n\nAlready, Soon-Shiong claims he’s received calls from old subscribers looking to resubscribe.\n\n“It’s only one day, but, again, I think engaging all Americans, and the opportunity to have engagement with the young — the younger readers — and to create a platform that allows interactivity, connectivity is the best that we can try,” the billionaire said.\n\nBut what a day it was.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

She changed society forever when she decided the horrific mass rape trial of her ex-husband and 50 other men would be held in public because “it's not for us to have shame – it’s for them”.\n\nMs Pelicot is joined in the top 10 by the UK’s first woman chancellor Rachel Reeves, Olympic gold medal winner Keely Hodgkinson, and Charli XCX, the pioneering pop artist who dominated this year’s Brit Awards with four out of five wins.\n\nOther stars on the list include athlete Imane Khelif, who remained dignified and defiant in the boxing ring even as her historic gold medal at the Paris Olympics was overshadowed by a gender row, actor Cynthia Erivo, one of only a very few to be nominated for an EGOT (an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony Award), and Tasha Ghouri, who first won fans as the first ever deaf contestant to appear on ITV’s Love Island.\n\nThe Independent has made the deliberate decision to not exclude women whom readers may disagree with or disapprove of. Influence does not mean adulation – in fact, some of the most influential figures of history are difficult and controversial, to say the least.\n\nStriking portraits of 12 of the women will be on display at Outernet in central London for the rest of March, raising awareness of the work of The Independent’s charity partner Refuge, the UK’s largest domestic abuse charity, with hundreds of thousands expected to view the exhibition.\n\nWe hope you enjoy reading about the phenomenal achievements of all these 50 powerful women.\n\n1. Gisèle Pelicot\n\nIt was the most horrific of circumstances that forced Gisèle Pelicot into making a decision that would change the world and turn her into an icon across the globe. In a brave and groundbreaking move, the unassuming 72-year-old waived her anonymity in last year’s trial of her now ex-husband and 50 other men who all raped or sexually assaulted her after she had been drugged. “Shame must change sides,” she said in a statement that would become the slogan of her case, sparking a global conversation on rape culture as seismic as the #MeToo movement. Every day of the gruelling three-month trial, the French grandmother sat across from her abusers in the courtroom in Avignon – the epitome of dignity, courage and strength as she embodied her powerful message that it is the perpetrators, not the victims, who should feel shame for sexual crimes.\n\nShe has since become a global symbol of the struggle against sexual violence and has changed the way the world treats survivors. It is this achievement that means Ms Pelicot tops The Independent’s list of the most influential women of 2025. Her lawyer Stéphane Babonneau told The Independent she is “honoured” to have been chosen as the most influential woman of the year.\n\n2. Kate, Princess of Wales\n\nHow the Princess of Wales has dealt with her treatment for cancer over the last year has shown what a vital role she plays in the royal family. Her initial withdrawal from much of public life and subsequent return to formal duties has secured her place in the public’s affection. In June she made her first appearance of the year at Trooping the Colour and has since increased her public workload with charity and early-years work her main focus. Three months later, Kate released a moving personal video in which she disclosed that she was now free of cancer, marking a notable shift away from the more detached approach the firm has leant towards in the past.\n\nIn October, the princess made a surprise visit to Southport to meet the bereaved families of the horrific mass stabbings in which three young girls died. It marked her first joint official outing with her husband the Prince of Wales since her course of chemotherapy ended in the summer. Coming at the end of a year in which the royal family faced a number of health scares, Kate’s 2024 Christmas carol service was especially poignant, as she encouraged people to \"turn to love, not fear\". Last month, her Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood published the Shaping Us Framework – an ambitious campaign described as her “life’s work” that is aimed at raising the profile of the crucial period of a child’s development from pregnancy to the age of five.\n\n3. Rachel Reeves\n\nRachel Reeves made history when she became the UK’s first female chancellor after Labour’s landslide general election win last year – and so takes third place on the influence list this year having previously featured in the top 10. Addressing parliament as she delivered her first Budget in October, she said in a powerful message: “This is the first Budget in this country’s history to be delivered by a woman. I am deeply proud. Girls and young women everywhere, I say, let there be no ceiling on your ambitions, your hopes and your dreams.”\n\nTaking office at a time of economic and geopolitical crisis, she has faced criticism for some of the early decisions of her tenure, including cutting winter fuel allowance. She has had to navigate the tightrope between the demands of business leaders and working people. She has also pledged to use her position to improve life for women across Britain, including tackling the gender pay gap, strengthening rights at work, and investing in childcare as part of her push for equal opportunities.\n\n4. Kemi Badenoch\n\nKemi Badenoch smashed another glass ceiling in British politics last year when she became the first Black leader of a major UK political party, earning her an obvious fourth place on the list. Although Badenoch says such an achievement should be seen as unremarkable, she represents another first for the Conservatives who have seen the first ethnic minority leader (Benjamin Disraeli), first woman (Margaret Thatcher) and first leader of Asian heritage (Rishi Sunak).\n\nThe leader of the opposition, however, faces an uphill task to rebuild her party after a record defeat in the 2024 election leaving them with just 121 MPs. The 45-year-old is trying to win back trust and simultaneously hold off Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. While her reluctance to wheel out new policies at an early stage has raised questions, she nevertheless has carved out her own political niche by recognising the Tory failures of the last 14 years. Speaking to The Independent for International Women’s Day, Badenoch said: “Gender equality to me is about equality of opportunity – it’s making sure that every woman can fulfil her potential.”\n\n5. Claudia Winkleman\n\nNo one in showbiz has a bigger fringe, wears more fake tan or does more each January to cheer up our grey nation than Claudia Winkleman – which is at least partly why she has made it so high on the list once again this year. The presenter, who returned for season three of the BBC’s smash hit series The Traitors at the start of this year, stole all our hearts again on a record-breaking season of the show made all the better by her camp asides, which manage to simultaneously drip with both dread and wit. Thanks to Winkleman, swathes of women across the country have started dressing in “Highland goth” style.\n\nAnd the 53-year-old will soon be hosting the keenly anticipated celebrity version of the show too, which she’ll be squeezing into her busy schedule alongside the three other series she already hosts: Strictly Come Dancing, The Piano, and One Question. She is officially the queen of TV.\n\n6. Keely Hodgkinson\n\nMoments after Keely Hodgkinson crossed the line in Paris to win Olympic gold in the summer, she was passed a crown by a member of the crowd. Coupled with the 800m medal hanging proudly around her neck, it represented Hodkingson’s rise to becoming the nation’s next sporting icon. This was truly a golden year for the 22-year-old from Manchester, who delivered against the pressure of expectation in a stirring display of pure running power and steely focus. The Sports Personality of the Year title followed, as did fashion shows in Milan with Giorgio Armani. But despite the glamour, Hodkingson remains humble and determined to continue her journey to improve, with the World Championship title and 800m world record in her sights in 2025.\n\nHer gold medal has also inspired the next generation and there are early signs that it has been a transformative moment. “It's so amazing to hear the stories from little girls and boys who watched me perform in Paris,” Hodgkinson said. “That's what really inspires me.” She told The Independent for International Women’s Day this year: “I am quite proud my career in track and field doesn't really have gender inequality, and I think that’s something that the whole world could have a look at.”\n\n7. Charli XCX\n\nIt was a Brat summer in 2024 thanks to British pop artist Charli XCX’s neon-green opus, a dance and electronic-influenced album Brat, which delved into themes of insecurity, jealousy, competitiveness and chaos as a woman in the 21st century. The singer born Charlotte Aitchison was arguably at her most vulnerable, in spite of the album’s bold and brash sound, in lyrics about wanting to party, to have kids, and the nature of celebrity.\n\nIts attitude was so compelling that it sparked an international trend, pushing back against “clean girl” influencers and championing a more hedonistic, independent attitude, co-opted by everyone from brands such as Snapchat and Ritz crackers to Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris in the US. The pioneering pop artist dominated this year’s Brit Awards with four out of five wins, including both Album and Artist of the Year.\n\n8. Cynthia Erivo\n\nCynthia Erivo’s mother had predicted her daughter’s stardom when she was an infant. Today, Erivo is enjoying the peak of her 15-year career, having recently starred as the green witch Elphaba in Jon M Chu’s acclaimed musical film Wicked. Throughout the past year, Erivo has delivered frank discussions about identity and fitting in during the Wicked press tour, in which she delivered countless moving interviews alongside her co-star Ariana Grande. “I think I was surprised by how connected I felt to Elphaba,” she said last year. “I understand what it feels like to be set apart from everybody else.” In a recent interview with Essence, she said: “The thing I hope that Black women and Black girls take away from this character is: You don’t necessarily have to wait for someone to see who you are to be celebrated.”\n\nErivo’s hard work – performing across the West End, then Broadway, and then making her film debut in 2018 – is paying off: she’s one of only a very few to be nominated for an EGOT (an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony Award).\n\n9. Tracey Emin\n\nFour years after receiving a cancer diagnosis with just a 33 per cent survival rate, Tracey Emin is still shaking up the art world with her raw, confessional work – earning her an obvious place in the top 10 after featuring in the list last year. Best known for My Bed and Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963-1995, the Turner Prize nominee, 61, delivered some of her most powerful pieces yet in I Followed You to the End at London’s White Cube, following Lover’s Grave in New York. Reflecting on life’s transformations, she told The Independent’s Geordie Greig: “I think we all change every seven years, and I feel in a new stage and am loving it – living each day like the last, grabbing life.”\n\n10. Julia Donaldson\n\nKnown for her much-loved books The Gruffalo, Room on the Broom and Stick Man, Julia Donaldson has enjoyed 25 years of literary success and become one of the most successful children’s authors of all time. In January this year, the former Children’s Laureate marked yet another impressive career milestone by supplanting Harry Potter author JK Rowling to become the UK’s top-selling author by volume, selling over two million more units than Rowling in the last 12 months.\n\n“I like to think I’ve got good moral principles, so they’re likely to come out in the writing,” she told The Independent of her didactic plot lines that have covered everything from lip-reading to bereavement. “The best thing about picture books is that they can be anything you like,” said Donaldson, who is a playwright and songwriter along with being a writer. “People have this idea that children are a peculiar race who like things that are different from what grown-ups like. Everyone likes a good, exciting story.”\n\n11. Stacey Solomon\n\nAged just 35, Stacey Solomon has become something of a national treasure, and so naturally features on the list again this year. She endeared herself to millions with her candid manner on shows such as Celebrity Gogglebox, Loose Women and, of course, The X Factor, which first propelled her to fame back in 2009. Her relatability is key to her success, whether breaking down in tears over a family’s heartbreaking tale on her BBC show Sort Your Life Out (which won a National Television Award in September 2024), or sharing easy but often quite ingenious tips for DIY and home improvement on social media.\n\nSolomon’s openness has been channelled into her advocacy for various issues that affect women and girls – from the stigma she faced as a single parent, to her powerful body positivity messages and her frankness about her struggle with post-natal depression and anxiety. She has also campaigned to end period poverty.\n\n12. Angela Rayner\n\nAs deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner is one of the most senior women in the Labour Party. After beginning her career as a care worker in Stockport Council, she eventually became a trade union representative within UNISON, during which time she joined Labour. In 2014, she was selected to contest Ashton‑under‑Lyne and was elected at the general election the following year – becoming the first woman MP in the constituency’s 180-year history. Having grown up on a council estate and had her first child, Ryan, at 16, Rayner has repeatedly spoken out about the misogyny and prejudice she has faced in her past as she fights to prevent others from going through the same.\n\nShe continues to face relentless and vicious attacks on social media, especially as a woman in politics, which has led Ryan to ask her if it was all worth it. “I told him we need people to step up, particularly women,” she recently told The Times. “Some are stepping down because of the abuse they get, and then we lose that representation. But – yes – I told him, absolutely it’s still worth it.” She has also spoken about her hopes that the Labour Party will have its first female leader, but says it’s “not just about having women in one place, and then ticking that box and saying we’ve done it”.\n\n13. Yulia Navalnaya\n\nYulia Navalnaya’s rise to become the unlikely new face of the Russian opposition is one marked by resolve and tragedy. It was not a role the mother-of-two chose for herself, but a position she inherited after her husband, Alexei Navalny, was killed in an Artic penal colony last February, following years of incarceration by Vladimir Putin. In an address in Munich just hours after Navalny’s death was first reported, she said: “I thought for a long time whether I should stand here before you or should I go back to my children? And then I thought: what would have Alexei done in my place? And I’m sure that he would have been standing here on this stage.”\n\nSince then she has toured the world, meeting world leaders and vowing to become Russia’s next president. She has taken over from the Russian opposition figure Gary Kasparov, the former chess grandmaster, as head of the US-based Human Rights Foundation. And, like all those fighting Putin, she has been designated an extremist and arrested in absentia. The Russian opposition is replete with widows – never before has it been led by one.\n\n14. Taylor Swift\n\nThe undisputed queen of pop, no musician had a bigger 2024 than Taylor Swift. Her globe-trotting Eras tour – 149 shows across five continents – shattered the record for the highest-grossing concert tour of all time, generating over $2 billion in ticket sales. She made history as the first solo artist to perform at London’s Wembley Stadium eight times on a single tour, performing to tens of thousands of fans each night. There was even an extraordinary story claiming fans danced so hard in Edinburgh that they set off earthquake monitors, according to the British Geological Survey (BGS), with seismic activity recorded up to six kilometres away.\n\nMeanwhile, the singer’s chart-dominating 11th studio album The Tortured Poets Department became the first to reach a billion Spotify streams in a single week, attracting critical praise and a few Grammy nominations along the way. Her charitable efforts have also increased, from her donation to foodbanks across the UK to the millions she gave towards hurricane relief efforts in America. In February, she was crowned global recording artist of the year for the fifth time by the IFP – yet another jewel in her already glittering crown.\n\n15. Chioma Nnadi\n\nThere were big velvet slippers to fill when it was announced that London-born journalist Chioma Nnadi would replace Edward Enninful after six years at the helm of British Vogue in 2023. The 45-year-old writer, formerly editor of the US edition’s website, became the first Black woman in Vogue’s 107-year history to edit the lauded fashion magazine. “Obviously what Edward did was incredible,” she said. “I'm only taking the conversation further.” When the fashion world decided thin was in again as Ozempic ran rampant in showbiz circles last year, Nnadi boldly called out the resurgence of Nineties body ideals. “We should all be concerned,” she said. “Often these things are treated like a trend, and we don’t want them to be.”\n\nSince the start of her reign, Nnadi has released issues fronted by fresh talent including Grammy-winner SZA, British musician FKA twigs, and, most recently, South African megastar vocalist Tyla. “I didn’t see women who looked like me on the pages of the magazine,” Nnadi reflected ahead of her takeover. “Now I feel lucky to be coming on when that is so much a natural part of the conversation.” She told The Independent for International Women’s Day this year: “We think about fashion as being essentially a women’s industry, but yet when you look at all the heads of these creative houses, often they’re men who are the creative directors – so I think it’s important that we champion women’s voices in the industry and push for change.”\n\n16. Emma Grede\n\nWhen business mogul Emma Grede dropped out of university because she couldn’t afford the fees, she was armed with nothing but an unwavering work ethic, a gift for negotiating and an entrepreneurial instinct. Aged 26, she turned her interest in fashion into a multimillion-dollar fortune with the launch of talent and marketing agency ITB and she features on the list for a second year running. The now 42-year-old has since become a founding partner of Kim Kardashian’s multibillion-dollar shapewear empire Skims and the size-inclusive denim brand The Good American.\n\nAside from her lucrative ties with the Kardashian clan, Grede has become a trailblazer in the world of entrepreneurship in her own right. Last year, she became the first Black woman to serve as an investor on the popular ABC series Shark Tank (the US version of Dragons’ Den), and she serves as chairwoman of 15 Percent Pledge, a non-profit that urges retailers to dedicate 15 per cent of their budgets to Black-owned businesses. “I realised, really early on, that being a Black woman, being somebody who didn’t go to university, and seeing things the way I do was an advantage for me in business,” she said in an interview with the Financial Times. “That was part of my superpower.”\n\n17. Afua Kyei\n\nAfua Kyei was one of the first ethnic minority women to rise to one of the top jobs at the Bank of England when she became its first Black executive and youngest executive director at the age of 36. She said her inspiration for success came from a headmistress who believed in her and her hard-working parents – her father was awarded a scholarship by the government of Ghana to study in the UK after coming 3rd in West Africa for his A-Levels and her mother worked for the NHS for 40 years.\n\nA vocal proponent of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), which is currently under attack, particularly under the Trump presidency in the US, she said in a speech last year: “What I would like to see more than anything, is for diverse people to be fully accepted and valued when they are ordinary, not just when they are exceptional. That’s when we’ll know we are really moving society forward.” She told The Independent for International Women’s Day: “We need to destigmatise men taking time off work to share in caring responsibilities… We also need to make sure we encourage women to take on leadership roles.”\n\n18. Jess Phillips\n\nFrom her work at domestic abuse charity Women’s Aid to her role as safeguarding minister in parliament, Jess Phillips has spent most of her career defending women – summed up by her decision to stand up in the House of Commons each year and name every woman killed by a man in the past 12 months to raise awareness of the violence against women and girls epidemic. As safeguarding minister, she has played a pivotal role in the government’s crackdown on drink spiking, as well as the creation of a new criminal offence over making intimate deepfake images.\n\nBut her government position has also seen her become the target of abuse and harassment herself. At the beginning of 2025, she received a barrage of online attacks – spurred on by tech billionaire Elon Musk – after she rejected a national inquiry into the child grooming gangs scandal. In an interview at the time, Phillips said: \"The only thing I ever want to be doing is being able to use all of my brain power to focus on the hundreds of girls I have supported over the years, who have been victims of grooming gangs.” She told The Independent on International Women’s Day: “When we stop having to do all that micro work about when we’re going to get home, what we’re going to wear – that’s what gender equality looks like to me, ease for women just to be who they are and feel free.”\n\n19. Emily Damari\n\nBritish-Israeli national Emily Damari spent 471 days in Hamas captivity in the Gaza Strip before being released on 19 January this year. The Tottenham Hotspurs fan was the only Briton taken hostage by Hamas. Her mother, Mandy Damari, who was born in Surrey and grew up in Beckenham, south-east London, has praised her daughter’s resilience. On 7 October 2023, Hamas gunmen attacked Emily’s family’s home in Kibbutz Kfar Azar in southern Israel, killing her dog and shooting her in the hand and leg. The militiamen then blindfolded her, bundled her into her car and drove her back into Gaza. She was then denied medical attention despite losing two fingers in the shooting.\n\nWhen the 28-year-old was released in the first swap of the latest, fragile ceasefire agreement, she signed off her first Instagram message with a “rock on” emoji in an apparent reference to the fingers she lost during her ordeal. She said she had “come back to life” upon her release.\n\n20. Adejoké Bakare\n\nOn paper, it might look like Adejoké Bakare never planned on running a restaurant. She studied microbiology, worked in property and cooked for friends on the side. But in 2019, she entered the Brixton Kitchen competition, won the amateur category and found herself at the helm of Chishuru, a West African restaurant in Brixton Village that quickly became one of London’s most exciting dining spots. Success came fast, but it wasn’t easy. As demand grew, Bakare closed the doors in 2022 to hunt for a bigger space, crowdfunding her way into Soho. In 2024, she made history as the first Black woman in Britain to win a Michelin star – an accolade that cemented what diners already knew: her food is exceptional.\n\nBeyond the kitchen, she has also been vocal about industry-wide change. When Jason Atherton claimed sexism wasn’t an issue in restaurant kitchens, Bakare was among 70 female chefs who signed an open letter to set the record straight. “A lot of these things have been going on for years and there’s been no change,” Bakare told The Independent, as she called for hospitality venues and the industry as a whole to do an “MOT… to check and see what things are in place to serve everybody equally”.\n\n21. Carla Denyer\n\nCarla Denyer had two electoral victories to celebrate on election night last year. Not only had the Green Party co-leader pulled off its best-ever general election performance, jumping from one MP to four, she was personally responsible for one of the night’s biggest upsets. The 39-year-old left-winger capitalised on anger at Keir Starmer’s stance on the war in Gaza to unseat the then-shadow culture secretary Thangam Debbonaire. The MP for Bristol Central has since used her voice in parliament, and her party’s swelled ranks on the green benches, to pile pressure on Labour from the left, continuing to speak out in support of Gaza, calling for the implementation of rent controls and the introduction of a wealth tax.\n\nAs a queer woman, she has also described fighting for LGBTQ+ rights as a key issue for her personally and has been vocal in pushing for equality for trans people. Speaking to The Independent for International Women’s Day, Denyer said: “To get gender equality we need gender equity – the difference is that equality is giving everyone the same, whereas equity is recognising that we’re all in different situations.” She has her sights set on May’s local elections in 2025, when she is hoping to build on the Green Party’s 810-strong army of local councillors.\n\n22. Dame Sarah Storey\n\nBy any objective measure, Dame Sarah Storey might be Great Britain’s greatest sportsperson. In September, she won her 18th and 19th Paralympic gold medals at Paris 2024, with the latter in the road race coming almost 32 years to the day since she celebrated her first at Barcelona 1992. With 30 Paralympics medals in total, the 47-year-old boasts a medal haul and longevity at the elite level that few other British athletes can match.\n\nAnd yet, Storey remains largely unknown to the public, which she believes is down to a lack of exposure for para-sport. Despite a glittering trophy cabinet, she has continued to fight for a level playing field for para-athletes, using her platform to pressure decision-makers into improving the visibility of para-sport outside of the Paralympics. Already an undisputed champion of two disciplines – with swimming as well as cycling in her illustrious career – she has not ruled out competing at the Los Angeles Games in 2028.\n\n23. Layla Moran\n\nElected as MP for Oxford West and Abingdon in 2017, Layla Moran is the first MP of Palestinian descent. The Liberal Democrat MP, who had family in Gaza following the outbreak of the conflict with Israel, has been vocal in calling for an immediate ceasefire over the last 18 months, drawing attention to the plight of the women and children affected by the war.\n\nThe chair of the health and social care select committee has also been outspoken about women’s rights during her time in parliament, including highlighting the abuse female MPs face. She has continued to campaign for a crackdown on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after hearing they were being used to silence survivors of sexual assault at universities, with the bill she tabled currently passing through the Commons. Calling for gender inequalities to be measured and followed up with action, she told The Independent: “We absolutely need to focus on this and the reason is it’s good for everybody.”\n\nRAYE’s battle with her former record label Polydor sparked an industry-wide debate, not least over the way women’s careers are frequently sidelined when they dare to speak up. She makes the list again this year as her star continues to climb ever higher. The singer’s triumph at the 2024 Brit Awards, where she took home a record-breaking six prizes for her critically adored debut My 21st Century Blues, was to many a fairytale story, one that has only continued in the months since. She was nominated for Best New Artist at the 2025 Grammys, and while she didn’t win, she used the opportunity to demonstrate her phenomenal talents to an audience of stars including Beyoncé, Taylor Swift (whom she supported during the London dates of her Eras tour), Sabrina Carpenter and Billie Eilish.\n\nFew British artists have successfully “broken” the US, but RAYE’s crossover potential is evident in her recent Top 20 single “Born Again”, a collaboration with rapper Doja Cat and BLACKPINK singer Lisa loaded with Hollywood glamour.\n\n25. Jameela Jamil\n\nJameela Jamil may have found fame on screen in The Good Place and Love at First Sight, but it’s her activism that has truly propelled her into the spotlight, with her featuring on the influence list again this year. In 2024, she opened up about how her teenage battle with an eating disorder “destroyed” her bone density, damaging her kidney, liver, digestive system, and heart. Her raw honesty resonated with her 3.7 million Instagram followers, as she continued to use her I Weigh movement – founded in 2018 – to challenge unrealistic beauty standards and promote the idea that people’s worth is defined by their achievements, not the number on the scales.\n\n26. Mishal Husain\n\nMishal Husain’s departure from the BBC in the new year marked the end of an era – it was a huge loss for the broadcaster, as well as for a nation that had grown accustomed to her calm voice delivering probing interviews through the airwaves six days a week. After 27 years with the corporation, 11 of those at the helm of its flagship current affairs programme Today, the 52-year-old certainly went out with a bang, with last year marking one of her biggest yet.\n\nMost memorably, she led the BBC’s general election coverage in the summer, including fronting the high-stakes leader debate. The presenter also released her book Broken Threads: My Family From Empire to Independence last year, which tells the stories of her grandparents in the new state of Pakistan and became a Sunday Times bestseller. Having left what BBC News’ CEO called an “incredible journalistic legacy” at the broadcaster – which has included her longtime advocacy of gender and race equality in the media – Husain is set to launch a global interview series with her new employer Bloomberg.\n\n27. Kate Winslet\n\nThere are few names in Hollywood that exude as much gravitas as Kate Winslet. As a young star, the Reading-born actor forged a career in the fires of industry misogyny, flinging doors open for women behind her as she starred in films as iconic and diverse as Titanic, The Holiday, The Reader, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Along the way, Winslet has called out body-shaming and bullying, refusing to be airbrushed in editorials and flatout declining to thank Harvey Weinstein in her 2009 Oscars speech – a whole eight years before the disgraced producer was held accountable for his actions. Plus, she’s also simply a brilliant actor.\n\nLast year, Winslet gave a magnetic, gritty, commanding performance as Lee Millier in Lee, speaking out about the “appalling” Titanic-era body-shamers during the film’s promotion. This year, Winslet is set to make her first dive into directing with contemporary family drama Goodbye June.\n\n28. The Queen\n\nThe Queen features among the year’s most influential women again this year after being at the forefront of the royal family in 2024 as the King took a step back following his cancer diagnosis. A longtime advocate for helping victims of domestic abuse, Camilla continued to spotlight the voices of survivors this year. In November, she released her first documentary feature since ascending the throne, which followed her as she attended official engagements and never-before-seen private meetings with survivors and campaigners of domestic abuse.\n\nThe Queen also backed The Independent’s campaign to build two safe homes for women fleeing violence. She has met survivors of abuse across the globe, including in Samoa. There, she visited the Samoa Victims Support Group (SVSG) and toured a campus where up to 100 abused children are given care and an education, while domestic abuse survivors receive support and counselling.\n\n29. Nicola Coughlan\n\nIn the past year, Nicola Coughlan has spread her wings well beyond her breakout role as melodramatic teen Clare in Derry Girls. The Irish star made waves with Channel 4’s Big Mood, with a visceral turn as a woman navigating life with bipolar disorder. And after years in the corseted ensemble cast of Bridgerton, she became the star of the Netflix mega-hit. Her character Penelope Featherington moved front and centre to become the series’ romantic lead, a move she called “empowering”. “There’s one scene where I’m very naked on camera, and that was my idea, my choice,” she said in one interview. “It just felt like the biggest ‘f*** you’ to all the conversation surrounding my body.”\n\n30. Imane Khelif\n\nImane Khelif was dignified and defiant in the boxing ring even as her historic gold medal at the Paris Olympics was overshadowed by a gender row that, for a few days, became the biggest story in the world. The Algerian continues to fight against what she calls “false and offensive” allegations against her, with the International Boxing Association (IBA) filing a legal complaint over its claim that she failed a gender eligibility test at the 2022 World Championships. Khelif was one of two women boxers – along with Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting – cleared to compete in Paris by the International Olympic Committee, who said the IBA’s tests could not be relied upon.\n\nAmid the spotlight and scrutiny she faced, as well as false reports that she was transgender and intersex, Khelif’s victory was an inspirational moment for women and girls in Algeria, leading to a surge of participation at amateur boxing clubs and a transformation of societal norms. Khelif responded to the IBA’s legal challenge by stating: “For two years, I have taken the high road while my name and image have been used, unauthorised, to further personal and political agendas through the spreading and dissemination of baseless lies and misinformation. But silence is no longer an option.”\n\n31. Cathy Newman\n\nCathy Newman broke one of the major stories of the year as well as unusually becoming her own case study in a story that had a deep personal impact. The Channel 4 News presenter’s eight-year investigation into abuse by John Smyth – who is now known as the Church of England’s most prolific serial abuser – triggered the church’s worst crisis of modern times, which included Justin Welby’s resignation from his position as Archbishop of Canterbury in November. The following month, Newman was sitting down to confront a “haunting” video in which her face had been superimposed onto pornography after colleagues stumbled across it during research for an investigation into deepfakes. As the issue only worsens into 2025, the 50-year-old is advocating for urgent action to be taken against those who weaponise AI against women and girls.\n\nHer reporting continues to shine a spotlight on issues that especially affect women and girls, not least in her extensive coverage of sexual harassment, which has included allegations made within Westminster. Speaking to The Independent for International Women’s Day, she cited Afghanistan and Gaza as she called on people to remember: “When you look around the world actually, women’s equality is going backwards in many countries.”\n\n32. Tasha Ghouri\n\nTasha Ghouri first won fans as the first ever deaf contestant to appear on ITV’s Love Island, but it was her performance on Strictly Come Dancing last autumn that really struck a chord. Her dancing on the series blew judges away, and she made it all the way to the final, eventually coming runner up. While on the show, she scored the first 10s of the season, and moved many fans when she opened up about the ableist abuse she had experienced since being in the public eye. She also hosts the podcast Superpowers with Tasha and released the book Hits Different last June, about a deaf girl who is an aspiring dancer and goes on tour with a global superstar.\n\nSpeaking to The Independent for International Women’s Day, Ghouri called for teaching on gender equality to begin at a young age. “I think it should start in schools, that’s a pivotal time,” she said, adding that both girls and boys should be a part of the conversation.\n\n33. Lily Allen and Miquita Oliver\n\nLongtime friends Lily Allen and Miquita Oliver, already successful in their own right, launched the brilliant podcast Miss Me? last year. Airing twice weekly, it connects with listeners thanks largely to the intimate nature of the conversations: pop star and actor Allen, 39, and TV host Oliver, 40, have been friends since childhood, growing up together in west London. Topics are wide-ranging, too, covering their mutual struggles as women in the spotlight, relationship woes, eating disorders, social media, art and politics. Just like best friends, or sisters, they don’t always get on, allowing listeners to witness those occasional disagreements or moments of frisson, while they openly admit their jealousy for one another in childhood, for different reasons. But above all, Miss Me? offers a rare window into female friendships, in all their complicated, messy, brilliant glory.\n\n34. Alex Consani\n\nAlex Consani represents the “duality of woman” to her admirers. Strutting down the runway for the world’s biggest fashion houses, including Versace and Alexander McQueen, she switches effortlessly to being the goofiest girlie on the New York subway to her millions of TikTok followers. The 21-year-old shot to fame during the Covid-19 pandemic and is the world’s first transgender woman to be named Model of the Year at the annual Fashion Awards in London in 2024, as well as one of the first to walk the runway for Victoria’s Secret.\n\nShe came out as trans aged eight and underwent hormone replacement therapy, having dressed as a girl since the age of four. Her parents – a water conservation expert mother who she describes as a “Slavic European diva”, and a dad who works with Guide Dogs for the Blind – supported her by sending her to a trans summer camp. Consani is a vocal activist for causes including Palestine. Her other work includes appearances in music videos Okay by JT, and 360 by Charli XCX.\n\n35. Emma Barnett\n\nEmma Barnett ascended to the helm of the BBC’s flagship current affairs programme Today last year, following three years of presenting Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour. The 40-year-old has brought her sharp intelligence, assuredness and fearlessness in challenging guests with her. Highlights include her heart wrenching interview with Caroline Darian, the daughter of Gisèle Pelicot, and a hilarious conversation in bed with comedian Miranda Hart.\n\nBarnett has continued to shine a spotlight on women’s health, opening up about her personal struggle with endometriosis and how it led to a difficult IVF journey before she became a mother. Her new book Maternity Service: A Love Letter to Mothers from the Front Line of Maternity Leave is set to be released later this month and is inspired by her own experiences, coming after her first book Period: It's about Bloody Time was published in 2019.\n\n36. Molly-Mae Hague\n\nMolly-Mae Hague won hearts in 2024 as she navigated the shock end of her five-year relationship with fellow Love Island alum Tommy Fury just a year after their engagement – which has continued to dominate headlines even now. While she rose to fame on the reality show, her success is entirely her own, from her tenure as PrettyLittleThing’s creative director to launching her own fake tan company, Filter by Molly-Mae.\n\nIn 2024, she proved herself to be more than just an influencer: enigmatic as she handled heartbreak with grace, aspirational as she built on her entrepreneurial success, and somehow still the relatable ‘girl next door’ to millions. She launched her long-awaited fashion brand Maebe in 2024, while her hugely popular documentary Molly-Mae: Behind It All first aired in January this year. Meanwhile, the star has managed to amass nine million followers on Instagram – and counting.\n\n37. Leah Williamson\n\nThe Lionesses captain has made a successful return to the pitch for club and country after the serious knee injury that forced her to miss the Women’s World Cup. Since then, Leah Williamson has stepped back into the leadership role for England and Arsenal that has helped both teams stand at the forefront of the growth of women’s football. Williamson’s ability to clearly communicate the message behind the Lionesses’ journey and aims, as they look to inspire and create societal change for women and girls, will be key again as the team seek to win a second consecutive Euros title in Switzerland this summer.\n\nAs the first women’s footballer to address the UN – which she did during her injury lay-off as she shared her experience of helping refugees through Save the Children x the Arsenal Foundation’s Coaching for Life programme – Williamson understands her role off the pitch is as important as her defensive duties on it.\n\nIn a call for action on tackling gender inequality in football, Williamson told The Independent: “I think right now we're at a dangerous point, because people want to be perceived as promoting the game, but actually what they're doing isn't matching up to that. So I think actions aren't matching words at the minute...\n\n“What you hope is that the people in power are the ones who do what’s right in those circumstances and push in the direction that we think we’ve been travelling in, because any progress, regardless of how slow it is, is a win. We cannot go backwards.”\n\n38. Debbie Crosbie\n\nAs CEO of Nationwide Building Society, Debbie Crosbie led the completion of the biggest UK merger in the industry since the global financial crisis with the £2.9 billion takeover of Virgin Money in March 2024. Under her stewardship, Nationwide has also pledged not to close branches for a further three years, unlike many other banks and building societies. Crosbie is a powerful presence in the energy networks sphere as a non-executive director of SSE – and she features on the influence list again this year.\n\nShe is also a leading advocate for nurturing women leaders in business. In asking for staff at Nationwide to return to the workplace on a hybrid basis, Ms Crosbie cited the importance of ensuring women did not miss out on opportunities to progress, while balancing responsibilities at home. \n\n39. Leanne Pero\n\nLeanne Pero founded her dance company, the Movement Factory, at just 15 years old – but her life was changed forever in 2016 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of only 30. After that, she set up the Leanne Pero Foundation, with the mission of offering help and support to women cancer sufferers in the Black community and dispelling unhelpful myths and taboos. Her own diagnosis was down to chance, she has said – a pattern she wants to change. As part of her campaigning work, which she has described as dedicating her life to since her diagnosis, she has travelled to West Africa with the Churchill Fellowship to research misconceptions around breast cancer among the Black community there.\n\n40. Sophie Willan\n\nComedian Sophie Willan grew up in and out of the care system and channelled these experiences into material for stand-up routines and her multi-BAFTA-winning BBC comedy series Alma’s Not Normal. The 37-year-old has been praised by the care community for giving the upbringing visibility on screen in a series that could have been pigeonholed as a tragedy but was instead menacingly funny. “I really wanted to educate people on empathy,” Willan said of the series, which has since been shown in universities to students studying social work. Her work has also explored themes of feminism, class and northern identity.\n\nLast year, the comedian appeared on the seventeenth series of the panel show Taskmaster and was heralded as one of the best contestants of all time. She also starred in the BBC detective dramedy Ludwig alongside David Mitchell and Anna Maxwell Martin, which was commissioned for a second series after an impressive 9.5 million views. Willan told The Independent of her success: “It’s all about making sure we’re telling stories that we don’t see on our screens but that should be on our screens.”\n\n41. Zoe Kalar\n\nIt has been a tough, complicated, divisive and often plain bad time for social networks and the people who rely on them. Tech entrepreneur Zoe Kalar has taken that as a challenge, launching WeAre8 – what she called the \"People's Platform\" – with a view to making today's internet benefit those who actually use it. To do so, she has overseen the founding of an emerging social network platform that is built on actually showing people content made by those people they choose to follow. But maybe even more importantly, that comes with a commitment to share revenue back with the creators who made the content in the first place. Her hope is that the new platform will not just highlight the work of people who might otherwise not be able to share their story but reward them for doing so, both financially and by getting rid of the abuse and division that has characterised the big social media platforms. Launched in 2022, WeAre8 already has 1.5 million monthly active users in the UK and 3 million globally.\n\n42. Jilly Cooper\n\nJilly Cooper was a household name before 2024, but the release of Disney’s adaptation of her 1988 novel Rivals sparked a surge of interest around her reputation as queen of the bonkbuster. The TV series starring David Tennant, Aidan Turner, Alex Hassell, Katherine Parkinson, Danny Dyer and Nafessa Williams got everything right, from the class warfare to outrageous outfits and Eighties excess. It was the escapism we needed, but as showrunner Dominic Treadwell-Collins knew all too well, there are plenty of important issues at its heart. “Everyone said, ‘Jilly Cooper, oh, it’s a bit silly,’” he said, recalling the reaction from TV executives when he first pitched the idea of a series.\n\nIt was a classic case of the sexism and snobbery that has seen Cooper’s work dismissed as “chick lit”, frivolous fluff for women. Those views are thankfully outdated: in 2017, Cooper was the subject of a lengthy appreciation in the London Review of Books by Cambridge academic Dr Ian Patterson, who compared Cooper’s world-building skills to novelists such as Charlies Dickens and Anthony Trollope. Hats off to her.\n\n43. Saoirse Ronan\n\nAlmost two decades on from her intense breakout performance in Atonement, Saoirse Ronan has been enjoying the best year of her career. From her heart-wrenching turn as the mother of an evacuee in Blitz to her bruising tour de force as a recovering alcoholic in The Outrun, the Irish actor has been serving up some of the most memorable cinematic performances of the past 12 months.\n\nShe’s also made a splash on the small screen – her appearance on The Graham Norton Show in October made headlines when she delivered an honest reminder about violence against women and girls. A true heroine, even when she’s off-duty.\n\n44. Hetti Barkworth-Nanton\n\nHetti Barkworth-Nanton has enjoyed a hugely successful career in the financial and commercial world – but it is her campaign work in aiding survivors of domestic abuse that saw her awarded a CBE. As the CEO at Ploughshare, Barkworth-Nanton oversees an organisation that helps turn Ministry of Defence-developed ideas into viable commercial opportunities.\n\nAs chair of the board at the charity Refuge, the largest provider of specialist domestic abuse services in the country, Barkworth-Nanton is a powerful voice and presence in the fight to eradicate violence at home. A tireless campaigner, she received a CBE for services to people affected by domestic abuse in November and a Special Recognition at the Pride of Britain awards. Ms Barkworth-Nanton also endorsed The Independent’s Brick-by-Brick campaign in conjunction with Refuge – which saw more than £576,000 raised to build two safe houses for domestic abuse survivors and their children.\n\n45. Charlotte Hill\n\nCharlotte Hill is at the head of revolutionary food poverty charity The Felix Project, which rescues surplus food from farms, supermarkets and restaurants and turns it into meals. As CEO, Ms Hill has overseen an extra special year that saw the King visit twice as part of the charity’s participation in The Coronation Food Project, an initiative set up to mark Charles’s 75th birthday. \n\nFrom their four depots in London, The Felix Project distributes millions of meals to charities, who get them into the hands of those who need them most. In 2024, they gave out the equivalent of 38 million meals to 1,200 community organisations, rescuing almost 16,000 tonnes of surplus food from going to waste.\n\n46. Zoe Ball\n\nFor Zoe Ball, 2024 marked the end of an era as she stepped down from The Radio 2 Breakfast Show five years after taking over from Chris Evans. A staple of Britain’s morning routine, Ball became one of the BBC’s most recognisable voices – and, in 2024, was revealed as the corporation’s second-highest-paid presenter after Gary Lineker. Signing off on her final day, the 54-year-old reflected: “It’s been such a gift to do the show, to follow in the footsteps of Terry [Wogan] and Steve [Wright]. It’s been a privilege to be the first [woman] to present the show... remember girls, you can do anything.”\n\n47. Dame Sue Carr\n\nIn October 2023, Dame Sue Carr became the first woman named as the most senior judge in England and Wales. She said it was a great privilege to be sworn in as Lady Chief Justice in front of the justice secretary, senior judges and leaders of the legal profession at the Royal Courts of Justice. “I do not underestimate the challenges that lie ahead, and I look forward to approaching the role with energy, enthusiasm, and positivity,” she said. As the 98th person to take up the powerful role – which dates back to the 13th century – she is the first woman to do so, after taking over from outgoing Lord Justice Burnett.\n\nLady Carr became a barrister in 1987 and took silk in 2003. She held a number of senior roles during her career as a lawyer, including chair of the Bar Standards Board conduct committee and complaints commissioner to the International Criminal Court in the Hague. She became a criminal judge in 2009 and a High Court judge in 2013, before being appointed a Lady Justice of Appeal in 2020.\n\n48. Debbie Jevans\n\nDebbie Jevans is the first woman chair of the All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club, taking on one of the most powerful and prestigious positions in British sport when she succeeded Ian Hewitt to oversee the running of Wimbledon last year. Jevans, a former player who retired at just 23, is no stranger to sports governance and was the director of sport for London 2012’s organising committee and chief executive of the 2015 Rugby World Cup. She is set to serve as AELTC chair at a pivotal time for the Championships, as Wimbledon looks to expand its grounds onto the adjacent Wimbledon Park Golf Club following a controversial planning process and amid disputes with local residents. The 64-year-old also wants Wimbledon, an event steeped in pomp and tradition, to embrace the future – the scrapping of line judges after 147 years of line-calling technology may just be the start.\n\n49. Aung San Suu Kyi\n\nAs the democratically elected leader of Myanmar who has spent most of the last four years jailed in solitary confinement, Aung San Suu Kyi has become one of the world’s most controversial figures. She has dedicated her life to the fight for democracy in her country, putting Myanmar ahead of her family, spending nearly 15 years under house arrest and being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in the process. But the 79-year-old fell from favour after failing to speak out on her country’s extreme violence against its Rohingya Muslim minority and defending the Myanmar military at the International Court of Justice in the Hague in 2019.\n\nJust two years later, she was imprisoned by that same junta and continues to be held behind bars. World leaders have continued to call for her release, with UK foreign secretary David Lammy praising her last month as the “only legitimate leader of her country” and urging Myanmar’s military dictatorship to free her. Responding to Independent TV’s documentary Cancelled: The Rise and Fall of Aung San Suu Kyi, human rights campaigner Bianca Jagger and Wild Swans author Jung Chang joined politicians, journalists and lawyers in calling for her freedom, describing her as the “last hope” for the people of her country.\n\n50. Amanda Pritchard\n\nAmanda Pritchard became the first woman to hold the top job in the 70-year history of the NHS when she was appointed chief executive of NHS England in 2021, marking a significant moment for women and girls across the country. Last year, the 49-year-old launched a major overhaul of the health service, announcing “radical” plans to cut waiting lists and improve patient care amid the exceptionally high demands of winter 2024. Ms Pritchard announced in February that she will step down from her role at the end of March, after coming under intense scrutiny in recent months. She said it had been a \"hugely difficult decision” to stand aside and “an enormous privilege to lead the NHS in England through what has undoubtedly been the most difficult period in its history”.\n\nReporting for The Independent’s 2025 Influence List by: Tara Cobham, Caroline Gammell, Chloe Hubbard, Millie Cooke, Ellie Harrison, Jamie Braidwood, David Maddox, Archie Mitchell, Roisin O'Connor, Annabel Nugent, Athena Stavrou, Tom Watling, Lydia Spencer-Elliot, Ellie Muir, Bryony Gooch, Howard Mustoe, Hannah Twiggs, Maira Butt, Karl Matchett, Andrew Griffin, Holly Bancroft, Amy-Clare Martin, Alexander Butler, Liam James, Melissa Cross, Eliza Ketcher, Olivia Foster","summary":"Marking International Women’s Day for a third year running, The Independent has compiled a list of the 50 most influential women across the worlds of politics, sports, the arts, media, business, fashion and activism – all united by their extraordinary impact on UK women’s lives","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/international-womens-day-independent-influence-list-b2706045.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/06/9/48/indylead-iwd-comp-copy.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/TTh8ijyh-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-06 18:00:14","author":"Independent Staff","authors":["Independent Staff"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.541},{"id":297447204,"title":"Veterans fired from federal jobs say they feel betrayed, including some who voted for Trump","text":"By BRIAN WITTE, Associated Press\n\nNathan Hooven is a disabled Air Force veteran who voted for Donald Trump in November. Barely three months later, he’s now unemployed and says he feels betrayed by the president’s dramatic downsizing of the federal government that cost him his job.\n\n“I think a lot of other veterans voted the same way, and we have been betrayed,” said Hooven, who was fired in February from a Virginia medical facility for veterans. “I feel like my life and the lives of so many like me, so many that have sacrificed so much for this country, are being destroyed.”\n\nThe mass firing of federal employees since Trump took office in January is pushing out veterans who make up 30% of the nation’s federal workforce. The exact number of veterans who have lost their job is unknown, although House Democrats last month estimated that it was potentially in the thousands.\n\nMore could be on the way. The Department of Veterans Affairs — a major employer of veterans — is planning a reorganization that includes cutting over 80,000 jobs from the sprawling agency, according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press. Veterans represent more than 25% of the VA’s workforce.\n\nIn interviews, several veterans who supported candidates of both parties described their recent job losses as a betrayal of their military service. They are particularly angered by how it happened: in an email that cited inadequate job performance — despite, they say, receiving positive reviews in their roles.\n\nJames Stancil, a 62-year-old Army veteran who was fired last month from his job as a supply technician at a VA hospital in Milwaukee, said it felt like he’d been shot and dumped out of a helicopter.\n\n“And you just free fall and hit the ground — that’s it,” said Stancil, who supported Democrat Kamala Harris last year. “I’m not dead weight. You’re tossing off the wrong stuff.”\n\nStancil said the email he received telling him his performance wasn’t good enough came as “a complete shock” because he had previously received positive feedback. Hooven also said his performance was cited despite similarly positive feedback during his 11 months as a probationary employee.\n\n“I’ve been blindsided,” Hooven said. “My life has been completely upended with zero chance to prepare. I was fired without notice, unjustly, based on a lie that I’m a subpar, poor performer at my job.”\n\nStancil said he believes Trump owes fired veterans an apology.\n\nAsked this week about fired federal workers who are veterans, Alina Habba, a former member of Trump’s personal legal team who now serves as a counselor in the White House, defended the cuts.\n\n“But at the same time, we have taxpayer dollars, we have a fiscal responsibility to use taxpayer dollars to pay people that actually work,” Habba told reporters. “That doesn’t mean that we forget our veterans, by any means. We are going to care for them in the right way. But perhaps they’re not fit to have a job at this moment, or not willing to come to work.”\n\nVeterans were much likelier to support Trump than Harris in November’s presidential election, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of the American electorate conducted in all 50 states. Nearly 6 in 10 voters who are veterans backed Trump, while about 4 in 10 voted for Harris.\n\nCynthia Williams, an Army veteran who lost her job as a dispatcher at a VA in Ann Arbor, Michigan, said she didn’t vote for either candidate but suspects fellow veterans who backed Trump might have changed their minds had they known this was coming.\n\n“It was blindsiding, because he said he wanted to make the country great again … but this is not making it great again,” Williams said.\n\nMatthew Sims, an Army veteran, lost his job last month as a program support assistant at a mental health clinic at a VA in Salem, Virginia, after moving with his wife and three children from Texas. He voted for Trump and said he supports reducing the size of the federal government but not this way.\n\n“I support downsizing, but it’s just the way they’re going about doing it.

He said he feels scared, numb and angry.\n\n“I cried,” Evans said about learning of his firing. “I haven’t done that in a while, because you’re just kind of free falling now.

The poster described Tesla as “The Swasticar,” alongside an image of Musk making what appears to be a Nazi salute while riding in a Tesla.

He then turned and performed the same salute to the American flag.\n\nElon Musk denied that his gesture was a fascist salute. “Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The ‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is so tired,” he wrote on X. \n\nIn an interview earlier this month, the group told The Hollywood Reporter that the incident at Trump’s inauguration gave them the impetus they needed. “OK, Elon, if you’re going to show the world who you are, let’s show the world who Tesla really is,” a spokesperson told THR, adding that the car company’s business is where the public can best vote against the tech mogul.\n\nEHE’s campaign has also seen “swasticar” stickers slapped on Teslas. The group have even taken to attacking Musk’s X platform, with a poster that reads: “Delete your account. If the bar lets Nazis in, it’s a Nazi bar”.\n\nEveryone Hates Elon’s fundraiser, the People Versus Elon, is on track to make £150,000 ($190,000) by next year. They’re also active on sites like Crowdfunder.co.uk.\n\nCriticism of Elon Musk has been gradually growing in volume, fuelled by the actions taken by his controversial government department, DOGE (the Department Of Government Efficiency), including closing down USAID. USAID is the world’s largest provider of food assistance. Its entire website is offline at the time of writing.\n\nUSAID leaders fought against the decision, warning Trump in memos that the closure of the agency would mean a million children will go untreated for severe malnutrition, up to 166,000 people will die from malaria and 200,000 more children will be paralyzed by polio. The programmes were cut anyway, reports ProPublica. This week, people on social media ridiculed a resurfaced 2021 photo of Elon Musk, joking that “he looks like a non-binary barista” (among other things) because of his unusual hair cut.\n\nAlso, over the weekend, a caricature of the billionaire featured on a carnival float at a German parade, where he was depicted wearing a nappy, holding a swastika flag and carrying a poo-filled megaphone.\n\nShare your thoughts!

Dubbed the \"Tesla Takedown,\" the protest campaign aims to pressure Musk by encouraging people to boycott Tesla products, divest from the company, and picket at Tesla showrooms.According to Reuters, the movement has emerged amid public frustration over job losses at federal agencies, many of which have been linked to Musk’s role in the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Critics argue that Musk’s influence over federal restructuring poses ethical concerns, while his supporters claim he is necessary for eliminating government inefficiencies. The protests, though still in their early stages, reflect the increasing politicization of Musk’s business empire and the backlash against his collaboration with the Trump administration.Elon Musk faces backlash as activists launch 'Tesla Takedown' protestsThe \"Tesla Takedown\" movement gained traction this week as protesters gathered outside Tesla dealerships across the United States. In Portland, Oregon, around 350 demonstrators chanted slogans against Musk while urging people to sell their Tesla vehicles and divest from the company.One of the lead organizers, Carolanne Fry, emphasized the goal of making Tesla a \"toxic brand\" to weaken Musk’s financial influence. \"Every economic angle that we can attack Elon is for the best,\" she stated, calling on institutions, including state retirement funds, to divest their Tesla holdings.While the protests remain relatively small, they signal a broader pushback against the Trump administration's job cuts, particularly among Democratic voters who feel their party leaders have not responded forcefully enough.Elon Musk’s role in government workforce cutsElon Musk has been instrumental in implementing sweeping reductions to the federal workforce through his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). His team has overseen the termination of thousands of federal employees and the cancellation of contracts at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which funds global humanitarian programs.Critics argue that Musk's direct access to federal agencies represents an overreach of power for an unelected business leader. They also raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as Musk's companies—including Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink—could benefit from government restructuring. His supporters, however, claim his aggressive approach is necessary to streamline what they view as an overly bureaucratic federal system.Economic and political impact on TeslaTesla has long been associated with progressive values, particularly in the realm of environmental sustainability. However, Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration and his cost-cutting efforts have alienated some former supporters. For many protesters, Tesla has become a symbol of the administration’s policies, making it a prime target for activism.Carlo Voli, an interpreter from Washington state, described the campaign’s strategy: \"The idea is to tarnish the Tesla brand, bring down the stock price, and have a real impact on Musk’s pocketbook.\" Protesters believe that economic pressure will be the most effective way to challenge Musk’s influence.So far, neither Musk nor Tesla has responded to requests for comment about the protests.Social media and public backlashAnti-Tesla campaigns have also gained momentum on social media platforms like Instagram and X, using hashtags such as #TeslaTakedown and #Swasticars. The latter reference stems from a hand gesture Musk made, which some critics have likened to a Nazi salute. Musk has dismissed these accusations as unfounded political attacks.Some Tesla owners have also reported experiencing hostility due to their vehicles. Rainer Eckert, a Tesla driver in Washington state, said he has received repeated anonymous notes labeling his car a \"Nazi car.\" He recently put a sticker on his vehicle reading, \"Bought Before We All Knew He Was a Jerk,\" but it has not stopped the incidents.Broader anti-DOGE protestsThe Tesla-focused protests are part of a larger movement opposing federal job cuts. Thousands of people have demonstrated at national parks in response to the firing of over 1,000 National Park Service employees. Similarly, more than 1,000 people gathered at a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) building in Boulder, Colorado, to protest layoffs at the agency.Despite the growing dissent, some political figures are advising caution. Political strategist James Carville recently wrote in a New York Times column that Democrats should take a different approach, calling for \"the most daring political maneuver in the history of our party: roll over and play dead.\"Tesla’s financial performance and market reactionWhile it is difficult to measure the direct impact of these protests on Tesla’s sales, the company did experience a decline in annual vehicle sales for the first time last year. However, analysts attribute this primarily to increased competition in the electric vehicle (EV) market, particularly from Chinese automakers and legacy car manufacturers like General Motors.Tesla’s stock performance has also fluctuated. The company’s shares nearly doubled between late October and mid-December, coinciding with Trump’s re-election. However, since peaking on December 17, Tesla’s stock has dropped by more than 40%, though it remains valued at around $900 billion—far above any other automaker.Public opinion on Tesla has also shifted. A poll conducted after the November election for the advocacy group EV Politics Project found that 59% of voters who supported Kamala Harris held an unfavorable view of Tesla, compared to 36% of Trump voters. This suggests that Musk’s outspoken political stance is influencing consumer sentiment.","summary":"The 'Tesla Takedown' movement is gaining momentum as activists protest against Tesla and Elon Musk in response to federal job cuts linked to Musk's role in the Department of Government Efficiency.

This milestone was followed up by Trump’s announcement that there were only 8,326 migrant apprehensions at the border during his first full month in office, a figure dwarfed by the regular monthly averages seen during the previous administration.\n\nThe southern border is becoming so quiet that Tom Homan, who is leading the Trump administration’s deportation operation, says he doesn’t recall activity this calm in his entire career in federal immigration enforcement. The border czar first began working for the Border Patrol in 1984.\n\nControl of the southern border happened despite bipartisan border legislation introduced in early 2024 never becoming law. Then-President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris—who both claimed the bill was absolutely necessary in fixing the border crisis that began under their watch—repeatedly blamed Trump for its failure to pass Congress.\n\n“Why? A simple reason: Donald Trump. Because Donald Trump thinks it’s bad for him politically,” Biden said in February 2024 about the bill’s failure. “Therefore, he doesn’t—even though it would help the country, he’s not for it.”\n\n“He’d rather weaponize this issue than actually solve it,” the former president continued.\n\nThe bipartisan border deal—introduced by Oklahoma GOP Sen. James Lankford, Democrat Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, and former independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona—was a multi-billion dollar package that aimed to reduce border crossings by imposing stricter immigration and asylum laws. However, the bill also included provisions that ostensibly had nothing to do with the border crisis, such as aid to Ukraine, Taiwan, and Israel, and it quickly fell out of favor with many GOP lawmakers.\n\nBiden was far from the only Democrat to blame Trump and claim the legislation was paramount to fixing the border crisis. Harris, who replaced Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee following his disastrous debate performance, made it a top theme in her immigration platform.\n\n“But you know what happened to that bill?” Harris asked during her presidential debate with Trump in September. “Donald Trump got on the phone, called up some folks in Congress, and said, ‘Kill the bill.'”\n\n“And you know why? Because he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem,” Harris said.\n\nHowever, since reentering office, every metric appears to indicate that the Trump administration is fixing the immigration crisis. Not only have migrant encounters along the U.S-Mexico border fallen to historical lows, but popular migrant routes far south of Mexico have plummeted in activity—indicating that many would-be illegal migrants are simply not even bothering to enter the U.S. under the current administration.\n\nMore than half a million migrants crossed the Darien Gap, a vast jungle region between Panama and Colombia, at the height of the migrant crisis in 2023. Migrant crossings through the Darien dropped a staggering 94% in January compared to the same month last year, according to data released by Panama’s National Migration Service.\n\nAuthorities in Central America have since reported on a reverse migratory trend unfolding in the region, with many migrants now actually heading the opposite direction to reach destinations in South America—and even paying smugglers to help them.\n\n“Along the U.S.-Mexico frontier, Customs and Border Protection is currently reporting some of the lowest numbers of illegal alien encounters ever,” Matt O’Brien, investigation director for the Immigration Reform Law institute, said in a statement to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “This is proof-positive all that has ever been needed to secure America’s borders is a Trump-style commitment to actually using the enforcement authorities that have been in the Immigration and Nationality Act for decades.”\n\n“The Biden Administration claims that it couldn’t end illegal migration without passing an absurd new immigration bill were never anything but lies aimed at gaslighting the American public,” O’Brien said.\n\nOn his first day back in the Oval Office, Trump signed a flurry of executive orders aimed at controlling the southern border. His orders included a national emergency declaration allowing him to divert more military resources to the U.S.-Mexico border and resume wall construction, a designation of drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, a pause on refugee admissions and an end to birthright citizenship for individuals born on U.S. soil to illegal migrant parents.\n\nTrump successfully coerced both the Mexican and Canadian governments to do more to bolster border security, including a commitment of 10,000 national guard troops by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to help stop the flow of illegal immigration and illicit drugs.\n\nThe White House has also overseen a number of administrative changes, such as the cancellation of the CBP One app, the removal of “sensitive location” restrictions for deportation officers, and the marshaling of nearly every federal agency to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement in its arrest and deportation mission. The result has been the arrest of more than 20,000 illegal migrants in Trump’s first month in office, a rate far outpacing the Biden administration.\n\nThe actions are a far cry from Biden’s first month in office. The former president began by immediately attempting to order a moratorium on deportations for his first 100 days, and went on to issue a slate of executive orders that specifically unrolled the immigration enforcement apparatus built under Trump’s first term.\n\nBiden also immediately halted border wall construction, shuttered the “Remain in Mexico” program, ended Safe Third Country agreements with key Latin American nations, and undertook other actions that opened up the country to illegal immigration. Altogether, his administration made 296 executive actions on immigration issues in his first year in office.\n\nWhat followed after these executive orders was an unprecedented level of unlawful migration into the U.S. Fiscal year 2024 was the second worst year in history for illegal immigration, with nearly 3 million inadmissible encounters taking place, a number only surpassed by the record level experienced the previous year. An analysis by The New York Times found the level of net migration into the country under Biden was the largest in the country’s history.\n\nImmigration hawks argue that all it took was the enforcement of laws already on the books, not the passage of new laws, to get the southern border under control.\n\n“Instead of securing our borders, President Biden refused to enforce America’s immigration laws and instituted four years of open-borders policies,” Joey Chester, communications manager for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “The only reason he and others pushed for the Senate border bill last year is because it codified many of those open-borders policies into law and gave them a talking point to cover for years of reckless policies.”\n\n“The Trump administration has shown that the president has the authority to secure America’s borders, and illegal border crossings have plummeted as a result,” Chester said. “President Trump is doing this by enforcing our immigration laws, apprehending and detaining illegal aliens who cross the border, halting mass parole programs, ending asylum abuse, and shutting down the abuse of the CBP One app for illegal aliens to make appointments to enter the U.S.”\n\nOriginally published by the Daily Caller News Foundation","summary":"DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—President Donald Trump pushed border encounters to historical lows, and did so without signing into law a bipartisan border deal relentlessly lauded...

These influencers range from professionals fully engaged in politics to amateurs and their audiences of predominantly younger Australians. Their expanding audiences emphasize the increasing hybridity of Australia’s political and media systems and how influencers are shaping them. The 2024 U.S. presidential election showed the growing importance of social media influencers in electoral politics. Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris courted various online personalities. Trump appeared alongside Kick streamer Adin Ross and YouTuber Logan Paul while Democrat campaigners invited 200 influencers to the Democratic National Convention in August. These were obvious strategies given influencers are now a regular source of news for one in five Americans and more than a third of under 30s. Could influencers play a role in the Australian election? Australia’s political influencer landscape is less developed than the U.S., though influencers increasingly shape how people engage with politics. Research suggests that on Facebook only 14 percent of users get their news from influencers, while on YouTube this rises to 24 percent and is as high as 41 percent on TikTok. Meanwhile, 43 percent of YouTube users under 35 rely on influencers. These influencers broadly conform to three sometimes overlapping styles. The Professionals There are professional political influencers who engage full-time seriously and specifically with politics, primarily through podcasts and YouTube. Former Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson is a prominent example from the political right. Since creating a podcast and YouTube channel in 2018, he has integrated himself into an international coalition of conservative influencers. Anderson’s YouTube channel, which has more than 700,000 subscribers, features discussions with some of the most prominent conservative figures from the U.S., U.K., and Australia on topics relating to Western politics. Avi Yemini is another, working as the Australian correspondent for the far-right Canadian network Rebel News. Yemini has more than 900,000 subscribers and produces a blend of vlogs, often covering online drama, as well as field correspondence videos that might question pro-Palestine protesters in Melbourne or World Economic Forum attendees in Davos. Professional influencers from the political left include Labor-affiliated comedian Jordan Shanks-Markovina, aka Friendlyjordies, and the unaligned Konrad Benjamin, host of Punter’s Politics. With a combined 1.4 million YouTube subscribers, these influencers produce humorous vlogs and skits focusing on Australian politics that occasionally feature politicians. The Politically Affiliated The second category contains politically affiliated influencers, who are professionals with a broader field of interest, such as comedy, who also engage with politics. These figures often have larger audiences because of their broader appeal. Ozzy Man is one of Australia’s largest influencers, with 6 million subscribers on YouTube and 12 million followers on Facebook. He primarily produces humorous commentaries on viral videos but also frequently discusses politics, including supporting the Voice to Parliament in 2023. Opposition to the Voice to Parliament came from comedian Isaac Butterfield, who has more than 2 million YouTube subscribers and often comments on politics. The Amateurs Amateur influencers usually have smaller audiences. Despite often being well-versed in politics, these individuals primarily influence part-time or in informal settings. Generally, they lack access to professional broadcasting equipment and are increasingly embracing TikTok for the tools it offers amateur creators. Jordan van den Lamb, aka purplepingers, has developed an audience of more than 200,000 on TikTok, primarily through critiquing housing policy. It allowed him to launch a campaign for a Senate seat in 2025 as a candidate for the Victorian Socialists. Freya Leach leveraged her TikTok presence to run as a Liberal candidate in the 2023 NSW state election and has repeated that style in 2025 with viral videos. The Impact: The Hybrid Media System While amateur influencers continue to gain attention, many do so socially and for smaller audiences. Their impact is seen in the growing importance of influencer platforms as a whole, rather than in specific cases. However, professional and affiliated influencers have been matching the audiences of traditional news media on YouTube, the most popular platform for news in Australia. According to YouTube data, over the past year each video produced by these influencers (excluding Punter’s Politics) generally garnered more views than the averages of 7 News, 9 News, and ABC News combined. Still, the traditional outlets continue to generate more total views. Despite their growing audiences, it is unlikely that Australian political influencers will replace traditional media in online spaces. Instead, they are key aspects of what researchers call the “Hybrid Media System.” In this system, politics, old media and new media are increasingly interdependent, each informing how the others function. A recent TikTok from Peter Dutton featuring him reacting to remixed television coverage of Anthony Albanese is a good example. The Daily Mail reporting on a TikTok featuring Leach critiquing Albanese is another. Within this system influencers primarily play a mediating role, rarely creating political news but often interpreting and directing it. Their audiences trust both their ability to decide what is newsworthy – a practice known in both traditional and new media worlds as “newsgathering” – and to offer a reliable or at least entertaining interpretation of current events. New media has allowed these influencers to grow large audiences, though the successful migration of traditional media companies into the same spaces has been similarly crucial. What’s Likely This Time The importance of influencers in Australian electoral politics is overstated. The Gen Z party founded in 2023 to run influencer candidates has seemingly disbanded; Leach was unsuccessful in her 2023 campaign as it seems van den Lamb will be in 2025. Yet influencers have already been shaping politics in Australia. Researchers found that they played a role in defeating the Voice to Parliament and figures like Anderson are an already integrated aspect of the Coalition’s online presence. While it is unclear whether campaign billboards funded by Konrad Benjamin and his audience will sway voters, they might at least direct public debate.

Hank Johnson in the same video.

A Fox News Voter Analysis showed Trump's crossover appeal to Democratic constituencies was foundational to his success. He improved on his 2020 numbers among Hispanics (41%, +6 points), Black voters (15%, +7 points) and young voters (46%, +10 points). These rightward shifts were particularly notable among Hispanic men (+8 points), Black men (+12 points) and men under 30 (+14 points) from 2020. Trump's strength with Black voters was felt in Anson County, North Carolina, where the Republican candidate won there for the first time since the 1970s and only the second time in more than 100 years. Trump received 50.9% of the vote compared to 48.2% for then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Black residents make up 47% of the population in Anson County.
