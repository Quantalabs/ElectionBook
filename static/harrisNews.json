Never again,' he emphatically told MS Now, shutting down a potential run for Senate in the future. \n\nThe Democrats will put up Senator and former presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar, who Walz has endorsed. Minnesota's other Senate seat is also open and will be determined in the midterm elections.\n\nIt marks a stunning downfall for Walz, who had launched his quest for a third term just this past September. \n\nWalz was previously expected to run for a third consecutive term as Governor, despite his previous failed national campaign as Kamala Harris' vice-presidential running mate in the 2024 presidential election. \n\nYet, a growing number of elected officials inside Walz's party expressed concerns about the viability of him winning the gubernatorial election, according to the Minnesota Star Tribune reports ahead of his announcement.\n\nNearly a dozen Democrats who have spoken to the newspaper in recent weeks said they thought Walz should not seek re-election - with some even comparing his run for a third term to former President Joe Biden's doomed 2024 campaign.\n\nThe governor has been mired in a deepening scandal over scams involving state welfare, including payments to daycares and COVID-era loans. \n\nOver 90 people have been charged, with the majority of the defendants indicted so far coming from the Somali community. \n\nWalz, who was Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket in 2024, also noted that he 'came to the conclusion' he could not give his all to a political campaign after conversations with his family. \n\nWalz previously appeared to acknowledge some degree of fraud that existed in his state in a statement made last month.\n\n'This is on my watch. I am accountable for this. And more importantly, I am the one that will fix it,' Walz said at the time. \n\nIndependent journalist Nick Shirley conducted a series of visits to Minnesota daycares that serve the Somali community, attempting to interview the operators, and published his findings on X last month.\n\nShirley took a victory lap during Walz's presser, posting on X Monday that he 'ended Tim Walz.'\n\nShirley alleged that a Hennepin County daycare appeared closed when he visited, even though he claims it has received about $4 million in state childcare subsidies — a charge the center disputes and which has not been independently verified.\n\nThe shocking film sparked an immediate federal response including by FBI Director Kash Patel and Department of Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem who then announced investigations into the loans.\n\nProsecutors now say at least 57 people connected with the Feeding Our Future program billed the federal government $250 million, claiming to buy meals for children during the COVID pandemic.\n\nInstead, the defendants allegedly used the stolen money to buy Lamborghinis, Porsche SUVs, beachfront property in Kenya and private villas in the Maldives. The vast majority of those convicted in the case are Somali.\n\nInvestigators then found that around $9 billion in federal Medicaid funds supporting 14 Minnesota programs since 2018 may have been stolen, US Attorney Joe Thompson announced on December 18.\n\nEighty-two of the 92 defendants in the child nutrition, housing services and autism program scams are Somali, prosecutors say.\n\nIt was later revealed that Walz had connections with at least some of the refugees charged in the fraudulent scheme.\n\nWalz has also feuded with Trump until recently over ICE's presence in Minneapolis, including the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti.\n\nHowever, relations between the two have seemingly cooled this week, with a phone call leading to Border Czar Tom Homan's presence in the city over Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino.\n\nWalz praised protesters who had confronted members of ICE and Border Patrol in recent weeks during the interview.\n\n'They’re never going to run for office, and those grass-tops leaders brought this administration to their knees this week to do something about it. So there’s other ways to serve, and I’ll find them,' he said. \n\nKlobuchar's entry into the Minnesota gubernatorial race is formidable for both Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nNow in her fourth term as senator, Klobuchar won her last election in 2024 with over 56 percent of the vote despite President Donald Trump driving GOP turnout that year.\n\nShe also won her 2018 election with over 60 percent of the vote, and another statewide run in 2012 by over 65 percent.","summary":"The failed vice presidential nominee started 2026 trying to run for a third term as governor of the reliably Democrat-leaning state but said 'never again' to running for elected office.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15511167/Tim-Walz-political-career-over.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/29/23/105949617-0-image-m-13_1769728768152.jpg","video":"https://video.dailymail.com/video/mol/2025/12/29/3477422222171391650/1024x576_MP4_3477422222171391650.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-30 01:06:09","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

And experts in political science, African American studies and race reveal what they believe is behind the president’s “awkward” quip.\n\nTrump was speaking at a summit celebrating his administration’s launch of investment accounts for children called “Trump Accounts” when he announced that the “Super Freaky Girl” rapper was in attendance. He told the crowd that Minaj had pledged to invest “hundreds of thousands of dollars in Trump accounts” to support the future children of her fans.\n\nThe president then emphasized that Minaj — who has publicly aligned herself with the MAGA movement in recent months despite her past criticism of Trump — is a “big Trump supporter and Trump fan.” \n\nHe said that the rapper, who is Black, had taken “a little heat on occasion” from her “community,” before he appeared to reverse course. “She took a little heat on occasion. Her community isn’t necessaril— I tell ya, we did pretty damn well with your community, as we say,” he said, while speaking directly to Minaj before he invited her to the stage. \n\nTrump didn’t elaborate on Minaj’s “community,” but he has a history of boasting about his support from Black communities.\n\nDuring his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump suggested that the “Black population” embraced his mug shot more than any other community. Last year, he repeatedly claimed that he’d seen a “force of Black women” on TV in Chicago wearing red MAGA hats and cheering on his threats at the time to send federal troops to the Windy City. While speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania last month, Trump declared that “Black people love Trump.”\n\n“I got the biggest vote with Black people. They know a scam better than anybody. They know what it is to be scammed,” he said at the time. \n\nTrump made inroads with Black voters in 2024, but exit polls have shown that Black voters still overwhelmingly voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris. According to an NBC News exit poll, 86% of Black voters picked Harris, with the support of 77% of Black male voters and 92% of Black female voters. \n\nAlvin B. Tillery Jr., a professor of political science and African American studies at Northwestern University, said that when Trump refers to Minaj’s “community,” he’s “almost certainly signaling Blackness — both hers and, by extension, his supposed connection to Black voters.”\n\n“That move matters because it reveals how instrumental he views her presence,” he told HuffPost. “He’s not primarily engaging Minaj as an artist, a cultural critic or even an independent political actor; he’s treating her as a conduit to a racialized audience he knows he struggles to reach.”\n\nTrump’s ‘community’ quip was ‘transactional’ — and it says a lot about his views on whiteness, experts say.\n\nTillery believes Trump’s remarks about Minaj’s “community” were an example of “othering” — meaning the president views whiteness as universal.\n\n“By emphasizing her ‘community,’ Trump implicitly marks her as outside the default political mainstream — the community rather than our community,” he said. “It’s a familiar pattern in his rhetoric: Whiteness is unmarked and universal, while Blackness is highlighted, named and mobilized when useful.”\n\n“Minaj’s value, in this framing, is less about what she says and more about what she symbolizes — visibility, authenticity and cultural access to Black voters Trump knows he lacks organically,” he added. \n\nWhen Minaj took the stage at Wednesday’s summit, she proclaimed to be the president’s “No.1 fan.”\n\nKari J. Winter, a professor of American studies at the University at Buffalo whose expertise includes gender, feminism, race and class, called Trump’s remarks and the exchange between him and Minaj onstage “so cringe and shameless.” \n\n“The blatantly transactional nature of the staged exchange of hyperbolic praise between Trump and Minaj is so cringe and shameless as to defy description,” she said. “I would think that anyone watching it would be revolted.”\n\n“Trump revels in being around wealthy people, but he never forgets the color of their skin, as we can see in his awkward, non-sequitur comments about Minaj’s ‘community,’” she later continued. “He likes staging mutual-admiration moments with women and people of color to lightly veil his relentlessly misogynistic and racist policies and habits.”\n\nTrump ‘absolutely exaggerates’ his support from Black communities, Tillery says. \n\n“Trump absolutely exaggerates his support among Black voters. It’s true that he made some marginal gains — particularly among Black men — but those gains are routinely overstated to obscure a basic reality: An overwhelming majority of Black voters, men and women alike, supported Kamala Harris,” Tillery said. “That’s consistent with decades of voting behavior and with how Black voters have evaluated Trump’s record and rhetoric.”\n\nTillery said that the issue isn’t just that Trump often exaggerates the support he’s received from Black communities — it’s the performance behind it. \n\n“Trump often boasts about having Black supporters in ways that feel less like coalition-building and more like validation-seeking,” he said. “When he does this in front of Black audiences, it can come off as patronizing, even transactional: ‘Look, I’ve got some of you on my side.’”\n\n“That posture reinforces the sense that Black support is something to be displayed or counted, not meaningfully engaged. It’s politics as optics, not politics as representation,” he continued. \n\nShaun Harper, a professor of public policy, business and education at the University of Southern California, questioned why Trump didn’t explicitly say Black people instead of “community” in the first place. He noted that Minaj represents many things, i.e. she’s Black, a woman, a mother, a rapper and an immigrant. \n\nNonetheless, Harper said, Trump is “delusional” about the support he received from Black voters in 2024. \n\n“Trump remains delusional about how many Black people voted for him in the 2024 presidential election,” he said. “More than 83% of us voted for Kamala Harris. Those are the facts.”\n\nMAGA’s sudden enthusiasm for Minaj appears strategic, experts say. \n\nTrump and members of his administration have not missed the opportunity this week to flaunt Minaj’s enthusiastic support. \n\nOn Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shared a TikTok video on X, formerly Twitter, showing Minaj calling Trump her “favorite president” and “the best president of all time.” Trump then appears in the video calling Minaj “the queen of rap.” Katie Miller, the wife of White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, shared a video on X of her and the rapper taking part in a viral TikTok trend. Minaj is set to appear Tuesday on Miller’s podcast. \n\nMinaj has also been a topic on Fox News.\n\nDuring a segment on Fox News’ “Ingraham Angle” on Wednesday, host Laura Ingraham and Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) discussed Minaj and Trump’s appearance together earlier that day.\n\nIngraham noted that conservatives had previously complained about some of the lyrics in her songs, like the song “WAP” — except that’s not Minaj’s song. The 2020 hit song featuring Megan Thee Stallion was released by Cardi B.\n\nThe Fox News host went on to say that Minaj is “now bridging this gap from her world to Trump world.” \n\nWinter said that Ingraham’s on-air gaffe was quite “revealing.”\n\n“Ingraham’s confusion between Minaj, Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion might be intentional or accidental, but in either case it signals to her audience that she does not know or care who Minaj is or what her music is about,” she said. “Minaj is a stand-in for ‘Black female entertainer’ who is, in Ingraham’s rhetoric, obviously morally inferior to people like herself. ”\n\nWinter added that Ingraham gave Minaj a “patronizing shout-out” as a reward for her “obsequious praise of Trump.”\n\nHarper said that he respects Minaj’s choice to embrace Trump and that she doesn’t have to make the same political choices as he does. But he also questioned “how many MAGA Republicans will buy Minaj’s next album.” \n\n“How many of them can name three Nicki Minaj songs? They are profiting from using her as a mascot,” he said. “Perhaps she will somehow profit. But I comfortably predict that it won’t be through album sales, streaming numbers and concert tickets.” \n\nTillery believes that MAGA’s recent excitement over Minaj is all a part of a strategy. \n\n“The administration’s sudden enthusiasm for Minaj tells us a lot about its media strategy —and its anxieties,” he said. “Promoting her aggressively is a low-cost way to signal cultural relevance and racial outreach without changing policy positions that remain deeply unpopular with most Black voters.”\n\nAnd Ingraham’s “WAP” mix-up is further proof that the right’s enthusiasm isn’t about understanding hip-hop culture — “it’s about using it,” he said. \n\nTillery also pointed out that there’s irony in MAGA’s celebration of Minaj’s support.\n\n“Conservatives routinely rail against ‘Hollywood elites’ and celebrity political interventions — except when a celebrity can be framed as validating Trump,” he said. “At that point, the critique disappears.”\n\nTillery said that overall, the right’s excitement about Minaj is less about the rapper herself and more about what she represents: “A symbolic breach in the Democratic Party’s longstanding relationship with Black voters.”\n\n“The problem for Trump is that symbolism can’t substitute for substance — and Black voters, by and large, continue to vote as if they know the difference,” he said.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-nicki-minaj-community-experts_n_697b92efe4b09029f756ed25?origin=home-whats-happening-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/697b96a61b0000bdf76fe510.jpeg?cache=0lcrHNzzTT&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-30 00:59:14","author":"Kimberley Richards","authors":["Kimberley Richards"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.002},{"id":397530414,"title":"Why rising antisemitism pushes Josh Shapiro ‘to be more open about my faith’","text":"Voters don’t care about ideology, they care about deliverables, says Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. He calls himself the GSD governor – “Since this is the Christian Science Monitor, that’s ‘Get Stuff Done,’” he quips at an event hosted by the Monitor, as part of the Monitor Breakfast series.\n\nMr. Shapiro thinks the Democratic Party would benefit from following this approach. The governor, who was vetted as a possible running mate for Kamala Harris in 2024 and is seen now as a likely top contender for the Democratic nomination in 2028, has drawn attention recently with some criticism of the Biden administration, saying in a podcast this week that it failed to deliver “tangible things that people could see or feel.”\n\nBut Mr. Shapiro’s sharpest critiques are aimed at President Donald Trump, who the governor says is making America less safe – placing American citizens at risk through immigration enforcement operations that have turned violent, and damaging perceptions of America abroad.\n\n“I am concerned that some foreign countries will boycott the World Cup,” Mr. Shapiro says, addressing a question regarding travelers’ worries about their safety inside the United States. Philadelphia is scheduled to host six World Cup matches this summer.\n\nOn immigration, Mr. Shapiro, like other Democratic officials, is unequivocal: The federal deportation campaign directed by Mr. Trump is violating the constitutional rights of Americans. The governor says his state is taking steps to prepare “should this come to our door.”\n\nThose plans involve law enforcement, Mr. Shapiro says, though he declines to share specifics. In Minneapolis, the number of federal immigration agents and officers deployed there vastly outnumbers local officers.\n\nHe believes the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti last weekend in Minneapolis warrants a state investigation. And based on publicly available evidence, Mr. Shapiro – who was attorney general of Pennsylvania before he was governor – sees a strong case against the federal officers who fired the shots.\n\nFor now, he’s focused on his own reelection and helping his party in November’s midterms, which he says will be a referendum on the Trump administration. “I don’t think we should be thinking about anything other than curtailing the chaos, the cruelty, and the corruption of this administration,” he says. “The best way for voters to do that is by showing up in record numbers in these midterms.”\n\nThat includes being vigilant about election integrity. A portrait of William Penn, the founder of the Pennsylvania colony, hangs above his desk, Mr. Shapiro notes, emphasizing the commonwealth’s role in establishing the American rights to free elections and freedom of expression and religion. He anticipates a possible showdown with Mr. Trump over those values.\n\nThis past fall, the Trump administration requested access to Pennsylvania’s voter rolls – including voters’ personal information. Mr. Shapiro refused. Pennsylvania, along with five other states, is now being sued by the Justice Department. “I do not trust this administration to use [voter rolls] for anything other than nefarious purposes,” he says.\n\nIn a telltale sign of an expected presidential campaign, Mr. Shapiro has penned a memoir. In his book, “Where We Keep the Light,” which was released this week, he writes at length about his faith. An observant Jew who keeps kosher, he is candid about the risks to his family in a time of surging antisemitism. Last April, on the first night of Passover, a man set fire to the governor’s residence while Mr. Shapiro, his wife, and their children were asleep inside.\n\nIt isn’t just politicians who are being targeted. In the wake of the 2018 attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and the Oct. 7, 2023, attack against Israel, the governor has had people tell him of their fear to live openly as Jews.\n\n“I’ve felt a responsibility to be more open about my faith,” Mr. Shapiro says. “I have this responsibility now to offer comfort to others.”\n\nThe governor also says it is critical to emphasize religious pluralism. The dining room in the governor’s mansion, which was destroyed in the attack last year, has been emblematic of his approach. It has been decorated with Christmas trees, hosted an Iftar dinner, and been the setting for his son’s bar mitzvah.\n\nMr. Shapiro wishes people Merry Christmas or Happy Hanukkah, depending on their faith, something he says demonstrates respect for others. “When I see a federal government taking their religion, or any religion, and trying to impose that on others, as a person of faith … that violates everything I believe in,” he says.\n\n“People of different faiths or different religions have strengthened my faith because we found that shared humanity,” the governor says. “That, in many ways, is the American way.”","summary":"Pennsylvania Gov.

When backed into a corner, economically or militarily, they immediately start to engage in one behavior, which is commonly described as their \"...mouths writing checks their butts can't cash.\" This is something with which Iran's brutal theocracy has a lot of experience. \n\nIn the latest episode of Mullahs Running Off at the Mouth, Iran has threatened the United States with attacks on our bases and aircraft carriers in the region, should the Trump administration decide to start solving problems with a suitable application of high explosives.\n\nIran threatened Thursday to instantly strike U.S. bases and aircraft carriers in response to any attack, after President Donald Trump warned time was running out for Tehran and the EU blacklisted its Revolutionary Guards as a terror group.As Brussels and Washington dialled up their own rhetoric and Iran issued stark threats, UN chief Antonio Guterres called for nuclear negotiations to \"avoid a crisis that could have devastating consequences in the region\".\n\nDevastating consequences for the mullahs, of course. Devastating consequences for those barbarians are perfectly appropriate. They've earned it.\n\nAn Iranian military spokesman warned Tehran's response to any U.S. action would not be limited -- as it was in June last year when American planes and missiles briefly joined Israel's short air war against Iran -- but would be a decisive response \"delivered instantly\".Brigadier General Mohammad Akraminia told state television U..S. aircraft carriers have \"serious vulnerabilities\" and that numerous American bases in the Gulf region are \"within the range of our medium-range missiles\".\n\nThe primary vulnerability our aircraft carrier task groups have where Iran is concerned is the danger of our Navy officers and men falling overboard while seized in laughing fits.\n\nRead More: Trump's Armada Advances: Iran Now on Notice for Nuclear Deal\n\nNow, there are actions Iran could take. They still have Hezbollah, Hamas, and other proxy groups. They could launch attacks against our troops and bases in the region. They could launch some of their missiles, which have a success rate only a notch or two above Kamala Harris's presidential campaigns. And we should not take that possibility lightly; I'd be gobsmackingly surprised if our troops and installations anywhere in that area aren't standing at high alert right now.\n\nBut then, our people in that part of the world should be on high alert pretty much all the time. My time in that part of the world was pretty brief and, for the most part, pretty safe, as these things go, but we were all pretty alert anyway. It's just that kind of place. But our aircraft carriers? Seriously? These are the best-guarded ships in the world, and yes, that's because in any conflict, they are going to be the ones everyone wants to send to the bottom. But the Iranians just don't have this capability. The primary threat the mullahs pose now is climate change caused by their endless emissions of superheated gas. \n\nMeanwhile, on the streets, the regular Iranian folks are expressing some doubt that this will end in anything other than a bitter, bloody struggle.\n\nIn Tehran on Thursday, citizens expressed grim resignation.\"I think the war is inevitable and a change must happen. It can be for worse, or better. I am not sure,\" said a 29-year-old waitress, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\"I am not in favour of war. I just want something to happen that would result in something better.\"Another 29-year-old woman, an unemployed resident of an upscale neighbourhood in northern Tehran, told AFP: \"I believe that life has highs and lows and we are now at the lowest point.\"Neither the economic situation, nor our livelihood is good. It is the lowest for me.\"\n\nIt is these people who are the victims here. They are the ones who have suffered the longest and the most under the rule of these theocratic savages. They are the ones who have lost the most and will lose the most. But they are also among the best reasons the United States and the nations of Europe have for finally ending the mullahs' rule, and if that means the permanent revocation of their birth certificates and changing their pronouns to \"was\" and \"were,\" then so be it.

They just care about getting an office. This is a different human being. [Trump] is a different president. This is a different kind of leader. This is a businessman and an authentic human being.

For nonsurgical procedures, the five most common were botulism toxin (Botox), hyaluronic acid (filler), hair removal, skin tightening, and chemical peels.\n\nFor women, the top three were liposuction, eyelid surgery, and breast augmentation. For men, it’s eyelid surgery, gynecomastia, and scar revision.\n\nAnd two age groups — the Baby Boomers and Generation X — are responsible for a whopping 75% of all procedures. So, if you’re a Gen-Xer like me, take a bow, because our generation was responsible for:\n\n48% of all tummy tucks51% of all buttock lifts43% of all breast implant removals57% of all neuromodulator injections50% of all hyaluronic acid fillers\n\n(Who says we’re slackers?! If anything, we’re overachieving!)\n\nAs for the other generations:\n\n50% of all facial procedures were Baby Boomers35% of breast augmentations were Millennials41% of buttock augmentations (with fat grafting) were Millennials37% of rhinoplasties were Gen Z25% of cheek implants were Gen Z\n\nOf course, a lot depends on how we define cosmetic, age-defying “alterations.” Amidst our quest for Ponce de Leon’s Fountain of Youth, Pew Research reported:\n\nOf the four things we asked about, coloring hair to cover grays is the most common step Americans have taken to look younger than they are (27% say they’ve done this). About one-in-five (21%) say they have taken antiaging supplements.Far smaller shares say they have gotten nonsurgical cosmetic treatments (5%) or cosmetic plastic surgery (3%).In total, 40% of U.S. adults say they have done at least one of these to look younger than they are.Some people who haven’t done these things say they would at least consider doing them. Taken together:56% have taken or would consider taking antiaging supplements.52% have colored or would consider coloring their hair to cover grays.23% have gotten or would consider getting nonsurgical cosmetic treatments.18% have gotten or would consider getting cosmetic plastic surgery.\n\nThere’s also a gender divide:\n\nFor example, 45% of women say they have colored their hair to cover grays and 28% say they have taken antiaging supplements. Among men, 8% and 13% have done these things, respectively. \n\nApropos of the times, there’s now a political angle to plastic surgery:\n\nUSA Today: Mar-a-Lago face’? I’d Prefer to Make Aging Normal AgainThe Week: Mar-a-Lago Face: Has MAGA Plastic Surgery Trend Peaked?The Guardian: Plastic Surgeons Wrestle With Requests for ‘Mar-a-Lago Face’: ‘You’re Going to Look Like Maleficent’New York Times: From Kardashian Injectable Lips to Mar-a-Lago FaceAxios: D.C.

And when Nancy Pelosi was at her height of power (and tearing up speeches on national television), reporters dutifully avoided all mentions of her, ahem, age-defying appearance. (Sen. Lindsey Graham actually apologized for joking about it.)\n\nBesides, isn’t it sexist to knock a woman for her physical appearance? \n\nThe so-called “Mar-a-Lago face” is almost exclusively a female phenomenon and is mostly used by the left to mock, insult, and belittle conservative women.\n\nThe Daily Beast has literally published hundreds upon hundreds of articles referring to Homeland Security Director Kristi Noem as “ICE Barbie” — and the silence of all the morally upstanding feminists has been deafening.\n\nIf the high heel shoe was on the other foot, the Democrats and their allies in the mainstream media would be howling with rage if conservatives had derided liberal women as Barbies, mocked their appearances, or insinuated that their body parts were full of Confederate money.\n\nBut the truth is, most of the top Democratic women are far less attractive than the top Republican women.\n\nOn the GOP side, we have Karoline Leavitt, Melania Trump, Pam Bondi, Kristi Noem, Lauren Boebert, Megyn Kelly, Nancy Mace, Anna Paulina Luna, Tulsi Gabbard, Kelly Loeffler, Alina Habba, Erika Kirk, Laurel Lee — and that’s just the tip of the iceberg. (With an honorable mention to Sydney Sweeney.) No shortage of beauties!\n\nAs Wayne and Garth might’ve said, we’ve become the party of Babe-raham Lincoln:\n\nAnd then, on the Democratic side, there’s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and, uh… yup, that’s about it. (Unless Kamala Harris, Rosa DeLauro, Jill Biden, or Jasmine Crockett is your cup of tea.) \n\nWell, there’s also Rachel Levine and Sarah McBride, but I’d still give the edge to the GOP.\n\nBottom line? \n\nIf you work in a visual medium, then your appearance matters. It’s part of your overall brand, and I can’t fault someone for trying to maximize their career — even if it includes plastic surgery.\n\n(Furthermore, I’m not gonna say a peep about women who’ve had breast augmentations after battling cancer and having a mastectomy. That’s a different category altogether.)\n\nAnd honestly, some people look significantly better after a pull here or a tuck there. Plastic surgery is popular because… it often works.\n\nBut there’s still something sad and pathetic about it, isn’t there?\n\nTo me, obvious, over-the-top plastic surgery screams “insecure.” I could be wrong, but I don’t think it’s happy, confident people who are spending tens of thousands to revamp their faces.\n\nInstead, it’s people haunted by fears, trauma, and self-doubt.\n\nAnd everything else being equal, I’d rather vote for a happy, confident candidate than one who’s riddled with insecurities.\n\nWouldn’t you?","url":"https://pjmedia.com/scott-pinsker/2026/01/29/would-you-have-plastic-surgery-to-look-younger-n4948907","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/213/50b69dae-49f7-44d9-a251-4942a42ce04d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 22:12:15","author":"Scott Pinsker","authors":["Scott Pinsker"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.071},{"id":397495760,"title":"The only federal regulator that oversees prediction markets says it will ease up on Kalshi and Polymarket","text":"The chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Thursday said the agency will rescind its warnings to prediction-market operators — and threatened to fight with state regulators that are trying to stop them.Michael Selig said the commission would yank a 2025 memo issued by three senior CFTC staffers advising prediction markets to have back-up plans if courts scuttled their sports contracts.The memo&comma; he said&comma; \"contributed to uncertainty in our markets.\"He also said he was scrapping a previous rulemaking effort that would have limited prediction markets and is starting over — a process that could take years.\"For too long&comma; the CFTC&apos;s existing framework has proven difficult to apply and has failed our market participants&comma;\" he said Thursday&comma; in his first public remarks since taking the reins at the key federal finance regulator. \"That is something I intend to fix by establishing clear standards for event contracts that provide certainty to market participants.\"\"Event contracts\" is a term to describe the instruments that people trade on prediction markets.He also hinted that the CFTC could intervene in lawsuits where Kalshi and other prediction markets&comma; like the one operated by Crypto.com&comma; are fighting with state regulators.

Is It Real or Just a Grift?","text":"Retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman has thrown his rather large and oleaginous hat into the ring for Florida's 2026 election fill the remainder of Marco Rubio's term. Under Florida law, the death or resignation of a senator or member of the House triggers a special election. When Marco Rubio, who won his 2022 race by 16 points, resigned last January to become President Trump's Secretary of State, National Security Adviser, administrator of the US Agency for International Development, the Archivist of National Archives and Records Administration, and is rumored to be the future governor of Greenland and president of Cuba and Venezuela, Governor Ron DeSantis appointed Florida's attorney general, Ashley Moody, to hold the position until the special election in Novermber.\n\n Vindman announced his entry with a video spot called \"Patriot.\"\n\nWOLF BLITZER:Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vinman, a National Security Council official who testified against the president during the impeachment hearings, has been fired. Jim, the president has been fuming about Vinman, apparently, ever since he testified.VINDMAN: The last time you saw me was here swearing an oath to tell the truth about a president who broke his See, my family came to America as refugees to escape tyranny. And I sure as hell was not going to bow down to some wannabe tyrant. This president unleashed a reign of terror and retribution not just against me and my family, but against all of us. Today, our country is in chaos. Thug militias attacking citizens. Tariffs pushing prices sky-high. Healthcare premiums through the roof. And Florida homeowners are being absolutely screwed because Ashley Moody caved to the big insurance companies.They put Moody in the Senate to be a yes vote for Trump and the billionaires. She's not Florida Senator, she's theirs. I'm Alex Vindman and I'm running to be your voice in the Senate.I served 21 years in the army, was wounded in Iraq. I served presidents of both parties and I've seen corruption in Washington up close. Over a million dollars in Moody's corporate stock was traded last year while she had access to insider information only Congress gets, that should be outlawed. They gutted disaster assistance for people trying to rebuild their lives, but she's okay with $40 billion bailouts for Argentina. Where's the bailout for Florida's families? I stepped up when my country needed a soldier. I stood up when someone had to say no one is above the law. I'm asking you, stand with me now to put a check on Donald Trump and the corrupt politicians who think your tax dollars are their personal piggy bank. The billionaires and the special interests will throw everything they've got to try to stop us. But in infantry, we didn't back down from a fight. In a democracy, you decide who's going to stand for you, the patriot or the politician.Join us.\n\nAs you recall, Vindman is the central figure in Trump's first impeachment, where he used his access to a classified readout of a call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to start the impeachment process.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nI can't find out when Vindman decided to decamp from the Washington suburbs to Florida, but it seems to have happened sometime in 2025. This interview on the Miami CBS affiliate, from May 2025, is the first hint that Vindman may be running for office on the Carpetbagging Democrat ticket.\n\nVindman's unique selling proposition is that he is honest, or at least as honest as anyone who breaks their oath of office, misuses classified information, and attempts to participate in a soft coup on a sitting president. And that he's against the Notorious Tyrant Trump. Again, Trump carried the state by ten points and beat Kamala Harris by 13.\n\nThe Democrat field has four definite candidates and eight others have filed paperwork opening the way for a run. In fairness, the Democrat nomination is probably Vindman's to lose because of the flaccidity of the field. In fact, Vindman oozes that Beto O'Rourke ambiance of a loser and a poseur who can't win but who can convince Democrat donors that he, through his love for doughnuts, can turn Florida blue. On the first day of Vindman's campaign, he raised $1.7 million from \" 36,000 contributions total — with 99 percent of online donations totaling $100 or less.\" I wouldn't count on that volume of donations continuing; see Panic Hits Democrats As Trump Goes After Their Money and Infrastructure – RedState.\n\nSo why does this rotund oxygen thief suddenly show an interest in running for office in some place where winning isn't likely?\n\nI think the reason is much more self-interested and has less to do with standing up to \"tyranny\" than with saving Vindman's rather ample behind from the consequences of his illegal acts in 2020.\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, President Trump made it known that he intended to bring to justice those people involved in what appears to be a massive electoral fraud campaign that put the obviously demented Joe Biden in the White House. Since then we've seen the illegally appointed \"special counsel,\" Jack Smith grilled in public and private over his \"Arctic Frost\" investigation that encompassed President Trujmp and other prominent elected GOP officials (Brandon Gill Trounces Jack Smith and Leaves Him in the Dust During Epic Grilling – RedState); some 315,000 seemingly illegal ballots have been revealed to have been processed in Fulton County, Georgia ('We Don't Dispute' It: Georgia 315k Vote Bombshell Blows a Big Hole in 2020's 'Most Secure Election' Lie – RedState) which has led to an federal search warrant and an FBI raid on that county's voting office; see FBI Raids Fulton County Election Hub Days After Trump Vows Prosecutions for 2020 Election - Here We Go – RedState.\n\nVindman is up to his unibrow in the Deep State effort to prevent Trump from being reelected in 2020. If that isn't known now, it will be known before President Trump leaves office in 2029. By running for office, Vindman can claim that any investigation is just Trump being vindictive; note his \"retribution...against me and my family\" comment in his ad? Even though his campaign is going nowhere, it will still raise money, both legit contributions on the theory that this will force the GOP to spend money in what should be a practically uncontested race, and from ActBlue smurfing of funds. Vindman can divert campaign funds to his legal defense on the theory that these charges wouldn't have been brought but for his running for office, and he can use his candidacy to fund a legal defense fund.\n\nThe two takeaways from this are that Vindman has a √-1 chance of winning, and he knows it. I'm not an expert on Florida politics, but Ron DeSantis isn't going to put an insurance industry shill in the Senate. As no hurricanes hit Florida this year, I suspect his claim about \"disaster assistance\" is likewise phony. The campaign is a grift designed to muddy the waters around any prosecution related to President Trump's first impeachment and to fund his legal defense. We have to turn out to vote, but he really isn't in this to win. The other bit of good news is that if there is evidence he was involved in what looks like an internal coup attempt against President Trump by the intelligence community, he's going to need every dime of whatever legal defense money he raises.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy AMELIA WYNNE, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:19:43 GMT, 29 January 2026 |Updated:20:49 GMT, 29 January 2026 \n\nThere have been plenty of bombshell revelations in former Coronation Star Helen Flanagan's brand new autobiography.\nThe Rosie Webster actress, 35, opened up about her ex Scott Sinclair, growing up in the world of soaps and the tough times she's had with her mental health over the years.\nAnd among the revelations she has shared details of her various feuds with people she's met along her career.\nIn one passage from the book she describes an unnamed 'mean girl' on the set of Corrie and claimed that TV presenter Yvette Fielding 'detested' her.\nHelen described the period in time when she returned to Corrie in 2017 after a break and claimed that the atmosphere on set had 'changed' and that unkind cliques had begun to form.\nShe writes in Head & Heart: Break-ups, Breakdowns and Being Rosie: 'There were cliques amongst the cast which seemed a bit exclusionary, and I was made to feel particularly uncomfortable by another actress who could be quite sarcastic and cold with me.\n\nThere have been plenty of bombshell revelations in former Coronation Star Helen Flanagan's brand new autobiography\n\nAnd among the revelations she has shared details of her various feuds with people she's met along her career (seen as Rosie in 2018)\n'Maybe her nose was out of joint because my return had attracted a fair bit of press attention – not something I could have helped – but I do think she had a false impression of me.\n'I'd end up sitting on my own a lot of the time in the canteen feeling quite left out. It was like a real-life Mean Girls when I think about it now. I can get on with everyone, but this actress just wasn't very nice to me.'\nShe also described working with Yvette on Celebrity Super-Spa in 2013, claiming she 'absolutely detested' her and 'made no secret of it'.\nHelen even claimed that Yvette called her 'evil' at one point.\nIn the book she also shed light on her feud with her former Corrie co-star and on-screen boyfriend Ryan Thomas.\nShe detailed how she clashed with the star, who played Jason Grimshaw.\nSpeaking about their spat, she revealed her frustrations stemmed from many sources, including the fact that Ryan was 'grumpy' and 'never knew his lines'. \nThe Celebrity Big Brother star played Jason on the soap from 2000 up till 2016 and despite their romance on-screen they clashed away - although Helen conceded that as time has gone on they have formed a friendship. \nIn the autobiography, she penned: 'Me and Ryan Thomas, weren't on the best of terms in real life either – we used to clash something chronic, mainly because he would be dead grumpy in the mornings and never used to know his lines!...\n\nJoin the debate\nWhat's YOUR take on Helen's past feuds?Comment now\n\nIn one passage from the book she describes an unnamed 'mean girl' on the set of Corrie and claimed that TV presenter Yvette Fielding 'detested' her\n\nShe also described working with Yvette (seen) on Celebrity Super-Spa in 2013, claiming she 'absolutely detested' her and 'made no secret of it'\n\nIn the book she also shed light on her feud with her former Corrie co-star and on-screen boyfriend Ryan Thomas (seen on the show together in 2010) \nIn the quotes seen by The Sun, she continued: 'Over the years since, however, we've moved in similar circles and become quite good friends and I've got a lot of time for Ryan and his brothers, Adam and Scott. They're good lads.' \nElsewhere in the book, she revealed that she and her on-screen sister Brooke Vincent dated the same Man City player - before her doomed relationship with Scott Sinclair.\n\n Helen Flanagan steps out in quirky pink jacket after taking a swipe at her footballer ex-fiancé Scott Sinclair \nBefore meeting her now footballer ex Scott, Helen had a brief romance with Man City star Reece Wabara while shortly after they fizzled out Brooke went on to date him.\nShe went on to say he was 'gorgeous' but that thinks quickly fizzled out before claiming he was 'a ladies' man anyway.'\nHelen went on to be in a relationship with Scott. They have three children Matilda, 10, Delilah, seven, and Charlie, four. But they split in 2022 after 13 years together.\nEarlier this week sources claimed that Scott had decided Helen had to move out of the £1.5M six-bedroom home they previously shared after communication between them 'completely broken down'.\nAnd last week, Helen begged followers to stop sending her messages about Scott following their feud taking a dramatic turn.\nTaking to her Instagram Stories, she shared a video insisting she 'didn't care' about her former fiancé and wanted fans to stop contacting her about him.\nThe star said: 'I've been getting messages as well, quite a lot of DMs about the whereabouts of the father of my kids'.\n'Please, I really don't care. No one needs to DM me and tell me his personal business. I'm spared of that now'.\nThe house, which is in Scott's name, was put on the market last year, and it's now thought that he believes Helen needs to move into a smaller property as he wants to stop paying the maintenance.\nA source added that communication between the exes has 'completely broken down,' and they now only speak through Helen's parents.\nThey told The Sun: 'But Helen doesn't want to move and is digging her heels in. She loves the place, the kids are settled at the local school and her mum and dad live around the corner.\n'Scott wants to buy Helen a four-bedroom home. He's even offered to put it in her name but wants to stop the maintenance payments.'\nScott had previously put the house up for sale for £1.5million last May, but reduced the house £1.195million four weeks later. In September it was reduced to £995,000.\nAnother source has claimed that Scott is yet to find Helen an alternative home, saying: 'Scott wants to sell to take the money out, but he hasn't found Helen or the kids a new place. \n'He's not being reasonable. He and Helen are not on the same page.'\n\nElsewhere in the book, she revealed that she and her on-screen sister Brooke Vincent dated the same Man City player - before her doomed relationship with Scott Sinclair\nThe Daily Mail contacted representatives for Helen Flanagan and Scott Sinclair for comment at the time.\nLast month, Helen launched a furious attack on her ex-partner Scott after he failed to attend their son's school nativity.\nThe soap star split from the Bristol Rovers footballer in 2022 following 13 years together.\nHelen publicly criticised Scott after he shared posts from Abu Dhabi, where he spent the weekend attending the Grand Prix.\nRe-sharing his Instagram post, Helen raged: 'You really are a piece of s***. How dare you not turn up to Charlie's nativity.'\nHelen FlanaganCoronationRyan Thomas\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHelen Flanagan reveals even more of her past feuds including with one 'mean girl' Corrie co-star and a TV legend who she claims 'despised her'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 34\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Schulz was outraged that after the shooting, top Trump administration officials rushed to disparage Pretti as a “domestic terrorist.”\n\nSchulz, who gave Trump a softball interview weeks before the 2024 election, continued, “It’s like they didn’t even have a moment where they’re like, ‘Hey, we’re reviewing the footage, we’re reviewing the footage. We’re gonna try to see what’s really happening.’”\n\n“All of them, Trump and all the cronies, put out collective statements that immediately blamed an American citizen that was exercising his First and Second Amendment rights,” Schulz said. \n\nSchulz and his panel of co-hosts ranted against Trump, 79, for more than six minutes. \n\n“If you seen with your own eyes, you know exactly what happened,” Schulz continued. “And there’s something disgusting that’s happening, not just in Minneapolis, I’m sure it’s happening in other parts of the United States. Every time something horrific happens, they keep going, ‘but look at the pedophiles we got. Look at the murderers we got. Look at all the violent criminals we got.”\n\nSchulz added, “I looked at the numbers. It’s five percent of the people they deported are violent criminals.”\n\nFlagrant co-host Akaash Singh then chimed in, “There’s probably more pedophiles in the Oval Office.”\n\nSchulz agreed, breaking with the administration on yet another issue—the still-not-released Epstein files. \n\n“If you bring up another f---ing pedophile about deporting and you’re not releasing the Epstein list, just shut the f--k up, all of you,” Schulz said. “Yes, I don’t want to hear anything else about, ‘Oh, we’ve got to deport the pedophiles.’ They’re right here. They’re right here. There’s a list of them, and you’re not exposing it.”\n\nSchulz, a Manhattan native, interviewed Trump in October 2024 and said he went on to vote for him the following month. His rationale for voting for Trump was that Democrats were “not cool” and his vote was based on “who gets the most p---y.”\n\nThe comedian, who has since apologized for the remark, acknowledged that critiques of him giving Trump a platform are fair, though he claims he also tried to interview Trump’s Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris. \n\nHe first broke with the Trump administration on the Flagrant podcast back in July 2025.\n\nAt that time, Schulz insisted that he voted for “none” of the Trump administration’s actions. “He’s doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for. I want him to stop the wars—he’s funding them. I want him to shrink spending, reduce the budget—he’s increasing it,“ Schulz said. \n\nIt appears the podcaster has since continued his 180 on Trump and MAGA politics, especially on the issue of ICE running lawlessly through American cities. He brought the topic up on last week’s Flagrant episode as well.","summary":"Getty ImagesThe popular podcast bro who voted for President Donald Trump believes the president’s immigration crackdown has reached a “breaking point.”\n\nAndrew Schulz, 42, said the 37-year-old Veterans Affairs nurse Alex Pretti was “murdered in cold blood” by Border Patrol agents on his podcast Flagrant on Wednesday.

According to multiple reports, the newsroom could see over 100 employees laid off, and the company as a whole may cut as many as 300 staffers.\n\nWith the looming layoffs spooking the newsroom, especially among reporters working at the desks that are likely to be impacted the most, journalists at the paper began tweeting under the hashtag #SaveThePost in an effort to grab the attention of the Amazon founder who purchased the outlet more than a decade ago.\n\nAmid the social media campaign targeting Bezos and his socialite wife Lauren Sanchez, dozens of the Post’s foreign correspondents sent a “collective plea” letter to the billionaire begging him to reverse course. “We urge you to consider how the proposed layoffs will certainly lead us first to irrelevance and later extinction — not the shared success that remains attainable,” the staff wrote.\n\nIn their letter to Bezos on Thursday, the White House team – which is not expected to be affected by the cuts – spotlighted the collaboration they have had with the sections that could see brutal layoffs.\n\n“Given the uncertainty facing the Post, we wanted to tell you directly how the White House team relies on other desks and explain how our colleagues’ work helps lift up our own,” the DC reporters wrote.\n\n“We are clear eyed about the financial challenges facing the paper. When we accepted our assignments to cover the White House last year, we took the job with a goal to win back former subscribers and draw in new readers,” the letter continued. “A diversified Washington Post helps us do it.”\n\nIn an internal Slack chat that was viewed by CNN, White House bureau chief Matt Viser wrote: “If the plan, to the extent there is one, is to reorient around politics we wanted to emphasize how much we rely on collaboration with foreign, sports, local — the entire paper, really. And if other sections are diminished, we all are.”\n\nThe reporters at the paper are notably circumventing Lewis, the Post’s embattled publisher and CEO, and appealing to Bezos directly at this point.\n\nThis is all happening after the Washington Post has suffered through years of declining revenues, which was exacerbated after Bezos decided to block the editorial board’s endorsement of Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and push the publication’s opinion section into a conservative-leaning direction. \n\nThose moves by the Blue Origin founder were seen as an attempt to curry favor with Donald Trump amid the president’s return to the White House, leading to the cancellations of hundreds of thousands of paid subscriptions. \n\nAdditionally, with Bezos seeming indifferent to the newsroom’s concerns – he snubbed an invitation to speak with the staff when he was in town for Trump’s inauguration – the Post has witnessed an exodus of editorial talent in the past year.\n\nAll the while, as the recent Bezos-led changes and turmoil have cost the paper, Lewis is aiming to try to push the Post into profitability this year by taking a lean approach and cutting more and more costs.\n\nThis has prompted former and current Post journalists to wonder if the paper “is slashing its way to irrelevance” amid an “existential meltdown,” with staffers completely losing faith in both Bezos and Lewis.\n\n“There’s now a strong sense that neither Jeff Bezos nor Will Lewis are serious, good-faith stewards of The Washington Post,” one veteran correspondent told CNN, adding that the pair “drove us into a ditch with their decisions, particularly the reinvention of the Opinion section, costing us hundreds of thousands of subscribers.”\n\nAnother former desk told New York magazine that “when people were deciding which subscriptions they could live without, the Post was an easy cut.” On top of that, according to the source, Bezos “made it a lot easier with his decisions” and now the paper’s “left with something that's basically on life support” because of the lack of vision.","summary":"‘Given the uncertainty facing the Post, we wanted to tell you directly how the White House team relies on other desks and explain how our colleagues’ work helps lift up our own,’ the letter read.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/washington-post-jeff-bezos-layoffs-b2910466.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/27/16/jeffbezonwp.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 20:41:03","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.021},{"id":397490344,"title":"Tim Walz says he’s done with politics: ‘I will never run for office again’","text":"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz says his time as a political candidate is over. \"I will never run for an elected office again. Never again,\" Walz, the Democratic Party's 2024 vice presidential nominee, said in an interview with MS NOW. Facing stinging criticism from President Donald Trump, other Republicans, and even some Democrats over a massive fraud scandal rocking Minnesota, Walz earlier this month announced that he was dropping his 2026 bid for an unprecedented third term as governor of the blue-leaning state. But at the time, he didn't rule out any future runs for elected office. Since Walz's announcement, the state has become the epicenter in the heated battle over Trump's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration, following the fatal shootings by federal agents of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis who were protesting deportation operations. FRAUD FALLOUT FORCES WALZ TO ABANDON GUBERNATORIAL RE-ELECTION BID Pointing to the protests against the actions by federal agents, Walz said there are \"heroes on the streets that we don’t know their names.\" \"They’re never going to run for office, and those grass-tops leaders brought this administration to their knees this week to do something about it. So there’s other ways to serve, and I’ll find them,\" the governor added. Walz launched his re-election bid in September but in December started facing a barrage of incoming political fire from Trump and Republicans, and some Democrats, over the large-scale theft, under his watch as governor, in a state that has long prided itself on good governance. More than 90 people — most from Minnesota's large Somali community — have been charged since 2022. KLOBUCHAR LAUNCHES BID FOR MINNESOTA GOVERNOR IN BID TO SUCCEED WALZ How much money has been stolen through alleged money laundering operations involving fraudulent meal and housing programs, daycare centers and Medicaid services is still being tabulated. But the U.S. attorney in Minnesota said the scope of the fraud could exceed $1 billion and rise to as high as $9 billion. Federal prosecutors said some of the dozens that have already pleaded guilty in the case used the money to buy luxury cars, real estate, jewelry and international vacations, with some of the funds also sent overseas and potentially into the hands of Islamic terrorists. \"This is on my watch, I am accountable for this and, more importantly, I am the one that will fix it,\" Walz told reporters in December, as he took responsibility for the scandal. Nearly a dozen Republicans who are running to succeed Walz in the governor's office are making the fraud scandal central to their campaigns. And on Thursday, as expected, longtime Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar launched a gubernatorial campaign, giving her party a big boost as it aims to defend the governor's office. WALZ ON GOP CALLS FOR HIM TO RESIGN OVER FRAUD SCANDAL: ‘OVER MY DEAD BODY’ The 61-year-old Walz was raised in rural Nebraska and enlisted in the Army National Guard in 1981, soon after graduating from high school. Walz returned to Nebraska to attend Chadron State College, where he graduated in 1989 with a degree in social science education. He taught English and American History in China for one year through a program at Harvard University before being hired in 1990 as a high school teacher and football and basketball coach in Nebraska. Six years later, he moved to Mankato, Minnesota, to teach geography at Mankato West High. Walz was deployed to Italy to support Operation Enduring Freedom in 2003 before retiring two years later from the National Guard. INSIDE THE RISE AND FALL OF TIM WALZ He was elected to the House in 2006 and re-elected five times, representing Minnesota's 1st Congressional District, a mostly rural district covering the southern part of the state that includes a number of midsize cities. During his last two years on Capitol Hill, he served as ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. Walz won election as governor in 2018 and re-election four years later. But Walz was unknown to many Americans when then-Vice President Kamala Harris chose the Minnesota governor as her running mate in the summer of 2024, soon after she replaced then-President Joe Biden as the Democrats' presidential nominee. Walz, during his three months as running mate, visually and vocally embraced the traditional role of political attack dog that has long been associated with vice presidential nominees. But Harris and Walz fell short, losing the November 2024 election to Trump and now-Vice President JD Vance, as the Democratic Party ticket was swept in all seven crucial battleground states. Pundits considered Walz a possible contender for the Democratic Party's 2028 presidential nomination.

And the ongoing fraud scandal and his decision to end his gubernatorial re-election put an end to Walz's recent tenure in national politics.","summary":"Minnesota Gov.

In a filing in the Federal Register, the Trump administration outlined gifts given to President Biden in Fiscal Year 2024, including a sculpture made from a fragment of the Notre Dame in Paris, a decorative tea set and a sterling silver metal train set. The State Department's Office of the Chief of Protocol publishes the list yearly of items worth at least $480 given to the president, White House officials and administration officials and those in senior roles across the federal government. Many of the gifts are handed over to the National Archives for safekeeping, rather than remaining with their respective recipients, including the Bidens. The 2024 list has significance in that it is a glimpse into the last year of the Biden administration. First lady Jill Biden and President Joe Biden greet Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff at the White House ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump on January 20, 2025, in Washington. Full List of Gifts to Biden White House 2024 The most expensive item recorded was a $19,000 painting, titled “Marimba,“ from Angola's president to President Biden in the last few weeks of his presidency. Biden was also given a sterling silver train set worth $7,750 from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a road bike and two crates of dates worth $7,089 from United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The dates were disposed of by the Secret Service, while the other items made their way to the National Archives, along with $3,300 in photographs and artwork from the prime minister of the Czech Republic, $3,000 in sculpture, photographs, posters and books from President Emmanuel Macron of France and a $3,300 sculpture of a winged woman by the prime minister of Iraq. Jill Biden was given a bottle of Ormonde Jayne perfume and an 18-carat gold necklace with diamonds from the emir of Qatar and his spouse. Worth roughly $11,165, these were the most expensive gifts on her list, along with other items of jewelry, some of which her husband purchased in order to keep them. Harris also received a variety of gifts, including books, a clock, ceramics and a painting, but none were worth more than $2,700. All items were transferred to the National Archives. Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, had two gifts recorded: two sets of cufflinks, a tie holder and a large Kente blanket. The list also covers items gifted to members of Biden's Cabinet, including cufflinks and a gold coin for former Secretary of State Antony Blinken, artwork for former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director William Burns and statues, binoculars and a fountain pen among the items for former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.

Most gifts are transferred to the National Archives or General Services Administration and not kept by the recipient unless they choose to reimburse the Treasury for them or in rare cases keep them for official use.\n\nBiden’s most expensive gift: A $19,000 painting from Angola’s president\n\nBiden received an acrylic painting titled “Marimba” by the noted Angolan artist Guizef Guilherme, which had an estimated value of $19,000 and was sent to the archives.\n\nPerhaps more unusually, Biden was gifted a sterling silver train set worth $7,750 from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a road bike and two crates of dates worth $7,089 from United Arab Emirates president, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The train set and bike were both transferred to the archives while the dates were disposed of by the Secret Service, the report says.\n\nOther high-dollar gifts given to the former president include:\n\n— A $3,300 sculpture of a winged woman by the prime minister of Iraq\n\n— $3,300 in photographs and artwork from the prime minister of the Czech Republic\n\n— $3,000 in sculpture, photographs, posters and books from President Emmanuel Macron of France\n\n— $2,512 worth of assorted presents, including aviator sunglasses, wine, a cookbook, cufflinks and a commemorative Nutella jar from Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.\n\nAll of those items were sent to the archives with the exception of the perishables, which were destroyed.\n\nJill Biden’s most expensive gift: Diamond necklace and perfume worth $11,165 from the emir of Qatar\n\nBiden’s wife, former first lady Jill Biden, received a bottle of Ormonde Jayne perfume and an 18-carat gold necklace with diamonds from the emir of Qatar and his spouse. The combined gift was estimated to be worth $11,165, and the report did not break down the individual value of the two items.\n\nShe kept the perfume bottle after the liquid was disposed of, but the necklace went to the National Archives.\n\nJill Biden also reported receiving a Dior bracelet and Sevres vase from Macron’s wife, Brigitte, in a combined gift valued at $5,090.

JB Pritzker.\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo, Carville emphasized that Democrats need to ask themselves “two really important questions” to win over the nomination.\n\nThe first, according to Carville, is whether they can “raise a lot of early money.”\n\n“Because no matter how they set it up... when it happens, it happens quickly,” Carville said in comments released Wednesday.\n\nCarville pointed to Pritzker, California Gov.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) could run, but said that she has “talent.”\n\nWhile no Democrat has yet to announce whether they plan on launching a future bid, a band of Democrats including Harris, Newsom and Pritzker, have been floated as potential contenders in early polls.\n\nDuring the interview, Carville stressed for the party to do “what is necessary” to win the election.\n\n“Politics is not about being pure,” he said. “It’s not about having a rooted ideology. It’s about winning, and winning is its own cause. ”","summary":"The Democratic consultant said early fundraising and winning the Black vote are key factors in his prediction for the next presidential nomination.","url":"https://www.nj.com/politics/2026/01/top-strategist-says-harris-has-no-chance-in-2028-and-names-1-surprising-alternative.html","image":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/VDCI6MSFCRA77HTU53ORWTFCTM.jpg?auth=a43ddc312f581ea15b20890127aed2ef67aa9ee784b8f12badfca486787e649e&width=1280&smart=true&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 19:45:00","author":"Rachel Cohen","authors":["Rachel Cohen"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.36},{"id":397478906,"title":"'Line In The Sand': Democrats Break With Party Over Gender Ideology, Face Legal Fight In Illinois","text":"For years, Democrats for an Informed Approach to Gender (DIAG) tried to do what they believed responsible citizens were supposed to do: engage with their own party, raise concerns and advocate for change from within — particularly when it comes to the party's unwavering allegiance to radical gender ideology. Instead, they hit a wall. \"Trying to get engagement from any elected Democrat on this issue is like hitting your head against a brick wall,\" DIAG board secretary Jenny Poyer Ackerman told OutKick. Now, that internal party conflict has spilled into court. On Tuesday, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) filed a First Amendment lawsuit against Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias, challenging a state law that bars organizations from using the words \"Democrat\" or \"Republican\" in their name unless they receive approval from party leadership. DIAG — an all-volunteer nonprofit made up largely of lifelong Democrats — was blocked from registering in Illinois because it refused to obtain permission from the Illinois Democratic Party. Without that approval, the group could face fines or jail time for engaging in protected political speech in the state. \"The Illinois Democratic Party doesn’t get to decide whether we can call ourselves ‘Democrats,’\" Ackerman said in a statement. \"DIAG was founded on our belief in open inquiry, challenging ideological conformity, and above all, the freedom to speak out. Backing down would go against everything we believe in.\" But for Ackerman and the parents behind DIAG, the lawsuit is about far more than a name. A Breaking Point Inside The Party DIAG was founded by parents whose children adopted transgender identities during COVID lockdowns — a period Ackerman says coincided with \"a huge increase in the number of kids presenting themselves as transgender.\" \"What happens is that you find it surprisingly difficult to find objective information about how to help your kid when this happens,\" she told OutKick. \"And when you discover that you’re not supposed to ask any questions — you’re just supposed to affirm and march her to the gender clinic where they’re going to suppress her puberty and then start giving her steroids — this becomes a line in the sand.\" Ackerman stressed that, for most parents, this isn't a political issue at all. \"If your middle schooler comes home one day and tells you she suddenly realizes she’s been living in the wrong body, I guarantee you will not see this as a political problem,\" she said. \"You will see it as something that needs attention.\" That line, she said, has increasingly been drawn around women's sports. And it's a reality that has been front and center for OutKick readers, particularly as courts, lawmakers, and sports governing bodies grapple with whether biological males should be allowed to compete in girls' and women's categories. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in two cases involving trans-identifying male athletes in girls' school sports. During the hearings, DIAG representatives attended rallies outside the Supreme Court, where female athletes spoke out about being displaced in their own fields, gymnasiums and locker rooms. \"The young women who came — the athletes who came from all over the country to express their feelings about this experience they’ve been dealt — was incredibly powerful,\" she said. \"They didn’t all have big, booming voices, but they really did manage to prevail.\" DIAG Is Currently Registered In More Than 40 States \"Illinois is the only state that has rejected us because we call ourselves Democrats,\" Ackerman said, calling the rule \"a really dumb relic.\" That rejection is what prompted the lawsuit. \"Illinois can’t get around the First Amendment by outsourcing censorship to party bosses,\" FIRE attorney Daniel Zahn said in a statement. \"No American — Republican, Democrat, or Independent — should have to bend the knee before a political party to participate in the political system.\" For DIAG, seeking permission from the Democratic Party was never an option. \"They refuse on principle to seek permission from the very party they plan to criticize,\" the complaint states. And there's a very real fear of retaliation among Democrats who are critical of gender ideology. Ackerman said that's why many DIAG supporters choose to remain anonymous. \"People feel that they need to be anonymous because maybe their jobs would be jeopardized, or sometimes their family relationships could be made much more tense if everyone knew how they felt about this,\" she said. \"It’s just very fraught.\" Political Consequences For Democrats The issue of protecting women's sports and sex-based spaces has consistently polled as an 80/20 issue. But Ackerman believes Democratic leadership is increasingly boxed in by the most passionate trans activist voices — even when they don't represent the majority. \"When someone like Congressman Seth Moulton goes out on a limb and says something as anodyne as ‘I wouldn’t want one of my daughters to get mowed down by a boy on the soccer field,’ my hunch is that for every letter of support he gets, he might get 10 anguished pleas saying, ‘Please resist the MAGA extremists who would deny our child’s right to exist,’\" she said. That dynamic, she believes, has real electoral consequences. And we saw it play out in 2024, when Trump defeated Kamala Harris in a landslide. \"I don’t just worry about it — I see it all over,\" Ackerman said. \"I couldn’t bring myself to vote for a single Democrat in the last election.\" She emphasized that doesn't make DIAG a Republican group, either. \"We exist not just to aggregate Democratic voters who are mad as hell and want to talk about it,\" she said, \"but also to be a resource to Democratic electeds and candidates who we want to regain contact with reality.\" Whether Democratic leadership is willing to listen remains to be seen. But a growing number of Democrats are clearly done being told that questioning gender ideology — particularly when it affects their children and women’s sports — makes them outsiders in their own party.","summary":"A group of lifelong Democrats says radical gender ideology — from women&apos;s sports to pediatric care — pushed them to a breaking point.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/democrats-break-party-gender-ideology-legal-fight-illinois","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2026/01/display-media-33.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 19:40:42","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.217},{"id":397472938,"title":"White House dismisses ‘irrelevant’ Springsteen song about Minneapolis","text":"“I wrote this song on Saturday, recorded it yesterday and released it to you today in response to the state terror being visited on the city of Minneapolis,” Springsteen said in a statement. “It’s dedicated to the people of Minneapolis, our innocent immigrant neighbors and in memory of Alex Pretti and Renee Good.

And if other sections are diminished, we all are,” bureau chief Matt Viser wrote in one of the Post’s internal Slack channels on Thursday morning.\n\nThe accompanying letter, signed by Viser and all seven other White House reporters, makes the case for a “diversified Washington Post.” And it tries to speak Bezos’s language, appealing to him with data and a determination to grow the Post.\n\n“In a typical month,” the letter said, “some of us have found that more than half of the new subscribers we brought to The Post came from stories and scoops that relied on desks such as International and Metro.”\n\nThose stories included recent scoops about the US military action in Venezuela and U.S. President Donald Trump’s demolition of the East Wing.\n\n“Our colleagues’ work helps lift up our own,” the reporters wrote.\n\nA spokesperson for The Post declined comment to CNN about the looming layoffs.\n\nThe incoming cuts…\n\nThe unusual public pleas to Bezos have come after several private signals about imminent cuts, including an internal memo saying the Post no longer planned to send any reporters to the Winter Olympics in February.\n\nReporters fear that the Post is slashing its way to irrelevance; moreover, they wonder whether Bezos, who bought the publication more than a decade ago, cares about it anymore.\n\nThus, the staffers are going over the head of the Post’s publisher, Will Lewis, and trying to get Bezos’s attention directly.\n\nInternational correspondents, anticipating reductions to their ranks, wrote to Bezos last weekend and said “robust, powerful foreign coverage is essential to the Washington Post’s brand and its future success in whatever form the paper takes moving forward.”\n\nA second letter, from more than two dozen D.C.-area beat reporters, emphasized the importance of local coverage. “Should you allow Post management to lay off the local staff, which has been cut in half in the last five years, the effect on this region and the people in it will be immeasurable,” the reporters wrote.\n\nThe new letter from the White House reporters is a bit different because there is no indication that their jobs are at risk.\n\nInstead, Lewis has spoken privately about focusing the Post’s investment on politics and a few other key areas, while cutting back in areas like sports and foreign affairs.\n\n“But some of our most impactful, most-read articles… have relied on collaboration with all corners of the newsroom,” the White House reporters told Bezos.\n\nAfter several tumultuous years and previous rounds of staff reductions, reporters who have stayed at the Post, even when offered buyout opportunities to leave, say the staff is at a breaking point.\n\n“There’s now a strong sense that neither Jeff Bezos nor Will Lewis are serious, good-faith stewards of The Washington Post,” one veteran correspondent said.\n\nThe person pointed out that Bezos made changes to the Opinion section that cost the Post dearly. Bezos axed a planned editorial page endorsement of Kamala Harris in late 2024, leading to mass cancellations by concerned subscribers, and then announced a more Trump-aligned mission for the Opinion pages in early 2025, causing even more upheaval.\n\nBezos and Lewis “drove us into a ditch with their decisions, particularly the reinvention of the Opinion section, costing us hundreds of thousands of subscribers,” the correspondent said. “Now it looks like the staff will pay for it.”","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/article/washington-posts-white-house-team-urges-jeff-bezos-to-halt-massive-newsroom-cuts/","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/resizer/v2/DVLXOVMXOREDNDC2CBSZZJNOTI.JPG?auth=55dfdca0d84893a633a5d9f75547e75db8f05e86293eda7509ea169cde82b6d5","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 19:25:04","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.102},{"id":397467792,"title":"Embattled MN Gov. Makes Big Announcement About Political Future, but What He Leaves Out Is Pure Walz","text":"What can be said about Minnesota Governor Tim Walz that hasn't already been said?\n\nI mean, the guy was a walking and talking buffoon throughout his miserable 2024 vice-presidential campaign, as the sidekick of the equally-miserable Democrat presidential nominee, former Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nNow he says he wouldn't have done anything differently, and that he's done with elected office — forever.\n\nLet's refresh our memory on Gov. Jazz Hands: From lying about his less-than-heroic past to his melodramatic performance theater to dancing and flitting around a stage like a sprite from a ridiculous made-up movie, Dance of the Pixies, the guy who nobody takes seriously is a silly caricature of himself.\n\nThen came the reports of massive fraud in Minnesota, followed by ever-more violent *protests* against federal agents in Minneapolis — for the horrific crime of legally doing their jobs while rounding up \"the worst of the worst\" illegal aliens in out-of-control Minneapolis.\n\nSimply put, Walz has been in over his head since the moment he entered politics, while now continuing to dive even deeper into the depths of irrelevance — not to mention the possibility of becoming a convicted criminal due to his possible (probable?) role in the massive fraud that continues to rock his state and its residents.\n\nIn an interview with MN NOW (formerly, MSNBC), host Jacob Soboroff asked the embattled governor if, when he looks back, he thinks he could have done anything differently to prevent federal agents from coming to Minneapolis. Needless to say, Walz — who passes the buck like it's a glowing volcanic rock, of course said \"no\".\n\nNo. No. They were coming anyway. We had -- this was -- it was all make-believe that we'd been at it. Every state had this. And, look, I do think there has to be accountability in this. No one in state government was implicated. This happens all over. People did this. We find — we got it caught. We put them in jail or whatever.\n\nWho has Walz put in jail for the mayhem in Minneapolis, much less for the billions of dollars of fraud that blew the lid off the corruption in the state? Perhaps realizing the ridiculousness of his denial of responsibility (although I doubt it), the governor then tried to change his tune about responsibility — which only made him look more disingenuous:\n\nBut somebody needs to be accountable. And I said, you know what? You're right. I'm accountable for this. Let me, this year, get this all fixed, which we will have the strongest programs. We're already doing it. But the people they had that were prosecuting these cases, those people that were over at the U.S. attorney's office, they all quit. \n\nThe notion that Walz thinks his party sees him as he sees himself is laughable in and of itself. Truth be told, I'd wager, the Democrat Party as a whole wishes Walz — along with Harris — would ride off into the sunset and never return.\n\nLike Harris, Walz appears to just make things up as he goes, only to end up saying nothing — other than running from responsibility like it's an active volcano.\n\nMORE WALZ NONSENSE: Walz Reiterates Priorities in Face-Off With Border Czar Tom Homan\n\nNow, the Political *Bombshell* (Yawn)\n\nAfter making everything about himself, which has been his modus operandi from the beginning, Walz slid into an announcement about his political future, almost as if he tried to make it a mere footnote. \n\nSaying his time as an elected official will permanently end when he finishes his term as governor, Governor Dufus declared:\n\nI will never run for an elected office again. \n\nNo kidding, Tim? \n\nNot to be rude, but given the history of your governorship, including the current mayhem in Minneapolis, and not to mention your clownish behavior as your party's 2024 vice-presidential nominee, your announcement comes across more as a \"well, duh,\" than news. \n\nI mean, sure, this guy has known for a while that his political career was over as the massive fraud case continued to grow. Then again, Walz is among the most delusional and dishonest political figures to come down the pike in recent years.\n\nSo what does Tim Walz do? He tries to slither out the back door, as if it's him who has been treated unfairly.Don't let the door hit you, Timmy.\n\nEditor's Note: The mainstream media isn't interested in the facts; they're only interested in attacking the president.

Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff, first elected in 2021, is running for reelection in one of the nation’s closest battlegrounds. Republican candidates include Representative Buddy Carter, Representative Mike Collins and Derek Dooley, a former college football coach with strong ties to Governor Brian Kemp. A Collins spokesperson responded to the update in a statement to Newsweek, saying that anyone who “fails to recognize“ Georgia as Republicans' most likely pickup opportunity “is disconnected from the reality on the ground.“ Newsweek reached out to the Ossoff, Carter and Dooley campaigns for comment. Why It Matters The party in the White House typically loses seats in the midterms, so Democrats are hopeful about winning GOP-held seats in November. But Georgia presents Republicans an opportunity to flip a seat in a state President Donald Trump carried by just over two points in the 2024 presidential race. If Republicans manage to flip Georgia, it would complicate Democrats’ already difficult path to a Senate majority. What To Know Sabato’s Crystal Ball announced that they are reclassifying the race from a pure toss-up to “Leans Democrat” on Thursday, a positive sign for Ossoff but a red flag for Republicans about their chances in the state. Still, analyst Kyle Kondik wrote in the update that Democrats could face some challenges. The state still has “a little streak of red mixed with its purple,” and it’s “reasonable” to question if Ossoff can generate the level of Black voter turnout needed to win the state, he wrote, adding that it should still be a “Democratic-leaning year overall.” Senator Jon Ossoff, a Georgia Democrat, speaks on May 29, 2025, in Atlanta. “Ultimately if Democrats could win Georgia Senate races in a pair of 2020 runoffs as well as in the 2022 midterm, they should be favored to do so in a 2026 midterm, too, particularly when the GOP is not guaranteed to produce a very strong challenger. So this race moves from Toss-up to Leans Democratic,” he wrote. The race is likely to be decided by only a few points, but Ossoff “is likelier to end up on the winning side of that margin,” Kondik wrote. Georgia’s political landscape has shifted dramatically in recent years, with Democrats winning both Senate seats in recent elections, but Republicans maintaining control of statewide offices and the legislature. Georgia was viewed as more conservative for most of the 21st century, but has emerged as a premier battleground. Former President Joe Biden narrowly won the state in 2020. The race is further complicated by Georgia’s runoff system, which requires a candidate to win a majority to avoid a December runoff. The primary is scheduled for May 19, 2026, with a potential runoff in June, and the general election on November 3, 2026. Kerwin Swint, a political scientist at Kennesaw State University, told Newsweek the shift was likely the “right call.” “Although Jon Ossoff is vulnerable as a liberal Democrat in a center-right state, incumbent U.S. senators are very difficult to beat,” he said. “He also has a fundraising advantage going into the general election this fall.” Democratic enthusiasm will benefit Ossoff, and Republicans will have to “keep up pace” in addition to keeping up with his fundraising, Swint said. “The main issue of course will be the economy and cost of living, in addition to immigration and John Ossoff’s strong support for Joe Biden’s policies. It’s been a toss up, but moving it to Lean Democrat is the right call in my opinion, although there is plenty of opportunity for a Republican nominee to make advances this fall,” he said. Jon Ossoff’s Chances of Reelection, According to Polls Polling in Georgia has been sparse over recent months, but some polls from the fall and summer of 2025 showed Ossoff with a lead over his potential Republican challengers. The latest public poll of the race was conducted by Quantus Insights. It found Ossoff with a lead over Carter (40 percent to 37 percent) and Dooley (42 percent to 35 percent). However, he was in a dead heat with Collins, with each receiving 38 percent in that survey. It surveyed 624 registered and likely voters from September 9-12, 2025 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points. Meanwhile, a TIPP Insights poll showed Ossoff with a three-point lead over Collins (44 percent to 41 percent), a four-point lead over Carter (44 percent to 40 percent) and a five-point lead over Dooley (44 percent to 39 percent). It surveyed 2,956 registered voters from July 28-August 1, 2025 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 1.8 percentage points. Democrats Face Challenging 2026 Senate Map Republicans currently hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, meaning Democrats must flip three seats for a tie and four for an outright majority. Maine and North Carolina present Democrats their strongest opportunities to flip a seat. Maine backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by about seven points, while North Carolina backed Trump by about three points. In Maine, GOP Senator Susan Collins is seeking a sixth term as the only Republican senator in a state that Harris won in 2024. Despite the state’s Democratic lean, Collins, a centrist who has been more critical of the Trump administration than other Republicans, has won tough environments in the past. Senator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, is not running for reelection. Former Democratic Governor Roy Cooper and Republican Michael Whatley are notable candidates running to replace him. If Democrats win each of those races, they would still be in the minority. That means they must turn to more conservative territory like Alaska to win. Democrats are also eyeing double-digit Trump states like Alaska, Iowa, Ohio and Texas as potential flip opportunities. Sabato’s Crystal Ball also reclassified the Senate race in Florida, an increasingly conservative state, from Safe Republican to Likely Republican. “To be clear, we don’t see this as a top-tier race—Florida has very clearly moved to the right even as some reversion seems likely this cycle, and much more than money is needed for Democrats to really put this race into play. But we thought it merited inclusion along with the other Likely Republican Senate races,” Kondik wrote. What People Are Saying A Collins campaign spokesperson told Newsweek, citing an article from May 2025: “Mr. Sabato has been among those hardest hit by TDS and does all he can to pontificate to boost Democrat fundraising emails. We agree with Newsweek’s May 22, 2025 assessment that Mike Collins is the biggest stumbling block for Jon Ossoff, as well as with the public surveys showing the two are tied or statistically tied. Anyone who fails to recognize the Georgia Senate race as the most likely pickup opportunity for Republicans is disconnected from the reality on the ground.“ Sabato’s Crystal Ball analyst Kyle Kondik wrote: “While Democrats have made progress over the course of the last year in positioning themselves to compete in enough Republican-held seats to win the majority, the GOP nonetheless remains favored to hold that majority. The basic asset for Republicans, and problem for Democrats, is the structure of the Senate map. With Republicans having knocked out all of the remaining Democrats from states that voted for Donald Trump all three times he was on the ballot—a group of 25 states that accounts for half of all the Senate seats—Democrats either have to start winning in redder states again or, over time, essentially sweep all of the Senate seats in blue and purple states. National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) regional press secretary Nick Puglia previously told Newsweek: “Democrats are the most unpopular they’ve ever been because candidates like Jon Ossoff have nothing to offer the American people except a promise of returning to open borders, wasted taxpayer spending that drove up prices, and hatred for President Trump. American families deserve better, and Senate Republicans will continue fighting for safer communities, lower costs and more money in your pocket.” What Happens Next Betting odd markets give Ossoff an advantage. Kalshi’s odds showed Ossoff with an 81 percent chance of victory, while Polymarket gave Democrats an 83 percent chance of carrying the state in this year’s Senate elections.","summary":"One forecaster now gives Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff an advantage in his reelection bid in Georgia.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-get-warning-key-senate-race-midterms-georgia-11438291","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2217754583.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 18:58:50","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.088},{"id":397453338,"title":"Biden administration reports jewelry and art given by foreign officials","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Foreign leaders and governments presented to former President Joe Biden, his wife, U.S. Cabinet members and other senior officials tens of thousands of dollars in gifts in the last year of the Biden administration, including a $19,000 painting, an $11,000 necklace, a $5,000 bracelet and in one case $15,000 in cash, according to the latest accounting from the State Department.\n\nThe annual report, published Thursday in the Federal Register by the department’s Bureau of Protocol, covers calendar year 2024 and does not include any gifts given to President Donald Trump or his administration in the first year of Trump’s second term.\n\nFederal employees are required to report gifts they receive from foreign officials that are worth more than $480. Most gifts are transferred to the National Archives or General Services Administration and not kept by the recipient unless they choose to reimburse the Treasury for them or in rare cases keep them for official use.\n\nBiden’s most expensive gift: A $19,000 painting from Angola’s president\n\nBiden received an acrylic painting titled “Marimba” by the noted Angolan artist Guizef Guilherme, which had an estimated value of $19,000 and was sent to the archives.\n\nPerhaps more unusually, Biden was gifted a sterling silver train set worth $7,750 from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a road bike and two crates of dates worth $7,089 from United Arab Emirates president, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The train set and bike were both transferred to the archives while the dates were disposed of by the Secret Service, the report says.\n\nOther high-dollar gifts given to the former president include:\n\n— A $3,300 sculpture of a winged woman by the prime minister of Iraq\n\n— $3,300 in photographs and artwork from the prime minister of the Czech Republic\n\n— $3,000 in sculpture, photographs, posters and books from President Emmanuel Macron of France\n\n— $2,512 worth of assorted presents, including aviator sunglasses, wine, a cookbook, cufflinks and a commemorative Nutella jar from Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. \n\nAll of those items were sent to the archives with the exception of the perishables, which were destroyed.\n\nJill Biden’s most expensive gift: Diamond necklace and perfume worth $11,165 from the emir of Qatar\n\nBiden’s wife, former first lady Jill Biden, received a bottle of Ormonde Jayne perfume and an 18-carat gold necklace with diamonds from the emir of Qatar and his spouse. The combined gift was estimated to be worth $11,165, and the report did not break down the individual value of the two items.\n\nShe kept the perfume bottle after the liquid was disposed of, but the necklace went to the National Archives.\n\nJill Biden also reported receiving a Dior bracelet and Sevres vase from Macron’s wife, Brigitte, in a combined gift valued at $5,090. Biden purchased the bracelet but sent the vase to the archives. The report did not give the individual value of the two items.\n\nHarris’ most expensive gift: Rug, book and cooking utensils worth $2,633 from the United Arab Emirates\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris received a number of pricey gifts, but none were reported to be worth more than $2,700. \n\nThe biggest was a rug, cooking utensils, and a book valued at $2,633 from the United Arab Emirates. She also received:\n\n— A book and clock from the crown prince of Bahrain valued at $1,775\n\n— A ceramic bowl from the first lady of South Korea valued at $1,440\n\n— A painting from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy worth $1,460. \n\nAll were transferred to the National Archives.\n\nDefense secretary given $3,700 bronze statue, while CIA chief was gifted $3,000 horse saddle\n\nFormer Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin reported receiving several high-value gifts, including a $3,700 bronze statue from his Indian counterpart, binoculars worth $2,950 from his Qatari counterpart and a $1,300 watercolor painting from the prime minister of Iraq. All were to be transferred to the General Services Administration.\n\nAt the CIA, former director William Burns reported receiving a $3,000 horse saddle from a senior Kazakh official that was retained for official use. \n\nSeveral of his employees, who are not required to be named in the document, reported gifts that were also kept for “official use,” including $2,390 in tickets for a Formula One race and a concert by hip-hop star Teddy Swims as well as a $543 box of Swedish/Cuban cigars.\n\nAnother CIA employee reported receiving $15,000 in cash from an unnamed foreign government official. The money was given to the Federal Reserve, according to the report.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Antony Blinken reported only a handful of gifts in 2024, none of them valued at more than $800. All of those were sent to the GSA for potential use in government facilities.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/biden-foreign-gifts-diplomacy-harris-74b54e038729d00ca085598fc5568d02","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/d7b61d2/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5371x3581+0+0/resize/980x653!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F74%2F1c%2F167e6fac9073289db34bfa4c6210%2Fccfc827976a440b4bac92c3d26854cda","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 18:56:31","author":"Matthew Lee","authors":["Matthew Lee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.063},{"id":397454638,"title":"Lizzo shows off thinnest-ever frame yet as she holds hands with boyfriend Myke Wright on rare night out","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Jan 29th 2026\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStunning Epstein twist as Ghislaine Maxwell claims 29 friends cut 'secret deals' with DOJ\n\nWoman thought it was a 'prank' when she saw schoolboy Noah Donohoe cycling naked on day he disappeared, inquest hears\n\nSex crimes soar to record levels with average of 588 every day, while drug offences and shoplifting continue to rise in new official stats\n\nThe food influencer class war: How Britain's poshest restaurant critics Topjaw are locked in a bitter fallout with burger chef who tells Mail about entitled behaviour - and why they 'crossed the line'\n\nI saw Olivia Attwood and Bradley Dack just days before their split.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy DEIRDRE SIMONDS \n Published:17:25 GMT, 29 January 2026 |Updated:18:51 GMT, 29 January 2026 \n\nLizzo stepped out looking confident and radiant as she enjoyed a stylish night out with boyfriend Myke Wright in Los Angeles after attending his art gallery event.\nThe Grammy-winning singer, 37, flashed a bright smile as she exited the venue alongside Wright, cutting a glamorous figure in a shimmering silver mini dress with a daring keyhole neckline, sheer black tights and pointed heels. \nShe accessorized with hoop earrings and a sleek black clutch, while Wright opted for a relaxed yet polished look in black trousers, a white T-shirt and a blazer, completing the outfit with tinted sunglasses.\nThe couple appeared at ease as they walked side by side, with Lizzo visibly beaming as they made their way through the crowd.\nLizzo and Wright first met in 2016 while hosting MTV’s Wonderland, where she served as the music correspondent and he took on the comedy role. \nTheir friendship eventually blossomed into romance, and they were first spotted together publicly in 2021.\n\nLizzo stepped out looking confident and radiant as she enjoyed a stylish night out with boyfriend Myke Wright in Los Angeles after attending his art gallery event\nDespite their growing visibility, the pair have largely kept their relationship private.\nIn March 2025, the singer appeared on Andy Cohen’s self-titled SiriusXM radio show, where she jokingly called out the host for previously putting her relationship on blast during a 2022 interview.\n\n Lizzo admits she got 'tired of living' as she opens up about the lowest point of her life \n‘I really got beef with you because the last time we saw each other you f***ing outed me,’ Lizzo recalled with a laugh, referencing the moment Cohen asked whether she was “in love” with Wright while he was sitting in the room.\nCohen admitted he had ‘stepped in s**t,’ saying he had no idea the question would reveal her relationship status.\n‘I outed you,’ he acknowledged.\nLizzo later explained she felt caught off guard at the time.\n‘I was in such a weird position because, like, we’re so private,’ she said. ‘But he was there and I was like, “I don’t want to say ‘no’ because I don’t want to hurt him.”’\nWhile the incident didn’t cause issues between the couple, Lizzo noted it sparked widespread public attention.\n‘It started s**t with the world, though,’ she said. ‘I think when the world sees two happy people, they want to destroy them.’\n\nThe Grammy winner, 37, flashed a bright smile as she exited the venue alongside Wright, cutting a glamorous figure in a shimmering gold mini dress with a daring keyhole neckline\n\nLizzo has achieved significant weight loss, reporting she losing 16% of her body fat (pictured in 2020)\n\nShe later offered further insight into their relationship during an appearance on Jake Shane’s Therapuss podcast in May, describing their romance as a classic ‘friends-to-lovers trope.’ ‘We both worked on this TV show for MTV,’ she explained. ‘I was the music girl, he was the comedy guy, and I was just like, “He’s my best friend.”’ \n‘I was like, “Wow, I can really talk to him,”’ she added. ‘We had this crazy bond for years, and I do love that we were friends first. That means we can talk about anything.’\nLizzo’s latest sighting comes after she opened up candidly about the darkest period of her life while posing for the cover of Women’s Health UK in August.\nThe singer revealed she battled depression after facing multiple lawsuits in 2023 from former dancers who accused her of sexual harassment and fostering a hostile work environment.\nAt the time, she vehemently denied the claims, which she described as ‘outrageous’ and ‘unbelievable.’\n\nLizzo and Wright first met in 2016 while hosting MTV’s Wonderland, where she served as the music correspondent and he took on the comedy role; seen in November 2025\n\nLizzo recently spoke openly about her body image and past struggles with binge eating, revealing she has lost 60 pounds over the past 14 months through diet and exercise\nThe lawsuit was ultimately dropped in December 2024, according to a report from The Post.\nWhile reflecting on that chapter, Lizzo admitted it marked her ‘lowest’ point. \n‘It got to the point where it’s just like, well… You ever get tired of living?’ she said. ‘It got to the point where I was like, “I could die.”’\nShe clarified that she never attempted to harm herself, but struggled deeply with public scrutiny.\n‘If everyone hates you and thinks you’re a terrible person, then what’s the point?’ she recalled thinking.\n\nDespite the physical changes, she emphasized that her philosophy around body positivity remains unchanged (pictured in 2021)\nElsewhere in the interview, Lizzo spoke openly about her body image and past struggles with binge eating, revealing she has lost 60 pounds over the past 14 months through diet and exercise.\nDespite the physical changes, she emphasized that her philosophy around body positivity remains unchanged.\n‘I still think I’m big. I’m still wearing plus-size clothing. I have the same rolls,’ she said. ‘Body positivity is the radical act of daring to exist loudly and proudly in a society that told you you shouldn’t exist.’\nLizzo also reflected on learning to let go of relying on external validation, saying she now finds confidence from within.\n‘I’m proud of the person I’ve become,’ she said. ‘I feel like I’ve turned everything I’ve been through into growth.’ \nLos Angeles\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLizzo shows off thinnest-ever frame yet as she holds hands with boyfriend Myke Wright on rare night out\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 17\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

(AP) — San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan on Thursday announced he’s joining the crowded race for California governor, casting himself as a moderate Democrat with a track record of tackling some of the state’s most persistent issues including homelessness and crime.\n\nElected to lead Silicon Valley’s largest city in 2022, Mahan said his policies have reduced the number of unsheltered homeless in the city, cut fees to speed up housing construction and helped police solve more homicides.\n\nMahan joins a large and unsettled field of contenders hoping to replace Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nMonths ahead of the June primary, no Democrat has emerged as a clear frontrunner. The race includes former Biden administration Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, former U.S. House member Katie Porter, and U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell, among others. Republican Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and conservative commentator Steve Hilton have also announced their bids.\n\nMahan has emerged as a frequent critic of Newsom. He lambasted Newsom over his handling of homelessness and bucked him in 2024 by backing a tough-on-crime ballot measure to increase penalties for some shoplifting and drug offenses. Mahan also criticized Newsom’s focus on President Donald Trump and the governor’s social media trolling in an op-ed last year. \n\n“I’m running to bring focus back to government. To give cities the tools they need to succeed. To show that the best resistance to division is results,” Mahan said in a post announcing his candidacy. “And to prove that California can work again — for everyone.”\n\nNewsom, who’s seen as a potential 2028 presidential candidate, is termed out after this year and cannot run for reelection. Other Democratic heavyweights, including former Vice President Kamala Harris and Attorney General Rob Bonta, decided not to run.\n\nMahan, a 43-year-old Harvard graduate, has deep ties with the tech industry. He was a tech entrepreneur before he ran for public offices, co-founding a digital political organizing platform called Brigade. He was classmates with Mark Zuckerberg, who Mahan said persuaded him to go into tech instead of law school. Some tech and business leaders, including billionaire Rick Caruso, venture capitalist Garry Tan and angel investor Matt Brezina, already signaled they would support Mahan’s bid. \n\nMahan in recent months also hosted a number of gubernatorial candidates in San Jose, but said no one has impressed him. Mahan was first elected as a city councilmember in 2020 before he won the mayoral election in 2022 against a labor-backed candidate. \n\nHe often joins weekend clean-up efforts along San Jose waterways and city parks. Last year, over opposition from county officials, he successfully pushed a provision to make homeless people eligible for arrest if they reject three offers of shelters.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/california-governor-race-matt-mahan-219b8085a1f1f6400f6f0f13707274b4","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/d6bdc0c/2147483647/strip/false/crop/4808x3206+0+0/resize/980x653!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fd2%2F83%2F9809d088da22901dcd7d337ba030%2Ff2e63bf080fd4ae09418516dc3bb8edf","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 18:39:25","author":"Trân Nguyễn","authors":["Trân Nguyễn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.055},{"id":397454642,"title":"The Beatles Cinematic Event FIRST LOOK: Paul Mescal and Barry Keoghan are seen as Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr for the first time in startlingly accurate images from ambitious four-part anthology","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Jan 29th 2026\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStunning Epstein twist as Ghislaine Maxwell claims 29 friends cut 'secret deals' with DOJ\n\nWoman thought it was a 'prank' when she saw schoolboy Noah Donohoe cycling naked on day he disappeared, inquest hears\n\nSex crimes soar to record levels with average of 588 every day, while drug offences and shoplifting continue to rise in new official stats\n\nThe food influencer class war: How Britain's poshest restaurant critics Topjaw are locked in a bitter fallout with burger chef who tells Mail about entitled behaviour - and why they 'crossed the line'\n\nI saw Olivia Attwood and Bradley Dack just days before their split.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JADA BAS, TRAINEE REPORTER and JASON CHESTER, ASSISTANT SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:15:54 GMT, 29 January 2026 |Updated:18:28 GMT, 29 January 2026 \n\nPaul Mescal, Barry Keoghan, Joseph Quinn and Harris Dickinson have given Beatles fans a tantalising first glimpse at their upcoming four-part Beatles anthology in the first images of themselves in character. \nThe actors are currently working with director Sir Sam Mendes on four ambitious new films about the pioneering group's emergence from Liverpool's vibrant club scene to become the most influential band on the planet. \nWhile controversy has raged about the principal cast's suitability - Mescal will play Paul McCartney, with Dickinson starring as the late John Lennon, Quinn as George Harrison and Keoghan as Ringo Starr - first images of them in character suggest the films are in safe hands. \nThe Liverpool Institute For Performing Arts (LIPA) - co-founded by McCartney in 1996 - has shared postcards of the actors on set, giving fans an opportunity to judge for themselves. \nA first image captures Mescal as a young McCartney, the unmistakable brick walls of Liverpool's legendary Cavern Club visible as he gazes quizzically off-camera. \nThe band made a name for themselves as the underground club's resident band in the early 1960s, and it was here that the late Brian Epstein was encouraged to become their manager after watching them live for the first time, a decision that would change their lives forever. \n\nPaul Mescal is seen for the first time as Paul McCartney in a tantalising glimpse at the upcoming four-part Beatles anthology, which is scheduled for release in 2028 \n\nA first glimpse of Keoghan as drummer Ringo Starr finds him wearing a black and white spotted shirt and a psychedelic tie with a pair of headphones around his neck as he works in the studio\n\nA first glimpse of Keoghan as drummer Ringo finds him wearing a black and white spotted shirt and a psychedelic tie with a pair of headphones around his neck as he works in the studio. \nIt was a look typified by the percussionist in the late '60s, notably as they recorded their self-titled double album - referred to by fans as the 'White Album' - in 1968. \nWhile his hair was styled the same as Ringo's signature 'moptop', the actor also bore a striking facial resemblance to the drummer. \nElsewhere, Quinn appears to be shot as a bearded Harrison towards the end of the band's career, while Dickinson wears the iconic denim jacket and round spectacles favoured by Lennon in 1968. \nLIPA captioned the Instagram post: 'We’ve been given exclusive postcards promoting the new Beatles movies! We’ve hidden them around LIPA, and we want students to find them.'\nLast year, Sony finally confirmed the cast for its four highly anticipated Beatles films following months of speculation, with all four projects set for release in April 2028. \nWhite Lotus star Aimee Lou Wood will play Harrison’s wife Pattie Boyd, while Irish Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan has been cast as Linda McCartney, the muse to many of McCartney's songs.\nAnna Sawai, who has made a name for herself in the US drama series Shogun, will appear as Lennon’s wife Yoko Ono, and British actress Mia McKenna-Bruce will play Maureen Cox, the wife of Ringo.\nThe Daily Mail revealed that the Beatles biopics will be filmed at London's iconic Abbey Road Studios, with production getting underway in November last year despite earlier reports that plans had been blocked.\n\nThe Liverpool Institute For Performing Arts (LIPA) - co-founded by McCartney in 1996 - has shared postcards of the actors on set\n\nA first image captures Mescal as a young McCartney, the unmistakable brick walls of Liverpool's legendary Cavern Club visible as he gazes quizzically off-camera\n\nKeoghan's look was typified by Starr in the late '60s, notably as they recorded their self-titled double album - referred to by fans as the 'White Album' - in 1968\n\nDickinson (left) wears the iconic denim jacket and round spectacles favoured by Lennon in 1968, notably during his appearance onstage at The Rolling Stones' Rock and Roll Circus (right) \n\nThe shoulder length hair suggests Joseph Quinn has been shot as George Harrison at the end of the band's career, in 1969 \nWhile it was previously claimed that Westminster Council would not allow filming at the famous zebra crossing, the council has since confirmed to the Daily Mail that production will be going ahead.\nMendes, who is directing the films, had wanted to recreate the Beatles' 1969 album cover on the crossing.\nWestminster Council told the Daily Mail that they are, in fact, working closely with production teams to facilitate filming, which will involve closing the road.\nSpeaking at the CinemaCon convention in Las Vegas last April, an event the cast also attended, Mendes described the films as the 'first binge-able theatrical experience'.\n\nLast year, Sony finally confirmed the cast for its four highly anticipated Beatles films following months of speculation (Paul McCartney in 1965)\nThe project marks the first time Apple Corps Ltd and The Beatles – Sir Paul, Sir Ringo, and the families of Lennon and Harrison – have granted full life story and music rights for a scripted film.\nRingo previously appeared to let slip that Saltburn star Keoghan had taken on the role.\nHe told Entertainment Tonight: 'I believe he’s somewhere taking drum lessons, and I hope not too many.'\nWhen Sir Ridley Scott was promoting his second Roman epic Gladiator II, he revealed leading man Mescal was joining the Beatles project, telling an industry event that the actor was 'actually stacked up, doing the Beatles next' so he may not be able to join him on his next film.\n\nThe project marks the first time Apple Corps Ltd and The Beatles have granted full life story and music rights for a scripted film (seen in 1964)\nKeoghan recently admitted that he wasn't able to look Beatles legend Ringo in the eye during their first meeting because he was so overcome with nerves.\nWhile the actor described their meeting as 'lovely,' he told Jimmy Kimmel Live that he was so starstruck he struggled to make eye contact with the drummer.\nHe recalled: 'I met him at his house, and he played the drums for me. He asked me to play, but I wasn't playing the drums for Ringo.'\nAsked if he was able to 'study' the musician, he added: 'I was. And when I was talking to him, I couldn't look at him. I was nervous, like right now. But he's like, \"You can look at me.\"' \nDespite being nervous, Barry did stress that Ringo was 'absolutely lovely' and that they sat in the garden 'chatting away'.\n'My job is to observe and kinda taken in mannerisms and study him,' Barry added. 'I want to humanise him and bring feelings to it and not just sort of imitate.'\nThe BeatlesPaul MescalPaul McCartney\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe Beatles Cinematic Event FIRST LOOK: Paul Mescal and Barry Keoghan are seen as Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr for the first time in startlingly accurate images from ambitious four-part anthology\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 60\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

I hope you’re listening to us ask you to change your course of action swiftly and have mercy on everyone in our country.” \n\nShe then sang “Come to Mama,” from her 2016 album Joanne, which she dedicated to “everyone who is suffering, to everyone who’s feeling alone and helpless, anyone who’s lost a loved one and is having a difficult time, an impossible time, seeing when the end will be near.”\n\nThe Grammy Award winner has been vocal about politics throughout her career, most often championing LGBTQ+ rights. In 2024, she endorsed Trump’s opponent Kamala Harris for president.\n\nLady Gaga will next appear at the Grammy Awards on Sunday, where she is expected to perform, per Variety.

Email: tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy HANNAH MCDONALD, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:17:55 GMT, 29 January 2026 |Updated:17:58 GMT, 29 January 2026 \n\nNicola Peltz smouldered as she fronted a new campaign for designer Genny - after it was reported she is getting a $1million a month allowance from her father Nelson.\nThe billionaire heiress, 31, has been at the centre of a media storm since her husband Brooklyn Beckham went nuclear on his family, sharing an explosive statement saying he wants no further contact with them. \nBrushing off the drama, Nicola is again the face of Italian designer Genny for its Spring/Summer 2026 campaign. \nIn snaps for the campaign, Nicola looked stony faced as she posed in an array of glamorous ensembles. \nAmong the outfits was a baby pink oversized suit with an unbuttoned shirt, as well as a white chiffon ruffled strapless gown. \nElsewhere Nicola donned a bright pink tulle gown featuring a floating train, and a baby pink lace strapless number. \n\nNicola Peltz smouldered as she fronted a new campaign for designer Genny - after it was reported she is getting a $1million a month allowance from her father Nelson\n\nBrushing off the drama, Nicola is again the face of Italian designer Genny for its Spring/Summer 2026 campaign\nNicola continues to be the face of Genny because the designer says she 'embodies its most authentic and special spirit: an empathetic, contemporary femininity capable of stirring emotion without artifice'.\nIt comes after it was reported Nicola receives a $1million a month allowance from her billionaire father Nelson.\nThe staggering allowance is in stark contrast to the financial support Nicola's husband Brooklyn Beckham is thought to receive from his parents David and Victoria.\nWhile his name may not be as well known in pop culture as the Beckhams, Nelson Peltz's wealth eclipses that of his co-parents-in-law, with the businessman boasting a stunning net worth of $1.6billion, in comparison to the Beckhams' $680million.\nMarina Hyde speaking on The Rest Is Entertainment podcast says 'from what I hear I think the Beckhams give Brooklyn a lot of money but not insane money and they have this dream to some degree that he will stand on his own two feet and become independent.'\n'Maybe Nelson Peltz would deny this but I hear that he said to them that \"I give my daughter a million dollar a month allowance\".\n'The one thing they [the Beckhams] didn't think their children would be doing would be the ones signing the prenuptial, they thought it would be the other way round.'\nReports last year claimed that David and Victoria fear their son is 'trapped' by the couple's purported pre-nup as well as his living situation in LA.\n\nIn snaps for the campaign, Nicola looked stony faced as she posed in an array of glamorous ensembles\n\nElsewhere Nicola donned a bright pink tulle gown featuring a floating train, and a baby pink lace strapless number\n\nNicola continues to be the face of Genny because the designer says she 'embodies its most authentic and special spirit\nThe Beckhams' eldest son has been living at a £11million Hollywood mansion with his wife Nicola for over a year but it has been reported that she is the primary owner of the home. \nA source told The Sun in June 2025 that the Peltz family feels the Beckhams have not been providing amply for their son, saying: 'Money, so the saying goes, is the root of all evil. Certainly, in the case of the Beckhams vs Peltzes, it's proven... tricksy. \n'David and Victoria are two working-class kids done good. When it came to buying this house, of course they weren't just going to hand their son millions of pounds - what sort of message does that send?'\nWhen it came to the joining of the two families, Nelson wasted no time splashing $3.5million on his daughter's wedding in 2022, showing he'd truly welcomed Brooklyn, 26, into the family fold. \nNelson's journey to billions started when he and his brother Robert took over their father's frozen-food distribution company which they grew rapidly over the coming years.\n\nIt comes after it was reported Nicola receives a $1million a month allowance from her billionaire father Nelson (Nicola and Brooklyn pictured with her father Nelson Peltz)\n\nThe staggering allowance is in stark contrast to the financial support Nicola's husband Brooklyn Beckham is thought to receive from his parents David and Victoria (seen with parents in 2019)\nHe grew his wealth further in the 1980s by acquiring manufacturing firm Triangle Industries and building it into the largest packaging company in the world before selling it in 1988, a deal which reportedly netted him hundreds of millions. \nWhile Nelson could have easily retired with his already astronomical wealth, he instead pivoted to 'activist investing': buying significant stakes in underperforming companies and pushing for changes such as cost cuts, restructurings, asset sales, or management shake-ups. \nNelson went on to build a family dynasty as the father of 10 children. He had two children with his first wife Cynthia Abrams who he married in 1964 and divorced in 1981.\nThe businessman went on to marry former model Claudia Heffner in 1985 and had eight children with her - Matthew, 40, a businessman, Brad, 32, a former ice hockey player; Brittany, who is a children's clothes designer; Darren (known as Diesel), 27, a tech entrepreneur; twins Zachary and Gregory, 18 - and Nicola. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNicola Peltz smoulders as she fronts campaign for designer Genny after it was revealed she 'gets a $1MILLION a month allowance from her father Nelson'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 78\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

But for more than five years, he’s been trying to convince Americans the opposite is true by falsely saying the election was marred by widespread fraud.\n\nNow that he’s president again, Trump is pushing the federal government to back up those bogus claims.\n\nOn Wednesday, the FBI served a search warrant at the election headquarters of Fulton County, Georgia, which includes most of Atlanta, seeking ballots from the 2020 election. That follows Trump’s comments earlier this month when he suggested during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that charges related to the election were imminent.\n\n“The man has obsessions, as do a fair number of people, but he’s the only one who has the full power of the United States behind him,” said Rick Hasen, a UCLA law professor.\n\nHasen and many others noted that Trump’s use of the FBI to pursue his obsession with the 2020 election is part of a pattern of the president transforming the federal government into his personal tool of vengeance.\n\nSen. Jon Ossoff, a Georgia Democrat, compared the search to the Minnesota immigration crackdown that has killed two U.S. citizen protesters, launched by Trump as his latest blow against the state’s governor, who ran against him as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate in 2024.\n\n“From Minnesota to Georgia, on display to the whole world, is a President spiraling out of control, wielding federal law enforcement as an unaccountable instrument of personal power and revenge,” Ossoff said in a statement.\n\nIt also comes as election officials across the country are starting to rev up for the 2026 midterms, where Trump is struggling to help his party maintain its control of Congress. Noting that, in 2020, Trump contemplated using the military to seize voting machines after his loss, some worry he’s laying the groundwork for a similar maneuver in the fall.\n\n“Georgia’s a blueprint,” said Kristin Nabers of the left-leaning group All Voting Is Local. “If they can get away with taking election materials here, what’s to stop them from taking election materials or machines from some other state after they lose?”\n\nGeorgia has been at the heart of Trump’s 2020 obsession. He infamously called Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Jan. 2, 2021, asking that Raffensperger “find” 11,780 more votes for Trump so he could be declared the winner of the state. Raffensperger refused, noting that repeated reviews confirmed Democrat Joe Biden had narrowly won Georgia.\n\nThose were part of a series of reviews in battleground states, often led by Republicans, that affirmed Biden’s win, including in Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada. Trump also lost dozens of court cases challenging the election results and his own attorney general at the time said there was no evidence of widespread fraud.\n\nHis allies who repeated his lies have been successfully sued for defamation. That includes former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who settled with two Georgia election workers after a court ruled he owed them $148 million for defaming them after the 2020 election.\n\nVoting machine companies also have brought defamation cases against some conservative-leaning news sites that aired unsubstantiated claims about their equipment being linked to fraud in 2020. Fox News settled one such case by agreeing to pay $787 million after the judge ruled it was “CRYSTAL clear” that none of the allegations were true.\n\nTrump’s campaign to move Georgia into his column also sparked an ill-fated attempt to prosecute him and some of his allies by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, a Democrat. The case collapsed after Willis was removed over conflict-of-interest concerns, and Trump has since sought damages from the office.\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump rewarded some of those who helped him try to overturn the 2020 election results by pardoning, commuting or vowing to dismiss the cases of about 1,500 people charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. He later signed an executive order trying to set new rules for state election systems and voting procedures, although that has been repeatedly blocked by judges who have ruled that the Constitution gives states, and in some instances Congress, control of elections rather than the president.\n\nAs part of his campaign of retribution, Trump also has spoken about wanting to criminally charge lawmakers who sat on the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack, suggesting protective pardons of them from Biden are legally invalid.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy NICK CRAVEN, SENIOR REPORTER \n Published:17:19 GMT, 29 January 2026 |Updated:17:31 GMT, 29 January 2026 \n\nThey are rapidly becoming not only the best connected but the most influential online restaurant commentators in the country.\nBut the enormous social media success of posh foodie pair Topjaw - aka old friends Jesse Burgess and Will Warr - does not mean they are universally popular.\nAnd now, for the first time, a successful - and proudly working class - London chef has decided to go public with his stinging criticism of the influencers.\nEd McIlroy told the Daily Mail: 'It's funny that Topjaw are being hailed as the voice of the industry. Because to me they're the opposite.\n'Jesse Burgess in particular probably grew up snapping his fingers at waiters - and now he's supposed to be the voice of restaurants in the UK?'\nMr McIlroy's outspoken comments today are the culmination of a feud between him and the social media broadcasters that has been bubbling like a simmering stock for many months.\nBut first the question of Topjaw's social background, connections and meteoric rise - which informs that accusation of 'finger snapping.'\nBurgess and Warr are both well-connected former public schoolboys on the periphery of the Made In Chelsea scene, with the latter sufficiently friendly with Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, to be entrusted to be her in-house filmmaker.\n\nOld friends Jesse Burgess and Will Warr have grown an army of fans as restaurant influencers and are extremely well connected\n\nWorking class chef Ed McIlroy claims the pair probably grew up snapping their fingers at waiters\n\nEd's dislike of Topjaw stems from when, as unknowns, the pair attempted to film inside his pub The Plimsoll near Arsenal's Emirates Stadium and were told by the chef that he was too busy\nThey also have celebrities queueing up to appear in their short films, with recent cameos from the likes of Sir Idris Elba, Ncuti Gatwa, Stanley Tucci, Kate Winslet, Florence Pugh, Walton Goggins, Andrew Garfield, Steve Coogan, Ed Sheeran and Charli XCX.\nThey have also made similar inroads with more established media food commentators like Jamie Oliver, Gordon Ramsay, Michel Roux Jr, and Masterchef star Grace Dent all appearing on Topjaw.\nIndeed, the duo count connections at the very top of British society.\nFilm-making wizard Warr, who mostly stays behind the cameras, has already cemented his reputation with a series of intimate videos made with Prince William, Kate and their family\nThe fourth and most recent film, released earlier this month to mark the Princess’s 44th birthday, was filmed in Berkshire, Cumbria, Gloucestershire, East Sussex and the Cotswolds.\nHe had previously worked on footage of the Coronation and the couple’s 10 year wedding anniversary in 2021, and was recommended to the Waleses via a friend, Matt Porteous, the photographer who has shot the Royal couple’s Christmas card photos.\nAll of this has grown Topjaw a huge audience: 940k followers on Instagram, 235k on TikTok and 442k on YouTube.\nAnd Topjaw frontman Burgess, a former model, is now being groomed for mainstream international media fame with a Gordon Ramsay-produced Apple TV show 'Knife Edge: Chasing Michelin Stars.'\nThe pair describe themselves as simply 'two best buds travelling the world documenting the best things to eat, drink and do' - and are at pains to downplay the influence they may have, with Burgess recently saying: 'I'm not a critic, and really I'm not there to criticise.'\nBut leading London chef Ed McIlroy insists that criticism is exactly what the pair have been dishing out to him - unfairly he believes - and he even claims they have censored any positive mentions of him on their broadcasts.\nMcIlroy came to food world attention when he relaunched an old pub near Arsenal's Emirates stadium as The Plimsoll to great acclaim - Grace Dent called it 'brilliant' - while their signature burger became renowned as the best in London.\nAnd it was The Plimsoll burger that saw McIlroy and Burgess first fall out, he claims.\nBurgess, on this occasion writing for food magazine The Pass, described McIlroy's establishment as 'a strong contender for London's most inhospitable pub'.\nMcllroy claims Burgess's nose had been put out of joint twice because he was refused permission to film in the kitchen and then turned up to review The Plimsoll on an Arsenal match day when the pub is rammed with drinkers and so doesn't serve food.\nMcIlroy told the Daily Mail: 'He hasn't received hospitality when he's come to the pub, because the first time he came before he was famous, he demanded to film something during a Friday whilst I was very busy in the kitchen, and I asked him to leave because I had no idea who he was.\n'Then another time he comes back for a burger on a match day, and he was just told that we don't do food on those days. And I think that was enough to irk him to then start trying to publicly slander us.'\nThe burgeoning feud was stoked further when McIlroy opened a second establishment nearby in Finsbury Park, the Spanish-influenced fish restaurant Tollington's.\nWhile once again most reviews were favourable - Grace Dent again describing 'hands down the greatest chips I've ever eaten' - Topjaw disagreed.\nOn their Instagram account there is a link to a section called 'Jesse's Journal' in which Burgess gives straight-to-camera reviews. And on his visit to Tollington's, where he ordered a monkfish dish, he said frankly: 'I couldn't eat it, it was rubbish'.\nMcIlroy's jokey response to this slight last summer saw him post a viral video of a car smashing into a restaurant on Instagram saying 'I'm going to drive a Prius into Topjaw'.\nAnd he even challenged Burgess to a fight - or at least an organised boxing match for charity.\nNow, furious McIlroy has gone one step further and gone on record about his dislike of the pair - who he says 'have crossed the line'.\nThe angry chef told us: 'I don't expect everyone that walks through the door of the restaurants I open to love it, and nor would I ever want that.\n'What annoys me is the bias that I discovered. The problem is with this industry, everyone does know everyone, which maybe he [Burgess] doesn't understand because he's not actually a part of it.'\nHe even claims favourable mentions of his work have been cut: 'Friends have told me that many people have suggested my restaurants on Topjaw's quick-fire interviews but they were just edited out continuously.'\nWhile McIlroy admits their feud can appear slightly performative - he keeps insisting he enjoys the 'banter' with Topjaw - he does insist the antipathy is very much real.\n'There's a little ongoing sort of feud between us,' he said. 'But I don't think about Topjaw that much until someone asks me about them...\n'There was a point where we almost reconciled. I was about to just say 'stop being silly and come and have some dinner.'\nBut they have yet to make peace.\nAs Topjaw's influence has grown the pair have made other less public enemies than McIlroy - the pair have even reportedly been sent death threats - as many resent them for 'ruining' little known restaurants by directing huge crowds to them.\n\nBurgess and Warr are both well-connected former public schoolboys on the periphery of the Made In Chelsea scene\n\nBurgess is often seen at the wheel of his Bentley on social media \n\nWarr (right) is now a family man with three children and lives with wife Sarah in a leafy suburb of London \n\nJesse married his long-term girlfriend Taura Lamb last year in a multi-day ceremony attended by the pair's celebrity friends \nMcIlroy insisted: 'I really hope they're not getting death threats, but maybe it's just people on the internet and it shouldn't be taken as seriously because of that.'\nBut it is taken very seriously and McIlroy believes the medium being used - and the short attention spans it encourages - is part of the problem.\n'I think the online food influencers are just reflective of a societal problem right now,' he said.\n'It's for people that have the attention span of some kind of small amphibian, and they're going to find that kind of content exactly what they want.\n'Why would they want to go and read a traditional restaurant review when they can have someone that looks and sounds good and is able to present in a manner that delivers quick-fire information.\n'So they just take those suggestions and put them onto their Google Maps and then go to these restaurants.'\nBut he insists they can still bury the hatchet: 'If I sat in the pub and had a pint with the Topjaw guys, it wouldn't be awkward.'\nAnother overt critic of the Topjaw oeuvre is Will Hosie, lifestyle editor of Country Life.\nHe recently decried 'amateur opinions taken as gospel by those who no longer recognise the difference between someone with an iPhone and an expert.'\nHe explained: 'What Topjaw produces is not a critique: it is the video equivalent of what we call an advertorial.\n'It is impossible for a critic to ever be entirely objective, but Topjaw are all subjective.\n'Mmmm', 'woooow', 'phwoaaaar' - Jesse gushes to the camera whenever he shoves something into his mouth.'\nIf Toby Inskip, the man behind Eating with Tod, and his disastrous recent 'Festive Feast' event might be viewed as the Lidl of food vloggers, then Topjaw would surely rank at the Fortnum and Mason.\nBut they insist they are not just about expensive restaurants and have even told some of their celebrity guests that their tips are 'too posh'.\nThis is despite the fact that some have claimed they are too posh themselves.\nWarr, the son of farmers near Banbury, Oxfordshire, went to independent co-ed boarding Bloxham School, where fees these days top £50,000 a year, and studied product development at Loughborough University, working on the side as a freelance film-maker throughout his degree.\nBurgess, meanwhile, grew up in Cambridgeshire and went to £43,000 a year Kimbolton School in Cambridgeshire with his mother a cabin crew member on private jets.\nOriginally he had his heart set on an acting career but at 17 he was spotted by a modelling scout on the King's Road in Chelsea and signed up to Storm, the agency famously behind Kate Moss.\nAfter several successful catwalk years, he began working with fellow ex-Storm model and Made in Chelsea star Jamie Laing star on his gourmet sweet-making start-up called Candy Kittens.\nAnd that is where Burgess met Will Warr, quickly becoming best friends as they travelled around the country making promo videos for Laing.\n'It was like a university tour,' Burgess told The Times. 'Will and I were going to Liverpool together, making a video, and we thought, 'This is really fun and we're quite good at this.'\nFlushed with the success of Topjaw, Jesse and Will are now both millionaires in their own right.\nProducer Will is estimated to be worth £2million while Jesse has amassed £2.25million, bolstered by going 'solo' with his Apple TV venture.\n\nSir Idris Elba is one of the many A-listers interviewed by Burgess and Warr on Topjaw \n\nActress Florence Pugh was quizzed on her food opinions in one of Topjaw's trademark rapid-fire segments \n\nKate Winslet is another megastar who has offered up her culinary thoughts to the Topjaw pair \n\nBurgess and Warr have interviewed singer Ed Sheeran\nTopjaw itself is valued at just over £450,000 and employs four people, while both Jesse and Will both have made significant property investments.\nWill and his wife Sarah, 34, live with their three children in a house worth £1million in a leafy south London street, while Jesse and his would-be pop star wife Taura Lamb, 27, have a flat worth £1.5million in the A-list enclave of Swiss Cottage in London.\nBurgess and Lamb had their wedding featured in British Vogue last year - a multi-day affair which first had a ceremony in the Fitzrovia Chapel in Westminster. \nThis was followed by a quiet celebration at nearby pub The George. 'Rather than a sit-down meal, we opted for groaning platters of black pudding scotch eggs, fried chicken, celeriac skewers, iberico pork ribs and oysters,' Jesse told Vogue.\n\nEXCLUSIVE 'He's always been a free spirit': Truth about Beard Meats Food and his 'unconventional' lifestyle \nTwo days later the pair had an all-day knees-up at Old Sessions House in uber-cool east London and Jesse used all his contacts within the food world to wow his guests. \nThe affair began early with a wedding breakfast put on with the help of 'food coordinator' Helena Lewis.\nAnd culminated in mains designed to share - 'a white peach salad and slow cooked lamb shoulder, smoked Merguez ragu with fennel, crispy potato grilled Sicilian peppers and summer courgettes on whipped goats curd'.\nLamb peppers her social media with glamorous photographs of herself on holiday, but the majority of her recent pics are of her and Jesse looking loved-up, presumably while he films his latest Topjaw installament.\nMeanwhile back in his leafy suburb, Will lives a far more domesticated life with wife Sarah and their young children. \nTheir social media is filled with idyllic scenes of playtime and outings familiar to most young middle class families in Britain.\nThey moved into their new home in January of last year and Will credits wife Sarah - who he owns a service business with - for the interior design of their 'forever home'.\n\nWill Warr and his wife Sarah live in a leafy suburb of south London\nTopjaw really took off from 2019, when they made a film called '48 Hours in Paris' featuring cafes and restaurants on the recommendations of local Parisians - and it went viral.\nFilms in other cities such as Bangkok, Dubai, Los Angeles and Amsterdam soon followed, and as the interest grew, so did the advertising revenues.\nOnce established, the pair began searching for celebrities to give their videos added reach.\nTopjaw was approached for comment.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe food influencer class war: How Britain's poshest restaurant critics Topjaw are locked in a bitter fallout with burger chef who tells Mail about entitled behaviour - and why they 'crossed the line'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy JESSICA JANES, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:17:18 GMT, 29 January 2026 |Updated:17:23 GMT, 29 January 2026 \n\nSue Radford has confirmed that her eldest daughter, Sophie, has split from her husband, Joe Bradley, following 10 years of marriage. \nThe TV personality, 50, who shares 22 children with her husband Noel Radford, 55, shared that although the couple have decided to split, they are 'making things work with their three children'. \nSpeaking to The Mirror ahead of a new series of her family TV show 22 Kids & Counting, she confirmed: 'Sadly, a lot of marriages do break down, and you can’t fix them. \n'They (Sophie and Joe) aren’t together anymore, but they are making it work with their three children.' \nSue and her husband Noel are well known as Britain's biggest family as they share children including Chris, 36, Sophie, 32, Chloe, 30, Jack, 28, Daniel, 26, Luke, 25, Millie, 24, Katie, 23, James, 22, Ellie, 20, Aimee, 19, Josh, 18, Max, 17, Tillie, 15, Oscar, 14, Casper, 13, Hallie, 10, Phoebe, nine, Archie, eight, Bonnie, seven, and Heidie, five. \nElsewhere in the interview, Sue revealed that Sunday's episode of the show will focus on Sophie's split from her husband. \n\nSue Radford has confirmed that her eldest daughter, Sophie, has split from her husband, Joe Bradley, following 10 years of marriage (Sue and husband Noel pictured 2024)\n\nThe TV personality, 50, who shares 22 children with her husband Noel Radford, 55, shared that although the couple have decided to split, they are 'making things work with their three children' (Sophie and Joe pictured)\nShe said: 'We are really proud of Sophie for sharing this on camera. She wanted to share how she was feeling and how she is feeling now.'\nThe episode will mark the first time that Sophie and her parents have publicly confirmed their relationship is over. \nElsewhere in the interview, the mother-of-22 also shared that she and her husband Noel realised the split had been 'brewing for a while'. \nShe said: 'We realised it had been brewing for a while. Sophie couldn’t live like that anymore. She is definitely a lot happier now.' \nMeanwhile, Noel added that he and his wife have known Joe for a long time, but they want him to be happy, too. \nWhen asked if they would like their daughter Sophie to meet someone new, Sue said that Sophie is in 'no rush' and is getting herself into a routine now that she is a single mother. \nHowever, they would like to see her with someone new when she is ready for a new relationship. \nIt follows the news that the Radfords have enjoyed extremely lucrative business endeavours in recent times, managing to triple their wealth thanks to their various enterprises. \n\nSpeaking to The Mirror ahead of a new series of her family TV show 22 Kids & Counting, she confirmed: 'Sadly, a lot of marriages do break down, and you can’t fix them,' (pictured with husband Noel)\n\nShe continued: 'They (Sophie and Joe seen with their children) aren’t together anymore, but they are making it work with their three children' \n\n Mother of Britain's biggest family Sue Radford, 50, unveils dramatic weight loss transformation as fans say she looks like her teenage daughter \nSue and Noel tripled their cash, and as of February 2025, they have a net worth of £975,000, according to The Sun.\nFeeding and caring for their brood isn't cheap - so the parenting duo devised multiple avenues of income over the years.\nThe Lancashire-based family have made their riches from filming six seasons of their Channel 5 show, 22 Kids And Counting, book deals and their own online pie business.\nFans of the family have previously accused the family of living lavishly, with the Radfords forking out £7,000 at Christmas alone - though both parents have insisted they are 'not wealthy'.\nHowever, documents from Companies House reveal the family likely have a blossoming bank balance since since tripling their wealth over the 2024 financial year.\nSue and Noel became active directors of their company, TRF21 Limited, in 2019, which was described as providing 'media representation services'.\nIn the 2024 financial year, the company pocketed a generous wedge of cash, with the company's net worth rising 493 per cent in 2024.\nThe rise means the pair ended the year with £124,647 in capital and reserves, as well as £78,695 set aside for future liabilities, as reported by The Sun.\n\nSue and Noel are parents to 22 children (seen in 2018) - Chris, 36, Sophie, 31, Chloe, 29, Jack, 28, Daniel, 26, Luke, 24, Millie, 23, Katie, 22, James, 21, Ellie, 20, Aimee, 19, Josh, 18, Max, 16, Tillie, 15, Oscar, 13, Casper, 12, Hallie, 10, Phoebe, eight, Archie, seven, Bonnie, six and Heidie, five. Sadly, the couple's 17th child, Alfie, was stillborn on July 6 2014\n\nThe reason for the family's growing wealth is likely down to a handful of factors, with Sue and Noel holding numerous streams of income.\nThe couple own a pastry shop called Radford's Pie Company, near their home in Morecambe, which has seen impressive growth in recent times.\nIn the 2024 financial year, the company saw a 177 per cent increase in value from £78,837 in capital and reserves - up from £28,470 in 2023.\nElsewhere, the family have relied on income from their various other ventures, including social media partnerships and brand deals.\nWhile Sue previously lamented being called an 'influencer', there's no denying that the family's social media platforms have become an integral part of their income.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSue Radford reveals her daughter Sophie has SPLIT from husband Joe Bradley after 10 years of marriage as she says: 'They aren't together anymore, but they are making it work with their three children'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy LAURA FOX, ASSOCIATE SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:15:55 GMT, 29 January 2026 |Updated:17:29 GMT, 29 January 2026 \n\nRebecca Loos has laid into Victoria Beckham in a new documentary about the family's explosive feud, claiming that their son Brooklyn's statement is 'validation for what she said 22 years ago.'\nDavid's former PA, 48, previously claimed to have had an affair with the married footballer in 2004, which he has repeatedly denied.\nIn a clip from the documentary, The Beckham Feud: Truth and Lies, Rebecca claimed she found herself at the centre of a 'PR war' after her accusations, which echoes the sentiments of Brooklyn's statement, where he claimed much of his life was full of 'performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships.'\nBrooklyn severed all ties with his family in a bombshell six-page statement last week, where he revealed he has no wishes to reconcile with them, and called his parents 'controlling and manipulative'.\nIn the 90-minute special, which airs on Sunday, Rebecca also weighs in on Brooklyn's claims that Victoria danced 'inappropriately' with him at his 2022 wedding to Nicola Peltz, saying 'any other mother would have read the room' and declined to dance in the situation. \nThe star, who now lives in Norway with her husband, had previously vowed on social media that 'the truth always comes out' after Brooklyn released his statement, again mirroring his words where he wrote: 'I believe the truth always comes out.'\n\nRebecca Loos has laid into Victoria Beckham in a new documentary about the family's feud, claiming that their son Brooklyn's explosive statement is 'validation' for her own claims\n\nIn a clip from the upcoming programme, Rebecca reflected on Brooklyn's words by comparing it to her own 2004 interview where she claimed David had been unfaithful\nShe said: 'Suddenly you're part of a big PR war. In a very small way, this is of course validation for what I said and came forward and said 22 years ago. \n'Brooklyn is basically confirming inauthentic relationships, value of promotion, endorsements above all else, and that it's all focused on brand Beckham, and that that's all that matters.'\nRebecca also reflected on Brooklyn's claims that Victoria 'hijacked' his first dance with Nicola at his wedding in 2022, after Marc Anthony branded the designer 'the most beautiful woman in the room.'\nShe says: 'Whether it came from her or whether it was Marc Anthony is beside the point because it shows a lack of awareness for other people's feelings. \n'I think any other mother would've read the room and understood this is awkward and probably said, thank you for the compliment, but the most beautiful woman in the room is Nicola, Nicola, please take this dance. \n'Or at least if the mother had had a few too many glasses of wine and was unable to read the room, maybe the husband or the father would then have maybe stepped in and maybe grabbed Nicola, twirled her around and then swap partners to let her have the dance.'\nAt the centre of Brooklyn's statement was the allegation that his mum Victoria had 'hijacked' his first dance with Nicola at their 2022 wedding when Marc 'called me to the stage' \nHe went on to claim that his mum 'danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone. I've never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in my entire life.\nMere hours after Brooklyn shared his explosive statement last week, Rebecca weighed into the feud on social media.\n\nLast week, Brooklyn severed all ties with his family in a bombshell statement six-page statement, where he revealed he has no wishes to reconcile with them\n\nRebecca also reflected on Brooklyn's claims that Victoria 'hijacked' his first dance with Nicola at his wedding in 2022\n\nEXCLUSIVE Business as usual! David Beckham announces huge new 20-year deal after Brooklyn's statement \nReplying to one fan who suggested she may 'feel a source of extra validation' at reading Brooklyn's words, Rebecca wrote: 'So happy he is standing up for himself and speaking publicly finally!!!! I have felt so bad for his poor wife, knowing too well what they can be like!'\nShe added in another comment 'the truth always comes out ❤️', mirroring Brooklyn's own words in his explosive statement in which he wrote: 'I believe the truth always comes out.'\nDavid has always denied the affair allegations, and famously talked about the reports in his Netflix show, released in October 2023. Rebecca insisted the show was David 'trying to portray an image of perfection that was nothing like reality'.\nRebecca's show of support for David and Victoria's eldest son came hours after he took to Instagram to share a six-page statement, where he said he has no wishes to reconcile with his family and is standing up for himself 'for the first time in my life'.\nBrooklyn and his wife Nicola are at the heart of the acrimonious divide that has resulted in them snubbing all significant family celebrations over recent months, including his father David's milestone 50th birthday and knighthood.\nHe said fractures within the family began during their wedding in April 2022 as he claimed his mother Victoria and dad David 'endlessly tried' to ruin their relationship.\nIn his statement Brooklyn went as far as to say he has been 'controlled by a family that values public promotion above all else' and that since being with Nicola, he has found 'peace and relief' after battling crippling anxiety.\n\nBrooklyn and his wife Nicola are at the heart of the acrimonious divide that has resulted in them snubbing all significant family celebrations over recent months\nBrooklyn also claimed Victoria, who has her own fashion brand, cancelled making Nicola's wedding dress at the 'eleventh hour' and hijacked their first dance which left him so 'embarrassed' they decided to renew their vows without his family last year.\nAfter Brooklyn broke the internet with his allegations - including a bizarre claim that Victoria 'danced inappropriately on him' at his wedding - Posh Spice fans rallied to get the star her first ever solo spot on the charts. \nIn the wake of a huge campaign among her fans, last week Victoria bagged her first ever solo number one - with her 2001 single Not Such An Innocent Girl reaching number one on the iTunes chart in the UK and Ireland. \nWhile the rest of the Beckhams gathered in Paris this week to support Victoria, as she received a Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters, Brooklyn made it clear where his loyalties lie.\nBrooklyn shared a video montage of highlights from his trip to Malibu within hours of his family putting on a united front at their first public event since he launched his blistering attack.\nThe Beckham Feud: Truth and Lies airs on Sunday 1st February at 9pm on 5.\n\nBrooklyn Beckham's statement in full\n\nI have been silent for years and made every effort to keep these matters private. Unfortunately, my parents and their team have continued to go to the press, leaving me with no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth about only some of the lies that have been printed.\nI do not want to reconcile with my family. I'm not being controlled, I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life. For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family. The performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships have been a fixture of the life I was born into.\nRecently, I have seen with my own eyes the lengths that they'll go through to place countless lies in the media, mostly at the expense of innocent people, to preserve their own facade. But I believe the truth always comes out.\nMy parents have been trying endlessly to ruin my relationship since before my wedding, and it hasn't stopped. My mum cancelled making Nicola's dress in the eleventh hour despite how excited she was to wear her design, forcing her to urgently find a new dress. \nWeeks before our big day, my parents repeatedly pressured and attempted to bribe me into signing away the rights to my name, which would have affected me, my wife, and our future children.\nThey were adamant on me signing before my wedding date because then the terms of the deal would be initiated. My holdout affected the payday, and they have never treated me the same since. \nDuring the wedding planning, my mum went so far as to call me \"evil\" because Nicola and I chose to include my Nanny Sandra, and Nicola's Naunni at our table, because they both didn't have their husbands. Both of our parents had their own tables equally adjacent to ours.\nThe night before our wedding, members of my family told me that Nicola was \"not blood\" and \"not family.\" Since the moment I started standing up for myself with my family, I've received endless attacks from my parents, both privately and publicly, that were sent to the press on their orders.\nEven my brothers were sent to attack me on social media, before they ultimately blocked me out of nowhere this last Summer. \nMy mum hijacked my first dance with my wife, which had been planned weeks in advance to a romantic love song. In front of our 500 wedding guests, Marc Anthony called me to the stage, where in the schedule was planned to be my romantic dance with my wife but instead my mum was waiting to dance with me instead. \nShe danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone. I've never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in my entire life. We wanted to renew our vows so we could create new memories of our wedding day that bring us joy and happiness, not anxiety and embarrassment.\nMy wife has been consistently disrespected by my family, no matter how hard we've tried to come together as one. My mum has repeatedly invited women from my past into our lives in ways that were clearly intended to make us both uncomfortable.\nDespite this, we still travelled to London for my dad's birthday and were rejected for a week as we waited in our hotel room trying to plan quality time with him. He refused all of our attempts, unless it was at his big birthday party with a hundred guests and cameras at every corner.\nWhen he finally agreed to see me, it was under the condition that Nicola wasn't invited. It was a slap in the face. Later, when my family travelled to LA, they refused to see me at all.\nMy family values public promotion and endorsements above all else. Brand Beckham comes first. Family \"love\" is decided by how much you post on social media, or how quickly you drop everything to show up and pose for a family photo opp, even if it's at the expense of our professional obligations.\nWe've gone out of our way for years to show up and support at every fashion show, every party, and every press activity to show 'our perfect family.' But the one time my wife asked for my mum's support to save displaced dogs during the LA fires, my mum refused.\nThe narrative that my wife controls me is completely backwards. I have been controlled by my parents for most of my life. I grew up with overwhelming anxiety. For the first time in my life, since stepping away from my family, that anxiety has disappeared.\nI wake up every morning grateful for the life I chose, and have found peace and relief. My wife and I do not want a life shaped by image, press, or manipulation. All we want peace, privacy and happiness for us and our future family. \nRebecca LoosVictoria Beckham\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRebecca Loos lays into Victoria Beckham as she says 'any other mother would have read the room' and brands Brooklyn's scathing statement 'validation for what I said 22 years ago'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 466\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

JB Pritzker could potentially be his party's best choice to lead Democrats to victory in the 2028 presidential election. And Carville, who first gained national attention over three decades ago as the chief strategist for former President Bill Clinton's 1992 White House victory, argues that former Vice President Kamala Harris doesn't have a shot at winning the next Democratic presidential nomination. The 2028 Democratic nomination battle in the race to succeed term-limited President Donald Trump is expected to draw a crowded and competitive field. \"If I had to say one guy... I'd take JD Pritzker,\" Carville said this week in a sit-down interview with Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo on his 'Arroyo Grande' podcast. Carville was asked which Democrat he could see carrying the flag into 2028. WE'RE JUST A MONTH INTO 2026, BUT THE 2028 WHITE HOUSE RACE IS WELL UNDER WAY The billionaire governor, a member of the Pritzker family that owns the Hyatt hotel chain and who has started several of his own venture capital and investment startups, is running this year for a third term to steer Illinois. And Pritzker, who has become a leading voice in the Democrats' opposition to Trump and has taken steps to Trump-proof his solidly blue state, has made a handful of trips in recent years to the key early voting states in the race for the White House. Carville noted that Pritzker \"campaigns hard.\" DEMOCRATIC HEAVYWEIGHTS TURN HEADS, SPARK 2028 SPECULATION Asked about whether he could see Harris as the party's standard-bearer in 2028, Carville responded, \"She has no chance.\" Harris replaced then-President Joe Biden as the Democrats' 2024 presidential nominee after Biden dropped his bid in July of that year, a month after a disastrous debate performance against Trump. Harris ended up losing the general election to Trump, who narrowly swept all seven key battleground states. \"No Democrat wants anything to do with anybody that had anything to do with 2024,\" Carville emphasized, as he reasoned why Harris couldn't win the 2028 nomination. He also questioned whether Harris, the nation's first female and first Black vice president, had the ability to energize the Black community if she launched another White House run. Carville said that the Democrats' mantra heading into 2028 is \"just win,\" and argued that \"if we nominate two white males, nobody’s going to give a s---.\" VANCE AMPLIFIES HIS 2026 MESSAGE WHILE LANDING KEY 2028 BACKING He also doubted whether Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York would be a good 2028 nominee for the party. Carville said the progressive champion and rising Democratic Party star \"has talent, and she’s very smart.\" But he said that \"the reason she is not going to work\" is because \"there’s a large part of the Democratic Party that like to feel smug.\" Carville argued that Ocasio-Cortez and others on the progressive left of the party have alienated male voters. \"Democratic culture became very feminized and very judgmental and that’s why we pushed so many of the males away,\" Carville said. Asked by Fox News Digital if there's anyone else he thinks is worth watching as a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, Carville mentioned former Louisiana Lt. Gov. and former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu. Landrieu mulled but ultimately decided against a 2020 White House and later served in the Biden administration.

Majority of Republicans support Trump getting the US military involved in more countries","text":"The majority of Trump voters now back greater military intervention in other countries, according to a new poll, despite the president’s previous pledge to take the U.S. out of foreign wars.\n\nHis supporters gave greatest backing to an attack on Iran, with 51 percent approving of military strikes on the Middle Eastern nation, Politico’s survey found. That number was even higher those who described themselves specifically as MAGA Republicans, at 61 percent.\n\nTrump is still mulling strikes in Iran after weeks of protests left thousands of people in the country dead. Earlier this week the president warned the regime an American armada was headed to the Middle East, while claiming “time was running out” for Tehran to make a deal. \n\nDemocrats, by comparison, were broadly against any such intervention in Iran, with only 18 percent of people who cast their ballots for Kamala Harris in 2024 backing the move. \n\nTrump has adopted an increasingly aggressive foreign policy since he returned to office last year. This month alone, the administration has forced regime change in Venezuela while also demanding Greenland becomes a U.S. territory. \n\nDespite his voters’ increasing enthusiasm for international intervention, Trump was elected on a promise of removing the U.S. from costly overseas wars and prioritizing “America First”. \n\nHowever, the actual definition of Trump’s infamous mantra has become flexible for his supporters, Amy Walter, editor-in-chief of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, told Politico. \n\n“If you believe the Trump theory that our goal is to do everything we can to protect Americans, and that includes taking out bad people in certain places, then that’s America First,” she said. \n\nHowever, she told Politico that there is an important caveat to support for Trump’s newfound interventionism. \n\nWhile military action is broadly supported by his base, long-term involvement or more direct efforts that put U.S. soldiers at risk are not. \n\n“If he said tomorrow that we’re going to send troops into the Middle East or we’re going to put boots on the ground in Venezuela, that is one thing that would break the coalition apart,” she said. \n\nRepublicans have urged caution over Iran for this very reason. \n\n\"It really needs to come organically from the people of Iran,” Representative Nicole Malliotakis told Fox News. “At some point, they’ve got to take ownership and leadership. \n\n“Boots on the ground, you know, foreign intervention and costly overseas wars have been borne out to be pretty ineffective in the long run.”\n\nSupport amongst Trump voters for international military intervention also splits depending on which countries are the potential targets.\n\nMost Trump voters were against intervening in Greenland, for example, despite the president’s previous threats. \n\nJust 21 percent of his 2024 voters backed taking over the Danish territory, with that number only rising to 26 percent amongst MAGA Republicans. \n\nSending the military into Mexico was marginally more popular, with 39 percent of MAGA approving of intervening south of the border and 22 percent of non-MAGA supporters agreeing.\n\nAround 30 percent of his voters also supported sending the military to Colombia, with 28 percent advocating for intervention in Cuba. \n\nAll three countries have drawn Trump’s ire in recent months, with the president calling for cartels in Mexico to be bombed and for reportedly plotting to overthrow the current regime in Cuba. He has also openly bragged about the possibility of usurping Gustavo Petro, the president of Colombia. \n\nAttacking China was lower on the priority list for Trump voters with only 25 percent backing the move, although that does mean 1 in 4 of his voters support an attack that could spark a major global conflict.","summary":"The poll found that most Trump voters backed attacking Iran, but splits emerged over strikes on Greenland","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-iran-greenland-military-intervention-poll-b2910293.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/19/14/03/GettyImages-2251764845.jpg?crop=6000,4000,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Jr1aQv95-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-29 17:04:04","author":"Owen Scott","authors":["Owen Scott"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.302},{"id":397412788,"title":"FBI Raid in Georgia Exposes Trump’s 2020 Election Fixation, Signals Potential Future Developments","text":"In Denver, Donald Trump has been persistently asserting that his 2020 election defeat was fraudulent, despite lacking evidence of widespread voter fraud. This narrative, now over five years old, has been a cornerstone of his attempts to sway public perception.\n\nWith his return to the presidency, Trump is doubling down on these assertions, urging federal authorities to validate his claims. Recently, the FBI executed a search warrant at the election headquarters in Fulton County, Georgia, encompassing much of Atlanta, to inspect ballots from the 2020 election. This action follows Trump’s remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he hinted that election-related charges were forthcoming.\n\n“Trump is uniquely positioned to act on his fixations, wielding the full might of the U.S. government,” commented Rick Hasen, a UCLA law professor. His statement reflects a broader concern that Trump is leveraging federal resources to pursue personal vendettas. \n\nObservers, including Hasen, see Trump’s directive to the FBI as part of a broader strategy to convert federal agencies into instruments of retribution. This approach has been increasingly evident throughout his administration.\n\nAdding to the controversy, Senator Jon Ossoff, a Democrat from Georgia, likened the FBI’s recent actions to another aggressive move by Trump—a Minnesota immigration crackdown that tragically resulted in the deaths of two U.S. citizen protesters. This was seen as a retaliatory strike against the state’s governor, who had previously challenged Trump as Kamala Harris’ vice-presidential candidate in the 2024 election.\n\nSen. Jon Ossoff, a Georgia Democrat, compared the search to the Minnesota immigration crackdown that has killed two U.S. citizen protesters, launched by Trump as his latest blow against the state’s governor, who ran against him as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate in 2024.\n\n“From Minnesota to Georgia, on display to the whole world, is a President spiraling out of control, wielding federal law enforcement as an unaccountable instrument of personal power and revenge,” Ossoff said in a statement.\n\nIt also comes as election officials across the country are starting to rev up for the 2026 midterms, where Trump is struggling to help his party maintain its control of Congress. Noting that, in 2020, Trump contemplated using the military to seize voting machines after his loss, some worry he’s laying the groundwork for a similar maneuver in the fall.\n\n“Georgia’s a blueprint,” said Kristin Nabers of the left-leaning group All Voting Is Local. “If they can get away with taking election materials here, what’s to stop them from taking election materials or machines from some other state after they lose?”\n\nGeorgia has been at the heart of Trump’s 2020 obsession. He infamously called Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Jan. 2, 2021, asking that Raffensperger “find” 11,780 more votes for Trump so he could be declared the winner of the state. Raffensperger refused, noting that repeated reviews confirmed Democrat Joe Biden had narrowly won Georgia.\n\nThose were part of a series of reviews in battleground states, often led by Republicans, that affirmed Biden’s win, including in Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada. Trump also lost dozens of court cases challenging the election results and his own attorney general at the time said there was no evidence of widespread fraud.\n\nHis allies who repeated his lies have been successfully sued for defamation. That includes former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who settled with two Georgia election workers after a court ruled he owed them $148 million for defaming them after the 2020 election.\n\nVoting machine companies also have brought defamation cases against some conservative-leaning news sites that aired unsubstantiated claims about their equipment being linked to fraud in 2020. Fox News settled one such case by agreeing to pay $787 million after the judge ruled it was “CRYSTAL clear” that none of the allegations were true.\n\nTrump’s campaign to move Georgia into his column also sparked an ill-fated attempt to prosecute him and some of his allies by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, a Democrat. The case collapsed after Willis was removed over conflict-of-interest concerns, and Trump has since sought damages from the office.\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump rewarded some of those who helped him try to overturn the 2020 election results by pardoning, commuting or vowing to dismiss the cases of about 1,500 people charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. He later signed an executive order trying to set new rules for state election systems and voting procedures, although that has been repeatedly blocked by judges who have ruled that the Constitution gives states, and in some instances Congress, control of elections rather than the president.\n\nAs part of his campaign of retribution, Trump also has spoken about wanting to criminally charge lawmakers who sat on the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack, suggesting protective pardons of them from Biden are legally invalid. He’s targeted a former cybersecurity appointee who assured the public in 2020 that the election was secure.\n\nDuring a year of presidential duties, from dealing with wars in Gaza and Ukraine to shepherding sweeping tax and spending legislation through Congress, Trump has reliably found time to turn the subject to 2020. He has falsely called the election rigged, said Democrats cheated and even installed a White House plaque claiming Biden took office after “the most corrupt election ever.”\n\nDavid Becker, a former Department of Justice voting rights attorney and executive director of The Center for Election Innovation & Research, said he was skeptical the FBI search in Georgia would lead to any successful prosecutions. Trump has demanded charges against several enemies such as former FBI Director James Comey and New York’s Democratic Attorney General, Letitia James, that have stalled in court.\n\n“So much this administration has done is to make claims in social media rather than go to court,” Becker said. “I suspect this is more about poisoning the well for 2026.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn Denver, Donald Trump has been persistently asserting that his 2020 election&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: FBI Raid in Georgia Exposes Trump&#8217;s 2020 Election Fixation, Signals Potential Future Developments first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/fbi-raid-in-georgia-exposes-trumps-2020-election-fixation-signals-potential-future-developments/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FBI-raid-in-Georgia-highlights-Trumps-2020-election-obsession-and-1024x576.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 16:51:38","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.221},{"id":397452666,"title":"Banned to back again: A timeline of TikTok's rise, fall and rebirth","text":"In its infancy, TikTok was often described as an app for teenagers' dance videos.In 2026, it's a juggernaut with some 200 million users in the United States who, after a deal struck Thursday, will have access to a new US TikTok of which its original Chinese owner, ByteDance, will own just less than 20%.The platform's path from a whimsical dance app to the target of a foreign diplomacy battle and a domestic ban has been dotted with recipes, niche drama, micro trends, new entries into the popular lexicon and overnight megastars.Here's a timeline of the app's meteoric rise, and a reminder of the videos that dominated your algorithm, whether you wanted them to or not.2012Zhang Yiming, a Chinese entrepreneur, founds ByteDance.
