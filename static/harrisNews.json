Under the EBE program, the SSA worked with the Department of Homeland Security to vet the legal status of immigrants in the country who were authorized to work, then automatically issued Social Security numbers.\n\n Kathleen Romig, a former Social Security official now with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, tells Rolling Stone the EBE program was created to more efficiently get legal immigrants into the system by automatically issuing them Social Security numbers instead of having them visit an SSA field office. \n\n “In 2017, the process began with issuing Social Security cards to noncitizens lawfully present in the U.S.,” says Romig. Under Biden, the Enumeration Beyond Entry program was expanded to include other categories of legal immigrants.\n\n In the first year of the Trump administration, the SSA issued 82,202 Social Security numbers under the EBE program and another 237,000 at field offices, according to the May 2018 congressional testimony of the agency’s then-commissioner, Nancy Berryhill. At the time, Berryhill was serving as the SSA’s acting commissioner because the Trump administration failed to appoint a nominee to lead the agency. \n\n On Sunday night, Musk and Gracias displayed their chart showing that the number of legal immigrants granted Social Security numbers — what the agency calls “enumeration” — under the program had increased during the Biden administration. This increase was the inevitable result of Biden’s more progressive policies toward legal immigrants, according to former SSA Commissioner Martin O’Malley. \n\n “The number of immigrants enumerated during the Biden administration increased because the number of lawfully admitted immigrants increased,” O’Malley says.\n\n Musk and Gracias didn’t explain any of this to those in attendance at Sunday’s event, instead painting the practice of automatically granting Social Security numbers to legal immigrants — as an example of waste and fraud. “This literally blew us away, like we went there to find fraud, and we found this by accident,” Gracias said.\n\n The legal immigrants who are granted Social Security numbers and were cited on the chart Musk and Gracias displayed would almost certainly include those on H1-B visas, which Musk has supported. Both Musk and Gracias are naturalized citizens who would have been granted Social Security numbers just like all the immigrants displayed on the chart.\n\n Legal immigrants are granted Social Security numbers — not benefits — so they can pay taxes. Musk claimed their chart was proof that Democrats, under Joe Biden, were trying “to import as many illegals as possible” in order to “change the entire voting map of the United States,” despite the fact that legal immigrants are not able to use a Social Security number to register to vote.\n\n The Trump administration and a spokesperson for Musk’s DOGE did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Gracias through his private equity firm, Valor Equity Partners.\n\n THE CHART THAT Musk and Gracias displayed showed a rise in the number of immigrants receiving Social Security numbers through the EBE program — from 964,000 in 2023 to more than 2 million in 2024. Musk and Gracias did not display the number of legal immigrants granted Social Security numbers during the first Trump administration. Gracias and Musk discussed the chart as if it were evidence that illegal immigrants were receiving Social Security benefits.\n\n The pair appeared to have failed to understand that the “noncitizens” who have received Social Security numbers reflected in their chart were legal immigrants who entered the U.S. on work or student visas, or who were otherwise legally authorized to work in the country. Either that, or they were lying to the audience. \n\n “All of the people who came in on that chart that you just saw, if the machine behind the Kamala puppet had won, then they would have actually legalized all those people and there would be no swing states,” Musk said of former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n “These people are just entering the benefit programs now, by the way,” Gracias added, again not pointing out that the “noncitizens” on the chart had simply been granted Social Security numbers — not benefits. \n\n Gracias and Musk’s comments are part of widespread claims that undocumented immigrants are receiving federal benefits like Social Security and Medicaid. The claims have been a regular feature of Republican talking points in the Trump era. \n\n Trump himself has repeatedly claimed that undocumented immigrants receive Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare benefits, which is illegal. In February, Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Mich.) introduced a bill that would prohibit undocumented immigrants from receiving Social Security benefits — which has been illegal since 1996, when changes were made to the Social Security Act excluding immigrants who are not “lawfully present” in the United States.\n\n To get a Social Security number, an undocumented immigrant would have to walk into a field office or apply online or over the phone — with fraudulent paperwork — O’Malley and Romig said. Musk claimed that undocumented immigrants “could actually just make it up. You could just show, like, a fake utility bill, or a medical bill and a school ID, and get a Social Security number and then from there you get on the voter rolls.” \n\n O’Malley says there is no evidence of undocumented immigrants applying for and being granted Social Security numbers — let alone receiving benefits. He called Musk and Gracias’ comments “another big lie.”\n\n “They love to confuse having a Social Security number with getting Social Security benefits,” O’Malley tells Rolling Stone, adding that claims that illegal immigrants are receiving Social Security benefits are “made up and intended to inflame their base.” \n\n “It’s just not true, and strutting in front of an American flag and putting it up a big graph doesn’t make it true,” O’Malley says.\n\n While there is no evidence that undocumented immigrants are receiving Social Security benefits, they do contribute to the system. In 2022, undocumented immigrants contributed $25.7 billion to Social Security — money that goes to American citizens who are beneficiaries of the program. \n\n Musk and Gracias’ claim that illegal immigrants are receiving Social Security benefits was quickly seized upon by Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), who posted on X that the practice of giving Social Security numbers to noncitizens “must end NOW.” Perry’s office did not immediately respond to questions regarding his post, or whether he believed that legal immigrants should not be given Social Security numbers in order to pay into the system. \n\n Under Trump, the SSA has halted some aspects of the Enumeration Beyond Entry program, according to an internal SSA memo obtained by Popular Information on March 20. Now, some legal immigrants in the country for work will have to apply for Social Security numbers in-person at SSA field offices. \n\n An influx of legal immigrants applying in-person for Social Security numbers will only add to the workloads of staffers in agency field offices — an issue compounded by the fact that DOGE has targeted dozens of SSA offices for closure.\n\n “It’s part of the overall effort to break Social Security’s ability to serve customers, and the leading edge of that is to pack already overworked field offices,” O’Malley tells Rolling Stone.","summary":"The DOGE chief is whining about “noncitizens” automatically getting Social Security numbers.

Wednesday will kick off his “Liberation Day” when his proposed tariffs will go into effect. Congress continues to negotiate his proposed “one big, beautiful bill” to cut taxes and ramp up defense and border spending while increasing oil production. \n\nSo far, there have been few ways for voters to register dissatisfaction on a large scale, save for a few one-off special elections to fill state legislative seats, where Democrats overperformed, a byproduct of how the Democratic Party has become one of highly-educated and high-propensity voters. \n\nBut Tuesday will be the first test for Democrats to see if they can turn dissatisfaction with Trump into votes or if Republicans can create a firewall – and if Trump indeed has a mandate.\n\nFirst, there’s Trump’s adopted home state of Florida. Matt Gaetz, the right-wing firebrand congressman, resigned his seat as soon as Trump nominated him to become attorney general, which never came to pass. But the real challenge will be in Florida’s sixth district, which Rep. Michael Waltz vacated when he came Trump’s national security adviser. \n\nRepublican Jimmy Patronis is almost guaranteed to win in Florida’s 1st. But as Inside Washington explained last week, Florida’s sixth district is becoming a tougher slog than imagined. For context, Trump won it by 30 points. \n\nBut Gov. Ron DeSantis and Randy Fine, a state senator, have repeatedly feuded going back to the governor’s ill-fated run for president. DeSantis has spent much of the last few weeks sniping at Fine, particularly because before Waltz won the seat in 2018, DeSantis held it before resigning to run for governor. \n\nBut Fine has proven to be a particularly toxic candidate. He previously said Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, both of whom are Muslim, “might consider leaving before I get there,” before using the hashtag #BombsAway. \n\nNot surprisingly, Elon Musk’s America PAC poured money into the race, spending more than $20,000 to support Patronis in the past week, according to reports from the Federal Election Commission. The PAC threw even more behind Fine, spending about $87,000 last week. \n\nDemocrats for their part have done a full-court press for Democrat Josh Weil. Ken Martin, the newly-minted chairman of the Democratic National Committee, went down south. Sen. Bernie Sanders also endorsed Weil.\n\nBoth Fine and Weil are Jewish, though Fine has depicted himself as a thoroughly pro-Israel Republican while in the past, Weil called for an end to U.S. military aid to Israel. \n\nDespite his baggage, Fine still is the favorite to win. But if Democrats cut into the margins significantly, it will show how the party can craft a winning message even in blood-red Florida. \n\nWhile the tussle in Florida is certainly entertaining, Musk and Democrats have made their main focus the election for a seat on Wisconsin’s supreme court the main prize on Tuesday evening. \n\nWhile the races are ostensibly non-partisan, the balance on the court is currently 4-3 with the liberals in control ever since Janet Protasiewicz won her race in 2023. Liberal justice Ann Walsh Bradley is retiring, meaning there is a closely-watched race between circuit judge Susan Crawford, a liberal, and former Republican attorney general Brad Schimel. \n\nOver the weekend, Elon Musk visited Wisconsin, where he gave two $1 million checks to Republican voters and decked himself out in the customary cheesehead. Specifically, Musk correctly pointed out that the court would determine the drawing of congressional districts in the swing state. \n\nAs of right now, Wisconsin only has two Democratic members of Congress and six Republicans. A new court could change that. Musk also has a vested interest because he has a legal fight in Wisconsin after Tesla was denied a request to open an auto dealership in the state. \n\nWisconsin’s Democratic Party, led by chairman Ben Wikler, is considered one of the best-run in the country. Despite Kamala Harris losing Wisconsin, it proved to be a bright spot last year in that she lost by a smaller margin than elsewhere, Democrats gained seats in the state legislature and Sen. Tammy Baldwin won re-election. \n\n“It is a shame that Elon Musk has gotten involved,” Baldwin told The Independent. “He has litigation in Wisconsin, that could end up before the supreme court. No wonder he’s putting so much money into Schimel’s campaign.” \n\nDemocrats have been demoralized ever since Trump’s win. Many more Democrats were furious when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voted to pass a Republican-written continuing resolution. Now, they have a real chance to show their anger, not just against Trump, but Musk directly.","summary":"Analysis: Elon Musk and Democrats both have their eyes on Florida’s congressional race and Wisconsin’s supreme court, writes Eric Garcia","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-musk-special-elections-wisconsin-florida-b2724770.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/31/19/11/SEI245782918.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/3rIgEcDW-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-31 20:58:02","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.338},{"id":306230768,"title":"World News | Rep.

Nikema Williams stepped down as chair of the Democratic Party of Georgia on Monday, five months after Kamala Harris' loss to Donald Trump in the southern swing state spotlighted discontent with her leadership. Williams' exit is one of several among Democratic parties as disgruntled partisans seek change after the electorate embraced Trump's return to the presidency. Also Read | Who Is Marine Le Pen? France's Far-Right Leader Convicted in Embezzlement Case, Banned From Running for Presidency. Several Georgia Democrats questioned whether someone could serve effectively as an elected official and party chair. The decision comes after the party's state committee voted Saturday to make the position paid and full-time. Williams agreed to the change, leading her to step down without a vote on her leadership. “For the party to meet the moment while honouring its commitment to working people, the role of chair cannot remain an uncompensated volunteer position,” Williams said in a statement.

Williams also withdrew her bid in February for vice chair of civic engagement and voter participation for the Democratic National Committee. The resignation came months after Democratic US Sen. Jon Ossoff reportedly urged Williams to resign. Ossoff faces reelection in 2026 and will be a top target nationally for the GOP. Some state Democratic lawmakers said Ossoff made Williams a scapegoat for the Democratic Party's deeper messaging problems. Williams was a lobbyist for Planned Parenthood Southeast when she joined party leadership, becoming first vice chair in 2011. She was elected as a state senator in 2017 and party chair in 2019. After US Rep John Lewis died in July 2020, the party's executive committee selected her to replace Lewis as the nominee, meaning Williams was elected in the strongly Democratic 5th Congressional District without having to win a party primary. Williams has cruised to reelection twice since then. There had long been some discontent with Williams' leadership of the Georgia party. As a sitting member of Congress, she is legally barred from raising money for the party's state campaign account. Raising money and recruiting candidates are two of the top jobs of any party chair. There were also questions about how much time Williams could devote to being a party chair while also attending to congressional duties. Although Harris won 75,000 more votes in Georgia in 2024 than Biden won in 2020, she lost the state's 16 electoral votes by 115,000 votes overall, compared to Biden's victory of less than 12,000. That's because Trump won 200,000 more votes than he did in 2020. The Republican turnout surge was particularly apparent outside metro Atlanta, where the complaints about Williams' leadership have been the loudest. Democrats in those areas are more likely to be dependent on party-raised money and its centrally led and coordinated campaign. Williams defended her legacy. “When I was elected to the role of chairwoman in 2019, Georgia was on the cusp of an extraordinary shift that few would buy into,\" she said. “Through strategic vision, relentless organizing, and an unwavering belief in the power of our people, we turned this state into the battleground it was always meant to be.” Georgia's Democratic Party will elect a new chair. Until then, first Vice Chair Matthew Wilson will serve as interim chair.

I’m focused on the current,” he said.\n\nBut is it even possible?\n\nThe 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution sounds pretty straightforward: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice”. \n\nThe amendment was a direct response to Franklin D Roosevelt’s four-term presidency, aiming to cement the two-term tradition established by the first US president George Washington. \n\nBut Mr Trump’s insinuations have rekindled discussions about the elasticity of this constitutional mandate. \n\n“There are methods which you could do it,” he said.\n\nAsked by host Kristen Welker if he was serious about the idea, Mr Trump responded: “No, no I’m not joking. I’m not joking.”\n\nIn January, Representative Andy Ogles of Tennessee introduced a resolution seeking to amend the 22nd Amendment. If successful, it would allow a president to serve a third term, provided the first two are non-consecutive, a scenario seemingly tailored solely to Mr Trump.\n\nNotably, it would mean, say, Barack Obama would be unable to serve a third term because his two terms were consecutive. \n\nThere are checks and balances to the system and the path to amending the Constitution is labyrinthine, requiring a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate or ratification from three-fourths of state legislatures.\n\nGiven the Republicans do not have the numbers for either of those tasks, it’s implausible the Constitution will be changed. \n\nMr Roosevelt stands alone as the only US president to have served more than two terms, a decision driven by the catastrophic period between the Great Depression and World War II. \n\nIn contrast, Mr Trump’s current tenure lacks such catalysts, rendering his third-term aspirations even more contentious.\n\nNevertheless, the US is wading into a murky pool of maybes and Mr Trump has demonstrated he is unafraid of lifting the hood and tinkering with things if it applies to his “Make America Great Again” philosophy. \n\nReactions have been mixed to say the least.\n\n“Donald Trump saying that he might run for a third term is not a joke and should not be taken lightly,” lawyer Aaron Parnas wrote. “At least a small part of him is serious … this is extremely dangerous”.\n\nOthers went further and claimed that Mr Trump’s actions leading up to the events on January 6th, where scores of protesters raided the capital, were proof he was an insurrectionist, which makes his current term unconstitutional under the 14th amendment.\n\n“The 14th amendment says that insurrectionists can’t hold office and that hasn’t stopped Trump, so why does anyone think a third term isn’t on the cards?” political researcher Will Jennings wrote.\n\n“This weekend Trump threatened to use military force against Greenland and run for a third term,” Robert E Kelly, professor of political science at Korea’s Pusan National University, said.\n\n“It’s hard to state just how frightening that should be. Those are presidency-ending comments in normal times. So it’s almost as unnerving that everyone’s response is, whatevs, it’s Trump.”\n\nTrump hardcore rally around third term\n\nFor his deeply-loyal fanbase, a third term of Trump is exactly what the country needs, as millions of Americans remain convinced the Democratic Party broke their nation beyond repair.\n\nFormer White House chief strategist and Trump’s long-time ally Steve Bannon has already started his own third term conga line, making international headlines with a speech at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) last month.\n\nWhen Bannon took the stage for a live edition of his War Room podcast, one attendee’s comment about “Trump 2028” set him off on a tangent.\n\n“What do we have to do to get Trump 2028?” the 71-year-old asked the crowd.\n\nWhen the man responded that the MAGA crowd had to continue to “show up and stay loud,” Bannon chimed in with a slightly more radical proposition.\n\n“Exactly. We’ve got to maybe work the Constitution too although I think there’s a way to slip through there but you never know,” he said.\n\nHow could it be slipped through?\n\nOne is a belief by some hardcore Trump supporters that the wording in the 22nd Amendment contains a loophole. That essentially if you make a deeply undemocratic move, Mr Trump could indeed serve more terms. \n\nThe amendment only bars someone from being “elected” for more than two terms. But what if they were appointed?\n\nThis scenario says that the current vice president JD Vance (or, really, anyone willing) could stand for president in 2028 with Mr Trump as their VP candidate. If elected as president, they could then stand down straightaway. The second in line would then be appointed president, which in this case would be Mr Trump.\n\nIf no new election took place, this would see an unelected president take over for potentially years, which would be deeply hypocritical for the Republicans. Remember how much the party said democracy had been ignored when Kamala Harris became the Democrat candidate without going through a series of primary battles? That’s despite there being no legal need for primaries to occur. And besides, Americans still had the opportunity to vote for Ms Harris.\n\nBut many lawyers say the “appointed” plan comes to halt due to the 12th Amendment, which bars a person \"ineligible” to be president to be appointed vice president. That would seem to rule out Mr Trump after his two terms.\n\nNonetheless, some are urging Mr Trump to try. If he did, it would be sure to end up in court. \n\n‘We want Trump 2028’\n\n“The future of MAGA is Donald J Trump. We want Trump in 2028,” Bannon yelled at CPAC.\n\n“A man like Trump only comes along once or twice in a country’s history, right? We want Trump.”\n\nHe even described him as an “instrument of divine providence” as if he was sent by the almighty himself to save America.\n\n“Human agency is what drives this world forward, this is the Holy Spirit working through us. That’s why Trump, General Washington and Lincoln come along every 100 years,” he continued.\n\n“He is an instrument of divine providence. Of course he is.\n\n“Look at what this Capital has become. The revolutionary generation never anticipated this imperial Capital. If they came back today, they would spit on the floor at what we’ve allowed to happen with the lords of easy money and the oligarchs.\n\n“They would say ‘hey, what we need is a populist nationalist revolution’ and guess what, Donald Trump gave them one.”","summary":"As chaos unfolds around him, Donald Trump has taken time to encourage a narrative that has sent a scare through the spines of his most vocal critics.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/those-are-presidencyending-comments-donald-trumps-third-term-ambitions-are-picking-up-steam/news-story/4f39e89617c1b4c647a159d8cf40bbc6?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/e74de307e98395d2e473a3536a216b58","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-31 20:25:53","author":"Alex Blair","authors":["Alex Blair"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.194},{"id":306218756,"title":"Tom Moran: A third term for Trump?

That takes a vote by two-thirds of the Congress, and ratification by at least 38 states. There is nothing on God’s earth that could build that kind of consensus in today’s America, not even apple pie.\n\nBut let’s say he finds a way. There is talk that JD Vance could run at the top of the ticket in 2028, with Trump as his vice-president. If that ticket won, the theory goes, Vance could resign, and Trump could resume his place on the throne without being “elected to the office more than twice.”\n\nIt’s a whacked-out plan, and would break a bunch of other good rules and norms, but can anyone rule out this Supreme Court offering its blessing? What about a Supreme Court with a few more Trump appointees on board by then?\n\n“A lot of people want me to do it,” Trump told NBC’s Kristen Welker on Sunday. “There are methods which you could do it, as you know.”\n\nGranted, this is delusional stuff. But so was Trump’s demand that Vice President Mike Pence overrule voters after the 2020 election. So are his plans to take over Greenland and Canada. If you’re looking for crazy, we could make a long list after just two months. He could actually try this. \n\n“The biggest mistake of the last eight years is that we somehow failed to give credibility to Donald Trump’s whims and impulses, but we know it’s true,” David Jolly, a former Republican member of Congress, told MSNBC. “January 6 was a perfect example. If he says he’s not ruling it out, then he’s not ruling it out, and we should consider it a constitutional threat.”\n\nSteven Levitsky is a Harvard professor who co-wrote the book \"How Democracies Die“ after studying the many cases in which leaders win legitimate elections, then corrode democracy by using the machinery of government to rig the game in their favor. They limit the power of judges or ignore their rulings, they undermine the free press, they change election rules, harass opponents with bogus criminal investigations, and peddle disinformation.\n\nSound familiar?\n\n Adolf Hitler is the famous case, winning his appointment as chancellor in 1933 only after the Nazis became the largest party in the Reichstag through free elections. But Levitsky considers the threat of old-school fascism overblown. He worries more about America becoming a fake democracy, as happened in places like Turkey, Hungary, and Venezuela.\n\n“The breakdown in democracy in the United States will not give rise to a classic dictatorship in which elections are a sham and the opposition is locked up, exiled or killed,” he writes in Foreign Affairs magazine. “What lies ahead is … a system in which parties compete in elections but the incumbent’s abuse of power tilts the playing field against the opposition. Most autocracies that have emerged since the end of the Cold War fall into this category.”\n\nTrump is following a playbook. And what scares me is that so many independent players are groveling at his feet, rather than standing on principle. Columbia University has agreed to give him some control over their curriculum on Mideast studies. The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times agreed to kill editorial endorsements of Kamala Harris. Two big law firms just degraded themselves by agreeing spend a combined $140 million on legal work for causes that Trump supports.\n\n And notice that Attorney General Pam Bondi signaled that she won’t investigate the blunder we just witnessed when Trump’s senior national security team spilled plans for the attack on Houthi militants in Yemen on a commercial app hours before it was launched, putting the mission and our pilots in danger. Lower-ranked players might be facing prison time under the Espionage Act, which criminalizes not just intentional leaks, but those showing “gross negligence.”\n\nWhat worries me most is not the prospect of a third term for Trump. My guess is voters will sour on him long before 2028 anyway. But his comments are revealing about his mindset. The man respects no restraints on his power.\n\nThe bigger stress test will come if he defies major court rulings. He’s already testing the limits on a few cases, including the decision to proceed with deportation of what he says are Venezuelan gang members despite a judge’s oral order to stop those flights.\n\nLet’s say he take the next step, and explicitly defies a ruling on a major issue, like his refusal to spend money allocated by Congress on agencies like USAID. If the Court orders him to reverse course, will he obey?\n\n“Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power,” Vice President JD Vance posted on social media.\n\nYes, but it’s the judges who get to decide what’s legitimate and what’s not. Vance doesn’t seem to get that. And neither does Trump, who chillingly said, “He who saves his country does not violate any law.”\n\nI expect this crew to make a charge at our democracy. They don’t give a damn.\n\nBut the United States is not Turkey, or Hungary, or Venezuela. We have a strong and independent judiciary. We have state governments controlled by the opposition.

And as Levitzky notes, Trump’s popularity is limited. “An elected autocrat with 45 percent approval rating is dangerous, but less dangerous than one with 80 percent support,” he writes.\n\nSo, its’ game on.

Crazy, but revealing.","text":"President Donald Trump told NBC news last weekend that he’s dead serious about serving a third term as president, no matter what that dusty old Constitution says.\n\nHe knows he can’t hope to pave the way by amending the Constitution, as one of his bootlickers in the House has proposed. That takes a vote by two-thirds of the Congress, and ratification by at least 38 states. There is nothing on God’s earth that could build that kind of consensus in today’s America, not even apple pie.\n\nBut let’s say he finds a way. There is talk that JD Vance could run at the top of the ticket in 2028, with Trump as his vice-president. If that ticket won, the theory goes, Vance could resign, and Trump could resume his place on the throne without being “elected to the office more than twice.”\n\nIt’s a whacked-out plan, and would break a bunch of other good rules and norms, but can anyone rule out this Supreme Court offering its blessing? What about a Supreme Court with a few more Trump appointees on board by then?\n\n“A lot of people want me to do it,” Trump told NBC’s Kristen Welker on Sunday. “There are methods which you could do it, as you know.”\n\nGranted, this is delusional stuff. But so was Trump’s demand that Vice President Mike Pence overrule voters after the 2020 election. So are his plans to take over Greenland and Canada. If you’re looking for crazy, we could make a long list after just two months. He could actually try this. \n\n“The biggest mistake of the last eight years is that we somehow failed to give credibility to Donald Trump’s whims and impulses, but we know it’s true,” David Jolly, a former Republican member of Congress, told MSNBC. “January 6 was a perfect example. If he says he’s not ruling it out, then he’s not ruling it out, and we should consider it a constitutional threat.”\n\nSteven Levitsky is a Harvard professor who co-wrote the book \"How Democracies Die“ after studying the many cases in which leaders win legitimate elections, then corrode democracy by using the machinery of government to rig the game in their favor. They limit the power of judges or ignore their rulings, they undermine the free press, they change election rules, harass opponents with bogus criminal investigations, and peddle disinformation.\n\nSound familiar?\n\n Adolf Hitler is the famous case, winning his appointment as chancellor in 1933 only after the Nazis became the largest party in the Reichstag through free elections. But Levitsky considers the threat of old-school fascism overblown. He worries more about America becoming a fake democracy, as happened in places like Turkey, Hungary, and Venezuela.\n\n“The breakdown in democracy in the United States will not give rise to a classic dictatorship in which elections are a sham and the opposition is locked up, exiled or killed,” he writes in Foreign Affairs magazine. “What lies ahead is … a system in which parties compete in elections but the incumbent’s abuse of power tilts the playing field against the opposition. Most autocracies that have emerged since the end of the Cold War fall into this category.”\n\nTrump is following a playbook. And what scares me is that so many independent players are groveling at his feet, rather than standing on principle. Columbia University has agreed to give him some control over their curriculum on Mideast studies. The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times agreed to kill editorial endorsements of Kamala Harris. Two big law firms just degraded themselves by agreeing spend a combined $140 million on legal work for causes that Trump supports.\n\n And notice that Attorney General Pam Bondi signaled that she won’t investigate the blunder we just witnessed when Trump’s senior national security team spilled plans for the attack on Houthi militants in Yemen on a commercial app hours before it was launched, putting the mission and our pilots in danger. Lower-ranked players might be facing prison time under the Espionage Act, which criminalizes not just intentional leaks, but those showing “gross negligence.”\n\nWhat worries me most is not the prospect of a third term for Trump. My guess is voters will sour on him long before 2028 anyway. But his comments are revealing about his mindset. The man respects no restraints on his power.\n\nThe bigger stress test will come if he defies major court rulings. He’s already testing the limits on a few cases, including the decision to proceed with deportation of what he says are Venezuelan gang members despite a judge’s oral order to stop those flights.\n\nLet’s say he take the next step, and explicitly defies a ruling on a major issue, like his refusal to spend money allocated by Congress on agencies like USAID. If the Court orders him to reverse course, will he obey?\n\n“Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power,” Vice President JD Vance posted on social media.\n\nYes, but it’s the judges who get to decide what’s legitimate and what’s not. Vance doesn’t seem to get that. And neither does Trump, who chillingly said, “He who saves his country does not violate any law.”\n\nI expect this crew to make a charge at our democracy. They don’t give a damn.\n\nBut the United States is not Turkey, or Hungary, or Venezuela. We have a strong and independent judiciary. We have state governments controlled by the opposition. We have midterm elections, and a free press with strong protections. And as Levitzky notes, Trump’s popularity is limited. “An elected autocrat with 45 percent approval rating is dangerous, but less dangerous than one with 80 percent support,” he writes.\n\nSo, its’ game on. This fight is only beginning. And my money is still on democracy.\n\n Moran is a national political columnist for Advance Local and the former editorial page editor/columnist for The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J.

She wasn’t transparent about it. Logistically, it was a pain in the butt.’ \n\nO’Malley Dillon did not respond to a request for comment. \n\nHarris filmed the video spot on Wednesday, July 24 while she was in Indianapolis to address the Zeta Phi Beta sorority. \n\nIt was released the following Friday morning. \n\n‘To seem real, Harris had to fake surprise and enthusiasm about what should have been an obvious endorsement from both Obamas,’ Allen and Parnes wrote. \n\nThe final script had Harris feigning surprise that both Obamas were on the line.\n\n‘Ohh hi, you’re both together. It’s good to hear you both,’ Harris said, after being handed a phone by an aide. \n\nBoth Barack and Michelle said they were proud of Harris, as she told them, ‘We’re going to have some fun with this too, aren’t we?’ \n\nFor Harris, Allen and Parnes wrote, ‘the optics of unity had taken on the utmost importance. So the quality and authenticity of the endorsement moment took a back seat.’ \n\n‘It took days of intense negotiations to strike a deal on the simplest act in politics,’ they continued. ‘The whole frame, including the script, was designed to elevate the Obamas by making it look like she was begging for their blessing.’ \n\n‘This was typical bulls***,’ the authors said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJust three days after President Joe Biden left the 2024 presidential race, Vice President&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The Real Story Behind the Viral Obama Video Supporting Kamala Harris first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/the-real-story-behind-the-viral-obama-video-supporting-kamala-harris/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-The-truth-behind-the-cringe-video-of.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-31 19:41:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.45},{"id":306238326,"title":"Failed VP Candidate Tim Walz: 'I Can Be a Train Wreck' Sometimes","text":"Failed vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov.

I said about 90 percent of the time, I can be really good, but about 10 percent of the time, I can be a train wreck because I’m speaking from the heart, like a teacher sitting in a teachers’ lounge or a laborer sitting at the break table.”\n\n“I thought they would choose the district attorney and the teacher over the hedge-fund manager and the billionaire,” he added.\n\nIn November, President Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election a second time after an intense campaign in which he was targeted by would-be assassins twice, according to Breitbart News.\n\n“In victory, Trump completed what is indisputably the greatest political comeback in American history.

Here’s what buyers should know","text":"What are the tariffs?\n\nThe tariffs Trump announced last week will affect foreign-made cars and certain foreign-made auto parts by invoking a 25% tariff upon their import. The impacts of the auto tariffs will be in addition to other reciprocal tariffs, White House officials said last week after the announcement.\n\nWill the tariffs affect cars from U.S. brands?\n\nCars from U.S.-based automakers, including the Big Three Detroit automakers — Ford, Stellantis, and General Motors — will not be immune from the tariffs, due to where the cars themselves are assembled and where the parts come from.\n\nFord assembles roughly 80% of its vehicles in the U.S., while Stellantis assembles 73%-75% of its vehicles domestically, and General Motors makes 45% of its vehicles in the U.S., according to CBS News. \n\nThe remaining cars not manufactured in the U.S. would be susceptible to the 25% tariff, but even those vehicles made domestically would not necessarily be free from the tariffs.\n\nThe tariffs Trump has outlined also take aim at some car parts imported into the U.S., which includes those used in vehicles assembled domestically. Some foreign car parts, engines and engine parts, transmissions and powertrain parts, and electrical components, will also see 25% tariffs in the forthcoming action by the president.\n\nTesla, which assembles all of its cars in the U.S., will not be unscathed, according to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who posted on X that the impact of tariffs on the company would be “still significant.”\n\nHow will cars from foreign brands be affected?\n\nThe main target of these tariffs is foreign car brands, as the vast majority of cars from foreign companies are made outside of the U.S.\n\nSeveral foreign-made car brands, including Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Honda, assemble some of their cars for the U.S. market domestically and would be immune from the 25% tariffs on those vehicles.\n\nWhile most foreign auto brands manufacture their vehicles abroad, several of the models they do make in the U.S. are heavily reliant on foreign auto parts, according to Department of Transportation data.\n\nLower-cost vehicles could also be negatively affected by tariffs, according to Reuters, as many foreign automakers manufacture several popular entry-level cars and do so outside of the U.S.\n\nWill this affect the cost of car repairs?\n\nWhile tariffs will have an immediate effect on car owners when they purchase new vehicles, they could also become a rising cost for consumers who are not in the market for new vehicles.\n\nRepairs to cars that require expensive new parts, including engines and transmissions, could cost significantly more as many of those parts come from outside the U.S. Some analysts also worry that increasing the scope of the car parts affected by tariffs would further increase repair costs for consumers.\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nThe impact on the auto industry is expected to be immediate, but some analysts have said the limited tariffs on auto parts have helped lessen the effect most U.S.-made cars will see on their costs.\n\n“The announcement that all imported vehicles will see 25% tariffs will have a broader impact on the auto market. However, since the tariffs do not at least immediately apply to parts, it may not be as disruptive to U.S. vehicle production as we had feared,” Cox Automotive Chief Economist Jonathan Smoke said in a report from the firm.\n\nThe American Automotive Policy Council, which represents the three major domestic automakers, said they are “committed to President Trump’s vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S.” but also warn that “it is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers.”\n\nThe foreign automakers are less enthusiastic about the tariffs. Autos Drive America, which represents various foreign automakers in the U.S., warned the tariffs “will make it more expensive to produce and sell cars in the United States, ultimately leading to higher prices, fewer options for consumers, and fewer manufacturing jobs in the U.S.”\n\nUAW COURTS DONALD TRUMP AFTER GOING ALL IN FOR KAMALA HARRIS\n\nTrump has labeled Wednesday, when the tariffs are due to take effect, as “liberation day,” and he has said that the tariffs could be permanent as a way of getting consumers to purchase U.S.-made vehicles.\n\nThe Trump administration’s tariffs have concerned some analysts, but have an ally in autoworkers unions, with United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain praising the efforts in the past week.","summary":"President Donald Trump has promised tariffs on foreign carmakers, but the effects of those tariffs could mean higher costs for consumers on a variety of items, including repairs.

From a black child with brain cancer being hoisted by his father to thunderous applause to … suicide? \n\nIt’s essentially the same question Americans have asked themselves about progressives for years: What’s wrong with these people? \n\nOf course, there are many answers. For one, progressives seem to struggle with expressing joy. Ironically, this was laid bare by former Vice President Kamala Harris‘s feigned “joy” campaign, which attempted to mask venomous misery with Beyonce and balloons. Progressives are also humorless and often witless, which is why “resistance” comedy is so terrible and Democrats can’t meme. And they revere ugliness, the kind that drives pleasant-looking people to dye their hair the color of Kool-Aid. \n\nBut a comment Wallace made before her grim aside exposed the deeper thread tying these traits together:\n\n“I think this was a lesson in finding one thing that you let yourself feel,” she said. “And I let myself feel joy about D.J.” (emphasis mine).\n\nThe comment was revelatory because experiencing joy in that moment should have required no special form of self-permission. The natural human reaction was to cheer or cry, as many did. However, the Democrats in attendance suppressed their natural human instincts in service of their worldview — they sat on their hands while America roared. Wallace at least allowed herself a brief moment of human feeling before correcting course and pivoting to doom.\n\nThe scene underscored the fundamental trait of progressivism: To live this worldview faithfully, one must suppress natural human instincts and allow only rare and curated bursts of feeling. Being a progressive requires a perverse mastery of the mind over the heart, especially in relation to the pursuit of self-interest and the nature of the human person. \n\nFor a nation eager to unwind decades of progressive “progress,” unmasking this fundamental characteristic is an important step toward reclaiming what makes us human and what makes our nation great. \n\nSuppressing self-interest\n\nTo implement the progressive worldview, the pursuit of self-interest must be stifled, which is no small task. The drive to secure shelter, food, and sexual partners to pass on genes was established long before humans developed language. The brain’s natural reward systems light up when we pursue food, money, and social status. Self-interest is programmed into our biology. It’s as natural as breathing. \n\nOf course, as civilization developed, humans became concerned with “the greater good,” not only because it worked toward survival but because of our moral development. The most consequential moral teacher to ever live, Jesus of Nazareth, taught his followers to love one another as they loved themselves. This was not a call to malign or repress self-interest but to heed the heart’s natural tug to help the impoverished. Indeed, to love others as we love ourselves is useless if we don’t love ourselves at all.\n\nThis ethical framework informed the creation of the modern free-market system, which harnesses self-interest while lifting the poor from poverty. Led by America, this economic model has slashed poverty rates and sparked innovation, drastically raising the standard of living for billions of people.\n\nMeanwhile, economies that suppressed and disincentivized the pursuit of self-interest had no such success. The Soviet Union, Mao’s communist agrarianism, post-revolution Cuba, etc., bred stagnation and misery through state-controlled industries and excessive redistribution.\n\nIndeed, suppressing the pursuit of self-interest cuts sharply against natural instincts and defies all available historical evidence. Modern-day progressives would deny that they are proposing a drastic shift, but their guiding economic principle suggests otherwise. \n\nThe use of the term “equity” exploded late last decade, though its meaning was often obscured. The famous “baseball fence” illustration showing people of different heights being boosted up according to their needs struck many as self-evidently good. After all, why shouldn’t everyone have the same view? \n\nThe problem, of course, is that it’s impossible to quantify all the variables necessary to see who stands above whom and to what degree. People of African descent, it may be argued, have historically had a tougher time in the job market than people of European descent. However, given the range of additional variables that affect employment outcomes, from individual intelligence to attractiveness to personality markers, it is impossible to determine with certainty how much of a boost each person requires to see over the fence. \n\nScorning complexity, progressives push to engineer equal outcomes in education and employment along group identity lines. This necessarily requires reducing the height of some as much as raising the height of others. Making sure “we all end up in the same place,” as Harris famously said in 2020, means stifling the natural instinct toward self-interest for many.\n\nSuppressing natural sexuality\n\nThe suppression of natural sexuality is another priority for progressives. Since the sexual revolution of the 1960s, they’ve endeavored to rewire human sexual relations by suppressing the reproductive drive and replacing objective sexual categories with a socially constructed spectrum.\n\nTo be sure, the reproductive instinct is among the most powerful. Every species prioritizes passing on its genes. Our biological reward systems, including oxytocin and dopamine spikes, as well as physical pleasure, encourage the act for this reason. \n\nBut for three generations, the pro-abortion movement has helped normalize the most unnatural act of all: a mother taking the life of her own child. Since Roe v. Wade in 1973, approximately 1.3 million babies have been aborted each year on average. Birth rates have fallen 25% in that span, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drastically aging the population. Census projections show that seniors will outnumber children by 2035.\n\n“Be fruitful and multiply” was considered a self-evident moral good for millennia. This wasn’t merely sentimental but a necessity for survival. Having children meant having help on the farm or at the store. It meant energy and innovation that would help the family and community thrive. It meant more responsibility and toil but also greater satisfaction and meaning. Until very recently in history, our natural instinct to reproduce was aligned with our guiding values and priorities. However, the progressive influence has ruptured this alignment, convincing many to suppress the drive to reproduce in the name of greater “freedom,” which is often illusory since parents live longer, report higher levels of happiness, and suffer lower costs and loneliness in old age.\n\nEradicating natural distinctions between men and women is another crucial step for progressives. They see sexual differences as a deep root of inequality since different gender roles yield unequal outcomes in income and power. The complementarity of the sexes and the meaning and fulfillment this partnership has brought humans for millennia don’t factor into their equation. The goal is to flatten outcomes by any means necessary. That means erasing sexual differences, even among children, which is only achievable through unnatural means.\n\nThe normalization of tampering with children’s natural sexual development in the form of puberty blockers and risky surgeries speaks to the Left’s blind obsession with overpowering nature. The use of these “treatments” has skyrocketed in recent years, bolstering the notion of a social contagion. The number of children diagnosed with gender dysphoria tripled from 2017 to 2021, and puberty blocker usage spiked 400% from 2014 to 2021, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association. The children experimented upon can expect permanently reduced bone density, damaged fertility, stunted cognitive function, and impaired sexual function. \n\nThe sudden explosion in the use of “personal pronouns” among progressives was another attempt at mastering nature. However, the idea that society should be expected to memorize hundreds of different combinations for different individuals was patently ridiculous and flamed out naturally. Declaring one’s pronouns to begin a conversation was so unnatural that not even progressives could do it with a straight face. \n\nOf course, human instinct must occasionally be checked, especially in terms of greed and lust. However, this is a matter of mastery, not mutilation. It’s a matter of harnessing nature, not twisting it in service of ideological ends. \n\nOne way to tell the difference is to ask: Is my behavior building up my humanity or beating it down? Unlike Wallace, America should embrace its natural humanity once more — surely, this would make it great again.","summary":"America winced at MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace’s comments following President Donald Trump’s speech to the joint session of Congress in early March, during which 13-year-old cancer survivor D.J.

While he slammed Trump’s order to end collective bargaining for federal workers during a CBS interview Sunday, he heaped praise on the president at an appearance at a Detroit university. \"Yes, I disagree with Donald Trump on virtually everything, but [tariffs are] one thing I don’t disagree on,\" Fain said at Wayne State University, according to the Detroit Free Press. \"We’ve begged Democrats, politicians for years, to do something to get these companies in line.\" BIDEN'S UAW STRIKE VISIT LAMBASTED AS ‘SELF-DEFEATING’ AMID EV ‘FANTASY’ Fain – who famously wore a shirt to a former Vice President Kamala Harris rally that read, \"Trump is a scab; vote Harris,\" and who Trump said should be fired during his convention speech – called the president the first in his lifetime to eliminate problematic trade deals like NAFTA. \"I’m not going to sit here now and say that since he’s a Republican or because he’s Donald Trump, I’m going to say, ‘screw you.’ That’s not how we do things. It’s having integrity,\" he said, according to the paper. Fox News Digital reached out to Fain via the UAW for further comment. Trump instituted 25% tariffs on outsourced cars and auto parts last week, which is primed to hit domestic brands like Chevrolet – which now produces vehicles in Mexico like the popular Equinox, and shuttered its major Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant in 2020. Other manufacturers like Mack Trucks still make their vehicles in the U.S., with the Bulldog-branded manufacturing rigs at their longtime main plant in Macungie, Pennsylvania, and their powertrain facility in Hagerstown, Maryland. AUTOWORKERS FOR TRUMP LEADER SAYS THOUSANDS OF VOTERS POISED TO BREAK FROM DEMS While Fain reportedly said automakers cannot essentially wave a wand and reboot domestic production, he also said there is no reason U.S. automakers need to raise prices to withstand the financial hit. He called out \"corporate greed\" in that regard while adding Dodge had produced its Ram trucks in Warren, Michigan, for decades and does not need to suddenly move Ram \"overflow\" south of the border either. \"In fairness to the companies, they can’t just close a factory and open a brand new factory overnight… But there are a lot of opportunities right now.\" Fain alleged automakers used the COVID-19 price spike to \"price-gouge\" up to 40% \"for no reason.\" \"They’ve made massive profits for a decade, and all they see here is an opportunity… it’s a choice.\" \"They could shift that work back to Warren tomorrow and produce trucks there. Those are the things that can happen immediately.\" A White House spokesman said the administration welcomes Fain on board when it comes to tariffs. \"We’re glad that UAW leadership has finally recognized what’s long been clear to UAW members: President Trump backs America’s blue-collar workers, and America’s blue-collar workers back President Trump,\" said spokesman Kush Desai. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When asked about potential price hikes and cases of U.S. automakers making vehicles abroad that could be hurt by said tariffs, Desai said \"iconic automakers like Stellantis and Hyundai have already responded to President Trump’s America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, tax cuts, and the unleashing of American energy with tens of billions in historic Made-In-America investment commitments.\" Desai added that Trump’s push for Americans to be able to deduct taxes on U.S.-made cars will drive the onshoring of manufacturing and job growth without systemic inflation. \"Just as President Trump’s policies did during his first term,\" he said.","summary":"UAW President Shawn Fain praised President Donald Trump&apos;s tariffs over the weekend at a speech at Wayne State, saying Democrats could have acted better on trade and offshoring.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-his-tariffs-find-unlikely-ally-uaw-boss-who-blasted-dems-corporate-greed","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/01/931/523/fain_trump.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-31 16:40:55","author":"Charles Creitz","authors":["Charles Creitz"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.277},{"id":306198410,"title":"Third term for Trump? How the US president could sidestep the constitutional bar to remain in power","text":"President Donald Trump told an NBC interviewer on March 30, 2025, that he was “not joking” about a third term as president, despite such a term being barred by the Constitution.\n\n“There are methods which you could do it,” he said in the interview.\n\nFor months, Trump has been hinting – in joking tones – that he’s interested in finding a way to continue in the White House past the legal limit of two terms. But the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution is clear that Trump can’t be elected again. The text of the amendment states: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.”\n\nThat amendment was passed in response to Franklin Roosevelt’s four elections to the presidency. Since George Washington had stepped down at the end of his second term, no president had sought a third term, much less a fourth. The amendment was clearly meant to prevent presidents from serving more than two terms in office.\n\nBecause Trump has been elected president twice already, the plain language of the amendment bars him from being elected a third time. Some have argued that since Trump’s terms were nonconsecutive, the amendment doesn’t apply to him. But the amendment makes no distinction between consecutive and nonconsecutive terms in office.\n\nThough the 22nd Amendment prohibits Trump from being elected president again, it does not prohibit him from serving as president beyond January 20, 2029. The reason for this is that the 22nd Amendment only prohibits someone from being “elected” more than twice. It says nothing about someone becoming president in some other way than being elected to the office.\n\nSkirting the rules\n\nThere are a few potential alternate scenarios. Under normal circumstances, they would be next to impossible. But Donald Trump has never been a normal president.\n\nOn issue after issue, Trump has pushed the outer limits of presidential power. Most importantly, he has already shown his willingness to bend or even break the law to stay in office. And while Trump claims he’s only joking when he floats the idea of a third term, he has a long history of using “jokes” as a way of floating trial balloons.\n\nFurthermore, once he leaves office, Trump could once again face the prospect of criminal prosecution and possibly jail time, further motivating him to stay in power. As Trump’s second term progresses, don’t be surprised if Americans hear more about how he might try to stay in office. Here is what the Constitution says about that prospect.\n\nOther ways to become president\n\nNine people have served as president without first being elected to that office. John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Chester Arthur, Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford were all vice presidents who stepped into the office when their predecessors either died or resigned.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment does not bar a term-limited president from being elected vice president. On the other hand, the 12th Amendment does state that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of the President shall be eligible to that of the Vice-President of the United States.”\n\nIt’s not clear whether this restriction applies to a two-term president who is ineligible for a third term because of the 22nd Amendment – or whether it merely imposes on the vice president the Constitution’s other criteria for presidential eligibility, namely that they be a natural-born citizen of the United States, at least 35 years of age and have lived in the U.S. for at least 14 years.\n\nThat question would have to be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. Should the justices decide in Trump’s favor – as they have recently on questions regarding the 14th Amendment’s insurrection clause and presidential immunity – then the 2024 ticket of Trump-Vance could become the 2028 Vance-Trump ticket. If elected, Vance could then resign, making Trump president again.\n\nNo resignation needed\n\nBut Vance would not even have to resign in order for a Vice President Trump to exercise the power of the presidency. The 25th Amendment to the Constitution states that if a president declares that “he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office … such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President.”\n\nIn fact, the US has had three such acting presidents – George H.W. Bush, Dick Cheney and Kamala Harris. All of them held presidential power for a brief period when the sitting president underwent anesthesia during medical procedures; Cheney did it twice.\n\nIn this scenario, shortly after taking office on Jan. 20, 2029, President Vance could invoke the 25th Amendment by notifying the speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate that he is unable to discharge the duties of president. He would not need to give any reason or proof of this incapacity.\n\nVice President Trump would then become acting president and assume the powers of the presidency until such time as President Vance issued a new notification indicating that he was able to resume his duties as president.\n\n‘Tandemocracy’\n\nBut exercising the power of the presidency doesn’t even necessarily require being president or acting president.\n\nTrump has repeatedly expressed his admiration for autocratic Russian President Vladimir Putin, so he might want to follow the example of the Medvedev-Putin “tandemocracy.”\n\nIn 2008, term limits in the Russian constitution prevented Putin from running for president after two consecutive terms. Instead, he selected a loyal subordinate, Dmitry Medvedev, to run for president.\n\nWhen elected, Medvedev appointed Putin as his prime minister. By most accounts, Putin remained firmly in power and made most of the important decisions. Following this example, a future Republican president could appoint Trump to an executive branch position from which he could still exercise power.\n\nIn 2012, Putin was able to run for president again, and he and Medvedev once again swapped roles. Since then, Putin has succeeded in amending the Russian Constitution to effectively allow him to remain president for the rest of his life.\n\nUsing a figurehead\n\nThen again, Trump might just want to avoid all of these legal subterfuges by following the example of George and Lurleen Wallace. In 1966, the Alabama Constitution prevented Wallace from running for a third consecutive term as governor. Still immensely popular and unwilling to give up power, Wallace chose to have his wife, Lurleen, run for governor. It was clear from the beginning that Lurleen was just a figurehead for George, who promised to be an adviser to his wife, at a salary of $1 a year.\n\nThe campaign’s slogan of “Two Governors, One Cause,” made it clear that a vote for Lurleen was really a vote for George.\n\nLurleen won in a landslide.\n\nAccording to one account of her time in office, the Wallaces had “something of a Queen-Prime Minister relationship: Mrs. Wallace handles the ceremonial and formal duties of state. Mr. Wallace draws the grand outlines of state policy and sees that it is carried out”.\n\nTrump’s wife was not born a US citizen and therefore isn’t eligible to be president. But as the head of the Republican Party, Trump could ensure that the next GOP presidential candidate was a member of his family or some other person who would be absolutely loyal and obedient to him. If that person went on to win the White House in 2028, Trump could serve as an unofficial adviser, allowing him to continue to wield the power of the presidency without the actual title.\n\nPhilip Klinkner is James S Sherman Professor of Government, Hamilton College.\n\nThis article was first published on The Conversation.","summary":"The country’s constitution only prohibits someone from being elected more than twice.","url":"https://scroll.in/article/1080834/third-term-for-trump-how-the-us-president-could-sidestep-the-constitutional-bar-to-remain-in-power","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/206536-saycjksqhi-1743415119.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-31 16:30:01","author":"Philip Klinkner,The Conversation","authors":["Philip Klinkner","The Conversation"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"IN","sentiment":-0.48},{"id":306172132,"title":"WATCH: Chuck Todd issues ‘warning’ to Kamala Harris about her political future","text":"Political analyst Chuck Todd cautioned former Vice President Kamala Harris about running for California governor in 2026.\n\nHarris will decide whether to run for the governorship of her state by the end of the summer, she told a pre-Oscars party attendee, according to two individuals with knowledge of the discussion, Politico reported. When “News Conference” host Conan Nolan asked whether Harris will run for the position and whether she should, Todd said he would be surprised if she did, and that it would be challenging for her to win.\n\n“Boy, I would be shocked if she does. If she wants to run for president in ‘28, you can’t run for governor of California in ‘26,” Todd said. “So I do think if she runs for governor, she’s made the decision she’s not running.”\n\nTodd also highlighted the challenge a typical Democrat could face in winning the governorship after years of one-party control.\n\n“Here’d be my warning to any conventional Democrat running for governor of California in ‘26: Go look at the track record of any political party trying to win a governorship for basically for 20 straight years,” he said. “It doesn’t happen very often, right? And so this is 16 straight years of Democratic governance in California. It’s the longest, I think, going back nearly a hundred years.”\n\nTodd also argued Harris’ status as a long-time powerful politician could work against her if she were to run for the governorship.\n\n“Governor is the one place where voters won’t always vote their jersey color, and I think voters are going to be looking for somebody from the outside,” the political analyst said. “And I think that Harris — somebody who’s the former vice president, former U.S. senator, former district attorney in San Francisco — how does she sell change? She’s got to somehow run against Gavin Newsom’s governorship.”\n\n“So I just don’t see the path for her. I could see an outsider Democrat being able to message this. I think it’s a tough place for her to be,” he added. “If I were advising her, I’d tell her: go throw yourself into the rebuild of LA and get involved with the LA Olympic Committee. Be above politics for a couple of years and come back maybe in 2030 or 2032.”\n\nHarris ultimately lost all seven swing-states and the popular vote to President Donald Trump in November. When she ran for president in 2020, she only secured 844 votes in the Democratic primary, gaining zero delegates in the process, according to archived election data.\n\nPolitical analyst Mark Halperin argued in December that Harris would face an uphill battle, whether she runs for president again or enters the race for California governor.\n\n“I think her chance[s] of being governor of California are greater than being the Democratic nominee, but I don’t think they’re as great as people say, because again, her challenge is her weakness,” Halperin said. “She does not like to make difficult choices under pressure, and that is the job description for running for governor of California, being governor of California, running for president, being president.\n\n“So I think she might try, but I think she’d be surprised at how tough it is. And finally, I’ll say I’m not sure she wants to be governor of California,” he continued. “It’s not a great job right now, and so why she’d run and risk losing, and then if she did win, get the job — I’m not really sure.”\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

At least 14 have adopted laws restricting which bathrooms transgender people can use in certain buildings.\n\nIn February, Iowa became the first state to remove protections for transgender people from civil rights law.\n\nIt’s not just political gamesmanship. “I think that whether or not that’s a politically viable strategy is second to the immediate impact that that is going to have on trans people,” Fordham’s Murib said.\n\nMany voters think transgender rights have gone too far\n\nMore than half of voters in the 2024 election — 55% — said support for transgender rights in the United States has gone too far, according to AP VoteCast. About 2 in 10 said the level of support has been about right, and a similar share said support hasn’t gone far enough.\n\nNevertheless, AP VoteCast also found voters were split on laws banning gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers or hormone therapy, for minors. Just over half were opposed to these laws, while just under half were in favor.\n\nTrump voters were overwhelmingly likely to say support for transgender rights has gone too far, while Kamala Harris’ voters were more divided. About 4 in 10 Harris voters said support for transgender rights has not gone far enough, while 36% said it’s been about right and about one-quarter said it’s gone too far.\n\nA survey this year from the Pew Research Center found Americans, including Democrats, have become more slightly more supportive of requiring transgender athletes to compete on teams that match their sex at birth and more supportive on bans on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors since 2022. Most Democrats still oppose those kinds of measures, though.\n\nLeor Sapir, a fellow at Manhattan Institute, a right-leaning think tank, says Trump’s and Republicans’ positions have given them a political edge.\n\n“They are putting their opponents, their Democratic opponents, in a very unfavorable position by having to decide between catering to their progressive, activist base or their median voter,” he said.\n\nNot everyone agrees.\n\n“People across the political spectrum agree that in fact, the major crises and major problems facing the United States right now is not the existence and civic participation of trans people,” said Olivia Hunt, director of federal policy for Advocates for Trans Equality.\n\nAnd in the same election that saw Trump return to the presidency, Delaware voters elected Sarah McBride, the first transgender member of Congress.\n\nThe full political fallout remains to be seen\n\nPaisley Currah, a political science professor at the City University of New York, said conservatives go after transgender people in part because they make up such a small portion of the population.\n\n“Because it’s so small, it’s relatively unknown,” said Currah, who is transgender. “And then Trump has kind of used trans to signify what’s wrong with the left. You know: ‘It’s just too crazy. It’s too woke.’”\n\nBut Democratic politicians also know the population is relatively small, said Seth Masket, director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver, who is writing a book about the GOP.\n\n“A lot of Democrats are not particularly fired up to defend this group,” Masket said, citing polling.\n\nFor Republicans, the overall support of transgender rights is evidence they are out of step with the times.\n\n“The Democrat Party continues to find themselves on the wrong side of overwhelmingly popular issues, and it proves just how out of touch they are with Americans,” National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Mike Marinella said.\n\nSome of that message may be getting through.

And in his first months back in office, Trump has pushed the issue further, erasing mention of transgender people on government websites and passports and trying to remove them from the military.\n\nIt’s a contradiction of numbers that reveals a deep cultural divide: Transgender people make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, but they have become a major piece on the political chess board — particularly Trump’s.\n\nFor transgender people and their allies — along with several judges who have ruled against Trump in response to legal challenges — it’s a matter of civil rights for a small group. But many Americans believe those rights had grown too expansive.\n\nThe president’s spotlight is giving Monday’s Transgender Day of Visibility a different tenor this year.\n\n“What he wants is to scare us into being invisible again,” said Rachel Crandall Crocker, the executive director of Transgender Michigan who organized the first Day of Visibility 16 years ago. “We have to show him we won’t go back.”\n\nSo why has this small population found itself with such an outsized role in American politics?\n\nThe focus on transgender people is part of a long-running campaign\n\nTrump’s actions reflect a constellation of beliefs that transgender people are dangerous, are men trying to get access to women’s spaces or are pushed into gender changes that they will later regret.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and other major medical groups have said that gender-affirming treatments can be medically necessary and are supported by evidence.\n\nZein Murib, an associate professor of political science and women’s, gender and sexuality studies at Fordham University, said there has been a decades-old effort “to reinstate Christian nationalist principles as the law of the land” that increased its focus on transgender people after a 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling recognizing same-sex marriage nationwide. It took a few years, but some of the positions gained traction.\n\nOne factor: Proponents of the restrictions lean into broader questions of fairness and safety, which draw more public attention.\n\nSports bans and bathroom laws are linked to protecting spaces for women and girls, even as studies have found transgender women are far more likely to be victims of violence. Efforts to bar schools from encouraging gender transition are connected to protecting parental rights. And bans on gender-affirming care rely partly on the idea that people might later regret it, though studies have found that to be rare.\n\nSince 2020, about half the states passed laws barring transgender people from sports competitions aligning with their gender and have banned or restricted gender-affirming medical care for minors. At least 14 have adopted laws restricting which bathrooms transgender people can use in certain buildings.\n\nIn February, Iowa became the first state to remove protections for transgender people from civil rights law.\n\nIt’s not just political gamesmanship. “I think that whether or not that’s a politically viable strategy is second to the immediate impact that that is going to have on trans people,” Fordham’s Murib said.\n\nMany voters think transgender rights have gone too far\n\nMore than half of voters in the 2024 election — 55% — said support for transgender rights in the United States has gone too far, according to AP VoteCast. About 2 in 10 said the level of support has been about right, and a similar share said support hasn’t gone far enough.\n\nNevertheless, AP VoteCast also found voters were split on laws banning gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers or hormone therapy, for minors. Just over half were opposed to these laws, while just under half were in favor.\n\nTrump voters were overwhelmingly likely to say support for transgender rights has gone too far, while Kamala Harris’ voters were more divided. About 4 in 10 Harris voters said support for transgender rights has not gone far enough, while 36% said it’s been about right and about one-quarter said it’s gone too far.\n\nA survey this year from the Pew Research Center found Americans, including Democrats, have become more slightly more supportive of requiring transgender athletes to compete on teams that match their sex at birth and more supportive on bans on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors since 2022. Most Democrats still oppose those kinds of measures, though.\n\nLeor Sapir, a fellow at Manhattan Institute, a right-leaning think tank, says Trump’s and Republicans’ positions have given them a political edge.\n\n“They are putting their opponents, their Democratic opponents, in a very unfavorable position by having to decide between catering to their progressive, activist base or their median voter,” he said.\n\nNot everyone agrees.\n\n“People across the political spectrum agree that in fact, the major crises and major problems facing the United States right now is not the existence and civic participation of trans people,” said Olivia Hunt, director of federal policy for Advocates for Trans Equality.\n\nAnd in the same election that saw Trump return to the presidency, Delaware voters elected Sarah McBride, the first transgender member of Congress.\n\nThe full political fallout remains to be seen\n\nPaisley Currah, a political science professor at the City University of New York, said conservatives go after transgender people in part because they make up such a small portion of the population.\n\n“Because it’s so small, it’s relatively unknown,” said Currah, who is transgender. “And then Trump has kind of used trans to signify what’s wrong with the left. You know: ‘It’s just too crazy. It’s too woke.’”\n\nBut Democratic politicians also know the population is relatively small, said Seth Masket, director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver, who is writing a book about the GOP.\n\n“A lot of Democrats are not particularly fired up to defend this group,” Masket said, citing polling.\n\nFor Republicans, the overall support of transgender rights is evidence they are out of step with the times.\n\n“The Democrat Party continues to find themselves on the wrong side of overwhelmingly popular issues, and it proves just how out of touch they are with Americans,” National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Mike Marinella said.\n\nSome of that message may be getting through. In early March, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, launched his new podcast by speaking out against allowing transgender women and girls competing in women’s and girls sports.\n\nAnd several other Democratic officials have said the party spends too much effort supporting transgender rights.

Catherine Cortez Masto, have said they oppose transgender athletes in girls and women’s sports.\n\nJay Jones, the student government president at Howard University and a transgender woman, said her peers are largely accepting of transgender people.\n\n“The Trump administration is trying to weaponize people of the trans experience … to help give an archenemy or a scapegoat,” she said.

Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images President Donald Trump told an NBC interviewer on March 30, 2025, that he was “not joking” about a third term as president, despite such a term being barred by the Constitution. “There are methods which you could do it,” he said in the interview. For months, Trump has been hinting – in joking tones – that he’s interested in finding a way to continue in the White House past the legal limit of two terms. But the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution is clear that Trump can’t be elected again. The text of the amendment states: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.” That amendment was passed in response to Franklin Roosevelt’s four elections to the presidency. Since George Washington had stepped down at the end of his second term, no president had sought a third term, much less a fourth. The amendment was clearly meant to prevent presidents from serving more than two terms in office. Franklin D. Roosevelt delivers his fourth inaugural address on Jan. 20, 1945. Abbie Rowe, National Archives and Records Administration. Office of Presidential Libraries. Harry S. Truman Library, via Wikimedia Commons Because Trump has been elected president twice already, the plain language of the amendment bars him from being elected a third time. Some have argued that since Trump’s terms were nonconsecutive, the amendment doesn’t apply to him. But the amendment makes no distinction between consecutive and nonconsecutive terms in office. Though the 22nd Amendment prohibits Trump from being elected president again, it does not prohibit him from serving as president beyond Jan. 20, 2029. The reason for this is that the 22nd Amendment only prohibits someone from being “elected” more than twice. It says nothing about someone becoming president in some other way than being elected to the office. Skirting the rules There are a few potential alternate scenarios. Under normal circumstances, they would be next to impossible. But Donald Trump has never been a normal president. On issue after issue, Trump has pushed the outer limits of presidential power. Most importantly, he has already shown his willingness to bend or even break the law to stay in office. And while Trump claims he’s only joking when he floats the idea of a third term, he has a long history of using “jokes” as a way of floating trial balloons. Furthermore, once he leaves office, Trump could once again face the prospect of criminal prosecution and possibly jail time, further motivating him to stay in power. As Trump’s second term progresses, don’t be surprised if Americans hear more about how he might try to stay in office. Here is what the Constitution says about that prospect. Other ways to become president Nine people have served as president without first being elected to that office. John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Chester Arthur, Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford were all vice presidents who stepped into the office when their predecessors either died or resigned. The 22nd Amendment does not bar a term-limited president from being elected vice president. On the other hand, the 12th Amendment does state that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of the President shall be eligible to that of the Vice-President of the United States.” It’s not clear whether this restriction applies to a two-term president who is ineligible for a third term because of the 22nd Amendment – or whether it merely imposes on the vice president the Constitution’s other criteria for presidential eligibility, namely that they be a natural-born citizen of the United States, at least 35 years of age and have lived in the U.S. for at least 14 years. That question would have to be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. Should the justices decide in Trump’s favor – as they have recently on questions regarding the 14th Amendment’s insurrection clause and presidential immunity – then the 2024 ticket of Trump-Vance could become the 2028 Vance-Trump ticket. If elected, Vance could then resign, making Trump president again. No resignation needed But Vance would not even have to resign in order for a Vice President Trump to exercise the power of the presidency. The 25th Amendment to the Constitution states that if a president declares that “he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office … such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President.” In fact, the U.S. has had three such acting presidents – George H.W. Bush, Dick Cheney and Kamala Harris. All of them held presidential power for a brief period when the sitting president underwent anesthesia during medical procedures; Cheney did it twice. In this scenario, shortly after taking office on Jan. 20, 2029, President Vance could invoke the 25th Amendment by notifying the speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate that he is unable to discharge the duties of president. He would not need to give any reason or proof of this incapacity. Vice President Trump would then become acting president and assume the powers of the presidency until such time as President Vance issued a new notification indicating that he was able to resume his duties as president. ‘Tandemocracy’ But exercising the power of the presidency doesn’t even necessarily require being president or acting president. Trump has repeatedly expressed his admiration for autocratic Russian President Vladimir Putin, so he might want to follow the example of the Medvedev-Putin “tandemocracy.” Russian leaders Vladimir Putin, left, and Dmitry Medvedev have collaborated to hold power for more than a quarter-century, despite laws imposing term limits or other restrictions. Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images In 2008, term limits in the Russian constitution prevented Putin from running for president after two consecutive terms. Instead, he selected a loyal subordinate, Dmitry Medvedev, to run for president. When elected, Medvedev appointed Putin as his prime minister. By most accounts, Putin remained firmly in power and made most of the important decisions. Following this example, a future Republican president could appoint Trump to an executive branch position from which he could still exercise power. In 2012, Putin was able to run for president again, and he and Medvedev once again swapped roles. Since then, Putin has succeeded in amending the Russian Constitution to effectively allow him to remain president for the rest of his life. Using a figurehead Then again, Trump might just want to avoid all of these legal subterfuges by following the example of George and Lurleen Wallace. In 1966, the Alabama Constitution prevented Wallace from running for a third consecutive term as governor. Still immensely popular and unwilling to give up power, Wallace chose to have his wife, Lurleen, run for governor. It was clear from the beginning that Lurleen was just a figurehead for George, who promised to be an adviser to his wife, at a salary of $1 a year. The campaign’s slogan of “Two Governors, One Cause,” made it clear that a vote for Lurleen was really a vote for George. Lurleen won in a landslide. According to one account of her time in office, the Wallaces had “something of a Queen-Prime Minister relationship: Mrs. Wallace handles the ceremonial and formal duties of state. Mr. Wallace draws the grand outlines of state policy and sees that it is carried out.” Trump’s wife was not born a U.S. citizen and therefore isn’t eligible to be president. But as the head of the Republican Party, Trump could ensure that the next GOP presidential candidate was a member of his family or some other person who would be absolutely loyal and obedient to him. If that person went on to win the White House in 2028, Trump could serve as an unofficial adviser, allowing him to continue to wield the power of the presidency without the actual title.

We have a fight on our \n hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. \n Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates \n them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of \n our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.\n\nHelp us save her.\n\nA second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train. We have \n trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political \n spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily \n Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, \n Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a \n fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. \n And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible \n to ignore.\n\nWe can overcome the forces lined up against all of us.

The party must redefine its strategy, energize its base, and present a compelling vision for the future—before the damage becomes irreversible. \n\nThe silver lining is that 2025 should offer an opportunity for them to do just that.\n\nPolls indicate that President Donald Trump’s approval rating is falling, and Elon Musk’s plans to inflict lasting damage on the federal government are exceedingly unpopular with voters. \n\nAnd Trump’s inept Cabinet members are making careless, high-profile mistakes, like discussing battle strategies via an unsecured chat that mistakenly included a well-known reporter. These major errors provide Democrats with a critical chance to highlight the administration’s incompetence and reclaim political ground. \n\nAlready, Democrats are demonstrating some strength. On Tuesday, the party flipped a Pennsylvania state Senate seat in a solidly red area. How red? That district has never before elected a Democrat. \n\nIn other words, this district was not expected to be competitive—just like both of the congressional special elections in Florida taking place this Tuesday. Yet Republicans are feeling anxious. \n\nWinning Florida’s 1st District is almost certainly out of reach for Democrats. Trump carried it by 37 percentage points in November, according to NBC News. But Florida’s 6th District is slightly less red, having gone to Trump by 30 points, and Democrat Josh Weil has raised roughly $10 million in the race. The situation is serious enough that Musk, the Republican’s favorite sugar daddy, is stepping in to boost the GOP candidates in both districts.\n\nThe fact Musk is having to spend anything in these contests indicates that the GOP’s grip on power may be slipping loose even in conservative areas. Though Democrats are unlikely to win either Florida race, and special elections are not always indicative of how a party will perform in a midterm election, they can send a strong message to Republicans that the chaos Trump and Musk are unleashing on the federal government is hurting the party’s standing with voters. \n\nAnd it’s not only in Florida that Democrats could put on a showing. On the same day, a high-stakes and high-cost Supreme Court election will occur in Wisconsin—one that will determine whether liberals maintain their current 4-3 majority on the bench. \n\nLater in 2025, focus will shift to the gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia. Last year, in New Jersey, Trump ran only 6 points behind Democrat Kamala Harris—the closest a Republican presidential candidate has come to winning the state since 1992. And in Virginia, Democrats look to flip the mansion that Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin won in 2021 by a slim 2-point margin. (Youngkin is term-limited and cannot run again this year.)\n\nThese races will test whether Democrats can turn voter dissatisfaction with the Trump administration—and those associated with it—into electoral gains. \n\nBeyond the ballot box, Democrats have another opportunity to show their strength. The party would do well to continue promoting its most popular figures—leaders who can deliver a message that resonates across the political spectrum. Voices like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, or Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have the potential to energize voters and keep the party’s vision at the forefront. \n\nIn 2025, a year between major election cycles, Democrats have a vital chance to refine their messaging, spotlight Republican divides, and unify. Despite the GOP’s control of Washington, deep divisions still exist within that party. While the Signal controversy dominates headlines, another challenge is surfacing: passing Trump’s budget reconciliation bill. That bill will hold a lot of his administration’s awful priorities, and passing it will be fraught, opening rifts in the Republican coalition that Democrats should exploit.\n\nCritical elections are on the horizon, and the party must be prepared to seize them. Failing to do so would be—to quote Trump—a “bigly” missed opportunity.","summary":"Democrats are in an unenviable and precarious position. \n\n\n\nThey lost control of the White House and Senate last year.

Yet, while Parson’s election defeat was indeed an embarrassment, categorizing it as an indictment of Trump is an oversimplification.\n\nMalone took a victory lap with the media and deservedly so. However, he put the blame on Trump for his victory, claiming it was the so-called chaos from Trump’s administration that propelled him to victory. Malone benefited from Republican incompetence and complacency, as well as from the relative obscurity of the race being a special election that didn’t feature Trump’s name on the ballot.\n\n“He’s chosen to do it the way he does everything, right? Throw a brick in the basket and see what comes out,” he said. \n\nAn agenda-driven media tried to reinforce that narrative. Consider this article from the Associated Press, which quoted Malone and then claimed, “Voters backed that up.” The article then proceeded to quote just two people, both of whom I would wager have never supported or voted for Trump. However, this was purposely done to try to advance the narrative that Republicans are bleeding supporters because of Trump.\n\nWhile this was a typical left-wing Democrat response, it was also intellectually disingenuous and baseless. Trump won this district and the state in November. People voted for this so-called chaos. It’s what they wanted. Malone benefited from PA GOP incompetence, not because the majority of voters turned on Trump. There was significantly less turnout for the election (about half as many people voted than usual). Democrats capitalized on that and had a fluke election victory.\n\nWinning Pennsylvania state Senate District 36 is usually not a problem for Republicans, who typically win by a greater than 2-to-1 margin. However, the PA GOP does have a voter turnout problem when Trump is not running that it needs to address. It’s not an exaggeration to say that its entire system needs to be revamped.\n\nConsider the recent election results in the state.\n\nTrump was the first Republican candidate to win Pennsylvania since George H.W. Bush in 1988 when he defeated Hillary Clinton in a close election in 2016. He lost to Joe Biden in another close race in 2020 and then defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024. \n\nDave McCormick defeated Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in the 2024 Senate election by the slimmest of margins, less than .25% of the vote (and fewer than 16,000 votes). Before losing to McCormick, Casey had served as senator since 2006, when he soundly defeated Republican Sen. Rick Santorum. McCormick won because Trump was on the ballot, and he benefited from down-ballot voting. Otherwise, he would have lost. \n\nDemocratic Sen. John Fetterman was elected in 2022 without Trump on the ballot, defeating Dr. Mehmet Oz by nearly five percentage points. In 2016, Republican Sen. Pat Toomey was most likely headed for defeat against Democratic challenger Katie McGinty, whom Toomey beat by less than 1.5% points. Toomey was saved by Trump being on the ballot. \n\nTHE KATHERINE MAHER CASE FOR DEFUNDING NPR\n\nIn gubernatorial elections, the last Republican in office was Gov. Tom Corbett, who was the state’s governor from 2011 to 2015. \n\nIn 2024, Trump worked extensively to win Pennsylvania. He regularly held rallies across the state. His surrogates hosted numerous events to help drum up support and persuade voters. Multiple get-out-the-vote campaigns were created to help his campaign, contacting voters to inform them and remind them of the location where they were registered to vote.\n\nDuring one day in October, Trump, a 78-year-old man who survived an assassination attempt, worked at a McDonald’s in a Philadelphian suburb in the morning, held a rally in Lancaster in the afternoon, and attended an NFL game in Pittsburgh in the evening. \n\nDid the PA GOP even put nearly half the effort into helping Josh Parsons win Pennsylvania State Senate District 36? It does not appear so.\n\nAs a lifelong resident of the state and someone who lives about an hour from this district, I can confidently say it was more of a failure of the Pennsylvania GOP than a voter revolt against Trump. Pennsylvania Republicans did an exceptionally poor job at getting out the vote. Democrats were better organized and worked harder.\n\nMany Republicans were not even aware the election was happening. That’s an indictment on the PA GOP, not Trump. Unfortunately, the Pennsylvania Republican Party must learn how to get out voters and win high-stakes elections when Trump’s name is not on the ballot.","summary":"Democrats won a special election last week for a Pennsylvania state Senate race.

Thom Tillis, Susan Collins, Jon Husted, John Cornyn and Bill Cassidy could all face fierce fights to maintain their U.S. Senate seats next year. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) announced in January that Sen. Kristen Gillibrand, D-N.Y., will chair the DSCC with Sens. Mark Kelly, Adam Schiff and Lisa Blunt Rochester as vice chairs during the 2026 election cycle. The DSCC has not yet announced their target races for next year. \"Democrats have a Senate map that is ripe with offensive opportunities, particularly when coupled with the building midterm backlash against Republicans. Republicans have more seats to defend, and they’re doing it in a hostile political environment,\" DSCC Spokesman David Bergstein said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

'WE ARE BULLISH': HOUSE GOP TAKES AIM AT THESE 26 DEM SEATS IN MIDTERMS North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis was censured by the North Carolina Republican Party in 2023 for reportedly veering from Republican ideology on gun control policies, LGBTQ+ and immigrant rights. Tillis is considered a moderate Republican for his commitment to Ukraine funding, support for gun control legislation that expanded background checks and implemented red flag laws, voting to codify same-sex marriage and supporting legal pathways for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients. The bipartisan senator was first elected in 2014 and re-elected in 2020. He went against his more conservative colleagues by voting to certify former President Joe Biden's victory over Trump in 2020. Tillis has fallen in line with Republicans in 2025 by voting to confirm Trump's cabinet nominees, even as some expressed concern over his more controversial picks. However, that does not mean Tillis has been able to escape the ire of Trump's orbit. \"Thom Tillis is running 20 points behind DJT in North Carolina. We’re going to need a new senate candidate in NC unless we want to hand the gavel back to Schumer,\" a political advisor to Donald Trump Jr., Arthur Schwartz, said on X earlier this month. The Cook Political Report, a top nonpartisan political handicapper, rated Tillis' 2026 re-election bid as \"lean Republican.\" Maine Maine has long been a political outlier as one of only two states to split its electoral votes for the presidential election. Former Vice President Kamala Harris won Maine in 2024, but Trump still secured one electoral vote for winning Congressional District 2. Republican Sen. Susan Collins is considered another moderate Republican – which could serve her once again in the politically split state. Collins voted against the Senate confirmations of Trump's nominees for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and FBI Director Kash Patel. She has not shied away from criticizing Trump either, slamming his Jan. 6 pardons and proposed cuts to the National Institutes of Health grants. Collins has been a U.S. senator since 1996, surviving many primary and general election challenges from both sides of the political aisle. She became the first Republican woman to win a fifth term in the Senate in 2020. She is already facing two 2026 challengers – Democrat Natasha Alcala and Independent Phillip Rench. Maine's Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who sparred with Trump over transgender athletes playing in women's sports, has not ruled out a run for Collins' Senate seat. The Cook Political Report also rated Collins' race \"lean Republican.\" Ohio Ohio's Republican Sen. Jon Husted finds himself in a unique position heading into the 2026 midterms. He was appointed by Gov. Mike DeWine on Jan. 17, 2025 to fill the vacancy left by Vice President JD Vance. Husted is Ohio's former lieutenant governor. He also served as Ohio's secretary of state and as a state legislator. Because Husted was not elected U.S. senator, he will need to campaign in 2026 for the special election. If he wins, Husted will retain his seat and complete the remainder of Vance's term – through 2029. Rumors swirled that DeWine could choose Trump-ally Vivek Ramaswamy to replace Vance this year, but the moderate Republican governor ultimately chose his politically similar ally. Meanwhile, Ramaswamy has launched his own bid for Ohio governor. The race is rated \"likely Republican\" by The Cook Political Report. Texas Sen. John Cornyn has been the senator for Texas since 2002. While Cornyn is solidly conservative and has supported Trump, he has expressed private disagreement with the president on issues such as budget deficits and border security. Cornyn is already gearing up for tough potential primary challenges from Trump-ally Rep. Wesley Hunt and conservative Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Both Hunt and Paxton have not formally announced campaigns to primary the long-time Texas senator, but both candidates would set up a competitive race for Cornyn to keep his seat. The race is ranked \"solid Republican\" by The Cook Political Report with some GOP infighting expected if Hunt or Paxton announce Senate campaigns. Louisiana Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy is also expected to face a tough primary challenge in 2026. John Fleming, the Louisiana state treasurer and former representative, has declared a Senate bid. Rep. Clay Higgins, who was also expected to challenge Cassidy, announced on Thursday that he will not pursue a Senate campaign in 2026. Cassidy voted to convict Trump during his 2021 impeachment trial, alienating him from the Trump-loyalists of the party. The former physician raised concerns over Trump's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., during his confirmation hearing. While he ultimately voted to confirm Kennedy, Cassidy questioned Kennedy's vaccine skepticism as it conflicted with his own medical background. Cassidy has served in the Senate since 2015, after starting his political career in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Louisiana State Senate.

Is this correct? And if so, what is to be done about it? How can public opinion be harnessed to serve constitutional purposes in the new media landscape? How can and should the media system be reformed? And what can free speech law do about any of this?\n\nWe were all asked to write up to about 2000 words on our topics, and here was my submission.\n\nThe 2024 presidential campaign saw a massive disinformation and misinformation campaign, which likely helped bring the current administration into power. Leading media organizations failed to stop it in time. Indeed, some of them were complicit, through inadequate investigation and perhaps even willful blindness, in the misinformation. We thus face an urgent question, raised by the workshop organizers: \"How can and should the media system be reformed?\"\n\nI'm speaking, of course, of the campaign to conceal President Biden's mental decline—a campaign that was only conclusively exposed by the June 27, 2024 debate. At that point, little time was left for deciding whether the President should be persuaded to step aside; for the actual persuasion; for the selection of a replacement; and for the replacement's attempt to persuade the people to elect her.\n\nHad the Administration leveled with the public earlier, or had the media exposed the concealment earlier, there would likely have been time for a full primary campaign, in which Democratic voters could have made their choice about whom to run against Donald Trump.[1] Perhaps that candidate would have been more effective than Kamala Harris. Or perhaps the candidate would have still been Harris, but a Harris who was seen as having more legitimacy with the public. \"Democracy Dies in Darkness,\" the Washington Post tells us. It appears that the Democratic Party's prospects died in this particular darkness.\n\nThe single most consequential fact of the 2024 Presidential campaign had thus been largely hidden for a long time, including from (and, perhaps unwittingly, by) the media organizations whose job it is to inform us. Indeed, this a fact not just of immense political significance, but also central to national security: If President Biden was indeed cognitively impaired, that bore on his ability to make decisions as President, not just his ability to be re-elected.\n\nWhen, for instance, Trump and Vance spread unfounded rumors of Haitian immigrants eating cats and dogs, the media rightly blew the whistle. But when some media outlets tried to point out the evidence of Biden's likely incapacity, others didn't pick up on the investigation—and, indeed, sometimes pooh-poohed the investigation.\n\nAs late as mid-June 2024, the White House and many of its supporters characterized videos of Biden apparently freezing up and seeming confused as \"cheap fake\" disinformation created by his enemies.[2] Only Biden's televised debate performance on June 27, 2024 made it impossible to deny there was something badly wrong. It seems likely that many of the supposed \"cheap fakes\" actually accurately captured Biden's cognitive slippage, especially since the slippage apparently went back a good deal before the debate.[3] And even if some particular videos had indeed been disinformation from his enemies, the fact remains that the media failed to adequately identify the disinformation from his friends. Indeed, isn't it shocking that so many White House reporters appear to have learned thanks only to the nationally televised debate and not to their investigative journalism?\n\nOf course, reaching the truth on this question wasn't easy. Biden insiders apparently tried hard to conceal the facts (that's the disinformation part). And indeed it's not surprising that people who are both personally loyal to a President and rely on the President's success for their ongoing careers would want to conceal such facts. In our fallen world, we can't expect much candor from political insiders. And I expect most journalists sincerely believed the reassurances they were getting from the insiders.\n\nBut getting sincerely duped isn't a great professional mark for a journalist. Their job was to dig and find out—before things became evident, not after. Indeed, to the extent that the media's credibility has declined over recent years, such failures of investigation seem likely to only exacerbate this decline.\n\nUndoubtedly, the White House wanted to keep this fact [of Biden's decline] under wraps until Biden was safely over the finish line in November. But media organizations that participated, even unwittingly, in this farce have not only made a subsequent Democratic administration far less likely—they have profoundly undermined their own integrity.[4]\n\nHow could this happen? I hope we will learn more about this in the years to come. A CNN headline the day I write this, discusses a forthcoming book by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson called \"Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.\"\n\nBut at this point, at least a first cut—informed by our shared knowledge of human nature—is that many in the media likely didn't dig hard because they didn't really wanted to uncover things. It isn't controversial, I think, that most in the mainstream media much preferred President Biden over his challenger, Donald Trump.[5] Indeed, I agree they had good reason to dislike Trump. Certainly Trump himself had done much to stoke that hostility.\n\n\"Biden is cognitively impaired\" was a standard talking point on the Right. So long as Biden was the nominee, that fact, if demonstrated, would help Trump. (As I've argued, if the fact helped Democrats replace Biden with a better candidate, it might have hurt Trump, but that would have been a less direct chain of causation.) It's human nature to accept stories that fit one's political preferences than to challenge them. A thought experiment: If the sitting President in 2024 had been a Republican—whether Trump or, say, an older Ron DeSantis—would the media have acted the same way they did? Or would they have worked harder, dug deeper, and uncovered the truth earlier?\n\nYet of course institutions should be designed to counteract the flaws generated by human nature while working within the constraints created by human nature. (That knowledge was old when Madison was young.) This is true of media institutions as well as governmental ones. There need to be mechanisms to keep reporters' and editors' inevitable ideological predilections from turning into ideological blinders and ideological blunders.\n\nOf course, it's much easier to identify the problem than a suitable solution. One can imagine, for instance, newspapers deliberately seeking out reporters and editors with many different ideological beliefs, hoping that colleagues will fill each others' blind spots (or, in collegial conversations, help each other identify their blind spots). But this may be hard to implement; and, as with preferences based on race and sex, preferences based on politics may be challenged as leading to hiring based on ideology rather than merit. (They may also be defended, as with preferences based on race and sex, as a tool for fighting subconscious bias that keeps meritorious candidates from being fairly considered.) Indeed, hiring that considers applicants' ideological beliefs may violate some states' laws that limit employment discrimination based on political ideology or party affiliation,[6] just as hiring that considers applicants' religious beliefs may violate bans on employment discrimination based on religion.\n\nNewspapers might also return to prohibiting reporters and editors from publicly opining on controversial issues. Of course, realistic readers will recognize that reporters may still be biased. But taking a public stand on an issue may increase such bias: If one has publicly endorsed position X, it might become harder to write fairly about evidence that instead tends to support the rival position Y. Few of us like writing something that suggests that we were mistaken in the past, or that our critics can interpret as making such a suggestion.\n\nAgain, though, in some jurisdictions such public neutrality rules for newspaper employees may violate state employment statutes. One state court held (by a 5–4 vote) that those statutes themselves violate the First Amendment when applied to newspaper reporters or editors.[7] But in AP v. NLRB (1937), the U.S. Supreme Court held (also 5–4) that federal labor law, which bans discrimination based on union membership, didn't violate the Associated Press's rights to select reporters or editors.\n\nLikewise, one can imagine newspapers and magazines deliberately courting a broad ideological mix of readers—not just for the extra revenue, but also to commit themselves to having a base that they will need to be seen as treating fairly. A publication that has many readers on the left, right, and center might feel more pressure to be fair and careful to all sides. Of course, it may be hard these days to acquire such a broad reader base. And there's always the danger that concern about reader reactions may press a newspaper to avoid controversial topics altogether, rather than to try handling them fairly.\n\nFinally, newspapers can just try to recommit themselves to objectivity, fuzzy as the term may sometimes be. (Many commentators have expressly taken the opposite view.[8]) In their news coverage, they may recommit to discussing the best arguments on both sides of contested issues. In choosing what to cover, they may try hard to see what both sides of the aisle view as especially important. On their editorial pages, they may avoid a party line, either instituted top down[9] or by staff revolts.[10] Instead, they may adopt the policy that whatever ideas are shared by at least substantial minorities of the public should be seriously covered, even when editors think that one side is obviously wrong.\n\nAgain, though, that's easier said than done (and it's not even that easily said). It will inevitably require hard choices that will leave many observers skeptical about the media organization's fairness —e.g., which sides of a multi-sided issue should be covered, which topics are important enough to cover, which positions are such outliers that they can be set aside, how to allocate scarce space and attention. And it may not do much to solve the problem we began with, which is the ability of media organizations to be massively duped by the side they sympathize with.\n\nThus, these solutions are likely to be far from perfect. The cures may even be worse than disease.\n\nBut there is indeed a disease, \"a profoundly broken media system\" (to quote the workshop organizers). This system is one that the public has good reason to distrust. Its flaws undermine the media's ability to check government malfeasance. It may have been so captured by the desire to #Resist one movement that it failed to resist the disinformation spread by another. And it may thus have ended up helping the very candidate and movement that it had (understandably) viewed as dangerous.\n\n[1] See, e.g., Josh Barro, This Is All Biden's Fault, N.Y.

And while Biden raised tariffs in 2024, inflation still started to decline – just as it remained flat after Trump tariffed Chinese imports worth $350 billion starting in 2018.\n\nBiden’s combination of tariffs and industrial policies to boost demand for domestic goods and incentivize investment delivered the manufacturing boom that Trump keeps promising. By 2023, the United States had the highest rate of investment in factories in 30 years.\n\nPerversely, instead of trumpeting this achievement, the Democrats’ 2024 presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, attacked “Trump’s tariffs” in a campaign that lost a majority of working-class voters.\n\nNow, instead of attacking Trump’s misguided notion that tariffs alone can revive American manufacturing, and highlighting his plan to kill the industrial policies that will deliver new manufacturing jobs (for which Trump will claim credit), Democrats have doubled down.\n\nBranding tariffs as Trumpian is a mistake. If you support a carbon border tax to combat climate change, or enforcement of labor standards in trade pacts, you support tariffs. And tariffs are popular. Shortly before the US presidential election, 56% of Americans favored increasing tariffs, with support among non-college-educated voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Ohio at 58%.\n\nThe economic damage Trump has caused since taking office in January is not due to tariffs per se, but the economic uncertainty caused by constant tariff changes and targeting of non-trade-related goals, like migration and fentanyl trafficking, and countries like Canada (with which the US has a non-oil trade surplus).\n\nRiding Trump’s tariff rollercoaster, prospective US manufacturing investors are more likely to reach for a barf bag than their checkbooks.\n\nEven so, a March CBS poll found Americans still wanted higher tariffs against China. Are they wrong? Core elements of the postwar Bretton Woods system are either incompatible with today’s realities or have been entirely eliminated, like fixed exchange rates.\n\nThe US dollar, as the world’s main reserve currency, does not depreciate to correct trade imbalances. A chronically overvalued dollar means that imported goods denominated in other currencies crush even the most efficient US producers.\n\nMeanwhile, decades of liberalization of capital flows, together with powerfully enforced foreign-investor rights, have led to offshoring of even high-end manufacturing to low-wage countries.\n\nThe result has been a persistent US global trade deficit since 1975, including a record-high $918.4 billion in 2024. As economic theory would predict, deindustrialization and greater economic inequality followed.\n\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement and the emergence of the World Trade Organization in the mid-1990s, together with China’s accession to the WTO in 2001, turned the gradual decline of US manufacturing capacity since the early 1980s into a rout.\n\nThe US has since lost more than 90,000 factories and five million net manufacturing jobs and now mainly produces dollar-denominated assets purchased by foreigners with the billions of dollars they earn by selling Americans their goods.\n\nThis has been extremely profitable for the US economy’s financialized sectors and wealthy investors – and a disaster for many.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves. Sixty-three percent of Americans could not cover a $500 emergency expense. Those with college degrees live a whopping eight years longer than those without, while so-called deaths of despair among working-age Americans – from suicide, alcohol-related diseases, and drugs – decreased overall US life expectancy for the first time starting in 2015. Former factory towns nationwide, not only in the Rust Belt, have been shattered.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. The COVID-19 crisis demonstrated the perils of having production of many essential goods concentrated in too few countries, which US military analysts also consider a national security risk.\n\nThe US can create good jobs and restore a sense of security for the 62% of American workers without college degrees by boosting domestic production of products essential to Americans’ health, safety, and security. This, and diversifying the sources of US imports, can strengthen US national resilience and security.\n\nTariffs will be part of the fix because the problem is on the import side. America cannot export its way to balance. While the US has by far the largest chronic trade deficit, 66 countries are in the same position, while 19 countries, including China, Germany, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, rack up chronic global trade surpluses by relying on mercantilist policies to boost their manufacturing capacity and exports.\n\nDecades of anti-dumping, subsidies, and WTO enforcement cases have not stopped this. If deficit countries united to raise tariffs on surplus countries, it would not only help rebalance trade but also benefit their workers, who would become the consumers of the goods no longer flooding export markets.\n\nIf that bloc of countries also agreed to act in accordance with the International Labor Organization’s core standards and the rules of key multilateral environmental treaties, even more people could benefit from trade.\n\nAs offshoring has moved into higher-wage work, the main premise of free trade gains – that even if some people lose their jobs, everyone benefits from access to cheaper imported goods – has collapsed. As Nobel laureate economist Paul Samuelson showed in 2004, US workers now lose more in wages than they gain from cheap imports.\n\nTariffs are not the panacea Trump claims, but they also do not always raise consumer prices. Tariffs are charged on the wholesale price of imported goods. Whether these costs are passed on to consumers is a choice made by companies that import tariffed goods. A National Bureau of Economic Research study showed few retail-price increases after the 2018 China tariffs, because companies absorbed the cost from their profit margins instead.\n\nOn the other hand, some firms use tariffs as cover to increase their margins. For example, while Trump’s first-term tariffs supposedly raised prices for washers and dryers, there were no tariffs on dryers, and retailers raised washer prices in Canada, where no tariffs applied. Strong enforcement of competition policy can combat price increases during the necessary transition to more balanced trade.\n\nTo reap the benefits of trade, it is critical that the US cut its large chronic trade deficit. Trump’s focus on “reciprocal tariffs,” rather than balanced trade, does not suggest an intention to use tariffs strategically to achieve this.\n\nBut Democrats must stop dismissing outright a policy tool that they themselves embraced under Biden. The question they should focus on is whether Trump’s tariffs will help or hurt Americans.\n\nLori Wallach is Director of the Rethink Trade program at the American Economic Liberties Project.","summary":"By Lori WALLACH As the clock ticks down to President Donald Trump’s planned imposition of “reciprocal tariffs” on US trade partners on April 2, Trump’s opponents have been attacking tariffs as a price-raising menace, rather than indicting Trump’s two-month master class on how to misuse a potentially effective policy tool.

Any positive results from Tuesday would not only give Democrats a much-needed boost but could also have implications for control of the House, where Republicans hold a narrow 218-213 majority.What To KnowTwo special elections will take place Tuesday in heavily Republican areas of Florida. In the 1st District, Republican candidate, Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, is facing off against Democratic hopeful Gay Valimont. The seat was previously held by former Representative Matt Gaetz, who left after originally being tapped as President Donald Trump's pick for attorney general.Also on Tuesday, Republican Florida state Senator Randy Fine and Democrat Josh Weil will compete for the seat in the 6th District. That seat was formerly held by Michael Waltz, who resigned to become Trump's national security adviser.Both Republican candidates are favored to retain their seats. Waltz won reelection in November 2024 by 33 points, with Trump defeating then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the district by 30 points. Gaetz was reelected with 66 percent of the vote, and Trump won the district with 68 percent.Enten noted Sunday that the face-off between Fine and Weil could be \"far more competitive\" than the 2024 results would suggest.Early and mail-in voting data shows Fine with a 9-point lead over Weil—down significantly from Waltz's 33-point margin nearly five months ago.Enten said that, if the numbers hold, this could still be a positive sign for Democrats. He added that, in the past five midterm cycles, the party that overperformed in special elections went on to win the House.Several Republicans, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and War Room host Steve Bannon, have expressed concern about Fine's campaign, fearing he may underperform Tuesday.At a recent press conference, DeSantis said, if the Trump-endorsed Fine fails to achieve something like a 30-point victory margin, it would be a \"candidate-specific issue\" rather than a reflection of voter backlash against Trump or the GOP.Weil has also significantly outspent Fine during the campaign. Weil reportedly raised $10 million for his congressional bid, while Fine raised less than $1 million between November 26 and March 3. Heading into the April 1 election, Weil had more than $1.2 million in cash on hand compared to Fine's $92,600.What People Are SayingCNN chief political data analyst Harry Enten said: \"If you look right now at the early vote plus the mail vote [for the 6th District special election], and we believe that will make up the majority of the vote based on history, the GOP edge in terms of party registration is just nine points. So there's this idea that this race may, in fact, be far more competitive than the 2024 baseline would suggest.\"If we look so far at the average special election—there have only been really state legislative ones—Democrats are doing about nine points better, on average, than Kamala Harris did. Now you might say, 'OK, who cares?' and so forth. But here's why that's important: Going all the way back to the 2005—2006 cycle, when one party outperforms in special elections, guess how many times they've gone on to win the U.S. House? Five out of five.\"So the fact that Democrats have been outperforming so far is a good sign for them heading into 2026. In fact, if they're able to outperform in Florida again on Tuesday, that would just build the blocks that suggest, 'You know what? We can't win in the 6th District, but that district is so far to the right. All of a sudden, we get more toward the center of the electorate—we may be able to pick up seats that Trump won by five points, even if we can't pick up seats Trump won by 30, like the 6th District.'\"Scott Tranter, director of data science at Decision Desk HQ, told The Hill: \"Given GOP voters tend to turn out more on Election Day, we expect the electorate to settle in the R+14 range once all the [6th District] votes are counted Tuesday. All that being said, we have seen special elections recently where the Democratic candidate has overcome R+15 electorates. That's why this race remains close in a district President Trump won handily in 2024.\"Randy Fine campaign spokesperson Bryan Piligra previously told Newsweek: \"When Randy is victorious on April 1, it will be because of the strength of the Trump agenda and the faith the American people have in him. Randy is grateful for the president's unwavering confidence in him. The voters of CD 6 know they can count on Randy to fight fiercely alongside President Trump to Make America Great Again.\"Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried previously told Newsweek: \"The Florida Democratic Party is fully mobilized to get out the vote in CD 1 and CD 6, where our volunteers on the phones and at the doors are seeing unprecedented enthusiasm for Democratic candidates in these deep-red districts.\"Right now, Democrats and Republicans are neck and neck in vote-by-mail returns in CD 6, and the latest polls show this race is within the margin of error. Randy Fine thought he could cruise to victory as Trump's hand-picked candidate and walk into office without a fight.

Yet social media seemed to ooze with enthusiasm and Gen Z-friendly hipster appeal. \n\nHarris, a career politician favored by the Democratic Party’s establishment, never quite fit the bill as an icon of activist movements. But the sudden influencer buzz seemed to transform the stodgy former prosecutor into an icon of the cultural zeitgeist. \n\nAs it turns out, the tidal wave of enthusiasm was not entirely genuine. Much of the content, including Montooth’s videos, was quietly funded by an elusive group of Democratic billionaires and major donors in an arrangement designed to conceal the payments from voters. RealClearInvestigations obtained internal documents and WhatsApp messages from Democratic strategists behind the influencer campaign. Way to Win, one of the major donor groups behind the effort, spent more than $9.1 million on social media influencers during the 2024 presidential election – payments revealed here for the first time. The amount was touted in a document circulated after the election detailing the organization’s accomplishments. \n\nThe effort supported over 550 content creators who published 6,644 posts across platforms, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitch, and X. Way to Win coached creators on phrases, issue areas, and key themes to “disseminate pro-Kamala content throughout the cycle,” a post-election memo from the group noted.\n\nThe look behind the curtain reveals that at least some of the image-making around the Harris candidacy was carefully orchestrated by the same types of covert social media marketing often used by corporate brands and special interest groups. Such campaigns provide the illusion of organic support through the authentic appeal of trusted social media voices.Way to Win, in internal messages, touted its work with a stable of Democratic Party-affiliated influencers and activists, including Harry Sisson, Emily Amick, Kate Abu, and Dash Dobrofsky. The group also overtly cultivated “non-political creators” – influencers typically known for travel vlogs, comedic skits, or cooking recipes – and seeded them with “positive, specific pro-Kamala content” that was “integral in setting the tone on the Internet and driving additional organic digital support.” The effort often took the form of talking points that were rapidly distributed to the in-network creators. \n\n“Bro who is Tim Walz,” said @AbeeTheArtist, one of the TikTok creators backed by Way to Win. “He's a football coach, that's hard,” the influencer continued. “It's time for Republicans to drop out, it's not looking good for ya'll!”In a series of internal presentations about the influencer campaign, Way to Win emphasized its data-driven approach. \"We know what messaging works,\" noted Liz Jaff, a branding strategist working with Way to Win, during a call with donors last year. She touted the use of an AI-based focus group tool developed by Future Forward, the Harris campaign’s primary SuperPAC. Jaff also explained the process for developing talking points that could be inserted into organic-appearing messages and posts on social media. “We then convey that to the influencers who take that into their own words,” continued Jaff. “We then test those videos and see what needs to be boosted,” she added, referencing paid media efforts to amplify specific TikTok videos or favored streamers. The lofty promises of message mastery, however, often fell short. Way to Win directly financed a series of clunky YouTube shows and liberal identity politics-oriented social media skits designed to bring voters out to support the Harris campaign and Democrats more broadly. There’s little evidence that such measures moved any significant numbers of voters during an election in which Democrats lost historic levels of support from key constituency groups – the youth vote, Latinos, and black men swung significantly to Donald Trump last year, upending decades of voting patterns.\n\nIlana Glazer, a comedian who starred in the Comedy Central show Broad City, received Way to Win funding for a series of election videos called “Microdosing Democracy,” in which she half-heartedly endorsed Harris as she lighted a spliff of marijuana. Another TikTok and Instagram series backed by the donors, called “Gaydar,” featured interviews quizzing people on the streets of New York City about gay culture trivia with little election-related content.\n\nWay to Win also funded a caravan with an inflatable IUD to Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Raleigh, St. Louis, and other locations. The tour, which featured content creators producing posts along the way, was designed to bring attention to claims that Trump would ban contraceptive devices. \n\nIn an apparent attempt to boost Harris’ support among black men, Way to Win directly funded a series of YouTube interview-style talk shows called Watering Hole Media.\n\n\"I heard a brother say to me, 'Man, I didn't know I was going to be excited when Kamala was selected,’\" said Jeff Johnson, a managing director with the lobbying firm Actum LLC who worked as a host for the Watering Hole Mediaseries “Tap In.” “One brother said, 'I'm not even fully sure why,’” continued Johnson. “No, seriously, he said, 'When I look at her, though, she reminds me of my aunt,' and I said yes, so there is this communal piece.\" The discussion, taped at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last August, buzzed about the “through line” from the Black Panthers to the Nation of Islam to Harris' nomination, suggesting her candidacy represented another moment in radical black politics. The Way to Win-sponsored media group sponsored many similar discussions attempting to buoy the Harris candidacy with appeals to racial identity politics.Despite the well-funded efforts, few tuned in. The seven video programs produced at the DNC collectively garnered fewer than 1,000 views. One video had fewer than 40 viewers. \n\nQuestions have mounted over the campaign spending decisions from Harris and her supporting organizations. The Harris campaign and her SuperPAC spent over $1.5 billion in the last months of the campaign, with much of the money flowing to consultants and media advertising. Alex Cooper, who hosted Harris for an interview on her “Call Her Daddy” podcast, was baffled about why the campaign spent about $100,000 on a “cardboard” temporary studio set that “wasn’t that nice.” Others have raised similar concerns about payments to Oprah Winfrey’s production firm. \n\n“Our 2024 creator program reached key audiences with nearly a billion views, but there’s more to do, and we’re applying lessons from last cycle,” a Way to Win spokesperson said in a statement to RCI.\n\n\"Sometimes in presidential campaigns, there are times when there aren't any cost controls,\" observed Mike Mikus, a Democratic strategist in Pennsylvania. \"The biggest question is whether they had any empirical evidence that this TikTok messaging would work.\"The payments occupy a hazy area of election law. Way to Win structured the funds through nonprofit corporations that paid various influencer talent agencies – firms such as Palette Management and Vocal Media. The money was not listed in Federal Election Commission disclosure portals that show political funds spent during the campaign. While television or radio ads require disclaimers showing the groups responsible for paying for the advertisements, there are no equivalent mandates for TikTok stars or Instagram personalities that receive payment to promote election-related content. Despite some attempts to reform election transparency regulations, minimal progress has been made. The FEC has deadlocked over attempts to form new rules to govern the influencer space, leaving the entire medium virtually lawless regarding campaign cash. Way to Win operates several entities and corporations, most of which do not disclose donors. The group did not respond to a request for comment for more information in this regard. However, the cache of documents about the influencer campaign pointed to some clues. Way to Win hosted a series of donor-only events in San Francisco and Washington, D.C., with representatives of the Open Society Foundation, the charity backed by billionaire investor George Soros. OSF did not respond to a request for comment. \n\nDemocrats are hardly alone in payola for influencers. Republican campaigns have spent several hundred thousand dollars on similar social media marketing agencies that tout the ability to seed content with popular accounts on X and TikTok. \n\nBut the attempted reach and spending of the pro-Kamala Harris 2024 effort is unprecedented. For Way to Win, the group justified the spending sprees as the only way to compete with pro-Trump voices and popular podcasts, such as Joe Rogan, which the Harris campaign eschewed. \n\n“Our goal this year was to combat conservative content domination on Instagram and TikTok. We did that,” Way to Win claimed in a triumphant memo to donors after the election. “Had more Americans gotten their media from Instagram and TikTok,” the December memo argued, “Kamala Harris would be the next President of the United States.”","summary":"By Lee Fang, RealClearInvestigations and LeeFang.comMarch 31, 2025The abrupt withdrawal last year of President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee, followed rapidly by his replacement wi","url":"https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2025/03/31/revealed_pro-kamala_social-media_millions_that_couldnt_make_brat_rhyme_with_democrat_1100324.html","image":"https://assets.realclear.com/images/68/682170_6_.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-31 11:36:36","author":"Lee Fang,RCI & LeeFang.com","authors":["Lee Fang","RCI & LeeFang.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.033},{"id":306058444,"title":"Stephen A.

It stressed that the new anti-discrimination policy encompasses much more than the race-conscious admissions programs recently declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court (forty-five years after the Court declared them constitutional).\n“Educational institutions may neither separate or segregate students based on race,” the letter said. For example, programs that suggest “certain racial groups bear unique moral burdens that others do not” violated the equal-protection clause, since they “stigmatize students who belong to particular racial groups based on crude racial stereotypes. Consequently, they deny students the ability to participate fully in the life of a school.” (Whether a majority group can discriminate against itself—who is stereotyping whom?—is an interesting question not explored in the letter.)\nAlthough some school policies “may appear neutral on their face,” the letter cautioned, “a closer look reveals that they are, in fact, motivated by racial considerations.” Eliminating standardized testing, for instance, could be a covert means of achieving racial balance or “diversity,” and thus a denial of equal protection. The letter cites the 1977 Supreme Court case of Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corporation as a supporting authority for this interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nIf the Administration were not using this kind of fake (to borrow a term) legalism as an excuse to take a hammer to higher education, the letter might be funny. Student ethnic-affinity groups, a standard feature of campus life for decades, could now be seen as racially discriminatory. And is the Fourteenth Amendment to be used to restrict speech? If Donald Trump can say that an airplane crash was caused by diversity hiring, I can say that certain groups bear unique moral burdens. We might both be wrong, but our speech is protected by the First Amendment. (A related executive order posted by the White House did note free-speech exceptions.) Most risible is the citation of Arlington Heights. That case does not stand for the principle that ostensibly race-neutral policies may violate equal protection. It stands for the opposite principle.\nThe case involved the denial of a rezoning request to build multifamily dwellings in the upscale Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights. Sixty-four thousand people lived in the suburb; twenty-seven (not twenty-seven thousand, just twenty-seven) of them were Black. A development company that wanted to build housing for low- and moderate-income families sued, claiming that the denial perpetuated racial segregation and was therefore in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection.\nThe Supreme Court, in an opinion by Lewis Powell, held that even if it could be shown that the failure to rezone made it harder for nonwhites to move to Arlington Heights—that is, even if it had a racially disparate impact—the plaintiffs would have to prove that it was adopted with discriminatory intent, which they had failed to do. No intention to discriminate, no discrimination.\nThe citation of Arlington Heights in the Department of Education letter inadvertently makes clear the astonishing transformation in constitutional jurisprudence that is now under way in this country. Ever since the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, in 1868, courts have made it challenging for Black people—the people everyone agrees the amendment was specifically designed to protect—to prevail in equal-protection cases. Even when laws were plainly discriminatory, as with Jim Crow, courts mostly declined to strike them down, reasoning that “separate” was not inconsistent with “equal.” The intent standard in Arlington Heights was another way of making it harder to prove a claim of racial discrimination. That a government policy made nonwhites worse off relative to whites was not enough to show a denial of equal protection.\nThe letter from the Department of Education also warned against the use of proxies for race and other “less direct, but equally insidious, ways” of practicing discrimination. But states and municipalities have often used proxies for race, such as income or party affiliation, to engineer discriminatory outcomes—for example, when drawing congressional redistricting maps. And government actions that can be made to seem only remotely related to discriminatory behavior—for example, awarding a liquor license to a private club that does not serve Black people—are not outlawed as a “covert” means of discrimination.\nIn short, after more than a century during which the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was construed narrowly when nonwhites claimed to be victims of discrimination, the Administration proposes to expand the amendment’s scope when white people believe themselves to be the victims. Still, in the law, one size fits all. What lowers the bar for whites should lower the bar for every other group. I’m not sure the acting Secretary has thought that part through.\nThe letter repeats the familiar charge that “educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism.’ ” Putting aside the toxicity part, I think that this idea is the heart of the issue.\nYou can look at it this way. People living in Arlington Heights wanted to maintain property values. Maintaining property values meant zoning for single-family residences. Single-family residences were more likely to be affordable to white home buyers than to nonwhite home buyers (in part because the latter were more likely to have trouble getting a mortgage). So having single-family zoning kept Arlington Heights predominantly white. And, since homeownership is generational wealth—houses can be inherited—racial disparities get locked in.\nToday, a little under seventy-five thousand people live in Arlington Heights; only three per cent of them are Black. (The city of Chicago, less than twenty-five miles away, is twenty-eight per cent Black.) In this line of reasoning, no white homeowner had to think, I don’t want to live around Black people. The thought could be more like I want to protect the value of my home equity so that I can pass it along to my heirs.\nBut disparity in homeownership is a big reason that, according to the Census Bureau, the average white household possesses ten times as much wealth as the average Black household. And homeownership is one piece in the standard American Dream pile of assets. As Lyndon Johnson put it in a message to Congress in 1966, “Employment is often dependent on education, education on neighborhood schools and housing, housing on income, and income on employment.”\nThis is structural racism: the system is not self-correcting. Government has to intervene to break the cycle, and that is something that government has found it hard to do, even when the political winds were blowing in a direction favorable to civil rights.\nAdams, a Detroit native who teaches law at the University of Michigan, does not propose a new understanding of the facts or the law, but her book is passionate and well researched. It can also get a little in the weeds. The trial alone lasted forty-one days, and there is a sizable cast of characters. We get a full appreciation for the complexities of the campaign for racial justice from the book.\nThe Bradley in Milliken v. Bradley was a six-year-old named Ronald. Ronald was a student at Clinton Elementary School, in northwest Detroit. His mother, Verda, served as a lunchroom aide there, and she could see that the school was suffering from underfunding and neglect. Classes, which might have as many as fifty students, sometimes had to be held in trailers, owing to a shortage of space. When it snowed, the city didn’t bother to plow the schoolyard. It just threw some cinders on it.\nVerda Bradley didn’t think that the reason for the neglect was mysterious. Ninety-seven per cent of the students at Clinton were Black. She believed that, if it were fully integrated, services would improve, and so would the quality of Ronald’s education. She was from Tennessee, a Jim Crow state. She had come to Detroit in 1942, as part of the Second Great Migration. When she arrived, the city was about nine per cent Black. By 1970, the year of the lawsuit, it was 43.7 per cent Black. Whites were moving to the suburbs, a trend that started after the war but was accelerated by urban unrest in the summer of 1967, during which at least forty-three people died and more than seven thousand were arrested.\nLike many Black parents in the post-Brown v. Board of Education era, Verda was not interested in integration for its own sake. She simply believed that a school with a lot of white kids was going to get more resources than a school in which almost all the kids were Black. So she approached the local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., which, in 1970, filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court. The defendant, William Milliken, was the Republican governor of Michigan.\nThe history of school desegregation—the history of Brown after Brown—is well known. After the decision came down, in 1954, Thurgood Marshall, who had argued the case before the Court, predicted that public schools would be integrated in five years and all of American society would be integrated in nine.\nThings didn’t quite work out that way. In 1955, in a case known as Brown II, the Court ordered school systems to desegregate “with all deliberate speed,” a phrase that Marshall said would be interpreted as “S-L-O-W.” Slow turned out to be an understatement. Southern states resisted desegregating their public schools for years. In 1963, the year John F. Kennedy proposed a civil-rights bill, only two per cent of Southern Black children were attending schools with whites.\nThat started to change when the Justice Department and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare began putting pressure on school districts to desegregate. Finally, in 1968, the Supreme Court put its foot down. In Green v. County School Board of New Kent County, it charged school boards that once operated a dual system with “the affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch.” A year later, in Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, the Court said that school desegregation must happen “at once.” The era of all deliberate speed was over.\n“Root and branch” is a reference to systemic racism. The Court was saying that it was not enough to have mixed-race classrooms. Sending small numbers of Black children into schools with overwhelmingly white student bodies and virtually no Black adults in the building had been a disaster. The lesson was that, for integration to work in the way the Court had imagined with Brown, the whole system needed to be desegregated. The Court’s order in Green therefore extended to “every facet of school operations—faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities and facilities.”\nIn 1968, then, the federal government finally seemed ready to make good on the vision of Brown: integrated schools as a step toward a post-racial society. The plaintiffs in the Milliken case had reason to believe that they might prevail.\nThe other problem was that, because of the racial imbalance in the city, no integration plan could be effective unless it included the suburbs, where the residents and the schools were virtually all white. What was needed, therefore, was an interdistrict, or “metropolitan,” remedy. In order to get a court to endorse this solution, the plaintiffs had to show that what looked like de-facto segregation, just the pattern resulting from personal housing choices, was a result of state action.\nThe N.A.A.C.P. amassed an impressive amount of evidence, which it used to convince the district-court judge Stephen Roth, who initially seemed unsympathetic, that school segregation was the result of government and not just real-estate-industry policies. The evidence showed that the Detroit school board had made decisions about districting, sites of new school construction, feeder schools, and school transportation with a view to maintaining a racially segregated system.\nHousing patterns, too, were the result of discriminatory actions whose effects had compounded over decades. Government decisions about the location of public-housing and urban-renewal projects had been guided by racial considerations. Redlining practices used by the Federal Housing Administration and the federally funded Home Owners’ Loan Corporation had made it almost impossible for Black people to get mortgages. By mid-century, more than eighty per cent of the properties outside central Detroit had racial covenants—which were generally clauses in deeds signed by white homeowners pledging not to sell or rent to Black people.\nIn addition, the National Association of Real Estate Boards’ “Code of Ethics,” adopted in 1924, specified that “a Realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy, members of any race, or nationality or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that neighborhood.” (The explicit reference to race was eliminated from the code in the fifties.) Black real-estate agents in Detroit did not have access to white agents’ listings of homes. Presiding over all this was the state government, whose constitutional duty it was to provide for the equal protection of its citizens.\nThere was a ton of evidence, but it was agreed that the most powerful witness for the plaintiffs was a ten-by-twenty-foot map of the city that showed the evolution of residential segregation. The map was placed, for the duration of the trial, in the judge’s line of vision, a constant reminder of racial separation. At one point, Roth allowed a question about whether a map wouldn’t show similar concentrations of Poles, an ethnic group with a reputation for insularity. He was informed that Poles in Detroit were less than half as segregated as Blacks. This seemed to surprise him.\nIn June, 1972, Roth issued the metropolitan remedy that the N.A.A.C.P. wanted. He brought fifty-three school districts in surrounding suburbs and small cities into the plan and required the authorities to distribute students among districts to achieve integration throughout the system. The ruling affected nearly eight hundred thousand students, and distributing them meant busing, or, as opponents called it, “forced busing.”\nThe “forced” part was the problem, because in 1971 forty-two per cent of American children took a bus to school as a matter of course. In most cases, no one had to force them. Parents liked busing. It saved them time and transportation costs. The yellow school bus was an iconic piece of Americana. Less commonly acknowledged was the fact that, under Jim Crow, Black schoolchildren were bused all the time.\nThe defendants appealed, but the Sixth Circuit largely upheld the verdict. That court was likely emboldened by a Supreme Court case decided while the Milliken trial was in progress: Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education.\nThe district court ruled that the school board had to adopt an integration plan that included busing in order to achieve racial balance. Some ten thousand students would be bused. Somewhat surprisingly, the Supreme Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Warren Burger, a Nixon appointee, unanimously upheld the order almost in its entirety. Busing to achieve racial integration was constitutionally permitted, it said.\nThere had been noisy local resistance surrounding the case, but the protests expired from exhaustion soon after the Court’s decision came down, and integration, at least in the early grades, seemed to be a success. In 1968, the average white student in the district had attended a school that was ninety per cent white. After the court order went into effect, the average white student attended a school that was sixty-nine per cent white.\nIf Swann looked like the future in 1971, it proved to be a mirage. Three years later, the Court took up the state of Michigan’s appeal in Milliken v. Bradley. It held, in a 5–4 vote, that, since there was no proof of discriminatory acts by the suburban school districts, the metropolitan remedy was “wholly impermissible.” The suburbs were being made to pay for the city’s bad behavior. The opinion noted that “no single tradition in public education is more deeply rooted than local control over the operation of schools.”\nThen why was the outcome in Swann not also an “impermissible” assault on local control? The answer is that although Charlotte-Mecklenburg covered an area of five hundred and fifty square miles, it contained a single school district. The desegregation remedy was therefore intradistrict. The proposed remedy in Milliken was interdistrict, and the Court was not inclined to cross district lines. It entrenched the concept of the neighborhood school.\nAs Adams puts it, the Supreme Court treated school districts as though they were mini-states. But there is nothing more sovereign or God-given about school districts than there is about congressional districts. The boundaries are entirely a function of who is drawing the map.\nStill, in a case decided two years after Swann, the Court doubled down. That case, San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, was not about desegregation. Much of American public-school funding comes from local property taxes, which is why the schools in suburban Detroit were so much better than the schools in the city. Rodriguez challenged this practice on the ground that it produced unequal results, with poor districts having much less to spend on education than affluent districts.\nThe least affluent school district in San Antonio, Edgewood, was about ninety per cent Mexican American and six per cent Black. The most affluent, Alamo Heights, was eighteen per cent Mexican American and less than one per cent Black. Per-pupil expenditure in Edgewood was $356; in Alamo Heights, it was $594.\nThe district court ruled that, because of this disparity, the plaintiffs had been denied equal protection. But the Supreme Court reversed the decision. The Court asked and answered two questions. The first was whether differences in wealth triggered “strict scrutiny” under the equal-protection clause. The Court said no. Poverty, unlike race, is not a “suspect class.” The poor have no special rights just because they’re poor.\nThe second question was whether education is what courts call a fundamental right. Fundamental rights are rights the state is not supposed to deprive you of except under circumstances where the public good overwhelmingly outweighs the private harm. Some fundamental rights are enumerated in the Constitution: freedom of speech, the right to a jury trial, and so on. But some are not: the right to marry, to have custody over one’s children, to travel between states.\nWhen a fundamental right is at stake, courts are supposed to set a high bar for any encroachment on the right in question. In Rodriguez, however, the Court’s opinion, by Lewis Powell, held that education “is not among the rights afforded explicit protection under our Federal Constitution. Nor do we find any basis for saying it is implicitly so protected.”\nBut hadn’t Brown been all about the right to education? “Today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments,” Earl Warren had written for a unanimous Court. “It is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.” That sounds pretty fundamental.\nWarren stopped short of explicitly saying so, however. There was a reason he didn’t, and Powell must have known what it was. Earlier in the century, the Supreme Court had declared “liberty of contract” to be a fundamental right and had used it to proclaim much New Deal legislation unconstitutional. Critics of the Court blamed it for inventing a right in order to pursue an economic agenda, and the Justices reversed their position after a few decades. Fundamental-rights talk was still highly unpopular in 1954. Warren did not want to go there. It would have looked as though the Court had an agenda.\nBy the time of Rodriguez, though, fundamental rights were back. The right to privacy was a Warren Court creation. Powell was not being completely forthright when he acted as though Brown had not set a precedent to defend education as a fundamental right.\nRichard Nixon won the 1968 Presidential election by pursuing a “Southern strategy”—a campaign that appealed to Southern whites aggrieved by the passage of the Civil Rights Act—and he wanted to appoint a Southerner to the Court. “I don’t care if he’s a Democrat or a Republican,” Nixon told his Attorney General, John Mitchell, in an Oval Office conversation in 1971. “He must be against busing, and against forced housing integration. Beyond that, he can do what he pleases.”\nPowell was a Virginian. He thought that Brown had been wrongly decided, but his decision not to openly defy it put him on the safe side for confirmation. The Senate had recently rejected two Nixon Supreme Court nominations in part because of their records on race.\nAs it happened, Powell, too, had a record on race. He had been the chair of the Richmond school board from 1952 to 1961. In the year he stepped down, there were about twenty-three thousand Black schoolchildren in Richmond, and only thirty-seven were attending previously all-white schools. He went on to serve on the state board of education, until 1969. In that capacity, as his biographer, John C. Jeffries, Jr., puts it, he “never did any more than was necessary to facilitate desegregation.” Though this history was raised during Powell’s confirmation hearings, the Senate approved his appointment by a vote of eighty-nine to one. Richmond was still in litigation over school desegregation in 1974, twenty years after Brown.\nWas this all the fault of the Court? After 1972, it was plain that busing mandates had made court-ordered school desegregation explosively unpopular among white voters. The winner of the 1972 Democratic Presidential primary in Michigan was George Wallace, the governor of Alabama, who was known for his segregationist views. He won seventy-nine of the state’s eighty-three counties. Court-ordered busing in Boston, in 1974, sparked protests that convulsed the city.\nNixon had campaigned on an anti-busing platform in 1972, and he won sixty per cent of the popular vote, carrying forty-nine states. There was talk of a constitutional amendment prohibiting busing as a tool of desegregation. In 1975, a liberal from a Northern state, Joe Biden, began supporting anti-busing legislation in the Senate (as Kamala Harris would one day remind him). The Departments of Justice and of Health, Education, and Welfare began to ease off enforcement of Brown. The courts could not expect much executive or legislative support for desegregation orders.\nColeman expected that the results of his study would confirm the benefits of school desegregation. Instead, what they showed was that the quality of the school on its own had little to do with student achievement. Much more determinative, he found, was the “home, neighborhood, and peer environment.” Being around more academically motivated students helped, but the main forces of inequality were outside school.\nAdams discusses the Coleman report. She does not discuss two papers that may have had a bigger impact on learned opinion. Both were by Daniel Patrick Moynihan: “The Negro Family,” written in 1965 for the Department of Labor, where Moynihan was an Assistant Secretary, and “The Schism in Black America,” published in The Public Interest in 1972. Moynihan’s conclusions paralleled Coleman’s: the principal cause of Black underachievement was not white racism. It was the structure of the Black family, over which public policy had limited control. In 1970, Moynihan suggested to Nixon that it might be best to treat civil-rights issues with “benign neglect.”\nBy the time Moynihan’s second paper came out, many white liberals, distracted by the war in Vietnam and disenchanted by Black militancy, had given up on the crusade for civil rights. It was possible to think that ending segregation did not require compulsory integration. Coleman and Moynihan became respectable excuses for getting off the train.\nYet the idea that someone could measure the effects of the civil-rights revolution when it had barely begun was preposterous. In 1966, when Coleman released his report, hardly any school desegregation had occurred anywhere in the United States. The Civil Rights Act was two years old.\nAnd how could Moynihan have expected to see racial transformation just eight years after Black people had been granted legal protection from discrimination in education and employment, and just four years after the passage of the Fair Housing Act? Insofar as Moynihan and Coleman showed that desegregation was only one step on the road to full equality, they were obviously not wrong. Still, it was a little soon to draw conclusions.\nToday, only ten per cent of Black students attend an all-Black or almost all-Black school, and only fourteen per cent of white students are in schools that are more than ninety per cent white. But progress is uneven. District courts began terminating desegregation orders in the early nineteen-nineties, and when the orders stopped so did the desegregation. In Charlotte, the busing order was lifted in 1999 by Judge Robert Potter, a former campaign worker for Senator Jesse Helms who had been nominated by Ronald Reagan on Helms’s recommendation. In 2018, less than two decades after Potter lifted the order, Charlotte-Mecklenburg was the most segregated school district in North Carolina.\nIn Detroit, some suburban schools closest to the city flipped from being virtually all white to being virtually all Black as whites moved farther out. Harper Woods, an inner-ring suburb, had zero Black students in 1975; in 2024, it was eighty-seven per cent Black. The number of students in Detroit public schools is now less than fifty thousand, and just two per cent of the students are white. Clinton Elementary School, where Ronald Bradley went, closed in 2009. According to the Michigan Department of Education, the student body at the time was 99.52 per cent Black. The February letter from the Department of Education is a pretty clear signal that even modest efforts to address racial inequality (forget about the history of discrimination, forget about even mentioning the subject of race) are no longer on the table where the wealthy and the powerful now dine. ♦","summary":"Two decades after Brown v.

Subscribe here.\n\nBefore President Trump even took office in January, his personal envoy delivered an unlikely win. Since last spring, President Biden’s diplomats had been unable to get Israel and Hamas to agree to a cease-fire. But Trump’s man, real estate billionaire Steve Witkoff, joined the Biden team’s effort weeks before the inauguration. Witkoff put immense pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reportedly saying that his relationship with the incoming American president depended on him accepting the deal. After a 96-hour marathon of talks in Qatar, Witkoff clinched a cease-fire and hostage exchange.\n\nIn so doing, Trump appeared to make good on his robust outreach to Arab and Muslim voters, who had helped him carry swing states. The campaign promised that Trump would prioritize two things: “an end to the wars, and a lasting peace in the Middle East that is satisfactory to all parties,” Bishara Bahbah, chair of Arab Americans for Trump, told me. And he had already checked off item one.\n\nBut weeks into his second term, Trump suggested that the U.S. would forcibly displace Palestinians in Gaza, that the United States would occupy the territory as part of a “Gaza Riviera” plan, full of threats and ethnic cleansing. He doubled down on the idea in an outlandish AI-generated social media post, with him lying on the beach shirtless beside Netanyahu, and a song playing “no more tunnels, no more fear, Trump Gaza is finally here.”\n\nThe cease-fire did not hold beyond its first phase, amid Israel’s violations. Israel has also blocked all humanitarian transfers to Palestinians, in what is by any measure of international law a war crime. Among the other seemingly contradictory moves, Trump dismantled most international assistance with the exception of Israel, where he fast-tracked $12 billion of arms sales and military aid.\n\nI asked Bahbah, who is Palestinian American, how he squares Trump’s cease-fire with the rest of it. “President Trump’s talk about a Riviera of the Middle East and displacement of Palestinians really, really upset the Arab American, Muslim American communities, but at the same time we know that the president was throwing this idea out as a negotiating tool.” It wasn’t offensive enough for him and his group to break with the president. “I don’t see them as really being serious policy statements,” Bahbah says.\n\nTrump’s varied coalition of appointees, donors, and other informal advisers each want different things from him.\n\nWith Trump back in the White House, foreign-policy observers are again scrambling to make sense of his unconventional brand of statecraft: how much to take literally versus seriously, whether everything is transactional and personality-driven or whether a broader intent can be surmised. Middle East stakeholders are giving Trump the benefit of the doubt despite his aggressive and outrageous threats against Palestinians, a group that has been subject to what human rights groups call a genocide and of whom millions have already been internally displaced by Israel. There is no Trump doctrine to be gleaned, but there is a Trump factor: this president’s capacity, whether because world leaders fear him or trust him, to bring about definitive, comprehensive, and structural changes that have long-lasting policy effects.\n\nThis assessment of Trump is by no means an effort to wishcast him into being a president of peace, or obscure actions that are detrimental to American interests. Instead, this is an acknowledgment that Trump’s approach to Israel and Palestine, even in his first term, fundamentally reshaped American policy. He shattered taboos by moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights, labeling products made in the occupied West Bank as Israeli, withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, and refocusing all U.S. diplomatic efforts on pushing forward normalization deals between Israel and Arab states that cut out Palestinians.\n\nBiden took Trump’s policy and boxed himself in. There was no Trump-proofing of Middle East policy because Biden’s team had largely taken on its predecessor’s strategy. Trump, then, is a product, not a departure, from long-standing American policy.\n\nWhat’s also clear is that Trump’s varied coalition of appointees, donors, and other informal advisers each want different things from him. Witkoff may be a pragmatist despite a staunch pro-Israel orientation, but Middle East policymaking will nonetheless be contested. Trump has elevated many pro-Israel stalwarts, alongside foreign-policy realists.\n\nBut will that mean that the president would stand by should Israel strike Iran’s nuclear program, or perhaps even enable such an escalatory attack? Will Trump facilitate Israel’s mass displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, or the further displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank? What will his emphasis on Israel and Saudi Arabia dealmaking mean for Palestinians, other Arab neighbors, and Americans?\n\nThere may be much to disagree with, sometimes vehemently so, about Trump in the Middle East. But as one career official who served during Trump’s first term put it, there’s validity to breaking with the Mideast policy of the establishment, which created an Israeli-Palestinian peace process that has long been on ice and deepened endless destructive wars. “A theme that is consistent between 45 and 47 is that the institutions and norms that we have built up and clung to for quite some time have not been working,” he told me. “They haven’t been working for American interests. They haven’t been working for global stability.”\n\nEVERYONE IS TRYING TO MAKE SENSE of the gap between Trump’s words and actions. Those around him interpret his remarks with a generosity rarely afforded to any other politician. Witkoff has avoided discussing the Riviera plan and told the American Jewish Committee that Trump is talking this way about Gaza “because for the last four decades, the other ways of thinking have not worked.”\n\nMany observers, particularly Republicans, have been working overtime to ascribe a degree of soundness or clarity to Trump’s often unhinged outbursts. H.R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser from 2017 to 2018, laid out a framework for interpreting the president at the Council on Foreign Relations. In the Oval Office during his first term, Trump had suggested taking the curious step of bombing fentanyl labs in Mexico. “I don’t think he was really asking me for options to bomb the labs,” McMaster explained. But he was, in essence, saying, “What we’re doing right now is not working. Why don’t you bring me some options?” In other words, while Democrats, progressives, and others call out the dangerous, off-the-cuff remarks of the president, his supporters strain to find a kernel of actionable policy.\n\nThe only consistency, according to another former national security adviser, John Bolton, is that the president looks after his own interests and relationships. “His thinking was like an archipelago of dots (like individual real estate deals), leaving the rest of us to discern—or create—policy,” he writes in his White House memoir, The Room Where It Happened. “That had its pros and cons.” It gives room for advisers to advance their own pet projects and also leads to intense infighting, and often stagnation.\n\nStill, many assessments of Trump’s governing style from the first term are pertinent. The wanton demolition of American foreign assistance worldwide will have major implications not only for Palestinians but also neighboring Middle East countries that have come to rely on American development and humanitarian programs. To understand it all, I keep coming back to the 2018 coinage of Prospect alum Adam Serwer in The Atlantic: The cruelty is the point.\n\nGoing after the U.S. Agency for International Development shows an eagerness to punish agencies perceived to have a progressive bent. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller has claimed, without evidence, that 98 percent of USAID staff had donated to Kamala Harris or another left-wing candidate. Beyond the effects on some 10,000 federal workers and contractors, the suffering outside the United States will be vast and unprecedented, and certainly detrimental to American soft power in the Middle East and elsewhere.\n\nNote that the International Development Finance Corporation, another federal agency focused on foreign assistance, hasn’t been completely wiped out, likely because it helps companies rather than individuals. Trump’s appointee to run it is Benjamin Black, the son of private equity billionaire Leon Black.\n\nThe cruelty similarly seems to be the point of launching a crackdown on Palestine activists, especially on university campuses. ICE’s abduction of Columbia student protester and legal U.S. resident Mahmoud Khalil offers the most extreme example to date. The weaponization of antisemitism claims and the emphasis on law enforcement to limit speech and political activity mirrors Trump’s first-term policies like the so-called Muslim ban and the harsh response to Black Lives Matter protesters. It’s worth emphasizing, as the historian Ussama Makdisi has, that the casual racism against Palestinians, as epitomized by the Trump Gaza video, is the “culmination of a bipartisan U.S. consensus that for a century has waged war on the idea that Palestinians deserve equality and freedom.”\n\nIt’s no coincidence that one of Trump’s first major speeches of this term was at a Saudi investment summit in Miami, much like his first foreign visit, in 2017, was to Riyadh. In Miami, he told business titans that the kingdom is “a special place with special leaders,” and celebrated its hosting of a U.S.-Russia summit in Riyadh. He lambasted “the fake news media” to a crowd convened by the kingdom’s primary sovereign wealth fund, which Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud oversees.\n\nIt was all the more disturbing considering that the CIA determined that MBS had ordered the torture, killing, and disappearance of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Which is to say, forget human rights, press freedom, and accountability for transnational crimes—core tenets of American foreign policy across administrations of both parties. Elon Musk sat in the front row next to MBS confidant Yassir Al-Rumayyan, who runs the Saudi fund. Everything is business.\n\nBut that also means that Trump likes to throw fresh eyes on everything and explore risky avenues in the hopes of a good payout. “Well, this didn’t work. What about that? What’s the ultimate goal? The ultimate goal is to have a peaceful Middle East. How do we get there? And yeah, he doesn’t care what taboos may be broken,” a former Trump White House official told me. “Corporate America does that often, sometimes with good results and sometimes with awful results.”\n\nTrump is willing to push the bounds of taste at every turn in order to stay in the spotlight, using racism and insult comedy to provoke. “There’s a real entertainment angle to everything he does,” a senior defense official from Trump’s first term told me. “He is super entertaining, and his base thinks he is hilarious. It’s not that deep.”\n\nThe unpredictability is constant. It’s hard to imagine any other president meeting in the Oval Office with freed Israeli hostages at the same time his envoy is engaging in direct talks with Hamas. “Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,” Trump posted in early March on Truth Social. He’s all in on war crimes while being in direct talks with Hamas. He’s all over the place.\n\nThat unpredictability, as the former career official told me, has a certain methodology to it. “There’s a real art,” he explained, “keeping people off balance, and throwing out at times suggestions that just mix things up and cause people to lose their minds for a little bit, in hopes with following that up with a suggestion that is also really good for the United States.”\n\nAnd it should be said that the most influential adviser is always the last person in the room with him.\n\nAS PRESIDENT TRUMP WENT AROUND the chamber shouting out officials in his speech to Congress in early March, it became clear that Witkoff holds a stature in this administration on par with cabinet leaders. He’s Trump’s personal White House emissary and has his full faith, especially as compared to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. “Good luck, Marco,” Trump said in the speech. “Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong.”\n\nIn contrast to setting Rubio up as the fall guy, Trump didn’t mention Witkoff by name but ticked off many of his accomplishments, including the release of American schoolteacher Marc Fogel from Russian prison and the return of Israeli hostages from Gaza, which are admittedly pretty remarkable wins for a first month of the presidency.\n\nWitkoff brings the hard-nosed demeanor of a Harlem landlord who used to carry a sidearm and once kept a copy of the book Tough Jews on his desk. A 1999 New York Observer profile called him a “knifelike man.” Even the piece’s title was evocative: “Steve Witkoff’s Nine Lives: Tough Guys Don’t Fold—They Crawl Back From the Abyss.” He survived boom-and-bust cycles as he built a real estate empire in Manhattan. But though Witkoff emerges from a traditional pro-Israel background and Trump’s New York developer milieu, pragmatism so far is the defining feature of his diplomacy.\n\nSeveral sources told me that Witkoff will be the main address for Israel policy, in contrast to Biden, who had several points of contact: Secretary of State Tony Blinken, CIA director Bill Burns, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, and Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk.\n\nBut beyond Witkoff running point, there’s not much cohesion to Trump’s Middle East policy—likely by design. “It’s a wide range of voices,” Victoria Coates, a former deputy national security adviser to Trump, said recently at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “That’s what he likes to have around him. He likes to hear from a lot of different people before he makes decisions.” The added caveat, as the writer Sam Adler-Bell recently argued in New York magazine, is that this leads to a Godfather-style model of various factions battling for power, none of them quite satisfied and all of them on edge.\n\nThere’s not much cohesion to Trump’s Middle East policy—likely by design.\n\nMike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, holds traditional pro-Israel views. A former representative to Florida and a Green Beret, he has assembled a team of career officials and Republican foreign-policy hands. Among them is longtime Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committee aide Eric Trager, who wrote a 2016 book on the Muslim Brotherhood’s brief stint in power in Egypt.\n\nIran will be a contentious fault line among Trump’s varied team. Waltz has expressed hawkish dogma on Iran, arguing that the U.S. ought not to stop Israel from launching attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. This stands in immense contrast to Vice President JD Vance and his advisers, who trend toward realism and strike a different tone entirely.\n\nOne fulcrum point is the Defense Department’s number three appointee, who if confirmed will set policy for the entire Pentagon. Elbridge Colby represents the realist strand in Trumpworld. As a strategist, he has argued strongly against attacking Iran, a view he backtracked on in his recent confirmation hearing as pro-Israel hawks lined up against him. He prioritizes a defense architecture centered on Asia and countering China, and thus has downplayed the importance of the Middle East more broadly, questioning the value of maintaining U.S. military bases in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe top Middle East civilian leader at the Pentagon, Michael Dimino, appears to hold a similar worldview. Dimino has written for the Quincy Institute’s web publication, Responsible Statecraft, on how bombing one’s way out of the Middle East won’t be productive and on the need to apply pressure on Israel to get more aid to Palestinians. “I do think international law has a role to play here,” Dimino told an interviewer about Gaza in November 2023. “I think that the importance of humanitarian aid getting into Gaza and holding our partners accountable, including Israel, on following the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions, all of that, is really important.”\n\nSecretary of State Rubio has long been close to Republican donor and pro-Israel hawk Miriam Adelson. So far, he has focused on Latin America policy and less so on Israel and Palestine. But Adelson spent $100 million on Trump’s 2024 campaign, and at some point she may want a return on that investment.\n\nOther State Department appointees will likely be more focused on the broader Middle East region, yet their roles may evolve. Ambassador-designate to the United Nations Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) has been one of the more militant vilifiers of pro-Palestinian speech, and she led the charge against university presidents last year. “Antisemitism and anti-Israel hate will not be tolerated on American campuses,” she posted when Trump announced federal funding would be withheld from universities that have protests. She is also a supporter of Israeli expansionism.\n\nIn Israel, U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee embodies the evangelical view of Israel. Huckabee is a hardcore Christian Zionist who published a cartoonish The Kids Guide to Israel, which paints Arabs and Palestinians as anti-Israel. He has expressed support, if not enthusiasm, for the expansionist Greater Israel project, and dismissed the idea of Israel’s occupation outright.\n\nBut in recent weeks, Huckabee has toned down his rhetoric. “A lot of people don’t understand that there are many Palestinians who live within the boundaries of Israel,” Huckabee told the evangelical media broadcaster Joel Rosenberg in an interview, “who live quite successfully and who prosper, and they live in peace.” That hasn’t totally precluded Huckabee from saying somewhat scary things like “I think we will see something of biblical proportion happen with [Trump’s] leadership in the Middle East.”\n\nPolicy toward Syria and Lebanon remains a wild card. Joel Rayburn has been nominated to serve as assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs. A retired military officer shaped by the Iraq War who served in the previous Trump administration in a Syria envoy role, he will likely be leading on Trump’s approach to the post-Assad landscape, which will have major knock-on effects for Israelis and Palestinians, and which the administration has said precious little about so far. Witkoff’s deputy, Morgan Ortagus, is said to be handling Lebanon. She is a Republican operative who founded the Polaris National Security think tank and served in the State Department during Trump’s previous term. Her organization is very hawkish on Iran.\n\nPro-Israel voices are not just coming from the Adelson camp. “The hyper-online right,” as pundit Erick Erickson calls it, is another constituency on Israel policy. One influential figure may be Jacob Helberg, nominee for a senior economic post at the State Department who emerged from the military and surveillance tech company Palantir, which has been enthusiastically pro-Israel since the October 7 attacks. Helberg has disparaged Palestinian protesters, and played a big role in the campaign to mobilize Silicon Valley titans to support Trump.\n\nThough Elon Musk appears largely focused on gutting government spending and regulations, one wonders whether he might end up playing an influential role on Israel policy. Over the years, he’s become a regular visitor to the country and its high-tech firms, which have played an integral role in the surveillance, targeting, and killing of Palestinians. Musk has also courted Gulf money—he spoke last year at the Saudi investment summit in Riyadh and sat in the front row of Trump’s Miami speech—and the potential business benefits of Trump’s policies may add more urgency to it as a priority. And Musk secretly met with Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations days after Trump won the election, which shows an interest in diplomatic action.\n\nAlso contributing to the conflicting range of views is Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who has variously expressed hard-line pro-Israel stances and personally visited the now-ousted Syrian president in 2017 when he was widely considered a pariah and war criminal.\n\nSon-in-law Jared Kushner has no formal role this term, and is just available as an adviser. But this time around, Trump’s kitchen cabinet is not strictly Zionist. Massad Boulos, a Lebanese American businessman and the father-in-law of daughter Tiffany Trump, helped deliver Arab American voters and claimed a senior adviser role.\n\nTrump’s instincts on the Middle East, like everything, can be surprising, which means sometimes he is much more critical of Israel than the typical Republican. The author Peter Beinart pointed out in a recent essay for Jewish Currents that early in the last term, Trump sought concessions from Netanyahu and was not hesitant in criticizing the Israeli leader. (I recently worked as interim editor at Currents.) But ultra-pro-Israel advisers in Trump’s inner circle, most notably Kushner, found ways to outmaneuver the president and ensure that the White House’s approach benefited Israel. As Beinart put it, “Even though Trump at times campaigned as a peace candidate who would end Israel’s wars in Gaza and Lebanon, this growing team clearly signals that he’s likely to help Israel make them even more brutal.”\n\nTRUMP BARELY TOUCHED ON the Middle East in his address to a joint session of Congress, perhaps because he wanted to keep expectations low after the first phase of the Israel-Hamas cease-fire. He briefly said his priority was bringing back the Israeli hostages from Gaza. That contrasts with Netanyahu, who has committed to continuing the war, as analysts point out, because it’s politically useful for an Israeli prime minister facing corruption charges. In his remarks, Trump also said he’s intent on expanding normalization deals for Israel in the Arab region. He didn’t name Saudi Arabia outright, but that’s very much the goal, and Palestinians stand to lose the most.\n\nFive years on, the accomplishment of the so-called Abraham Accords between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco that Trump’s team negotiated is that their diplomatic relations withstood Israel’s mass killing and war crimes. In lived experience for citizens of those three Arab states, the effects are rather limited. These countries were not at war with Israel, and already had many informal links. In a sense, they were more arms deals than peace deals; Israeli military contractors recently tabled at an arms expo in the UAE.\n\nSome analysts have argued that ignoring Palestinians in the accords led to the October 7 attacks. The Biden administration overlooked the Palestinian issue from the outset and kept a single-minded focus on extending that normalization to Saudi Arabia. The Democratic president’s message for Palestinians was that of paltry economic peace for a people who, even before October 7, experienced in 2023 the most deaths of Palestinian children since the United Nations began counting, and no horizon for political change.\n\nThe enthusiasm for an Abraham Accord for Saudi Arabia has not dampened, despite the disastrous results in Gaza. Both the Trump I and Biden administrations floated unprecedented inducements for Saudi Arabia, including nuclear-enrichment technology for a civilian program and an extraordinary defense treaty that would offer the kingdom NATO-like protections. Now, Trump seems poised to offer these incentives and more in exchange for MBS establishing diplomatic relations with Israel.\n\nTrump the bully, the strongman, may be able to achieve impressive ends through deplorable means.\n\nIsraeli tech ventures are particularly excited about doing more business in Saudi, but have already found ways to do just that, quietly developing extensive business and military ties: Israel has sold Saudi Arabia a dangerous cyber weapon; Saudi Arabia welcomed Israeli officials to visit the Kingdom. But I’ve been confused by how any of this would serve U.S. interests. Biden’s team said such an arrangement would firmly put Saudi Arabia in the U.S. camp and keep it away from partnering with Russia and China.\n\nFor what it’s worth, the great purveyor of foreign-policy realism, Henry Kissinger, wasn’t convinced the U.S. should offer Saudi Arabia so much. “I’m very uneasy,” he told the Council on Foreign Relations in early October 2023, in one of his last public appearances just days before the Hamas attack. “The idea that a third country should pay all the price, and another country should benefit, does not give you much hope for the sincerity” of the agreement.\n\nThe gold-standard offer, which for whatever reason has not been resuscitated two decades after its initial proposal, is the Arab Peace Initiative. The Saudi-backed opportunity would provide that all Arab states recognize Israel, in exchange for the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state. Thomas Friedman previewed the idea from MBS’s predecessor in a New York Times column back in 2002, and it’s still one of the most sensible solutions to all this.\n\nMBS did not set out to be the savior of Palestine, but he may decide that such a role would be in his own personal interest and a way to shore up support among his constituencies. He’s evolved on this issue and has called Israel’s offensive a “genocide.” That MBS hosted the first meeting between top Russian and American diplomats since the 2022 start of the Ukraine war suggests the crown prince prizes geopolitical power and maintains some leverage over Trump.\n\nAvoiding another conflagration may make Trump willing to put pressure on Netanyahu to get some accommodation for Palestinians, though what MBS may be asking for—Palestinian statehood—is likely not on offer from the Israelis. But it’s an ill fit with Trump’s Gaza Riviera plan. If that was the opening salvo for Mr. Dealmaker, then what does it mean in practice? Bizarrely, it may be a call for the Palestinians to speak up. Coates, now the vice president of the Heritage Foundation, argued at the recent panel that the Palestinians excluded themselves in Trump’s first term; this time, she argued, they would be better served by coming to the table.\n\n“The question about what we’re going to do about a one-state, a two-state, a three-state, a four-state solution is ultimately going to be up to the Palestinians,” Coates said. “I have said this to every Palestinian that will talk to me over the course of the last eight years: You have your most leverage now; you should use it. President Trump expects you to use it. He expects you to negotiate on your behalf, but you have to engage to get there.”\n\nSomehow, optimism for a pragmatic approach remains despite the “crazy video,” according to an Arab American Republican in Trump’s orbit. His approach is “all about real estate, land, land swaps—land, land, and more land,” they told me. “And it’s about using the negotiation tactics that they’ve learned in their real estate deals to get a peace deal. Both sides have got to give up something to get something. No buyer’s remorse here, you know, haggle until you get to an agreement.”\n\nI was frankly surprised by how sanguine this individual was, considering the brashness of Trump’s remarks, but they saw it as a positive development that the Gaza Riviera comments had already jolted the Arab League into action. Their expedited response to Trump reflected the real possibility of popular uprisings spreading across the region in response to the violent displacement of Palestinians and in solidarity with Palestinian rights. It’s not overstating the case to say that Trump could weaken the already brittle regimes in Egypt and Jordan simply by continuing to repeat his comments.\n\nSupport for Israel, as evidenced by the rushed arms transfers, will continue, though that hasn’t yet alienated his high-level Arab American supporters. “I think in the president’s mind, he feels that a secure Israel is an Israel that is capable of making peace,” Bahbah, the Palestinian American campaigner for Trump, told me. But the Arab American base seems much less willing to put up with the president’s rhetoric.\n\nThe impact may be more visceral on the ground. “This was obviously one of Trump’s signature negotiating tactics. But that doesn’t mean Israel is walking it back,” explained Tariq Kenney-Shawa of the think tank Al-Shabaka. “Israel continues to telegraph their intentions to move forward with the ethnic cleansing of Gaza by ensuring that it remains unlivable.” The abysmal humanitarian situation demands our attention, all while the Gaza-fication of the occupied West Bank is ongoing, with intensive Israeli military operations and displacement of 40,000 Palestinians.\n\nThe failure of the peace process industry in Washington and the Democrats under Biden and Obama to make any significant progress on Israel-Palestine has created a remarkable opening for Trump, and one that he will likely exploit most of all on the proposed Saudi normalization deal. Of course, real estate is a factor as well, one that may work to Trump’s advantage. “They’re all trying to build up their wealth. Look at how, how far, the UAE has come. Saudi has these plans to have tourist resorts and that big city that they’re building, Neom. This all gets in the way,” the former Trump White House official told me. “The Palestinian issue mucks it all up for them, and so they just want it to go away.”\n\nTHE FOCUS ON MIDDLE EAST DIPLOMACY and stated commitment toward a Saudi-Israel deal doesn’t mean that the Trump administration won’t nonetheless turn toward militarism. Hard power appears all-important to the president; see his brazen comments on taking over the Panama Canal and Greenland. And though Trump paid lip service toward peace in the campaign, he has often suggested bombing as a solution, reaching for military answers to political problems. Contradictions abound: He may withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq or Syria while reaching for military options in other scenarios. He has already ordered airstrikes on Iraq, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.\n\nTrump keeps coming back to “peace through strength,” which incidentally is also a favorite mantra of Netanyahu’s. Some Trump advisers may champion similar chest-thumping to Biden’s team on Israel, with its proclamations that Israel is in its best regional position ever, given the assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leadership. This has led to a new hubris around Israel being able to shape the whole Middle East through military outcomes.\n\nBut as analyst Omar Rahman of the Middle East Council on Global Affairs explains, Israel’s military strength is unlikely to translate into much. “Even the United States, with all its power, resources, money, and 20 years of occupation in Iraq and in Afghanistan, was unable to determine the outcomes it wanted to see in both of those countries, as the global superpower,” Rahman told me. “So how’s Israel just dropping American-made bombs going to do anything but engender more radicalism and extremism and hate for both Israel and the United States?”\n\nA serious concern is whether Trump would be willing to blow up the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt, or the treaty between Israel and Jordan. Rahman notes that Egypt continued its relations with Israel despite the Sabra and Shatila massacres during the Lebanese civil war, and both countries maintained relations throughout the second Intifada. Now, leaders of the UAE have indicated that none of Israel’s obliteration of Gaza has gotten in the way of their Abraham Accord with Israel.\n\nTrump the bully, the strongman, the unpredictable leader who wants peace, perhaps only for his own benefit or for the glory of a Nobel Prize, may be able to achieve impressive ends through deplorable means. He may get countries to accommodate his desires, however irrational, because they don’t want to confront him. He may also leave Israel unrestrained, especially in its military campaigns in Syria and the West Bank.\n\nAll of this presents a strange opportunity to refocus on what American interests actually are in the Middle East. Though Trump himself is more Trump First than America First, some advisers are genuinely focused on advancing U.S. interests in the Middle East. There do seem to be enough realists and pragmatists in the administration that Trump may surprise, as he did with the short-lived Israel-Hamas cease-fire. There’s not really space for true optimism, but diplomacy and cease-fires are good things that serve American interests.\n\nEven if Mideast diplomacy is centered in Witkoff’s office, there will be bigger arguments over the presence of American troops, how to engage with Iran, and what a future for Palestine might look like. Witkoff’s visit to Gaza and his colleague, hostage envoy Adam Boehler, talking directly with Hamas shows that his office has both the buy-in and the armor to engage in ways presidential envoys haven’t in recent memory. Beginning a conversation with Iran, for example, could open up further opportunities.\n\nThis isn’t to give the president the benefit of the doubt, as so many Republicans have as they trip over themselves to interpret his sometimes grotesque remarks through a policy lens.

You originally found out that her daughter was actually nonbinary, maybe trans and going by they/them. \n\n“You see Laurie struggling to explain it to her friends, struggling to use they/them pronouns, struggling with the language, which was all interesting,” she continued. \n\n“It was only a short scene, but for me, it did make the question [in episode three] of whether Kate voted for Trump so much more provocative and personally offensive to Laurie, considering who her child is in the world.”\n\nThe Sinner star added: “But the season was written before the election. And considering the way the Trump administration has weaponised the cultural war against transgender people even more since then, when the time came to cut the episode down, Mike felt that the scene was so small and the topic so big that it wasn’t the right way to engage in that conversation.”\n\nTrump’s executive order to ban trans people from the military - one of several orders that explicitly removes federal recognition of trans people - claims that the “adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual’s sex conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honourable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life.”\n\nThe president’s actions have faced legal challenges, with several judges ruling against his administration's policies. Judge Ana Reyes argued that a categorical ban on trans service members in the nation’s military discriminates based on transgender status and sex and “is soaked in animus.”\n\nCoon’s revelation comes after Duke University slammed The White Lotus last week for including its merchandise in scenes where Timothy Ratliff (Jason Isaacs) considers killing his wife. \n\nIsaac’s character went to Duke and is wearing a t-shirt from the university as he plans to shoot his partner in a bid to escape the impending repercussions of a shady business deal. \n\nA Duke spokesperson said the episode “simply goes too far” and “mistakenly suggests an endorsement or affiliation where none exists.”\n\n“Suicide is the second-leading cause of death on college campuses,” he added. \n\n“As imagery from the show is being shared widely across social media, we are using our brand to promote mental health awareness and remind people that help is available.”\n\nIf you have been affected by this article, you can contact the following organisations for support: mind.org.uk, nhs.uk/livewell/mentalhealth, mentalhealth.org.uk.","summary":"‘It wasn’t the right way to engage in that conversation,’ actor said","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/carrie-coon-mike-white-donald-trump-white-lotus-b2724402.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/31/8/06/The-White-Lotus-Trump.png?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/oVdI28ps-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-31 09:00:13","author":"Lydia Spencer-Elliott","authors":["Lydia Spencer-Elliott"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.022},{"id":306017558,"title":"The Wisconsin Supreme Court vote is getting national attention and millions from Musk","text":"Many of the country's most contested issues and hottest partisan politics are playing out in a race for the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The election is Tuesday.\n\nAt the state level, abortion rights, voting rights and the powers of public employee unions could all be in the balance in future court rulings.\n\nAnd impacting the national scene, the court could determine whether the state redraws its congressional districts along lines that end up narrowing or ending the majority that Republicans hold in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nMoney is pouring in from around the country, with millions of dollars in support of the conservative candidate coming from billionaire Elon Musk, who visited the state Sunday night for a rally donning a cheesehead hat. He handed out $1 million to two people after a legal back-and-forth on whether the money amounted to bribing voters. The liberal candidate has received millions in support from billionaire George Soros, Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, a Wisconsin philanthropist and others.\n\nSpending on both sides is expected to reach $100 million, which is more than all but a few U.S. Senate races each cost last year. It's the most expensive state judge race ever, says The Brennan Center for Justice, a non-partisan think tank and democracy advocacy group.\n\nWisconsin's a swing state where President Trump narrowly defeated Kamala Harris in 2024. There's a Democratic governor, Tony Evers, and a Republican-controlled legislature. Tuesday's vote could be the first measure of Trump's popularity and Democrats' energy after the election five months ago. It could also be a referendum on Trump's close adviser, Musk.\n\nTwo county judges face off for a seat opening on the court\n\nSupreme Court races are non-partisan in Wisconsin, so there won't be a \"D\" or an \"R\" next to the justices' names on the ballot, but they are generally described as either liberal or conservative. This race would replace one of the four liberal-leaning judges on the seven-judge court for a 10-year term.\n\nBoth candidates are county judges. Brad Schimel is a Waukesha County judge and former Republican Wisconsin attorney general. He's endorsed by Trump. Dane County Judge Susan Crawford was endorsed by former President Barack Obama last week.\n\nCrawford worked as an assistant state attorney general and as chief legal counsel for former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. Schimel was Waukesha's district attorney and was elected state attorney general but lost a bid for a second term in that position in 2018.\n\nWith the heavy spending, voters are being barraged with ads on television, websites and mail by both campaigns and independent groups.\n\nThe issues: Abortion rights, voter ID, unions\n\nThe race has teed up many of the same issues as the last presidential election. On abortion rights, Crawford accuses Schimel of supporting an 1849 state law that is still on the books and before the court. It was used to block abortion in Wisconsin for over a year after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in 2022. Currently, abortion is legal up to about 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nSchimel acknowledges he has said the 1849 law is valid but says that abortion should be up to \"the will of the people.\" Democrats note he's opposed abortion in the past. Crawford talks about how she represented Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin when she was a private attorney.\n\nWisconsin is also home to one of the country's biggest battles over labor rights. As an attorney, Crawford worked for teachers opposed to a 2011 law prohibiting most public employees from collective bargaining. A judge recently blocked that law, which could be headed to the state supreme court.\n\nMeanwhile, Schimel has said he'll vote yes on a measure also on the ballot Tuesday to place voter ID requirements in the state constitution. Crawford says she doesn't think a judicial candidate should take a public position on something that could end up being interpreted by the court.\n\nThe Schimel campaign has also deployed an issue that GOP candidates say worked for them in 2024 — opposition to transgender rights. One campaign ad features a woman saying Crawford \"sides with\" radicals in favor of allowing \"transitioning male teachers\" in girls' bathrooms at school. Advocates for transgender rights say it's an example of fearmongering.\n\nMusk's millions, his paid petition and the outside money\n\nElon Musk and groups linked to him have reportedly spent at least $20 million in support of Schimel. The Associated Press reports that they have run misleading ads that appear to be from the Crawford camp and highlight controversial buzzwords. Musk has also offered $100 to anyone who signs a petition against \"activist judges\" and gave away $1 million to two petition signers. \n\nMusk says he's interested in the race because the court has power over redistricting for congressional elections and that if Crawford wins, \"then the Democrats will attempt to redraw the districts and cause Wisconsin to lose two Republican seats.\"\n\nCrawford supporters have highlighted Musk's involvement. \"Elon Musk is really trying to buy a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court,\" Crawford says.\n\n\"I have no control over whatever any outside group does. I will enforce the law. I will apply the law the way the legislature has written it,\" Schimel said in the one campaign debate.\n\nMusk has a matter in Wisconsin courts as CEO of Tesla. In January, the automaker sued seeking an exemption from a state law that bans car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers — as Tesla does — instead of going through dealers.\n\nCrawford says his spending far exceeds her top donors. Her biggest financial backer appears to be Wisconsin philanthropist Lynde Uihlein, who the Brennan Center says has given $6.2 million. Soros has given $2 million.\n\nThis story was written by NPR's Larry Kaplow with reporting from Chuck Quirmbach and Maayan Silver of WUWM and Rich Kremer and Anya van Wagtendonk of Wisconsin Public Radio.","summary":"The court could face cases on abortion, congressional maps and labor unions.

I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't even apply to one... it's all theatrics,' one critic said.\n\nAnother added: 'In other words, I don't want to go to grad school, but I can pose as a social Justice warrior and then get hired by dad's buddies think tank.'\n\nA third wrote: 'If virtue signaling paid well, she'd be a millionaire.' \n\nAnother warned that she was so 'brainwashed' that she was inadvertently 'screwing herself out of an education.'\n\nHope shared her 'life update' on her TikTok account, telling her followers: 'I got into grad school. I will not be attending starting this fall though, and I will no longer be attending the university that I originally applied for.\n\n'I applied for one school. I kind of had my heart set on one school and that's what I wanted to do. \n\n'I'm not going to name the institution but after recent events I decided I am not going to give my money, go into debt for, support institutions that don't support their students and the right to protest and speak out for their communities.\n\n'Students deserve to be protected. I'm not worried about if I were to be protected or not at said institution, I'm a privileged white woman, but I'm not going to put myself in a position where I'm giving money or supporting institutions that don't support their students.'\n\nWhile Hope did not name the school, several Ivy League institutions have been in the spotlight over protesting.\n\nColumbia University agreed last week to put its Middle East studies department under new supervision and overhaul its rules for protests and student discipline, in a move seen as bowing down to to an extraordinary ultimatum by the Trump administration.\n\nAs part of the sweeping reforms, the university will also adopt a new definition of antisemitism and expand 'intellectual diversity' by staffing up its Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies, according to a letter published Friday by the interim president, Katrina Armstrong.\n\nThe announcement drew immediate condemnation from some faculty and free speech groups, who accused the university of caving to President Donald Trump's largely unprecedented intrusion upon the school's academic freedom.\n\n'Columbia's capitulation endangers academic freedom and campus expression nationwide,' Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration pulled $400 million in research grants and other funding over the university's handling of protests against Israel's military campaign in Gaza. \n\nAs a precondition to restoring those funds - along with billions more in future grants - federal officials last week demanded the university immediately enact nine separate reforms to its academic and security policies.\n\nOn March 8, federal immigration officials arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent Palestinian activist and permanent resident in his university-owned apartment building.\n\nHe vowed it would be the 'first of many' attempted deportations. The case is ongoing. \n\nWhile Trump has made Columbia the most visible target of his crackdown on higher education, he has put other universities on notice that they will face cuts if they do not embrace his agenda.\n\nHis administration has announced investigations into 52 universities for their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. And it has suspended approximately $175 million in federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania over a transgender swimmer who last competed for the school in 2022.\n\nAnd in the comment section of Hope's video, she was inundated with current and former students who said their schools' stances 'broke their hearts.' \n\n'It's sad when these institutions don't support their communities,' one former student at John Hopkins said.\n\n'University of Michigan broke my heart,' another added.\n\nThe State Department has revoked more than 300 student visas connected to college students who protested in support of Palestine. \n\nHope said her criticism of the school she had been accepted into 'has nothing to do with students that currently go there, a lot of the faculty.'\n\n'But the people at the top are making these decisions and I decided that I'm not going to do that. \n\n'I'm going to do a little bit more research going forward, making sure I'm going to schools that align with my values and then maybe start in a year, which is okay.

And in his first months back in office, Trump has pushed the issue further, erasing mention of transgender people on government websites and passports and trying to remove them from the military.\n\nIt’s a contradiction of numbers that reveals a deep cultural divide: Transgender people make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, but they have become a major piece on the political chess board — particularly Trump’s.\n\nFor transgender people and their allies — along with several judges who have ruled against Trump in response to legal challenges — it’s a matter of civil rights for a small group. But many Americans believe those rights had grown too expansive.\n\nThe president’s spotlight is giving Monday’s Transgender Day of Visibility a different tenor this year.\n\n“What he wants is to scare us into being invisible again,” said Rachel Crandall Crocker, the executive director of Transgender Michigan who organized the first Day of Visibility 16 years ago. “We have to show him we won’t go back.”\n\nSo why has this small population found itself with such an outsized role in American politics?\n\nTrump’s actions reflect a constellation of beliefs that transgender people are dangerous, are men trying to get access to women’s spaces or are pushed into gender changes that they will later regret.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and other major medical groups have said that gender-affirming treatments can be medically necessary and are supported by evidence.\n\nZein Murib, an associate professor of political science and women’s, gender and sexuality studies at Fordham University, said there has been a decades-old effort “to reinstate Christian nationalist principles as the law of the land” that increased its focus on transgender people after a 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling recognizing same-sex marriage nationwide. It took a few years, but some of the positions gained traction.\n\nOne factor: Proponents of the restrictions lean into broader questions of fairness and safety, which draw more public attention.\n\nSports bans and bathroom laws are linked to protecting spaces for women and girls, even as studies have found transgender women are far more likely to be victims of violence. Efforts to bar schools from encouraging gender transition are connected to protecting parental rights. And bans on gender-affirming care rely partly on the idea that people might later regret it, though studies have found that to be rare.\n\nSince 2020, about half the states passed laws barring transgender people from sports competitions aligning with their gender and have banned or restricted gender-affirming medical care for minors. At least 14 have adopted laws restricting which bathrooms transgender people can use in certain buildings.\n\nIn February, Iowa became the first state to remove protections for transgender people from civil rights law.\n\nIt’s not just political gamesmanship. “I think that whether or not that’s a politically viable strategy is second to the immediate impact that that is going to have on trans people,” Fordham’s Murib said.\n\nMore than half of voters in the 2024 election — 55% — said support for transgender rights in the United States has gone too far, according to AP VoteCast. About 2 in 10 said the level of support has been about right, and a similar share said support hasn’t gone far enough.\n\nNevertheless, AP VoteCast also found voters were split on laws banning gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers or hormone therapy, for minors. Just over half were opposed to these laws, while just under half were in favor.\n\nTrump voters were overwhelmingly likely to say support for transgender rights has gone too far, while Kamala Harris’ voters were more divided. About 4 in 10 Harris voters said support for transgender rights has not gone far enough, while 36% said it’s been about right and about one-quarter said it’s gone too far.\n\nA survey this year from the Pew Research Center found Americans, including Democrats, have become more slightly more supportive of requiring transgender athletes to compete on teams that match their sex at birth and more supportive on bans on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors since 2022. Most Democrats still oppose those kinds of measures, though.\n\nLeor Sapir, a fellow at Manhattan Institute, a right-leaning think tank, says Trump’s and Republicans’ positions have given them a political edge.\n\n“They are putting their opponents, their Democratic opponents, in a very unfavorable position by having to decide between catering to their progressive, activist base or their median voter,” he said.\n\n“People across the political spectrum agree that in fact, the major crises and major problems facing the United States right now is not the existence and civic participation of trans people,” said Olivia Hunt, director of federal policy for Advocates for Trans Equality.\n\nAnd in the same election that saw Trump return to the presidency, Delaware voters elected Sarah McBride, the first transgender member of Congress.\n\nPaisley Currah, a political science professor at the City University of New York, said conservatives go after transgender people in part because they make up such a small portion of the population.\n\n“Because it’s so small, it’s relatively unknown,” said Currah, who is transgender. “And then Trump has kind of used trans to signify what’s wrong with the left. You know: ‘It’s just too crazy. It’s too woke.’”\n\nBut Democratic politicians also know the population is relatively small, said Seth Masket, director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver, who is writing a book about the GOP.\n\n“A lot of Democrats are not particularly fired up to defend this group,” Masket said, citing polling.\n\nFor Republicans, the overall support of transgender rights is evidence they are out of step with the times.\n\n“The Democrat Party continues to find themselves on the wrong side of overwhelmingly popular issues, and it proves just how out of touch they are with Americans,” National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Mike Marinella said.\n\nSome of that message may be getting through. In early March, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, launched his new podcast by speaking out against allowing transgender women and girls competing in women’s and girls sports.\n\nAnd several other Democratic officials have said the party spends too much effort supporting transgender rights. Others, including U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, have said they oppose transgender athletes in girls and women’s sports.\n\nJay Jones, the student government president at Howard University and a transgender woman, said her peers are largely accepting of transgender people.\n\n“The Trump administration is trying to weaponize people of the trans experience … to help give an archenemy or a scapegoat,” she said. But “I don’t think that is going to be as successful as the strategy as he thinks that it will be.”\n\nAssociated Press polling editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux contributed to this article.

Roosevelt’s unprecedented four elections, states: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”\n\nPressed to clarify whether he had been presented with any specific plans to bypass the limit, Trump replied: “There are – not plans – but there are methods which you could do it, as you know.”\n\n“I’m not joking,” Trump added, though he noted that “it is far too early to think about it.”\n\nAsked about a hypothetical scenario in which Vice President J.D.

His political adviser Steve Bannon recently told NewsNation that Trump could “run and win again in 2028,” hinting at possible legal maneuvers.\n\nEarlier this year, Republican Congressman Andy Ogles introduced a constitutional amendment that would allow a president to serve three non-consecutive terms, though it has so far gained little traction. Amendments to the Constitution require approval by a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, followed by ratification from three-quarters of US states.\n\nTrump won the 2024 election by a wide margin against Democratic candidate and then–Vice President Kamala Harris, becoming the second president in US history to serve two non-consecutive terms.","summary":"US President Donald Trump has told NBC News he is “not joking” about potentially seeking a third term in office \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/614989-trump-third-term-not-joking/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.03/article/67e9cca885f54007ac29f7a7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 23:01:49","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":305902862,"title":"Even Republicans cringe at chat leak.

You’ll also find data-based updates on past Daily Kos reporting, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\nYemen war plans, u up?\n\nIt was the text chain heard ‘round the world. On Monday, The Atlantic revealed that its top editor had been mistakenly added to a group chat in which top Trump administration officials planned a highly sensitive military operation in Yemen with all the seriousness the administration is known for.\n\n“👊🇺🇸🔥,” national security adviser Mike Waltz wrote, in response to Vice President JD Vance’s praise of the operation’s killing of the Houthi rebel group’s “top missile guy.”\n\nAs it turns out, Americans are less 👊🇺🇸🔥 about the leak, and more 🤬.\n\nOverall, 74% of U.S. adults consider it a serious problem that top Trump officials discussed sensitive war plans on an unclassified chat that included a journalist, according to YouGov. Only 13% don’t think it’s a problem. \n\nThe issue largely transcends partisanship too. Ninety percent of Democrats consider it a serious issue, as do 72% of independents. Even 60% of Republicans(!) consider it a problem. Only 24% of Republicans think texting a journalist sensitive war plans isn’t all that serious.\n\nOn the surface level, the breach recalls the “but her emails” scandal of 2015-16. During her time as former President Barack Obama’s secretary of state, Hillary Clinton used a private email server for official communications. Though the FBI twice cleared her of criminal wrongdoing, Republicans slammed her over the issue. It came to dominate the final days of the 2016 presidential election, and an FBI letter about the scandal very likely cost her the election, forcing Donald Trump onto us all.\n\nGiven the severe repercussions of the email scandal, you might expect it to have greatly troubled Americans at the time and probably more than this week’s leak. If so, you’d be wrong.\n\nIn early March 2015, days after The New York Times broke the emails story, a YouGov poll found that 56% of Americans considered her use of a private email server to be a serious problem, though only 30% considered it “very serious.” \n\nThat said, this poll was fielded over a month before Clinton launched her presidential campaign—and well before the “but her emails” scandal became the stuff of legend (or nightmares). And in September 2022, when YouGov asked about it again, 63% considered it to be a serious problem, with 41% now thinking it was “very serious.”\n\nBut that’s still less than the reaction to the war plans leak.\n\nThe poll on this week’s leak fiasco was conducted on Tuesday, one day after The Atlantic’s initial story, and the outlet released the chat’s full transcript on Wednesday. As the story develops and more folks learn about it, the polls are very likely to move, though it’s hard to say in which direction. \n\nFor instance, Republicans could soften their disapproval, just like they did about the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. Three days after that attack, only 16% of Republicans approved of the riot, according to YouGov. By June 2022, 31% did. And now election denialism is basically a prerequisite for Republican politicians.\n\nIn other words, don’t be surprised if you soon see the worst Republican you know waving a flag that says, “👊🇺🇸🔥.”\n\nSearch and DOGEstroy\n\nElon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency is operating on a false premise. Unlike his small-government, crony-capitalist vision of the U.S., Americans think it’s important that the government provides a lot of services.\n\nAn overwhelming 93% of likely voters want the government to provide benefits like Social Security, according to Data for Progress. That comes as Musk’s cuts to the Social Security Administration have basically crashed its system, though payments are still going out (for now).\n\nIn fact, more than 80% of Americans want the government to protect consumers from financial exploitation at the hands of banks, fully staff the National Park and U.S. Forest services, and provide student loans to low-income Americans.\n\nMusk and Trump have whittled away at each of those duties. In early February, the Trump administration ordered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to cease work, which will no doubt lead to more financial exploitation. Later that month, they canned hundreds of national park workers, threatening operating hours. And more recently, they set about blowing up the Education Department, which manages federal student loans.\n\nIt’s easy to see why Republican lawmakers are terrified of facing down voters at town halls.\n\nDemocrats think their party is a downer\n\nThe Democratic Party’s brand is in a rough spot. New data from YouGov finds that a majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (58%) think their party isn’t meeting the moment. And 75% say the party isn’t challenging the GOP forcefully enough.\n\nOnly 54% of Democrats think their party has a clear vision for the future. And less than half think their party is good at recruiting strong candidates (46%) and communicating its message (45%). All of that tracks since the party just lost a major election and lacks an obvious leader right now. (Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are MIA, and Barack Obama is busy filling out March Madness brackets.)\n\nRepublicans’ frustrations toward their own party just don’t compare. They rate their party lowest on its respect for democratic norms and its prioritization of the public interest over their own political gain. However, lowest doesn’t mean low: 60% of Republicans still give their party good marks in both areas.\n\nThe biggest gap between how partisans view their party? Eighteen percent of Republicans think their party lacks new leadership with fresh ideas, while a staggering 62% of Democrats think the same about their party. That yawning 44-percentage-point difference is no doubt due to Democrats like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, whose brand has become particularly toxic after he caved to Republicans on a bill to fund the government.\n\nAny updates?\n\n Your average American may not be texting war plans on an unsecured group chat that includes an Atlantic editor, but 39% of Americans have inadvertently sent a sensitive message to the wrong person, according to YouGov. That includes 17% who have done it more than once. Meanwhile, 51% are perfect angels who have never made such an error. \n\n Eric Adams, New York City’s shady-as-hell mayor, appears on track to get smoked in the Democratic primary for the position he currently holds. A new Data for Progress poll shows him in fourth place, with 7%, behind city Comptroller Brad Lander (8%), progressive state Rep. Zohran Mamdani (15%), and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who, at 39%, sits far in the lead. Will America’s most populous city replace an indicted mayor with an alleged sex pest who reportedly covered up nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic? We’ll have to wait a while to see. The Democratic primary is on June 24.\n\n TikTok, enemy No. 1 of attention spans in those under age 40, faces an April deadline to sell itself or be banned in the U.S. (Trump could also kick the deadline down the road again.) However, while 50% of American adults supported a ban in March 2023, support has ticked down to just 34%, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nSlowly but steadily, voters are souring on how Trump is handling his job as president, and according to Civiqs, he’s losing support especially quickly among a key voting bloc: independent women. His best numbers with them came in late January, when 53% disapproved of the job he was doing as president and 41% approved. That works out to him being 11 points underwater (when the numbers aren’t rounded).\n\nBut recently, that margin has doubled. As of Wednesday, Trump sits at 22 points underwater with independent women. Fifty-nine percent disapprove, and only 36% approve.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly column rounding up three of the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about.

She invested broadly in media, most notably in 2017 buying the distinguished magazine of 167 years, The Atlantic. \n\nNow as the owner of The Atlantic, she is the quiet superhero behind the current Signalgate scandal. Editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who in full disclosure I know well enough to have his email, has rightfully been taking a hero’s tour on media everywhere since he broke the story of having been “accidentally” included in a Signal chat group of the top national security officials talking about an imminent attack on the Houthis, in violation of every imaginable security protocol not to mention common sense. \n\nGoldberg is being praised, correctly, for his handling of this mess: by exiting the chat when he realized it was legitimate; by putting out the story immediately; by releasing the actual “war plans” on the chat when Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told Congress there was nothing classified about it; and by continuing to calmly tell the truth despite being attacked as a “sleazebag” among other insults by President Trump. \n\nAll true, and worthy of praise. And really hard to do. \n\nBut the person who has gone unnoticed and unsung for her role in this is Powell Jobs. At a time when billionaire owners of cherished publications that hold government accountable are caving — The Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos and Los Angeles Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong most prominently — Powell is standing behind her editor. \n\nOddly, though a billionaire, Powell Jobs has not found a reason to kiss Trump’s ring. She did not show up at the inauguration, she did not pledge to change editorial policy to make it friendlier to Trump’s agenda, she did not object to the magazine endorsing Kamala Harris last November.\n\nNone of that. She just continues to stand behind the journalism of her publication. \n\nNeed we remind you that the billionaire tech bros — starting with DOGE maniac Elon Musk, but including Meta’s Jeff Zuckerberg, Amazon’s Bezos, Peter Thiel and say-it-aint-so Participant founder Jeff Skoll — have lined up to publicly kiss Trump’s ring. They have shown their willingness to sacrifice the integrity of the media publications they own, when they do. \n\nEntertainment companies have similarly caved in the face of Trump’s bullying, whether Disney paying $15 million to make a lawsuit against George Stephanopoulos go away, or Shari Redstone’s Paramount Global negotiating against an absurd $20 billion lawsuit against “60 Minutes.” \n\nReminder that Amazon MGM studios paid $40 million to produce a documentary on Melania. Can’t wait to see that marketing and PR campaign. \n\nBy contrast, it is the billionaire tech women who have shown steely spines and higher principles. Rather than poison their own legacies by acting to appease a cruel, lying bully, rather than adopting his craven and chaotic policies that favor their wallets, they have stayed silent and continued their work on behalf of a better society.\n\nTheir work continues in the service of fighting disease, poverty, promoting social equity and the new “evil”: diversity. Melinda Gates — ex-wife of Bill Gates — is leading through her organization Pivotal Ventures, dedicated “to accelerate the pace of social progress.” The website says: “We’re working to get more power in the hands of more people — especially women.” Mackenzie Scott — ex-wife of Bezos — continues to pour her billions into philanthropic pursuits. She has given away a stunning $19 billion since 2019 to thousands of non-profits, mostly focused on economic security and education. \n\nPowell Jobs, with an estimated fortune of $15 billion, has poured her passion into Emerson Collective where she has mostly invested in media and something called “philanthrocapitalism,” aiming to achieve social impact through for-profit approaches. (That’s what Skoll used to do at Participant.) \n\nGoldberg emailed TheWrap when asked about Powell Jobs. \n\n“Laurene is tough, smart, and brave,” he wrote. “There are a lot of people at the publisher and owner levels who aren’t these things — brave, especially. I couldn’t imagine a better steward for The Atlantic. She honors our journalistic integrity and independence, and stands by us in hard times. What else could you possibly ask for?” \n\nAmong her other media investments are Axios Media, podcaster Gimlet Media and a second podcasting company called WaitWhat. For the record she backed convicted fraudster Carlos Watson in his Ozy Media venture in the late 1990s but nobody’s perfect. \n\nSince buying The Atlantic from David Bradley in 2017, the magazine has experienced a remarkable renaissance after the rough patch of COVID. Goldberg’s Atlantic has become a true rival to The New Yorker in attracting talent and landing deep investigative works. Indeed, as The Washington Post has bled credibility and talent, Goldberg has scooped up one major journalistic hitter after another, from Ashley Parker to Shane Harris to Michael Scherer. \n\nLate last year the magazine announced that it had surpassed 1 million subscriptions, and achieved profitability (painful to know that it wasn’t before then).\n\nThroughout, we’ve not heard a word from Powell Jobs. It seems that’s how she likes it. She shuns the spotlight, and “doesn’t get involved” in the running of the magazine, according to a knowledgeable individual. \n\nBut at moments like this, she deserves our praise and our gratitude. Our democracy needs superheroes like her to make it through.","summary":"Though a billionaire, Powell Jobs has not found a reason to kiss Trump’s ring.\n\n\nThe post In Praise of Laurene Powell Jobs, Owner of The Atlantic, Superhero of Signalgate appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/laurene-powell-jobs-atlantic-praise-signalgate/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Laurene-Powell-Jobs-at-the-2023-TIME100-Summit-April-25-2023.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 23:00:00","author":"Sharon Waxman","authors":["Sharon Waxman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.088},{"id":305885776,"title":"Anti-Trump UAW president backs tariffs on foreign-made cars: ‘They could bring work back in very short order’","text":"WASHINGTON — United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain said Sunday that President Trump’s looming 25% tariff on foreign-made cars could swiftly boost American manufacturing jobs.\n\nFain, a prominent anti-Trump campaigner ahead of last year’s election, said that the levies could benefit workers and use remarkably similar language as the White House on how carmakers could onshore jobs.\n\n“We have excess capacity” at manufacturing plants, Fain said, using near identical framing as the White House. “They could bring work back in very short order.”\n\n“Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing, and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here, and, you know, invest in the American workers,” Fain said in an interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”\n\nTrump’s stiff auto tariffs are set to take effect Wednesday and could trigger upheaval in the car industry.\n\nWednesday is also the advertised launch date for Trump’s 25% tariffs on other Canadian and Mexican goods and his “reciprocal” tariffs on other major trading partners such as the European Union and Japan.\n\nAbout half of vehicles sold in the US are foreign-made, mostly in Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea and Germany.\n\nFain wasn’t entirely uncritical of his longtime political foe — emphasizing that he wants union membership to grow as a result of a potential influx of auto jobs.\n\n“It doesn’t do any good if they’re going to locate them in places and they’re not going to have the opportunity to have a union, you know. And so naturally, we have concerns,” the union boss said.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s 2025 challenger, were closely aligned with the UAW — going so far as to snub non-unionized Tesla from a promotional electric vehicle showcase on the White House lawn.\n\nTrump and Fain have exchanged insults publicly, with the president calling on auto-union members to oust Fain, who on Sunday offered critical words about other Trump actions, calling him “deplorable” for moving to strip federal workers of union eligibility. \n\nThe auto tariffs were announced last week, with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro stressing that they also would apply to car parts.\n\nCanadian and Mexican car imports will be tariffed based on the percentage of parts that are US-made. If half of its parts are Americans, for example, the levy would be 12.5% rather than 25%.\n\n“Half of the roughly 16 million cars, SUVs and light trucks Americans bought in 2024 were imports,” Navarro said last week. “Of the remaining 8 million units, more than half of these cars were assembled from foreign parts. So what that means is less than 25% of the cars sold in America contain US content on average. That stops right now with the Trump auto tariffs.”\n\nThe idea of a 25% tariff on cars was previously studied by the US International Trade Commission, which said in a report last year that “[a] new 25% tariff on U.S. imports from outside of North America would reduce vehicle imports by 73.9%, increase average prices of vehicles in the United States by 5.0%, and increase variable profits from domestic production by 5.2%”\n\nThat report did not assess the effect of tariffing Canadian and Mexican imports, meaning the impact may be even greater.\n\nTrump has aggressively adopted tariffs during his second term after largely using the threat of tariffs during his first term to score trade reforms from other countries.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump slapped an additional 25% tariff on China, citing fentanyl smuggling, and in Februar,y he imposed a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum, without exceptions for major importers that previously were in effect.\n\nTrump has teased plans for tariffs on computer chips, copper, pharmaceuticals and other products — arguing it would boost the US economy, though critics say it could fuel inflation by making goods more expensive.","summary":"\"We have excess capacity\" at manufacturing plants, Fain said, using near identical framing as the White House. \"They could bring work back in very short order.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/us-news/anti-trump-uaw-president-backs-tariffs-on-foreign-made-cars-they-could-bring-work-back-in-very-short-order/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/newspress-collage-b0jvh4q39-1743363480204.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1743349097&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/uSNqoSFL-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-30 22:52:22","author":"Steven Nelson","authors":["Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.185}]}
