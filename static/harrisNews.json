This extra measure means the television audience will see the full, unedited interview on CBS and we will continue our practice of posting full transcripts and the unedited video online.\"\n\n A representative from the Department of Homeland Security responded to the news in a statement to EW. \"Americans are fed up with endless whitewashing by the media — they want the whole truth, and they deserve the whole truth,\" a spokesperson said. \"This week, Americans made that clear, and this is their victory.\"\n\n Noem previously accused CBS News of attempting to \"whitewash the TRUTH\" about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man who was deported to El Salvador in March, after the network shortened her response to a question about him.\n\n CBS News posted Ed O'Keefe's full unedited interview with Noem on YouTube on Sunday. The video runs for 16 minutes and 40 seconds, whereas the broadcast version ran for 12 minutes and 15 seconds.\n\n DHS slammed the edited interview in a press release on Sunday. CBS News initially said that the edited interview \"met all CBS News standards\" (via The New York Times). It is standard practice for broadcast news outlets to edit interviews in order to condense their runtimes, as most TV programs must fit all of their content into a strict, unchangeable time block.\n\n CBS News' journalistic practices and policies regarding political coverage have been subject to widespread scrutiny in the last 12 months. In November, Donald Trump filed a lawsuit against the network's parent company, Paramount, after Face the Nation aired an interview with his political opponent in the presidential election, Kamala Harris. Trump sought $10 billion and accused CBS News of editing the interview in order to \"tip the scales [of the election] in favor of the Democratic party.\"\n\n Paramount eventually opted to settle the case and agreed to pay Trump $16 million in July. Critics including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and the Writers Guild of America East viewed the decision as an attempt to appease Trump in the midst of the company's then-pending merger with Skydance, which required approval from the Trump administration. The deal was approved later that month, and closed on Aug. 7.\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n Paramount also came under fire for canceling The Late Show With Stephen Colbert three days after the show criticized the CBS News-Trump settlement. Warren suggested that the show was canceled for \"political reasons\" related to the settlement, though the network has consistently stated that pulling the plug on the show was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.\"\n\n Additionally, in April, The New York Times reported that longtime 60 Minutes producer Bill Owens resigned from the show.","summary":"Noem criticized the network for editing four minutes out of a 16-minute interview.","url":"https://ew.com/kristi-noem-interview-cbs-news-changes-rules-face-the-nation-11804845","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/OQ318NBMDI4x6mbMnJBN4B5Iuyg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kristi-Noem-face-the-nation-801-090525-a0ff496b60894020b0a09bf91c800050.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-06 00:49:41","author":"Wesley Stenzel","authors":["Wesley Stenzel"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.025},{"id":357842286,"title":"Joseph McNeil, who helped spark a protest movement at a Greensboro lunch counter, dies at 83","text":"GREENSBORO, N.C. -- Joseph McNeil, one of four North Carolina college students whose occupation of a racially segregated Woolworth's lunch counter 65 years ago helped spark nonviolent civil rights sit-in protests across the South, died Thursday, his university said.

The most recent data from 2020 says at least 20 planes make up the executive fleet. A newly constructed plane has not been added in nearly 27 years. Some of the ones currently in service are expected to stay flying for another 13 years. \"They're not building the plane fast enough. I mean, they're actually in default,\" Trump said about Boeing in a February interview with Sean Hannity. Air Force One is used to designate any Air Force aircraft carrying the commander in chief. There are currently two highly customized Boeing aircraft that were deployed in 1990 when George H.W. Bush was president. The planes have since carried Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Trump, Joe Biden and now Trump once again. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO: THE QATAR AIR FORCE ONE JET \"I miss Air Force One,\" Bush said at an event for Veterans in 2014. \"In eight years, they never lost my baggage.\" The two forthcoming Boeing planes have been plagued by delays due to the complex technology needed onboard Air Force One. \"They've got to debug it, make sure there's no signals intelligence risks. And I think just to make it secure against any potential military attacks. It was ironic for a long time. It was one of the Prince's planes, which I think they were trying to sell. And now they're giving it to the U.S., and it's costing quite a bit to update,\" staff writer for the Free Press Jay Solomon said. The Qatari jet is estimated to have a faster timeline than the two Boeing planes, but it still needs some of the same technology to make it Air Force One. \"If you look at it just through economics, maybe it makes sense, but I still think the fact that we're allowing a foreign country to gift something of that magnitude to a sitting president on top of all these other concerns,\" Soloman said. \"I think it's a risk, and it's not a good look.\" Air Force One is required to have four engines, unlike most of today’s passenger planes which have two. Onboard is the highest level of classified communications and external protections against foreign surveillance. The planes are equipped with air-to-air refueling capabilities so they can fly for as long as is needed. Air Force One is built for the worst possible scenarios, like nuclear war, so that the president can still command military forces from the sky. \"They're extremely complex, and I'm not going to go into it, but they're not like a normal plane. You know, it's not like building a 747 normal,\" Trump said during his Middle East Trip on \"Special Report\" in May. TRUMP ACCEPTS JET FROM QATAR, WILL REFIT TO SERVE AS AIR FORCE ONE, DOD SAYS Air Force officials say it is possible to add some of the security features to the Qatari jet, but it's unlikely to have the full suite of technology by Trump's February timeline. \"Initially it was supposed to be like, maybe he'll get it done by the end of his presidency,\" Solomon said. Four modified Boeing 757s or C-32As are the newest planes in the executive fleet. Those were added in 1998 and 1999. The Air Force is studying potential replacement options, but the current planes will continue to fly until 2038. The aircraft are primarily used by the vice president, Cabinet members, members of Congress and other officials. \"Even today and regardless of the airplane, we have to operate it differently based on the threat environment that even the current or any of the future aircraft will go into. Again, can't talk in detail about that, but that is always a consideration,\" Air Force Secretary Troy Meink said during a June Senate Hearing. Air Force One isn’t the only aging plane; much of the executive fleet is more than two decades old. The aircraft have undergone modernization modifications, but officials have questioned the timeline for major updates as several incidents have taken place over the years. INSIDE AMERICA’S 6TH-GEN ARSENAL: B-21, F-47, AND THE FUTURE OF AIR DOMINANCE In 2014, Obama was forced to switch planes during a campaign event in Philadelphia after a minor mechanical problem was reported on Air Force One. In 2021, Vice President Kamala Harris' plane requested an emergency return to Joint Base Andrews as she began her first foreign trip overseas to Guatemala and Mexico. Most recently, Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s plane was forced to turn around while en route to Munich in February, after a mechanical issue.

Biden first rode in the newly designed Marine One in 2024 during the Democratic National Convention. Updating those took nearly two decades and in some cases replaced helicopters flying since the 1970s. The Boeing 777X is expected to be the next new major commercial aircraft. It’s scheduled to enter service in 2026 after a nearly six-year delay with Lufthansa taking the first flight. The modernized plane is designed to have a folding wingtip, a touchscreen flight deck and wider cabin space.","summary":"Air Force One fleet faces aging aircraft issues as Boeing delays delivery of new presidential planes by years, prompting consideration of a Qatari jet alternative.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/closer-look-air-force-one-executive-fleet","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/09/donald-trump-air-force-one.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6378547597112","publish_date":"2025-09-05 23:11:42","author":"Amy Munneke,Bret Baier","authors":["Amy Munneke","Bret Baier"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.342},{"id":357839454,"title":"Joseph McNeil dies at 83; civil rights activist helped spark a protest movement at a North Carolina lunch counter","text":"By Gary D.

German authorities have characterized the deaths as coincidental—resulting from natural causes, pre-existing conditions, or not disclosed for privacy reasons—asserting no signs of foul play. However, the context of these occurrences, set in a political environment where the AfD is deemed an extremist threat by the establishment, makes them seem anything but coincidental. Skeptics highlight the statistical anomaly: Seven deaths among around 3,000 candidates, primarily focusing on one anti-establishment party ascending in the polls.\n\nThe AfD stands firm against globalist agendas: advocating for reinforced borders to curb unregulated migration, halting boundless aid to Ukraine’s ongoing conflict, restarting nuclear reactors closed due to environmental policies, and terminating wind energy projects that have disrupted industries and increased energy expenses. These are not fringe opinions; they challenge the EU-Brussels consensus that prioritizes open borders and interventionist policies over national concerns.\n\nAccording to BBC reports, which detail the deaths and logistical issues like reprinting ballots in affected districts, authorities emphasize the incidents are legitimate and above suspicion. The Hungarian Conservative examines one case, underscoring a prompt non-criminal verdict despite the suspect context. Yet, as the AfD attempts to triple its vote share in NRW—testing their strength post-federal elections—these occurrences disrupt operations and spark questions. This situation is reminiscent of cartel-driven assassinations in Mexico’s 2024 elections, where dissenting voices were silenced. Independent journalists raise serious concerns, pondering if voicing opposition carries lethal risks.\n\nDetails from Main Sources\n\nThe deaths transpired in NRW, where the AfD put forward over 3,000 candidates for the September 14 local elections. Authorities claim no links between the cases, citing natural or personal causes without external involvement. Here’s a factual summary sourced from available reports:\n\nRalph Lange, age 66 or 67, location unspecified in NRW: Sudden and unexpected death, ruled natural causes.\nWolfgang Seitz, age 59, location unspecified: Sudden death, official cause natural.\nWolfgang Klinger, age 71 or 72, location unspecified: Unexpected natural causes.\nStefan Berendes, age not detailed (likely mid-50s to 60s based on patterns), location unspecified: Sudden death, natural.\nRené Herford, age not specified, reserve candidate: Died of kidney failure following a pre-existing liver condition.\nPatrick Tietze, age not specified, reserve: Reported suicide.\nHans-Joachim Kind, age 80, from Kremenholl in southern Remscheid: Natural causes after a long illness.\n\nThese incidents occurred from late August to early September 2025, with the first four announced around September 1, followed by two alternates and the seventh shortly afterwards. While some involved older individuals or those with known health problems, critics note that several—such as Seitz, aged 59—weren’t elderly or previously sick, challenging easy rationalizations.\n\nThe BBC offers additional context: Police investigated the initial four deaths and found no foul play, mentioning similar fatalities in other parties (six involving the Greens and Social Democrats post-nomination). Though the AfD’s grouping is noteworthy, particularly as the party—labeled right-wing extremist by domestic intelligence—gains traction in western Germany. Polls predict a leap to 16-17% in NRW, a significant increase from 5.4% in the 2022 state elections. Skepticism in German media, including Welt, mirrors online discussions, with AfD co-leader Alice Weidel endorsing claims of statistical improbability. The outlet acknowledges no evidence connecting the deaths but recognizes the peculiarity.\n\nThe Hungarian Conservative focuses on Kind’s case, detailing how authorities quickly ruled it non-criminal, emphasizing his long illness as explanation. Deputy AfD chairman Kay Gottschalk urged probes but warned against conspiracy theories, respecting families. The piece notes the deaths exceed norms—seven among 250 key candidates in weeks—and highlights AfD’s surveillance by intelligence services, adding tension. No direct ties to threats, but the pattern benefits establishment parties like the ruling coalition, which could retain control amid disruptions.\n\nElection fallout is real: Ballots must be reprinted in impacted areas, postal votes recast, creating “immense chaos” per reports. This could suppress turnout or delay results, favoring incumbents in a state of 18 million where AfD’s anti-migration stance resonates. While officials downplay, the concentration raises questions about whether these “natural” ends conveniently sideline challengers.\n\nParallel to Mexico’s Elections\n\nThe AfD’s string of deaths draws stark parallels to Mexico’s 2024 elections, where a record 38 candidates were assassinated in the bloodiest campaign on record. Reuters detailed how violence, largely tied to drug cartels, targeted local politicians—often opposition figures—leading up to the June vote. The final tally included 37 murders, with the last, Jorge Huerta Cabrera in Puebla, shot at a rally. Government efforts to protect 560 candidates fell short amid 828 non-lethal aggressions, and officials often minimized patterns as isolated incidents.\n\nSimilarities abound: In both, anti-establishment voices face elimination before polls, with authorities downplaying systemic threats. Mexico’s killings served cartel interests intertwined with global drug networks and porous borders—much like how Germany’s open migration policies benefit elite agendas. Opposition platforms were hit hardest, echoing AfD’s border-sealing push against mass influxes. Official responses in Mexico echoed Germany’s: Blame coincidences or personal issues, not foul play. The facts imply a pattern: Neutralize dissent to preserve the system, whether via bullets in cartel-riddled Mexico or “sudden” ends in surveillance-heavy Germany.\n\nIndependent Analysis: Redacted’s Reporting\n\nOn Redacted, hosts Clayton and Natalie Morris dissected the AfD deaths with German journalist Naomi Seibt, offering a raw counter to mainstream gloss-overs. Clayton kicked off: “Seven members of the German right-wing AfD party suddenly dropped dead… German authorities say these are just coincidental non-criminal deaths.” He tied it to the party’s anti-globalist bent—sealing borders, ending Ukraine aid, restarting nuclear, ditching green schemes—right before elections.\n\nSeibt called the timing “very off,” rejecting legacy media’s “conspiracy theories” label: “Seven AfD candidates within the span of a few weeks. Something is very off here.” She dismissed pre-existing conditions excuses, noting even if some were 60-plus, the cluster doesn’t add up: “If I maybe eat one Big Mac today and then I drop dead tomorrow, that means I had a pre-existing condition?” Comparing to COVID stats abuse, she argued these deaths are “way more unexpected” than manipulated pandemic figures.\n\nOn AfD’s rise, Seibt said they were “definitely headed for a win,” though not superstar candidates. Leaders like Alice Weidel face death threats—canceling events over bomb fears—making the party a prime target: “Why didn’t nobody try to kill somebody like Kamala Harris? That’s because obviously she was not as much of a target.” Strategic hits on lesser-knowns avoid backlash while disrupting.\n\nSeibt dissected rumors, like a syringe incident causing illness: “That’s not normal, that’s not a natural cause.” She urged investigations, respectfully, as crucial: “At the very least investigate what’s actually going on.” As gaslighting example, she detailed 16-year-old Ukrainian Liana’s murder—pushed onto tracks by Iraqi migrants—but initially called an accident. Media smeared AfD probes as racist until truth emerged: “They tried to brainwash every single one of us.”\n\nSeibt revealed intelligence surveillance on AfD, wiretapping phones, raiding homes—including herself on watch lists: “It’s worse than what we’ve lived through in East Germany,” per survivors. Natalie questioned government credibility, citing the Navalny poisoning fabrication: “They made up this crazy circumstance… to vilify Putin.” Now, they’re “ignoring suspicious circumstances.” Seibt agreed: “I don’t care what the government says,” pushing for oversight like family access. She feared escalations: With raids on AfD’s Peter Bystron over baseless Russia claims and candidate bans, “maybe they will resort to different tools and potentially even consider killing them silently.”\n\nClayton probed locales’ strategic value: Pivotal for AfD majorities? Seibt noted early days but gains in key areas, warning more could follow if bans fail.\n\nWhat They’re Saying on X\n\nNaomi Seibt: “🚨🇩🇪 7 AfD MEMBERS JUST DlED – ALICE WEIDEL WARNED US‼️😳 AfD candidates are the targets of intelligence espionage, lawfare, hoax trials, election bans. Tyranny has kiIIed democracy. And now… AfD candidates too? Do you believe it was a coincidence?” Her post ties deaths to systemic attacks, urging scrutiny amid AfD threats. \nPunishable Press: “”Statistically Impossible” 7 AFD candidates die before local elections in Germany.” The account highlights improbability, with a video fueling discussions on patterns and media silence. \nDisclose.tv: “NEW – AfD party has recorded six deaths among its politicians within a short period of time in the run-up to the upcoming local elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany — Welt” with update: “UPDATE – Number of deceased AfD candidates rises to seven — Welt.” Their neutral reporting sparks replies comparing to Mexico and accusing foul play.\n\nUnanswered questions linger: Why only AfD in this death wave? Why no deeper probes? Despite surveillance and smears, the party endures, embodying populist grit against elite pressures. Transparent investigations are vital—no lectures, just accountability.\n\nIn a time of globalist wars siphoning resources and borders erased for cheap labor, AfD’s push for sovereignty threatens the machine. That’s why they’re targeted: Real change gets crushed to sustain interventions and open societies. Ditch legacy media; track independents for unvarnished truth.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWeeks before local elections in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany’s most populous state,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Unexplained Deaths of AfD Candidates Prior to Local Elections first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/unexplained-deaths-of-afd-candidates-prior-to-local-elections/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Mysterious-Deaths-of-AfD-Candidates-Before-Local-Elections.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-05 21:11:06","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.301},{"id":357838324,"title":"Trump’s New Labor Stats Guy is a Jan 6 ‘Bystander’ Accused of Unhinged Posts","text":"President Trump recently fired Erika McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, accusing her of having “rigged” job reports. In her place, Trump has selected E.J. Antoni, a former Heritage Foundation economist who was photographed at the January 6th debacle (but who claims he was just a “bystander” to the chaos) and who, according to reports from CNN and Wired, formerly ran a Twitter account that posted all sorts of gnarly stuff.\n\nEarlier this month, Wired reported that a since-deleted Twitter account with the same name as Antoni (it went by “Dr. Erwin J. Antoni III”) had posted a flurry of tweets that displayed a “seeming obsession with promoting election denial conspiracy theories while talking about violent threats to those who stood in Trump’s way.” Wired also noted that the account posted “violent religious rhetoric” and, before the Capitol riot, “shared content from The Donald, a virulently pro-Trump message board that was used to organize the events of Jan 6, 2021.” The account is characterized as having been “infused with a deeply hardline Catholic worldview, [and] at times displayed misogyny and a knowledge of Nazi military techniques.”\n\nSurveillance footage has definitively confirmed that Antoni was at the January 6th riots. The White House previously defended Antoni’s presence, claiming he was “a bystander to the events of January 6th, observing and then leaving the Capitol area.” The White House also previously noted: “EJ was in town for meetings, and it is wrong and defamatory to suggest EJ engaged in anything inappropriate or illegal.” There’s no evidence Antoni entered the Capitol, and the footage available shows him milling through the crowd and, eventually, leaving the grounds, NBC reports.\n\nCNN now has a new report out about Antoni’s alleged Twitter account that states he posted degrading sexual content about Kamala Harris, apparently implying that her political career was the result of blowjobs:\n\nIn 2019, the since-deleted account known as “ErwinJohnAntoni” changed its username to “phdofbombsaway.” The account posted at least five sexually suggestive tweets implying that then Sen. Kamala Harris had advanced her career through sexual favors. Shortly after Harris ended her 2020 presidential campaign, Antoni wrote, “You can’t run a race on your knees,” in response to a tweet of a doctored campaign poster that depicted a sexually explicit image of Harris. Antoni also referred to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, as “Miss Piggy.” In February 2020, he retweeted a post titled “Advice For Women: How To Land a Great Guy,” which instructed women to “be in shape,” “grow your hair long,” “be sweet,” “learn to cook,” and “don’t be annoying.” The post concluded: “Angry feminists and simps will try to sabotage you in the comments. Don’t listen to them. Listen to me.”\n\nSuch sweet advice from “ErwinJohn”—jeez any woman would be lucky to have a classy guy like that. The same account reportedly used the handle “Dr. Curtis LeMay,” in apparent reference to the U.S. Air Force’s notoriously psychotic general who oversaw the bombing of Japan in WWII.\n\nWhen reached for comment, the White House didn’t address the allegations about past social media posts, merely providing the following statement from spokeswoman Taylor Rogers:\n\n“The BLS was failing America’s businesses, policymakers, and families by publishing jobs reports with vastly inaccurate data. This has gone on for years without any real attempt at resolution while Wall Street and Main Street’s frustration with the BLS continued to grow. President Trump has nominated Dr. EJ Antoni to fix the issues at the BLS and restore trust in the jobs reports. Dr. Antoni has the experience and credentials needed to restore solution-oriented leadership at the BLS — solutions that will prioritize increasing survey response rates and modernizing data collection methods to improve the BLS’s accuracy.”\n\nGizmodo also reached out to the Labor Department and the Heritage Foundation for comment.\n\nIt’s no wonder that Trump wants someone with a different perspective to report on the economy right now. Many analysts see a slowly unraveling fiscal outlook with America’s jobs market in free fall. The Bureau of Labor Statistics report published on Friday showed that hiring in the U.S. had stalled, with just 22,000 jobs added in August. That’s significantly lower than what analysts had projected, which was some 80,000 jobs, the Associated Press notes. Some commentators feel that it is Trump’s policies—in particular, his tariffs—that have rattled companies and kept their hiring practices conservative.","summary":"Two different reports claim Trump's new labor statistics guru ran a social media account that routinely posted bigoted content.","url":"https://gizmodo.com/trumps-new-labor-stats-nominee-was-a-jan-6-bystander-accused-of-making-unhinged-posts-2000654659","image":"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Trump-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-05 21:05:16","author":"Lucas Ropek","authors":["Lucas Ropek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.248},{"id":357839628,"title":"Trump-Supporting Muslim Mayor Halts English/Arabic Police Department Patch","text":"The mayor of Dearborn Heights, Michigan, said the Detroit suburb’s police department jumped the gun on posting a mockup of an optional patch in English and Arabic three days ago, explaining it should never have been presented as official.\n\nThe Dearborn Heights Police Department announced in a Facebook post earlier this week it was going to be offering its officers the optional patch that had “Dearborn Heights” and “Police” written in both languages — believed to be the first of its kind in the country.\n\nBut that post has now been removed, with Dearborn Heights Mayor Bill Bazzi — nominated by President Trump to a North African ambassadorship — saying not so fast on the proposed alteration to the local police uniform.\n\nIt was not “put forth for consensus for further review,” Detroit’s Fox affiliate quotes the mayor as saying.\n\n“Should efforts like this be formally undertaken to make any changes to the Police uniform, it is our goal to include multiple PD stakeholders for a larger conversation, to ensure all are included in the discussion,” Bazzi said. “As we are one PD, each individual’s uniform represents the DHPD as a whole, and therefore merits the review and input of all.”\n\nThe police department wrote in its original statement on Facebook that the patch was designed by one of its officers, adding, “Our officers proudly serve all members of our community, and this new design is another way we continue to celebrate the rich cultures that make our city unique.”\n\nHowever, it should never have been offered as “an official prototype,” Bazzi, who was born in Lebanon and is the city’s first Muslim mayor, said.\n\nThe patch generated thousands of comments on Facebook, many of them in opposition, including one local man who posted, “we’ve lost the city.”\n\nDearborn Heights’ Middle Eastern and North African population was 39% as of 2023. In neighboring Dearborn that number is roughly 55%.\n\nPresident Donald Trump won both those cities in the 2024 election by eight and six-point margins over Vice President Kamala Harris. He actively sought out Arab and Muslim support while campaigning as a “peace candidate” in Michigan.\n\nOne of those who backed Trump was Mayor Bazzi, who the president earlier this year appointed as the United States ambassador to Tunisia, an Arab country with a population of some 12.3 million.\n\nBazzi just had his confirmation hearing in Washington Wednesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which now is expected to go to full Senate confirmation.\n\nBazzi, 62, is a classic American success story. He came to the U.S. at 12 from Lebanon with no formal education and went on to serve 21 years in the U.S. Marines, later earning aeronautical engineering degrees and working in positions for Boeing and Ford Motor Company.\n\nDespite the apparent mix-up over the patch, Bazzi told the local Fox affiliate he was proud of the police department’s efforts in the community.\n\nContributor Lowell Cauffiel is the best-selling author of Below the Line and nine other crime novels and nonfiction titles.

FACE THE NATION will now only broadcast live or live-to-tape interviews (subject to national security or legal restrictions). This extra measure means the television audience will see the full, unedited interview on CBS and we will continue our practice of posting full transcripts and the unedited video online,” CBS News said in a statement. (RELATED: CBS Quietly Edits Harris Word Salad Response In ’60 Minutes’ Interview)\n\nNoem accused CBS News on Sunday of having “shamefully edited” her interview to “whitewash the truth” about Garcia, an individual whom many Democrats and members of the media have staunchly defended. The DHS secretary referred to Garcia as a “known human smuggler, an MS-13 gang member, an individual who was a wife beater, and someone who was so perverted that he solicited nude photos from minors.”\n\n This morning, I joined CBS to report the facts about Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

Garcia illegally entered the U.S. in 2011 from El Salvador and has since been at the center of a highly contentious deportation case.\n\nCBS News’ change followed their $36 million settlement with President Donald Trump after he accused them of deceptively editing a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris to bolster her chances in the 2024 election. As part of the settlement, the network dedicated around $16 million to fund Trump’s future presidential library and agreed to release the written transcripts of future “60 Minutes” interviews with presidential candidates.\n\nThe administration facilitated Garcia’s return in June for him to face human smuggling charges. After being released and then immediately taken back into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an Obama-appointed federal judge in Maryland blocked the administration from deporting Garcia on Aug. 26.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

This memorandum provides a proposed update of prior Autopen guidelines that YOU approved during Transition.”\n\nThe document specifically lists “pardon letters” under the category of documents for which Biden should not use the autopen, “Documents for YOUR Consideration, Approval, and Original Hand Signature,” citing precedent set by former President Barack Obama.\n\nA second memo, circulated within the White House Counsel in February 2024, noted that by that point in Biden’s presidency, then-Vice President Kamala Harris and Counsel to the Vice President Erica Songer had become involved in the clemency approval process.\n\n“Before a decision memo is transmitted to the President, the Vice President has previously requested to review the petitioners individually and has raised detailed questions with the WHCO clemency team. This has also introduced significant, unexpected delays. Therefore, planning for the Vice President’s individual review of candidates would likely help expedite the process,” the memo reads. “Given the President’s schedule, it can often take days or weeks for the President to review and approve the clemency package. The Chief of Staff’s Office has been helpful in getting the paper in front of him for his review. He has previously asked the White House Counsel to discuss the candidates with him, although in the last round the Vice President’s approval was sufficient to obtain his approval.”\n\nOver the summer, President Donald Trump ordered that the White House Counsel pursue a separate investigation into Biden’s use of an autopen to sign thousands of clemency actions during his final weeks in office, including preemptive pardons for members of his family and several political allies.\n\nThe White House Counsel investigation follows separate lines of investigation opened by the Department of Justice and the House Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Trump White House and Biden’s post-presidential office did not return requests for comment on the aforementioned memos.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY), who is leading House Republicans’ investigation into Biden’s autopen pardons, told the Washington Examiner that these memos “reveal President Biden neither approved — nor may have even been consulted on — thousands of pardons.”\n\nThe Oversight Committee has been moving quickly through an investigation into Biden’s inner circle and how it enabled his use of the autopen. The committee has conducted 12 interviews thus far, with two more on the books, as it looks into whether Biden’s inner circle hid his alleged mental decline from the public by exercising presidential power in his name without his full understanding or consent.\n\nThe committee has expanded the investigation since the release of Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s book, Original Sin. Comer has questioned the former president’s use of the autopen for pardons and executive orders and whether his aides covered up his cognitive decline.\n\n“This is a historic scandal with massive repercussions. As President Biden declined, his aides carried out executive actions without his approval, casting doubt on the legitimacy of thousands of pardons and other executive actions,” Comer said. “The House Oversight Committee is in the final stages of its investigation. There must be accountability for this scandal.”\n\nThe government investigations into Biden’s autopen use were launched following the publication of a report from the Oversight Project, a watchdog group formerly part of the Heritage Foundation, that detailed how widespread Biden’s use of the autopen was.\n\nOversight Project chief counsel Kyle Brosnan told the Washington Examiner that the memos obtained by the Trump White House “confirm our fundamental thesis that President Biden was not running the country during his tenure in the White House.”\n\n“The pardon power rests solely with the President, and these new records show that the President was not the person exercising that power,” he continued. “They’re not legal pardons and should be thrown out.”","summary":"Former President Joe Biden’s senior staff initially recommended that he personally approve and sign by hand presidential clemency actions, but near the end of his term, Biden broke from that guidance, according to documents reportedly unearthed by a Trump White House investigation.

The surprise announcement comes on the heels of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accusing CBS News of editing her interview Sunday to \"whitewash the truth\" about an alleged MS-13 gang member. It also arrives months after the company settled President Donald Trump’s \"election interference\" lawsuit in July that accused CBS News of deceptive editing. \"In response to audience feedback over the past week, we have implemented a new policy for greater transparency in our interviews. ‘Face the Nation’ will now only broadcast live or live-to-tape interviews (subject to national security or legal restrictions). This extra measure means the television audience will see the full, unedited interview on CBS, and we will continue our practice of posting full transcripts and the unedited video online,\" a CBS News spokesperson told Fox News Digital. KRISTI NOEM ACCUSES CBS NEWS OF ‘SHAMEFULLY’ EDITING HER INTERVIEW ABOUT KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA On Sunday, Noem blasted CBS after her interview aired on \"Face the Nation.\" \"I joined CBS to report the facts about Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Instead, CBS shamefully edited the interview to whitewash the truth about this MS-13 gang member and the threat he poses to American public safety,\" Noem wrote alongside video clips to back up her point. In the clip that aired on television, Noem said, \"Prosecution decisions are always made by the Department of Justice and Pam Bondi’s department, so we will let them do that, although this individual does have criminal charges pending. He has charges pending against him civilly as well. And the one thing that we will continue to do is to make sure that he doesn’t walk free in the United States of America.\" The on-air portion edited out the rest of her answer and went to moderator Ed O’Keefe’s next question about whether the government would still seek to deport him to Uganda. Noem posted her \"uncut response\" online, noting it was excluded from the broadcast. The full interview, however, remained available on the show’s YouTube page. CBS NEWS INSIDERS BRACE FOR BARI WEISS AS PARAMOUNT CEO PUSHES DEAL WORTH UP TO $200M \"This individual was a known human smuggler, an MS-13 gang member, and an individual who is a wife beater, and someone who is so perverted that he solicited nude photos from minors and even his fellow human traffickers told him to knock it off. He was so sick in what he was doing and how he was treating small children. So, he needs to never be in the United States of America, and our administration is making sure we’re doing all that we can,\" Noem said. At the time, CBS insisted the process met the network's standards. \"Secretary Noem’s 'Face the Nation' interview was edited for time and met all CBS News standards,\" a CBS News spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Monday. PARAMOUNT, CBS FORCED TO PAY EIGHT FIGURES, CHANGE EDITORIAL POLICY IN SETTLEMENT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP As for the Trump settlement, the president was seeking $20 billion in his lawsuit against CBS over its handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing the network of election interference leading up to the 2024 contest. The lawsuit alleged CBS News edited an exchange Harris had with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker, who asked her why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't \"listening\" to the Biden administration. Harris was widely mocked for the \"word salad\" answer that aired in a preview clip of the interview on \"Face the Nation.\" However, when the same question aired during a primetime special on the network, Harris had a different, more concise response. Critics at the time accused CBS News of editing Harris' answer to shield the Democratic nominee from backlash leading up to Election Day. Trump agreed to receive $16 million upfront to cover legal fees, costs of the case, and contributions to his future presidential library or charitable causes. The president has said another allocation in the eight figures has been set aside for advertisements, public service announcements, or other similar transmissions, in support of conservative causes by the network in the future.

And nowhere is that more visible than in the collapse of legacy media’s stranglehold on American journalism.\n\nThe gatekeepers are in retreat.\n\nGone are the days of an adversarial press dictating the narrative to the American people.\n\nTaking their place are a legion of new and emboldened media outlets, social media influencers, and just about anyone with a smartphone and internet connection.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we’re witnessing a massive disruption in the media landscape.\n\nIt’s a beautiful thing to watch, and a hopeful sign that after years of playing defense, we’re now on offense—and winning.\n\nMany of the changes happening today were unthinkable prior to President Donald Trump’s return to the White House.\n\nThe Media Counterrevolution\n\nI liken it to what Victor Davis Hanson brilliantly describes as a counterrevolution—one in which President Trump is addressing the causes, not just the symptoms, of the progressive project.\n\nHanson calls this counterrevolution an effort to “erase the Left’s long march through our institutions.”\n\nThat long march went right through American newsrooms—just as it did in academia and Hollywood. Today’s legacy media is wholly owned and operated by the Left. They stifle conservative viewpoints—if they even give us any airtime.\n\nThis march began long ago, and it’s chronicled in detail by Batya Ungar-Sargon in her excellent book “Bad News: How Woke Media Is Undermining Democracy.”\n\nIt might be hard to believe now, but newsrooms were at one time staffed by blue-collar workers who lived among those they covered. They focused on stories of interest to their community, not to the affluent and elite.\n\nBut over the course of the 20th century, American journalism changed for the worse. It became an elite profession, one that catered primarily to liberals and advanced woke ideas.\n\nReporters and editors who might have in the past entered the workforce with a high school degree were replaced by esteemed journalists from elite Ivy League institutions.\n\nAs they rose through the ranks of newsrooms, they hired their friends and others just like them. Working-class journalists were weeded out in favor of people who had degrees from Columbia Journalism School or Medill.\n\nJournalism schools that at one time existed to teach students the trade became indoctrination factories for impressionable young minds.\n\nI know because I witnessed this firsthand as a journalism major in college. As a freshman, my Intro to Journalism professor began the very first class by advocating for an activist form of journalism—one that supported left-wing causes, of course.\n\nThis was a familiar pattern throughout my four years in journalism school. Even a course called Alternative Media focused on only one type of alternative—media catering to the far Left.\n\nThe message was clear: Think like one of us, and you’ll be rewarded with a successful career.\n\nGeneration after generation of students viewed media through this leftist lens. Today, these Gen Xers and Millennials populate newsrooms across America.\n\nSome are even leading the media companies that despise President Trump and seek to undermine the traditional American values we cherish.\n\nAnd yet despite this, I stand before you today with good news. Conservatives have successfully challenged the status quo—and we are succeeding.\n\nThe Collapse of Media Trust\n\nThe numbers tell a devastating story about legacy media’s credibility crisis. Here are just a few from Gallup:\n\nOnly 31% of Americans now trust the media “a great deal” or “a fair amount.”\n\nThirty-six percent have no trust at all—up from just 6% in 1972.\n\nAmong Republicans, a staggering 59% have zero trust in mass media.\n\nLegacy media have lost sight of their role of informing Americans in favor of lecturing them.\n\nAs a result, the gatekeepers have lost their gate and lost touch with the country, and at times, reality.\n\nFor years, a media monopoly of left-wing journalists occupied coveted spots in the White House, Pentagon, and on Capitol Hill—asking questions that advanced their agenda, often at the expense of the truth.\n\nTrump tried to disrupt things in his first term—but this time, he’s not backing down. And he’s doing so with committed warriors like press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr by his side.\n\nJust think about the remarkable changes we have witnessed this year.\n\nAfter years of hearing Republicans promise to defund PBS and NPR, it finally happened. The nearly 60-year-old Corporation for Public Broadcasting, funded with your tax dollars, announced it was shutting down.\n\nThe long-troubled U.S. Agency for Global Media, which is supposed to support freedom and democracy throughout the world but instead undermined American values, is a shell of its former self.\n\nWith those changes, the government finally exited the media business.\n\nIn the private sector, the counterrevolution is bringing changes unimaginable a year ago.\n\nStephen Colbert, the late-night host who spews nothing but hatred for President Trump, will be without a job after CBS canceled his show and permanently ended “The Late Show.”\n\nCBS’ new parent company, Skydance, made several eye-catching promises in its bid to acquire CBS’ parent company Paramount. These were outlined in letters sent to Chairman Carr in July. It would:\n\nUndertake a “comprehensive review of CBS.”\n\nEnsure that CBS’ reporting is “fair, unbiased, and fact-based.”\n\nRecognize the importance of “unbiased journalism.”\n\nEliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.\n\nCommit to a “diverse array of viewpoints.”\n\nFeature viewpoints from “across the political and ideological spectrum.”\n\nAnd have an ombudsman for two years.\n\nNow, it’ll be up to all of us to make sure those promises are fulfilled, but it’s still a remarkable admission to put in writing.\n\nAt MSNBC, Joy Reid lost her job and Rachel Maddow railed at her employer and then lost her staff to layoffs.\n\nLester Holt announced his retirement as anchor of NBC Nightly News.\n\nSenior National Correspondent Terry Moran went on a social media rant about White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller then found himself fired by ABC News. He then turned around and accused the network of “failing the American people” for not attacking President Trump more vigorously.\n\nWashington Post owner Jeff Bezos said the editorial page would focus on personal liberties and free markets, prompting editor David Shipley to quit on the spot. The Post lost 75,000 subscribers over that change alone.\n\nA few months later, notorious Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler left the paper, along with dozens of other longtime employees.\n\nThe Associated Press was barred from the Oval Office and Air Force One over its politicized stylebook and refusal to call the Gulf of America by its proper name.\n\nThe Pentagon replaced NBC News, The New York Times, NPR, and Politico in its press corridor with the New York Post, Breitbart News, One America News, and HuffPost.\n\nOn the flip side, Google’s YouTubeTV signed a multiyear deal to carry One America News.\n\nNewsmax started trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nFox News acquired Red Seat Ventures, which represents Tucker Carlson and other popular conservative hosts. A few months later, Fox struck a licensing deal with the popular conservative podcast Ruthless.\n\nI could certainly go on and on, but I’ll end my list with this—perhaps the most surprising news of all: ABC paid President Trump $15 million to settle a defamation case, CBS paid him $16 million to settle a lawsuit over Kamala Harris’ heavily edited “60 Minutes” interview, and Meta forked over $25 million after censoring the president’s social media accounts.\n\nYou’re hearing cries of self-censorship, complaints of a “fascist takeover,” and comparisons to “Kremlin suppression.” But the truth is simpler: They’re losing their power, and they can’t stand it.\n\nA Return to Common Sense\n\nSo how did this happen?\n\nFirst, we must give credit to our conservative forefathers. Without visionaries like William F. Buckley at National Review or M. Stanton Evans at the National Journalism Center, we wouldn’t have the infrastructure or the talent to challenge the Left.\n\nAnd without Rush Limbaugh starting his talk-radio show in the 1980s, Heritage Foundation President Ed Feulner helping to launch Townhall.com in the 1990s, or countless bloggers charting new frontiers in the 2000s, we wouldn’t be nearly as persuasive or influential as we are today.\n\nBut it took a fighter like Donald Trump to shake the establishment to its core.\n\nWhat Trump represents—and what we in conservative media represent—is a counterrevolution to restore normalcy and bring the country back from the far-left fringes. It’s a return to common sense.\n\nLet me rewind to the 2024 presidential campaign for a moment.\n\nDonald Trump set the tone for what you’re seeing now by skipping traditional stops at places like “60 Minutes.”\n\nInstead, he spent time golfing with pro golfer and YouTube influencer Bryson DeChambeau and hanging out with major YouTubers and podcasters Andrew Schulz, Theo Von, Logan Paul, and the guys from the “All-In Podcast.”\n\nAnd let’s not forget the granddaddy of them all, Joe Rogan, whose interview with Trump now sits at nearly 60 million views on YouTube alone.\n\nTrump did 14 of these podcast interviews, racking up a total of 124 million views by Election Day.\n\nMeanwhile, Kamala Harris did just five podcast interviews for a grand total of 4 million views.\n\nTrump bypassed the gatekeepers and spoke directly to the American people. They couldn’t distort his answers, splice his soundbites, or manipulate his words.\n\nAnd what happened? Americans saw a different side of Trump.\n\nConservative Media Rising\n\nToday, we’re living in a totally different world—and this is the moment conservative media has been waiting for.\n\nAn entire ecosystem of conservative outlets is challenging legacy media monopolies and shaping the narrative in Washington, D.C., and beyond.\n\nA few years ago, the White House Correspondents’ Association changed its membership rules to exclude outlets like The Daily Signal. Then Joe Biden’s White House revoked credentials for 442 reporters, including our correspondent.\n\nContrast that with the Trump White House. Karoline Leavitt upended the status quo when she added a “new media” seat that has featured a wide range of individuals who would have never found themselves in the White House briefing room under a different president.\n\nOn this very day, for example, my Daily Signal colleague Elizabeth Mitchell is serving as the White House new media pool reporter. Last week, she accompanied Vice President JD Vance on Air Force Two to Wisconsin and asked President Trump questions at his Cabinet meeting.\n\nWhite House Wire, an official government website and email newsletter from the Trump administration that curates news stories, featured in July alone articles from Breitbart, the Washington Times, Daily Wire, Daily Caller, Daily Signal, the Washington Examiner, and Blaze Media—all of which scored more links than the venerable New York Times, Associated Press, Bloomberg, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal.\n\nSeize This Moment\n\nThis democratization of news means Americans no longer depend on elites in Manhattan and Washington to set the agenda.\n\nToday, information flows rapidly on social media, unfiltered by traditional gatekeepers. Ordinary citizens equipped with smartphones capture and share newsworthy events, reaching their followers faster than traditional reporters.\n\nEach of you is part of the larger counterrevolution.\n\nAnd if we’re successful, this is an opportunity to build enduring media institutions that will rebuild trust in the role journalists play in a free society.\n\nWe won’t be gatekeepers. Instead, we will aim to give forgotten Americans a seat at the table in national debates about culture and policymaking.\n\nIt very much relates to the opportunity Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts spoke about at this National Conservatism Conference on Tuesday—it’s incumbent on us to build something better for future generations.\n\nAnd so, in conclusion, I want to suggest three practical steps:\n\nBecome citizen journalists yourselves. Use your social media platforms to share stories the legacy media won’t cover. Document what’s happening in your communities, your schools, your local government. You have the tools—now use them.\n\nSupport conservative media. Subscribe to our outlets. Share our content. Make small monthly donations. The Left has funded a media infrastructure for decades—we must do the same.\n\nTrain the next generation. Support programs that offer journalism internships or fellowships. Encourage young conservatives to pursue careers in media. We need a pipeline of talent to compete.\n\nAfter all, our counterrevolution needs warriors. We have the tools, the moment is right, and the stakes couldn’t be higher.\n\nThe question isn’t whether this transformation will continue—it’s whether we’ll seize this opportunity.\n\nAs one of my mentors, the late Ed Feulner would say—Onward!","summary":"Editor’s note: These are lightly edited remarks of a speech that Daily Signal President and Executive Editor Rob Bluey gave to the National Conservatism Conference...

The officers had originally been slated for crime-suppression work in the San Fernando Valley before their assignment changed, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\n“Pulling police officers from protecting everyday Angelenos to protect a failed presidential candidate who also happens to be a multi-millionaire, with multiple homes and who can easily afford to pay for her own security, is nuts,” the board of directors of the Los Angeles Police Protective League — which represents over 8,700 LAPD officers — told the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nThe board added that Democrat Mayor Karen Bass “should tell Governor Newsom that if he wants to curry favor with Ms. Harris and her donor base, then he should open up his own wallet because LA taxpayers should not be footing the bill for this ridiculousness.” (RELATED: We Watched Kamala Harris On Colbert So You Don’t Have To. It Was A Trainwreck)\n\nFormer vice presidents traditionally receive Secret Service protection for six months after leaving office, but former President Joe Biden signed an executive order shortly before leaving office that extended Harris’s protection to July of 2026. Trump reversed that order, ending her security detail as of Monday. \n\nNeither Bass nor Newsom’s office responded to the DCNF’s request for comment, and Harris could not be reached for comment. \n\nThe city is funding security for her while the former vice president is preparing to hire her own private security team, the Los Angeles Times reported. \n\nThis is not the first time Harris has leaned on LAPD protection.

Still, the move may invite fresh scrutiny every time producers invoke the “national security or legal restrictions” carve-out to cut material.\n\nNews of the change was first reported by Semafor.\n\nThe network insisted it would continue to post full transcripts and unedited video.\n\nThe abrupt shift followed Noem’s explosive charge that CBS “shamefully” cut her comments about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national she branded a violent MS-13 member and human smuggler.\n\nNoem, the former South Dakota governor tapped by President Donald Trump to lead DHS, blasted the network for trying to “cover up” Garcia’s record.\n\nShe released the raw interview herself online to show viewers what she said was missing.\n\nCBS pushed back, saying the trims were for time and stressing that full material was already publicly available. But the complaints snowballed, triggering fresh accusations from Republicans that the network manipulates interviews to protect Democrats.\n\nThe controversy came as part of a broader pattern of GOP anger at mainstream media.\n\nIn 2024, Trump himself took CBS and parent company Paramount to court over an edited “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe president accused the network of cutting a rambling answer about US influence over Israel to make Harris look sharper than she was.\n\nTrump filed a staggering $20 billion suit, alleging “deceptive editing” in violation of campaign fairness rules.\n\nAfter months of legal wrangling, the case settled for $16 million.\n\nParamount, which recently merged with Skydance Media, admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to publish unedited transcripts of future presidential candidate interviews.\n\nNoem seized on that history, arguing her case proved CBS hadn’t learned its lesson.\n\n“They have a pattern of hiding the truth when it doesn’t fit their narrative,” she told supporters after the flap erupted.\n\nThe new management team that now runs CBS News appears to be on the verge of instituting sweeping changes including massive layoffs as well as a new editorial direction.\n\nEarlier this week, the Puck news site reported that Bari Weiss, the former New York Times opinion page editor who went on to found The Free Press newsletter, was on the verge of coming aboard to take a senior editorial role at the Tiffany Network.\n\nAccording to Puck, David Ellison, the Skydance chief who took over Paramount after the two media giants completed their $8 billion merger, is prepared to pony up somewhere between $100 million and $200 million to acquire The Free Press.\n\nWeiss and Paramount have declined to comment.\n\nThe Post has sought comment from Noem and the Department of Homeland Security.","summary":"The network announced this week that its flagship Sunday show will now air only live or live-to-tape interviews.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/05/media/cbs-news-vows-to-air-only-uncut-interviews-on-face-the-nation-after-kristi-noem-uproar/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/kilmar-abrego-garcia-charged-two-110745697.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/i4sgLOsK-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-05 16:46:35","author":"Ariel Zilber","authors":["Ariel Zilber"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.509},{"id":357767064,"title":"Not Everything Trump Does Is a ‘Distraction’ From Jeffrey Epstein","text":"To hear Donald Trump’s critics tell it, all of the disquieting news that the president has generated this summer—the FBI raid on former National Security Adviser John Bolton’s home, the National Guard deployment in cities, Trump’s attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, his accusation that Barack Obama led a coup and committed “the crime of the century”—has been an effort to divert attention from the issue that truly terrifies Trump: the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\nIt has become the Democrats’ go-to exhortation: Trump is just doing this to distract you from Epstein. Do not fall for his grand scheme. In other words, America’s descent into authoritarianism is a mere deflection.\n\nNo doubt, the president’s past friendship with the late financier and accused sex trafficker is a legitimate problem for the White House. Trump has repeatedly tried to dismiss the matter, calling it “a Democrat hoax that never ends” as recently as Wednesday. But it has proved to be a rare Trump controversy that has shaken his otherwise steadfast base. His supporters were adamant during the 2024 campaign that Trump should release the Epstein files, and candidate Trump assured that he would. In February, Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed that Epstein’s client list was “sitting on my desk right now to review.” In fact, there was no such list, the Justice Department later announced. A MAGA mutiny ensued.\n\nDemocrats saw an opportunity and began accusing the president of creating all manner of diversions to steal attention from his Epstein entanglements. They have not stopped since, no matter how extraneous the scandal might be to the topic at hand—everything from ICE raids down to Trump’s demand that the Washington Commanders change their name back to the Redskins and his threats to revoke Rosie O’Donnell’s citizenship. You name the recent escapade, and some adversary has tried to dub it a ploy to distract from Epstein.\n\nUpon learning that Trump had canceled former Vice President Kamala Harris’s Secret Service protection last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer retaliated by slapping Trump with a clever nickname, “Epstein Don” (take that, Mr. President!), and said that Trump was “ready to put everyone he can in danger to distract you from how he’s hiding the Epstein files.”\n\nAfter Trump said that “CROOKED” Senator Adam Schiff should “be brought to justice,” the California Democrat accused Trump of “political retribution” and “retaliation,” in addition to “trying to distract from his Epstein-files problem.”\n\nSenator Patty Murray, a Democrat of Washington State, recently called Trump “a pathetic wannabe dictator” for sending federal agents and the National Guard into the District of Columbia. Murray claimed that he was trying to turn D.C. “into his personal police state” with a mission to—get this—“distract you from his connection to the Epstein files.”\n\nThis is a curious strategy. Clearly, Trump’s opponents think they have a killer weapon with Epstein and believe that they should deploy it whenever possible; polls show that large majorities of Americans are not buying Trump’s assertion that the Epstein story is a “hoax.” But Trump’s strongman tactics are a far greater danger to America than his proclivity to “distract,” which is a fairly standard political-communications practice.\n\nThe distraction drumbeat not only dilutes the seriousness of Trump’s actions; it also exemplifies the Democrats’ own lame efforts to communicate a potent opposition message. It would seem beside the point for them to divert the public’s attention from the things this president does that are truly devious, un-American, and totalitarian. (See: Obama, Barack, fake AI-generated video of Oval Office arrest.) By constantly warning citizens not to lose focus on Epstein, Democrats imply that Trump’s day-to-day abuses in office are mere stunts and can thus be safely ignored.\n\n“It’s so stupid. It drives me insane,” Dan Pfeiffer, a Pod Save America co-host and former senior adviser to President Obama, told me. Democrats’ overeagerness to “shoehorn” everything Trump does into some alleged Epstein cover-up looks forced and inauthentic, Pfeiffer added. “If all you have to say is ‘Don’t pay attention to this; pay attention to this other thing that polls better,’ you’re not actually motivating people.” Other fervent anti-Trumpers have expressed similar frustration. “I want to congratulate leading Democrats for their insistence on saying the takeover of DC is a ‘stunt’ or a ‘distraction,’” Bill Kristol, the editor at large of the center-right publication The Bulwark, wrote on X. “It’s a rare trifecta of intellectual failure, political stupidity, and moral obtuseness.”\n\nAnd yet, Democrats continue to hurl the magic words in response to seemingly every brazen thing Trump does. Maryland Governor Wes Moore recently found himself in a social-media beef with Trump over the president’s threat to send the National Guard into “out of control” and “crime-ridden” Baltimore. Trump also suggested that he might “rethink” the federal government’s funding for the repair of Baltimore’s “demolished” Francis Scott Key Bridge, which was toppled by a cargo ship last year. After more back-and-forth, Moore trotted out his big torpedo. “Trump is doing everything in his power to distract from the Epstein files,” the governor wrote on X. “Really makes you wonder…”\n\nActually, what this makes me wonder is if Democrats’ continuous invocations of the Epstein-distraction theory might reveal their own lack of imagination—and underscore their inability to find a more effective line of attack against a president who seems to be providing them with endless material. In fact, Democrats’ eagerness to call everything a distraction from Epstein might even be distracting them from discussing much bigger and more far-reaching vulnerabilities for Trump (his failure to bring down prices, as he’d promised; the Republicans’ massive and wildly unpopular reconciliation bill passed in July).\n\nWith Congress back in Washington after its summer recess, the Epstein story flared anew Wednesday morning when a group of his accusers held an emotional press conference outside the Capitol. “There is no hoax,” one Epstein survivor said. “The abuse was real.” The same morning, Trump was hosting Polish President Karol Nawrocki for a White House visit that featured a rare flyover of F-16s. A White House spokesperson said that the display was meant to honor a Polish army pilot who had died in a crash last month. But the spectacle also produced a long, loud roar over a large area of downtown Washington, which interrupted the victims’ testimony for several seconds—an actual distraction, in contrast to some of the Democrats’ more tortured claims.\n\n*Sources: Joe Raedle / Getty; Saul Loeb / AFP / Getty; Bill Clark / CQ / Roll Call; Alex Wong / Getty; Ethan Miller / Getty","summary":"Democrats need a better line of attack against the president.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/09/democrats-trump-jeffrey-epstein/684115/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/OU2BOivRodt5uYOXVN9t8r6oqrI=/0x0:4800x2700/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/09/2025_09_03_Trump_Epstein_Distraction/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-05 16:45:12","author":"Mark Leibovich","authors":["Mark Leibovich"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":357773024,"title":"New Docs Blow Open Biden Autopen Scandal, Put Spotlight On Kamala Harris","text":"Newly uncovered internal documents shed fresh light on former President Joe Biden’s use of the autopen and alleged outsourcing of decision-making during his final year in office.\n\nThe former president has insisted that he personally made all decisions regarding pardons, executive orders and proclamations, calling claims to the contrary “ridiculous and false.” However, internal memos and emails indicate that critical decisions — including clemencies — were quietly delegated to others, including former Vice President Kamala Harris, and it remains unclear whether Biden formally approved certain decisions, multiple outlets reported on Thursday.\n\nBiden aides initially insisted he personally sign by hand any official presidential actions. But by the end of his term, the standard had been abandoned, according to an internal memo obtained by Just the News.\n\n“Based on precedent from the Obama-Biden Administration regarding which documents generally are hand-signed by the President, our recommendation is that as a general rule, YOU personally approve and hand-sign all decisions that require Presidential action,” reads a February 2021 draft memo distributed to top White House officials. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Full Transcript: Daily Caller Interviews President Donald Trump)\n\nBy February 2024, authorization for clemency actions increasingly relied on Harris’ approval, according to a draft memo circulated by the White House Counsel’s office obtained by Just the News.\n\n“Given the President’s schedule, it can often take days or weeks for the President to review and approve the clemency package,” the lawyers’ memo reads. “The Chief of Staff’s office has been helpful in getting the paper in front of him for his review.”\n\n“He previously asked the White House Counsel to discuss the candidates with him, although in the last round the Vice President’s approval was sufficient to obtain his approval,” the lawyers noted.\n\nThe Trump White House concluded that this memo shows the former president was effectively “outsourcing” clemency decisions to Harris during his final year.\n\nDuring his four years in the White House, Biden granted 4,245 acts of clemency, more than any previous president on record, according to the Pew Research Center. All of Biden’s pardons from December to January — including those for family members, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Gen. Mark Milley — were reportedly signed by autopen, except for the preemptive pardon for his son Hunter.\n\nInternal emails cast further doubt on whether Biden approved the commutations of roughly 2,500 inmates jailed for crack cocaine offenses in January, the New York Post reported.\n\nOn Jan. 16, then-White House Staff Secretary Stef Feldman wrote to the West Wing lawyers requesting evidence that Biden had approved the commutations, according to emails obtained by the outlet. Then-Deputy White House Counsel Tyeesha Dixon forwarded the message to Michael Posada, chief of staff to the White House counsel’s office, for guidance.\n\n“Michael, thoughts on how to handle this?” Dixon asked, adding that the president “doesn’t review the warrants” in reference to the documents authorizing clemency.\n\nHowever, Posada’s response suggests that aides instead relied on then-Deputy Assistant to the President Rosa Po’s attestation of what the president “intended” to do, and it remains unclear whether Biden gave final authorization.\n\n“We will just need something from Rosa once the documents are ready confirming that the 21 people commuted to home confinement are who the president signed off on in the document titled X, and the # individuals listed in document titled Y are those with crack powder disparities who the president intended to commute,” Posada wrote.\n\n“Basically, something from Rosa making clear that the documents accurately reflect his decision. If you can give me a blurb whenever they are ready to suggest to Rosa, I can pass along,” Posada added.\n\nThe sentences of several individuals convicted of illegally possessing firearms, as well as two men whose actions resulted in the death of a police officer, were commuted as part of the sweeping action.\n\nThere were four meetings between December and January during which Biden was said to have given “verbal approval” for his wide-ranging clemency actions, according to Just the News. While retroactive emails indicate his presence, the National Archives had no staff notes confirming his attendance at the meetings or that he provided verbal approval.\n\nThe internal memos and emails were discovered as part of the Trump White House’s investigation into whether Biden aides “conspired to deceive the public about Biden’s mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President.”\n\nA former Biden White House staffer familiar with the pardon process denied that the president outsourced decision-making, according to the New York Post.\n\n“There is a concerted and willful blindness by Republicans when it comes to understanding how broad-based pardons work when they were issued by President Biden,” the source said, according to the outlet.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is installing a “Presidential Wall of Fame” in the Rose Garden and will be hanging a “Biden Autopen” portrait to mark the Biden presidency, he told the Daily Caller in an exclusive interview on Friday.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

At the time, Trump baselessly claimed that the “Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”\n\nThe latest jobs report found that the economy only added 22,000 jobs in August, meaning there are more unemployed people than there are jobs. The unemployment rate increased slightly from 4.2 percent to 4.3 percent, the highest figure since 2021. \n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) also revised down the numbers from June to show there was negative job growth for the first time since the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, as Bloomberg editor Joe Weisenthal noted.\n\nThe weak labor market is the culmination of Trump’s impulsive approach to economic policymaking. The president has repeatedly imposed new and shifting tariffs on imports from other countries, creating widespread economic uncertainty — at a time when Americans were already dealing with a brutal post-Covid economy and years of higher prices. (That brutal economy is exactly why Trump beat Kamala Harris last year.) \n\nFor the time being, as the monthly job reports underscore a Trump economy that is far from the golden age that his 2024 campaign had vowed to immediately unleash, a top administration-wide priority on this matter appears to be just blaming others for the Trump’s economy, and hoping that enough of the American public buys it.\n\nOne Trump administration official tells Rolling Stone that their office had pre-written different drafts of talking points for their principal: One version would blame BLS prominently for supposedly pumping out bad data; if the jobs report ended up being more positive for Trump, another version would downplay the BLS criticism or nix it entirely.\n\nFriday’s monthly jobs report was not positive for the president.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far\n\nThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time\n\nThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\n\n100 Best Movies of the 21st Century\n\n“Today’s disastrous jobs report makes it increasingly clear that President Trump’s economic agenda is wrecking the labor market,” progressive Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in a statement. She added: “There are now more unemployed people than job openings in the United States for the first time since the pandemic, Trump’s immigration policies are shrinking the workforce, and his chaotic tariffs are slowing down hiring.”\n\nInstead of immediately lashing out at the government’s statisticians on Friday, Trump took time to once again call his Jeffrey Epstein scandal “another Democrat HOAX.” He then quickly pivoted to criticizing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for refusing to lower interest rates. \n\n“Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell should have lowered rates long ago,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “As usual, he’s ‘Too Late!’” (Powell has slow-walked talk of lowering interest rates, taking a “wait and see” approach specifically because of Trump’s tariffs.) \n\nJob searching is bleak. Last year, a survey found that 36 percent of job listings were fake. Companies post fake listings to look like they are growing and farm data. \n\nThere are more hits coming. Health insurance premiums are expected to spike, and millions of Americans will lose their health coverage as a result of Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.” \n\nHealth care is the only field growing, adding 31,000 jobs — not exactly a positive given that America’s health care system is both hideously expensive for patients and maddeningly complex. \n\nRelated Content\n\nRepublican Candidate Takes Credit for Trump Immigration Raid at Hyundai Plant\n\nBlue State Governors Warn Trump May Use Military to Disrupt Elections\n\n‘The Robots Are Here’: Melania Trump and White House Officials Spout Gibberish About AI\n\nJudges, Juries Aren’t Buying Trump Admin’s D.C.

Dhe kjo thotë shumë për lidershipin e tij dhe përqendrimin tek inovacioni.”\n\nDikur, më të fuqishmit në botë ishin drejtuesit e bankave dhe bursave në Wall Street. Pas krizës ekonomike të vitit 2008, ky rol kaloi tek kompanitë e teknologjisë si Apple, Google, Facebook (Meta) dhe Microsoft.\n\nMbrëmjen e kaluar, drejtuesit e këtyre kompanive morën pjesë në një darkë në Shtëpinë e Bardhë, të vetëdijshëm se Trump do ta shfrytëzonte si mundësi për t’u lavdëruar.\n\nËshtë e habitshme të shohësh drejtues të cilët zakonisht janë afër ideve progresiste, të ulen pranë një presidenti konservator që po ndryshon mënyrën se si funksionon kapitalizmi në Amerikë, me më shumë ndërhyrje të shtetit.\n\nSundar Pichai, drejtuesi i Google, një kompani tradicionalisht pro-demokrate është dorëzuar përballë realitetit dhe mori pjesë në darkë, ndonëse me siklet. Pichai është me origjinë indiane, dhe India së fundmi u godit me tarifa të larta nga SHBA-të, jo sepse blen naftë nga Rusia (që edhe Kina e bën), por sepse kryeministri indian Narendra Modi nuk pranoi të mbështeste kandidaturën e Trump-it për Çmimin Nobel për Paqe.\n\nGjatë fjalës së tij, Trump ia “shpërbleu” praninë Pichai-t duke i kujtuar që shpëtoi nga një vendim i rëndë në gjyqin për monopol ndaj Google-it, duke lënë të kuptohej se ai vetë ndikoi që kompania të mos ndëshkohej rëndë. Pastaj iu drejtua Pichai-t: “E di që ishe në telashe për një nismë të administratës Biden…”. Edhe pse ishte e vërtetë që Biden rihapi çështjen antitrust, Trump harroi të përmendte se edhe administrata republikane kishte vazhduar ndjekjen e Google-it.\n\nNë darkën që fillimisht ishte planifikuar për inaugurimin e kopshtit të Shtëpisë së Bardhë (por u zhvendos brenda për shkak të shiut), Trump e kishte ulur në krahun e tij Mark Zuckerberg, drejtuesin e Facebook, të cilin vetëm një vit më parë e kishte kërcënuar me burg nëse përdorte rrjetet sociale për të ndihmuar Kamala Harris në fushatë.\n\nZuckerberg e kishte pranuar situatën dhe e kishte vizituar Trump-in menjëherë pas zgjedhjeve, dhe gjithashtu ishte i pranishëm në ceremoninë e nisjes së mandatit të ri presidencial.\n\nTrump, në mes të darkës, i tha: “Ky është fillimi i karrierës tënde politike”, gjë që e vuri Zuckerberg-un në siklet. Ai u përpoq ta mohojë me një buzëqeshje të zbehtë dhe tha: “Jo, nuk është kështu.” Më vonë, kur Trump kritikoi ligjet britanike për ndëshkimin e një gruaje që kishte nxitur dhunë kundër azilkërkuesve, Zuckerberg nuk dha një qëndrim të qartë duke thënë se nuk di shumë për këtë.\n\nDëshira për të marrë favore ose për të shmangur ndëshkime, i ka shtyrë këta drejtues të mëdhenj të teknologjisë të harrojnë krenarinë.\n\nNë darkë ishin edhe drejtori i IBM-së, Arvind Krishna, ajo e Oracle, Safra Katz, dhe vetë Bill Gates, që përfaqësonte Microsoft-in.\n\nTrump i “shpërbleu” me një koment: “Jam i lumtur që kam mbledhur përreth kësaj tavoline një grup njerëzish me koeficient inteligjence shumë të lartë.”\n\nKush mungoi\n\nDy mungesa të rëndësishme u vunë re: Elon Musk, i cili pas një përplasjeje të madhe me Trump, nuk i kanë të mira marrëdhëniet dhe tashmë sheh se si rivalët e tij Altman dhe Zuckerberg, janë më afër presidentit. Jensen Huang, drejtuesi i Nvidia, gjithashtu nuk ishte i pranishëm, por jo për arsye politike. Trump i ka lejuar së fundmi të shesë çipet e tij në Kinë, në këmbim të një përqindjeje nga fitimi. Por me fuqinë që ka Nvidia sot, Huang duket se nuk ka nevojë të jetë i pranishëm në darka të tilla, ai preferon takime personale me presidentin.","summary":"“Faleminderit që jeni një president që mbështet biznesin dhe inovacionin Është një ndryshim thelbësor që do të na mundësojë të ruajmë për një kohë të gjatë rolin udhëheqës në botë, gjë që nuk do të ndodhte pa lidershipin tuaj.” Këto ishin fjalët e Sam Altman, drejtuesit të OpenAI, gjatë një darke me Donald Trump-in.

That year, he lost by only three points to Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in a state that has long been blue but swung to the right in recent years.

A memo shared with the outlet cautioned Democrats against depending solely on the idea, long championed by conservatives but only recently discovered by liberal writers Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, that excessive regulation stifles growth in key areas like housing and infrastructure. (Subscribe to MR. RIGHT, a free weekly newsletter about modern masculinity)\n\n NEW: The “abundance” agenda is being challenged by Geoff Garin, @brianefallon, @ChrisForPA & @Groundwork, who argue econ populism is more electorally effective. They’re presenting polling to Hill staffers & Dem operatives this week, @ec_schneider scoops:https://t.co/dWQYJ2MpK3 — Sally Goldenberg (@SallyGold) September 4, 2025\n\nIn collaboration with the liberal think tank Groundwork Action, the research was reportedly conducted by Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, and strategist Brian Fallon, both of whom were involved in Kamala Harris’s campaign.\n\n“While there are elements of the Abundance agenda that have appeal, and the choice on which messages to deliver is not zero-sum, a populist economic approach better solves for Democrats’ challenges with working-class voters,” the memo states, according to Politico. “If candidates are asking which focus deserves topmost billing in Democrats’ campaign messaging, the answer is clear: though some voters believe excessive bureaucracy can be a problem, it ranks far behind other concerns and tackling it does not strike voters as a direct response to the problem of affordability.”\n\nThe memo argues that although a populist economics and “Abundance” ideas are not totally incompatible, Democrats should still lead with anti-corporate messaging, such as blaming price gouging for higher costs, not bloated bureaucracies and excessive red tape. According to a poll conducted by the group, around 66% of voters said the government’s tendency to cater to billionaires and large corporations was a more significant issue than bureaucratic inefficiencies, a concern for 37% of respondents. More voters also expressed a preference for measures targeting price gouging rather than reducing bureaucratic obstacles and regulations.\n\nDemocratic Pennsylvania Rep. Chris Deluzio joined Garin and Fallon in briefing Capitol Hill staffers and Democratic operatives about polling and focus group insights that support their argument. The group plans to present these findings to congressional Democrats in week or so, according to Politico.\n\nSome of the “Abundance” ideas from Klein and Thompson— again, some of which have long been supported by conservatives and libertarians — are actually good, and would help address the affordability crisis. Namely, slashing environmental red tape in order to build more homes. They also want a ton of green energy, better transportation, more money invested in scientific research and development, vertical farming, drone delivery and automated technology, lab-grown meat, and supersonic airplanes.\n\nDoes some of that sound good? Yes. Does some of it sound bad (and far too utopian)? Most certainly.\n\nUnfortunately for Democrats, they do not have any populist messenger as effective as Trump, who can sell a policy like cutting red tape to make things more affordable. He did it during his campaign in 2024, and although the cities themselves haven’t panned out so far, he even coined the term “Freedom Cities,” an idea that sounds quite a lot like the vision of “Abundance” liberals.\n\nDemocrats may copy Trump’s homework, but for them to pass the test in the coming Novembers, they will need their own version of Trump. They will need a figure who has the charisma and populist appeal, who can win over working-class voters, and in the same breath, make the case for policies that may not sound interesting in sound bites but are nonetheless extremely important.","summary":"'A populist economic approach better solves for Democrats' challenges'","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/09/05/democrats-donald-trump-populism-abundance-ezra-klein-derek-thompson-chris-deluzio-congress/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2228106448-scaled-e1757084114580.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-05 15:32:48","author":"John Loftus","authors":["John Loftus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.11},{"id":357736434,"title":"Trump’s nominee to lead BLS accused of trolling top Democrats with offensive Twitter account","text":"President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics once ran an offensive Twitter account that posted misogynistic and homophobic abuse and entertained conspiracy theories, according to a report.\n\nEJ Antoni, 37 – an economist with the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think-tank behind the Project 2025 agenda for Trump’s second term – ran the account from 2015 to 2020 but it has since been deleted, CNN reported. \n\nThe network said the account – which existed under multiple names at different times, beginning with his own – was used to make degrading and sexist remarks about female Democratic politicians, including Kamala Harris, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar.\n\nThe account was also reportedly used to make baseless allegations about left-leaning public figures, to subject gay TV news anchors like Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon to bigoted insults and to entertain conspiracy theories about Covid-19 and the 2020 presidential election.\n\nFavorite Trumpworld targets like the late Arizona Republican Sen.

No—It’s Much Worse.","text":"More ghastly, parallel-universe news this week. The man in charge of America’s public health said he didn’t know how many people died of Covid and added, despite his ignorance, that he is certain that the Covid vaccine has killed more people than Covid itself did (all this while he’s denying Americans access to the Covid vaccine). We committed a probable act of war against Venezuela. The president of the United States was mocked by the leaders of China, Russia, and India. And as of Friday, the Department of Defense is apparently going back to the future and becoming the Department of War, I guess because “defense” is too passive a cognomen for the real men of MAGA-land.But maybe the most ominous development of the week doesn’t concern the Trump administration at all. It’s the news that Bari Weiss is apparently about to become the head, or something, of CBS News. This is bad for CBS, sure. But it’s a lot bigger than that: It is the securing for the right wing of another key beachhead in the American media landscape, which, as I’ve warned repeatedly, will within a generation (or sooner) consist of a lot of large, noisy, avowedly right-wing outlets and a small handful of mainstream outlets that are too weak and feckless to defend what remains of our democracy—and will thus be acting as the handmaidens of their own destruction, if they aren’t already.This is certainly an “only in America” story, but I do not mean that in the normal, heroic sense. I mean it in the creepy, corporate, it’s-all-about-profit sense. CBS began life in 1927 as a radio network, expanding into television as that medium grew. It had entertainment and news divisions, and later sports; its news division was considered the best in the United States, and, along with the British Broadcasting Corporation, a model for mainstream media standards in democracies. It wasn’t being “liberal” when Edward R. Murrow helped take down Joe McCarthy. It was acting in defense of democracy against a sinister and dishonest demagogue.Over the decades—and this was a natural-enough progression—CBS became a huge corporation, expanding into movies, amusements, even musical instruments (it was said to have ruined Fender guitars for about 20 years, although today those guitars—I own one—are considered vintage, go figure). But even this wasn’t so horrible, until the age of megamergers brought on by what was essentially the end of antitrust enforcement in the U.S. Fade in, fade out: CBS formed Viacom, then they split, then they remerged. Paramount, which had owned part of CBS back in the 1930s, came back into the picture. In 2009, Paramount announced a partnership with this new thing called Skydance, which had been created in 2006 by David Ellison.In July 2024, Skydance and Paramount, now CBS’s parent, announced their intention to merge. You will recall what happened next. That fall, as the merger was under governmental review, and during the presidential campaign, 60 Minutes broadcast an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. With no evidence, Donald Trump charged that it was edited to make Harris look good. And so, exactly 70 years after CBS (and Murrow) took down one demagogue, it cowered and crumbled when confronted by another. The reason was obvious: Ellison and others wanted Trump’s Justice Department to approve the merger. In other words, profit was put ahead of the journalistic reputation of CBS News’s crown jewel program. CBS—actually, Paramount Global—decided to pay Trump $16 million (toward his “library”). It was an implicit admission that maybe Trump was right; that their most venerated news program perhaps was guilty of liberal bias, even though Trump never produced one lick of evidence that 60 Minutes had done anything wrong, anything that wasn’t part of standard broadcast practice. But Trump was clearly appeased, and, lo and behold, two months ago, the Trump administration approved the merger.On August 7, Ellison gave a press conference in New York, where he swore that no favors had been promised Trump. “We are not going to politicize anything today,” Ellison said. “We want to entertain first.” One can call Bari Weiss many things, but “apolitical” is not among them. She’s undoubtedly smart, and, with her wildly successful Substack publication The Free Press, she cunningly saw a market niche in identifying private-school wokery—rather than, say, the fact that one of our two major political parties is descending into fascism—as the gravest threat to the American way of life. I readily concede that what we call “wokeism” contains some excesses, some illiberal manifestations that run counter to the values of tolerance and open-minded debate. But the idea that students and administrators at a handful of universities are a bigger danger to democracy than Donald Trump and JD Vance and Pete Hegseth and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is absurd and dangerous. That is the view, however, of a certain slice of the American elite: wealthy people who tend to have gone to those schools, or who send their kids to them, and who, while not openly racist or sexist in most cases, nevertheless get the heebie-jeebies from all those Black and brown and trans people screaming about their rights—and who, more than anything else, in fact far more than anything else, want their tax cuts. And soon, CBS News will reflect their priorities and tell them the stories about the threats to the U.S. that they want to hear.In doing so, it will join not only Fox News and Newsmax and Sinclair, which increasingly controls local media. The Washington Post too appears to be traveling in that direction. In a few years, there just won’t be much mainstream media left.And I hate to say this, but that is partly their fault too. Weiss first became famous at The New York Times, when she expertly parlayed a hullabaloo over a controversial op-ed by GOP Senator Tom Cotton into a victimhood narrative about left-wing intolerance. She published a resignation letter that was praised by Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Donald Trump Jr., among others. All that attention led to her getting the funding to launch and grow The Free Press, for which David Ellison is now reportedly paying her at least $100 million, maybe more.An American success story, I suppose. But here’s the thing. The Times never should have been hiring someone like Weiss in the first place. She was at The Wall Street Journal editorial page before. Ask yourself: Has the Journal opinion page ever hired a liberal away from the Times? Maybe, although I can’t think of one. But in 2017, after Trump won, the Times hired both Weiss and Bret Stephens from the Journal. And at some point in there, the Times hired yet another young right-winger, Adam Rubenstein, who was the primary editor of the Cotton op-ed. Well, a Times defender would say, the liberal Times is more committed to diverse viewpoints than the conservative Journal, and that is a good thing. Up to a point, that’s true. And once upon a dear old time, a newspaper like the Times could hire, say, William Safire—hack and propagandist though he was—as an act of magnanimity to give a prominent platform to a conservative voice because conservative voices were indeed underrepresented in the media at the time. But that is hardly the case now. It brings to mind that old joke about some liberals being so open-minded that their brains start falling out of their ears.That open-mindedness, to circle us back to where we started, is on regular display at the Times these days, as I noted a month ago. The RFK Jr. Senate hearing Thursday was a shitshow. He obfuscated, he lied, he evaded, he humiliated himself. He is dismantling his agency and destroying public health. People will die because of his decisions, if they aren’t already. All of this was on horrid display Thursday.And the Times’ original headline on its account of the hearing? “A Defiant Kennedy Defends Vaccine Changes and C.D.C. Shakeup.” Great. Kennedy was savaged by senators of both parties for his lies and for shredding American public health to pieces, and the Times rewards him with the adjective “defiant.”Be assured that Bari Weiss’s CBS won’t be guilty of such equivocation in the name of “fairness.” That’s the difference, and that’s a big part of the reason why this democracy is dying.This article first appeared in Fighting Words, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by editor Michael Tomasky.

We focus most of our coverage on those things, and rightly so. But on one issue, he’s been a pretty standard Republican president, which is to say to say he’s been horrible and wicked in the standard way. The issue is guns. Before the Minneapolis shooting fades out of the news cycle, let’s look at the grisly Trump record, which has largely passed under the radar.We begin with his February 7 executive order called “Protecting Second Amendment Rights.” It stated in the opening paragraph: “Because it is foundational to maintaining all other rights held by Americans, the right to keep and bear arms must not be infringed.” It then directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to review existing laws and regulations and so on “to assess any ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens.” This has led to a process that seeks to restore the gun rights of convicted felons. And so, on July 18, the Justice Department published a rule to that effect. The press release’s opening sentence reads: “President Trump directed the Department of Justice to address the ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens—all of them.” Further down, the release quotes Ed Martin, the administration’s pardon attorney and a MAGA extremist whose nomination for a U.S. Attorney position was withdrawn because he probably couldn’t get the votes: “General Bondi’s support of the rebooted 925(c) program is consistent with President Donald J. Trump’s promise to the American people to support the beautiful Second Amendment.”So that’s number one: The DOJ is going out of its way to restore gun rights to convicted felons—a category, of course, that includes Donald Trump himself. But the EO and other actions by the administration go a lot farther. Trump ordered a review of every gun-regulating move made by the Biden administration. For example, on April 7, Bondi revoked a Biden-era rule that allowed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to rescind the licenses of gun dealers that break the law by falsifying records. Ponder that: Businesses that knowingly break the law now have immunity from federal oversight.There’s plenty more. On May 16, the administration agreed to a settlement of several lawsuits under which the Justice Department would no longer enforce machine-gun ban laws (which date to the 1930s) against guns with forced-reset trigger (FRT) devices. An FRT, which is a recently developed technology, allows the shooter to fire at an increased rate. The NRA and manufacturers say it’s no big deal, the shooter still has to fire each shot separately; gun-safety advocates counter that by mechanically resetting the trigger position after a shot is fired, FRT’s still dramatically increase the fire rate, essentially turning some semiautomatic weapons into machine guns. So these will now be sold again. FRT’s have been after-market devices, but now, they might be installed at point of sale.The Republicans’ big, ugly budget bill factors in here, too. A transfer tax on silencers has been part of U.S. law since 1934. The tax was imposed for the obvious reason that silencers tended to be used by the bad guys. You don’t need silencer to shoot a grouse or defend your family from an intruder. It was paid by either the buyer or seller and was set at $200. In all those decades, it was never raised ($200 then would be close to $4,900 today). But at least it existed. As of next January 1, it will be $0.This is who Trump is: a cynical and strictly transactional person who, once upon a time, spoke reasonably sensibly about guns, but who realized once he entered politics that anyone who wants the GOP presidential nomination has to sell his soul to the NRA, so he sold his (probably wasn’t expensive). This is another thing we kind of stopped paying attention to, because he does so many other things that are, or appear to be, so much more outrageous. But I take note every year of what Trump tells the NRA. In the summer of 2024, he spoke to the group in person and said, among other things:• “Let there be no doubt the survival of our Second Amendment is very much on the ballot. You know what they want to do. If they get in, our country’s going to be destroyed in so many ways. But the second Amendment will be … It’s under siege. But with me, they never get anywhere.” • “If the Biden regime gets four more years, they are coming for your guns, 100% certain. Crooked Joe has a 40-year record of trying to rip firearms out of the hands of law-abiding citizens.” • “They’re going after the ammunition. When the radical-left Democrats tried to use Covid to shut down gun sales during the China virus, I proudly designated gun and ammunition retailers as critical infrastructure so they couldn’t touch it.” This April, the group convened in Atlanta, and Trump addressed the assemblage via video, bragging about all the above and more, saying: “There is much more to come. Americans are born free, and under the Trump administration, we will live free—always live free. With me in the White House, your sacred rights will not be infringed.”Now, after Minneapolis, Vice President JD Vance and Melania Trump are out there trying to shift the topic from guns to mental health. It’s a total dodge, an attempt to talk about anything but guns; but okay, we have an obvious five-alarm mental healthcare crisis in this country, so to the extent that this administration really wants to do something about that—great. But as usual, the rhetoric is completely the opposite of the reality. The drastic Medicaid cuts in the big, ugly bill will impact mental health services in a vast array of ways. MindSite News, which covers mental health policy, wrote after the bill became law: “The previous five years—including the final year of Trump’s first presidency—had seen the renewal of a federal commitment to mental health. Over those years, federal funding for mental health services increased. New programs like the 988 hotline were created and funded. Funding streams were established to boost crisis response services and to support school-based mental health. Tough new health insurance regulations were enacted to improve access to coverage for mental health services.”That last point is especially key. Insurers don’t cover mental health the way they cover physical health (this, by the way, is an issue the Democrats should seize; mental health doesn’t interest the media much, but I guarantee you it is of keen interest to parents everywhere, of all political stripes). But this bill, the site notes, signals that “the days of a federal commitment to addressing the U.S. mental health crisis are essentially over.”So they’re even hypocrites on the one issue on which they’re showing “concern.” But let’s conclude by going back to gun policy.The guns purchased by the Minneapolis shooter were bought legally. Press accounts note this and then quickly move on, as if to say there’s no point in discussing gun laws here. But there is. There always is. Authorities haven’t revealed what kinds of guns, beyond saying there were three—a shotgun, a rifle, and a pistol. Maybe they’re not even in the categories of weapons we debate. I’d still like to know how someone with such obvious mental health issues passed the background checks. Minnesota strengthened its background check law under Governor Tim Walz in 2023, but someone somewhere still decided that Robin Westman could own guns responsibly, and we deserve to know more about who and why.In the meantime, Trump 2.0 so far shows every sign of doing anything the NRA wants it to do. They can offer all the thoughts and prayers they want, and they can prattle on about mental health until the sun sets. But it’s their actions that matter, and their actions say they’re perfectly content to let more children die.This article first appeared in Fighting Words, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by editor Michael Tomasky. Sign up hereLatest From PoliticsYou Think the Bari Weiss–CBS News Story Is Bad? No—It’s Much Worse.Most Recent PostYou may not know the name Lindsey Halligan. She’s not a scholar. Not a Ph.D. She hasn’t written any books on history. She has, however, worked as an insurance claims lawyer. Her most celebrated achievement, apparently, was defeating a 2019 claim seeking $500,000 in damages from her client over a damaged roof. How she managed to join Trump’s defense team remains unclear, but she was called to Mar-a-Lago the day the FBI came in with its warrant to collect those classified documents. Once on the team, she did what they all do, namely, grovel—she made an appearance on Steve Bannon’s podcast where she vowed to sue CNN for claiming that Trump was lying about the 2020 election results. Trump sought $475 million in damages in that case, but in July 2023, a federal judge dismissed it.Today, Halligan holds something few others in government probably do: a very fancy title that runs to a full 19 words (Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and the Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Staff Secretary). She is overseeing the … what’s the right word here? There are so many to choose from … “reimagining” of the Smithsonian Institution. That’s right. An insurance claims lawyer is now in charge of making sure that the Smithsonian’s 21 museums, 21 libraries, 14 research centers, one zoo, and 157 million items and artifacts are brought into line with the wishes of the Mad King.I see, looking back over them, that the tone of the above two paragraphs is a bit jocular. But this is no laughing matter. Forget Halligan. Maybe she’s smarter than I think, maybe she’s not. Maybe she’s a hardcore racist, maybe she’s not. But she’s not the point. The point here is Trump. He is not smarter than I think. I suspect he’s never read a history book in his life, and chances are pretty decent he’s never been to a museum, except to galas Ivana dragged him to back when. And about his hardcore racism, there is utterly no question.But we don’t talk about it enough. Trump long ago established to the satisfaction of everyone outside of MAGA world that he’s a racist to the bone. He and his father wouldn’t rent to Black people. He said those sick things about the defendants in the Central Park jogger case (they weren’t guilty). He said, “Laziness is a trait in Blacks.” He said some white supremacists in Charlottesville were “very fine people.” I could go on and on. Being long-established, Trump’s racism is not “news.” Regular readers of mine will know this is one of my longtime complaints about the nature and structure of the media. There are lots of things that aren’t “news,” per se, but are true, important, and defining of our reality. Trump’s racism is one of those things. It hovers over everything. It defines nearly everything he does. And it is making the United States of America a cruel, sick, mean place.His racism is what’s propelling this edict over the Smithsonian. “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was,” he whined Tuesday on Truth Social. When he talks this way, he’s sending a much broader message that is widely understood, by both his political foes and (especially) his supporters. Each group knows it’s part of a broader attack that is designed to keep certain Americans “in their place.” It’s just that the latter group approves.His racism is what’s driving the presence of these National Guard troops in Washington, D.C. His motorcade, traveling from the White House to his Virginia golf club, passes a small greensward along what’s called the E Street Expressway where there are (or were) a few tents, and that’s probably how he got his entire impression of D.C. crime, along with the background knowledge that D.C. is a heavily Black city (Black residents are no longer a majority, but still a plurality). The troops aren’t even fighting actual crime. They’re mostly around the National Mall, where it’s as safe as Mayberry in the 1960s. The troops are just a symbol for white MAGA world that he’s cracking some Black heads.His racism is behind this sick redistricting madness in Texas. Nonwhite people make up 60 percent of the state’s population. By the time the Texas legislature is finished, the Texas congressional delegation will likely be more than 70 percent white and Republican. In Missouri, the redistricting under consideration would slice a Black Democratic district in Kansas City into maybe three different pieces. Republicans have done this sort of thing long before Trump, but under Trump, of course, it’s being taken to extremes because Republicans now know that anti-Black extremism on such matters is the only thing that gets the boss’s attention.His racism is behind his talk about mail-in ballots and early voting and all his phony allegations about fraudulent voting. Everybody knows very well what, and whom, he’s talking about when he talks about such things. He means Black and, to a slightly lesser extent, Latino people.His racism is the fundamental reason for these mass detentions. Would Trump, and the right wing in general, be this worked up about illegal border crossings if it was mostly white people doing it? Of course they wouldn’t. There would be no rhetoric about immigrants “poisoning the blood” of the nation. Finally—although surely there’s more—it’s racism that animates a lot of his rhetorical attacks on individual Americans. It’s no accident that his recent targets prominently include Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King (her close friend), Beyoncé, Al Sharpton, Letitia James, and Charlamagne tha God. He goes after lots of people of all races, but Black people are disproportionately targeted, and it’s not an accident.I have no idea where Lindsey Halligan fits in here. She’s spent most of her adult life thinking about hurricanes. She’s interchangeable with any other Mar-a-Lago sycophant who happened to be in the right place at the right time. But the fact that Trump put someone in charge of remaking the Smithsonian who’s totally unqualified is what’s important here because it tells us that the person is there solely to follow his orders. Trump’s orders will be based on his worldview. And his worldview is the most blatantly and openly racist worldview that’s been held by an American president since Woodrow Wilson. We need to remember this—even, or especially, when the media forgets.This article first appeared in Fighting Words, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by editor Michael Tomasky. Sign up here.Most Recent PostRepublican Representative Bryan Steil thought it would be a good idea to go have a meetup with constituents Thursday night in Elkhorn, Wisconsin. Steil represents Paul Ryan’s old district and in fact used to work for Ryan. He’d had a rocky week: A few days before, some protesters plopped some flowers and a coffin on the doorstep of his Janesville home, an act meant to symbolize the ill effects of the Republicans’ big, ugly bill on the most vulnerable.Things didn’t get much better Thursday night. Steil was booed repeatedly, particularly on immigration, with one woman saying, with reference to Alligator Alcatraz: “The difference between a prison or a detention center and a concentration camp is due process.” Asked another, about ICE agents, to robust applause: “Why are they wearing masks, and why are they unidentified?” Congress is in recess now for the new month, so we can be sure that Steil’s fellow Republicans took note and will spend the month hiding from constituencies and hanging out at country clubs where tax cuts for the rich are popular and nobody needs Medicaid (or at least they think they don’t).Donald Trump, it is said, is frustrated. He wonders why he’s not more popular. He complains, we read, that he’s accomplished a great deal and that he’s keeping his campaign promises, and looked at a certain way, these statements are true, to a point. So he can’t figure out why he’s at 37 percent. I could tell him why. Two reasons, and they’re both obvious. First, his policies are horrible, and people don’t like them. If you’re “accomplishing” things that large majorities of people don’t want, do they count as accomplishments? Film director Uwe Boll somehow manages to keep making movies. But he’s a punch line. Most of his movies have been commercial flops and critical train wrecks—a career so lame that he once promised to quit the business if a petition demanding that he do so garnered a million signatures (alas, it fell short). That’s Trump: the Uwe Boll of policy.The recent polls have told us over and over and over. The big, ugly bill—unpopular. Rounding up poor guys hanging out at Home Depot looking for work—unpopular. Putting people in, yes, concentration camps—unpopular. Cutting his Palm Beach pals’ taxes—unpopular. Imposing these absurd tariffs—unpopular. I could go on. There is literally not a single important item on the Trump domestic agenda that polls well.Then there are the promises he’s broken. He said he’d lower prices on day one. Which, you’ll recall, was the same day on which he was going to end Russia’s war on Ukraine. And bring peace to the Middle East. It’s a pleasant surprise here lately that he’s talking smack about Putin and Netanyahu because they’re gumming up his glide path to the Nobel Peace Prize. But his criticisms don’t change the fact that the crises in both Ukraine and Gaza have gotten worse, not better, since he took office. Look, I’m glad that he’s flip-flopped on aid to Ukraine. But still, it’s a flip-flop. I remember when Republicans thought flip-flopping on a matter of war and peace was a sign of weakness.So that’s number one. He has either (1) executed his policies as promised, but people hate them, or (2) blown them off or reversed himself, exposing his campaign statements as nonsense. That the Harris campaign couldn’t figure out how to mock his obvious bullshit—don’t get me started. One thing I’m not celebrating this summer is Kamala Harris’s reemergence on the public stage, and I pray she’s not delusional enough to think she ought to run again in 2028.Number two is also simple. He’s a sleazeball, and more and more people are finally coming to realize it. The Jeffrey Epstein matter is Exhibit A, of course, but there is much more. The way he and his family are getting rich from the presidency is just obscene. Have you ever gone to TrumpStore.com? If not, have a look. It’s relentlessly garish, of course, but more than that, it’s relentlessly and proudly, defiantly overpriced. Yet these idiots buy this crap by the millions.But it’s Epstein that is catching up with him. And that story is a long, long way from being over. We cannot of course at this point state that Trump is guilty of anything. But allegations are out there. Have you read the testimony of “Katie Johnson”? You might want to familiarize yourself with it. Obviously, I have no idea whether it’s true. If a third of it is, and it’s ever corroborated, it will be by far the biggest presidential scandal of all time.And even if none of it is true, we’re still dealing with a president of the United States whose best friend for 15 years was a serial child rapist. Let that sink in. Again, why the Democrats couldn’t make this an issue last year—aarrgh. I know. I’m sure they have all kinds of reasons. But you know what? If Donald Trump were running against someone whose best friend for 15 years was a serial child rapist, he’d have made sure America knew. In any case, they’re figuring it out now. And if he pardons Ghislaine Maxwell or commutes her sentence or anything like that, millions of Americans will jump to the obvious conclusion.It all leaves Bryan Steil and his GOP congressional colleagues ducking their constituents, because God forbid they have to explain to voters why they voted for a sick bill that punishes working people and lines the pockets of the megarich and will shove many billions of dollars into the creation of a police state no one wants. That would be accountability, which would be uncomfortably close to democracy. Can’t have that.This article first appeared in Fighting Words, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by editor Michael Tomasky. Sign up here.Most Recent PostSo Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime abettor of dead pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, is meeting Friday for a second time with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. OK, first of all, let’s just stop right there. Why Blanche? Well, gosh, you say, he’s a deputy A.G.; seems legit. Actually, no, not by a long shot. Blanche was Trump’s personal defense attorney—on a sex case. (Technically, it was a hush-money case—the one involving adult film actress Stormy Daniels, which Blanche and Trump lost—but it was really about sex, in this case between consenting adults.)So, no—Blanche, whose actual job entails the day-to-day running of the department, is absolutely not the appropriate person for this task. Wait—let’s stop right there again. Is this “task” even legitimate? Under certain circumstances, it might be. Let’s say a mobster is in the can for some felony. Prosecutors believe he has information about a different crime. So they go to him to see if he’ll talk, and they offer him a deal.If that’s what’s going on here, maybe it’s OK—although alas, we stop again to ponder the morality of offering a deal to a child sex trafficker (hey, right wing, I thought this was a moral line in the sand for you?). This is not a mobster rat whose information could bring down another made man or even a whole family. This is a woman who was convicted of conspiring to groom minors for Epstein’s pleasure and who, according to at least one witness at her trial, participated in the sex.So the whole thing shouldn’t even be happening. She was tried, she was convicted, and that’s that. But: If it had to happen; if we are to concede that questioning her at this point is a legitimate enterprise, shouldn’t it be done by a line attorney who is familiar with the details of the case? Of course it should. Someone like, oh, Maurene Comey. Oh. Wait. They fired her last week.I hope you’re putting these puzzle pieces together with me as we go. The bottom line here is obvious. Donald Trump, I believe, wants to pardon Ghislaine Maxwell in exchange for her silence. Note I said wants to. He might not. A pardon would rip his base in two. He may grasp that and not do it.But I say there can be little question that he’s thinking about it. In fact, on the White House lawn Friday morning, a couple hours after I wrote this column, he was asked about a possible Maxwell pardon, and he said: “I’m allowed to do it.”I’m not the only one who smelled this possibility coming. Dave Aronberg, who worked as the Florida drug czar under U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi when she was the state attorney general, made some interesting comments on CNN the other day. First, he observed how weird it was that Blanche was conducting these interviews: “I can’t overstate it, Brianna [Keilar]. It’s as if the number two executive at CNN was conducting this interview with me instead of you. Like, what? It never happens.”Then he connected the political dots: “But there are others who could do this, which makes me believe this is a lot about perhaps some politics involved, like maybe to protect the president, to get a deal with Ghislaine Maxwell that she would get some immunity now and maybe a hidden pardon in the future, some sort of implication that she would be pardoned in the future if she comes out and says that the president was exonerated, not involved in any criminal activity.”Of course, we do not know whether Trump committed these heinous crimes. Like any American, he is entitled to the presumption of innocence. But the mere fact of these interviews being conducted the way they are raises certain obvious suspicions.Maxwell and her lawyers surely know all this. She has a lot of incentive, in other words, to say what Trump and Blanche want her to say. Oh, and by the way, let’s stop here again. Why should we believe a word she says? There is much-documented evidence of Maxwell showing a “significant pattern of dishonest conduct,” as Merrick Garland’s Justice Department put it in 2022. They spared her (and themselves, and their finite resources) a perjury trial because she’d already been convicted of the big stuff. Even assuming Trump is personally innocent, he still has a motive to cut a deal with Maxwell that leads to an eventual pardon. She might name prominent Democrats or other people to whom Trump is hostile. Her “pattern” suggests she’ll say anything Trump wants her to say.If you think Trump wouldn’t do this, that pardoning a child sex trafficker is a bridge too far even for Trump … honestly, wake up. I bet you also thought he’d never pardon 1,200 anti-American insurrectionists. If Trump is innocent, there’s one simple thing he should do. Order the release of all the Epstein files. Ah, but now we know that his name appears in them “multiple” times and that he lied earlier this month when asked about it. (The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Bondi told him about the multiple mentions of his name back in May.)How would MAGA world receive a possible pardon by their hero of a woman who did the things Maxwell did? Some percentage, maybe even a substantial percentage, would throw in the towel, finally. But I doubt a majority. They’ll find an excuse. Child rape is bad, sure, but it’s really only bad when Democrats do it. Trump was sent by Jesus, after all, and Jesus teaches us to forgive, so Trump’s joined-at-the-hip, 15-year friendship with Epstein was about as Jesus-like as you can get, right? The sad thing about that joke is that, if it’s ever revealed that Trump did unspeakable things, one of those sick “Christian” preachers will probably say this in all seriousness.The administration’s handling of the Epstein scandal and the likely coming indictment of Barack Obama, which I’ll write about next Monday, take us to depths we never, ever imagined we could reach in this country. Trump is the law, the law is Trump. I’ve always thought that, as horrible as everything is, if there’s an election in 2028 and the Democrat wins, we can get back to normal fairly quickly. As of this week, I’m not so sure.This article first appeared in Fighting Words, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by editor Michael Tomasky.

No—It’s Much Worse.Most Recent PostSo this is the thing about stories like the Jeffrey Epstein saga: There’s always new stuff waiting to come out. The explosive story that The Wall Street Journal dropped Thursday evening about Donald Trump’s alleged note to Epstein in a “birthday book” compiled for the child molester in 2003 by Ghislaine Maxwell was bound to come out. And if other things are out there about Trump’s history with Epstein—as there almost certainly are—they’re bound to become public someday, too.That’s the first reason Trump needs to be worried. Even if his name does not appear on some master list created by Epstein with a heading like “Good Friends of Mine Who Raped Underage Girls With Me,” it still has to be the case that there are emails, photographs, and other material that at the very least won’t look good. (I couldn’t help wondering what Maurene Comey, the sex crimes prosecutor in New York’s Southern District who was fired by Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday, knows about Epstein and Trump.)And here’s the second and more interesting reason. These cracks in the MAGA coalition right now are only that—cracks—but time may prove this week to have been a pivotal, even decisive, moment in MAGA history. On Monday, several voices in MAGA world (Charlie Kirk, Laura Ingraham, Megyn Kelly) were outraged over the administration declaring the Epstein matter closed. On Tuesday, a lot of those same voices said okay, nothing to see here, time to move on. Then, on Wednesday, they pivoted back to outrage, suggesting that on this one matter, social-media marching orders from Dear Leader could not staunch the blood flow. And Thursday night, the Journal story broke.We don’t know yet what the impact of the Journal story will be in MAGA world, though it seems to be rallying some of his Epstein critics to his defense. So it might be that the story allows Trump to play victim and blame the fake news. Trump denies that he wrote the greeting and, as usual, has vowed to sue, which means he’s suing none other than Rupert Murdoch, who quite interestingly—if Trump’s Thursday night rant on Truth Social is to be believed—turned down the chance to use his power to kill the story. Or it might edge some to start coming to grips with the fact that their hero is not the valiant knight they imagined him to be. To a certain kind of person who consumes a certain kind of media, Trump is a sea-green incorruptible: the man who quite literally risks his life (the two assassination attempts) to slay the debauched and ossified dragons that have been perverting America for decades and keeping the decent God-fearing people of “normal” America down.Now? As I said, we can’t make any conclusions just yet. But this is the week the pixie dust didn’t work. Maybe it’s a one-time thing. On the other hand, maybe it’s not. Before we get to all that, let’s do a quick deconstruction of what the Journal reported. There was a drawing of a naked woman (and why the Journal hasn’t posted an image of this thing is weird). Inside the drawing was a typewritten imagined dialogue between Trump and Epstein:Voice Over: There must be more to life than having everything.Donald: Yes, there is, but I won’t tell you what it is.Jeffrey: Nor will I, since I also know what it is. Donald: We have certain things in common, Jeffrey. Jeffrey: Yes, we do, come to think of it. Donald: Enigmas never age, have you noticed that? Jeffrey: As a matter of fact, it was clear to me the last time I saw you. Donald: A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.Obviously, the key line here is Trump saying “enigmas never age.” I have to say I give him credit for seeming to know what the word “enigma” means. In fact, the use of “enigma” is the one piece of evidence that suggests that maybe this wasn’t Trump!But “never age.” And Epstein replying that this fact was “clear to me the last time I saw you.” That’s clearly a reference to a specific event. If you want to believe it refers to that time they bought Girl Scout cookies together, be my guest.If this is a genuine article, well, it’s very rare in this life that things like that card exist in isolation. The two were joined at the hip for 15 years. There will almost certainly be new explosions in the coming weeks. They probably won’t emerge from the grand jury materials whose release Trump authorized in the wake of the Journal scoop. We can presume that material has been vetted to exculpate Trump. But maybe there were things that the grand jury didn’t see. As The Washington Post noted Friday morning, “the grand jury testimony would constitute only a fraction of the evidence amassed by federal authorities.”But back to that pixie dust. That’s the story here. Every single thing Trump has done for 10 years—every outrage against decency, every crime, every incitement to violence, all the rest—have been justified in MAGA world because Trump was doing all these things for them. And he was supposed to blow the lid off this whole Epstein thing for them, too. Instead, he’s covering up for himself. The order to Bondi about the grand jury material just looks like the kind of ass-covering bullshit move any politician would make. Members of the r/Conservative subreddit on Friday morning were definitely not appeased.Most of MAGA will continue to believe. Some people will need a photograph of Trump in flagrante delicto with a 12-year-old before they reconsider. And even then, they may insist the photo is fake.But others are already starting to question the whole enterprise. If Trump loses just 15 percent of his hard-core supporters, that’s huge; electorally, it’s potentially decisive. If we put his hard-shell supporters at 30 or 35 percent of the country, well, 15 percent of that is 4 or 5 percent. In a country this narrowly divided, that’s a lot to lose—a lot of midterm voters who decide the hell with it, I’m staying home.And finally, let’s not forget what this is about. Epstein did literally the sickest things a human being can do. Even if Trump didn’t do them, if he was that close to Epstein for that long, there’s roughly zero chance he didn’t know something. Is that what supposed Christians want in a president of the United States? Some of them are already wondering. As other shoes drop, more will.This article first appeared in Fighting Words, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by editor Michael Tomasky.

The Senate parliamentarian, combing through the details and determining which provisions will need a supermajority to pass, is hammering them. They’re locked in ferocious internal debate about the cuts to Medicaid. They haven’t held a single hearing on the bill in any committee.And they say they’re going to start voting on it tomorrow. Even worse is the complete hypocrisy of the thing, which has been true of every Republican tax bill going back to 1981. Ever since Arthur Laffer sold the GOP on his ridiculous curve, they’ve been lying to the American people about how their tax cuts will produce more revenue. It has never happened. Ever. Some of the dumber Republicans may believe this, but the smarter ones know Laffer’s theory is a lie, and they say it anyway. And so we watch as Senate Republicans argue about the degree to which they want to destroy Medicaid. You’ve been reading and hearing about this, I’m sure, and you may even have become familiar with the phrase “provider tax.” Journalistic shorthand usually does a poor job of explaining what that actually is. Bear with me for this brief explanation, because it makes clear how cruel and deliberate these cuts are.Health care services that are reimbursed by Medicaid are, well, provided by a range of different “providers.” Chief among these are hospitals, but the category also includes nursing homes, other long-term care facilities, doctors, physical therapists, even chiropractors: all sorts of people. But the big money revolves around hospitals, and specifically rural hospitals, which rely heavily on Medicaid dollars because they are poorer on balance than other hospitals. They tend to be run on a nonprofit basis. They are less likely than urban or suburban hospitals to have commercial insurance, and they’re more dependent on Medicaid revenue because their client base tends to be poorer. There are about 1,800 rural hospitals in the United States. Here’s a map.OK. Starting in the 1980s, during an earlier funding crisis, Congress allowed states to start taxing providers. In many states (this gets very complicated, and I’m not going to go into it that deeply), the cap on the tax that states can charge hospitals is 6 percent of the patient revenue money (it’s called the “safe harbor maximum” in wonkspeak). The Senate bill seeks to lower this cap over a few years to 3.5 percent.To make a long story short, when you reduce a tax, you reduce the amount of revenue it brings in. It’s also worth bearing in mind here that Medicaid reimbursements rarely cover the cost of care to begin with, so these cuts will make an already dire situation much worse. Governors and state legislatures will be staring at a quite substantial reduction in Medicaid tax revenue. They will then be faced with three choices: one, raise some other sort of tax; two, cut some other state service, like education; three, cut Medicaid services.As congressional Republicans well know, most states are going to choose number three, because it’s the easiest path. And that brings devastation. If you want to see why Republican Senator Thom Tillis is so freaked out, click on that map above and zoom in on his state, North Carolina. You’ll see in detail how many rural hospitals there are operating at a loss, and how many have already closed. So this is what Republicans are debating—and deliberately and dishonestly telling the American people that it’s a simple case of cutting “waste, fraud, and abuse,” as if they have no choice in the matter.It’s a monstrous lie.They have a choice. But of course it’s a choice they’ll never make. What is that choice? They could, in theory, reduce the tax cuts to the rich. The problem would be instantly solved.The proposed Medicaid cuts come to around $800 billion. The cost of making the 2017 income tax cuts permanent is around $2.2 trillion. So in other words, canceling the tax cuts would more than cover the proposed Medicaid cuts. In fact, the Republicans could leave nearly two-thirds of the tax cuts intact, and just pare them back, and leave Medicaid untouched. In a fantasy world, they could, dare I say it, eliminate the tax cuts altogether. They’d have $2.2 trillion to play with, and they could expand rural health care—you know, actually do something of substance for all the people who vote for them, besides scaring them into thinking that Democrats want to steal their guns and neuter their children.But you notice: No one ever, ever, ever discusses the tax cuts. No one. None of the, ahem, moderates—not Senator Susan Collins, not Representative Mike Lawler (at least that I’ve heard). Tax cuts aren’t written in ink and on paper, to Republicans. They’re written in lightning on tablets from Mount Sinai. They cannot be discussed. And these aren’t just your usual, run-of-the-mill GOP tax cuts. They’re worse. They’re the most redistributive tax cuts in modern American history, and by redistributive, I don’t mean from the top down. I mean to the top from the rest of us.Here are a few facts about the House’s version of the bill, from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, or ITEP:The richest 1 percent of Americans would receive a total of $121 billion in net tax cuts in 2026. The middle 20 percent of taxpayers on the income scale, a group that is 20 times the size of the richest 1 percent, would receive less than half that much: $56 billion in tax cuts that year.The $121 billion in net tax cuts going to the richest 1 percent next year would exceed the amount going to the entire bottom 60 percent of taxpayers (about $79 billion).The poorest fifth of Americans would receive less than 1 percent of the bill’s net tax cuts in 2026, while the richest fifth of Americans would receive 70 percent. The richest 5 percent alone would receive 45 percent of the net tax cuts that year.There’s a lot more. The richest 1 percent ($916,900 and above) will get an average cut of $68,430, or 2.5 percent. The poorest 20 percent (up to $27,000) will get a whopping cut of $30, or 0.2 percent. In percentage terms, the cut for the rich is 10 times the cut for the poor. But wait—incredibly, it gets worse. ITEP estimates that when you throw in the costs of Donald Trump’s tariff proposals, the net impact on the bottom 20 percent will be a tax increase of 2.2 percent. The tariffs aren’t finalized, of course, so we can’t really know the hard number, but as a general rule, tariffs cost poorer people more since they’re spending a far higher percentage of their income on imported necessities.The whole thing is just a disgrace. A policy disgrace. A moral disgrace. Rural hospitals will close, and working-class people will die so that Trump’s golf buddies can get tax cuts of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.The American people don’t know all the above facts and figures, but they do seem to know in their bones that this bill is a heist. It’s deeply unpopular. But even so, the Democrats could be doing much more here. Why don’t they fan out across the country one day next month and have events at money-losing rural hospitals that face potential closure? Back in the spring, when they did those anti-DOGE events in Republican districts, it seemed to have an impact. At least they were visibly doing something. There are rural hospitals in every state. Democrats could do a lot worse than to try to show rural Americans that they care. But it’s like Jon Lovitz, playing Michael Dukakis, said on Saturday Night Live back in 1988: I can’t believe we’re losing to these guys. If Democrats were more aggressive, this bill would kill Republicans off in 2026 and 2028. It’s that cruel, it’s that stupid, it’s that inept. Democrats need to find dramatic ways of saying so.This article first appeared in Fighting Words, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by editor Michael Tomasky.

No—It’s Much Worse.Most Recent PostI’ve been just staggered this week\nto hear some people—in a few cases, the exact same people—repeating the lines\nwe heard so often in 2002 and 2003: how the situation was intolerable, how the\ncountry in question posed a direct threat to the United States, how action was\nmorally and strategically imperative, and how easy it would all be.Here\nwas freshly minted Republican Senator Lindsey Graham in 2003: “It’s long past\ntime for Saddam Hussein to be replaced. President Bush used the only reasonable\noption available to him and our nation.” \n\nwas an older and no wiser Graham, having descended into the age of the lean and\nslippered pantaloon, earlier this week: “It’s time to close the chapter on\nthe ayatollah and his henchmen. Let’s close it soon and start a new chapter in\nthe Mideast: one of tolerance, hope, and peace.”You could sense the fever rising\nmidweek, when it felt like Donald Trump just might pull the trigger and unleash\nhis—actually, our—B-2 bombers on Iran’s Fordo nuclear facility. In 2002–03, as\nthe editor of The American Prospect, I watched slack-jawed while the\npropaganda machinery of official Washington (and Beltway outlets including The\nNew Republic, where dissenters were\nfew) geared up for a war that was cooked up on specious grounds and during\nwhich, alas, Iraqis did not lay rose petals at our soldiers’ feet. Because once\nGeorge W. Bush made up his mind, the Washington foreign policy establishment\ndecided collectively that when a president wants to launch a war, there’s\nnothing to be gained by opposing him.On Wednesday, I smelled the same\nsulfurous odor in the air. I simply couldn’t believe that just 22 years after\nwe waltzed into Iraq, we were going to do … not the same thing, but something\neerily similar with potentially similar consequences.Then, on Thursday afternoon, White\nHouse press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the world that the boss wanted two\nweeks. If the boss were a deliberative, rational, mature man, we could welcome\nthis as reassuring news. But as the boss is Donald Trump, it means nothing. Two\nweeks to the day from Leavitt’s announcement, as fate would have it, will bring\nthe Fourth of July—a good day for a peace deal but an even better day to go\nbombs away! Imagine Trump, after that bust\nof a military parade, having strafed Iran during the day and sitting back\nand watching all those fireworks displays at night. Strength!Trump 2.0 has ranged from being a\ndisaster to a comedy, a tragedy to a farce. But the one development that I’ve\nwatched with quiet curiosity—the one matter on which, if asked, I’d have told a\npollster I actually approved—was that Trump was seriously negotiating with\nIran. I did not, of course, approve of his abandoning the Obama-era nuclear\ndeal during his first term, but it was interesting that he was now pursuing\ndiplomacy. It was very interesting that he appeared to be willing to get\ncrossways with Benjamin Netanyahu. Until early this month, when Ayatollah\nKhamenei refused the latest U.S. offer, it really looked like we were on track\nfor a deal (the sticking\npoint was whether a proposed international consortium for civilian uranium\nenrichment be based within or outside Iran).That was June 4. As everyone now\nknows, talks were scheduled for the following Sunday, but that preceding\nThursday night, Israel started bombing, and Trump woke up Friday, turned on\nFox, saw them slavering over Bibi’s macho dice rolling, and the talks were\ndead. They might be back on now. However we feel about Trump, that would be a\nvery good thing.So: What is Trump going to do?\nGiven the apparent truism that Trump talks to different people, agrees with the\nlast person he talked to, reads nothing, and makes\nan instinctual decision at the last second, it’s worth running down the\npeople he’s talking to and what they’re probably telling him:Steve\nWitkoff. Trump’s Iran envoy’s qualifications for his position are\nthat he’s Trump’s old real\nestate and golfing buddy. His batting average so far isn’t great—he was\nsupposed to secure a ceasefire in Gaza. Who knows, maybe he’ll prove to be a\nmodern-day Bishop Talleyrand on the diplomacy front. Or maybe he won’t. But at\nleast he’s surely telling Trump to give talks a chance.Bibi\nNetanyahu. We know what he’s saying. He’ll be sharing Israeli intelligence\naimed at telling Trump that a Fordo hit can be clean, quick, and low risk. And\nit should be noted that there will be wealthy, right-wing Jewish Americans who\nmay have the president’s ear who’ll reinforce this message (Miriam\nAdelson, Bill\nAckman, etc.).Dan\nCaine, Michael Kurilla, and John Ratcliffe. Respectively, they’re the head\nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, head of the U.S. Central Command, and CIA\ndirector. Trump loves Caine, whose made-up middle name is “Razin,” because he’s\nout of “central casting” and because of his role in defeating ISIS. Of Kurilla,\nan Israeli news outlet in April said he was\n“the U.S. general Israel doesn’t want to strike Iran without.” Of Ratcliffe,\nCBS News reported\nFriday that he “has said in closed-door settings that Iran is viewed as being\nvery close to possessing nuclear weapons,” which is at least slightly at odds\nwith the less\nalarmed intel assessment Tulsi Gabbard has been touting. Sure sounds like\non balance, this group will be urging that things go boom.Steve\nBannon. We know that his is the most prominent voice urging Trump to slam\nthe brakes. He and Trump had lunch Thursday. Hard to know how seriously Trump\ntakes him. But his view does reinforce what appears to be Trump’s gut instinct\ntoward noninvolvement.Fox\nNews hosts. Don’t we kinda feel that when all is said and done, it comes\ndown to what they’re saying on Fox News at decision time? Since odds are strong\nthat whoever Trump is watching is likely to be rattling the saber to one extent\nor another, this isn’t the most comforting thought in the world.One last point. The Guardian\n\nWednesday that some in the U.S. military aren’t sure that our conventional\nbunker-buster bombs could really do the job at Fordo and that only a tactical\nnuke could do it but that Trump isn’t considering such a possibility. To which\na Fox News White House correspondent rejoined:\n“I was just told by a top official here that none of that report is true, that\nnone of the options are off the table, and the U.S. military is very confident\nthat bunker busters could get the job done at Fordo.”No options are “off the table” is\nstandard lingo in such situations. Still, even before I read about this, I had\nbeen wondering. The United States reportedly possesses nuclear warheads as\nsmall as eight kilotons (and as large as 300 kilotons). The bomb we dropped on\nHiroshima was 15 KT. Can’t you just hear someone saying to Trump: “Mr.\nPresident, it’s really just a teeny little bomb—enough to do the job without\nquestion, but not enough for the world to get into a big tizzy about”?Of course you can. And this is the\npoint: Trump, no\nprincipled pacifist, is literally capable of anything, from peacemaking to\nnuking. His “opposition” to the Iraq War, somewhat ginned up after the fact,\nhad far less to do with principle than with some tortured combination of risk\naversion and his commitment to macho stagecraft (meaning that if you’re going\nto do something, do it big—take their oil, level their cities, etc.). Those two impulses exist in tension\nwithin him. But no one should think for a second that any of it amounts to\nprinciple. One or the other will win, based on his mood that day. And so I may\nbe sitting here a month from now, slack-jawed once again as the Washington\nforeign policy establishment decides collectively that when a president wants\nto launch a war, there’s nothing to be gained by opposing him.

No—It’s Much Worse.Most Recent PostIn May 1856, Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner took to the floor of the Senate to deliver a speech denouncing slavery. Sumner was a fiery abolitionist; in his maiden speech on the floor of the Senate four years earlier, he had called for the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act, which an Alabama senator disparaged thus: “The ravings of a maniac may sometimes be dangerous, but the barking of a puppy never did any harm.” Sumner continued to inveigh against slavery and its apologists throughout his first term. Clearly, he suffered from Pierce Derangement Syndrome (Franklin).Among those Sumner attacked directly in his May 1856 speech was his Senate colleague Andrew Butler of South Carolina. His words were, to be sure, impolitic: “[Butler] has chosen a mistress to whom he has made his vows, and who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight—I mean the harlot, Slavery.” Two days later, in one of the most infamous incidents in American political history, Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina, a first cousin once removed of Butler’s, walked over to the Senate chamber, waited until no women were present in the gallery (Southern chivalry!), and attacked Sumner on the Senate floor with a metal-topped cane, beating him within an inch of his life.Alex Padilla, the Democratic California senator, did not bleed Thursday. He wasn’t even hurt. But the sight of a U.S. senator being manhandled by FBI agents was shocking enough. Lawrence O’Donnell said Thursday night that Padilla was the first senator in history to be so accosted by law enforcement officials. I don’t know for sure that that’s true, but (1) I suspect if there were another, we’d know about it, and (2) even if he’s the second or third, that wouldn’t make how he was treated any better.The incident didn’t last that long. But the real damage came after, when the lie machine reliably revved itself into action. It started with Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary whose press conference Padilla had interrupted. She went on Fox News within the hour to say he “burst in” and was “lunging” toward her and “did not identify himself.” All lies. As anyone can see from the video, he was a good 10 feet away from Noem. But even if he had lunged—and even if he were not a senator but a mere citizen, or really any human being who is not threatening violence—this is how Donald Trump’s FBI treats such people? Escort them away—OK. But push them to the ground and cuff them, when they’ve left the room and are no longer in any way a plausible “threat”?And it was in that moment—the decision by the agents to take the matter to a totally unnecessary, completely gratuitous extreme—that we find lurking the essence of Trumpism. The essence of Trumpism is just this: Dig in the heel of the boot; step on the enemy’s neck; determine in any situation the action that would be appropriately small-d democratic, and then do the opposite—go intentionally overboard, do something that shocks and offends the democratic sensibility. And then lie about it and try to reverse reality—to convince America that it didn’t see what it just saw. That truth is not what it seems.A few Republican senators, and I mean a precious few, responded appropriately. Like, one: Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski said, “It’s horrible. It is shocking at every level. It’s not the America I know.” Susan Collins emitted the usual timorous excretion. Otherwise? Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said on Morning Joe Friday that he and colleagues Cory Booker and Brian Schatz waited on the Senate floor—who knows, perhaps not far from Sumner’s Desk 29, occupied today by New Hampshire Democrat Jean Shaheen—for their GOP colleagues to appear and denounce what happened. Not only did they not do that, Murphy said: “They basically said he deserved what he got simply because he was disrespectful to the president.”But Trump was surely most pleased by House Speaker Mike Johnson, who put all the blame on Padilla and called on the Senate to censure him: “I think that that behavior at a minimum rises to the level of a censure. I think there needs to be a message sent by the body as a whole that that is not what we’re going to do; that’s not what we’re going to act.” Note the “at a minimum,” which leaves dangling the insane possibility that Padilla should … what? Just be expelled? Again, the essence of Trumpism is found in those three words.This is what they do. All the time. Trump federalizes the National Guard and sends in the Marines; he crows that if he hadn’t acted, Los Angeles would have been “completely obliterated.” Think about the scale of that lie, referring to protests in a four- or five-block area in a city of 500 square miles. He told it over and over in various forms, as did Noem and others. The behavior has its precedents in the United States: Southerners accused Sumner of faking his injuries. They argued that the cane was not heavy enough to cause severe injury. Others, more direct about matters, piped up that Sumner deserved a caning every day. And the right-wing media, like the Southern press in the 1850s, reliably echoed every word Trump, Noem, and the others said. Meanwhile the mainstream media failed dramatically this week by accepting the lazy frame that immigration is a “winner” for Trump. Two polls came out—this one and this one—showing this emphatically not to be the case. The second poll, from Quinnipiac, was bleak for Trump across the board. Only 27 percent of the country supports the big ugly bill. That’s not even all of MAGA America. People are beginning to understand that they indulged themselves last year in some fantasy projection of “Donald Trump.” They’re seeing the real article now, and they’re remembering his viciousness, his ignorance, his incompetence, and his lawlessness.And it’s going to get worse. Trumpism proceeds by the successive breaking of taboos. Each time a new one is broken, the previous one is normalized, made to look not so bad by comparison. The cuffing of Padilla was a red-line moment. And yet: There’s plenty of reason to worry that in four months, we’ll look back on it as a moment of comparative innocence.This article first appeared in Fighting Words, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by editor Michael Tomasky.

In addition, a second federal court has also issued a ruling blocking t","summary":"More ghastly, parallel-universe news this week. The man in charge of America’s public health said he didn’t know how many people died of Covid and added, despite his ignorance, that he is certain that the Covid vaccine has killed more people than Covid itself did (all this while he’s denying Americans access to the Covid vaccine). We committed a probable act of war against Venezuela. The president of the United States was mocked by the leaders of China, Russia, and India. And as of Friday, the Department of Defense is apparently going back to the future and becoming the Department of War, I guess because “defense” is too passive a cognomen for the real men of MAGA-land.\n\nBut maybe the most ominous development of the week doesn’t concern the Trump administration at all. It’s the news that Bari Weiss is apparently about to become the head, or something, of CBS News. This is bad for CBS, sure.

Here are some of the things. This is TPM’s Morning Memo. Sign up for the email version.\n\nQuestions His Allegiance\n\nD.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro savaged a sitting federal magistrate who had chastised her prosecutors for their conduct in yet another case where a grand jury declined to indict. \n\nIn a screed on X, Pirro said that Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui has “repeatedly indicated his allegiance to those who violate the law.”\n\nThe highly unusual remarks from a U.S. attorney came after Faruqui called prosecutors in Pirro’s office to task for overcharging cases in federal court as part of President Trump’s performative takeover of D.C. Pirro has ordered her office to charge cases in federal court that would previously have gone to D.C. Superior Court. In several instances, federal grand juries have refused to indict those cases. \n\n“It’s not fair to say they’re losing credibility. We’re past that now,” Faruqui said, according to the AP. He later added, “There’s no credibility left.”\n\nFaruqui was particularly incensed that criminal defendants were spending extended time in jail while prosecutors failed to secure indictments. In an order Thursday, he questioned whether the Trump DOJ was abiding by the long-standing principle that it should only bring winnable cases. \n\n“Given that there have been an unprecedented number of cases that the U.S. Attorney dismissed in the past ten days, all of whom were detained for some period of time, the Court is left to question if this principle still applies,” Faruqui wrote.\n\nThe smackdown from Faruqui triggered Pirro’s over-the-top outburst on X: “This judge took an oath to follow the law, yet he has allowed his politics to consistently cloud his judgment and his requirement to follow the law. America voted for safe communities, law and order, and this judge is the antithesis of that.”\n\nTrump Is Getting Exactly the Headlines He Wants\n\nMajor news outlets continue to struggle to distinguish their coverage of legitimate criminal investigations from the politically motivated “probes” of the Trump DOJ:\n\nWSJ: DOJ Opens Criminal Investigation Into Fed’s Cook, Issues SubpoenasABC News: Justice Department opens criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Governor Lisa CookNBC News: Justice Department takes new steps in Lisa Cook investigation\n\nNo, Trump Can’t Unilaterally Rename DoD\n\nWith President Trump reportedly set to “rebrand” the Department of Defense as the Department of War, the news coverage has overwhelmingly treated a name-change as something he can unilaterally do. It is not. The department was named by Congress, and Congress would need to authorize any name change. \n\nAs The Guardian reports:\n\nA draft White House fact sheet on Trump’s rebranding initiative implicitly acknowledges that only Congress can formally change the department’s name, saying that the order would authorize the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, to propose legislation that would make the change permanent. In the meantime, the order instructs Hegseth and the department to start using “Department of War” as a secondary title in official correspondence, public communications and executive branch documents. The order also authorizes Hegseth to refer to himself as the “secretary of war”.\n\nQuote of the Day\n\n“Those governments will help us find these people and blow them up. They might do it themselves, and we’ll help them do it.”–Secretary of State Marco Rubio, touting Trump’s lawless policy of unleashing the military against criminal gangs \n\nMore Removals of Children to Come This Weekend?\n\nThe lawyers who jumped in to stop the dead-of-night removals of unaccompanied Guatemalan children last weekend told a federal judge in a new filing Thursday night that they have reports that the Trump administration “may imminently seek to remove unaccompanied children of other nationalities” this coming weekend. \n\nSCOTUS Watch: Facepalm Edition\n\nIn a public appearance just two weeks after castigating district judges for not treating the Supreme Court’s shadow docket decisions as binding precedent, Justice Brett Kavanaugh admitted that the emergency rulings sometimes lack clarity because they’re a product of compromise and a lack of consensus among the justices. Criticizing district judges for not better divining the muddled, unexplained positions of the justices is precisely what has some federal judges in an uproar.On her book tour, Justice Amy Coney Barrett insisted to Bari Weiss that the country is not in a constitutional crisis: “I don’t know what a constitutional crisis would look like. I don’t think that we are currently in a constitutional crisis, however.” Meanwhile, Chief Justice John Roberts is actively fighting off a lawsuit by a legal advocacy organization founded by Stephen Miller that seeks to declare that the administrative and policy-making arms of the federal court system are a part of the executive branch in a below-the-radar attempt to strengthen President Trump’s hand over the judicial branch.\n\nOnly the Best People\n\nE.J. Antoni, Trump’s controversial pick to run the Bureau of Labor Statistics, “operated a since-deleted Twitter account that featured sexually degrading attacks on Kamala Harris, derogatory remarks about gay people, conspiracy theories, and crude insults aimed at critics of President Donald Trump,” CNN reports.If confirmed, Federal Reserve nominee Stephen Miran plans to keep his job as a senior White House economic adviser, merely taking a leave of absence to serve on the Fed at a time when President Trump is trying to bring the central bank firmly under his thumb.\n\nRinse and Repeat: Loyalty Trumps Integrity \n\nNavy Secretary John Phelan has restored former Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-TX) to the rank of rear admiral, the WaPo reported based on a letter Jackson posted on social media. Jackson, who served as White House physician for Obama and Trump before he was elected to the House, was the subject of a withering 2021 inspector general report about misconduct allegations that had previously sunk his nomination to be secretary of Veterans Affairs. In response, he was demoted to captain, a move Jackson had long claimed was politically motivated because it came early in the Biden presidency, even though the allegations had arisen long before.","summary":"A lot of things happened.

Instead, CBS shamefully edited the interview to whitewash the truth about this MS-13 gang member and the threat he poses to American public safety.”\n\n“Face the Nation” did air Noem’s comments about criminal charges hanging over the Salvadoran and her pledge to “make sure that he doesn’t walk free in the United States.”\n\nBut the live broadcast edited out her assertion that Abrego Garcia is a “known human smuggler, an MS-13 member” and a wife-beater and that he solicited nude photos from minors—all un-adjudicated charges that can be culled from government documents.\n\nIn May, a federal prosecutor charged Abrego Garcia with conspiracy to transport aliens, including MS-13 members, aka human smuggling. The Salvadoran has not had his day in court.\n\nAnd there have been no criminal charges for the other allegations. Noem should have spoken more carefully.\n\nBack to “Face the Nation.” Noem accused CBS of a “whitewash”—and I’d be inclined to agree except for one thing.\n\nSpoiler alert:\n\nA CBS News spokesperson told Fox News Digital, “Secretary Noem’s ‘Face The Nation’ interview was edited for time and met all CBS News standards. The entire interview is publicly available on YouTube, and the full transcript was posted earlier this morning on CBSNews.com.”\n\nThat’s right. While the live broadcast excluded Noem’s allegations, CBS published the full quote—human-smuggling, wife-beating, truly creepy search for nudes and all—in the online version of the show, as well as the transcript.\n\nYes, probably more people saw the live show than the transcript.\n\nBut then, this story has more legs because of the omission.\n\nAlso: Many Americans don’t trust CBS. Just last year, the network’s “60 Minutes” was hammered—righteously—for editing then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ remarks in a way that cleaned up some of her word salad.\n\nWorse, CBS aired two different parts of a Harris quote on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu—all but an engraved invitation for critics to see unbridled liberal bias.\n\nHere’s where Trump comes in.\n\nIn 2024, CBS would not release the raw video or transcripts of its “60 Minutes” Harris interview in the face of Trump’s demands in the name of transparency.\n\nBut amid an FCC inquiry, a couple of weeks after Trump won back the White House, CBS released the full Harris transcript and videos citing “the value of transparency and the public interest here.”\n\nIt took a presidential election to move the needle, but it’s nice to see CBS in the transparency club.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Larry Nadler — who, at 78, is 10 years younger than Norton — announced this week that he’s finally throwing in the towel, citing the need for a “generational change” in the party.\n\nWatching former President Joe Biden step aside for his Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election “really said something about the necessity for generational change in the party,” the 34-year congressman told the New York Times, “and I think I want to respect that.”\n\nHowever, Rep. David Scott (DA-GA), 80, and Rep. John Larson (D-CT), 77, also confirmed they planned to run for re-election even amid worries about their health.\n\n“Generational change is fine, but you’ve got to earn it,” Larson told Axios. “It’s not like, ‘Oh geez, you know what, why didn’t I think of that? Now’s the time for me to step down because, well, it’s generational change!’”\n\nLarson suffered a “complex partial seizure” on the House floor in February, freezing up mid-speech in what his team blamed on an adverse reaction to new medication. Concerns about Larson’s declining mental fitness have also been widely reported.\n\nEleven of the 14 members of Congress over the age of 80 are Democrats. And with the exception of the House’s second-oldest representative, 87-year-old Hal Rogers (R-KY), the next five oldest members are all Democrats.\n\nThree elderly Democratic House members have died already this year, all over the age of 70: the Dems have lost Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), 75; Rep.

It’s like: ‘time for a gay guy!’”\n\nCarlson’s comment may be referring to the fact that Pete Buttigieg reportedly dated girls in college. \n\n‘I doubt he even knows’ \n\nCarlson went on, giving the impression that he knows a great deal about gay sex: “I’ve always wanted to interview him. He’s never agreed to an interview but I’m going to ask him like some very specific questions about gay sex and see if he can even answer. I doubt he even knows.”\n\nButtigieg came out as gay in 2015. Soon after he met his now-husband Chasten on Hinge. He says they bonded over a plate of Scotch eggs in a South Bend, Indiana pub.\n\nThe pair married in June 2018, three years after they connected on the dating app Hinge. The former US secretary of transportation and his husband, Chasten, adopted twins Penelope and Joseph in 2021. \n\nCarlson previously claimed that Kamala Harris’ former running mate, Tim Walz, looks “super, super gay”. \n\nIn a discussion about Walz, he appeared to contradict his claims that Buttigieg isn’t gay, saying: “I was a little surprised that [Kamala Harris] picked Tim Walz. If you want a gay guy, why not just go with Pete Buttigieg.” \n\nCarlson said of Walz: “Tim Walz is very obviously gay. I look at him and I’m like, ‘well you’re gay’. I’m sure I’ll be attacked for saying that, and maybe he’s not gay, but he certainly seems gay.” \n\nThere is no evidence that Walz is gay.

There were those that said, ‘You know, people throw daggers at you anyway, they’re really gonna throw daggers at you.’ So, I thought about it. I weighed the pros and cons. I really thought, ‘I don’t know if I’m going to influence it at this point,’” he said. \n\n“There’s been a hard line drawn in the sand, and you’re either on one side or the other. I thought about if you persuade five voters, and who knows, it may be a five-vote difference. Then, I would be beside myself if I didn’t take advantage of that.\n\n“It wasn’t my cup of tea. I’m not a public speaker. I’m certainly not a political public speaker. But it was an honor that I was asked. And do I agree with everything President Trump says or does? No. Does he agree with everything that I do? No. Nor with anyone on the other side. \n\n“But from a common sense perspective, do you really think boys should compete in girls sports and that’s fair? No. The illegal (immigration), the crime, the border, the things because of it — how can you think that’s OK? I’m all for doing the right thing for the people, but we have to protect our own first.”\n\nHe said he also wondered whether supporters on the left thought about whether the country’s direction was really something they wanted to further support.\n\nHe said he couldn’t be one of those supporters who rested on his laurels, hoping things would get better.\n\n“Some of the things that you’re, on the left, are saying is normal, do ever not look in the mirror when no one is looking and it’s just you and you go, ‘Are we out of our damn mind?’” he said. “So, I felt like the conservative crowd, in general, sits on our hands, and I think at times I was like you just expect people to do the right thing and to make common sense decisions. \n\n“So, you sit on your hands and you expect that.

Last month, the former president was seen attending the funeral of former Delaware governor and congressman Mike Castle with a bandage on his head, according to Fox News. \n\nIt marks the latest development in Biden’s health struggles after his office revealed in May that he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that had spread to his bones. \n\nWhile Biden was still eyeing another term in the White House, a prostate nodule was found after he had been seen by doctors for urinary symptoms, his office said. He was subsequently diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer, which had metastasized and was given a Gleason score of nine. \n\n“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,” his office said on May 18. \n\nA day later, Biden said in a statement: “Cancer touches us all. Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places.”\n\nThe Biden family has faced cancer repeatedly over the years. Biden’s son Beau died of a brain tumor in 2015, and his wife, Jill, has had two cancerous lesions removed. \n\n In November 2021, Biden had a polyp removed from his colon that was a benign but potentially pre-cancerous lesion. \n\nIn 2022, the then-president made a “cancer moonshot” one of his administration's priorities, attempting to halve the cancer death rate over the next 25 years. The initiative was a continuation of his work as vice president to address a disease that had killed his older son, Beau.\n\nBiden had a skin lesion, a basal cell carcinoma, removed from his chest in February 2023. \n\nAs he vied for reelection in 2024, Biden’s physical and mental health became a major concern for voters. \n\nBiden, who would have been 86 years old by the time he finished another term, was described by his physician in February 2024 as a “healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.” \n\nHis medical conditions, including a-fib, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux, seasonal allergies, spinal arthritis and sensory peripheral neuropathy in both feet, “remain stable and well-controlled,” the physician said. \n\nQuestions compounded over Biden’s mental acuity last June when he took on Donald Trump in their first televised debate, which saw the 81-year-old stumbling over his words, losing his train of thought and, at points, freezing altogether.\n\nA snap poll conducted by CBS and YouGov after the debate also showed that less than 30 percent thought Biden should be in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nOn July 21, 2024, Biden withdrew from the race, being succeeded by Democratic candidate then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump at the ballot box in November.","summary":"Former president underwent Mohs, a procedure to remove cancerous skin cells, months after revealing his stage 4 prostate cancer diagnosis","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/joe-biden-skin-cancer-surgery-b2820700.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/02/16/42/GettyImages-2190302170.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/gqZRawT3-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-05 08:14:29","author":"James Liddell","authors":["James Liddell"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.433},{"id":357584888,"title":"Teachers’ Day Special: Sitarist Rishab Sharma Shares Pandit Ravi Shankar’s ‘Guru Mantra’","text":"Rishab Rikhiram Sharma, the youngest and final disciple of sitar maestro Pandit Ravi Shankar, is continuing to uphold Indian classical music’s greatest legacies while also building his own niche. Born into the esteemed Rikhi Ram family, Rishab was introduced to the world of music by his father, Sanjay Rikhi Ram Sharma, a master luthier.\nBut it is no easy feat to carry these legacies forward. After the success of his recent Sitar for Mental Health India Tour, the sitarist-musician sat down for an interview with the Hindustan Times, where he talked about the double responsibility of carrying both his family’s and guru’s legacy.\nCounting his blessings and crediting his teachers (gurus) for becoming a name to reckon with, Rishab said, “There is a lot of self-talk that goes into thinking, if not me, then who’s going to take [the legacy] forward? One is my guru’s legacy, and the other is my family’s legacy. I need to carry both of these with equal weight… But, you know, I am very determined to take it forward…”\nRishab Rikhiram Sharma Finds a Life Purpose Through Grief\nThe loss of his guru in 2012, followed by the passing of Ustad Zakir Hussain in 2024, left Rishab feeling orphaned in the music world. “The deaths of him and Ustad Zakir Hussain are the two biggest losses, even in our music. When I lost them, I had no role models to look up to. That’s when I looked at myself and thought, ‘I’m gonna be that someone who a child would look up to,’” he shared.\nHow Did Pandit Ravi Shankar Find Rishab?\nRishab was just a young boy when he met his guru, Pandit Ravi Shankar, who discovered him via a YouTube video. “And discovering my video of playing sitar… that’s how he found me… In any field, a guru is a person who shows you the light. And the most important thing that my guruji taught me was ‘how to think’. He never asked me to copy him. Viewing music through his lens, I developed my own way of looking at things. Today, my music is a reflection of who I am as a person,” Rishab smiles, recalling the surreal beginning of his journey.\nHis belief in the deep spiritual connection between guru and shishya (disciple) remains strong. “You won’t believe it; there was this one time when I forgot the second half of a music piece. That night when I went to bed, Guruji came in my dream and reminded me how that composition is to be played. Whether it’s your subconscious mind or whatever, if you have that connection with your guru, then they would even come in your dreams to teach you,” he recalled.\nMusic for Mental Health\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Rishab lost his maternal grandfather. It was after this incident that he used music as a medium to raise awareness around mental health. “I learnt it the hard way, but my goal was to use music and introduce people to how they can help themselves through anxiety and depression,” Rishab stated.\nHe also revealed that he draws inspiration from American rapper-singer Kanye West’s 2018 album ‘ye.’ “He is one artist I would like to mention for coming up with an album on going through a mental illness, which gave me a lot of courage. A musician using music to make noise about mental health… that’s a beautiful thing,” he added.\nMore About Rishab Sharma\nRishab first picked up the sitar at the age of 10 and took to the stage by 13. Since then, he has toured across India, the US, Canada and South America. His most iconic moment came when he became the first sitarist to perform solo at the White House during a Diwali event, on the invitation of then President Joe Biden, First Lady Jill Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.","summary":"Rishab Rikhiram Sharma talked about the double responsibility of carrying both his family and guru’s legacy.","url":"https://www.news18.com/movies/bollywood/teachers-day-special-sitarist-rishab-sharma-shares-pandit-ravi-shankars-guru-mantra-aa-ws-l-9550764.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design-2025-09-05T113951.184-2025-09-dd11812a4dd6495ab4d336d3af752d3e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-05 06:12:16","author":"Kashvi Raj Singh,News18","authors":["Kashvi Raj Singh","News18"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.336},{"id":357589462,"title":"Joe Biden undergoes surgery to remove skin cancer from forehead","text":"US President Joe Biden recently underwent surgery to remove skin cancer lesions, his spokesperson confirmed on Thursday. \n\nKelly Scully, his representative, verified the procedure after Inside Edition broadcast footage of him leaving a Delaware church with a fresh scar on his forehead.\n\nShe said Biden received Mohs surgery, a procedure used to cut away skin until no evidence of cancer remains. \n\nTwo years ago, while Biden was in office, he had a lesion removed from his chest.

You know, it’s just so ― it’s so fake, that’s why the media has so little credibility,” he said, oddly blaming news organizations for rumors of his impending demise that existed only on social media.\n\nTrump, who spreads conspiracy theories on a near-daily basis and has eagerly spread unfounded rumours about opponents ranging from Ben Carson to Hillary Clinton to Joe Biden, appeared not to appreciate the irony.\n\n“It’s the apotheosis of karma for the man who pretended Hillary was on death’s door,” said Rick Wilson, a veteran Republican political consultant in Florida who broke with his party after Trump seized control of it in 2016. “Mr. ‘Low Stamina’ is now the butt of his own joke.”\n\nTrump’s White House did not respond to HuffPost queries on the matter.\n\nSince he began his political career a decade ago, Trump has repeatedly questioned both the physical and mental states of his opponents, starting with those in the 2016 Republican presidential primary field. He began by calling Jeb Bush “low energy,” suggesting that the former Florida governor, who was a collegiate tennis player and was known in Tallahassee for his long work days, lacked the stamina for the presidency.\n\nAs the primary continued, Trump turned his attention to others. When Carson rose in the polls, Trump claimed the neurosurgeon was a violent sociopath.\n\n“He went after his mother with a hammer and he wanted to hit his mother over the head with a hammer, that he stabbed somebody, that he hit somebody in the face with a lock. He wanted to, he smashed somebody’s face with a lock, with a padlock and other things,” Trump said in November 2015. “He’s got a pathological temper or something.”\n\nA few months later, Trump decided it was actually Texas Senator Ted Cruz who was “unhinged.”\n\n“Ted Cruz is a totally unstable individual. He is the single biggest liar I’ve ever come across, in politics or otherwise, and I have seen some of the best of them,” Trump said, apparently unironically, on February 15, 2016.\n\nThe next day, Trump added: “He’s got a mental problem.”\n\nWhen the general election arrived, Trump pushed conspiracy theories that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was close to death.\n\n“It’s interesting because they say pneumonia, but she was coughing very, very badly a week ago ... It’s very interesting to see what’s going on,” he said in September 2016.\n\nFour years later, facing Democratic challenger Joe Biden and long before his physical decline, Trump — who for years has had trouble completing a cogent thought without meandering off into falsehoods and absurd tangents — claimed that the former vice president was already incapacitated.\n\n“Joe is shot. He’s mentally shot,” Trump said in September 2020. “Joe is not mentally equipped to be president, that I can tell you right now.”\n\nAnd in 2024, campaigning to regain the White House, Trump continued his attacks on Biden’s mental acuity — “Biden doesn’t know he’s alive” — before seamlessly transferring the attacks onto Biden’s vice president, Kamala Harris, when she became the nominee.\n\n“I have just seen Kamala’s Report, and it is not good. According to her Doctor’s Report, she suffers from ‘urticaria,’ defined as ‘a rash of round, red welts on the skin that itch intensely, sometimes with dangerous swelling,’” he wrote on social media. “She also has ‘allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis,’ a very messy and dangerous situation. These are deeply serious conditions that clearly impact her functioning.”\n\nThese constant claims of his opponents’ unfitness were accompanied by an opacity as to his own health.\n\nEnding a decades-long custom of presidential nominees releasing actual medical reports describing their condition, Trump instead had his personal physician write a letter for the news media praising Trump as the perfect specimen.\n\n“If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,” stated a letter under the name of Harold Bornstein, Trump’s New York City doctor.\n\nIn the weeks after taking office in 2017, Trump’s White House staff went to Bornstein’s office to confiscate all of Trump’s medical records, an action Bornstein described as a “raid.”\n\nTrump’s White House continued his refusal to be candid about his health. In January 2018, White House doctor Ronny Jackson, who later won a seat in Congress based on his devotion to Trump, described Trump to reporters in terms rivaling Trump’s own self-praise.\n\n“Some people just have great genes. I told the president if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years he might live to be 200,” he said.\n\nJackson’s report also stated that Trump weighed 239 pounds, when those who viewed him up close could see plainly that he weighed considerably more. One top aide at the time estimated, on condition of anonymity, that Trump weighed “north of 300.”\n\n(Jackson’s report and subsequent White House medical reports for Trump also give him a height of 6-foot-3, an inch taller than Trump had claimed prior to running for the presidency.)\n\nIn November 2019, Trump made a secretive trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and White House officials refused to explain why. (His press secretary at the time revealed in a 2021 book that it was to undergo a routine colonoscopy.)\n\nAs he began his run to return to the White House in November 2022, Trump again refused to release medical records. When he was shot in the ear by a would-be assassin in July 2024, he refused to make the doctors who treated him available to the media and his campaign offered only the vaguest statements as to his condition.\n\nThe obfuscation appears to have continued right into his second term.\n\nAfter Trump underwent a physical at Walter Reed in April, the new White House doctor’s report claimed his weight was down to 224 pounds, which again seemed at odds with his physical appearance.\n\nPhysician Sean Barbabella’s report also assessed that Trump has an “active lifestyle” that contributes to his “excellent health.”\n\n“President Trump’s days include participation in multiple meetings, public appearances, press availability, and frequent victories in golf events,” Barbabella wrote — apparently suggesting that Trump’s “victories” at courses he owns provided him better exercise than if he had lost.\n\nThe report failed to mention any problem with Trump’s blood circulation, which was disclosed as a “chronic” condition only after photos of Trump’s swollen ankles and calves began circulating on social media.\n\nTests found “chronic venous insufficiency, a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70,” Barbabella wrote in a July 17 letter, adding that bruises on his right hand were caused by “frequent handshaking” and his prescribed use of aspirin.\n\nBarbabella did not address why the circulatory problem was not found in the earlier physical and concluded, “President Trump remains in excellent health.”\n\nJosh Schwerin, an aide to Clinton during the 2016 campaign, said it was unfortunate that the new fixation on Trump’s health is again helping him distract from his inability to deliver on what many voters wanted when they picked him over Harris.\n\n“All Americans know for a fact that the cost of things like groceries, electricity and child care continue to skyrocket. Trump has yet to find a cure for that potent problem,” he said.","summary":"President Donald Trump exits the White House and walks to his motorcade, en route to the Trump National Golf Club on Sept. 1, 2025, in Washington, DC.America’s conspiracy-theorist-in-chief Donald Trump is confronting some about his own health now, after a decade of claiming his political opponents were too mentally and physically ill to handle the presidency.\n\n“Well, it’s fake news.

Newsom has also raised his national profile with his mocking of Trump on social media.Some Democrats believe the governor is meeting calls to fight back harder against Republicans following frustration among the party's voter base over what many viewed as a feeble response to the Trump administration.What To KnowThe latest Yahoo/YouGov poll shows how Newsom has surged to the front of the Democratic Party's 2028 presidential primary pack with 21 percent of registered voters who lean Democratic choosing him as their preferred candidate.That puts Newsom slightly ahead of former Vice President Kamala Harris, who garnered 19 percent; New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 12 percent; former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, 10 percent; Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, 7 percent; Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, 4 percent; Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, also 4 percent; and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who was chosen by 2 percent of voters.A poll conducted in mid-August by Echelon Insights had Newsom in second place among potential Democratic candidates, with 13 percent support, behind Harris with 26 percent.Going back to April, an Echelon Insights poll had Newsom trailing in sixth place, with 4 percent, behind Buttigieg and Ocasio-Cortez, who were both at 7 percent. Harris was again in first place, with 28 percent.The new Yahoo/YouGov survey of 1,690 U.S. adults was conducted from August 29 to September 2. The margin of error is approximately 3.1 percent.The survey found that Democrats and Democratic leaners under age 45 prefer both Harris (27 percent) and Ocasio-Cortez (22 percent) to Newsom (13 percent) as a potential 2028 presidential nominee. Newsom's strength is largely concentrated among Democrats over 45, among whom he leads Harris 26 percent to 13 percent.The poll also found that Newsom's social media strategy of imitating Trump's aggressive, all-caps style to mock him was not particularly popular, with 33 percent of respondents approving of it and 43 percent saying they disapprove.What People Are SayingNewsom told The Wall Street Journal in June: \"I'm not thinking about running, but it's a path that I could see unfold.\"CNN's Harry Enten said in an August 20 X post: \"Newsom's social media strategy/opposition to Trump is working. He's gained millions of social media followers. Google searches for him are up like a rocket. He's now the frontrunner for the 2028 Dem nomination per the prediction markets….Democrats want a fighter.\"Trump told reporters in June: \"He's done a terrible job. I like Gavin Newsom. He's a nice guy, but he's grossly incompetent, everybody knows.\"What Happens NextTypically, candidates don't make campaign announcements until after the midterms, and Newsom's second term as governor ends in early 2027. A multitude of prominent Democrats are expected to run. Until then, polls will be monitored to gauge Americans' views on potential candidates.","summary":"The survey indicates the California governor's more aggressive stance is paying off.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/newsom-surges-poll-democratic-primary-frontrunner-2124888","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2716355/newsom-surges-new-poll.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=57295793af076bf68ea4a6ec3a87eb55","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-05 03:33:02","author":"Robert Birsel","authors":["Robert Birsel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":357521344,"title":"LAPD will assist CHP in protecting Kamala Harris after Trump pulls Secret Service","text":"Los Angeles police Metropolitan Division officers, meant to be working crime-suppression assignments in hard-hit areas of the city, are instead providing security for former Vice President Kamala Harris, sources told The Times. The department is \"assisting the California Highway Patrol in providing protective services for former Vice President Kamala Harris until an alternate plan is established,\" said Jennifer Forkish, L.A. police communications director. \"This temporary coordinated effort is in place to ensure that there is no lapse in security.\" A dozen or more officers have begun working a detail to protect Harris after President Trump revoked her Secret Service protection as of Monday. Sources not authorized to discuss the details of the plan said the city would fund the security but that the arrangement was expected to be brief, with Harris hiring her own security in the near future. Trump ended an arrangement that had extended Harris' security coverage beyond the six months that vice presidents are usually provided after leaving office. California officials then put into place a plan for the California Highway Patrol to provide dignitary protection for Harris. At some point, the LAPD was added to the plan, according to the sources, as California law enforcement scrambled to take over from the Secret Service on Monday. A security detail was captured outside Harris' Brentwood home by a FOX 11 helicopter as the station broke the story of the use of L.A. police. The Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union that represents rank-and-file LAPD officers, criticized the move. \"Pulling police officers from protecting everyday Angelenos to protect a failed presidential candidate who also happens to be a multi-millionaire, with multiple homes and who can easily afford to pay for her own security, is nuts,\" its board of directors said in a statement to The Times. Mayor Karen Bass \"should tell Governor Newsom that if he wants to curry favor with Ms. Harris and her donor base, then he should open up his own wallet because LA taxpayers should not be footing the bill for this ridiculousness.\" Newsom, who would need to sign off on CHP protection, has not confirmed the arrangement to the Times. Izzy Gordon, a spokesperson for Newsom, simply said, \"The safety of our public officials should never be subject to erratic, vindictive political impulses.\" Newsom's office and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass' office had discussions last week on how best to address the situation, according to sources not authorized to talk about the details. Bass, in a statement last week, commented on Trump scrapping the security detail for Harris, saying, \"This is another act of revenge following a long list of political retaliation in the form of firings, the revoking of security clearances, and more. This puts the former Vice President in danger and I look forward to working with the governor to make sure Vice President Harris is safe in Los Angeles.\" Her office did not response to comment on the LAPD deployment on Thursday. Two law enforcement sources told The Times that the Metro officers had been slated to go to the San Fernando Valley for crime-suppression work before their assignment changed. Deploying LAPD officers to protect Harris was a source of controversy within the department in years past. During L.A. Police Chief Charlie Beck's tenure, when Harris was a U.S. senator, plainclothes officers served as security and traveled with her from January 2017 to July 2018. It was an arrangement that then-Mayor Eric Garcetti said he was unaware of until Beck's successor ended it. Beck said at the time through a spokesman that the protection was granted based on a threat assessment. Beck's successor, Michel Moore, ended the protection in July 2018 after he said a new evaluation determined it was no longer needed. The decision came as The Times filed a lawsuit seeking records from Garcetti detailing the costs of security related to his own extensive travel. Trump signed a memorandum on Thursday ending Harris' protection as of Monday, according to sources not authorized to discuss the security matter. Former vice presidents usually get Secret Service protection for six months after leaving office, while former presidents are given protection for life. But before his term ended, then-President Biden signed an order to extend Harris' protection beyond six months, to July 2026. Aides to Harris had asked Biden for the extension. Without it, her security detail would have ended last month, according to sources. The Secret Service, the CHP and Los Angeles police do not discuss details of dignitary protection in terms of deployment, numbers, or travel teams. CNN first reported the removal of Harris' protection detail. The curtailing of Secret Service protection comes as Harris is about to begin a book tour for her memoir, titled “107 Days.” The tour has 15 stops, which include visits to London and Toronto.

Only about 40% of what it raised even pretended to benefit the campaigns it name-dropped, and that was spent on ineffective ads that further fed the consulting machine through commissions and fees. \n\nRelated | Don’t fall for scam PACs claiming to support Harris\n\nThe rot at the root of this theft is Mothership Strategies, the digital consulting agency that soaked up much of this cash. Run by two former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee insiders who pioneered the “DOOOOM” emails I’ve been railing against since 2014, Mothership turned small-dollar voter passion into a personal ATM. As Bonica explained, after subtracting the massive operational costs—the payments to Mothership, the fees for texting services, the cost of digital ads and list rentals—the final sum delivered to candidates and committees was vanishingly small. In other words, just 1.6% of what was raised ever reached Democratic candidates.\n\nAnd let’s not pretend that their ad spending really helps Democrats. According to AdImpact, the Harris campaign and her allies spent nearly $1.4 billion on political ads—roughly half a billion more than Trump—only to lose. Ads don’t win elections. They’re grossly inefficient, a default path for consultant-driven operations more focused on lucrative volume buys than strategic, grassroots investment.\n\nTo further illustrate this point, every single Democratic campaign that the affiliated Retired Americans PAC bought media for lost. All of them. Even the money they didn’t steal was pissed away. \n\nWhat a catastrophic waste of resources. While conservatives invest in core infrastructure—media outlets like Fox News, think tanks like the Heritage Foundation (the force behind Project 2025), podcasters and influencers, and networks of grassroots organizers—we’re lighting hundreds of millions of dollars on fire. Imagine what the $650 million Mothership stole from well-intentioned donors could have done if campaigns themselves had spent it on voter registration or door-knocking. Imagine if it had gone into building permanent progressive infrastructure, like the media site you’re reading right now. \n\nInstead, it went into the pockets of traitors to the cause, exploiting people genuinely worried about our democracy and eager to do something about it.\n\nIt is fucking infuriating.\n\nI didn’t mean to turn this into a fundraising appeal for Daily Kos, but I will. The right funds its media ecosystem because it knows that shaping public opinion is the foundation of political power. We need to do the same. If you value Daily Kos, and if you value bold progressive voices still fighting to cut through the noise, we need your support.\n\nBecause it’s nauseating to think of what hard-working organizations could have done with those stolen hundreds of millions. We can’t let it happen again.\n\nScam PACs will be back—because they’re lucrative. Don’t give them a dime. Tell your friends and family not to either. Support candidates early, before their consultants funnel everything into mostly worthless ads. Early candidate money builds organization and grassroots voter outreach. And please please please support progressive organizations you trust. Start by investing in the progressive media you trust, like Daily Kos, and the outlets and influencers we need in this fight.\n\nThat’s how we make sure our money fuels the fight, not the scam.","summary":"Nearly $678 million was raised by scam PACs during the 2024 election cycle, yet less than $11 million of that sum went to Democratic candidates or the party’s national committee.

The Packers legend spoke at one of Trump’s rallies in Green Bay, Wisconsin, before the election took place. Trump eventually defeated then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the general election, carrying Wisconsin on to the win. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Favre said in a recent interview with sports personality Sage Steele that he took a \"common sense\" approach when it came to his decision to support Trump. I thought about the rally in Green Bay when he asked if I would come talk. There were those that said, ‘You know, people throw daggers at you anyway, they’re really gonna throw daggers at you.’ So, I thought about it. I weighed the pros and cons. I really thought I don’t know if I’m going to influence it at this point,\" he said. \"There’s been a hard line drawn in the sand and you’re either on one side or the other. I thought about if you persuade five voters, and who knows, it may be a five-vote difference. Then, I would be beside myself if I didn’t take advantage of that. \"It wasn’t my cup of tea. I’m not a public speaker. I’m certainly not a political public speaker. But it was an honor that I was asked. And, do I agree with everything President Trump says or does? No. Does he agree with everything that I do? No. Nor with anyone on the other side. But from a common sense perspective, do you really think boys should compete in girls’ sports and that’s fair? No. The illegal (immigration), the crime, the border, the things because of it – how can you think that’s OK?

He said he couldn’t be one of those supporters who rested on his laurels, hoping things would get better. \"Some of the things that you’re, on the left, are saying is normal, do ever not look in the mirror when no one is looking and it’s just you and you go, ‘Are we out of our damn mind?’\" he said. \"So, I felt like the conservative crowd in general sits on our hands, and I think at times I was like you just expect people to do the right thing and to make common sense decisions. \"So, you sit on your hands and you expect that and it doesn’t happen and it continues to get worse. And the left has no problem talking. They don’t shut up, and they blame it all on everyone else.

Rick Scott (R-FL) introduced a Senate resolution Thursday condemning socialism as a failed ideology as New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani (D) campaigns on socialist policies.\n\nScott announced the resolution in a press release and reiterated his stance in a post on X, writing, “Socialism NEVER works. It’s destroyed countries, crushed economies and robbed millions of their basic human rights. I’m proud to lead a resolution condemning this failed ideology and reminding the far-left that Americans will ALWAYS reject it.”\n\nThe resolution, titled Denouncing the Horrors of Socialism, declares that socialism “collapses into communist regimes, totalitarian rule, and brutal dictatorships,” and cites historical examples in the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, North Korea, and Venezuela. It asserts that socialist policies have led to famine, repression, and mass killings, pointing to figures including Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro, Pol Pot, Hugo Chávez, and Nicolás Maduro.\n\nIn his statement, Scott emphasized his experience representing Florida communities with ties to countries ruled by socialist governments. “Just look at Cuba and Venezuela, or talk to any of the thousands of families in my state who fled those regimes after evil dictators stripped them of every opportunity,” he said. “Time and time again, socialism has led to the same, inevitable outcomes: misery, poverty, and oppression.”\n\nRep. María Elvira Salazar (R-FL) brought forward a companion resolution in the House. \n\nShe remarked:\n\nHistory is clear: from Stalin’s gulags and Cambodia’s killing fields to Castro’s firing squads in Havana, socialism has always ended in misery, suffering, and death. Entire nations have been destroyed and millions of lives shattered, including many in my own community who fled its brutality.”\n\nThe resolution follows Scott’s letter to the Wall Street Journal in July, where he criticized Mamdani and other socialists for vilifying capitalism while benefiting from it. In the piece, Scott wrote that capitalism made the American Dream possible for him, noting his own rise from public housing to founding a business and later running the nation’s largest healthcare company.\n\nMamdani, a member of the New York State Assembly who won the Democratic primary for New York City mayor earlier this summer, has drawn national attention because of his socialist platform. In recent years, he has advocated for government-run grocery stores, the abolition of private property, and what he called the “end goal” of “seizing the means of production.” The Democratic Socialists of America have described Mamdani as one of their strongest allies in elected office, and party leaders openly acknowledge their role in shaping his platform.\n\nRep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) put forth the “MAMDANI Act” earlier this year to examine the effects of city-run grocery stores, warning the plan could disrupt food prices and supply chains nationwide. Lawler said Mamdani’s proposals were “straight out of the Marxist playbook.”\n\nEven within his own party, Mamdani has drawn mixed reactions. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) defended him under the “big tent” banner of the Democratic Party, saying in July that “the bigger the tent, the more likely it is that we can reach the greatest number of Americans.” But other Democrats, including Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-NY), have distanced themselves. Suozzi suggested Mamdani and other socialists “create their own party” and warned that socialism has “failed everywhere throughout the United States of America.”\n\nScott has positioned himself as one of the Senate’s leading opponents of socialism. In past statements, he called Vice President Kamala Harris’s push for price controls “pure socialism” and warned against left-wing movements like the teachers’ union-backed “RedforEd” campaign.","summary":"Sen.
