After hours of peaceful demonstrations, dozens of protesters broke through part of the perimeter security fence, drawing riot police to the site, a Reuters witness said. The DNC security team did not respond to a request for comment on whether the protesters were arrested. \"Law enforcement personnel are currently on scene and more information will be provided when available,\" said a Chicago city spokesperson. Chanting intensified ahead of the fence breach, as protesters reached a neighborhood park on Chicago's West Side and paused to amplify their calls for a ceasefire. Amid the noise, the crowd turned its frustration toward Vice President Kamala Harris, referring to the Democratic candidate as \"Killer Kamala\". Chicago police formed a perimeter around the park on foot to contain protesters, with some police personnel on bikes. Still, the umbrella group \"March on the DNC\" drew fewer supporters than expected to a park outside the convention arena, hours before Biden was to address the gathering. They started a one-mile march near where Democratic delegates will nominate Harris as their candidate to face Republican Donald Trump in November's presidential election. Organizers had expected tens of thousands of protesters - enough to fill the park and the march route - Hatem Abudayyeh, a spokesman for March on the DNC, said early Monday. By afternoon though, several thousand protesters had gathered for speeches and the park was only half full. The coalition of more than 200 groups includes those advocating for a variety of causes from reproductive rights to racial justice. Many people were coming from Palestinian and Arab communities in Illinois and neighboring states, organizers said last week. Roman Fritz, at 19 one of the youngest Wisconsin delegates, wore a scarf imprinted with the traditional Palestinian keffiyeh pattern. He planned to participate in the march but had no plans to disrupt the official events later, and said he supported Harris as the party nominee to beat Trump. Dozens of Muslim delegates and their allies, angry at U.S. support for Israel's offensive in Gaza, are seeking changes in the Democratic platform and plan to press for an arms embargo, putting the party on guard for disruptions to high-profile speeches at the convention. Some protesters were doubtful that the party will change its platform. \"It'll never happen,\" said Mwalimu Sundiata Keita, who traveled from Cincinnati, Ohio, to join the protest. \"It's the policy of the party to support Israel, and until that policy changes, that's the way it's going to be.\" Senan Shaqdeh, 54, a member of the executive committee of the Palestinian American Organizations Network, said additional buses from as far away as Florida were expected to deliver more protesters to the site of the march throughout the day. \"The Democratic Party should not expect business as usual,\" Shaqdeh said. Another large protest was scheduled for Thursday, when Harris is due to formally accept the nomination. Pro-Palestinian groups have for months protested the Biden administration's military and financial support for Israel during its war against Hamas, which has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza health officials. Israel launched the offensive after it was attacked on Oct. 7 by Hamas militants who killed 1,200 people, according to Israel tallies. The protests swelled on U.S. college campuses in the spring, with police clearing student encampments, at times after confrontations between protesters and counterprotesters. \"The Democrats are the ones in power,\" Abudayyeh said on Monday. \"It's their war. They're responsible for it, they're complicit, and they can stop it.\" © Thomson Reuters 2024.","summary":"Thousands of mostly peaceful pro-Palestinian protesters marched in Chicago Monday as President Joe Biden arrived for the opening day of the Democratic National Convention, in a show of…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/thousands-march-against-gaza-war-at-democratic-convention","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/e1/50/e48d6e365376ed9646aa6702310b675f3385/tagreuters/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-20 00:00:33","author":"Andrea Shalal,Japan Today Editor","authors":["Andrea Shalal","Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":254470644,"title":"WATCH LIVE: AOC speaks during first night of DNC","text":"Rep.

As the larger group marched, a few dozen who broke away tore down pieces of the security fence. Some protesters, dressed in black with their faces covered, dragged pieces of the fence back to a park near the United Centre in Chicago, Illinois where the convention is being held. Several protesters who had managed to get through the fence were detained and handcuffed by the police. Authorities said the inner security perimeter surrounding convention site was not breached and there was no threat to those attending the convention. Members of the crowd chanted “End the occupation now” and then “The whole world is watching!” just as anti-Vietnam war protesters did during the infamous 1968 convention in Chicago when police clashed with protesters on live television. Officers put on gas masks as some protesters tried to bring down a second fence set up in front of police. The march happened just as US President Joe Biden, who has been the target of intense criticism from pro-Palestinian groups, including the marchers, was doing a walk-through of the largely empty United Centre. Biden was expected to address the party in the evening. “Biden, you can’t hide. We charge you with genocide,” the marchers chanted amid the beating of drums. They also referred to him as “Genocide Joe” and lodged similar chants at Vice-President Kamala Harris. Protesters said their plans have not changed since Biden left the race and the party quickly rallied behind Harris, who will formally accept the Democratic nomination this week. Activists said they were ready to amplify their progressive message before the nation’s top Democratic leaders. “We have to play our part in the belly of the beast to stop the genocide, to end US aid to Israel and stand with Palestine,” said Hatem Abudayyeh, a spokesman for the Coalition to March on the DNC, which includes hundreds of organisations. The heavy police presence at the march included Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling, who walked in a group of officers ahead of the protesters. Mayor Brandon Johnson said authorities were well prepared. “The city of Chicago is really good at things like this,” he told a news conference. “We are ready.” Organisers had hoped at least 20,000 people would take part in Monday’s rally and march, but it appeared that only a few thousand were present when the march began, though city officials declined to give a crowd estimate. “We’re proud of the turnout, especially considering the degree of the repression from the city,” said organiser Faayani Aboma Mijana. The Chicago area has one of the largest Palestinian communities in the nation, and buses were bringing activists from all over the country. Taylor Cook, an organiser with the Freedom Road Socialist Organisation, travelled from Atlanta for the march. Cook said the group was pushing all Democrats to call for an end to aid to Israel, with a particular focus on Harris. “We’re saying to Kamala, she has been complicit in this. People think it’s just Joe Biden, but she is vice-president,” Cook said. “So we’re saying, you need to stop if you want our vote.” Medea Benjamin, who travelled to Chicago from Washington with a women-led group of protesters calling for peace, said she was shocked that the Biden administration recently approved an additional US$20 billion in weapons sales to Israel. “There’s an incredible discrepancy in what people are calling for in this country and what the administration is doing,” she said ahead of the rally in Union Park. “We’re so disgusted by this.” Pro-Palestinian supporters descended on the park, west of the Loop business district, for the rally. Before the march, independent presidential candidate Cornel West addressed the crowd, which welcomed him with cheers. “This is not about some Machiavellian politics or some utilitarian calculation about an election,” he shouted into a microphone. “This is about morality. This is about spirituality.” Around 40 pro-Israel supporters walked around the park during the rally. Remaining mostly silent while waving Israeli flags, they were accompanied by about 20 police officers on bicycles. Although tensions flared at times, there were no physical altercations. Josh Weiner, co-founder of Chicago Jewish Alliance who walked with the pro-Israel group, said their intent was to “make our presence felt”. He said the group applied for permits that were not approved by the city. “The pro-Palestine protesters have gotten multiple permits, including a march, which seems to be a little bit weighted on one side,” Weiner said. Snelling praised police and march organisers for a peaceful Sunday night protest calling for abortion and LGBTQ rights and an end to the war in Gaza. Chicago police said two people were arrested on misdemeanour charges of resisting police and damaging property. “Listen, it’s this simple. The Chicago Police Department is here to protect everyone in this city,” Snelling said. “What we will not tolerate is intimidation. We will not tolerate violence.”","summary":"Several protesters who had managed to get through the fence near the site of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago were arrested.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3275110/gaza-war-protesters-break-through-security-fence-near-dnc-site-opening-day","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/08/20/230068a8-ed61-4031-b344-737322f4c058_cf364fed.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/08/07/web%20version%20walz%20china.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:59:24","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.213},{"id":254470410,"title":"Cornel West and Sister Harris have conflicting views on the Israel-Hamas conflict","text":"Cornel West, an independent presidential candidate, joined pro-Palestinian protestors at the Democratic National Convention to demand an end to what they describe as genocide funded by Democrats. The March on the DNC is the first of two events this week in Chicago and was expected to draw tens of thousands of demonstrators, organizers say. The March on the DNC comprises various organizations advocating for different social causes, all united by a pro-Palestine stance. The protests highlight the death toll of over 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza following Israel’s offensive against Hamas reported by the Associated Press. West, vying to be included on presidential ballots as an independent candidate, emphasizes that his position on the Gaza conflict sets him apart from Vice President Kamala Harris, set to be nominated by the Democrats in Chicago on Thursday. “She and I come out of a long tradition of Black folks from both Jamaica and the United States with Martin Luther King, Jr., Fannie Lou Hamer, and Malcolm X who always made the connection between having a moral authority, which means if you have any moral authority, you call a genocide into question,” West told reporters, including from , on Monday. “If you have any moral authority, you speak to the issues of poverty and wealth inequality in a substantiative way and mass incarceration.

Democrats will make history this week in nominating Vice President Kamala Harris as their choice for president — the first Black woman and Asian-American to secure the nomination in the party’s nearly 200-year-old history. Democratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison and convention chair Minyon Moore, who are both Black, kicked off the event with remarks spotlighting past Black leaders who set the stage for Harris’ run. “Every convention is a moment. It’s a moment that contributes to our movement,” he said, praising activist Fannie Lou Hamer and the first woman to run for president as a Democrat, Shirley Chisholm. “All of these moments led us to this transformational moment when a Black convention chair and a Black DNC chair lead us in nominating a Black and AAPI woman to be the next president of the United States,” Harrison said. Harrison and his sons, age 9 and 5, lead the convention in the Pledge of Allegiance Civil rights icon Jesse Jackson was also honored at the event, and the 82 year old’s appearance, aided by a wheelchair, brought some convention goers to tears. Jackson several times attempted to secure the Democratic nomination for the presidency, but despite falling short in that pursuit, speakers credited Jackson’s determination for leading the way to former President Obama’s success and now, to Harris.

The Democratic National Convention released the final 2024 Democratic Party platform Sunday night, after the one created during President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign was eventually scrapped. Vice President Kamala Harris announced her own presidential bid shortly after, generating a need for revisions that would better align with her own policy positions and a new vision for the party. The latest party platform mimics the Biden administration’s attempted rule making on Title IX to widen the definition of sex discrimination to include gender identity. \"After Friday’s SCOTUS order, the Biden-Harris Title IX rules are in effect in less than 50% of the country — underscoring the flagrant lawlessness of this policy, as well as the deep unpopularity of this issue,\" Nicole Neily, the president and founder of parental rights group Parents Defending Education, told Fox News Digital. \"Americans agree on relatively little these days, but opposition to progressive gender policies is one of the few issues that transcends racial, political, and socioeconomic lines — so doubling down on this issue is a risky move.\" Matt Sharp, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian nonprofit that also focuses on parental rights issues, said the decision to include transgender protections in the Democratic Party’s platform \"flies in the face of growing opinion\" about expanding the definition of sex discrimination to include gender identity. \"I think it's really concerning to see the DNC platform sort of keep going down this same path that courts time and time again have pushed back on, have not allowed to move forward, and that ultimately the American public is not in favor of,\" Sharp said. CAITLYN JENNER SAYS SCOTUS RULING AGAINST BIDEN-HARRIS TITLE IX CHANGE IS ‘GREAT NEWS’ FOR WOMEN'S SPORTS Sharp pointed out how efforts to redefine sex and sexual discrimination go all the way back to President Barack Obama’s administration. Once Trump took office, he rolled back the rule, but then it was put back in place by Biden. \"This has been a continuing pattern for several administrations to push this, but not only are the courts rebuffing it, but that the American public themselves are too, and we're seeing it through more and more courageous female voices standing up against this,\" Sharp said. Reed D. Rubinstein, senior vice president at America First Legal, the right-wing legal organization founded by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, called the move to add protections for transgender students under Title IX \"old news.\" \"The left has fought this reality for well over a decade — it has repeatedly attempted and repeatedly failed to amend Title IX in Congress. Twice, it has attempted to change the law by administrative fiat. To protect girls’ sports, bathrooms, and locker rooms, the Trump administration reversed the Obama administration’s ‘Dear Colleague’ letter that asserted ‘sex’ and ‘[gender identity’ are coextensive],\" Rubinstein told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"The Trump administration issued a Title IX rule that survived every single left-wing court challenge. Now, the courts have stopped the Biden-Harris administration’s attempt to rewrite the statute by regulation. But the Supreme Court, unanimously, has made it clear the word ‘sex’ in Title IX does not mean ‘gender identity,’ but rather, biological sex, male or female. Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment but did not receive a response. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In addition to Title IX protections for transgender students, the DNC party platform also contains language that states Democrats will continue \"to relieve the crippling burden of student debt\" in 2024 — another policy effort under Biden that was rolled back by the Supreme Court. The platform blames Republicans for \"block[ing] our student debt relief.\" The Supreme Court ruled against the Biden administration’s plans for student debt cancelation last year, arguing the president stepped outside the bounds of his authority when he announced a plan to cancel up to $400 billion in student loans through executive action.","summary":"Delegates at the Democratic National Convention Monday passed/did not pass/voted on the Democratic Party’s 2024 policy platform, which included “explicit&quot; Title IX protections for LGBT students that were just blocked by the Supreme Court.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dnc-policy-platform-slammed-over-explicit-title-ix-protections-lgbt-students-flagrant-lawlessness","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/08/931/523/Gender-inclusive-environment.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:48:41","author":"Alec Schemmel","authors":["Alec Schemmel"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.215},{"id":254470232,"title":"Democrats approve DNC party platform that hasn’t been updated since Biden dropped out","text":"CHICAGO — Delegates at the Democratic National Convention voted Monday to approve the 2024 party platform, coalescing around a vision for the next four years that had already been written before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. The 92-page document, passed in a largely ceremonial voice vote, repeatedly highlights Biden’s positions and achievements, which may differ slightly from Harris’s. The document was approved by the platform committee on July 16, less than a week after Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris. The platform also mentions Biden’s “second term” 20 times, emphasizing the recency of the campaign shake-up. “It makes a strong statement about the historic work that President Biden and Vice President Harris have accomplished hand-in-hand, and offers a vision for a progressive agenda that we can build on as a nation and as a Party as we head into the next four years,” the Democratic National Committee said in a press release. The platform notably does not mention an arms embargo on Israel, a demand made by uncommitted delegates in addition to the thousands of protesters rallying outside the secure zone near the arena where delegates and officials are gathering. The protests come against the backdrop of developments in negotiations for a ceasefire for the war in Gaza. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday Israel had accepted the United State’s ceasefire proposal. The next step is for Hamas to accept, with further negotiations expected to take place later in the week. The document emphasizes a “strong, secure and democratic Israel is vital to the interests of the United States” while also committing to Israel’s security and right to defend itself. The platform also notes Biden’s support for a foreign aid package for Israel and Ukraine that was passed by Congress earlier this year, which included $17 billion in security aid for the Jewish state. It also discusses a two-state solution after Gaza is reconstructed “in a manner that does not allow Hamas to rearm.” “It would create the conditions for a better future for the Palestinian people, one of self-determination, dignity, security, and freedom, and ultimately a state of their own — a contrast to [former president Donald] Trump, who refuses to endorse the political aspirations of the Palestinian people.” “There’s some language in the platform that we find helpful, some language that we don’t,” said Abbas Alawieh, a DNC uncommitted delegate from Michigan, mentioning efforts by progressive activists to add a clause to the party platform rejecting U.S. aid to Israel. “What is more important to us is what Vice President Harris leads us towards now that she is the candidate,” Alawieh said. “That platform had been worked on before the Vice President was the candidate. We need to hear from her how she plans to differentiate her policy from the disastrous policy of the last 10 months, and importantly, from … Trump’s very destructive plans.” Harris has offered a more sympathetic tone, acknowledging the suffering of both the Israeli and Palestinian people during a solo meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month, pledging not to “look away in the face of these tragedies.” Even some delegates who are supporting the Harris-Walz ticket hoped there would be some changes to the platform now that Biden is no longer at the top of the ticket. “I think it’s important to emphasize that what we are asking for is an arms embargo, and that is the best move for the Harris campaign politically,” said Liano Sharon, a Michigan delegate from Lansing. “There’s tons of data that demonstrates that the people in the country want an arms embargo.” This platform specifically mentions building on the Abraham Accords, a series of normalization agreements between Israel and Arab nations brokered by the Trump administration. The document now notes that Biden wants to build on it through a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Many Democratic delegates are satisfied with the language even though Biden is no longer at the top of the ticket. “Joe Biden has made it clear from day one, he’s not a Jew, but he is a Zionist,” said Daniel Hernandez, an Arizona delegate. “I think for us, we have seen unprecedented levels of support for the State of Israel and for their security.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER “I think that’s the takeaway message here, that the Democratic party and Joe Biden and the Biden Harris administration and now the Harris-Walz future administration hopefully will continue to be a strong partner with our one ally in the Middle East,” Hernandez said.

Key Background On Aug. 10, the Trump campaign said it was the victim of a hack “from foreign sources hostile to the United States” and pointed to a Microsoft report published shortly before then that found Iran-affiliated groups are engaging in disinformation and hacking to interfere in the upcoming election. At the time the Trump campaign first blamed Iran for its hack, it did not present evidence, but the Microsoft report had identified a spear-phishing email sent in June to a high-ranking official of an unnamed presidential campaign. Politico first reported the hack after it began receiving emails from an “anonymous account with documents from inside Trump’s operation,” including a research document from February labeled “potential vulnerabilities” on Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, who was later named Trump’s running mate. The FBI confirmed to multiple outlets last Monday it was investigating the hack after the Trump team alleged Iran was behind it, but gave few details into its investigation. Big Number 3. That’s at least how many staffers on the Biden-Harris campaign received phishing emails that were designed to gain access to the recipients’ communications before Vice President Kamala Harris took over the campaign, The Washington Post reported. Investigators reportedly did not find any of the attempts had been successful. Tangent The intelligence community noted the tactics used by Iran in the hack were “not new.” The statement continued: “Iran and Russia have employed these tactics not only in the United States during this and prior federal election cycles but also in other countries around the world,” likely referencing the 2016 presidential election, when officials said Russian hackers obtained thousands of emails from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the Democratic National Committee and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign that they ultimately released on a website with the intention of helping Trump win the White House.

(Photo by MIKE SEGAR/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) POOL/AFP via Getty Images Key Facts The platform—which was approved by the party platform committee July 16, five days before Biden dropped out—is written as though Biden is still the presumptive nominee and details a continuation of his policies, mentioning the president nearly 300 times, compared to just over two dozen mentions of Harris. Much of the document is dedicated to criticizing former President Donald Trump and drawing a contrast between him and Biden—Trump’s name appears 150 times in document, which states the former president “has a very different vision” from Democrats, “one focused . . . on revenge and retribution, not on the American people, but on himself.” The platform reiterates Biden’s call for a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians and touts his push for an “immediate and lasting ceasefire deal” to end the war between Israel and Hamas, along with the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people and a $14 billion aid package for Israel that Biden signed into law, but it does not mention an arms embargo on Israel—a key demand for pro-Palestinian protesters and the “uncommitted” delegates who opposed Biden’s nomination in protest of his Israel-Hamas war policies. The platform repeats Democrats’ push for a $15 minimum wage for all workers and highlights the increase in minimum wage under Biden to $17.20 an hour for federal contractors, along with his administration’s proposal for a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers—Harris on Friday proposed up to $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers. It calls for a minimum 25% income tax rate for billionaires and promises to tamp down on life insurance “tax shelters” and various other tax loopholes used by wealthy Americans, while “reviving [IRS] enforcement against wealthy and corporate tax cheats.” The platform vows to protect access to abortion by fighting restrictions in court, easing access to abortion medication and supporting abortion-related legal defense services, while attacking Trump for his role in Roe v. Wade’s reversal, alleging he “undermined access to contraception as president” and “opened the door to laws that rip away access” to in vitro fertilization. What To Watch For Biden’s daughter, Ashley Biden, is expected to introduce her father ahead of his speech at the DNC on Monday. Harris and First Lady Jill Biden are expected to join the president onstage. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will also speak on opening night. Key Background The convention convenes in Chicago less than a month after Biden dropped out of the race on July 21 and Harris became the party’s presumptive nominee. More than 99% of delegates formally voted to place her and vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at the top of the ticket on Aug. 6 in a virtual roll call—a formality typically reserved for the convention, though Democrats will still hold a ceremonial roll call to recognize Harris and Walz’s nomination. The convention comes as Democrats have been reenergized by Harris’ entrance into the race following weeks of division and panic in the wake of Biden’s June 27 debate with Trump.

Although the Trump campaign and private-sector cybersecurity investigators had previously said Iran was behind the hacking attempts, it was the first time the U.S. government had assigned blame for the attack. The joint statement from the FBI and other federal agencies also indicated that Iran was responsible for attempts to hack Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, saying hackers had “sought access to individuals with direct access to the Presidential campaign of both political parties.” The goal of the hacking and other activities, federal officials said, was not only to sow discord but also to shape the outcome of elections that Iran perceives to be “particularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests.” “We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting Presidential campaigns,” said the statement, which in addition to the FBI was also released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The statement largely confirms the findings of private companies like Microsoft, which earlier this month issued a report detailing foreign agents’ attempts to interfere in this year’s election, and Google, which separately said that an Iranian group linked to the country’s Revolutionary Guard has tried to infiltrate the personal email accounts of roughly a dozen people linked to President Joe Biden and Trump since May.

While the opposing party gathers in Chicago for the Democratic National Convention Aug. 19–22, the Republican presidential team, Trump and Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), “will bring their America First message to voters,” a news release said. In addition, Trump surrogates will conduct daily press conferences in Chicago to get out their side of the story, the campaign said, and other events will be held in various swing states. “As they meet Americans where they are in battleground states across the country, President Trump and Senator Vance will remind voters that under their leadership, we can end inflation, protect our communities from violent criminals, secure the border, and Make America Great Again,” campaign spokespersons Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a news release. The Trump campaign continues to point out that their political opponents—Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz—have held no news conferences in nearly a month since they emerged as the opposing party’s presidential ticket. Republicans chose Trump and Vance as the candidates at their party’s convention in Milwaukee last month, days after Trump survived an assassination attempt. “As he demonstrated tremendous strength and resolve following an attempt on his life, President Trump’s convention focused on the policies and leadership to which Americans are desperate to return,” the Trump campaign said. Each day this week, the campaign will focus on a different theme. On Aug. 19, Trump and Vance will both campaign in Pennsylvania and discuss how they'd “Make America Wealthy Again.” On Aug. 20, in Wisconsin, the theme will be their “Make America Safe Again” agenda.

Doritos acquired. I got you, @KamalaHarris,” her running mate Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) said in a social post with a video of him finding a bag of Doritos and handing it to her while at the Sheetz store. Another video circulated of Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, the second gentleman, finding the Doritos bag first and handing it to her moments after entering the store. In the video of Walz handing her the Doritos bag, Emhoff is seen holding a Doritos bag while standing next to the vice president in an aisle, which has some critics speculating that Harris was filmed getting Doritos twice. “CAUGHT: The Kamala Doritos thing at Sheetz was so fake they filmed it twice, once with Doug, once with Tim. Notice on the ‘official’ clip Tim ‘finds’ her a bag but she’s already holding one. She forgot to put it down. Totally scripted,” one person on social media claimed, posting a montage of Harris getting Doritos with Walz and separately from Emhoff. Donald Trump Jr., son of Harris’s presidential election rival and former President Donald Trump, mocked Harris and Walz on social media. “Weird and cringe,” he said in his posting of Harris grabbing a Doritos bag from Walz. “Everything they do is fake. Nothing is genuine,” another person said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. “Did Kamala Harris just Google ‘most popular chip in America’ and click on the first result to launch her newfound obsession with Doritos or as she calls them ‘Door-Eat-Ohs’? She’s mentioned them twice in the past three days now,” another critic chimed in. The Harris campaign stop at Sheetz coincided with the convenience store chain being in the middle of a federal lawsuit from the Biden administration for allegedly discriminating against minority job applicants. When President Joe Biden was campaigning as the leading Democratic presidential candidate in April, he also did a photo op at a Pittsburgh-area Sheetz store before his administration hit the company with the lawsuit. Trump 2024 deputy communications director Caroline Sunshine remarked that no members of the press asked Harris any questions and called it overall “an odd video.” “What an odd video — looking for a bag of Doritos. I’m not sure Kamala Harris can tell you what the price of a bag of Doritos is,” Sunshine said on Fox News on Monday. The viral video of Harris’s Sheetz stop also follows her campaign releasing a fundraising email on Friday that tells the story of the vice president eating a family-sized bag of nacho Doritos after former President Donald Trump won in 2016. “I went home and I sat on the couch with a family-sized bag of nacho Doritos,” Harris said in the the campaign email. “I did not share one chip with anybody,” Harris continued in the fundraising email. “Not even [my husband] Doug [Emhoff]. I just watched the TV with utter shock and dismay. Two things are true eight years later: I still love Doritos and we still have not stopped fighting.” Former Fox News personality Elizabeth Hasselbeck ripped Harris for binge-eating Doritos in 2016 over Trump’s win. “That’s the emotional response of the leader of the free world? To binge eat a bag of Doritos? Are you kidding me?” Hasselbeck said. “Can you imagine Putin, how he deals with things? Chugging down a bag of Sour Patch Kids because he’s depressed about something not going his way?” On the Republican presidential campaign side, former President Donald Trump’s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), has received criticism from Harris supporters for enjoying Diet Mountain Dew. During Trump’s press conference on Thursday, Trump talked about enjoying Cheerios.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris made a stop at a Sheetz gas station convenience store while campaigning in Pennsylvania on Sunday, and some critics are questioning the authenticity of her new obsession with the popular Doritos brand after two different videos began circulating on social media. &#8220;Every road trip needs a snack break.

What Legal Analysts Say","text":"Former President Donald Trump shared a series of images on Truth Social Sunday night suggesting that superstar Taylor Swift and a group of her followers called \"Swifties for Trump\" had endorsed him in the 2024 presidential election.Many of the images, including one of the singer-songwriter dressed as Uncle Sam with the caption, \"Taylor Swift Wants You To Vote For Donald Trump,\" appear to have been generated by artificial intelligence.He wrote in one of the captions, \"I accept!\"In 2020, Swift backed the campaign of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and there is certainly no love lost between her and former President Trump, whom she has accused of \"stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism.\"Swift, however, has yet to endorse any presidential candidate this election cycle.The posts were met with outrage on social media, both by Trump's critics and fans of the megastar singer-songwriter. Some legal analysts believe Swift has grounds to sue the Republican nominee over the AI-manipulated \"false endorsement.\"\"I hope this inspires every Taylor Swift fan to vote for Harris. And every music fan. And every person who cares about an artist's image & prestige stole by a criminal politician. And everyone who supports women's rights. Oh, and I hope Ms. Swift sues Trump back to the Stone Age,\" attorney and former U.S. Army prosecutor Glenn Kirschner wrote on X, formerly Twitter.One of the images in Trump's post—of a woman in a white \"Swifties for Trump\" T-shirt—is not fake. One image showed Jenna Piwowarczyk wearing the homemade T-shirt to a Trump rally in Racine, Wisconsin, in June. Piwowarczyk went on to explain her decision to start the movement in a YouTube video.\"By focusing more on the AI photos than on the REAL person in the photos that Trump shared, I think the media are missing an opportunity to recognize that, of all the millions of Taylor Swift fans, of course there will be many who support Trump and conservative values and also love her music. We exist. We are real,\" Piwowarczyk wrote in a statement shared by Wisconsin Right Now, a Wisconsin-focused news platform, on X.There is also evidence of an online \"Swifties for Trump\" movement. In a TikTok video posted by user @trendyandspendy, a woman can be seen posing in a bright pink MAGA hat.In an emailed statement to Newsweek Monday night, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung wrote, \"Swifties for Trump is a massive movement that grows bigger every single day. While [Democratic nominee] Kamala Harris is guilty as sin for all the hurt she has caused every American.\"Newsweek contacted Swift's representatives for comment by email Monday afternoon.Jessica Silbey, a professor at Boston University School of Law and an intellectual property and constitutional law expert, told Billboard Monday that Trump's fake endorsement post likely violates Swift's right of publicity, which controls how your name, image and likeness are used by others.\"Everyone enjoys a right of publicity,\" Silbey told Billboard. \"This kind of use—being made to say and seen as believing things you don't—is at the core of the right.\"Sibley also told Billboard that Swift could look to sue Trump or his campaign for defamation over claims that the false presidential endorsement harmed her reputation.Last month, a bi-partisan NO FAKES Act was introduced in the Senate that aims to protect individuals' voices and likenesses from AI-generated replicas. The act would \"hold individuals or companies liable for damages for producing, hosting, or sharing a digital replica of an individual performing in an audiovisual work, image, or sound recording that the individual never actually appeared in or otherwise approved—including digital replicas created by generative artificial intelligence (AI), according to a press release on Democratic Senator Chris Coons' website.In addition, 10 states, including Swift's home state of Tennessee, have enacted legislation to regulate deepfakes, which could give her additional room to sue Trump or his campaign.Neama Rahmani, president and founder of West Coast Trial Lawyers, told Business Insider, \"Swift could sue Trump and those who misappropriated her likeness by creating AI-generated images.\" He continued, \"Privacy torts protect people from having their name, image, or likeness used without their permission. Manipulating it using AI doesn't change things.\"Rahmani pointed to the tenacity of Swift's lawyers and said, \"I wouldn't be surprised if they send the Trump campaign a cease-and-desist letter at a minimum,\" he told Business Insider.James Walker Jr., an entertainment attorney who represents the estate of Isaac Hayes, recently filed a copyright infringement notice demanding the Trump campaign pay $3 million in licensing fees for using Hayes' composition, \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\" at his campaign rallies.Walker told Business Insider that he believes Swift should pursue legal action.\"Taylor Swift is a billion-dollar brand,\" Walker said. \"She probably has her name trademarked, just like Aretha Franklin and others I've represented own their trademarks. You have to protect your brand, your trademark, and when you don't respond immediately, that's conveying that you're accepting this, and then others will do it.''Paul Michael Wilson, a trademark expert at Walker & Associates, cited to Business Insider that the Lanham Act of 1946, the federal legislation in place that controls and regulates trademark laws in the United States, gives Swift legal grounds to sue Trump.\"This is really bad—somebody should have told him not to do that,\" Wilson laughed as he spoke with Business Insider. \"Like, really?\"However, suing Trump over just one image or a series of posts would certainly be arduous and expensive. Some legal analysts wonder if a defamation or copyright lawsuit —and the publicity that would surround the action—would be worth it for Swift.Woodrow Hartzog, also a professor at Boston University School of Law, told Billboard that he's \"skeptical the juice would be worth the squeeze.\" He added, however, that Swift could take on Trump with a real 2024 endorsement, potentially of his opponent, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\"I think Swift probably has more effective political rather than legal recourse here,\" Hartzog told Billboard.","summary":"Many legal analysts urge pop superstar Taylor Swift to protect her brand after Donald Trump's posting of a \"false endorsement.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-taylor-swift-endorsement-ai-lawsuit-1941420","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2453247/trump-swift.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:34:43","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.242},{"id":254469694,"title":"US intelligence officials confirm Iran hacked Trump campaign","text":"Top intelligence officials confirmed Monday that Iran was behind a hack of former President Donald Trump’s campaign and attempts to infiltrate accounts associated with President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign efforts.

In a joint statement Monday, the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Iran was behind attempts this year to hack presidential campaigns of both political parties. “We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting Presidential campaigns,” the agencies said in the statement. “This includes the recently reported activities to compromise former President Trump’s campaign, which the IC [intelligence community] attributes to Iran,” the statement continued. “The IC is confident that the Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the Presidential campaigns of both political parties. Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the U.S. election process. It is important to note that this approach is not new. Iran and Russia have employed these tactics not only in the United States during this and prior federal election cycles but also in other countries around the world.” The same hackers were alleged by Google to have targeted the Biden-Harris campaign before President Joe Biden ended his run for re-election, but it’s not clear whether they were breached. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ campaign previously said it had no indication it was hacked. The agencies said the FBI continues to investigate. “Protecting the integrity of our elections from foreign influence or interference is our priority,” the agencies said. “As the lead for threat response, the FBI has been tracking this activity, has been in contact with the victims, and will continue to investigate and gather information in order to pursue and disrupt the threat actors responsible. We will not tolerate foreign efforts to influence or interfere with our elections, including the targeting of American political campaigns.” Iran’s mission to the United Nations didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Iranian state news has previously reported that a representative for the mission had denied the country was involved in trying to hack Trump’s campaign. “Iran has furthermore demonstrated a longstanding interest in exploiting societal tensions through various means, including through the use of cyber operations to attempt to gain access to sensitive information related to U.S. elections,” the statement said. Three American news outlets — Politico, The New York Times and The Washington Post — said this month they had received documents that appeared to have been stolen from the Trump campaign. A spokesperson for the campaign claimed the documents were part of an Iranian “hack-and-leak” operation to hurt Trump’s election chances. Last week, the FBI announced it was investigating attempts to hack both parties. On Wednesday, Google published a detailed report on an Iranian hacker group, saying it targeted both the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns in May and June. The U.S. previously blamed Iran for the largest election influence operation ahead of 2020, a convoluted operation to send harassing emails to Democrats in Florida to make it seem as if they were being threatened by the Proud Boys, a far-right group that supports Trump.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe U.S. government has formally endorsed former President Donald Trump’s claim that&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The U.S. verifies Trump campaign&#8217;s statement about being hacked by Iranian hackers first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/the-u-s-verifies-trump-campaigns-statement-about-being-hacked-by-iranian-hackers/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-US-confirms-Trump-campaign-claim-it-was.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:27:40","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":254469984,"title":"U.S. says Iran cyber operations targeted Trump, Harris campaigns","text":"WASHINGTON >> The United States on Monday accused Iran of launching cyber operations against the campaigns of both U.S. presidential candidates and targeting the American public with influence operations aimed at fanning political discord. “We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle,” said a statement by the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which oversees the defense of government computer systems. The statement confirmed charges made earlier this month by the campaign of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that Iran hacked one of its websites, triggering an FBI investigation. At that time, Trump said Iran was “only able to get publicly available information.” Iran, the U.S. statement said, also has targeted the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, who is to officially accept the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination at this week’s convention. Iran’s mission to the United Nations issued a statement calling the allegations “unsubstantiated and devoid of any standing. As we have previously announced, the Islamic Republic of Iran harbors neither the intention nor the motive to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.” The U.S. statement said Iran has conducted influence operations targeting the American public in a bid to fan political divisions and “cyber operations targeting presidential campaigns.” “This includes the recently reported activities to compromise former President Trump’s campaign, which the IC (intelligence community) attributes to Iran,” it continued. It said the intelligence community is confident Iranian operatives using social engineering and other means “sought access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaigns of both parties,” the statement said.

During a Sunday interview on CNN, the former adviser to the Obama White House warned Democrats not to take too much comfort in the “euphoria” fueling Harris’s campaign. “She’s [Harris] right to be telling people it’s good to be enthusiastic,” Axelrod noted as he reflected on the momentum Harris attracted after replacing President Joe Biden in a last-minute switch at the top of the Democratic ticket. “But you have to turn that into energetic action in order to win the election,” Axelrod said. Axelrod added that Harris needs to put in more concrete work to pull voters in battleground states into her fold to secure an Electoral College win on Election Day. “I’ve said several times here that, you know, for [a] Democrat to win those battleground states, they have to have a significant lead in the Electoral College,” he reminded his party. The United States chooses presidents using the Electoral College system. Harris and former President Donald Trump are vying to persuade voters in battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, and Georgia to support their campaigns in a bid to clinch the necessary electoral votes to win the White House. In 2016, Democratic presidential candidate Hilary Clinton won the popular vote but lost the election to Trump because he secured a win in the Electoral College. The same scenario happened in 2000, when Al Gore, the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, lost the election to GOP presidential candidate George Bush despite winning the popular vote. Axelrod said he thinks Trump currently retains an advantage in the presidential race. “If the election were today, I’m not sure who would win, and I think it may well be President Trump because it’s an Electoral College fight,” the Democratic strategist said. The RealClearPolitics average of recent polls indicates Trump is trailing Harris by 1.5%.","summary":"Democratic strategist David Axelrod reminded the Democratic Party that enthusiasm alone for Vice President Kamala Harris isn’t enough to generate a win for her this November.&#160; During a Sunday interview on CNN, the former adviser to the Obama White House warned Democrats not to take too much comfort in the “euphoria” fueling Harris’s campaign.&#160; “She’s [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/3126632/axelrod-warns-harris-needs-energetic-action-turn-democratic-enthusiasm-win/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Harris.-.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:26:55","author":"Emily Hallas","authors":["Emily Hallas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.352},{"id":254469918,"title":"Swiftie for Kamala Harris shows off outfit at DNC, talks about excitement for Harris","text":"Swiftie for Kamala Harris shows off outfit at DNC, talks about excitement for Harris CBS News' Ed O'Keefe spoke to a Taylor Swift fan who came to the Democratic National Convention Monday in an outfit dedicated to the singer and Vice President Kamala Harris.

Taylor Swift Fan Who Started 'Swifties for Trump'","text":"Jenna Piwowarczyk, a student at Concordia College, started a group called \"Swifites for Trump,\" to encourage Taylor Swift fans to vote for former President Donald Trump in this year's presidential election.On Sunday, the former president reposted content on his social media plaftorm Truth Social about the \"Swifties for Trump\" group and even reposted an artificial intelligence (AI)-generated photo of Swift telling people to vote for him. In his caption, Trump wrote: \"I accept!\"Piwowarczyk, 19, celebrated Trump acknowledging the group and said in a video posted to YouTube that she met Trump at a Wisconsin rally in June while wearing her \"Swifties for Trump\" shirt.\"I think this movement is super awesome and also super important because it's no secret that millions of young female voters consider themselves Swifties and we don't want them to have to choose between loving Taylor Swift and supporting conservative ideologies at the ballot box in November,\" Piwowarczyk said in the video.Swift rarely wades into politics and has yet to endorse anyone this election cycle. However, Swift spoke out against Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, in 2018 and endorsed President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2020 presidential election.Piwowarczyk told Newsweek on Monday via email that the response to the group has been \"huge,\" although she doesn't expect Swift to endorse anyone this election cycle. She acknowledged that Swift has fans on both sides of the political aisle and speculated that the recent ISIS terror threat that forced the singer to cancel her concert in Vienna, Austria, wouldn't have happened if Trump was in office.Newsweek polling in May found that 22 percent of Biden's 2020 voters would be more likely to vote for a Republican if Swift endorsed them. It was a 9-point increase from January when a Newsweek poll found only 13 percent of Biden's 2020 supporters would be more likely to vote for a Swift-endorsed Republican candidate.Piwowarczyk has been to six Swift concerts, with her first being during the singer's Red Tour in 2013. Then, she went to the 1989 Tour in 2015 and the Reputation Stadium Tour in 2018. Piwowarczyk has also seen Swift three times in her latest Eras Tour.The 19-year-old grew up in Wisconsin and attended Hartford Union High School, according to records obtained by Newsweek. While in high school she started a chapter of the Young America's Foundation, a nonprofit conservative youth organization.Her father, Jim Piwowarczyk, is the founder of Wisconsin Right Now, a digital news platform based out of Wisconsin. Jenna's written several op-eds for the outlet, including one criticizing a New York Times essay that floated the theory that Swift is a member of the LGBTQ+ community.\"At what point do the ultra-liberal figures, as many see Taylor Swift to be, become not liberal enough? This story has proven that one cannot simply be an ally of the LGBTQ to be accepted or even enough for pop culture- one must be fully submerged in the ideology,\" she wrote early this year.Republicans have been critical of Swift and speculated that she'll do a last minute endorsement of Harris and potentially change the outcome of the election. In a book that was published in June by Variety's co-editor-in-chief Ramin Setoodeh, Trump reportedly said he was surprised that Swift was liberal and asked if she was \"legitimately liberal.\" He added that she's \"beautiful\" and \"talented,\" but that she \"probably doesn't like Trump.\"Nearly one-third of Trump's supporters believe Swift will vote for him in November, according to a Newsweek poll from May. About 40 percent of Trump voters consider themselves Swift fans, compared to 59 percent of Biden's supporters.Jenna, a registered voter, told Newsweek that she describes herself as conservative who votes for \"ideology rather than a party.\"Trump sharing the AI-generated images of Swift sparked strong reactions from her fans. One fan on social media questioned why he'd risk angering Swift, with some legal experts saying the singer could even sue the former president over the images.Jenna told Newsweek that she's had fans reach out to her in support of the \"Swifties for Trump\" group, as well. With a politically diverse fan base, she said Swifties who are supporting Trump are likely doing so because they're getting older and unhappy with the economy.\"My generation is realizing that a Trump administration is needed for a successful future,\" Jenna said.","summary":"Piwowarczyk told Newsweek that she believes Taylor Swift fans will vote for Trump because they're unhappy with the economy.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/who-jenna-piwowarczyk-swifties-trump-taylor-swift-donald-trump-1941495","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2453281/jenna-piwowarczyk-swifties-trump.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:25:48","author":"Jenni Fink","authors":["Jenni Fink"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.141},{"id":254469544,"title":"DNC Day 1: Chicago Mayor Opens Event Ahead Of Biden, Hillary Clinton Speeches (Live Updates)","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson highlighted Vice President Kamala Harris’ history-making candidacy as the first Black woman to head a major party’s presidential ticket in his opening remarks Monday as the Democratic National Convention kicked off in his city, with President Joe Biden set to headline the event’s first night.

Charlie Kirk, a Chicago area native and co-founder of Turning Point USA, sparred with a conventioneer inside the United Center, where Vice President Kamala Harris will be anointed as Democrat’s presidential candidate. Meanwhile, Republican operative Jack Posobiec donned a traditional Middle Eastern headdress Monday while questioning demonstrators at Union Park about abortion. The MAGA darlings both posted their exploits to X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that has become a bastion for conservative figures since Elon Musk took it over in 2022. Kirk and Posobiec didn’t respond to interview requests. In a video posted in the convention hall on Monday, Kirk said he was reporting from “the belly of the beast in Chicago.” “We’re here to learn,” Kirk said with a smile. “I don’t really have much to learn here. But I’ve already gotten heckled once.” Another video Kirk posted earlier Monday showed Parker Short, president of the Young Democrats of Georgia, assailing Kirk about Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in that southern state. “You’re an anti-patriotic, anti-constitutional person crashing our party because you tried to stop our democracy,” Short said. “I got one question,” Kirk shot back. “What is a woman?” “That is so f------ weird,” responded Short, using a dis progressives have lobbed against Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance, as he walked away. “Maybe you should meet one.” Some of Posobiec’s trolling didn’t appear to go over much better. In a clip from Real America’s Voice, a far-right television channel, the naval intelligence officer-turned-Pizzagate conspiracy theorist asked a demonstrator how many abortions she’d had on Monday. “I’m getting paid by George Soros to have an abortion on the stage with no drugs,” the demonstrator said, referencing the billionaire Democrat who has long been a target of conservation native conspiracy theories.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024-democratic-national-convention/2024/08/19/republican-influencers-dnc-charlie-kirk-jack-posobiec-turning-point-usa-united-center-abortion-weird","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cf24410/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2575x1470+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F81%2F56%2F36594e7449bc9c3f3680d23e61fe%2Fkirkco","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:22:05","author":"Sun-Times staff","authors":["Sun-Times staff"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.047},{"id":254469522,"title":"Himpunan besar-besaran di Chicago menjelang DNC","text":"CHICAGO, 19 OGOS – Satu perhimpunan besar-besaran sedang berlangsung di Chicago, Amerika Syarikat (AS) menjelang pembukaan Konvensyen Nasional Demokrat (DNC), lapor Sputnik.

Trump said he “jawboned” over interest rates with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell during his White House term and “it might have had an effect, it might not have had an effect.” “A president certainly can be talking about interest rates because I think I have very good instincts,” he said. “That doesn’t mean I’m calling the shot, but it does mean that I should have a right to be able to talk about it like anybody else.” High interest rates have intensified focus on decision making at the Fed, as mortgage costs have hobbled would-be homeowners. Vice President Kamala Harris last week unveiled her plan to make housing more affordable by offering first-time buyers $25,000 of down payment assistance. Trump called the idea “a big mistake” saying it would cause a bigger shortage of housing and raise home prices. Still, Trump said, “I might do that” when asked whether he would offer anything to prospective house buyers who are struggling to afford a down payment. Giving the executive branch more input would challenge the longstanding practice of allowing the US central bank to conduct monetary policy — namely, by setting interest rates — independent of political actors. Starting during the Clinton administration, presidents of both parties have also refrained from commenting on Fed decisions and interest rates more broadly, to avoid the mis-perception — and market fears — that they were trying influence the central bank. Trump’s appearance on Monday is part of a multi-pronged campaign strategy to counter-program Democrats’ coronation of Harris as their presidential nominee, shore up support in vital swing states, but most importantly, lean in on the economy, an issue that polls show is top of mind for voters and where he’s held an advantage over President Joe Biden and Harris for most of the 2024 cycle. Polls have shown Harris drawing even or surpassing him. Before Harris replaced Biden at the top of the Democrat ticket, a central part of Trump’s campaign strategy had been stirring the nostalgia that voters had exhibited in polls for the pre-Covid-19 economy that he oversaw. At a press conference earlier this month, Trump said the Fed was a “little bit too early and a little bit too late” in adjusting interest rates and that as a businessman, the former president has a “better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman.” He declined on Monday to say who he might appoint as Fed chair, saying “It’s far too early.” The former president has previously said he would not reappoint Powell, whose term as chair ends in 2026. Trump has assailed Powell in the past saying the central bank and its chairman have “No guts, no sense, no vision!” Harris differentiated herself from Trump on central bank autonomy, telling reporters earlier this month she could not disagree “more strongly” with his view on Fed independence and that as president she would “never interfere in the decisions that the Fed makes.” History shows countries that allow politicians to direct monetary policy face higher inflation. In the US, former President Richard Nixon in the early 1970s pushed the Fed chair of the time, Arthur Burns, into easier monetary policy, triggering a costly inflationary boom-bust cycle. Campaign Trail The Republican nominee’s comments on Monday followed a speech on the economy and energy policy during a visit to Pennsylvania, part of a week-long blitz taking him to key swing states in a bid to draw attention away from his opponent, as Harris and her party convene in Chicago for the Democratic National Convention. Trump is ramping up his campaigning this week with visits also planned to Michigan, North Carolina and Arizona and with him and his surrogates planning daily press conferences — a bid to paint a contrast with Harris, who has not yet held a sit-down interview since becoming her party’s nominee. Harris has pledged to do so by the end of the month. Trump visited a machining and fabrication plant in York, Pennsylvania on Monday, highlighting his economic agenda. Republican allies have pressed Trump in recent weeks to focus more on issues such as the economy and immigration — seen as political liabilities for Harris. A Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll released Sunday showed Harris leading Trump 49% to 45% but the former president is ahead by nine percentage points on the issue of the economy. Trump has vowed to renew expiring tax cuts and institute tariffs on both US allies and adversaries if he returns to power.","summary":"High interest rates have intensified focus on decision making at the Fed, as mortgage costs have hobbled would-be homeowners.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/08/19/trump-fed-president-interest-rate-cut-housing-policy/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2167195925-e1724109456866.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:19:43","author":"Bloomberg,Mark Niquette","authors":["Bloomberg","Mark Niquette"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":254469674,"title":"Protesters break through police fence near site of Democratic National Convention","text":"CHICAGO - Protesters broke through a fence set up by police near the site of the Democratic National Convention on its opening day Monday as thousands took to the streets to voice their opposition to the war in Gaza. As the larger group marched, a few dozen who broke away tore down pieces of the security fence. Some protesters, dressed in black with their faces covered, dragged pieces of the fence back to a park near the United Center, where the convention is being held. Members of the crowd chanted “End the occupation now” and then “The whole world is watching!” just as anti-Vietnam War protesters did during the infamous 1968 convention in Chicago when police clashed with protesters on live television. Officers put on gas masks as some protesters tried to bring down a second fence set up in front of police. The march happened just as U.S. President Joe Biden, who has been the target of intense criticism from pro-Palestinian groups, including the marchers, was doing a walk-through of the largely empty United Center. Biden was scheduled to address the party in the evening. “Biden, you can’t hide. We charge you with genocide,” the marchers chanted amid the beating of drums. They also referred to him as “Genocide Joe” and lodged similar chants at Vice-President Kamala Harris. Protesters said their plans have not changed since Biden left the race and the party quickly rallied behind Harris, who will formally accept the Democratic nomination this week. Activists said they were ready to amplify their progressive message before the nation's top Democratic leaders. “We have to play our part in the belly of the beast to stop the genocide, to end U.S. aid to Israel and stand with Palestine,” said Hatem Abudayyeh, a spokesperson for the Coalition to March on the DNC, which includes hundreds of organizations. The heavy police presence at the march included Chicago Police Supt. Larry Snelling, who walked in a group of officers ahead of the protesters. Mayor Brandon Johnson said authorities were well prepared. “The city of Chicago is really good at things like this,” he told a news conference. “We are ready.” Organizers had hoped at least 20,000 people would take part in Monday’s rally and march, but it appeared that only a few thousand were present when the march began, though city officials declined to give a crowd estimate. “We’re proud of the turnout, especially considering the degree of the repression from the city,” said organizer Faayani Aboma Mijana. The Chicago area has one of the largest Palestinian communities in the nation, and buses were bringing activists from all over the country. Taylor Cook, an organizer with the Freedom Road Socialist Organization, traveled from Atlanta for the march. Cook said the group was pushing all Democrats to call for an end to aid to Israel, with a particular focus on Harris. “We’re saying to Kamala, she has been complicit in this. People think it’s just Joe Biden, but she is vice president,” Cook said. “So we’re saying, you need to stop if you want our vote.” Medea Benjamin, who traveled to Chicago from Washington, D.C., with a women-led group of protesters calling for peace, said she was shocked that the Biden administration recently approved an additional US$20 billion in weapons sales to Israel. “There’s an incredible discrepancy in what people are calling for in this country and what the administration is doing,” she said ahead of the rally in Union Park. “We’re so disgusted by this.” Pro-Palestinian supporters descended on the park, west of the Loop business district, for the rally. Prior to the march, independent presidential candidate Cornel West addressed the crowd, which welcomed him with cheers. “This is not about some Machiavellian politics or some utilitarian calculation about an election,” he yelled into a microphone. “This is about morality. This is about spirituality.” Around 40 pro-Israel supporters walked around the park during the rally. Remaining mostly silent while waving Israeli flags, they were accompanied by about 20 police officers on bicycles. Although tensions flared at times, there were no physical altercations. America Votes: Latest U.S. election news and analysis from a Canadian perspective The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App Josh Weiner, co-founder of Chicago Jewish Alliance who walked with the pro-Israel group, said their intent was to “make our presence felt.” He said the group applied for permits that were not approved by the city. “The pro-Palestine protesters have gotten multiple permits, including a march, which seems to be a little bit weighted on one side,” Weiner said. Snelling praised police and march organizers for a peaceful Sunday night protest calling for abortion and LGBTQ+ rights and an end to the war in Gaza. Chicago police said two people were arrested on misdemeanor charges of resisting police and damaging property. “Listen, it’s this simple. The Chicago Police Department is here to protect everyone in this city,” Snelling said. “What we will not tolerate is intimidation. We will not tolerate violence.” Protester issues include climate change, abortion rights and racial equality, to name a few, but many agree that pressing for an immediate cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war is the top message of the demonstrations. They have likened it to the Vietnam War of their generation. Some businesses boarded up their windows as a precaution, and county courts said they would open more space in case of mass arrests. Chicago police say officers have undergone extensive training on constitutional policing and de-escalation tactics. Coalition activists and the city have been at odds over the location of the protests and other logistics. A judge sided with the city over an approximately 1-mile (1.6-kilometer) march route, which organizers argued was not big enough for the expected crowds. Not a single speaker or spectator showed up by early afternoon to a speakers’ stage offered by city officials near the United Center. Eight groups with progressive agendas had signed up for 45-minute speaking slots on Monday. On other days, some conservative groups, including the Illinois Policy Institute think tank, have plans to speak. Also Monday, the Philadelphia-based Poor People’s Army, which advocates for economic justice, planned to set up at Humboldt Park on the city's northwest side to feature events with third-party presidential candidates Jill Stein and West, plus a five-kilometre march.","summary":"Protesters broke through a fence set up by police near the site of the Democratic National Convention on its opening day Monday as thousands took to the streets to voice their opposition to the war in Gaza.","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/protesters-break-through-police-fence-near-site-of-democratic-national-convention-1.7006548","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/8/19/u-s--election---democratic-national-convention-1-7006552-1724109142310.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:18:35","author":"Sophia Tareen, Joey Cappelletti And Lea Skene,The Associated Press","authors":["Sophia Tareen, Joey Cappelletti And Lea Skene","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.015},{"id":254469436,"title":"US Says Iran Responsible For Trump Campaign Hack","text":"Iran was behind a recent hack targeting Donald Trump's presidential campaign, US security agencies said on Monday, accusing Tehran of seeking to influence the 2024 election.The statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed the Trump campaign claim from earlier this month that it had been targeted, potentially by Iran.\"We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting presidential campaigns,\" the security agencies said.\"This includes the recently reported activities to compromise former President Trump's campaign, which the (intelligence community) attributes to Iran,\" they said.The United States goes to the polls on November 5, with both Trump's and rival Kamala Harris's campaigns saying they had been targeted by cyber attacks in recent weeks.

The nearly yearlong investigation by Republicans stops short of alleging any criminal wrongdoing by the president. Instead, the almost 300-page report out Monday, the opening day of the Democratic National Convention, covers familiar ground, asserting the Biden family traded on its “brand” in business ventures in corrupt ways that rise to the Constitution’s high bar for impeachment. With Biden no longer running for reelection, next steps are highly uncertain. House Republicans have not had support from their own ranks to actually impeach the president, and removal by the Senate is even further afield. Many Republicans prefer to focus attention on the Democratic Party’s presumptive presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, with some probes getting underway. The White House has dismissed the House impeachment inquiry as a “stunt” and encouraged House Republicans to “move on.” “The totality of the corrupt conduct uncovered by the Committees is egregious,” wrote the House Oversight and Accountability, Judiciary and Ways & Means panels leading the inquiry. The report said the Constitution’s “remedy for a President’s flagrant abuse of office is clear: impeachment by the House of Representatives and removal by the Senate.” Republicans have spent the better part of their time in the House majority with a hyper focus on Biden and his family’s businesses, encouraged by Donald Trump as the twice impeached and indicted former president makes a comeback bid for the White House. The impeachment inquiry has been a cornerstone of the House GOP’s effort, launched by former Speaker Kevin McCarthy shortly before he was booted from leadership and formalized in December under new Speaker Mike Johnson. Republicans are investigating many aspects of Biden family finances going back to 2009 when he was vice president to Barack Obama. In a statement Monday, Johnson was non-committal on what the House will do with the findings. “We encourage all Americans to read this report,” he said. Through bank records, interviews from some 30 witnesses, whistleblower accounts and millions of documents, House Republicans allege a years-long practice by Hunter Biden and his associates to solicit foreign business deals using the family’s proximity to power in Washington. Much of the focus of the report is not on Biden’s time as president, but on the years when the Biden family was in turmoil after the 2015 death of his oldest son, Beau, and as the vice president was bowing out of elected office, declining to run for president in 2016. All told, the House Republicans allege the Biden family and its associates received some $27 million in business payments from partners or clients in Russia, China and other countries. The report said it is “inconceivable” that President Biden did not understand what was going on. “President Biden participated in a conspiracy to monetize his office of public trust to enrich his family,” the report claims. The report released Monday makes more than 20 mentions of the “Biden-Harris administration,” while previous releases from the committees investigating Biden typically only made direct references to him.","summary":"WASHINGTON — House Republicans have released their initial impeachment inquiry report on President Joe Biden, alleging an abuse of power and obstruction of justice in the financial dealings of his son Hunter Biden and family associates.

Speaking exclusively to The Hollywood Reporter’s Awards Chatter podcast in front of an audience at the San Vicente Bungalows in West Hollywood, Rudolph, who is currently nominated for four Emmys — best comedy guest actress and best original music/lyrics for NBC’s SNL, best comedy actress for Apple TV+’s Loot and best character voiceover for Netflix’s Big Mouth — continued: “My phone has not stopped. It’s like if I had 50 grandmas and they were sending me articles like, ‘This is the thing I saw you were in!’ It’s non-fucking-stop. And it’s fascinating because everybody’s excited about this idea, and I have nothing to do with it. It’s just happening in front of me. It’s wild.” “It’s terribly exciting to be associated with, I’m not going to lie,” she continued, adding, “I could tell it was happening around me when Kamala was running the first time. This just feels a lot bigger. You mentioned Condoleezza Rice [another politician she once impersonated], and I balked because I was like, ‘That wasn’t a good character.’ But in those days, I never really played many political figures because there weren’t any that looked like me. That was just the truth of it. It wasn’t that I wasn’t good enough to play them; I didn’t look like them. So you could not have paid me any amount of money to believe that this would be anything that I would be associated with — someone who’s running for president of the United States. It’s incredible. So I hope it works out; it would be cool.” Rudolph, 52, the daughter of the late “Lovin’ You” singer Minnie Riperton and music producer Richard Rudolph, shot to fame 25 years ago. In 1999, following years of performing with the LA-area improv troupe The Groundlings, she embarked on a seven-season run as one of the greatest cast members in the history of SNL, playing 72 characters — including Donatella Versace, Oprah Winfrey and Beyoncé — over 137 episodes. She co-wrote many of her characters with her friend and fellow Groundlings alum Emily Spivey, and describes many of them as “divas,” in the best sense of the word. After leaving SNL in 2007, Rudolph appeared in sitcoms (Up All Night), variety shows (Maya & Marty) and films (such as 2009’s Away We Go, 2015’s Sisters, 2019’s Wine Country and, most famously, 2011’s Bridesmaids) — while occasionally returning to Studio 8H at 30 Rock to make cameos and, on three occasions, to host her former show. The third time came on May 11 of this year, when Rudolph was asked by Lorne Michaels to host the annual Mother’s Day episode — and wowed viewers from the start by featuring in her opening monologue a hilarious ‘Mother’ song that she co-wrote (modeling it after Madonna’s “Vogue”) and performed throughout the studio’s bowels. Both Rudolph’s guest turn and song are now Emmy-nominated. Ironically, it was a shortlived Amazon dramedy series, 2018’s Forever, that introduced her to the two people who would create the greatest acting vehicle she has had yet outside of SNL. The co-creators of that series, Matt Hubbard and Alan Yang, would later create Loot, a comedy series in which Rudolph plays a woman who divorces her billionaire husband, walks away with half of his money and then struggles to figure out how to coexist with regular people, including those who work at the philanthropic foundation that she didn’t even realize she had. “It just felt very much of the time, and it felt interesting to enter the conversation about philanthropy and wealth and social responsibility,” says the actress, who is also an EP of the show through Banana Split Productions, which she runs with Danielle Renfrew Behrens, a friend since kindergarten. Fun fact: Rudolph’s comedy actress Emmy nom for her performance in the show’s second season marks her first-ever performance recognition outside of the categories for comedy guest acting (which she won in 2020 and 2021 for work on SNL) and voiceover acting (which she won in 2020, 2021 and 2023 for work on Big Mouth). Prior to Loot, though, Rudolph, who is biracial, found that many in the industry weren’t quite sure what to do with her. For that reason, she found nothing more freeing than writing characters for herself at the Groundlings or SNL (“People were not planning on writing me as a lot of things, so I had to tell people how they need to look at me”) and voicing animated characters like Connie The Hormone Monstress on Big Mouth (“You can be anything, which, for me, is a dream”). Finally, it seems, the times are catching up to Maya Rudolph.","summary":"&#8220;I have to tell you, it has been an experience,&#8221; says Maya Rudolph&#160;upon being asked about the mounting calls from the public, since Joe Biden’s July 21 announcement that he will not be seeking reelection, for her to reprise her Saturday Night Live impersonation of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, who she previously portrayed [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/maya-rudolph-reprising-kamala-oscars-emmy-noms-awards-chatter-live-1235978349/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/NEW-Maya-Rudolph-Awards-Chatter-Split-H-2024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:13:34","author":"Scott Feinberg","authors":["Scott Feinberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":254469362,"title":"Iran to blame for hacks targeting Trump, Biden-Harris campaigns: US intelligence officials","text":"US intelligence officials said on Monday they were confident that Iran was responsible for the hack of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, casting the cyber intrusion as part of a brazen and broader effort by Tehran to interfere in American politics and undermine faith in democratic institutions. Although the Trump campaign and private-sector cybersecurity investigators had previously said Iran was behind the hacking attempts, it was the first time the US government had assigned blame for the attack. The joint statement from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other federal agencies also indicated that Iran was responsible for attempts to hack Vice-President Kamala Harris’ campaign, saying hackers had “sought access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaign of both political parties”. The goal of the hacking and other activities, federal officials said, was not only to sow discord but also to shape the outcome of elections that Iran perceives to be “particularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests”. “We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting Presidential campaigns,” said the statement, which in addition to the FBI was also released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The statement largely confirms the findings of private companies such as Microsoft, which earlier this month issued a report detailing foreign agents’ attempts to interfere in this year’s election, and Google, which separately said that an Iranian group linked to the country’s Revolutionary Guard has tried to infiltrate the personal email accounts of roughly a dozen people linked to US President Joe Biden and Trump since May.","summary":"Trump campaign and private investigators said Iran was behind hacking attempts; it is first time US government has assigned blame for attack.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3275109/iran-blame-hacks-targeting-trump-biden-harris-campaigns-us-intelligence-officials","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/08/20/4432f7d6-2ca8-41da-bcac-0980c5b8d764_aa11ce31.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:13:25","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.231},{"id":254469602,"title":"U.S. confirms Trump campaign claim it was breached by Iranian hackers","text":"The U.S. government has formally endorsed former President Donald Trump’s claim that Iran hacked his campaign.

Iran and Russia have employed these tactics not only in the United States during this and prior federal election cycles but also in other countries around the world.” The same hackers were alleged by Google to have targeted the Biden-Harris campaign before President Joe Biden ended his run for re-election, but it’s not clear whether they were breached. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ campaign previously said it had no indication it was hacked. The agencies said the FBI continues to investigate. “Protecting the integrity of our elections from foreign influence or interference is our priority,” the agencies said. “As the lead for threat response, the FBI has been tracking this activity, has been in contact with the victims, and will continue to investigate and gather information in order to pursue and disrupt the threat actors responsible. We will not tolerate foreign efforts to influence or interfere with our elections, including the targeting of American political campaigns.” Iran’s mission to the United Nations didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Iranian state news has previously reported that a representative for the mission had denied the country was involved in trying to hack Trump’s campaign. “Iran has furthermore demonstrated a longstanding interest in exploiting societal tensions through various means, including through the use of cyber operations to attempt to gain access to sensitive information related to U.S. elections,” the statement said. Three American news outlets — Politico, The New York Times and The Washington Post — said this month they had received documents that appeared to have been stolen from the Trump campaign. A spokesperson for the campaign claimed the documents were part of an Iranian “hack-and-leak” operation to hurt Trump’s election chances.

The “warnings signs” are evident, Fred Trump III said during an interview on The Dean Obeidallah show on Friday, accusing the former president of spewing “craziness” and failing to stick to the script during campaign appearances. “I know what I saw in my grandfather. I know what I saw in Donald’s older sister, my Aunt Maryanne,” Fred Trump said. “I just, I know the warning signs from both of my grandfathers,” he added. “Donald’s cousin, John Walters had dementia. It runs in the family. I’m not happy about it.” The Independent has contacted the Trump campaign for comment. Fred Trump III is the brother of psychologist and author Mary Trump, and the eldest son of Donald Trump’s late older brother, Fred Trump Jr. He has emerged as another vocal critic of the former president from within his own family. In July, Fred Trump III endorsed his uncle’s rival for the White House, Kamala Harris. And in a memoir which came out the same month, All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way, the former president’s nephew accused Trump of musing aloud about whether people with disabilities would be better off dead instead of causing expenses for their caregivers. The comment came as a shock, Fred Trump writes, because his own son William was diagnosed as an infant with a rare seizure disorder that has caused significant cognitive and physical damage. Donald Trump has said that he supported Fred Trump III, contributed to a fund to support William, and introduced the family to officials from the National Institutes of Health who might offer assistance. “I helped him so much, more than anyone else in his life, and this is the thanks I get. I even set up [a] meeting with NIH and top doctors in the country talking about his son, who is disabled,” Donald Trump said in a statement to The Washington Post, accusing fellow family critic Mary Trump of convincing Fred to write his book. The issue of age and mental ability has been central during the 2024 presidential race as numerous Democrats questioned whether Joe Biden had the mental fitness to win before he stepped down from his reelection campaign.","summary":"Fred Trump has endorsed Kamala Harris for president","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-nephew-fred-dementia-family-b2598666.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/17/03/TRUMP-PATRIMONIO_38062.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/tABNqjZF-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:10:32","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.237},{"id":254469128,"title":"Former MAGA Republican Rich Logis Slated to Speak at DNC","text":"Rich Logis voted for former President Donald Trump four times: twice in the primaries and twice in the general elections of 2016 and 2020.\"I was wrong about all of it,\" Logis said in a op-ed for Newsweek last year.

The FBI on Aug. 12 had announced that it was investigating reports that hackers potentially linked with Iran had targeted the Trump campaign. According to the statement, Iranian hackers appear to have attempted to hack both Trump’s campaign and the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris. The agencies placed the attempted hack into the context of “increasingly aggressive Iranian activity” during the current election cycle, saying, “this approach [by Iran] is not new.” The Office of the Director of National Intelligence released an intelligence community assessment last month, concluding that Iranian groups are working to fuel distrust toward U.S. institutions and increase social discord. The assessment states that Iranian groups use “vast webs of online personas and propaganda mills to spread disinformation and have notably been active in exacerbating tensions over the Israel–Gaza conflict.” The intelligence community report further states that Tehran is “working to influence the presidential election, probably because Iranian leaders want to avoid an outcome they perceive would increase tensions with the United States.” The Iranian mission to the United Nations has denied allegations of Tehran’s involvement in a cyber breach targeting the Trump campaign. The Iranian mission insists that Tehran is instead the target of cyberattacks. The mission said Tehran uses its cyber capabilities for defense and for directing proportionate responses to the attacks that Iran faces. In the Aug. 19 statement, intelligence officials vowed continued vigilance in identifying and countering such threats. “Protecting the integrity of our elections from foreign influence or interference is our priority,” the statement said. That report found that an Iranian group connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, called “Mint Sandstorm,” sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign from a compromised email account belonging to a former senior campaign adviser. The MTAC report stated that the same group was also responsible for an attempted hack during the 2020 election, including a failed effort to breach the account of an unidentified former presidential candidate. In the wake of the report, Trump’s 2024 campaign team acknowledged its validity, saying that they had been hacked and had campaign documents stolen. They included a 271-page research dossier drafted while Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) was still being vetted for the No. 2 job as well as similar, albeit incomplete, materials related to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), another finalist for the job. The campaign breach comes in the wake of reports that, ahead of the failed July 13 attempt on Trump’s life, Iran had independently hatched a plot to assassinate the former president.","summary":"The FBI previously said it was investigating reports that hackers potentially linked with Iran had targeted the former president's campaign.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/iran-behind-hack-targeting-trump-campaign-us-intelligence-agencies-5708488","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/13/id5704790-GettyImages-1242409189-1-LSedit-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:05:01","author":"Joseph Lord","authors":["Joseph Lord"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.397},{"id":254469402,"title":"Democratic Convention protesters to Harris: Israel arms embargo or no vote","text":"Chicago, Illinois – Rich Barnes says that opposing Israel’s war in Gaza is not a complicated issue. “Are we for mass murdering babies, or are we against it? To me, it’s a pretty simple equation,” he said, holding Palestinian and Irish flags near the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago on Monday. Barnes was one of thousands of protesters who blanketed the grass of Union Park, blocks away from the Democratic National Convention, to demand an end to United States support for Israel’s war. As the Democrats gathered at the convention to present Vice President Kamala Harris as their presidential nominee, several Palestinian rights advocates told Al Jazeera that they will not vote for Harris unless she agrees to an arms embargo against Israel. The demonstration, dubbed a “March on the DNC”, also demanded an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. “I’m worried because I feel like there’s not going to be any big, major change with her,” Barnes said. “We’re trying to put as much pressure on from the left to say: ‘Listen, you can’t expect our vote.” The protesters held signs linking Harris and President Joe Biden to the atrocities in Gaza, which they describe as a genocide – an effort to destroy the Palestinian people through bombing and starvation. “Both Democrats & Republicans have blood on their hands,” one poster read. Another one said: “No votes 4 Kamala until arms embargo 4 Israel.” ‘We need to see action’ The convention kicked off on Monday as thousands of Democratic officials, operatives and supporters descended on Chicago to celebrate Harris’s candidacy ahead of the presidential election in November. Harris, who was selected to replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket, is set to accept the party’s nomination on Thursday, the fourth day of the event. But the convention protests had been organised with the assumption that Biden – a staunch Israel advocate who led support for the war on Gaza – would be the nominee. He withdrew from the race on July 21 amid concerns about his age and ability to lead. For many protesters, however, the new Democratic nominee makes little difference. Their message to the Democratic Party remains the same: It must listen to the millions of voters who want to end US-backed human rights abuses against Palestinians. While Harris has acknowledged Palestinian suffering in Gaza, the Democratic nominee has not promised any actual policy changes on the issue. Amal Jaber, a teacher who drove from Wisconsin to join Monday’s protest, dismissed Harris’s professed empathy for Palestinians as “lip service”. “We need to see action,” Jaber told Al Jazeera. “Palestinians are still being killed today. Unless we see real change, I don’t see the Muslim community in Wisconsin supporting Kamala Harris right now. Enough is enough.” The US has provided Israel with military support and billions of dollars in aid to back the war on Gaza, which has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians. Biden, a self-proclaimed Zionist, has been an unflinching supporter of Israel. Vice presidents usually do not dictate foreign policy, but the White House has said that Harris has been a “full partner” in overseeing the US approach to Gaza. But last month, after meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Harris called the war “devastating”. “We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent,” she told the press. Still, the vice president has said through her aides that she does not support an arms embargo against Israel, disappointing the hopes of many antiwar demonstrators. At the protest in Chicago on Thursday, one protester held a sign that said, “DNC = Decades No Change.” “There’s been no change. There’s no reform by the murderous system. And the answer is to abandon the empire,” Tina, who chose to be identified by her first name only, told Al Jazeera. She added that Harris’s expression of sympathy for Palestinians does not make any difference without a change in policy – “none whatsoever”. ‘This isn’t going away’ Gaza-related protests are expected to continue throughout the week until the convention concludes on Thursday. Chicago, which has a long history of political activism, is home to one of the largest Palestinian communities in the US. A masked protester who chose to remain anonymous told Al Jazeera they found it incongruous that the Democrats decided to hold their convention in Chicago, the largest US city to pass a Gaza ceasefire resolution. “It feels like a slap in the face that the Democrats are currently funding this genocide, yet they chose to come here,” the demonstrator told Al Jazeera. “But it also feels right that we’re doing this rally here and we have the opportunity to show up.” Inside the halls of the Democratic National Convention, the antiwar movement will also be represented by the dozens of “uncommitted” delegates. They represent the hundreds of thousands of people who voted “uncommitted” in the Democratic primaries to protest Biden’s Gaza policy. “We need a change in the Gaza policy. We need a ceasefire,” Abbas Alawieh, an “uncommitted” delegate from Michigan, told reporters at a news conference early on Monday. “We need to stop sending weapons that are being used to kill families, to kill people we love, to kill civilians in Gaza and to perpetuate a crushing occupation of Palestinian lands and of the Palestinian people.” Back at the protest, demonstrators cautioned Harris that they – and their demands – will not be easily dismissed. “This isn’t going away,” said Kwabena Ampofo, a US military veteran. “What you see right now isn’t just a media moment. This isn’t just five minutes or 15 minutes of sun. This is an issue that – I’ve never seen in my almost 30 years of life – transcends so many people’s lives.”","summary":"Thousands gather at the Chicago convention to call for a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to US weapons transfers to Israel.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/19/democratic-convention-protesters-to-harris-israel-arms-embargo-or-no-vote?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-19T211817Z_1765742657_RC29J9ACN4TM_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-DEMOCRATS-1724105858.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:03:57","author":"Ali Harb,Apps Support","authors":["Ali Harb","Apps Support"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":254468978,"title":"Battenfeld: Hypocrites’ night at the Democratic National Convention","text":"DNC leaders put Biden and other unwelcome guests like Jill Biden and Hillary Clinton on the first, low visibility night of the love fest to get them out of the way and put as much distance as possible between them and Kamala Harris’s coronation.","summary":"DNC leaders put Biden and other unwelcome guests like Jill Biden and Hillary Clinton on the first, low visibility night of the love fest to get them out of the way and put as much distance as possible between them and Kamala Harris’s coronation.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/08/19/battenfeld-hypocrites-night-at-the-democratic-national-convention/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24232644633505.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:02:44","author":"Joe Battenfeld","authors":["Joe Battenfeld"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.271},{"id":254470586,"title":"After being nudged aside, Biden will address fellow Democrats","text":"President Biden will deliver a speech he never intended Monday evening, addressing the Democratic National Convention as he attempts to pass the mantle to Vice President Kamala Harris while burnishing his own legacy as a rare one-term president who is not seeking reelection. The speech bookends one of the more unusual months in modern American politics as Biden, 81, was nudged aside by his own party four weeks ago over concerns he lacked the vigor to defeat former President Trump. Instead of speaking Thursday night, as the nominee, he will speak on the opening night, along with failed 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton, before heading off for vacation in Santa Barbara County. The party is now trying to celebrate him, while acknowledging that his exit has added excitement to a race that seemed headed toward failure just four weeks ago. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who helped orchestrate the effort to persuade Biden to drop out, called him \"selfless\" and \"one of the greatest, most consequential presidents in our country's history\" while speaking to reporters Monday at the California delegation breakfast. \"I just wanted to win this election,\" she said, when asked about her now-frayed relationship. Democrats are planning on welcoming Biden as a hero. But he remains unpopular with the nation at large, with approval from 38% of voters compared with 56% who disapprove of him, according to the Fivethirtyeight.com polling average. Biden is hoping those numbers will improve over the next several years, as they often do for former presidents, when they retreat from the daily news cycle. Since announcing his departure from the campaign, Biden has tried to boost Harris by pointing to his legacy projects, including trillions spent on infrastructure, the social safety net and environmental projects.","summary":"President Biden is speaking on opening night of the Democratic convention, along with failed 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton, before heading off for vacation in Santa Barbara County.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-08-19/2024-election-democratic-convention-biden","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aebfa19/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4579x2404+0+325/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2Ffa%2F28fa2e034c16809893673a6e8ac1%2F1472058-la-pol-dnc-r","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 23:01:46","author":"Noah Bierman,Seema Mehta","authors":["Noah Bierman","Seema Mehta"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":254469060,"title":"Letters: Trump and Fed | Complex issues | Diverse community | Hurting patients | Harris economy","text":"Beware of Trump plan to politicize the Fed The Federal Reserve is designed to be an independent, apolitical body with two mandates, maximum employment and price stability. Most Americans are completely unaware of the role the Fed plays in our economy and would be loath to explain the difference between monetary policy and fiscal policy. Should he prevail in the upcoming presidential election, former President Donald Trump messages he would like to exercise more control over the Federal Reserve Bank in setting interest rates. That being said, voters should be educated on the risks of politicizing the Fed. One need only look at the disastrous economic outcomes of Turkey and Venezuela as their authoritarian presidents either removed or browbeat the central bank’s leadership to lower interest rates. To have a president put his or her thumb on the scale in the decision-making would be a grave mistake. Grant Lindholm Palo Alto Housing crisis driven by complex issues Housing is complex. But here are two points to consider (which analysts rarely address). First, unregulated rent-seeking private hedge funds are driving up rents and control some of the supply of rental property. They artificially create scarcity. This should change. Second, property taxes change the entire ownership model. It’s not just about servicing a mortgage and maintaining a property, property tax can be the key deterrent to home ownership. We can only hope that our politicians and analysts start to get real about the true costs of both renting and home ownership. It’s the only way we can begin to solve the homeless problem.

It is wonderful that the new housing complex, Spartan Village on The Paseo, will be a vibrant living space for SJSU students and a source of pride for the entire community. We must not forget that this fine housing tower is on the former site of Market Street Chinatown, a vibrant immigrant community destroyed May 4, 1887, by a racist act of arson. A plaque in front of the hotel, once the Fairmont, tells the story of what happened here. The rest of the story can be found at Heinlenville Park a few miles away in Japantown.

Connie Young Yu Los Altos Hills Pharmacy benefits managers harm patients The FTC’s interim July report on Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBM) and their nefarious practices is sending shockwaves nationally, confirming patients’ access to affordable medications has been sacrificed through anti-competitive practices. What started off as middlemen negotiating drug prices has ballooned into a billion-dollar industry, with only six companies controlling nearly 95 percent of prescriptions filled in the US. According to the report, this power allows PBMs to charge whatever price they prefer, steer patients to go to their own parent company’s pharmacy and force mom-and-pop pharmacies to close. PBMs have gone unchecked for too long, primarily because our policymakers felt they didn’t have finite evidence exposing their unscrupulous practices. But now they have it. I am thrilled to see the FTC signaling a lawsuit against the top three PBMs for driving up insulin costs and overcharging for cancer drugs. PBMs are harming the very people they are supposed to protect.

Excessive government spending will cause more Biden-like inflation except much higher. Businesses will be forced to pass inflation on in the form of higher prices and the economy will slow, resulting in higher unemployment, lower wages and less economic growth.

Critics have blasted the policy and have said such measures could lead to shortages, black markets, and hoarding, reflecting past distortions seen when countries have attempted to control prices by decree. Dallas, a proponent of the \"small mom-and-pops\" against conglomerate takeover, questioned whether the issue of so-called \"price gouging\" is simply the difference between production costs and selling prices, or if it includes all the factors involved in getting the product to market. \"A tomato, for example, that's grown in southwest Michigan – a few years ago there was a certain wage and there were employees to be had in order to do that job in picking. Today, we have to pay twice or three times more in order to get the same product. So, how can we say or where do we say that there is price gouging or natural price increase? So, I'm confused as to what would constitute gouging,\" Dallas, who neither identified as a Republican or a Democrat, said. 'RUBBER-STAMPED': KEY DEM HIT OVER BIDEN-HARRIS SUPPORT ON BORDER, INFLATION \"Inflation always impacts, but politicians have a lot to do with inflation,\" he said, adding that former President Trump's policy proposal for across the board tariffs would also raise the cost of products abroad and make goods more expensive. \"I don't begrudge anybody for making a decent wage, but artificially increasing minimum wage increases everybody's wage,\" he said. \"So, when you have a product that's produced that it would take, for example, $3 labor costs to make it the next thing you know is that $3 becomes five or $6 per item that's going to be affected, whether it's food or whether it's clothing or whatever have you, the end price is going to increase.\" \"If something goes higher one end, it will affect something at a different end,\" he said. HARRIS DOES ABOUT-FACE ON SEVERAL FAR-LEFT POLICIES, DISTANCES HERSELF FROM BIDEN While Dallas said he's against price controls at the grocery store level, he added some level of price-control regulation may be necessary to prevent large grocery chains from stomping out small, independently-owned stores in rural areas. \"It's a battle that we fight every day,\" Dallas said of rising product costs. Harris' price gouging proposal would give authority to the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to impose harsh penalties on companies for setting excessively high prices. Republican economists have criticized the move, calling it \"Marxist\" and \"lunatic behavior.\" They also challenged the merits of Harris' claim that food and grocery providers are artificially inflating prices. \"Actual consumer prices have been going up less than producer prices, which means that businesses, if anything, are price gouging themselves,\" Richard Stern, director of the Heritage Foundation's Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, told Fox News Digital in a previous interview. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"If the prices are going up more than the cost of doing business, then [the consumer price index] would be going up faster than [the producer price index], and it's not.\" Harris' plan also includes efforts to remove tax benefits from Wall Street investors through a bill called the Stop Predatory Investing Act, aimed at curtailing predatory practices by major investors who acquire large numbers of single-family rental homes.

It was just the latest bizarre feature in an election that has already featured a debate collapse, an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, a high-powered pressure campaign, the stunning withdrawal of the candidate, and even the president losing a primary American Samoa. ‘We’re delivering on President Biden’s pledge to rebuild our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down,’ it says. It calls the election ‘a choice between two very different economic visions for America: Donald Trump, who sees the world from his country club at Mar-a-Lago; and Joe Biden, who sees it from kitchen tables in Scranton like the one he grew up around.’ Those were just a pair of the dozens of mentions of Biden, 81, who ended his campaign after a series of elected lawmakers and party officials urged him to end his run against Trump, 78. ‘In President Biden’s second term, he will continue selecting judges who will protect fundamental rights and who represent the diversity of the American experience. We will push for a Supreme Court that follows the rule of law, protects people’s freedoms, and abides by the highest ethical standards,’ says the platform in one section that is clearly out of date. It also mentions Donald Trump more than 100 times. It does mention Vice President Kamala Harris, who has unified the party around her after getting Biden’s endorsement. ‘President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats are running to finish the job. It got approved by the party’s Platform Committee July 16 less than a week before Biden stepped back, in a stunning illustration of the pace of the turnaround. Now, it will serve as a general governing blueprint for Harris, who has so far been dribbling out her own policy proposals and turning down interview requests. That includes her campaign calling for a top corporate tax rate of 28 percent – in line with President Biden’s budget blueprint for the 2025 fiscal year. Other economic proposals in the platform include a $15 federal minimum wage and a $10,000 tax credit for first time home buyers. High up in the platform is a statement about the Chicago land where the convention is being held. ‘While we meet in Chicago, we also recognize and honor the traditional homelands of the Anishinaabe, also known as the Council of the Three Fires: the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi Nations,’ it says. ‘We acknowledge the many other tribes who consider this area their traditional homeland, including the Myaamia, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Sac and Fox, Peoria, Kaskaskia, Wea, Kickapoo, and Mascouten.’ ‘Over the past two years, more than 20 states have imposed extreme and dangerous abortion bans – many of which include no exception even for rape or incest – that put the health and lives of women in jeopardy, force women to travel hundreds of miles for care, and threaten to criminalize doctors for providing the health care that their patients need and that they are trained to provide,’ goes a passage on abortion. One paragraph hammers Trump on denying the results of the 2020 election carried by Biden. It’s something Harris has not been stressing at her rallies to the extent Biden has. ‘Trump refuses to defend core tenets of our democracy: the Constitution, the rule of law, our system of checks and balances. He still doesn’t accept the plain truth, upheld by scores of courts, that he lost in 2020, even describing himself as a “very proud election denier” – and he has never agreed to accept this year’s results. After years undermining public faith and confidence in our elections, he has warned of a “bloodbath” if he loses now,’ says the platform. ‘He lionizes the convicted criminals who perpetrated the January 6 attack on our Capitol and brave police, calling those insurrectionists “patriots” and “hostages” while promising to pardon them.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe platform released by the Democratic Party Sunday talks up President Joe Biden’s&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Unveiling the 2024 Democratic Party Platform: Exploring the Extensive Priorities Including Numerous References to &#8216;Joe Biden&#8217;s Second Term&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/unveiling-the-2024-democratic-party-platform-exploring-the-extensive-priorities-including-numerous-references-to-joe-bidens-second-term/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/19/22/88698891-13759029-image-a-3_1724101242397.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-19 22:59:17","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":254468626,"title":"Iran is 'increasingly aggressive' in its operations to target US presidential campaigns: Intel community","text":"The intelligence community said it has observed \"increasingly aggressive Iranian activity\" during the 2024 election cycle, involving influence operations targeting the American public and presidential campaigns.

The FBI has been investigating Iranian cyber hacking attempts against Trump’s presidential campaign, after Politico began receiving internal Trump campaign documents. The Trump campaign said the documents were obtained \"illegally from sources hostile to the United States,\" who \"intended to interfere in the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process.\" Iranian hackers broke into the account of a \"high ranking official\" on Trump’s campaign in June 2024. The hack by Iran came \"after recent reports of an Iranian plot to assassinate President Trump around the same time as the Butler, PA tragedy.\" \"The Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House,\" Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. \"Any media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America’s enemies and doing exactly what they want.\" But the intelligence community said it is \"confident that the Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaigns of both political parties.\" \"Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the U.S. election process.

The 2024 presidential campaign for Vice President Kamala Harris told Fox News it \"vigilantly monitors and protects against cyber threats, and we are not aware of any security breaches of our systems.\" Iran has long been suspected of running hacking campaigns targeting its enemies in the Middle East and beyond. Tehran also has long threatened to retaliate against Trump over the 2020 drone strike he ordered that killed prominent Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani.

They were right","text":"PROGRAMMING ALERT: Watch host Laura Ingraham discuss this topic and much more on ‘The Ingraham Angle’ on Fox News Channel at 7 pm ET. Many of us remember the 1985 Chicago Bears – one of the most dominant football teams in history. The Bears were famous for their bone-crushing defense, which often knocked the other team's quarterback out of the game. That’s pretty much what President Trump and his campaign did to the Democrats earlier this year. Joe Biden, as the incumbent president, was the Great Hope of the Democratic Party. They relied on his experience. They defended his record. They covered up his decline. They told themselves over and over that he was the only person who had ever beaten Trump, and therefore, that he was the best man for the job. They blocked anyone who tried to have a real debate in the Democratic primaries. And then, after all that, President Trump effectively ended Joe Biden’s 52-year career in 90 minutes. Now Biden is on the sidelines, where he sits along with almost everyone else who has challenged President Trump. The Clinton family, the Bush family, the Cheney family, and now the Biden family – all of them were very powerful until they crossed paths with Trump. Now they’re all retired from politics – contrary to what the media predicted at the time. THREE KEY ISSUES WHERE KAMALA HARRIS HAS MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS With all their most talented players gone, the Democrats have been forced to turn to an unproven backup – the last person they ever wanted to see on the field. For years, the media has told us that she was terrible at politics – and the media is not wrong. Since being named as the Democratic Party’s nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris has only made three major decisions – and all three were disastrous: 1. Caving in to the antisemites in her party, she bypassed Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro – the obvious choice for V.P. – and gave the job to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a radical left-winger who is the dream candidate if you do opposition research for the GOP. Because of the many lies Walz has told – and because of his disastrous record in the state – the Harris campaign is afraid to let Walz do interviews. 2. Rejecting advice from Democrats on the Hill, Harris announced a radical economic agenda last week that has already been denounced by top economists and her supporters in the mainstream press. 3. In her speech rolling out her agenda, she effectively conceded that Bidenomics was a failure and that Americans were still being hurt by inflation. Not surprisingly, clips from the speech are more likely to turn up in Trump ads than in anything released by the Democrats. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION So, let us be clear: there’s a reason why the Democrats wanted to keep Harris on the bench. There’s a reason why she’s the backup and not the starter. Of course, like any well-coached team, the Democrats are doing everything they can to protect her. They don’t let her do interviews. They encourage her to stay on script. They have told her publicly that they don’t want her offering any more policy proposals. And this week in Chicago, they will do everything they can to distract the voters from her terrible record and poor political judgment. But her momentum is already stalling. Trump still leads on the top three issues that concern Americans most – inflation, the border, and the economy. He’s showing staying power in key swing states including in Pennsylvania. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Furthermore, ditching Biden means effectively losing the advantage of incumbency while still being on the hook for any further disasters that happen between now and November. If, back in January, you had told Republican leaders these facts – that Biden would have bombed so badly that Dems had to go with Harris to win the election – they would have felt very confident about their chances. And they should feel confident now.
