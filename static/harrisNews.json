I’ve already endorsed President Trump,” Bannon told NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo on Wednesday. \n\n“A man like this comes along once every century if we’re lucky. We’ve got him now. He’s on fire, and I’m a huge supporter. I want to see him again in 2028,” he added. \n\nAsked how Trump would bypass the constitutional ban on a third term, Bannon replied, “We’re working on it.”\n\n“I think we’ll have a couple of alternatives, let’s say that. We’ll see what the definition of term limit is,” the former Breitbart News chairman said. \n\n“We’ve had greater longshots than Trump 2028. We’ve got a lot of stuff we’re working on. We’re not prepared to talk about it publicly. \n\nWhen asked if he was implying a violent revolution or an insurrection, Bannon said, “No. We are big believers in democracy.” The strategist said that the Trump supporters intend to mobilize their voting base, including low-propensity and low-information voters. \n\nTrump has repeatedly joked about the possibility that he could serve more than two terms. In January, he told a crowd of supporters in Nevada, “It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve, not once but twice or three times or four times.”\n\nEarlier this year, Republican Congressman Andy Ogles proposed to amend the Constitution to allow presidents who did not serve two consecutive terms to serve three terms in total. “It is imperative that we provide President Trump with every resource necessary to correct the disastrous course set by the Biden administration,” Ogles said in January.\n\nTrump was first elected in 2016, defeating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He ran for reelection in 2020 but lost to former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump won his second term last year, defeating Biden’s hand-picked successor, Kamala Harris.The two-term restriction was included in the Constitution in response to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented four-term presidency. Before him, US presidents only served one or two terms.","summary":"US President Donald Trump will run for a third term in 2028, Steve Bannon has said \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/614516-banno-trump-third-term/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.03/article/67db62af85f54056e645be86.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-20 00:35:02","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.421},{"id":302020166,"title":"Criticism of Judge Ana Reyes for Controversial and Unprofessional Decision Regarding Transgender Military Members","text":"A D.C. judge is being accused of being one of many “activist judges” who is using her position to stymie President Donald Trump’s agenda after blocking his de facto ban on transgender people in the military.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ana C. Reyes, a Biden-appointee and the first openly lesbian federal judge in D.C., blocked the Trump administration’s transgender troops ban on Tuesday night, in part citing Hamilton, a Broadway musical beloved by liberals, to justify her decision.\n\n“The Court’s opinion is long, but its premise is simple. In the self-evident truth that ‘all people are created equal,’ all means all. Nothing more. And certainly nothing less,” the order reads, differing from the Declaration of Independence which reads, “all men are created equal.”\n\n“Women were ‘included in the sequel’ when passage of the Nineteenth Amendment granted them the right to vote in 1920. See Lin-Manuel Miranda, Hamilton: An American Musical (2016); compare U.S. Declaration of Independence (1776) with U.S. Const. amend. XIX (1920),” the citation reads. “That right is one of the many that thousands of transgender persons serve to protect.”\n\nCivil rights attorney Laura Powell pointed out in a post to X that Judge Reyes’ opinion “relies in part on her independent research into disorders of sexual development (DSD), which is not part of the record.”\n\n“Judges are not allowed to do this,” she contended.\n\n“Not surprisingly, her information is wrong. For example, she cites the erroneous figure that 1.7% of Americans are intersex,” she noted. “She also makes assertions about where people with DSDs would be housed, based on no evidence whatsoever. (She asked the DOJ attorney the answer to that question, and he said he did not know.) This case has nothing to do with people with DSDs, many of whom were banned from serving in the military for years after the ban on trans people was lifted, which was never challenged.”\n\nAttorney Mike Davis, who is also founder and president of the Article III Project (A3P), argued that judges like Reyes are “activist judges” who “now think they control military readiness.”\n\nPresident of Judicial Watch Tom Fitton called Reyes’ opinion “disturbing” and “full of transgender extremist political talking points.”\n\nHe added that Trump’s Department of Justice (DOJ) has already filed an ethics complaint against Judge Reyes over her handling of this litigation, including questioning the DOJ attorney about his religious views and what Jesus would think about certain policies.\n\nThe ethics complaint reads:\n\nAfter a long screed about how she believes President Trump has discriminated against individuals with gender dysphoria (including a claim that he was “literally erasing transgender people”), Judge Reyes describes receiving an email suggesting that she develop a relationship with Jesus. She then uses this aside as an excuse to randomly pivot to questioning the DOJ attorney about his religious views: “What do you think Jesus would say to telling a group of people that they are so worthless, so worthless that we’re not going to allow them into homeless shelters? Do you think Jesus would be, ‘Sounds right to me’? Or do you think Jesus would say, ‘WTF? Of course, let them in?’”This line of questioning is deeply problematic for several reasons. First, the question has no relevance to the legal analysis of military policy. Second, it placed DOJ counsel in an untenable position of either appearing unresponsive or speculating about how an incoherent hypothetical aligns with Judge Reyes’ personal religious beliefs. Counsel, however, did not fall into that trap, but instead provided a professional response that highlights the impropriety of the question itself: “The United States is not going to speculate about what Jesus would have to say about anything.” Third, sporadic use of the inappropriate abbreviation “WTF” during the questioning of an attorney on his religious beliefs sheds light on the severity of the judge’s lack of professional decorum.\n\nDuring the hearing for the case in February, Reyes also denied the biological reality that there are two sexes.\n\n“This executive order is premised on an assertion that’s not biologically correct,” Reyes said, referring to the Trump administration’s position that there are only two sexes.\n\n“There are anywhere near 30 intersex examples. Anyone who doesn’t have XX or XY chromosomes is not just male or female, they’re intersex.”\n\nReyes, who was confirmed in 2023, has an extensive history of left-wing activism and donations to Democrats, Fox News reported. In her Senate questionnaire during her confirmation process, she said she volunteered for Biden’s 2020 campaign “providing limited legal assistance regarding potential election law issues.”\n\nFEC records show she has been donated more than $38,000 to Democrat causes since 2008, including to ActBlue, Democrat Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) campaign, and maxed out contributions to Biden’s 2020 run, according to the report:\n\nAdditionally, Reyes has been a frequent contributor to Defeat By Tweet, a Democratic-aligned super PAC that supports the Justice Fund, which Influence Watch describes as a group that “raises money for liberal groups in swing states each time President Donald Trump makes a post to his controversial Twitter account.”Defeat By Tweet’s website is currently shuttered but says it is “transferring” its resources to Black Church PAC, a group aligned with defunding the police that received at least $150,000 from the Kamala Harris presidential campaign.\n\nIn her Senate questionnaire, Reyes also acknowledged working for the Feminist Majority Foundation from 2014 to present, although she is not presently on the organization’s website, the report continues. The organization has previously called abortion a “necessity” and opposed the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, which bars males from female sports teams.\n\nReyes, who moved from Uruguay to the United States when she was a child, represented illegal immigrants while practicing as a lawyer, the report states. During a speech in 2017 accepting the Woman’s Bar Association of the District of Columbia’s Woman Lawyer of the Year award, she said she was “privileged” to represent asylum seekers and said it was an honor “fighting for the rights of refugees in the United States.”\n\nHer senate questionnaire further shows that she was a panelist in 2021 for a discussion called, “Did You Really Just Say That? Recognizing and Managing Microaggressions.” The discussion was hosted by Centerforce, a pro-DEI organization, according to the report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA D.C. judge is being accused of being one of many “activist&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Criticism of Judge Ana Reyes for Controversial and Unprofessional Decision Regarding Transgender Military Members first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/criticism-of-judge-ana-reyes-for-controversial-and-unprofessional-decision-regarding-transgender-military-members/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 23:52:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":302015546,"title":"Democrats’ silence is damning as leftist violence explodes","text":"Another Donald Trump presidential term, another spate of violence going largely ignored — or even smirked at — by Democrats and their media friends.\n\nTesla dealerships are being firebombed and shot at, while Tesla vehicles are vandalized and their owners assaulted.\n\nTrump-supporting influencers are getting “swatted,” set up for dangerous police encounters by opponents who phone in hoax distress calls.\n\nRelatives of Trump-aligned public figures — including the sister of US Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett and Elon Musk’s brother — are receiving bomb threats.\n\nThis cannot go on.\n\nThe multiple attacks on Teslas aren’t mere vandalism. This is terrorism exactly as the dictionary describes it: “The unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.”\n\nThese “vandals” are terrorizing Tesla the company, as well as Tesla owners — going so far as to dox them with an online map — all because they don’t like the opinions of its CEO.\n\nIt’s calculated to scare, to terrorize, people away from driving Teslas in order to apply political pressure on Musk.\n\nIt’s “nothing short of domestic terrorism,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said Tuesday.\n\nThe Justice Department has already charged several perpetrators, she said, in cases that could carry five-year mandatory minimum sentences.\n\nFive years is a good start — but it’s not enough. This kind of antisocial political barbarity is utterly unacceptable in a free country.\n\nThreats of violence cannot be allowed to curtail our freedom of speech.\n\nNor should the extended families of public figures face threats to their lives and safety. The siblings of a Supreme Court justice or the head of DOGE did not choose a public life, and bullying them is disgusting.\n\nSwatting, too is on the rise, with more than a dozen incidents aimed at right-leaning media figures reported in just the last 10 days.\n\n“This isn’t about politics,” FBI Director Kash Patel said Friday on X. “Weaponizing law enforcement against ANY American is not only morally reprehensible but also endangers lives, including those of our officers.”\n\nSwatting isn’t just a scary inconvenience; it has had deadly consequences. Police killed a Kansas man in 2017 after someone called in a fake hostage situation at his address. The “swatter” was sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nBut every swatting has the potential to turn deadly — in fact that’s largely the point. Just because swatters use technology, and law enforcement’s guns, shouldn’t give them a pass on the attempted murder of their political foes.\n\nMeanwhile, there is no federal anti-swatting law, making it harder to prosecute.\n\nRepublicans in Congress must take action. They can re-introduce the Anti-Swatting Act, a 2015 bill that was sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans, but never got a floor vote. \n\nCan Democrats really oppose using our law enforcement to target political enemies?\n\nWorst of all, much of this violence and abuse is being laughed off by people who would be weeping if the targets were their own political allies.\n\nJimmy Kimmel, ostensibly a late-night comedian but in truth more like an angry crank, sarcastically told his audience Tuesday, “Please don’t ever vandalize Tesla vehicles” — while looking mockingly into the camera, after a long pause, to let them know he meant the opposite.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, last seen as the great male hope of the failed Kamala Harris presidential campaign, told a crowd this week he keeps a finance app on his phone to follow Tesla and to “give me a little boost” whenever the stock declines.\n\n“Two-twenty-five and dropping!” he exulted.\n\nSuch jeers, as well as the deafening silence from most other Democrats, are simply intolerable.\n\nIf progressive influencers and leftist leaders were on the receiving end of such horrid tactics, every Republican in the country would be made to answer for it. “This is not who we are,” right-wing media would proclaim.\n\nAnd rightly so. But no such calls are coming from the Democrats and their media allies.\n\nDonald Trump ran on a platform of law and order. The increasingly rabid reaction to his presidency calls for a serious response.\n\nFor the last five years, the violent left has run rampant with few consequences for the chaos they have sown.\n\nRepublicans in Congress, and the Trump Justice Department, should show them that ends now.\n\nKarol Markowicz is co-author of the book “Stolen Youth.”","summary":"Attacks on Tesla and other violent threats are \"nothing short of domestic terrorism,\" said AG Pam Bondi — but Democrats are either smirking or silently approving.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/19/opinion/democrats-silence-is-damning-as-leftist-violence-explodes/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/newspress-collage-x9gfbgnu4-1742425756167.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1742411466&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 23:33:37","author":"Karol Markowicz","authors":["Karol Markowicz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.455},{"id":302013476,"title":"James Carville Rips Kamala Harris and Her Failed Campaign Despite Having 'More Money' — As She Quickly Loses Control of Democratic Party Following Defeat","text":"Add James Carville to the list of those in the Democratic party who have seemingly turned their backs on their once-promising candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nHarris has completely stayed out of the spotlight following her humiliating defeat to Donald Trump in November, with many claiming she's not the top dog anymore, RadarOnline.com can reveal.In an interview with Fox News Digital, Carville expressed he made a dire mistake when previously boasting Harris would take the election.\n\n\"The polls looked even, alright? I thought that Harris had more money. She also had more storefront locations, she had more doorknockers, definitely had better surrogates with two ex-presidents out there,\" he said. \n\nThe 80-year-old continued: \"Trump was going around with (actor) Scott Baio or something…. And I thought a combination of all of that would be worth a point and a half. It was not.\"The Democratic strategist also admitted Harris, 60, didn't exactly give people a reason to rush to the voting booth.\n\nHe said: \"You relearn the oldest lesson in politics. The greatest motivator of turnout, of voting, of persuasion is a reason. If you don't have a reason, you can't (win).\n\n\"People had a reason to vote for Trump. The one reason that they were looking for, I should have taken this into more account, was people wanted some change.\"Carville refused to confirm if he would like to see Harris give the presidency another shot, instead skirting around the question: “If she runs for president again, she’s got to be a lot better candidate than she was in 2024. Maybe she is.”\n\nHe continued: \"Look, she’s a former vice president. She’s a former prosecutor in a big city, apparently very good at it. She’s a former state attorney general. \n\n\"... She certainly passes anything you say about who could run for president. She would have to think about it, but it would be very, very difficult for her to win the nomination, but it would be difficult for anybody else.\"All this comes as Harris is not looked at as the leading candidate to right the ship for Democrats when the 2028 presidential election kicks off, especially as she has not made any statement amid Trump's controversial run so far. \n\n\"I think she's done at the top of the ticket, I think the country will not have moved in a progressive direction during that time, it will have become more conservative,\" a top donor said.\n\nDemocratic fundraiser Michael Kempner also added: \"I don't know if I would get involved at this point even if God were running. ...

I haven’t done anything that wasn’t allowed within the parameters we set. What and why are you screenshotting.”\n\nAnother woman, Sara, who describes herself as a domestic abuse survivor, claimed Sisson led her on, and said she sent him many “explicit” pictures because she believed he was “a person who genuinely cared for women more than for just their bodies,” in her own TikTok video.\n\nAnother woman, Hannah, who said she has known Sisson since she was 18 described him as a “sick” and “perverted” individual, claimed he was “the same f–king guy that’s gonna end up in the f–king political hierarchy that has all of these allegations but has too much power within to ever be taken down.”\n\nThe fallout left many online divided, with some calling his action “predatory” and “gross,” while others said the whole story was a tempest in a teacup.\n\n“Ladies, male feminists are predators.

But her baby was dark-skinned. “He was beautiful and perfect, but it was also very clear that something was wrong,” she said. “I hoped that it was just a sperm mix up.” The IVF process had been grueling. Murray, now 38, had endured multiple daily injections, frequent blood draws, bouts of nausea and exhaustion, a first embryo transfer that didn’t take, and, finally, pregnancy and labor. Then a DNA test revealed that the Georgia fertility clinic Murray had used had implanted a different couple’s embryo in her uterus. After raising the baby for five months, Murray, heartbroken, handed him over to his biological parents. “We all met in court, and the decision was made,” she said. “I walked in a mom with a child and a baby who loved me and was mine and was attached to me, and I walked out of the building with an empty stroller. And they left with my son.” She sued the clinic last month. Although cases like Murray’s are thought to be rare, an NBC News analysis of federal and state legal databases found more than 300 lawsuits filed from 2019 to 2024 alleging that embryos, eggs or sperm had been lost, destroyed or swapped. The suits were filed against fertility clinics or companies involved in the IVF process across 19 states, and the majority — at least 260 — involved allegations of product or equipment failures. Some legal experts say the cases are, in part, a product of the industry’s rapid growth. The number of babies born via assisted reproductive technology — which includes IVF — more than quadrupled from 1996 to 2022. The number of fertility procedures increased more than six-fold. Market researchers estimated the U.S. fertility industry was worth $5.7 billion last year. For more on this story, watch “NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt” tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT. IVF isn’t governed by the same regulations that hold other medical practitioners accountable for mistakes or safety violations, three legal experts said. For example, although more than half of U.S. states require hospitals to report serious, avoidable medical errors to regulators, those requirements don’t apply to IVF clinics. And embryology labs aren’t subject to federal inspections the way, say, blood banks are — instead, most are inspected by accreditation organizations. What’s more, there is no established legal claim pertaining to lost or swapped embryos like there is for medical malpractice cases involving errors by health care providers. So, IVF patients often have a hard time seeking redress after something goes wrong. Few of the lawsuits in NBC News’ analysis have gone to trial — and of those that have been resolved, most were settled or dismissed. Adam Wolf, an attorney representing Murray, said he expects to see more cases like hers because, in his view, the U.S. lacks sufficient state and federal regulations governing fertility clinics and labs. “Until IVF clinics are subject to real regulations, reporting requirements and mandatory certification programs for lab staff, these types of errors will continue to occur,” he said at a news conference last month. Wolf is part of a growing chorus of former IVF patients, lawyers, bioethicists and even some anti-abortion advocates calling for increased regulation of IVF. As demand rises, some say, the industry needs more oversight in order to keep pace. “Maybe if enough of us speak out, there will be more regulation, there will be more protocol put into place,” said Marissa Calhoun, 36, who sued her Los Angeles fertility clinic in the fall, alleging that the embryos she and her partner intended to use to start a family had been discarded by mistake. “That’s my only hope.” How common are IVF errors? It’s a mystery Calhoun was diagnosed with severe endometriosis in her teens — a condition that can make it difficult to get pregnant. By age 35, she had completed three painful egg retrievals. She and her partner, Stephen Castaneda, were elated in late 2023 when they found out that 16 of Calhoun’s eggs had been successfully fertilized. But days later, Calhoun’s doctor called: “He told me that all of my embryos had been discarded. He described it as an error in their lab,” she said. “I could barely speak. The weight of my medical condition, the weight of the years I spent collecting those eggs … I can’t describe the rush of thoughts and the rush of emotions that overtook me. I was just inconsolable.” Calhoun’s lawsuit alleges that a laboratory employee had failed to label her embryos before placing them in an incubator, then threw the unlabeled embryos away. The clinic, Reproductive Partners Medical Group, said it could not comment on an active lawsuit but denied the allegations in a court filing. A conference between the judge and the opposing parties is scheduled for later this month to determine next steps. NBC News’ analysis identified 82 lawsuits related to allegations of human error, like Calhoun’s, from 2019 to 2024, and 13 over swapped embryos, eggs or sperm. The cases involving equipment and product failures, meanwhile, included 176 related to a 2018 storage tank failure at a fertility clinic in San Francisco called Pacific Fertility Center, which led to the destruction of about 2,500 eggs and 1,500 embryos. The tank’s maker, Chart Industries Inc., denied an allegation made in a class action suit that the tank was defective. The clinic’s parent company, Prelude Fertility, denied allegations that it had been negligent. “Prelude and Pacific Fertility Center contend that the 2018 storage tank failure was caused by a defective tank,” said Alexandra Preece Barlow, an attorney who represented Prelude in the class action suit. Many of the cases against the clinic have gone to arbitration. However, in one that went to trial, a jury determined that Chart and Pacific Fertility Center had been negligent and awarded five former patients a total of $15 million. Chart appealed and reached a confidential settlement in that case and others. Chart, Prelude Fertility and Pacific Fertility Center did not respond to requests for comment. However, the clinic told NBC Bay Area shortly after the incident that it had brought in independent experts to investigate. “We are truly sorry this happened and for the anxiety that this will surely cause,” it said at the time. Another 50-plus lawsuits in NBC News’ analysis were related to claims that a liquid used to help fertilized eggs develop destroyed hundreds of embryos. The company that manufactured the solution, CooperSurgical, recalled several lots last year. CooperSurgical did not respond to requests for comment, but in a statement to NBC Connecticut last year, the company said it had initiated the recall proactively while investigating any potential issues. The company denied liability in response to one ongoing lawsuit in Ohio, and it has not yet responded to others filed in Connecticut, according to lawyers representing some of those plaintiffs. It’s impossible to know how often IVF-related accidents or mistakes really happen because clinics aren’t required to report them to federal or state agencies. No national database tracks the issues. Many IVF patients sign agreements to resolve disputes through a neutral third party rather than in court, said Tiseme Zegeye, who represents dozens of patients suing CooperSurgical. “We only hear about a small percentage of the disasters that happen in the fertility industry because so many patients sign arbitration agreements with their clinic,” she said. On the regulatory side, states generally don’t require a special license for IVF clinics to operate. (By contrast, the United Kingdom has a regulatory authority that licenses fertility clinics and approves the procedures they offer.) The Food and Drug Administration does, however, inspect facilities that store eggs and embryos and requires donor eggs and sperm to be tested for disease. IVF clinics are also required to report pregnancy success rates annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which publishes the data. Many fertility clinics and labs follow voluntary guidelines from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, a professional association of fertility doctors that outlines best practices. The guidelines include having a policy to disclose errors to patients. Contrary to the characterization offered by some legal experts, Sean Tipton, the society’s chief advocacy and policy officer, said that “fertility care is regulated essentially the same way as all medicine in the U.S.” and that lawsuits are “an important component” of that. The society declined to answer specific questions about fertility industry lawsuits. IVF errors fall into a legal gray area Murray surrendered custody of the baby she still considers her son in May, knowing she would likely lose a custody battle. Giving him up was perhaps the hardest thing she’s ever done, she said. “You’ve built your whole life around your son. You rearrange everything. Everything is about him. You spend every day for him, and then he’s not there,” Murray said. The clinic, Coastal Fertility Specialists, told NBC News that it “deeply regrets the distress caused by an unprecedented error that resulted in an embryo transfer mix-up.” It has not yet responded to the complaint. Dov Fox, director of the Center for Health Law Policy and Bioethics at the University of San Diego School of Law, said IVF lawsuits are challenging because courts tend to treat the errors as unfortunate accidents rather than violations of a provider’s duty to care for patients. “Courts have been reluctant to recognize reproductive interests as real or serious, and, in turn, we haven’t developed the kind of practice standards or expectations enforceable under the law in the way that we have in other areas of health care,” he said. By comparison, for medical errors like a sponge left inside a patient after a surgical procedure, patients often sue for medical malpractice. Fox said suits involving embryo loss have a harder time making that claim, since they rarely result in physical injuries. Instead, he added, they are typically filed as negligence or property damage cases, which often focus on financial harm and may underplay the emotional costs to couples. Courts also don’t look favorably upon claims that a clinic violated its contract with a patient, he said, since clinics don’t guarantee results. The IVF industry has historically opposed additional regulation, saying that mistakes are no more common than in any other field of medicine. “I think the industry as a whole is moving in the direction of safer practices — not that it was unsafe before, but just improving and getting better,” said Brent Barrett, chief laboratory director at Boston IVF, a network of more than 15 fertility centers across New England. Barrett said IVF clinics generally have strict protocols about where equipment is placed in labs and require more than one person to examine labels and dishes containing embryos. Many clinics have also adopted electronic tracking systems that assign barcodes to eggs, embryos and sperm. But those measures aren’t federally mandated. “Clinics could, if they want, use pencil and paper to label reproductive specimens,” Fox said. A fraught debate over embryos Reproductive rights advocates also have a reason to be wary of increased IVF regulations: They fear amplifying debates about whether embryos are considered babies under the law. That question was central to a wrongful death lawsuit filed last year against a fertility clinic in Alabama, after a person allegedly dropped several embryos on the floor. The Alabama Supreme Court ruled that embryos created through IVF were legally children. The verdict prompted multiple clinics to pause IVF services until state lawmakers passed a bill protecting providers that discard embryos. Discarding embryos because they have genetic abnormalities or patients no longer wish to use them is a routine part of the IVF process, though anti-abortion groups oppose the practice. “IVF is really mired in personhood and abortion debates in the United States in a way that just really complicates the discourse compared to places like the U.K.,” said Danielle Pacia, a research associate at The Hastings Center, a bioethics research institute in Garrison, New York. Zegeye, the lawyer, acknowledged that in pushing for IVF regulations, there’s a risk of extremes that prevent clinics from functioning — as happened in Alabama. “I do think that there’s a fine line and that we have to find a way to allow access to health care and still protect patients,” she said. The Alabama case, and its timing during an election year, thrust such conversations into the national spotlight. Republicans and Democrats each introduced IVF bills in the Senate last year: The Democratic bill proposed codifying access to IVF at the federal level, while the Republican bill would have denied Medicaid funds to states that prohibited IVF. Neither passed. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump both expressed support for IVF access during their campaigns, with Trump promising that either the government or insurance companies would cover the cost. Last month, President Trump issued an executive order seeking strategies to lower IVF costs, including by further reducing regulation. “It is the policy of my Administration to ensure reliable access to IVF treatment, including by easing unnecessary statutory or regulatory burdens to make IVF treatment drastically more affordable,” the order says. In the wake of the announcement, several anti-abortion groups called for more oversight of the industry. “America’s IVF industry is completely unregulated,” Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, an anti-abortion advocacy group, wrote on X. “Now that President Trump says he wants to fund more of it, shouldn’t a logical step for the Trump Administration be to regulate it, at a minimum?”","summary":"IVF isn’t governed by the same regulations that hold other medical practitioners accountable for errors or safety violations, several legal experts said.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/ivf-errors-legal-protections-nightmare-mistakes-lawsuits-rcna194215","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250313-ivf-lawsuits-ms-a22af4.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 21:01:06","author":"Alexandra Chaidez,Aria Bendix,Ellison Barber,Kenzi Abou-Sabe,Priya Sridhar","authors":["Alexandra Chaidez","Aria Bendix","Ellison Barber","Kenzi Abou-Sabe","Priya Sridhar"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.515},{"id":301965510,"title":"Sen.

Lisa Murkowski said her colleagues are afraid to speak up against some of the actions from President Donald Trump and key adviser Elon Musk because they think they will be \"taken down\" and \"primaried.\"\n\n\"You've got everyone zip-lipped. Not saying a word, because they're afraid they're going to be taken down, they're going to be primaried, they're going to be given names in the media,\" Murkowski, one of the few Republicans willing to publicly criticize some of the president's actions so far in his second term, said to reporters Tuesday in Alaska.\n\n\"You know what, we cannot be cowed into not speaking up.\"\n\nBoth Trump and Musk have threatened to primary dissenters in the party. Recently, Trump threatened to lead the charge against Republican Rep. Thomas Massie in the primaries, after the congressman said he would vote no on a Trump-backed continuing resolution to fund the government.\n\n\"It may be that Elon Musk decides that he's going to take the next billion dollars he makes off Starlink and put it directly against Lisa Murkowksi. And you know what. That may happen. But I'm not giving up one minute, one opportunity to try to stand up for Alaska,\" she said.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Murkowski addressed the Alaska Legislature, saying she was \"disturbed\" by how the Trump administration is treating federal employees as part of the Musk-led efforts to downsize the federal workforce.\n\n\"I think every single person in this chamber would agree that the federal government is too big,\" she said. \"I do support the mission behind DOGE. I get it. We need to find efficiencies in government.\"\n\nShe said that reduction in the workforce make \"absolute sense,\" but asked that it be done \"the right way.\" Murkowski said the administration's approach \"lacks the fundamental decency you need with real people.\"\n\n\"Public servants are not our enemies. They are our friends. they are our neighbors, they are integral to our economy and our ability to function as a state and a country, and their work might be underappreciated.\"\n\nShe also said the Trump administration was \"testing the court\" in ignoring a federal judge's order to halt two deportation flights of alleged gang members to El Salvador over the weekend.\n\n\"I don't think any one of us would disagree that when you've got members of a really awful gang who have done some awful things and who aren't in this country legally, we do not want them here,\" she said. \"But even when we want to get them out of our country there is a process, it's called due process. We follow our own rules here.\"\n\n\"When the court's orders are defied, that weakens our courts. When the people no longer believe that the system of justice is there for them, what do we have in this country?\"\n\nMurkowski also touched on foreign policy in her remarks, noting her home state's proximity to Russia and Canada.\n\nIn Trump's second term, he has imposed significant tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum and repeatedly expressed his desire to turn Canada into the 51st state. Trump's moves have led Canadian boycotts of United States' products as well as protests.\n\n\"How we came to a place where we're fighting now with Canada and we're making nice with Russia -- it's beyond me,\" Murkowski said.\n\nAfter the speech, Murkowski addressed criticism that she may not being doing enough to push back against the Trump administration and argued that she has to \"find places to work\" with the president, whom Alaskans voted for in November. The reliably-red state voted for Trump in the presidential election -- 54.5% to the 41% who voted for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nShe also said she won't back down on her convictions -- and said she will accept the consequences.\n\n\"I am not going to compromise my own integrity by hiding from my words when I feel they need to be spoken,\" she said. \"I'm going to take the criticism that comes.\"\n\n\"I get criticized for what I say, and then everyone else is like, 'Well how come nobody else is saying anything?' Well figure it out, because they're looking at how many things they are throwing at me and they're thinking 'Maybe I'll just duck and cover.'\"\n\nMurkowski, who voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial in 2021, also opposed the confirmation of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. But she voted to confirm Trump's other nominees, including Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

But the crowd still made their approval clear when he called Musk a “South African repo baby” with the ability to slash the federal government.\n\nWalz is just one of several Democrats who have referred to Musk’s immigrant background, just as Trump has made attacking immigrants a centerpiece of his agenda. Trump, however, has previously focused his ire on elected officials of color rather than the wealthiest individual in the world. \n\n“Which country is he loyal to? South Africa, Canada, or the United States?” Ohio Rep. Marcy Kaptur said during a press conference last month. Similarly, New York Rep. Nydia Velázquez said during a protest that Musk should “go back to South Africa.” At another protest, Virginia Rep. Don Beyer added, “We’re going to send Elon back to South Africa.”\n\nBorn in South Africa in 1971, Musk moved to Canada in 1989 and to the U.S. during his college years. He became a U.S. citizen in 2002, according to Walter Isaacson, his biographer. \n\nWalz was speaking during a town hall event on the first day of early voting for the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. The election, slated for April 1, is between a liberal and a rightwing Trump ally who has received $13 million from Musk. Democrats in the state have used the donations to attack Musk. \n\nWalz has called Musk a “nepo baby,” someone who inherits wealth or status, at least once previously. Musk’s father worked as an engineer and developer in Pretoria. \n\nWalz also appeared at a town hall event in Des Moines on Friday, where he slammed Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency for recommending cuts to the Veterans Affairs Department. \n\n“There’s nothing conservative about an unelected South African nepo baby firing people at the V.A.,” said Walz. \n\nTrump has often used the idea of his opponents being foreign as a means to insult them, beginning his political journey by questioning President Barack Obama’s place of birth. In his first term, Trump told a group of congresswomen of color, most of whom were born in the U.S., to “go back” to their home countries. Similarly, Trump questioned the ethnic background of Vice President Kamala Harris during the presidential campaign last year. He also frequently mispronounced her name. \n\nWhile many Democrats were furious at such attacks, some of them now seem to be attempting to make Musk seem like an outsider. During the 2024 election, The Washington Post reported that Musk had worked in the U.S. on a student visa in the 1990s, after which President Joe Biden referred to him as an “illegal worker.”\n\nMusk has denied working illegally in the U.S., and he has slammed illegal immigrants and suggested without evidence that Democrats are using benefits to draw them to the U.S. \n\nA White House chief strategist during Trump’s first term, Stephen Bannon, took aim at Musk last month, calling him a “parasitic illegal immigrant” who doesn’t have “respect for the country’s history, values or traditions.”","summary":"Walz is just one of several Democrats who have referred to Musk’s immigrant background","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/tim-walz-elon-musk-trump-b2718243.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/19/19/03/GettyImages-2203996979.jpg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/kKlQSSii-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-19 20:20:53","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":302017400,"title":"Donald Trump Claims He Won “Presidency THREE Times”, Slams Journalist for Not Knowing It!","text":"Recently, President Donald Trump caught people’s attention when he called out journalist Ashley Parker on his social media platform, Truth Social. He claimed she didn’t acknowledge that he’s “won the presidency three times.” What’s happening with Parker isn’t the first time Trump’s had a tiff with the media since he’s been back in office.\n\nTrump keeps saying he won the presidency thrice, but that’s not just factually wrong but also unconstitutional, as no US President can serve three terms in office. He won once in 2016 when he was up against Hillary Clinton and again in 2024 when he beat Kamala Harris. But in 2020, Trump didn’t win; Joe Biden did. Despite this, he also goes on and on about winning that year.\n\nIn his post, he said, “To this date, she doesn’t even know that I won the Presidency THREE times” and called Parker out, saying she can’t get the hang of “the intricacies of high-level politics.”\n\nAshley Parker is a highly regarded journalist who’s been doing great work with The Atlantic, and she’s got three Pulitzer Prizes to show for it. But when she asked to sit down for an interview with Trump, he basically told her to take a hike, calling her a “Radical Left Lunatic.” This shows how much Trump doesn’t like reporters who don’t just nod along with what he says.\n\nThe president’s words fit a bigger picture of being unfriendly to the news. Since he got back in charge, Trump has talked about taking some news places and writers to court for using people who don’t say their names. He’s even stopped some reporters from going to essential things at the White House and called big news channels like MSNBC and CNN names, saying they’re the “political arms of the Democrat Party”. This not-so-nice attitude is part of his plan to make people not trust the news and think about what he wants them to believe.\n\nTrump’s dealings with the media have always been pretty rocky. During his initial time in office, he had a knack for calling the press “fake news” and saying they were working against the American public. His latest spat with Parker reminds us of earlier tiffs, like when he accused The Atlantic of twisting his words about our troops during a trip to France in 2018.\n\nDespite his denials, even his former right-hand man, John Kelly, confirmed that he did say those controversial things in 2023.\n\nFormer President Trump’s former chief of staff, John Kelly, is speaking out about what he sees as the dangers of a second Trump term. @GarrettHaake reports on the details. pic.twitter.com/x1R2ygOPzP\n— TODAY (@TODAYshow) October 23, 2024\n\nTrump’s rhetoric here is really important. When he goes after certain reporters and news outlets, he tries to make people not trust stories that don’t agree with him. This way of doing things makes many folks worry about freedom of the press and how important it is for journalists to do their jobs where everyone can share their ideas without getting into trouble.\n\nPeople have had all sorts of reactions to what Trump has been saying lately. His fans think it’s okay for him to go after the media like that, but others are worried because they feel it could mess with the idea of a free press. The Atlantic, the magazine he talked about, hasn’t said much about it officially, but folks from other news places have said they will keep doing their job right.\n\nWhat Donald Trump’s been saying about Ashley Parker is just one piece of his bigger fight with the media. He keeps twisting things about his time running for office and putting down reporters, and that’s a big part of how free the press even is.","summary":"Donald Trump's latest attack on journalism underscores his ongoing battle with the truth.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trump-claims-he-won-presidency-three-times-slams-journalist-for-not-knowing-it","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/donald-trump-ashley-parker.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 20:02:29","author":"Sohini","authors":["Sohini"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":301994226,"title":"DAVID MARCUS: In deep blue Philly, the libs think we regret voting for Trump","text":"I met Greg, who is about my age, as we both had an early dinner in Center City, and while our conversation was calm and friendly, as a progressive Democrat, he is very literally scared and even angry about President Donald Trump in ways that seem to me wildly over the top. \"If I had to pull a gun on a Republican, that’s what I’d have to do,\" Greg told me. \"This is the greatest crossroads in our country since the Civil War.\" It didn’t feel particularly threatening. Even though he knew I am a Republican who voted for Trump, I figured he didn’t mean me. But he sure as hell meant something. Later in the day, in a drowsy West Philly of big houses which is so far to the left it makes Center City seem like Texas, I talked to three students. I was curious if they had experienced strained relations with friends or family over politics. \"Yes,\" one young woman told me, \"but not often, I think I’m a good judge of character.\" The clear message was that anyone who would vote for Trump is not somebody she or her friends want anything to do with. Our conversation was cut short after they told me Trump’s DEI cuts were a big issue for them, to which I asked, what do you mean by DEI? At that, they moved to another table. Once again, it wasn’t unpleasant, but it was pointed. Down the block, at a charming local bookstore, John, the owner, was kind enough to find me a book by Mary Beard I hadn't read, and to talk a little politics. \"It’s a lot of change all at once,\" he told me ominously, echoing something I hear from a lot of voters. One thing that almost all the Democrats I have spoken to in the City of Brotherly Love seem to believe is that there are large swaths of Trump voters out there in the hinterland who must certainly regret having voted for Trump. We saw this attitude on \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" over the weekend, when guest Batya Ungar-Sargon shocked him by saying not only does she not regret her vote for Trump, but that she is proud of it. I faced similar incredulity from Greg: This assumption, based on slim to no specifics, that Trump’s actions this time around have been so drastic, that surely we must understand what a profound mistake we made voting for him, even if we can’t say so in order to save face. FLASHBACK: PHILADELPHIA IS KAMALA HARRIS' ALAMO, AND THE NERVOUS DEMOCRATS HERE KNOW IT Or so they believe. Much of this comes down to bubbles, and no, it isn’t just progressives who live in them. In my little West Virginia town, it's perfectly normal to see MAGA hats in the Walmart, and few people seem to think Trump’s presidency is a crisis. So, to what, exactly, are people in Philly and other blue enclaves reacting so dramatically? One thing I sensed from everyone I spoke to was that this iteration of a Trump presidency seems entirely unrestrained to them. This time, there are no Republicans like John McCain to show Trump a thumbs down, no cabinet members urging restraint. This is Trump unleashed. It isn’t even about results, because in two months the results of Trump’s policies are not in yet. It is about the actions themselves. The firing of federal workers, the tariffs on our allies, a friendlier approach to Putin, deportations of illegal immigrants, even something as mundane as renaming a certain body of water \"The Gulf of America,\" feel like personal attacks to many Democrats. And there is nothing they can do to stop it. At least in the short term, there does not seem to be anything that can extinguish all the hair on fire on the progressive left. But, amid the overwhelming and unhinged reaction to Trump among Philly’s Democrats, I did meet one Republican, a tourist, who offered a bit of a warning sign for the Trump administration. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION \"I’m proud to be a Republican, and to have voted for Trump,\" he told me over a late-night cigarette outside our hotel, \"but these tariffs have me nervous.\" I pressed him on why and he said, \"I’m a salesman.

For some, that causes horror. For others, it is thrilling. But Democrats are much mistaken if they think Trump voters are expressing regret, even the ones who are a bit nervous.

The City of Philadelphia saw 78.57% of votes go to Kamala Harris this past election cycle, which was roughly a three-point decrease from Joe Biden's vote in 2020. Trump has been attending high-end sporting events ever since he took office, most notably Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans and the Dayton 500 on back-to-back Sundays last month. Trump became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl.

He gained Canadian citizenship just before his move and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002, as noted by his biographer, Walter Isaacson.\n\nWalz made these remarks at a town hall-style event coinciding with the commencement of early voting for a State Supreme Court race in Wisconsin. Scheduled for April 1, the election features a liberal candidate opposing a conservative ally of Trump, who has received over $13 million in support from Musk. Wisconsin Democrats have utilized these contributions to depict Musk as the primary antagonist in the election.\n\nThis marks at least the second occasion on which Walz has referred to Musk as a “nepo baby,” a colloquial term denoting someone who has inherited wealth or privilege (Musk’s father was a well-known engineer and developer in Pretoria). At a town hall in Des Moines on Friday, he criticized Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency for suggesting cuts to the Veterans Affairs Department.\n\n“There’s nothing conservative about an unelected South African nepo baby terminating employees at the V.A.,” he stated.\n\nTrump has a history of belittling his political opponents by implying they are foreign or distinct from typical Americans. He started his political journey in part by casting doubt on President Barack Obama’s citizenship. During his first term, he told a diverse, predominantly American-born group of congresswomen of color to “go back” to their home nations. While campaigning against Vice President Kamala Harris last summer, Trump often mispronounced her name and portrayed her as an outsider by questioning her ethnic heritage.","summary":"As he took the stage in downtown Eau Claire, Wisconsin, on Tuesday night to energize Democrats in light of a significant State Supreme Court election, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of name-calling.

After the loss, which included Walz getting steamrolled in the vice presidential debate by JD Vance, he has decided to reinvent himself as an obnoxious, toxic liberal who thinks that appealing to working-class men means forcing yourself to curse every other sentence and pretending that you want to fight people all the time.\n\nWALZ CELEBRATES TESLA’S STOCK DROPPING: ‘GIVES ME A LITTLE BOOST’\n\nAs unlikely as it may seem, Walz has an even better future in the Democratic Party after his loss than before.

He also has more institutional support with the Democratic National Committee, which named gun control activist David Hogg one of its three vice chairs. Hogg, who rose to prominence by standing on the bodies of his dead classmates and has since proven to have the intellectual capacity of a shoe, “bombarded” Harris aides with pro-Walz texts until Harris picked him as her running mate.\n\nWalz and his new obnoxious persona are not going anywhere any time soon because Democrats have whipped their base into a hateful frenzy that responds positively to these antics.

The electric vehicle giant has faced significant challenges, coinciding with Musk’s growing political alliance with President Donald Trump.\nTesla’s Declining Stock Price\nSpeaking at an event in Wisconsin on Tuesday night, Walz took a jab at Tesla’s declining stock price, admitting that he keeps an eye on it for personal amusement.\n“$225 and dropping,” Walz remarked, referencing Tesla’s closing price that day—a more than 50% drop from its December peak. However, contrary to his statement, Tesla shares rebounded the following morning, rising more than 3% to $233 at market open.\nMusk quickly responded to Walz’s comments, taking to his social media platform X to post a pointed retort.\n“Sometimes when I need a little boost, I look at the @JDVance portrait in the @WhiteHouse and thank the Lord 🙏,” Musk wrote, celebrating Trump and Vice President JD Vance’s election victory over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Walz.\nTim Walz Takes Further Dig\nWalz escalated the feud by suggesting that Tesla owners should consider removing the brand’s logo from their vehicles in response to Musk’s political leanings.\nTesla has led a rocky start to 2025 on Wall Street, with its stock down 44% year-to-date as of Tuesday. The decline places it at the very bottom of the S&P 500’s performance rankings. Despite surging nearly 90% in the weeks following Trump’s election win, Tesla shares have since fallen to a level about 7% lower than their Election Day price.\nWhile other major tech firms, including Apple and Google, have also struggled in the market, analysts attribute Tesla’s losses largely to Musk’s increasing political polarizations. Several Wall Street firms have downgraded Tesla’s sales forecasts, citing a downturn in regions where Musk’s outspoken right-wing views have sparked backlash. In Germany, for instance, Tesla’s February sales plummeted 76% year-over-year.\nTesla has also faced public protests, with showrooms across the U.S. becoming hotspots for demonstrations. In Las Vegas, multiple Tesla vehicles were set on fire, an incident Musk condemned as domestic terrorism.\n“Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks,” Musk wrote on X on Tuesday.\nMusk Vs. Tim Walz: A David vs. Goliath Political Battle\nReflecting on his public spat with Musk, Walz embraced the narrative of an underdog taking on one of the world’s wealthiest figures.\n“I think there’s something poetic about a schoolteacher being in this fight against the richest man in the world,” Walz, a former high school teacher, told The Minnesota Star Tribune on Tuesday.\nMusk’s fortune dwarfs Walz’s net worth by an extraordinary margin. According to Forbes, Musk’s net worth currently stands at $321.4 billion, largely due to his stakes in Tesla and his private aerospace company SpaceX. In contrast, Walz’s wealth is estimated to be just over $1 million—roughly 300,000 times less than Musk’s vast fortune.\nAlso Read: Why Did Trump Not Meet Sunita Williams And Butch Wilmore After Their Return From Space?

The number of falling states in the first year of the study was just nine. \n\nThe overturning of legislation also led to a surge in attacks on gender-affirming care for minors, the organization says.\n\nIn his first week, President Donald Trump signed a pair of executive orders to revive two anti-abortion policies from his first term in 2017, despite declaring that the issue should be left to individual states. \n\nAs things stand, abortion has been completely banned or almost completely banned in 19 states. \n\nConsequently, thousands of women across the country have had basic healthcare access refused, jeopardizing their future fertility and, in many cases, putting lives at risk.\n\nTrump’s latest threats to slash Medicaid funding have also mounted fresh fears on the future of abortion and reproductive rights in America. \n\n“Looming on the horizon is the possibility of a federal abortion ban or restrictions on mifepristone, which would be crippling to abortion access around the country,” the rePROs Fight Back report stated.\n\nAccording to the report, best practice medication and surgical care is banned in nearly half of U.S. states, but rePROs have warned that under the direction of Trump, state bans could soon extend to being enforced at a national level.\n\nFor the sixth year in a row, the U.S. as a whole received an “F” grade, meaning that safe reproductive healthcare remains at its lowest. \n\nIn the report, states are graded on three key factors: prevention, affordability, and access. \n\nStates are asked about sexual education in schools, if emergency rooms are dispensing emergency contraception, and if minors are allowed to consent to contraceptive services.\n\nThey are also posed with questions about the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, who qualifies for Medicaid family planning, postpartum coverage, insurance coverage for abortion services, and if there are harassing or burdensome requirements on those seeking family planning, abortion services, or gender-reaffirming services. \n\nStates that score highly will have comprehensive sex education in schools, emergency contraception mandated in the emergency room, access to contraception services for minors, Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, a Medicaid “waiver” expanding eligibility for family planning services, Medicaid postpartum coverage expanded to 12 months, insurance coverage of abortion services, an absence of abortion restrictions, an absence of TRAP laws (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers), access to abortion medication and access to gender-affirming care. \n\nThe highest for a state to score is between 86-100, an A, and the lowest is less than 49.9, an F. The more points a state is awarded, the better the services available. \n\nOnly five U.S. states were awarded an A in the report. In descending order, these were Oregon, Washington, California, New Mexico, and Vermont. \n\nThe 25 states that received a failed “F” grade were: \n\nJennie Wetter, Director of rePROs Fight Back, said that “the fight for bodily autonomy is far from over.” \n\nSpeaking on the political climate and how sexual health rights had worsened, Wetter said that states had been forced to resort to “enacting policies to protect abortion providers from investigations in hostile states,” which she called “true beacons of hope in this gathering storm.”\n\nHowever, she said that attacks on bodily autonomy were not slowing down anytime soon and insisted that hostility towards abortion and transgender rights is gaining momentum. \n\nShe said the threats presented by the Trump administration were “a menacing storm looming on the horizon.”\n\n“We are already failing when it comes to meeting people’s sexual and reproductive health needs by banning abortion, denying young people access to evidence-based sex education, blocking people from accessing affordable health care via Medicaid, putting gender-affirming care out of reach for many, and so much more,” Wetter said. \n\n“These impacts are never felt equally and disproportionately affect those who are already marginalized, such as BIPOC, people with low incomes, young people, those with disabilities, the LGBTQ+ community, and those at multiple intersections of these identities. \n\n“With the threats posed to our right to bodily autonomy by potential federal actions from the new administration related to abortion access, transgender health care, health care costs, and more, people in every state are at risk. We must be ready for a long, hard fight to achieve a world with reproductive freedom for all.”","summary":"‘The threat posed by the new administration is a menacing storm looming on the horizon’, director of rePROs Fight Back Jennie Wetter said","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/reproductive-rights-sexual-health-damning-report-b2717435.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/31/20/6a27fe8e9bd349f8b9a72d1a65d7cb81.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 17:01:17","author":"Madeline Sherratt","authors":["Madeline Sherratt"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":301962102,"title":"Dr. Varian D.

Emperor-core is going on at Mar-a-Lago. It’s frightening now. It’s like cyanide now.”\nThe slow celebrity exodus coincides with increased search interest around departing the US since last November. Below, here are some of the stars who have relocated amid Trump 2.0.\nRosie O’Donnell\nIn mid-March, the American actor and comedian revealed on TikTok that she moved to Ireland, and had no set plans to return to her homeland. “When it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America, that’s when we will consider coming back,” O’Donnell said. “It’s been heartbreaking to see what’s happening politically and hard for me personally as well. The personal is political, as we all know.”\nO’Donnell went on to share that she had relocated in mid-January with her youngest child, 12-year-old Dakota, whose nickname is Clay. “Although I was never someone who thought I would move to another country, that’s what I decided would be the best for myself and my 12-year-old child,” said the mother of five, whose four older children are now adults. “I’m happy. Clay is happy. I miss my other kids. I miss my friends. I miss many things about life there at home. I’m trying to find a home here in this beautiful country.”\nO’Donnell added that she is in the process of being granted Irish citizenship, which she is eligible for because her grandparents hail from the country. “Protect your sanity, is all I can say,” she concluded her nine-minute video. “Protect your sanity as much as you can, and try not to swim in the chaos if possible. But I know it’s nearly impossible when you’re there in the middle of it.”\nEllen DeGeneres\nDeGeneres and wife Portia de Rossi reportedly fled the UK after Trump won reelection, trading their Montecito house for a dwelling in the Cotswalds, a quaint region two hours from London. Sources told TMZ that while the couple had purchased their new home prior to Trump’s second electoral victory, they were “very disillusioned” when he won and wanted “to get the hell out.” DeGeneres, who shared her support of Kamala Harris in the 2024 election via Instagram, had also experienced a major fall from grace in the final years of her daytime talk show—one she addressed in her Netflix comedy special last year.\nEva Longoria\nLast November, Longoria told Marie Claire that she was “privileged” enough to have her family split their time between Spain and Mexico. “I get to escape and go somewhere,” she continued. “Most Americans aren’t so lucky. They’re going to be stuck in this dystopian country, and my anxiety and sadness is for them.”\nDays later, Longoria clarified her remarks in a phone call with Ana Navarro on The View’s podcast, explaining that she did not relocate directly because of Trump’s reelection. “Will you please let them know I didn’t move out of the United States because of Trump?” said Longoria. “I’ve been in Europe for almost three years…. I didn’t leave because of the political environment. I left because my work took me there.”\nRichard Gere\nGere’s move to Spain last November with his Spanish wife, Alejandra Silva, and their children, was also not directly motivated by politics. The couple sold their $10.8 million Connecticut home so that Silva could be closer to her family. “For Alejandra, it will be wonderful to be closer to her family, her lifelong friends, and her culture,” Gere told Vanity Fair España at the time. “She was very generous in giving me six years of living in my world, so it’s only fair that I give her at least another six living in hers.”\nSophie Turner\nFor some stars, an overseas move is more explicitly political. After years spent between Los Angeles and Miami, the Game of Thrones star shared that in the aftermath of her split from Joe Jonas, she had largely relocated to her native Britain. “The gun violence, Roe v. Wade being overturned…Everything just kind of piled on,” she told Harper’s Bazaar UK last fall. “After the Uvalde [school] shooting, I knew it was time to get the fuck out of there. I’m so happy to be back. I never feel like myself when I’m not in London.”","summary":"Courtney Love is the latest performer to pack her bags for political reasons, following similar moves by Rosie O’Donnell and Sophie Turner.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/its-frightening-now-celebrities-moving-abroad-amid-donald-trump-20","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/67dae3f7994d0c1126491edc/16:9/w_2992,h_1683,c_limit/vf325-departing-celebs.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 15:45:36","author":"Savannah Walsh","authors":["Savannah Walsh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.096},{"id":302011032,"title":"'Hiding': GOP lawmakers dodge 'angry' voters as anti-Trump backlash intensifies","text":"With President Donald Trump almost two months into his second term, many GOP lawmakers continue to encounter angry voters at town hall events.

Derrick Van Orden (R-Wisconsin). In Van Orden's district, Democratic Minnesota Gov.

Such claims are hysteria, as evidenced by a Wednesday op-ed entitled What is a trans woman, really? That the article was written by PEN America President Jennifer Finney Boylan, a transgender individual, tells the reader all they need to know about just how Trumpy the Post is, or, more accurately, isn’t.\n\nAfter spending several paragraphs alluding to various fictional characters who had alter egos or disguises or real people who had alternative names, Boylan appropriated womanhood:\n\nThese questions matter to me, as a transgender woman, because the Trump administration’s attacks on us are, in some ways, founded on the supposition that women like me are ‘really’ men. Whenever I hear, for instance, the simplistic edict that there should be ‘no men in women’s sports,’ my first instinct is to agree. Because transgender women are not ‘really’ men. We are women. We may have different histories than other women, but then, every woman has her own history.\n\nBoylan continued by lamenting:\n\nDonald Trump’s election has released a tide of vitriol against transgender people (and women in particular; most of our nemeses seem oblivious to the existence of trans men). The silence of our alleged allies this last month has been stunning to me, and some of our allies have even volunteered to throw us under the bus in hopes of rebranding themselves as mainstream. Does Gavin Newsom — who came out against trans women in sports last week — really think that the MAGA base will embrace him now? Or is it possible that conservatives will see him as ‘really’ a liberal? Hmm, let’s think.\n\nLogic has never been a strong suit for the transgender movement and Boylan was no exception, “It is worth observing that many of the people scolding me about God not making mistakes are wearing glasses. Or hearing aids. Or have pacemakers. So far as I know, no one accuses someone wearing glasses or hearing aids of fraudulence, or sees the existence of someone saved by a heart-monitoring implant as an affront to divine intentions.”\n\nBecause God never decried medical advancement. While some people may come to view their conditions as God’s plan for their individual life, nobody would ever argue that God’s plan for humanity is bad vision. If it were, He wouldn’t have given us eyes. Boylan isn’t arguing for the gender equivalent of glasses, but rather eye gouging.\n\nBoylan concludes by writing:\n\nThe greatest obstacle for us is a lack of imagination.\n\nBy which I mean, only a person without imagination could think that Superman is ‘really’ Clark Kent. Only a person without imagination could think that a butterfly is “really” a caterpillar. Or that a trans woman is ‘really’ a man.\n\nWithout imagination, it is easy to believe in things that are simple, and superficial, and wrong.\n\nWith it, we can begin to understand the lives of those who are different from ourselves — and respond to their struggles with compassion, and kindness and grace.\n\nThe human mind constantly battles between logic and imagination. Logic without imagination is a lunatic asylum where conspiracy theorists are convinced of their correctness because people contradicting them is proof that the conspiracy is real, but what Boylan is arguing—imagination without logic—is believing that there is no such thing as truth or that Superman is a real being.","summary":"Between the decision not to endorse Kamala Harris and CEO Jeff Bezos’s move to restrict the opinion page to only columns that support free markets and personal liberties, there has been a heavy amount of weeping and gnashing of teeth among liberals over the fate of the Washington Post and how Bezos has sold out to Donald Trump.

Tim Walz (D) for mocking the plummeting stock prices of Tesla. \n\nWalz jabbed Musk over the falling stock price of Tesla during a speech in Wisconsin on Tuesday as he continues to keep up his national profile since losing the 2024 election with former Vice President Kamala Harris in November. Walz told the audience that he frequently checks the stock price of Tesla. \n\n“On the iPhone, they’ve got that little stock app. I added Tesla to it to give me a little boost during the day,” Walz said, noting that the stock price is continuing to drop. \n\n“And if you own one, we’re not blaming you. You can take dental floss and pull the Tesla thing off,” he added. \n\nMusk responded to Walz’s comment in an early morning post to social media platform X on Wednesday. \n\n“Sometimes when I need a little boost, I look at the @JDVance portrait in the @WhiteHouse and thank the Lord,” Musk wrote. \n\nTesla has been plagued by a number of issues since the start of President Donald Trump’s term as many Americans protest Musk’s role in Trump’s administration. On Tuesday, Tesla stock fell about 5.3%. \n\nJPMorgan analysts told clients last week that they expect Tesla to report its lowest number of deliveries since the third quarter of 2022 and an 8% decline from the first quarter of 2024, according to a Forbes report. \n\nTesla dealerships have also seen massive ongoing protests,nicknamed “Tesla Takedowns,” for several weeks.

He promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles. \n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \n\nOur journalism needs your support.

That means Courtney Astolfi is back in the house after not being here last week. Good to hear her voice. It’s Today in Ohio, the news podcast discussion from Cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer. I’m Chris Quinn here with Laura Johnston, Lisa Garvin and Courtney Astolfi. I mentioned yesterday that we’re turning some of these conversations into individual stories on our website using AI to help generate them, although a human’s hands are all over these things.\n\nand they’re getting red in large numbers. people asked for something like this, this may be the answer. We’ll keep experimenting. Check them out on cleveland.com. Northeast Ohio knows well the value of Head Start programs to help kids be ready for school, but those programs are suddenly under threat from the out of control Trump administration, which is slashing jobs and initiatives with abandon. Laura, how many Ohio children benefit from Head Start?\n\nLaura (01:02.696)\n\n33,465. This is the children who attended Head Start in the 2023-2024 school year, and that’s according to the Big Ten Early Learning Alliance, which is this research collaboration among professors at Big Ten universities. So it’s not just for sports anymore, and that includes Ohio State. They put out this research brief because Project 2025 advocated for eliminating the program, and we know that that’s kind of been a playbook.\n\nfor the Trump administration. The White House’s Department of Government Efficiency, DOJ, has cut other programs that serve vulnerable people such as Department of Veteran Affairs, USAID, all sorts of things that people have been protesting against. And the report says that changes to Head Start would actually be particularly consequential in rural areas where Head Start makes up a large share of the available early care and education. Of course, Head Start is 60 years old. It serves families\n\nor below the federal poverty level by providing early learning for kids and educational and employment supports for parents as well as for kids with disabilities. So it is wide-ranging and what’s interesting in Ohio is that we’ve got a whole lot of rural areas.\n\nChris Quinn (02:14.943)\n\nI can’t understand. Well, I do understand it. You know why? This is a program that helps a lot of kids who are in poverty. A lot of kids in poverty are not white. Trump administration has shown that it has no regard for anybody who’s not white or as one of the listeners to our podcast pointed out yesterday, white males. So, so I get why they’re doing it. This helps people in poverty of people of color get caught up in school. He doesn’t care about that, but we know.\n\nLaura (02:21.041)\n\nChris Quinn (02:43.297)\n\nin Northeast Ohio, how important those first five years of life are for brain development to get kids ready for school. And Head Start is, barely makes it in. We need more programs aimed at helping children this year on get ready. If we cut this, it’s going to set Ohio just back and back and back. All the employers that say,\n\nWe need competent people to be employees. They should scream about this because this is about the future.\n\nLaura (03:12.116)\n\nAbsolutely. And what’s interesting is, like you said, rural areas are going to be hit the hardest. So that is not necessarily people of color. mean, if you look at the demographics of Ohio. So I don’t know if this is something that’s protected by that rural kind of agrarian feeling that is so overwhelming in Ohio. I completely agree with you. We did the first 2000 Days project years ago.\n\nat Cleveland.com and the Plain Dealer. And what’s shown is that if kids are under duress and they’re distressed and their families have trauma or whatever, kids can’t grow. Their brains don’t develop properly. It’s like lead in the houses, right? You’re just creating kids with problems and Head Start helps to get kids ready for school, but it also provides that early childhood, the high quality early childhood.\n\ncare that is so important that these kids grow up to be productive, successful, happy, healthy members of our society.\n\nChris Quinn (04:18.587)\n\nI’m glad we did the story to put it in the perspective because now people will know how this could have a very dire impact on Ohio if he does it. All those people that voted for Trump, this is the result of that. You’re listening to Today in Ohio. Because we were chagrined to learn we were mispronouncing it, we asked Jeremy Pelzer to write a story so everyone would know how to say it right.\n\nWhat did we learn Courtney about the pronunciation of a certain Ohio gubernatorial candidates name?\n\nCourtney (04:52.234)\n\nYeah, with the race heating up here, it’s good to know that Republican contender Vivek Ramaswamy pronounces his name as Vivek, not as Vivek as lots of folks have been mispronouncing it since he did his presidential bid back last year. And Vivek kind of corrected the record on the pronunciation of his name. Back during a Fox News interview in July, 2023, he did so with a freestyle rap, which was kind of cute to watch.\n\nHe pointed out that Vivek rhymes with cake. So that’s an easy way to remember his name. The Columbus area Republican is going up against AG Dave Yost and potentially others in the Republican primary race for governor. And like I said, since he ran last year, he’s faced all sorts of mispronunciations. Former vice president Mike Pence was one of those who called them Vivek and his last name has been Butcher too. But when we’ve seen Vivek on the\n\ncampaign trail, he’s really tried to emphasize his first name to obtain that needed name recognition. And we talked to political consultants who tell us that it’s common for folks with difficult or longer last names to rely on that shorter first name to really stick in people’s brains for when they go to the polls.\n\nChris Quinn (06:11.267)\n\nI’m just surprised he hasn’t made more of an issue of it because I’ve heard people mispronouncing this everywhere. It wasn’t just us. And it was only because I think Lisa brought it up. Yeah. And we said, well, boy, how do you pronounce that? And started looking that we realized how wrong we were getting it. Of course, Lisa is the former broadcast person who had to be very focused on name pronunciation. So we appreciated her bringing that to\n\nLisa (06:22.203)\n\nYeah, it was me yesterday.\n\nChris Quinn (06:39.159)\n\neveryone’s attention. Hopefully this will start to spread and people will at least pronounce his name correctly.\n\nCourtney (06:46.028)\n\nWhat’s interesting is that Jeremy went out and talked to some longtime Ohio political consultants and they kind of talked to us about the politics of names and name recognition. And one told us that having a different name like Vivek’s can really be a plus in a race. Terry Casey was talking to us about campaigning for another difficult name candidate back in the eighties, Scott Olslinger from North Canton. And Casey told us that when voters were introduced to him,\n\nThey were more likely to actually remember his name because it was unusual. So Casey said this kind of setup can be a challenge, but it can also be an opportunity.\n\nChris Quinn (07:23.705)\n\nWell, it didn’t help Kamala Harris, that’s for sure. How many times was her name mispronounced before people came to terms with it? You’re listening to Today in Ohio. Lisa, what does the future of our energy bills look like in the vision of the Ohio Senate?\n\nLisa (07:40.591)\n\nWell, there’s a lot of stuff to go through here and some of it’s actually good stuff. So let’s get rolling here. This is Senate Bill 2, also known as the Energy Bill, and it’s one of its co-sponsors, Senator Bill Reineke, a Republican from Tiffin. He says a floor vote is possible today in the Senate. Among the things, and this is interesting, ESPs, which are electric security plants, which we really commonly known as riders.\n\nThese are charges that are put on our bill for capital projects. They’re not itemized in our bills. So Senate Bill 2 would eliminate ESPs and riders. It would be replaced with a full rate review every three years. Some utilities have gone over 10 years without a full rate review. And some people have said that they’re using riders and that’s kind of a sign of overcharging. They would also end the bailouts of two coal plants in Ohio and Indiana.\n\nthat were given those subsidies in 2019, customers have paid nearly $680 million to three utilities since then, 172 million last year alone. The bailouts will end when the bill becomes law, not in 2028. And, an attorney and lobbyist for AEP, Frank Strigari says,\n\nThey’ve asked for a reasonable transition time. They said if we don’t get it, it could be higher cost to our customers if we have to raise capital from our investors. But lawmakers were unmoved by that argument.\n\nChris Quinn (09:03.853)\n\nChris Quinn (09:10.081)\n\nWhat this is a great story that’s on cleveland.com in that it takes complex issues and makes them very easy to understand. And you’re right. It’s loaded with stuff. One of the most interesting parts of this story is that first energy has not sought a review of its rates in years and years. And the legislators are speculating it’s because they’re getting all this money from those riders you discussed and that their rates are too high.\n\nLisa (09:27.875)\n\nChris Quinn (09:38.745)\n\nPart of the requirement of this bill would be a three-year review of electric rates, which would finally squeeze First Energy out of jamming us for all the money they don’t need.\n\nLisa (09:51.223)\n\nRight, exactly. And you know, these riders, know, another thing was customer refunds, which is tied to the riders. It forces utilities to refund all costs after the Ohio Supreme Court finds that they were unreasonable, unlawful, or otherwise improper rate charges. So, yeah, it sounds like they’re kind of, as you said, squeezing the utilities with this bill and I’m glad to see it.\n\nChris Quinn (10:15.467)\n\nWe’ll see how long it stays that way. First Energy has been able to buy these people off repeatedly. You’re listening to Today in Ohio. What was the point of the Cleveland Browns seeking to file an amended complaint in their lawsuit to block the city from impeding their move to Brook Park where they want to build a covered stadium, Laura?\n\nLisa (10:17.42)\n\nLast, yeah.\n\nLaura (10:37.15)\n\nThey wanted to make clear that really they’re still in greater Cleveland. So the Modell law does not apply because they’re not trying to move out of state basically. So the Brown’s attorneys on Tuesday asked a federal judge if they could file an updated lawsuit. So they didn’t officially file it. They asked if they could, but they attached this updated lawsuit. And it said that they didn’t really have a lot of new legal arguments, but it tried to show that this is different.\n\nthan when Art Modell moved the team to Baltimore in the 90s. And that was when it was still under the lease with the city. It says that they’re just moving just outside the city limits, not 375 miles away. And that this way we won’t overburden Cleveland taxpayers with a new stadium. At the same time that we were talking about this story in the newsroom, I got a basically press release kind of like thing to...\n\nBrown’s fans just doubling down that they want to relieve Cleveland of any expense to update the current field and they want this new home.\n\nChris Quinn (11:45.271)\n\nYeah, the press release they sent out was basically doing what their filing did. It’s doubling down on the idea we’re not moving. And look, let’s face it, whether you think Brook Park is a good idea or bad idea, whether you think it should be in Cleveland or not, the idea of the Art Modell law was to stop a team from departing the way they did when they went to Baltimore. It was not something like they did in Boston, where they just moved the team elsewhere.\n\nLaura (12:04.596)\n\nMm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\n\nChris Quinn (12:12.949)\n\nin the region. They would still be the Cleveland Browns. And I’ve said from the beginning, I don’t think this Art Modell law is constitutional. I think once this gets to the adjudication process, it’s going to get tossed. But for some reason, they clearly think they need to emphasize this because like you said, there’s not a single new legal argument in the amended lawsuit they want to file. They just want to go deeper in saying, we’re not moving. We’re not moving.\n\nLaura (12:41.833)\n\nChris Quinn (12:41.965)\n\nAnd then the thing to the fans saying that I wonder if they did a survey and people are misunderstanding.\n\nLaura (12:48.828)\n\nMaybe. I’m not really sure. mean, the city’s still saying the city’s still fighting this, right? I mean, there’s two current lawsuits going on, one in common please court, one in the federal court. And it’s clear the Browns want the federal court one to go forward while the city wants the common please to go forward. And that one is not even quite as far along. So we’ll have to see this play out. But the Browns say, you know, we need to break ground on a new stadium next year.\n\nwho are to be ready for the start of the 2029 season. I’m sure they would like all of this legal mess to just go away and everybody to sign off on everything and they can build their $2.4 billion home with a whole lot of taxpayer money.\n\nChris Quinn (13:32.813)\n\nI don’t know about everybody signing off and everything, but I do think the courts are going to resolve this fairly quickly. It seems like it’s a pretty simple question to address and they’ll quickly address it. I wish I understood the reason for yesterday’s bluster. I have said a long, long though, that if there’s no publicity about this new stadium in the media for about six, eight weeks, they create something. And maybe that’s what this is. Maybe nobody’s talking about this. Let’s throw something out there.\n\nCause like you said, there’s really nothing new. You’re listening to Today in Ohio. Speaking of the Browns, Courtney, they have top draft picks this year for the first time in four years because of that horrifying deal they made for Deshaun Watson. They’re turning their draft into a higher level party than in the past. How so?\n\nCourtney (14:20.906)\n\nYeah, in what couldn’t be a more appropriate move for Browns fans who have suffered through, you know, a losing home team for decades. The iconic singers behind Don’t Stop Believing are coming to town. So Journey, you know, the megastar rock group is going to be playing an exclusive concert for current Brown season ticket holders during the draft party here in Cleveland on April 24th. And ticket holders are going to get one free ticket for each sheet on their account.\n\nAnd the party’s going to run for about two hours until 8 p.m. when the first round kicks off and then everybody will be turning their attention to the draft.\n\nChris Quinn (14:57.017)\n\nWhat’s sad in Cleveland is the draft. The draft day is the biggest day of the year because they stink. So the games are not big. The opening day game isn’t big as the draft. The draft is the one day where you can dream a little until your dreams are dashed onto the rocks and they have another losing season.\n\nCourtney (15:18.798)\n\nYeah, I mean, the team does have the number two overall pick, like you mentioned, and they’ve got 10 total picks, but I, you know, we’ll have to see where they go in building up the team seats and ticket holders at least have this fun to look forward to. They’re supposed to be getting updates through the Brown’s mobile app. So if you’re a ticket holder, keep an eye on that. And then starting the week of April 7th seat selection is going to kick off. So fans can get in there and try and snap up the best seats available.\n\nYou know, one thing I was curious about this was whether this concert is open to others as well, or is it just for season ticket holders?\n\nChris Quinn (15:55.747)\n\nI don’t know. You gotta give them credit though for trying to make a bigger event. is something that fans get pretty excited about. I was surprised when I saw this one roll across.\n\nCourtney (16:04.866)\n\nBig name, big name.\n\nChris Quinn (16:06.681)\n\nYou’re listening to Today in Ohio. The Republicans managed to make transgender politics central to their message in 2024 and the Democrats fell flat on their faces trying to handle it. Those issues remain political long after the election though. Lisa, what’s the latest on a severe Ohio law involving transgender children?\n\nLisa (16:30.511)\n\nYeah, the 10th Court of Appeals has put a hold on House Bill 68, which is a House, an Ohio law banning transgender minors from getting hormone or treatment or puberty blockers. This reverses a lower court decision that let that law take effect last August. So the Ohio ACLU sued on behalf of two transgender teenagers. They say that the fact that this is being combined with a ban on transgender athletes and girls sports.\n\nviolates Ohio’s single subject rule. The original judge in this case, Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Michael Holbrooke said both of these had a common purpose to regulate transgender people and that it was a legitimate subject. The appellate court agreed on that point, but they said that House Bill 68 was sweeping and inflexible, you know, with parents' ability to access medical care for their kids.\n\nDavid Yost is going to appeal. says, there’s no way I’m going to stop fighting for these unprotected kids. And he said that the ruling green-lighted permanent medical interventions against minors.\n\nChris Quinn (17:37.507)\n\nYou remember this is the law that Mike DeWine vetoed because he said parents should be the ones making decisions about the kids, not state lawmakers that are pushing their Trumpy Trumpy agenda. I’m not surprised Yost did what he did, but he’s going the Trumpy way. And Vivek Ramaswamy is the Trump candidate. And if Yost keeps trying to do that, he’ll be Matt Dolan in this. He’ll come in second and he will not be the candidate.\n\nLisa (17:40.633)\n\nChris Quinn (18:05.805)\n\ngovernor. I’m surprised he’s not trying to stand apart. He didn’t just say I’m going to defend it. You quoted it. He was over the top and harumph, harumph, trump, trump, trump, trump. So we’ll see what the Ohio Supreme Court ultimately rules. That’s where it goes next, right? You’re listening to Today in Ohio. How far have vaccination rates fallen for Ohio kindergartners just as measles is picking up steam in parts of the country, Laura?\n\nLisa (18:12.603)\n\nMm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\n\nLisa (18:23.931)\n\nLaura (18:36.02)\n\nwe are down to 85.4 % of kids, kindergartners, up to date on their vaccines for this school year. That’s down from 86 % in the previous year. And that’s all of the vaccines. If you’re looking at the MMR shot, the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine that dropped from 89 % last year to 88.3 % this year. And that compares to about 92.5 % in 2019, 2020 before COVID.\n\nshut down the world. That national rate at the time was 92.7. actually, sorry. The national rate is 92.7 for last year. So Ohio is quite a bit underneath the national average, which doesn’t surprise me when you look at how Trumpy this state is and how there’s, it’s kind of like solar, right? It’s, it’s this idea. We don’t want to look at the science. We’ve somehow made vaccines\n\npartisan and if you’re super Republican, you don’t like to be told what to do and that includes vaccinating your kids even against some devastating diseases and measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases. It’s highly transmissible, spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, up to two hours lingers after that sick person has left a room. So we’re seeing a lot of it in Texas right now.\n\nChris Quinn (20:01.795)\n\nWell, and the other thing it does is it makes your body forget all of the bacteria and viruses you’ve had. So when you get them again, your immune system no longer is ready to block it. That’s one of the nice things about your immune system is it has a memory, the antibodies are there and it wipes them out. What’s sad about this is that medicine is science. It’s fact. And history is replete with people who eschew science and then suffer as a result. So\n\nLaura (20:28.232)\n\nChris Quinn (20:30.903)\n\nWhen you’re not vaccinated and you get measles, you’ll see people saying, what was me? What was mean? You’re thinking you’re a moron. You could have avoided this with a simple embrace of solid proven science instead of following your Facebook wacko friends down rabbit holes of anti-science nonsense.\n\nLisa (20:51.597)\n\nOr our, you know, health and human services guy is saying the same thing, take vitamin A. And with measles, you have to be at 95 % vaccination for herd immunity. We’re way beyond, that.\n\nChris Quinn (20:54.063)\n\nChris Quinn (21:01.943)\n\nI know. I know. it just happens over and over again. These people that stand on their wacko theories are the ones who ultimately suffer. And it’s just sad because we used to be a nation that embraced scientific achievement.\n\nLaura (21:19.794)\n\nRight. Yeah. People think like vitamin A will cure you and this. Right. And it’s the head of the Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, the head of the Ohio health who had this press conference yesterday and he’s basically trying to tell people, I mean, he is Mike DeWine’s appointee, right? This is a Republican standing there saying vitamin A isn’t going to work. That’s not going to keep you from getting the measles. Like go get vaccinated. And I,\n\nChris Quinn (21:23.375)\n\nCod liver oil. Just take cod liver oil, you won’t get the measles.\n\nLisa (21:24.804)\n\nLaura (21:49.33)\n\nI don’t know how you get through to people, especially when you’ve got people like Kennedy.\n\nChris Quinn (21:55.213)\n\nYeah, it’s, it’s, well, we pay the price and then people learn the hard way. You’re listening to Today in Ohio. Cleveland saluted what could be a huge investment in affordable housing Tuesday. Courtney, how would it work?\n\nCourtney (22:09.366)\n\nYeah, so yesterday at City Hall, heard from the mayor, Key Bank and others who were kicking off the Cleveland Housing Investment Fund. It’s now officially open for business. And with this, we’re talking about a pool of about $38 million that the city hopes to eventually grow to $100 million through fundraising. But that money, whatever the final amount is, would be used to help pay for new and renovated housing projects across the city.\n\nWe know Cleveland, like many places, is always looking for more housing options. And this is one way that the city and KeyBank want to tackle this. This fund is going to be managed by the national nonprofit community development organization, LISC. They have a local arm here. But what this means is that Cleveland chipped in about $18 million, including some of its federal aid from the American Rescue Plan Act. And they got KeyBank to chip in $20 million.\n\ntowards this fund. One key bank executive told us this was really kind of her idea. She went to Detroit to watch, you know, the fruits of a similar fund up there and said, well, why can’t we do this in Cleveland? And part of the goal of the money here is to provide low interest loans and equity investments into housing developers projects who may not have the financing they need to quite get their project over the finish line. This fund will inject about one to $5 million per project.\n\nAnd then hopefully the money’s repaid back over time so it can be used on future housing projects.\n\nChris Quinn (23:40.291)\n\nThe idea of making it loans and not grants makes so much sense because you just get to keep recycling that money. So many times in the past this kind of thing has been given out as grants and once it’s gone, it’s gone. Hopefully this will work to keep it going into the future for as far as we can see.\n\nCourtney (23:58.702)\n\nYeah, and if they’re able to raise that hundred million they’re hoping to, they say this could help create up to 3000 new units in Cleveland and they’re going to be focusing these investments in projects that, you know, the money can flow all over the city, but the goal is really to focus on the not so hot markets. So not Ohio city, not downtown, not university circle. They want to pump this money more into places like Glenville and Huff.\n\nChris Quinn (24:24.973)\n\nWell, I hear there’s going to be some new housing out in Brook Park. You’re listening to Today in Ohio. Ohio is a big farming state. Ohio is the birthplace of aviation. What does Congressman Max Miller want to combine those two facts into as an initiative?\n\nLisa (24:42.117)\n\nWell, I’m glad to say that at least some congresspeople from Ohio are focusing on non-MAGA stuff. So the Bay Village Republican is stewarding the Farm to Fly Act. This would help develop what’s called sustainable aviation fuels, or SAFs, within existing U.S. Agriculture Department programs. So this would give farmers new markets for biofuels, mostly corn, and it would help the rural economy develop and also build domestic energy resources, all good ideas.\n\nThere’s wide bipartisan support for this in Congress and from a wide range of groups including Ohio Corn and Wheat, the Renewable Fuels Association and Airlines for America. A current bill similar to this went to the House Agriculture Committee in draft form but it never made it to the floor last year so Miller’s gonna try again.\n\nChris Quinn (25:32.729)\n\nIt’d be good if they found another outlet for all of the crops we grow here. Although I keep waiting for the electric planes that when you talk about future airports and the difference that they’ll need and take off and landings, we haven’t seen much discussion about that. And I guess while Trump is president, we won’t. You’re listening to Today in Ohio. How many special and official days, weeks and months have Ohio lawmakers put on our calendars, Laura?\n\nLaura (26:03.464)\n\nWell, there are 104 special days, 92 months, and 26 weeks. Obviously, if you add that up, that is way more than one year. So we have a lot of overlap. This is according to the Legislative Services Commission. And 70 % of them have been pushed by Republicans, many of them in recent decades. Some of them recognize the accomplishments of famous Ohioans like John Glenn, Dean Martin, and Toni Morrison.\n\nOthers are historical figures you may never heard of, like Charles Fallis, who’s the first black professional football player. A lot of them are to raise awareness about a disease or a chronic condition. The question is, are they meaningful when so many of them obviously overlap?

Shares of Tesla surged as much as 90% in the weeks after Trump won the election, but they now trade about 7% below what they did on Election Day. Though Tesla is joined by its big tech peers like Apple and Google as stock market laggards, Tesla’s losses tie largely back to the public’s increasingly polarized view of Musk, according to several analysts. Numerous Wall Street firms have downgraded their forecasts for Tesla sales this year, citing significant sales declines in regions in which Musk has been outspoken in right-wing politics, like Germany, where Tesla’s February sales declined 76% year-over-year. Tesla’s brand issues have “grown more acute since Mr. Musk stepped into a more divisive new role in government,” JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote to clients last week, referring to Musk’s position as the newly created head of the Department of Government Efficiency, the commission largely leading Trump’s efforts to downsize the federal government footprint. Tesla showrooms have been the site of protests nationally, and Musk derided a Las Vegas incident in which multiple Teslas were set on fire as domestic terrorism. “Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks,” Musk wrote Tuesday.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n“I think there’s something poetic about a schoolteacher being in this fight against the richest man in the world,” the former high school teacher Walz told The Minnesota Star Tribune on Tuesday.\n\nForbes Valuations\n\nMusk is worth roughly 300,000 times more than Walz, according to Forbes’ calculations.

Bush. “When opportunity knocks, most people don’t have their bags packed,” Powell told the audience. Carr was so energized by the line that he made it his own rise-up mantra and now recites it when speaking to law students himself.\n\n The 46-year-old has been unloading a lot of baggage lately. Ever since Donald Trump bumped Carr up to chair of the FCC in November (after naming him a commissioner during his first term), Carr has attacked the country’s media, entertainment and even tech giants with a cool fury, threatening their business and, critics say, attempting to bully them into more favorable coverage of the president.\n\n “Americans no longer trust the national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,” he wrote in a December letter to Bob Iger, one of several recent accusatory missives to media executives. “ABC’s own conduct has certainly contributed to this erosion in public trust.” He noted ominously that he’ll now be “monitoring the outcome” of unrelated financial negotiations with the network’s station affiliates.\n\n Historically concerned with the sundry matters of broadcast licenses and station fines, the FCC hardly would seem like the centerpiece of a major media-suppression effort. Nor would a conservative former lawyer who has spent his entire adult life in D.C. — and who was so incensed by the Obama administration’s comparatively minor intervention on net neutrality that he railed against “government control over [Americans’] lives” — seem like the man to commandeer it.\n\n Yet Carr has done just that, reading signals from a media-bashing Donald Trump and mercilessly carrying out his will in ways even the president might not have called for.\n\n “Off the leash sounds about right,” says Victor Pickard, a professor of media policy and political economy at Penn’s Annenberg School for Communication and longtime chronicler of the FCC.\n\n Carr has demanded top executives explain themselves in private meetings, warned media companies against prioritizing the hiring or promotion of diverse candidates, and criticized their editorial choices; he has held out the threat of combative public hearings and, yes, intimidated executives with the specter of potentially costly reviews of their dealings.\n\n From state-funded outfits like NPR and PBS to private behemoths like Disney, Comcast and even Google, almost no player in modern broadcast media has been spared, as Carr has turned a wonky office into a cudgel against media companies and, many experts say, the free press itself.\n\n If Carr has his way, the decades-long rise of Fox News and other right-wing media will now be accompanied by the diminishment of plenty of moderate, centrist and liberal ones.\n\n Or as Democratic Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal characterized Carr’s actions in an inquiry he announced March 13 — “unprecedented, intrusive investigations against media broadcasters under arbitrary and capricious pretenses.”\n\n For much of its 90 years, the FCC has moved tentatively. Created to oversee the nation’s airwaves at a simpler time when there were just radio stations and a few TV networks — and, as an independent agency that doesn’t report to the White House but to Congress, free of political urgencies — the FCC largely has been reluctant to set ambitious policy or wade into controversy. Even its most famous modern moment in the spotlight — when it levied $550,000 in fines on CBS and its affiliates for 2004’s Super Bowl Nipplegate — had a kind of workaday quality to it. (The fines were overturned on appeal.)\n\n The commission features five members serving five-year terms each, with some possibility for extensions. The apparatus is almost calibrated for caution: Each party is guaranteed at least two commissioners at all times. The president names new commissioners, and the chair and the full commission must vote on any policy decisions. The GOP will have a majority after Trump’s nominee for the fifth seat, Republican Olivia Trusty, is almost inevitably confirmed by the Senate.\n\n In the months since he’s been handed that job, however, Carr has left all cautious precedent behind. He has opened a probe into Comcast over its DEI policies (“invidious forms of DEI discrimination”) and sent a letter to Verizon telling it to move faster to dismantle its own. He also has reinstated formal complaints by various parties that were dismissed by his predecessor, Democrat Jessica Rosenworcel: one against CBS for allegedly doctoring its Kamala Harris 60 Minutes interview per a Trump lawsuit; one against ABC for its moderation of a presidential debate; another against NBC for booking Harris on SNL. (Never mind that the network gave Trump a spot on a much higher-rated NFL game the next day.) He has not, however, revived a dismissed complaint against Fox News over its alleged post-2020 election disinformation.\n\n Carr has investigated public broadcasters NPR and PBS for airing commercials, a not-so-veiled effort to, as the formal legal term has it, bust the liberal organizations’ balls.\n\n But it’s not just Joe Pesci machismo on his mind. All of these individual bullying moments could, in critics’ view, add up to something much more dire and concrete: remaking the media landscape as a decidedly conservative stronghold with little tolerance for dissent. It’s no coincidence Comcast, a frequent Carr target, owns MSNBC, MAGA’s biggest critic.\n\n “I think Brendan Carr’s objective is not unlike Viktor Orbán’s in Hungary,” says Jessica J. González, co-CEO of Free Press, a long-standing D.C. progressive group focused on media-regulation reform. “There’s a much broader play to quash the independence of media systems.” Such efforts are working, she says, citing ABC News’ recent payment of $15 million to settle a libel lawsuit against George Stephanopoulos and reports she’s gotten of local news stations backing off Trump stories after getting letters from Carr.\n\n Carr provided the world with a largely undisguised road map for his intentions in the 922-page manifesto of Project 2025, for which he wrote the section on the FCC. He listed seven objectives. The first was to “promote freedom of speech” — which critics note is a recurring euphemism for platforming hard-right views and a major divergence from the FCC’s actual mandate, “to make available so far as possible, to all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, rapid, efficient, nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication services with adequate facilities at reasonable charges” (according to the Telecommunications Act of 1996).\n\n In his treatise, Carr presented a strikingly expansionist view of the FCC, suggesting it be deployed on everything from slowing Chinese AI development to funding Elon Musk’s Starlink. Carr talks of a desire to “reempower the local broadcasters to feel like they have the freedom to serve their local communities” but pointedly leaves out the national media, for which, his missives suggest, he harbors little love.\n\n Lean and with a closely cropped white beard, Carr has gone after even unexpected parties. Tech companies don’t fall under the purview of the FCC — the agency regulates only traditional communications. That renders him powerless to do something about a longtime pet peeve — social platforms’ alleged quashing of right-wing voices.\n\n So the ex-lawyer has targeted Alphabet/Google’s YouTube TV for “discriminating against faith-based programming,” recently opening an inquiry into the tech megalith for what he says are efforts to restrict the upstart Hallmark competitor Great American Network from gaining visibility on its service.\n\n “I’m writing to determine whether YouTube TV has a policy or practice that favors discrimination against faith-based channels,” Carr wrote to Google and Alphabet’s chief execs earlier in March, citing the unrelated Section 230 that gives tech platforms legal protection against liability, also a pet peeve.\n\n Which channels a private company chooses to carry is not part of the regulatory agency’s mandate. And Great American Network has a popular channel on sister platform YouTube. Yet Carr concluded his letter by ordering YouTube executives to contact his office so that they can come in for “a briefing.”\n\n Two days after Carr’s X post March 7 that he “has received complaints that Google’s @YouTubeTV is discriminating against faith-based programming,” Donald Trump Jr. reposted the message and broken-telephoned it into, “Is anyone surprised that Google is discriminating against Christian faith based programming?” Some 14,000 users liked the post.\n\n A Carr representative did not respond to multiple requests for an interview for this story. At a state-of-media event hosted by online outlet Semafor in Washington three weeks ago, Carr told interviewer Ben Smith that what he was doing was no different than what a Democrat-led FCC was doing during the Biden years and aimed to apply the law without regard for party.\n\n But ex-FCC chairs from both parties have raised the alarm over his rampage. George H.W. Bush-era chair, Republican Alfred Sikes, told journalist Oliver Darcy in February that the First Amendment “should be foundational not just in the Constitution but in the way the FCC acts,” joining chairs from the Clinton and Obama eras in criticizing Carr.\n\n Carr can react with almost Muskian joy at criticism, even from a fellow Republican. “I feel bad for the three of them,” Carr said in a statement to Darcy about Sikes and the two Democrats. “I [have to] imagine it’s hard when the curtain is closing on your career.”\n\n When Sheryl Crow said she was selling her Tesla and donating the profits to NPR as an anti-DOGE protest, Carr baited her on X: “I know celebrities are hesitant to weigh in on hot button issues, so I appreciate Sheryl Crow making an argument here — not through words alone, but through her actions — that Congress should not force taxpayers to subsidize NPR.”\n\n He also casually tosses out conspiracy-adjacent ideas that the FCC during the Biden years favored George Soros, and routinely goes on Fox News to tout Trump’s greatness and a new golden age. Post-inauguration, Carr popped onto the network to say that Trump’s return to Washington made “patriotic Americans feel like the sense of decline, the sense of malaise that’s taken over the country over the last four years is ending.”\n\n Carr was born to lawyer in Washington. His late father, Tom, subsidized his own studies at Georgetown in the 1960s by working in the mailroom at the Dirksen Senate building, then got a law degree at the University of Virginia. Tom Carr would go on to work in a host of D.C. cases and at one point even represented Richard Nixon.\n\n The only son of Tom and his then-wife, Barbara, Brendan Carr spent his whole childhood in the D.C. area, eventually following in his father’s path to Georgetown. Conservative politics were never far from his own résumé. When he was 29, he got a job clerking for appellate judge Dennis Shedd, a former chief counsel for conservative South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond.\n\n Communications also was wired into Carr’s career from an early point. He interned at the FCC while in law school, and when he graduated in 2005, he went to work for Wiley Rein, the law firm co-founded by Dick Wiley, the chair of the FCC under Nixon and Ford who pushed hard for deregulation. In his seven years at the firm, Carr litigated appeals of FCC orders and advised clients on how to gain FCC approval.\n\n By the time Carr left the firm to serve as a legal adviser to the FCC in 2012 at the tender age of 33 (he’d soon work for the idiosyncratic Republican commissioner and eventual chair Ajit Pai), anything less than an ascent to chair would have been a surprise script-turn.\n\n His activist streak both online and in the halls of the agency’s L Street headquarters has alarmed those who’ve devoted their lives to studying the FCC.\n\n “This is jaw-droppingly different from how the agency has worked. I’ve never seen this — and I’ve literally written a book about the FCC,” says Kim Zarkin, chair of the communications department at Westminster University in Utah (and author of The Federal Communications Commission: Front Line in the Culture and Regulation Wars).\n\n Zarkin says some past commissioners have successfully advanced an ideological agenda. Reagan’s commissioner in the 1980s, Mark Fowler, pushed for deregulation and a repeal of the Fairness Doctrine requiring balanced coverage, leading to the media polarization of today.\n\n And there have been cases of so-called “regulation by raised eyebrow” or “jawboning,” in which a critical speech from an FCC chair sends broadcasters scurrying. In the early ’70s, Nixon’s chair Dean Burch gave a harshly worded speech about so-called “topless radio”— a new concept that involved women calling in to stations with intimate details of their sex lives — that caused stations to drop the format, which effectively killed it.\n\n But efforts to bring news outlets to heel have never been attempted by an FCC chair before. “Brendan Carr is breaking the mold — and not in a good way,” Zarkin says.\n\n Those who’ve sat in Carr’s seat also express disbelief at what’s happening.\n\n “I’m about as worried as I can be about the future of the FCC,” Michael Copps, a commissioner at the agency during both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama years and for a time also the acting chair, tells THR. “I would say Carr is the most ideological chairman we’ve ever had — and the most political.” There have been 35 previous chairs of the FCC.\n\n Whether Carr really is a hardcore ideologue or simply an opportunist using the ascendant ideology to gain attention is debated in regulatory circles. Those arguing for the latter note that prior to his Project 2025 authorship, Carr had rarely sounded many prosecutorial hard-right notes. If adoration from Trump and Musk was the goal, it has been achieved. Carr has been summoned to Mar-a-Lago at least four times.\n\n Despite a childhood in the wealthy suburb of McLean, Virginia, and years at a tony law firm, Carr has taken pains to cultivate an image as an everyman. He has been known to wear cowboy boots to FCC meetings and sometimes puts on a hard hat and gets into a lift to rise to the top of a broadcast tower for photo ops, as he did in Alabama in February.\n\n “It is always a fun experience to get up in the air and hang with a tower crew,” Carr said at the time.\n\n Such populist gestures feel odd to those who’ve interacted with Carr in legal settings. A person who knew him early in his career says the lawyer operated with a shrewd confidence in boardrooms all over the capital. “He is often the sharpest legal mind in the room, and he doesn’t mind at all if you know he’s the sharpest legal mind in the room,” says the person, who asked for anonymity so as not to jeopardize a potential relationship with him.\n\n Free Press’ González believes Carr “is more dangerous” than Trump or Musk. “Those guys are outsiders. Brendan Carr has been inside the building and knows the administrative procedure better than anyone.”\n\n Carr’s associations with the new power elite also worry experts. “I see Carr as an acolyte of Musk, and I find that relationship troubling,” says Fritz Messere. Messere was assistant to Republican FCC commissioner Mimi Dawson during the Reagan years, and he tells THR that he is especially concerned given Carr’s criticism of the agency’s decision several years ago to deny Musk’s bid for $900 million in rural broadband subsidies to Starlink, along with decisions on other potential benefits to Musk still to come.\n\n Beltway chatter speculating on Carr’s post-FCC future has sometimes put him in the private sector working for Musk. When Carr made a pilgrimage to SpaceX’s facility in Boca Chica, Texas, to pose with Musk, he hailed the businessman’s achievements as potentially “driving efficiency in government, and unleashing a new cycle of American innovation.” Musk has publicly approved of Carr’s dissent with the FCC’s Starlink decision.\n\n The solicitation of other global figures’ interest has been a regular feature of Carr’s public persona. He has posted shots of himself with such figures as far-right U.K. politician Nigel Farage. This has a twofold effect: It solidifies Carr’s conservative bona fides and positions him as a global player.\n\n And despite his glee in sniping at the press, Carr seems willing and occasionally even enthusiastic to engage with mainstream reporters, chatting with a host of them at a reception after the Semafor conference, perhaps realizing that while he doesn’t think the national media can be trusted to report fully, accurately and fairly, they can be counted on to bolster a bureaucrat’s career.\n\n For all his MAGA cred, Carr has not always been aligned with Trump, a point he seems keen to downplay. As commissioner, he talked a lot about the risks posed by TikTok — “I don’t believe there is a path forward for anything other than a ban,” he said in 2022. But he was noticeably quiet on the matter when Trump granted ByteDance a reprieve shortly after inauguration. (Carr long has taken a hard stance against China, for years maintaining a photo on X of a Hong Kong protester of Chinese rule.)\n\n He has also been a vocal critic of Section 230, a position that puts him at odds with the tech broligarchs who have cozied up to Trump.\n\n Meanwhile, Carr’s wife, Machalagh Carr, a former chief of staff to former House Speaker and frequent Trump rival Kevin McCarthy, a year ago launched a small-government-minded consulting firm with Bill Barr, Trump’s former attorney general turned rival who famously said that as a result of Jan. 6, Trump “shouldn’t be anywhere near the Oval Office.” As with so many Republicans who once shook their heads about Trump, these affiliations aren’t discussed. Machalagh Carr as of February works for Palantir Technologies, the secretive data-mining operation that is making a big push into the U.S. government and causing activists to raise alarm bells.\n\n The effort to push back on Carr’s Trumpian agenda is beginning to take root, though with what degree of success remains unclear. Sen. Blumenthal filed his inquiry with two internal FCC departments, asking them essentially to investigate their own agency, but how much freedom or interest they have in going against Carr remains to be seen.\n\n FCC commissioner Anna Gomez has become the agency’s Democratic voice of resistance, Chris Murphy to Carr’s Trump, even as her ultimate impact is similarly unclear. “Stoking partisan culture wars is not the FCC’s job,” she volleyed when the Comcast inquiry began. She also said that “we cannot allow our licensing authority to be weaponized to curtail freedom of the press” when all those complaints were reinstated.\n\n And corporate media hasn’t always backed down. On March 10, CBS pushed back against a complaint accompanying a $20 million Trump lawsuit over 60 Minutes‘ editing of its Harris interview. In a filing with the FCC, it said the complaint “envisions a less free world in which the federal government becomes a roving censor.” Talk about a potential settlement, which has been discussed internally, has now quieted as CBS seems willing to fight it out, even as the FCC reviews parent company Paramount’s sale to Skydance and Carr is likely to seek concessions.\n\n Carr may also be constrained by mandate. One of his biggest ideological pet peeves, the repeal of Section 230, can only be changed by an act of Congress. And while he can certainly hassle media companies, the FCC has fairly limited power over major firms not seeking approval for a merger, a group that currently includes everyone but Paramount. In many cases, the most he could do is tie them up in lengthy hearings. Should any of them sue, they’re likely to win.\n\n Yet experts warn Carr doesn’t need to be practically or legally effective to blunt the media.\n\n “The fear of getting dragged into something expensive is what does the trick,” says Pickard, the Annenberg expert, citing the ABC settlement. “Just knowing they could attract attention is what keeps them supine and not asking tough questions.

Here's all about her","text":"A Democratic mega-donor is making headlines for funding nationwide anti-Tesla protests, while her ex-husband continues to support Elon Musk. Who is Karla Jurvetson, the donor behind the protests?Karla Jurvetson, a California psychiatrist and Democratic megadonor, has contributed more than $500,000 to anti-Tesla protests through Indivisible Action, a political action organization connected to a nonprofit that was organizing the demonstrations against the tech billionaire, Elon Musk, as per reports.Ironically, her ex-husband, billionaire Steve Jurvetson, is one of Elon Musk's most trusted allies. The protests have resulted in vandalism and controversy, adding to the political battle over Musk and Tesla.What’s the connection between Karla and Elon Musk’s close circle?Billionaire Steve Jurvetson, 58, is still on Musk's SpaceX board and was an early investor in Tesla. He was on the board until December 2020. In 2008, when Musk was running low on funds to support SpaceX and Tesla, Jurvetson played a crucial role in saving the billionaire, as quoted in a report by The NY Post.Steve Jurvetson told Business Insider in 2012 that he's really an American hero, more than anyone I've ever met. All along, I was a believer. Why is Tesla facing backlash?This week, Musk or Us protests are being sponsored nationwide by the advocacy organization Indivisible, which is headquartered in Washington.

She also donated over $9.5 million to Democratic progressive candidates, such as Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and former New York Rep. In 2023, she also gave Kamala Harris' Victory Fund over $100,000.During the 2020 election cycle, Karla Jurvetson became one of the most active donors to Democratic women in politics. She contributed almost $15 million to Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and $30 million to the pro-abortion Emily's List PAC.According to court documents, the mother of two and psychiatrist with a Stanford education married Jurvetson in 1990 and filed for divorce in 2016. After Draper Fisher Jurvetson, his venture capital firm, launched an investigation into Steve's romantic relationships with several women at the company, he resigned from the position a year later. Jurvetson had several simultaneous affairs, according to an internal investigation. Jurvetson refuted the accusations in a Facebook post on November 14, 2017, saying that his private life should remain private and not be up for debate, as quoted in a report by The NY Post.Steve Jurvetson still backs Musk and runs the Jurvetson Foundation, a left-leaning charity,with his new wife.FAQsWho is financing the anti-Tesla protests?Karla Jurvetson, a Democratic megadonor and the ex-wife of Tesla investor Steve Jurvetson, has given more than $500,000 to Indivisible Action, the organization behind the demonstrations.Why are there protests against Tesla?Indivisible Action organized the protests to criticize Elon Musk's influence over government policies, accusing him of pushing agendas that benefit billionaires while harming working families.","summary":"Karla Jurvetson, a Democratic megadonor, has funded over $500,000 to anti-Tesla protests, despite her ex-husband Steve Jurvetson's support for Elon Musk.

A shocking new report reveals that he would have still won if every registered voter showed up to the poll. The analysis by David Schor, who is the head of Blue Rose Research, unveils that instead of just the 1.7 points he surpassed Harris by, he would have earned the popular vote by five points had every registered voter turned up to the poll.\n\nSpeaking to Eric Levitz of Vox, Schor, who is a data scientist for the Democratic Party, said, “So I think that a ‘we need to turn up the temperature and mobilize everyone’ strategy would’ve made things worse.” He continued, “There were a lot of Democratic voters who were angry at their party last year.” According to the 26 million voters interviews in 2024, conducted by David’s firm, a large amount of registered Democrats turned against their own party. On the other hand, moderates and those who are disengaged favored the Republicans.\n\n“They were mostly moderate and conservative Democrats angry about the cost of living and other issues. And even though they couldn’t bring themselves to vote for a Republican, a lot of them stayed home. But basically, their complaints were very similar to those of Biden voters who flipped to Trump,” Schor added.\n\nAccording to the research, politically disengaged voters who kept neutral during the 2020 election, began turning up to the Republicans in 2024 by 15 points. David revealed that while Kamala Harris maintained her approval amongst the white liberals, white moderates, and white conservatives, much like the 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton, she faced a double-digit declines amongst the Asian and Hispanic voters.\n\nThis is David Shor of Blue Rose Research, a respected data scientist, confirming what we non-MAGAs know in our bones. Shor confirms why Mr. Trump favors, in Trump’s own words, the “poorly educated.” The less you understand what it going on in the world, the more you support Trump pic.twitter.com/oFbXvJKqGH\n— Stephen Rodio (@SteveRodio) March 18, 2025 \n\n“After the cost of living, it was the size and scope of the federal government, the budget deficit, immigration, crime and also health care. And people trusted Republicans on these issues by double-digits – except for health care, where we had a two-point advantage, which was much lower than our traditional advantage on that issue. The reality is that, to the extent that Democrats try to polarize the electorate on self-descried ideology, this is just something that plays into the hands of Republicans,” the Blue Rose Research head concluded.\n\nDuring the 2024 election, Donald Trump earned over 2.5 million votes more than he did in 2020, while his rival Harris saw a dip of seven million. The Republican President gained ground in all of the 50 states, including those called Blue. The groundswell of popularity propelled Trump to a decisive victory.\n\nIf CNN will admit it’s down to 29%, just how bad is it REALLY? pic.twitter.com/k5FEkUQWaS\n— Jere_Memez (@Jere_Memez) March 16, 2025 \n\nMeanwhile, according a recent CNN poll, the approval for the Democratic Party has now hit a new low of just 29 percent, which is an at least 20 point dip since Trump left the White House 4 years ago. At that time the favorability was 49 percent. In addition, according a new NBC poll, released on Sunday, only 27 percent voters have a positive view of Kamala’s party, which is the lowest ever in the network’s polling.\n\nOn the other hand, The approval of Republicans has remained steady. The party stands at 36 percent including 79 percent approval among Republicans and leaning independents.","summary":"A new shocking report by Blue Rose Research revealed whether Trump would have still won the 2024 election if every registered voter turned up to the poll.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/would-donald-trump-have-still-won-the-2024-election-if-every-registered-voter-showed-up","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Donald-Trump-12.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 12:33:27","author":"Moupriya","authors":["Moupriya"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.252},{"id":301861608,"title":"Tim Walz admits Trump's appeal is making people feel like they're 'part of something bigger'","text":"Former Democratic vice presidential candidate and current Minnesota Gov.

Presidents are allowed to use the autopen and courts will not presume a dead-hand conspiracy.\" \"Many of these were high-profile pardons, including for his own son, that Biden acknowledged publicly,\" he added. \"There is also a problem with standing unless the issue comes up in a government effort to indict a recipient. That does not mean that the disclosures are not deeply troubling.\" Autopen signatures are ones that are automatically produced by a machine, as opposed to an authentic, handwritten signature. TRUMPS TAKES JAB AT BIDEN OVER 'AUTOPEN SIGNATURE' FOLLOWING CONCERNING REPORT OVER WHO RAN THE WHITE HOUSE President Donald Trump has been sounding the alarm on Biden's prevalent use of an autopen for official presidential documents, most notably for official presidential pardons before he left office in January. On Monday morning, Trump posted on Truth Social that Biden's pardons for individuals connected to the Jan. 6 select committee investigation another are \"void.\" \"The 'Pardons' that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen,\" Trump wrote. \"In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them! The necessary Pardoning Documents were not explained to, or approved by, Biden. He knew nothing about them, and the people that did may have committed a crime. Therefore, those on the Unselect Committee, who destroyed and deleted ALL evidence obtained during their two year Witch Hunt of me, and many other innocent people, should fully understand that they are subject to investigation at the highest level,\" he added. At the heart of the issue over the use of an autopen, which have been frequently used by presidential administrations across the decades, is concern over Biden's mental acuity when he served in the White House. Trump said Sunday that though he uses the autopen for documents such as letters, he does not use an autopen for legally binding documents. BIDEN'S 'AUTOPEN SIGNATURE' APPEARS ON MOST OFFICIAL DOCS, RAISING CONCERNS OVER WHO CONTROLLED THE WH: REPORT Trump's declaration that Biden's pardons are now \"void\" sparked a wave of legal questions to swirl — with many legal experts reporting that this is uncharted legal territory. \"This dog will not hunt,\" Turley added on X. \"It may be worthy of investigation by Congress, but the pardons are unlikely to be seriously questioned by the courts.\" Michael O'Neill, the vice president of legal affairs at Landmark Legal Foundation — a conservative legal advocacy group that works to defend the Constitution — told Fox News Digital that, to his knowledge, \"there hasn't been a case where the limits of this power have been challenged.\" \"Biden's pardons at the end of his term certainly test whether there are any limits to the presidential pardon power,\" O'Neill said. \"Can a president issue blanket pardons encompassing any crime an individual may be accused of over ten years? This is a legitimate question that has yet to be addressed by the courts because no president has abused this authority until Biden. Another question is whether the pardons are valid if executed without the president's knowledge — i.e. via autopen.\" \"If an individual who has received a pardon is indicted, they would, most likely, assert pardon as an affirmative defense,\" he added. \"Lower courts would, most likely, uphold the dismissal, leaving it to SCOTUS to define the contours of the pardon power. How SCOTUS decides such a case is unknown.\" LIES ABOUT BIDEN'S AGE, HEALTH DURING HIS PRESIDENCY IS A 'SCANDAL OF EPIC PROPORTIONS,' SCOTT JENNINGS SAYS The Heritage Foundation's Oversight Project first sounded the alarm on Biden's use of an autopen earlier in March, reporting that an autopen signature was used on the vast majority of official documents researchers reviewed, except for the signature on Biden's official announcement that he was dropping out of the presidential race in 2024. Heritage's Project Oversight posted a memo on its ongoing investigation into the matter Monday, reporting that researchers are wading through copious amounts of \"public documents discharging non-delegable Presidential powers containing former President Joseph R. Biden’s signature.\" The memo determined that \"individuals in the Biden Administration other than the President appear to have used a device called an autopen to affix the President’s signature onto some of the most controversial clemency warrants of his Presidency.\" The Project Oversight memo offered a legal explanation that \"if President Biden’s non-delegable official actions were not his own, then they are invalid.\" \"Start with the Constitution,\" the memo reported. \"Multiple Constitutional provisions, like the pardon power, vest those powers solely in the President. In those cases, the President affixing his signature is his execution of the acts as President.\" \"The Founding Fathers contemplated these issues when writing the Constitution. For example, Article I, Section 7, Clause 2 of the Constitution lays out the role of the President to sign or veto legislation. Early debates at the Constitutional Convention concerning this provision made it clear that regardless of the structure of the Executive Branch, the President would maintain a necessary affirmative approbation of legislation presented to him. The act of the President affixing his signature manually to a bill is his consent and is the very act that causes a bill to become law; it is in no way ministerial. Until he signs, there is no law,\" the legal explanation continued. The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel in 2005 under former President George W. Bush's administration determined that the president is permitted to use an autopen to sign bills into law. \"You have asked whether, having decided to approve a bill, the President may sign it, within the meaning of Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution, by directing a subordinate to affix the President’s signature to it, for example by autopen,\" the opinion stated. \"This memorandum confirms and elaborates upon our earlier advice that the President may sign a bill in this manner.\" The Project Oversight memo, however, hit back that the opinion is \"wrong.\" \"This opinion is wrong. But even that erroneous opinion was clear that ‘(w)e emphasize that we are not suggesting that the President may delegate the decision to approve and sign a bill, only that, having made this decision, he may direct a subordinate to affix the President’s signature to the bill,’\" the memo said. CHUCK SCHUMER CONFRONTED WITH OLD CLIP OF HIMSELF DECLARING BIDEN'S DECLINE 'RIGHT-WING PROPAGANDA' Concerns over Biden's mental acuity when he was in the White House have been under the microscope as legal questions fly over the use of the autopen and Trump's declaration his pardons were voided. Biden kicked off 2024 in the driver’s seat of the Democratic Party as he keyed up a re-election effort in what was shaping up to be a rematch against Trump. In February 2024, however, Biden’s 81 years of age and mental acuity fell under public scrutiny after years of conservatives questioning the commander in chief’s mental fitness. Scrutiny over Biden’s mental fitness rose to a fever pitch in June 2024 after the president’s first and only presidential debate against Trump. Biden missed his marks repeatedly in the debate, tripping over his responses and appearing to lose his train of thought as he squared off against Trump. The disastrous debate performance led to an outpouring from both conservatives and traditional Democrat allies calling on the president to bow out of the race in favor of a younger generation. Biden dropped out of the race in July, with former Vice President Kamala Harris taking up the mantle in his place, though concerns over his health have continued months later as Trump speculates that Biden was unaware of signing the pardons specifically. WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT DIDN'T CREATE A BANNED WORD LIST, LEAVES LANGUAGE CHOICES UP TO AGENCIES White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was peppered with questions about the autopen during Monday's White House press briefing, saying Trump's Truth Social was raising the question whether Biden was aware of the pardons when he signed them. \"Was his illegal signature used without his consent or knowledge? And that's not just the president or me raising those questions,\" Leavitt said on Monday. \"According to the New York Post, there are Biden officials from the previous White House who raised those questions and wondered if the president was even consulted about his legally binding signature being signed onto documents.\" \"And so I think it's a question that everybody in this room should be looking into, because certainly that would propose, perhaps criminal or illegal behavior if staff members were signing the president of the United States' autograph without his consent,\" Leavitt continued. TRUMP DOESN’T USE AUTOPEN FOR LEGALLY BINDING DOCUMENTS, UNLIKE BIDEN, WHITE HOUSE SAYS Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also recounted earlier in January to the media that Biden reportedly didn’t remember signing an executive order freezing new liquid natural gas exports in 2024, which has increased scrutiny surrounding Biden's mental acuity. \"I didn’t do that,\" the former president said in 2024, Johnson recounted during an interview with the Free Press’ Bari Weiss in January. \"Sir, you paused it, I know. I have the export terminals in my state,\" Johnson said he told the president at the time. \"I talked to those people in my state, I’ve talked to those people this morning, this is doing massive damage to our economy, national security.\" \"I walked out of that meeting with fear and loathing because I thought, ‘We are in serious trouble — who is running the country?’\" Johnson said of the 2024 meeting. \"Like, I don’t know who put the paper in front of him, but he didn’t know,\" he added. Turley said Johnson's comments on Biden suggest the \"use of dead-hand power,\" but that legally pursing a challenge will nonetheless likely be a non-starter. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The account of Speaker Johnson on how Biden seemed unaware of signing a major piece of legislation does suggest the use of a dead-hand power by staffers,\" Turley wrote. \"In the end, this is the most difficult type of allegation to pursue since the key parties will be unified in claiming full knowledge and approval by the president.\" Fox Digital reached out to Biden's office for comment on his use of the autopen and Trump's comments he was unaware of the pardons he signed, but did not immediately receive a reply.

Donald Trump’s dominance of Washington has left Democrats struggling to remain united in their opposition to the president.\n\nA hit to their fundraising resources could prove catastrophic, although Democratic strategists claimed another platform would likely replace ActBlue.\n\nActBlue has come under repeated scrutiny from Republicans, including recently from Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), who, in a letter to FBI Director Kash Patel, called for the bureau to investigate the platform.\n\nRep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) wrote to the Treasury Department asking for an investigation into ActBlue charities and whether it “had reason to know it was handling payments that could support terror.”\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) similarly accused ActBlue of money laundering in an interview with One America News Network. “The way they set up their accounts, it would be very easy to launder money into there through fake credit card accounts, and fake names, and things like that,” Comer said.\n\nElon Musk, a key Trump ally who leads the Department of Government Efficiency, slammed ActBlue for allegedly bankrolling protests against Tesla, the company he co-founded and leads as CEO.\n\n“An investigation has found 5 ActBlue-funded groups responsible for Tesla ‘protests’: Troublemakers, Disruption Project, Rise & Resist, Indivisible Project and Democratic Socialists of America,” he wrote last week on X, the social media platform he owns.\n\n“ActBlue is currently under investigation for allowing foreign and illegal donations in criminal violation of campaign finance regulations,” he continued. “This week, 7 ActBlue senior officials resigned, including the associate general counsel.”\n\nThe platform is also facing internal problems, with at least seven senior officials resigning, according to the New York Times.\n\nActBlue hired a lobbyist last year to defend itself against the growing calls for investigations. \n\nBut with Democrats still struggling with a unified resistance to a Trump-dominated Washington, ActBlue’s problems come at a vulnerable moment.\n\nDemocratic strategist Brad Bannon suggested the GOP attacks against ActBlue will likely help Republicans to fundraise, putting even more pressure on Democrats to look elsewhere for fundraising efforts.\n\n“I think the Republicans have a much better local infrastructure than Democrats do,” Bannon said. “And I think it would be very important for Democrats to develop a much better, fundraising infrastructure at the local level and also communications at the local level.”\n\nDemocrats have long pioneered small donor fundraising, with former President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign leading the way as Republicans struggled to match their counterparts.\n\nActBlue, in particular, is a fundraising juggernaut for Democrats. \n\nLast year, the company announced that small donors raised roughly $50 million for then-Vice President Kamala Harris in less than 24 hours after she became the leading candidate to replace former President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee in July.\n\nIn the two decades since it launched on June 28, 2004, ActBlue has raised more than $13 billion for Democrats. \n\nYet Democrats remain shut out of power in the White House and in Congress, making platforms such as ActBlue vulnerable to GOP-led investigations.\n\nSome strategists said a focus on diversifying fundraising at the local level may be the better strategy ahead of future high-profile elections.\n\n“If ActBlue is vulnerable to political attacks, sorry, ActBlue, but you are funding political campaigns from across the board, so of course you’re going to be under scrutiny and so respectfully … that’s the price you pay,” said Michael Ceraso, a Democratic strategist who has worked on several presidential campaigns. “No one should feel sorry for ActBlue.\n\n“But state party chairs and state party can look at this and go, ‘OK, let’s reevaluate. Is there a more affordable way to do this? Is there a way to raise money?'” Ceraso continued. “‘Is there a way to empower state parties to do this? Is there a way to hyperlocalize this, to leave us less vulnerable and to put more money in our pockets to support our candidates?'”\n\nEven before the most recent calls for investigating ActBlue, Marva Diaz, a political strategist and California Target Book publisher, has advised clients not to use the platform depending on the logistics of the campaign.\n\n“In local races, especially when it’s not a partisan race, I usually advise my candidates not to use ActBlue because it is such a strong brand,” Diaz said. “And we don’t want to pigeonhole them as only the Democratic candidate that may or may not be then seen as accessible, or someone who brings all sides together by the independents and the Republicans.\n\n“I have candidates that use multiple different types of platforms, and if one of those platforms happens to run into problems and go away, there are other solutions out there,” Diaz continued. “And I assume then there’d be an opening in the market for other people to launch.” \n\nDemocrats’ party infrastructure problems go beyond a weakened ActBlue, however. \n\nBannon, the Democratic strategist, also suggested that Democrats will need to step up a concerted communication effort to counter the unity the GOP currently faces.\n\n“When Donald Trump sneezes, some local Republican committeewoman in Topeka gets a cold,” Bannon said. “When Chuck Schumer sneezes, very few Democrats are going to notice it at all. The Republicans have a much better infrastructure relationship between their national party and their local party. And I think Democrats should do everything they can to develop a better infrastructure and relationship with Democratic fundraising and communications forces at the local level because the Republicans have done a much better job on that than we have.”\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers questioned by the Washington Examiner about ActBlue’s difficulties did not appear to know what was going on. \n\nBut a source familiar with Democratic campaigns explained that many lawmakers leave the minute details of how money is fundraised to consultants. \n\nLawmakers are “probably not overthinking the logistics and the tools that [their] team is using every single day,” said the expert, who requested anonymity to speak freely.\n\nOther Democratic campaign groups, such as the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, did not respond to requests for comment, while the House Majority PAC and Progressive Change Campaign Committee declined to comment.\n\nBut should ActBlue lose its status as the dominant fundraising platform, Diaz said another platform would likely take its place.\n\n“ActBlue is not free,” Diaz said. “They charge for their services. So I’m assuming there’s going to be other people out there saying, yes, I can take that risk of launching my version of a platform, because it’s going to be beneficial and profitable.”\n\nActBlue did not respond to a request for comment.","summary":"The Democratic Party’s premier fundraising machine is facing an uncertain future amid investigations, staff departures, and political headwinds.

The original concert, however, was cancelled because of Trump’s executive order ending diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\n\nCorrespondent Scott Pelley narrated six of the show’s seven stories since Trump’s inauguration, including Sunday’s. He examined the administration’s policies toward Ukraine and tariffs, looked at changes in the Justice Department and reported on firings of government watchdogs. Shortly after his piece on the dismantling of USAID, Elon Musk suggested “long prison sentences” for those working on the show.\n\nAll came at a time when television’s most popular and influential news broadcast was being watched to see how it would respond to a unique pressure.\n\n“This may be a lawsuit that is designed to intimidate, but they are clearly making a statement that they will not be intimidated,” said Tom Bettag, a longtime television news producer who worked under Mike Wallace and Morley Safer at the CBS show.\n\nPelley, meanwhile, has quickly become a polarizing figure.\n\n“Another week, another 60 Minutes’ story trying to discredit Trump policies,” Brent Baker, editor of the conservative media watchdog NewsBusters, wrote on X Sunday night.\n\nThe context surrounding the 60 Minutes reports\n\nTrump’s lawsuit, coupled with a parallel Federal Communications Commission investigation, accuses “60 Minutes” of election interference for the way it edited Bill Whitaker’s interview last fall with Trump’s 2024 opponent, Kamala Harris.\n\nTwo sound bites, broadcast on “60 Minutes” and CBS’ “Face the Nation,” depicted Harris giving different responses to Whitaker in a discussion about Israel.\n\nCBS said Harris made both comments in her answer to Whitaker and that the two shows ended up using different parts of a long sound bite. CBS argued the apparent discrepancy was typical of editing and not, as Trump has suggested, that different remarks by Harris were used to make her look better.\n\nCBS parent Paramount Global filed new motions in the past two weeks to get both the lawsuit and the FCC probe dismissed. Still, Shari Redstone, head of Paramount, is reportedly anxious for a settlement, much like Disney agreed to pay USD 16 million in December to end Trump’s lawsuit against ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos. Complicating matters is Paramount’s proposed merger with Skydance Media, which needs approval from the Trump administration.\n\nMany at CBS News resist a settlement, insisting “60 Minutes” did nothing wrong. The show’s executive producer, Bill Owens, told his staff last month that he would not apologise as part of any prospective settlement.\n\n“My precious 60 Minutes’ is fighting, quite frankly, for our life,” correspondent Lesley Stahl said earlier this month in accepting a First Amendment award from the Radio Television Digital News Association. “I am so proud of 60 Minutes’ that we are standing up and fighting for what is right.”\n\nNeither Owens nor Pelley would comment on whether the show is trying to deliver any sort of message about the lawsuit through its work. Bettag said he believed “60 Minutes” is motivated by the importance of the stories.\n\nWhat the show has done during the past two months is striking, said Bettag, now a journalism professor at the University of Maryland.\n\n“The 60 Minutes’ people are such committed journalists that they’d consider it foolish to be doing these stories because of what is a frivolous lawsuit,” he said. “The lawsuit pales in comparison with the monumental changes Trump is trying to implement. Those correspondents and producers know that this is a moment that requires their very best work.\n\nSome of the segments were unusually urgent for the newsmagazine, which tends to do longer-range stories that could take months to produce.

They engaged in deliberate deception to interfere with the last election. They deserve a long prison sentence.”\n\nOther news organisations have done admirable work under difficult circumstances, said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor. Besides Pelley, he cited the news staff of the Washington Post at a time the newspaper’s owner, Jeff Bezos, has shown more friendliness to Trump.\n\n‘The concert that was not meant to be heard’\n\nSunday’s “60 Minutes” story involved some elite high school students — each of them either of either Black, Hispanic, Indian or Asian descent — who had earned the right to play with the Marine band before the show was called off.\n\nCBS worked with Equity Arc, an organisation devoted to increasing the number of minority students playing classical music, to organise a show for family and friends of the students outside Washington, D.C.. Retired members of military bands were brought in to work with the students. CBS News, which wanted to interview the students, paid for the travel and lodging of 22 of them.\n\nPelley called it the “concert that was not meant to be heard.”\n\n“The original Marine Band concert would have been seen by hundreds,” he said. “Here tonight, these musicians are being heard by millions.”\n\nPelley’s March 9 report, “Firing the Watchdogs,” was about Trump’s efforts to fire inspector generals and thwart others who protect whistleblowers in government agencies.

No, not because he utterly failed on his promise to lower grocery prices on \"day one\" of his administration, instead ordering tariffs that will almost certainly make goods more expensive. Nor because he failed to end the war in Ukraine in \"24 hours,\" as promised. And not because instead of canceling \"Crooked Joe’s electric vehicle mandate,\" as promised, Trump ended up hawking Teslas from the White House lawn, to placate his benefactor Elon Musk. \n\nNo, the MAGA faithful are furious because they expected Attorney General Pam Bondi to release the \"Epstein files.\" The hope is that the files will finally fulfill the QAnon prophecy of Trump revealing Hillary Clinton and Tom Hanks as blood-drinking Satanists, leading to the mass arrests of Democrats, Hollywood celebrities and anyone else they don't like. The imagined list of who will be exposed as a child-murdering pedophile varies from conspiracy theorist to conspiracy theorist, but the basic faith remains the same: the Justice Department is sitting on files showing that deceased sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein had a \"client list\" that Trump would soon release, proving their most depraved fantasies true. \n\nAs the horrific economic and human consequences of Trump's second term start to manifest, the administration knows they need to keep the conspiracy theorists fed more than ever, lest the MAGA base starts asking hard questions about why prices are rising and Grandma's Social Security check is missing. So Bondi set out to give the \"Epstein files\" weirdoes some candy. The problem is that, while Epstein was indeed a monstrous sex predator, there is no \"client list.\" Journalist Julie Brown, whose award-winning work with the Miami Herald uncovered the extent of Epstein's crimes, said as much on X: \"There is no Jeffrey Epstein client list. Period. It's a figment of the internet's imagination — and a means to just slander people.\" The names of Epstein's associates — including Trump — are already public knowledge. Most of those people aren't implicated in his crimes, however. \n\nWant more Amanda Marcotte on politics? Subscribe to her newsletter Standing Room Only.\n\nTo placate the QAnon crowd, Bondi brought a bunch of MAGA influencers to the White House and had them pose with binders labeled \"Epstein Files.\" When it turned out there was nothing new in the folders, however, the conspiracists unloaded their rage at Bondi. Since then, she's been trying to convince them she has a \"truckload\" of files she will soon release, but nothing's been released. Since then, major MAGA influencers from Russell Brand to Laura Loomer have cried foul. One influencer with nearly 180,000 X followers, Philip Anderson, declared, \"Pam Bondi, arrest Democrat criminals or resign.\"\n\nIt's easy to see why they're so frustrated that Bondi won't simply falsify some documents. After all, making stuff up is what conspiracy theorists do all day. Bondi's boss, Trump, also thinks nothing of lying, claiming to have \"evidence\" of various conspiracies, when he has no such thing. Elon Musk is on X all day, making up numbers and pretending to have government documents that don't exist. Bondi certainly has no moral qualms about misleading people, which is why she backed Trump's 2020 \"stolen election\" lie. I suspect, however, that fabricating evidence of a crime to frame prominent Democrats like the Clintons or the Obamas is a tougher task. \n\nIt sure is a sticky situation, so the administration finally caved and rolled out Trump himself to deal with it. The president went on the podcast of Sharyl Attkisson, a former journalist with a new conspiracy theorist career. She asked about the \"Epstein files,\" along with other conspiracies Trump falsely promised \"information\" on, adding, \"That’s one of the most often questions I’ve been asked.\" \n\nTrump gave one of his dithering non-answers, claiming both that \"I haven’t heard too much about it,\" but also, \"the bottom line is the records are getting out.\" When Attkisson asked when, he hesitantly answered, \"I would say weeks, yeah — I would say weeks.\" \n\nAh yes, the \"two weeks\" tactic, which is a long-standing favorite of Trump's. Since his first run for president, Trump has avoided contentious issues by promising his answer is \"two weeks\" away. During the 2024 campaign, Trump repeatedly dodged questions about banning abortion, restricting contraception, or repealing Obamacare with lies about how he'll soon be \"announcing\" his best ever, most fabulous policy that would fix all problems in \"the next 14 days.\" The announcements never came, but the strategy worked because Trump could count on the press to forget that he was asked, allowing him to play this game forever. \n\nWill the same strategy work on his base? Sadly, it probably will, but not because they'll move on. It's because they will never give up hope in the \"Epstein files.\"\n\nConspiracy theorists are notorious for keeping the faith that they will be proved right, no matter how often they are disappointed or proved wrong. QAnon has generated reams of \"prophecies\" that have never come to pass. Believers keep hanging in, sure that any day now, Trump will finally unleash \"The Storm,\" their term for the long-promised day the Satanic pedophile conspiracy is revealed and all the Democratic leaders will be arrested.\n\nStill, there is a danger for Trump of losing these people, but to boredom, not facts. If not fed constant promises of dramatic revelations, conspiracy theorists can start drifting away from their cults. Trump understands this need for constant stimulation, which is why he's manipulating his base with false assurances that the good stuff is coming any day now. He's playing the same game with the release of a trove of documents about the Kennedy assassination late Tuesday. Trump even made a joke, which will go over his followers' heads, about how this is a distraction meant to occupy their time: \"“We have a tremendous amount of paper. You’ve got a lot of reading.\" When these files inevitably prove to be underwhelming, Trump will simply make up new lies about other \"documents\" and exciting \"exposes,\" stringing his followers along into infinity. \n\nTrump does this not only due to the sadistic glee he gets from conning his followers, though I have no doubt that's a big part of his motivation. He is no doubt fully aware that, without people whose brains have been fried with online disinformation, his base of power would dramatically shrink. As I detailed after the election, the best predictor of whether someone voted for Trump was how entrenched they were in the world of social media misinformation and conspiracy theories. New analysis released this week by Blue Rose Research confirms it. Reality-based citizens who got their information from legitimate news sources voted overwhelmingly for the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris. But if people get most of their information from sources like TikTok — where nonsense about the \"Epstein files,\" anti-vaccine myths, and demonic possession outperforms staid news reports about the economy — they broke big time for Trump. \n\nTrump cannot legally run for president again (not that he cares about the law), but he still needs to keep millions of people in a constant state of delusion. His actual policies are dramatically unpopular. Voters are starting to panic over Musk's assault on the federal government, which is threatening basic services like Social Security. If people stop paying attention to nonsense like the \"Epstein files\" and start focusing on the real world, they would start to pressure Republicans to do something to stop Trump before he wrecks the economy. He needs to keep folks distracted, and if yelling \"Kennedy\" and \"Epstein\" is what it takes, well, Trump knows the score. He can keep these people waiting \"two weeks\" for files that will never come.","summary":"Using his standard “two weeks” strategy, Trump suckers his conspiracy theorist base to keep the heat off Pam Bondi","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/03/19/snookers-maga-with-epstein-files-promise-i-would-say-weeks/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2024/08/donald_trump_2168360090.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 10:00:06","author":"Amanda Marcotte","authors":["Amanda Marcotte"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.443},{"id":301798006,"title":"Carville says Kamala Harris didn't give a reason to vote for her, has to be 'a lot better candidate' in 2028","text":"Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville spoke candidly about his botched prediction that then-Vice President Kamala Harris would win the 2024 presidential election. In the final weeks of the election cycle, Carville made the media rounds expressing confidence that Democrats would keep President Donald Trump out of the White House, even penning an op-ed in The New York Times titled \"Three Reasons I’m Certain Kamala Harris Will Win.\" \"The polls looked even, alright? I thought that Harris had more money. She also had more storefront locations, she had more doorknockers, definitely had better surrogates with two ex-presidents out there. Trump was going around with Scott Baio or something…. And I thought a combination of all of that would be worth a point and a half. It was not,\" Carville told Fox News Digital in an interview. Coincidentally, Trump ended up winning the popular vote by a point and a half over Harris and ultimately won the presidency with 312 electoral votes.

Some have also floated her as a leading Democratic contender in California's gubernatorial election in 2026 after its current governor, Gavin Newsom, leaves office. When asked whether Harris should either run for governor in 2026 or president again in 2028, Carville refrained from taking a strong position. \"I don't propose that somebody should or shouldn't run for office,\" Carville said. \"If she runs for president again, she's got to be a lot better candidate than she was in 2024. Maybe she is.\" JAMES CARVILLE SAYS DEMOCRATS BROKE HIS ‘FIRST COMMANDMENT OF POLITICS’ WITH ANTI-TRUMP ANTICS The former Clinton operative remained convinced Harris would have been \"a much better candidate\" had Democrats held an open primary following Biden's abrupt exit from the 2024 race, swiping those like CNN commentator Bakari Sellars for talking down such an idea, something Carville suggested was a regrettable decision by his party. But when asked if it were up to him if he'd like to see Harris run again, he again didn't take a firm stance. \"Well, I mean, first of all, I think everybody should run,\" Carville said. \"I have a lot of friends. I would say you should run. You know, the more, the merrier, I think. And look, she's a former vice president. She's a former prosecutor in a big city, apparently very good at it. She's a former state attorney general. So, you know, to the vice president's impressive resume, I mean, who am I to say? But she certainly passes anything you say about who could run for president.

But as a front in America’s culture wars, the topic has become increasingly contentious. The growing visibility of transgender people in society and pop culture, and the spread of new ideas around sex and gender, particularly among young people, have led to emotional public debates about single-sex spaces and sports – and prompted a backlash on the right that’s gone into overdrive since President Donald Trump returned to office.\n\nAs part of his “war on woke,” Mr. Trump has enacted a flurry of policies directly impacting various aspects of life for transgender people. The president has issued executive actions barring transgender women from women’s sports teams and women’s prisons. He’s ordered the military to oust transgender soldiers and stop recruiting others. He’s banned federal funding for gender-transition medical treatments for minors, threatened to withhold funding from schools that “indoctrinate” children, and prevented transgender individuals from self-selecting their gender on passports and other official documents.\n\nThe barrage of actions has left members of the transgender community reeling, while Democrats have been divided over how to respond. “It’s truly terrifying,” says the Rev. Lazarus Jameson, a transgender pastor in Oregon. “Every trans person is asking, How are we going to survive?”\n\nThe Trump administration casts all these moves as a return to “common sense,” protecting women and children from the impacts of what they say is a dangerous social contagion. “Ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women, from women’s domestic abuse shelters to women’s workplace showers. This is wrong,” states one of Mr. Trump’s executive orders. “Efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”\n\nTransgender people and their allies reject those characterizations, calling transgender inclusion a matter of human dignity and basic rights. Many of the president’s directives have already triggered legal injunctions halting their implementation; on Tuesday, a judge temporarily blocked the transgender military ban from taking effect. Some appear to contradict a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2020 that protected transgender people from workplace discrimination. Democratic-run states are also pushing back and strengthening legal protections for transgender residents.\n\nYet the politics surrounding the issue are dicey for both parties. Following November’s election, some Democrats have grown concerned that their party’s full-throated support for protecting transgender rights under all circumstances was alienating mainstream voters and ignoring valid concerns about women’s rights and the unknown effects of transgender youth medicine. The shifting political winds were underscored recently when California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a longtime ally of the transgender community, said on his podcast that he believed allowing transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports was “deeply unfair.”\n\nOther Democrats, however, predict Mr. Trump’s aggressive policies may soon invite a backlash of their own. While polls suggest the president’s position on transgender athletes has widespread public support, the sheer scope of his directives, and the open hostility expressed by some of his allies toward transgender individuals, may ultimately strike voters as needlessly punitive toward a vulnerable minority population. One of Mr. Trump’s very first executive orders, signed Jan. 20, states flatly that there are only “two sexes” and they are “not changeable” – essentially making it the official position of the United States government that all people must adhere to this binary. Critics say it amounts to denying transgender individuals’ very existence.\n\nMost Americans’ views tend to be far more nuanced than the political positioning being put forward by either party, experts say. Polling shows that a majority of people support transgender rights when it comes to things like housing and employment. But when accommodations for transgender individuals are in apparent conflict with other people’s rights, “Support is a lot more squishy,” says Donald Haider-Markel, a politics professor at the University of Kansas who studies LGBTQ+ issues and public opinion.\n\nFor now, he adds, the greater political dilemma lies with Democrats, who pride themselves on championing minority rights, but are also trying to chart their way back to an electoral majority. They need to win some of the culturally conservative, working-class voters drawn to Mr. Trump’s masculine imagery and emphasis on traditional gender roles. “The party is really in the weeds on how to go forward on this, and nobody has staked out a middle path that everyone can agree on,” says Professor Haider-Markel.\n\nA difficult issue for both sides\n\nTo Mr. Trump’s critics, the administration is scapegoating what amounts to a tiny number of people purely for political gain. According to a recent Gallup estimate, 1.3% of all American adults are transgender. The numbers have been rising among young people, however: Among Generation Z respondents, 4.1% identify as transgender, compared with less than 1% of adults born before 1980. Far more adults identify as gay, lesbian, or bixsexual, a percentage that has been steadily rising since Gallup began counting in 2012. (Nearly 1 in 10 now identify as LGBTQ+.)\n\nWhile gay rights advocates rapidly gained popular support and then a 2015 Supreme Court victory established a constitutional right for same-sex marriage, the transgender community is facing growing skepticism and even hostility from conservatives.\n\nMr. Trump’s biggest ad buy in the 2024 campaign highlighted Vice President Kamala Harris’ support for taxpayer-funded transgender surgeries for prisoners – an ad that strategists from both parties described as devastatingly effective. Mr. Trump’s campaign flooded battleground states with versions of the ad, which concluded with the tagline, “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.” A postelection poll by the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, found that 64% of voters had seen ads that criticized Ms. Harris for supporting transition surgery for prisoners and allowing transgender athletes to play on girls’ sports teams.\n\nThe president has leaned particularly into the sports issue, where polls show his position has high levels of public support. A New York Times survey from January found that 79% of respondents believed that athletes who were male at birth should not be allowed to compete in women’s sports. Since recapturing the White House, Mr. Trump has held photo ops with female athletes, and invited a volleyball player who suffered an injury competing against a transgender player to his speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\n“Asking people to pretend that sex isn’t real or doesn’t matter, or that it’s the same thing as gender, has been a huge unforced error” by Democrats, says Doriane Coleman, a professor at Duke Law School. “It’s also been an unnecessary one, as there are different strategies that could have secured protections for trans people that didn’t go to the core of such a significant aspect of most of our lives,” she adds, referring to the sports question.\n\nWhen some Democrats have tried to modulate their party’s position, they’ve often experienced significant pushback. After Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton told The New York Times shortly after the November election that he didn’t want his daughters “run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete,” he was hit with a flood of criticism from fellow Democrats, and his campaign manager resigned. The recent comments from Governor Newsom, along with moves from other Democrats to drop pronouns from their bios and move away from “woke” language, suggest those internal debates are far from over.\n\nStill, others argue that the actions the president has taken have unleashed a wave of hostility toward transgender people that’s likely to repel swing voters. In the first few days of this congressional session, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina publicly and successfully campaigned to prevent the House’s first transgender member, Delaware Rep. Sarah McBride, from using the women’s restrooms in the Capitol. More recently, GOP lawmakers have publicly referred to Representative McBride in hearings and elsewhere as “Mr. McBride.”\n\nEric Stern, a Democratic strategist in Pennsylvania who worked to elect Sen. John Fetterman in 2022, says “being cruel” toward transgender people will ultimately come back to bite Republicans, even if they reap short-term electoral gains. Voters “are going to come around and see what it is, which is a bully picking on a vulnerable community,” he says.\n\nSenator Fetterman has frequently criticized his fellow Democrats for using “woke” language and has sharply broken with the pro-Palestinian left. But he’s remained a staunch defender of transgender rights. Earlier this month, after a GOP bill to bar transgender girls from school athletic competitions failed along party lines, Senator Fetterman posted on the social platform X, “The small handful of trans athletes in PA in a political maelstrom deserve an ally and I am one.”\n\nMr. Stern argues that Democrats who distance themselves from transgender issues that seem unpopular right now are making a bad long-term calculation. “I don’t believe it’s in the interest of Democrats to throw the trans community under the bus. It’s completely reprehensible morally, and I don’t think our base will reward us for sacrificing a community,” he says.\n\nPublic opinion: not a simple yes/no\n\nPolls point to a mixed picture when it comes to public support for transgender rights. A Gallup poll from May 2024 found that a majority of Americans opposed state laws banning medical treatments for transgender youth, but half also said it was “morally wrong” to change one’s gender. The January New York Times poll found that 71% of Americans believed no one under age 18 should have access to puberty blockers or cross-sex hormone treatments.\n\nAnother poll in 2023 by The Washington Post/KFF found that 57% of Americans believe it’s not possible for a person to be a different gender from their sex at birth. But a majority of respondents in that poll also supported laws prohibiting discrimination, including 65% who opposed discriminating against trans people serving in the U.S. military.\n\nSome Democrats argue that Republican targeting of transgender rights echoes the party’s opposition to same-sex marriage in 2004 under President George W. Bush. The Bush campaign leaned heavily into that issue, using ballot referendums against same-sex marriage to help turn out religious voters in the presidential election, while many Democratic officials tried to strike an uneasy middle ground, supporting civil unions rather than marriage. But in the years that followed, public opinion abruptly shifted, with Democrats and ultimately many Republicans embracing the landmark Supreme Court ruling affirming a right to same-sex marriage in 2015.\n\nSome experts point to key differences between the two issues – and the ways the campaigns for rights were waged. Advocates for same-sex marriage purposely highlighted traditional values as part of their campaign. “[People said,] ‘Oh, same-sex couples, they just want to be normal. They want to get married,’” says Darel Paul, a politics professor at Williams College and author of “From Tolerance to Equality: How Elites Brought America to Same-Sex Marriage.”\n\nWhile social and religious conservatives argued that allowing same-sex unions would undermine the institution of marriage, they ultimately failed to persuade the majority of Americans, who generally support allowing consenting adults to make their own decisions. But that’s not the case with gender-transition treatments for children under age 18.\n\nOne of Mr. Trump’s executive orders, which is already being litigated in federal court, prohibits federal funding or support for gender-transition treatments for minors, which he labels “chemical and surgical mutilation” procedures that young people may regret later in life. While U.S. medical associations support these treatments and say they are evidence-based, authorities in Europe have begun restricting them and urging greater caution in diagnosing gender dysphoria, the condition of feeling trapped in the wrong gender.\n\nLast month the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case involving a challenge to a Tennessee ban on transition medicine for minors. Tennessee is among more than a dozen Republican-run states that have imposed bans and restrictions on these practices in the past few years. In 2023, Missouri passed a ban on transition care over the opposition of parents of transgender children amid a controversy over alleged malpractice at a leading transgender clinic in St. Louis.\n\nThat was when Jameson, a social-care worker who had led a church in St. Louis, decided to leave Missouri, relocating to Portland, Oregon.\n\nJameson has been disappointed by the muted response from Democratic leaders to Mr. Trump’s executive actions, though welcoming of the support from blue states. “A lot of politicians don’t seem to think trans people are worth the fight,” Jameson says.\n\nA battle over inclusion in the military\n\nTransgender advocates argue that, like same-sex marriage proponents in the early 2000s, they also just want to pursue a normal life – and the Trump administration is standing in their way.\n\nA group of transgender service members has sued the administration over its ban on transgender troops, arguing that it violates their constitutional rights to equal protection. This week, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the ban’s implementation while the lawsuit works its way through the courts.\n\nThe executive action issued Jan. 27 makes categorical and unfounded claims about transgender soldiers and why they are unfit to serve, says David Gans, a constitutional attorney.\n\nHis organization, the Constitutional Accountability Center, filed an amicus brief in the suit that highlights the parallels between the exclusion of transgender service members and that of other groups once deemed unfit to serve their country – including Black people, gays and lesbians, and women in combat roles. In all these cases, the argument against integration was essentially the same: that allowing them to serve would endanger military effectiveness and unit cohesion.\n\n“The lesson of history is that these [arguments] tend to rest on prejudices and discriminatory stereotypes,” says Mr. Gans, who directs his organization’s Human Rights, Civil Rights, and Citizenship Program.\n\nThe Pentagon says the number of transgender service members is in the low thousands. But one outside study estimates the number might be as high as 15,000, which would make the Department of Defense the largest employer of transgender adults in the U.S., one that has provided gender-transition treatments for active and reserve service members. On Monday, the Department of Veterans Affairs said it would no longer provide hormone therapy to veterans who weren’t already receiving such treatment.\n\nIn his executive action, Mr. Trump states that adopting a transgender identity “conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life.”\n\nThe action essentially says: “You’re an outsider to a really basic part of being a citizen, which is defending your country,” says Mr. Gans. This type of language “puts a brand on you.”","summary":"Actions by the Trump administration have been pushing back on transgender inclusion, amid sharp public divides and emotional debates over things like women’s sports and care for children.","url":"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2025/0319/transgender-treatment-rights-sports-trump-democrats?icid=rss","image":"https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2025/02/NTRANS%20LEDE%20flag.jpg?alias=standard_900x600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 09:00:13","author":"Simon Montlake","authors":["Simon Montlake"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.107},{"id":301764482,"title":"Musk reveals shocking new plot against him and Tesla: ‘This is unlike anything I’ve ever seen’","text":"Elon Musk has spoken out about an alleged conspiracy to assassinate him and destroy Tesla, the electric car company that has made him the richest man in the world.\n\nThe head of the Department of Government Efficiency and informal adviser to President Donald Trump has had a difficult few weeks as he continues his mission to dramatically reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy.\n\nSpeaking on Fox News Tuesday night, Musk told Sean Hannity that his attempts to cut government waste and fraud is the reason why certain characters ‘want to kill me.’\n\n‘It turns out when you take away people’s, you know, the money that they’re receiving fraudulently, they get very upset,’ he said. \n\n‘And they basically want kill me because I’m stopping their fraud and they want to hurt Tesla because we’re stopping the terrible waste and corruption in the government. And, well, I guess they’re bad people. Bad people do bad things.’\n\nMusk repeated the claim made by many conservative lawmakers, including Marjorie Taylor Greene, that there could be left-wing groups coordinating the protests and attacks on Tesla vehicles and dealerships.\n\n‘I think there are larger forces at work as well,’ Musk said. ‘I mean, who’s funding and who’s coordinating it? Because this is crazy. I’ve never seen anything like this.\n\n‘Tesla is a peaceful company, we’ve never done anything harmful. I’ve never done anything harmful, I’ve only done productive things, so I think we just have a deranged… I think there’s some kind of mental illness going on here,’ he added.\n\nLarge demonstrations have been staged at Tesla dealerships all over the country and in some more extreme incidents, Tesla vehicles owned by innocent people have been set on fire.\n\nThe most recent example came Tuesday morning, when an arsonist used Molotov cocktails to fire bomb five Teslas before firing rounds into the burning vehicles at a dealership in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nLast week, roughly 250 activists gathered outside a showroom in New York City, holding anti-Musk placards that read ‘Block Fascism Now and ‘Musk Must Go’ as they shouted ‘Elon Musk is not elected! Democracy must be protected!’\n\nThe chaos and anger directed at Musk and Tesla have swelled to the point that Trump came out and declared it domestic terrorism.\n\n‘They’re harming a great American company,’ Trump said at the White House, referring to the demonstrators. ‘Let me tell you, you do it to Tesla, and you do it to any company, we’re going to catch you, and… you’re going to go through hell.’\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi appears to be following through on Trump’s promise, also calling the attacks on Tesla property ‘domestic terrorism’ in a statement Tuesday evening.\n\n‘The Department of Justice has already charged several perpetrators with that in mind, including in cases that involve charges with five-year mandatory minimum sentences,’ Bondi said.\n\n‘We will continue investigations that impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.’\n\nLong before the protests at Tesla dealerships began in mid-February, Musk has been feeling significant pain in his wallet. \n\nTesla stock is down more than 53 percent since its peak in mid-December, roughly a month before Trump took office. According to one estimate, SpaceX has now replaced Tesla as Musk’s most valuable asset.\n\nMusk has seen his wealth shrink by $130 billion since January 1, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index. \n\nTesla nearly doubled in value after Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the November election, with investors hoping that Musk’s unique level of access to the incoming president would be a boon to the company.\n\nBut Musk’s massive cuts to various government agencies and job-slashing initiatives within the federal government has not gone over well with some.\n\nFor instance, he spearheaded the closure of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the foreign aid arm of the government that ran food aid, disaster relief and disease prevention programs in over 100 countries on a $40 billion annual budget.\n\nMusk has called USAID ‘one of the biggest sources of fraud.’ \n\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge declared the Trump administration and Musk’s dismantling of USAID likely violated the Constitution.\n\nMusk’s DOGE has also helped to de-fang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education, an agency Trump reportedly wants to shut down via executive order.\n\nMusk’s decision to wholeheartedly join the MAGA movement may have cost him a once-loyal customer base who leans left and also wants to drive electric cars.\n\nGenerally, companies try to stay out of politics to maintain the largest share of customers possible. \n\nAnheuser-Busch, the company behind Bud Light, learned this lesson when it briefly partnered with trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney in April 2023. The firm lost as much as $1.4 billion in sales after conservatives boycotted the brand.\n\nA similar situation could be unfolding for Tesla, as new registrations of its vehicles in the US dropped 11 percent in January from a year earlier.\n\nForeign countries are souring on Teslas even more dramatically, particularly in Europe. \n\nData released in early March showed Tesla sales were down 24 percent year over year in the Netherlands, 42 percent in Sweden, 48 percent in both Norway and Denmark, 45 percent in France, 55 percent in Italy, 10 percent in Spain and 53 percent in Portugal.\n\nHowever, sales fell off a cliff in Germany, where 76 percent fewer Tesla vehicles were sold in February when compared to last year.\n\nGermany’s rejection of Tesla came after Musk’s viral moment at the Inauguration where he was seen making a controversial hand gesture.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nElon Musk has spoken out about an alleged conspiracy to assassinate him and&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Musk reveals shocking new plot against him and Tesla: &#8216;This is unlike anything I&#8217;ve ever seen&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/musk-reveals-shocking-new-plot-against-him-and-tesla-this-is-unlike-anything-ive-ever-seen/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/19/05/96339397-0-image-m-52_1742362829665.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 08:14:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.435},{"id":301792014,"title":"Clarence Page: Trump’s ethnic labeling dilemma","text":"Amid the blizzard of breaking news, a familiar irritation poked through: ethnic labeling.\n\nThe issue unexpectedly emerged this week while the Senate considered a stopgap federal funding bill to keep the federal government running and avoid a possible shutdown,\n\nAfter Trump said Democrats would be blamed and taxes would surge if Democrats didn’t vote for the bill, he suddenly lashed out at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, in an Oval Office meeting Wednesday.\n\n“Schumer is a Palestinian, as far as I’m concerned. He’s become a Palestinian,” Trump said. “He used to be Jewish. He’s not Jewish anymore. He’s a Palestinian.”\n\nSay what? Where did that come from?\n\nSure, like anyone else who has been following this president very closely, I was shocked but sadly not surprised.\n\nHad Trump run out of things to say about the budget and taxes when a thought about the Middle East suddenly came to mind, sending him wandering away from the issues at hand?\n\nUnfortunately, this is hardly the first instance of Trump questioning a political critic’s ethnic or racial identity. As you may recall, his comments last week echoed his whoppers about then-Democratic vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris in 2020 and about Barack Obama during his presidency. Trump saw fit to question whether Obama and Harris were even natural born American citizens.\n\nIn July 2024, during an interview at the National Association of Black Journalists conference, Trump falsely asserted that Harris had not identified before as both Black and Indian.\n\n“I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now, she wants to be known as Black. So, I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” Trump said during the NABJ interview.\n\nSuddenly Trump took a topic that is so vexing for many that they try to avoid it, and turned it into a topic he could try to hide behind.\n\nTrump’s campaign spokesperson eventually acknowledged Harris is a Black woman and cited donations that Trump had made to her earlier campaigns as evidence that he is not racist.\n\nBut not everyone is easily convinced. For example, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a leading Muslim civil rights group, was among the first to express outrage that he called Schumer a Palestinian, calling Trump’s poisonous words beneath the dignity of his office — and, I would add, beneath the credibility of the chief executive in our “land of the free” and “home of the brave.”\n\nCAIR called Trump’s use of “Palestinian” to describe Schumer a racial slur.\n\nThat’s what it sounds like to me. Trump’s feigned confusion over Harris’ Black and Indian heritage and his belittling of Schumer as somehow not Jewish adds up to the same ploy: Trump gets to decide whose identity is authentic and whose is fake.\n\nI’m not the world’s biggest defender of DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) programs, and I believe they have so many well-known shortcomings. But it’s ironic that Trump’s critique comes from an administration that has waged a vigorous crusade against the programs without doing much to help our diverse population learn more about how to get along with each other.\n\nWhy, I often wonder, do the people who really need some DEI coaching seem to be the last to receive it?\n\nOr when they receive it, there’s no guarantee their teacher or coach knows how to teach it without making their students or trainees feel so defensive they just want to run and hide.\n\nYet in a country as diverse as ours we could all benefit from hearing each other’s stories — on both sides of ethnic and racial conflicts.\n\nConsidering how durable the barriers to peaceful reconciliation can be, it is not surprising that racial and ethnic misunderstandings persist, despite the guidance of our better angels.\n\nBut we shouldn’t be surprised to see some politicians play our divisions and suspicions against each other. The best we can do is avoid those people or programs that aim to play us against each other, tribe against tribe, so we can find ways to work together.\n\nThat’s what made America really great.","summary":"The president's recent labeling of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as a Palestinian continues a troubling pattern.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/03/19/clarence-page-trumps-ethnic-labeling-dilemma/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/Clarence-Page-1742230616.jpg?w=822","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 08:00:10","author":"Clarence Page","authors":["Clarence Page"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.107},{"id":301797078,"title":"Who Is Government? by Michael Lewis review – what Doge is trying to destroy","text":"It is a tad obnoxious for Michael Lewis, perhaps America’s most consistently successful nonfiction author, to open his new book by boasting that a previous one sold half a million copies, but bear with him. The book in question was 2018’s The Fifth Risk, in which Lewis smartly responded to Donald Trump’s first administration with profiles of a handful of unknown federal government employees in order to valorise what Trump scorned and highlight the cost of breaking it. His point in the introduction to Who Is Government? is that you could lift the lid on any department and find a similar treasure trove of stories: people you’ve never heard of, doing work whose importance you’ve never understood.\n\nLast year, Lewis assembled a crack team of long-form writers to uncover more of these stories for the Washington Post, and those articles are collected here. The gods have yet again smiled on him, if not his country, because the timing is horrendously perfect. One of the many people who doesn’t understand how the US government works has somehow been permitted to take it down to the studs in the name of “efficiency”. Elon Musk’s Doge has only been running for a few weeks but Americans will be suffering the consequences of his ignorant vandalism for many years to come, in health, national security, disaster preparation and more. It would not be surprising to learn that some of the people interviewed here have already been laid off, or their work defunded. At any rate, Musk’s demolition derby makes this kind of journalism feel, more than ever, like a civic duty.\n\nContrary to the conservative stereotype of a ballooning bureaucracy, the size of the federal workforce has not changed greatly since the 1960s. It currently numbers around 2.4m people, more than 70% of whom work for agencies related to defence and national security. No doubt some of them are mediocre or incompetent, and some systems are badly in need of reform, but this book rightly focuses on the quiet heroes who represent public service at its best.\n\nOne reason we don’t know who these people are is that they don’t care if you know who they are. “The best thing in the world is when no one can remember whose idea it was,” says Ronald E Waters, the humble powerhouse whose National Cemetery Administration has a record rating of 97 on the Customer Satisfaction Index. As the New Yorker’s Casey Cep writes: “He refuses to believe there’s anything like a Ron Fan Club, no matter how many members I find.” Visiting Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Dave Eggers notices “a relentless emphasis on teams and groups and predecessors” rather than individual glory.\n\nEach chapter has its own distinct flavour. Novelist Geraldine Brooks’s story of an IRS cybercrime specialist who teaches jiu-jitsu when he’s not thwarting drug dealers, terrorists and paedophiles could be a movie pitch, while historian Sarah Vowell’s exquisitely written tour of the National Archives intertwines US history with that of her own family: “I was looking for a country I want to live in.”\n\nJohn Lanchester tweaks the assignment by profiling not a person but a number: the consumer price index. He deftly explains how it works and how it falls short. Food prices constitute just 8% of the CPI but they are the main cause of sticker shock, so inflation can be technically falling but, as Joe Biden and Kamala Harris could tell you, consumers won’t feel it. But that does not make CPI, as rightwing agitators claim, a lie. Lanchester’s seemingly wonkish article ascends towards a stirring defence of the pursuit of objective data, however imperfect, as an expression of Enlightenment values.\n\nLewis bookends Who Is Government? with two typically gripping stories that illustrate the limits of free market solutions. Christopher Mark, a former coal miner who revolutionised mine safety at the Department of Labor, discovered that mine operators declined to implement simple life-saving measures in order to cut costs. It took regulation, often demonised as “red tape”, to force their hand. Heather Stone, an epidemiologist at the Food and Drug Administration, investigates deadly diseases so rare that the pharmaceutical industry sees no profit in developing treatments. Put bluntly, the private sector will let people die.\n\nIt does pay better though. Doge’s voluntary redundancy offer perversely incentivises the most accomplished civil servants to triple their salaries by leaving and the less impressive to stay. For everyone in this book, public service is a higher calling. It is also meant to transcend partisan politics. “There’s no Republican or Democratic way to bury a veteran,” says Ron Waters.\n\nDoge’s mercenary, hyperpoliticised agenda is antithetical to these civic values. “Move fast and break things” might work at a startup but it is a catastrophic approach to complex public institutions that have built up over decades. Musk sees federal employees as either time-serving hacks burning through taxpayer dollars or subversive enemies within. Unfortunately, civil servants’ admirable humility allows such caricatures to proliferate. “The typecasting has always been lazy and stupid, but increasingly, it’s deadly,” Lewis writes. This eye-opening, multifaceted ode to public service therefore feels both urgent and moving.","summary":"The Moneyball author is joined by writers including Dave Eggers and Geraldine Brooks in a hymn of praise to the workers who keep America’s cogs turning\n\nIt is a tad obnoxious for Michael Lewis, perhaps America’s most consistently successful nonfiction author, to open his new book by boasting that a previous one sold half a million copies, but bear with him.

And even though they couldn’t bring themselves to vote for a Republican, a lot of them stayed home.\n\n‘But basically, their complaints were very similar to those of Biden voters who flipped to Trump,’ Schor said. \n\nMeanwhile, those who were the least politically engaged swung largely against Democrats.\n\nThose politically disengaged voters went from being a roughly neutral group in 2020 to favoring the Republicans by about 15 points in 2024, Blue Rose Research Found.\n\nThat same group, though, overwhelmingly favored Democrats during the Obama-era.\n\n‘But we’re now at a point where the more people vote, the better Republicans do,’ Schor said.\n\nHe also noted that Harris performed just as well as the 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton did among white conservatives, white liberals and white moderates.\n\nAmong the Hispanic and Asian voters, though, there were double-digit declines.\n\nSchor attributed that decline to the Democratic party focusing on ideological issues, while voters were focusing on economic issues.\n\n‘I really cannot stress how much people cared about the cost of living,’ he said.\n\n‘If you ask what’s more important, the cost of living or some other issue picked at random, people picked the cost of living 91 percent of the time. It’s really hard to get 91 percent of people to click on anything in a survey,’ Schor noted.\n\n‘After the cost of living, it was the size and scope of the federal government, the budget deficit, immigration, crime and also health care. And people trusted Republicans on these issues by double-digits – except for health care, where we had a two-point advantage, which was much lower than our traditional advantage on that issue. \n\n‘The reality is that, to the extent that Democrats try to polarize the electorate on self-descried ideology, this is just something that plays into the hands of Republicans,’ the analyst concluded.\n\nHarris, who only entered the presidential race after former President Joe Biden declared he would not seek re-election, lost in a historic fashion to Trump – including in all seven swing states.\n\nEven in the states that were called blue, the Republican saw a groundswell of popularity that carried him to a decisive victory in what polls suggested would be one of the closest races in history.\n\nTrump received more than 2.5 million votes than he did in 2020 and gained ground in all of the 50 states, while Harris saw a decline of seven million votes from President Joe Biden’s total in his 2020 win.\n\nThe Democratic Party’s favorability has now hit a record low at just 29 percent, a recent CNN poll found. \n\nThat figure marks a 20 point drop in approval since Trump left office more than four years ago at which time approval of the Democratic party was 49 percent. \n\nIt is also a ten point drop from just before the November election.\n\nA new NBC News poll released Sunday similarly found only 27 percent of voters had a positive view of the Democratic Party. That was the lowest positive rating in NBC News polling history dating back to 1990. \n\nThe record low approval of the Democratic Party has been driven by increased dissatisfaction from within, the CNN polling found.\n\nJust 63 percent of Democrats or Democratic-leaning Independents had a favorable view of their own party, a drop from the 72 who had a favorable view of their party in January and 81 percent when President Biden took office. \n\nDemocrats are also torn over the direction of their party should take, the polling found. \n\nAmong Democratic-aligned adults, 52 percent said that the party leadership is taking the party in the wrong direction while 48 percent said they are taking the party in the right direction. \n\nAt the same time, a growing number of Democrats want the party leadership to do more to stop the Republican agenda as Trump barrels through the first two months of his second term. \n\nThe polling found 57 percent believe the party should do more to stop the GOP agenda while just 42 percent believe party leadership should work with Republicans. \n\nCNN noted that is a dramatic shift from Democrats’ views nearly eight years ago. A September 2017 poll from Trump’s first term found 74 percent of Democrats believed their party should try to work with Republicans.\n\nMeanwhile, the favorability of the Republican party among Americans stands at 36 percent including 79 percent approval among Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents. \n\nThe approval of Republicans has remained steady since January and is down just four points from just before the November election. It’s a four point uptick from where GOP favorability stood when Trump left office in 2021.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nEven if every registered voter turned up to the polls in the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8211; Determining the True Election Results with Maximum Voter Turnout first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/determining-the-true-election-results-with-maximum-voter-turnout/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/19/05/96340197-14513819-President_Donald_Trump_was_guaranteed_to_win_the_2024_presidenti-a-48_1742363230501.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-19 07:12:46","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.289},{"id":301748006,"title":"Trump purges Democrats from US Federal Trade Commission","text":"The only two Democrats on the US Federal Trade Commission have been fired by President Donald Trump, the White House said, opening the door for the Republican to appoint loyalists at the independent regulatory agency. .The FTC's primary function is to protect the US public against deceptive or unfair business practices..Speaking on condition of anonymity, a White House official confirmed that FTC commissioners Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter were dismissed..The FTC consists of five commissioners, typically representing both major political parties..\"The president just illegally fired me,\" Bedoya wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter. \"This is corruption plain and simple.\".Bedoya vowed in an X post to \"see the president in court\" over the dismissal..Layoffs of federal workers have been rampant since Trump took office in January and established a \"Department of Government Efficiency\" headed by billionaire Elon Musk, a senior advisor and key financial backer of the Republican's campaign..\"The FTC is an independent agency founded 111 years ago to fight fraudsters and monopolists,\" Bedoya said in a post. \"Now, the president wants the FTC to be a lapdog for his golfing buddies.\".Under Trump and former president Joe Biden, the FTC has taken on Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook parent Meta over how they wield market power..In an interview with Fox Business in February, newly appointed FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson confirmed that ongoing cases against Amazon and Meta would proceed, emphasizing his commitment to \"holding Big Tech's feet to the fire.\".Questions have lingered, however, on whether the Trump presidency will continue with the cases, given an apparent alignment between tech billionaires and the Republican since he won last year's election..Since that victory, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made major changes at his company to bring it in line with Trump's preferences.
