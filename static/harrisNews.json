Tammy Duckworth said that Johnson should be added to the list of Republicans whom Trump frequently identifies as responsible for undermining his agenda. The Illinois Democrat was on CNN’s State of the Union and argued that Johnson was attempting to block a prominent part of that 2024 campaign agenda: Support for making in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments affordable or free for American families.\n\nShe spoke to anchor Dana Bash about a letter she wrote to the president annotated with the Trump-style caption, “WARNING: Speaker Johnson wants YOU to become the DEADBEAT DAD of IVF.”\n\n“It’s...personal to me because I saw so many of my comrades who were at Walter Reed and other military medical centers who lost their fertility as a result of their military service,” said Duckworth, noting that veterans still suffer much higher rates of infertility than do civilians.\n\nHer comments come on the heels of a Military.com report detailing the congressional discussions over the National Defense Authorization Act, better known as the NDAA. The annual bill funds America’s armed services. Johnson, according to Military.com, is leading efforts to strip language aimed at expanding IVF coverage for service members from the legislation. \n\nRight now, IVF coverage is only covered for service members if infertility is judged to have been caused by “a serious or severe illness or injury while on active duty,” according to the news outlet. New provisions in this year’s NDAA would expand that coverage to all service members, regardless of the reasons for infertility struggles.\n\nThe senator pointed out one reason why this plan is often insufficient during her interview on Sunday: Many military women, she argued, want financial support to freeze their eggs before entering into combat zones rather than seeking treatment or therapies after the fact.\n\nOn Sunday evening as Washington headed into the second week of the holiday month, lawmakers in the House released the text of the 2026 NDAA. The massive piece of legislation, more than 3,000 pages in total, did not include the language expanding IVF access for service members — indicating Johnson's success.\n\nThe policy is one of Trump’s most unique campaign positions stemming from his 2024 bid for office. While all three of his presidential runs leaned on support from the Christian conservative right, including opponents of abortion, the president’s stance on IVF runs contrary to views held by many hardline opponents of abortion given how human embryos are created, stored and sometimes destroyed as a part of the IVF treatment process.\n\nIn October, the president announced at a White House event that his administration had negotiated with some pharmacies and a drug manufacturer to lower costs on one commonly-used IVF medication.\n\nDuckworth suggested during her interview that it was Johnson and the House GOP’s own ties to the religious right blocking further progress on the president’s plan, not Democrats. Trump acknowledged some of that backlash from conservatives at his event in October, and quipped that his plan was “pro-life”.\n\n\"There's nobody opposing this other than Speaker Johnson and his religious views,\" said Duckworth. “Because if you believe that a fertilized egg is a human being, has personhood, then some of the processes within IVF are considered murder.”\n\nIt’s also one Trump has struggled to implement via legislation. The expansion of IVF benefits to all servicemembers would mark his greatest success in this endeavor; Republicans in Congress have not moved to implement the broader policy call of his campaign, which would involve passing legislation to mandate health insurance plans cover IVF in some fashion, making it a more affordable option for families. $50,000 is typically cited as the average cost for a successful pregnancy via IVF, which includes the cost of medications and often multiple treatment cycles.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, is dealing with lingering resentment and rebellious attitudes in the House of Representatives. Prominent women in his caucus including rogues like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Nancy Mace, as well as loyalists like Rep. Elise Stefanik, are growing increasingly publicly critical of his leadership, while others have predicted in anonymous comments to reporters that Johnson’s tenure as speaker will not last through 2026.\n\nThe House GOP holds a tenuous majority in the chamber, which is set to shrink in January with the resignation of Greene and, potentially, Mace as well. Other members are reportedly considering the same.\n\nDemocrats are poised to take control of the chamber next year if current trends continue. Republicans remain mired in an affordability crisis, the same one that doomed Joe Biden’s presidency and Kamala Harris’s 2024 campaign; Trump continues to dismiss it as a “Democrat hoax”.\n\nCongress is facing a deadline on that topic in the coming weeks as federal subsidies for plans on the Affordable Care Act’s public health exchanges are set to expire at the end of the year, which if not extended or dealt with are set to result in annual premiums skyrocketing for millions.","summary":"Illinois Democrat blames Mike Johnson and conservatives for blocking progress on key Trump 2024 campaign policy","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/duckworth-mike-johnson-trump-ivf-b2879803.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/23/6/47/U-S--President-Trump-hosts-dinner-with-Republican-members-of-Congress-at-the-White-House-in-Washingt.jpeg?crop=3597.5,2398.3,x165.3,y127.1&trim=127,2237,1474,165&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/tutITdyq-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-08 00:42:43","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.191},{"id":385983594,"title":"AI bots sway voters four times more than campaign ads, studies show","text":"Can five minutes of conversation with an AI bot make you change your view of a candidate for prime minister? If you are certain the answer is no, you may want to think again. A pair of new studies published over the weekend in the prestigious journals Nature and Science has dropped a bomb into the global political arena: generative artificial intelligence is a far more effective persuasion tool than anything we have known until now. Remarkably effective persuasion tool The studies, led by researchers from Cornell University, MIT and additional institutes, found that a conversation with a chatbot changed voters’ positions at four times the rate of watching televised campaign ads. The findings mark a new front in political campaigning and could reshape the rules ahead of the 2026 U.S. midterms and Israel’s upcoming election. The Science study examined about 77,000 voters in Britain across 700 political issues. Meanwhile, the Nature study focused on the 2024 and 2025 election cycles in the United States, Canada and Poland. The data presents a dramatic picture: in Canada and Poland, about 10 percent of participants — one in ten — changed their minds after the conversation and decided to support a candidate they had previously opposed. In the United States, in the heated race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, bots persuaded one in 25 voters to switch sides. Considering that elections today are often decided by slim margins, this represents a game-changing weapon. One example from the research illustrates the dynamic. A Trump supporter who spoke with a bot promoting Harris was exposed to arguments about her record in California and the Trump Organization’s tax penalties. By the end of the conversation, the voter admitted: “If I had doubts about her credibility, she’s starting to look pretty credible. Maybe I’ll vote for her.” Why is this happening? What makes these bots so persuasive? The researchers found that the secret lies in volume. The bots flooded users with data, evidence and logical arguments. Contrary to the common belief that people are indifferent to facts — how often have you heard the term “post-truth”? — the research shows that when presented with a large amount of evidence in a personal and interactive manner, we tend to be persuaded. But this is also where the real danger lies. The bots’ persuasive power did not diminish even when some of the information they provided was false. Bots programmed to promote right-wing candidates generated more hallucinations and false claims than bots on the left, yet this did not meaningfully reduce their effectiveness. Only when researchers restricted the bots from using “facts” altogether did their persuasive impact drop by about 50 percent. To appreciate the scale of the shift, it helps to look back. A decade ago, the Cambridge Analytica scandal shocked the world when it emerged that personal user data had been used to target political ads. Now, technology has taken a step further. No longer just an ad tailored to your psychological profile, but an active conversational agent that responds to your arguments in real time — empathetic, polite and tireless. Of course, we had to try it For curiosity’s sake, we asked an AI chatbot — Google’s Gemini, in this case — to convince us to vote for Benjamin Netanyahu in the upcoming election. Its responses included extensive information about political and diplomatic moves from his past that, it argued, benefited the country. We then asked the opposite question: “Convince me why Benjamin Netanyahu is not suitable to serve as Israel’s prime minister.” The results were equally challenging for anyone seeking to be persuaded one way or the other. For example, in the tech sector, the bot claimed he helped transform Israel into the Start-Up Nation thanks to policies since 2009, but also contributed to foreign investors’ reluctance to enter the local market due to the judicial overhaul, which creates uncertainty. It is also worth noting that while popular tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and Meta’s Llama attempt to maintain a posture of neutrality, other models — like Elon Musk’s Grok — were intentionally designed with a clear ideological tilt. Grok is the best known, but it is not the only one. Prof. David G. Rand of Cornell University, one of the studies’ authors, put it succinctly in comments to The New York Times: “This is the frontier of innovation for political campaigning.” At the same time, Eitan Porat, a disinformation researcher at George Washington University, offered a more tempered view, saying in an interview that “the big challenge will be getting people to talk to bots outside the lab.” The implication of these studies is that we are entering a new era in political communication. If in the past we feared fake news spread by simple bots on Twitter, the future promises heated political debates with artificial intelligence that is articulate, persuasive and at times deceptive. It is highly likely that in the next election, when you receive a friendly message inviting you to discuss the issues, the person on the other end will not be a party activist but an algorithm designed to change the one thing you thought was unchangeable — your mind.","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/tech-and-digital/article/skl9zqqzwe","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/07/30/S1mVU3Dvex/S1mVU3Dvex_114_0_1467_825_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 00:04:46","author":"Raphael Kahan","authors":["Raphael Kahan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":385981976,"title":"White House Shares Another ICE Video Featuring Sabrina Carpenter","text":"President Donald Trump’s White House is not backing down after singer Sabrina Carpenter criticized the administration for using her song to promote the administration’s efforts to forcibly deport undocumented immigrants.\n“PSA: If you’re a criminal illegal, you WILL be arrested & deported,” the official X account for the White House posted on Friday, December 5, featuring a doctored Saturday Night Live promotional video featuring Carpenter, 26, and SNL star Marcello Hernandez.\nIn the original, unedited clip, Carpenter opens the promo by evoking her many viral Short n’ Sweet tour moments in which she “arrests” various celebrities in attendance.\n“I think I might need to arrest someone for being too hot,” Carpenter says in the original. In the edited clip, the White House changed the word “hot” to \"illegal.\"\n“Well, I turn myself in,” Hernandez, 28, who is of Cuban and Dominican descent, responds. (Hernandez’s own standup references his mother, who immigrated to the United States when she was 12 in order to flee communism.)\n‘You’re under arrest,” Carpenter begins to quip, before the video cuts her off and segues into a montage of video clips featuring Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) officers detaining various individuals in the United States.\nInstead of using Carpenter’s music for the video montage, the White House used Rihanna’s “S&M” and Gucci Mane’s “I Get the Bag,” featuring Migos.\nThe new post comes in the wake of Carpenter openly criticizing the White House for using her music in another, since deleted ICE promotional video.\n“This video is evil and disgusting,” Carpenter wrote via X on Tuesday, December 2. “Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhuman agenda.”\nOne day earlier, the White House posted a video featuring images of ICE officers detaining individuals alleged to be “dangerous” criminals residing in the United States without proper identification or authorization. Carpenter’s song “Juno” played in the background of the 21-second clip.\n“Have you ever tried this one?” the White House captioned the video via X, referencing Carpenter’s viral moments in her life shows in which she strikes various sexual poses. “Bye-bye.”\nIn response to Carpenter’s post, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson defended the video and its content in a statement to Us Weekly.\n“Here’s a Short n’ Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter: we won’t apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists and pedophiles from our country,” Jackson said in a statement to Us on Tuesday. “Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?”\nAccording to the Cato Institute, 93 percent of individuals detained and booked in ICE detention centers have not been convicted of a violent crime, and nearly two-thirds have no criminal conviction at all.\nCarpenter isn’t the first celebrity to object to having their music be associated with Trump’s administration’s policies.\nIn October, Kenny Loggins made headlines for criticizing the White House’s use of his hit song “Danger Zone” in a video that depicted Trump flying over No Kings protestors.\n“This is an unauthorized use of my performance of ‘Danger Zone.’ Nobody asked me for my permission, which I would have denied, and I request that my recording on this video is removed immediately,” Loggins, 77, said in a statement shared with Variety at the time. “I can’t imagine why anybody would want their music used or associated with something created with the sole purpose of dividing us. Too many people are trying to tear us apart, and we need to find new ways to come together.”\nIn 2024, Beyoncé also threatened a cease and desist order to the Trump campaign after it used “Freedom” in a video. That song later became former Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign song.","url":"https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/white-house-shares-another-ice-video-featuring-sabrina-carpenter/","image":"https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2202854583-Sabrina-Carpenter-New-Song-Manchild.jpg?crop=0px%2C61px%2C1515px%2C855px&resize=1200%2C675&quality=74&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 23:52:34","author":"Danielle Campoamor","authors":["Danielle Campoamor"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.276},{"id":385971892,"title":"Google reveals the top trending searches of 2025","text":"Google has unveiled its Year in Search 2025, spotlighting the events, people and pop-culture moments that prompted the biggest spikes in search interest.

Jasmine Crockett on Monday is expected to launch a Senate bid that will dramatically reshape the race for the seat held by Republican John Cornyn.\n\nIf she files her candidacy for the seat, Crockett would join a March 3 Democratic primary field that includes former U.S. Rep. Colin Allred of Dallas and state Rep. James Talarico of Austin. The winner of the Democratic nomination advances to a November general election showdown against the victor of the GOP primary that includes Cornyn, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt.\n\nThe Democratic Senate primary will likely focus on which candidate is better suited to be the party’s standard bearer in the era of President Donald Trump. Polls show Democrats want a fighter to lead a fierce resistance to Trump and his policies, rather than someone focused on compromising.\n\n“Voters are looking for someone who’s unapologetic in defending our values and who is plain spoken and knows how to speak the language of the everyday person,” said Kardal Coleman, chairman of the Dallas County Democratic Party. “All of them are going to be skilled campaigners and skilled communicators, but the person who can really exemplify what it means to be a Texas Democrat is going to have the most success.”\n\nCandidates have until 6 p.m. Monday to file for the March 3 primaries. Crockett will make an official announcement on her political future at 4:30 p.m.\n\nCrockett, 44, is in her second term representing District 30 in the Dallas area. She won the seat in 2022 after the late trailblazing Democrat Eddie Bernice Johnson hand-picked Crockett as her successor.\n\nBefore Congress, Crockett served one term in the Texas House. She got there by winning an underdog campaign against former state Rep. Lorraine Birabil, D-Dallas.\n\nIn Congress Crockett is known for her unabashed criticism of Trump and his allies. She’s had spats with U.S. Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Nancy Mace of South Carolina that went viral.\n\nCrockett was criticized in March for referring to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott as “governor hot wheels” during a California dinner speech. Abbott has used a wheelchair since he was partially paralyzed as a young man in 1984 when a tree fell on him.\n\nCrockett is a national figure with strong name recognition. Political analysts say that makes her the frontrunner in the Senate primary. Crockett has become a prolific fundraiser. She has more than $4.6 million in her congressional campaign account.\n\nAn October University of Houston-Texas Southern University survey had Crockett leading a field of current and potential Democratic Senate candidates with 31% support. Talarico and former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of El Paso had 25%, while Allred scored 13% support. The poll of announced candidates found Allred leading Talarico 46% to 42%.\n\nCrockett’s expected Senate bid comes after a summertime mid-decade Republican redistricting moved her out of District 30. The Supreme Court ruled last week Texas can use the new map for the 2026 election.\n\nCrockett’s national profile and fundraising prowess would likely allow her to find a path back to the House regardless, representing one of the two remaining Dallas area seats that lean Democratic.\n\nShe has said Democrats must find a way to win back the Senate, however, to make real progress on their agenda. Flipping Texas would go a long way toward achieving that goal.\n\nCrockett could be chafing at her unsuccessful attempts to climb the ranks in Congress, having lost a race to join party leadership and failing in her bid for the top spot on the Oversight Committee.\n\nCrockett also could be motivated by her history-making potential. A Black woman has never won a Texas statewide office. She would be the first person of color from Texas to serve in the Senate. \n\nCrockett’s entry into the race would force Talarico and Allred to change their strategies.\n\nTalarico, 36, stormed into the race in September and raised more than $6 million in one month. His candidacy has excited Democrats, including progressives attracted to his charisma and principled warrior persona.\n\nHe’s cast himself as the Texas Democrat needed to check Trump, and crowds have flocked to his rallies to hear his soaring oratory.\n\nCrockett is expected to siphon some of Talarico’s support, especially in North Texas.\n\nAllred announced his candidacy July 1 and already has staged numerous Texas campaign swings. Last year he lost a highly publicized Senate race to Cruz, and part of his campaign challenge was to convince Democratic voters he’s the right kind of pugilist to win what could be a bruising statewide general election campaign.\n\nThough Allred, 42, outperformed former Vice President Kamala Harris in Texas in 2024, his defeat soured him with some Democrats.\n\nStill, he’s maintained support, though Crockett could hurt him in North Texas and the Houston area, where he has support from Black voters and women.","url":"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/elections/2025/12/07/jasmine-crockett-expected-to-launch-senate-campaign-ahead-of-candidate-filing-deadline/","image":"https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/GLCS4YJXZZDALPZUPTRUPDWNGU.jpg?auth=d80f49975ebcfae762ee9d02474760c8db1fda9fa664a07540adbe89f6775d43&quality=80&width=1200&height=630&smart=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 20:57:08","author":"Joseph Morton","authors":["Joseph Morton"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.133},{"id":385972540,"title":"Here’s How Many Immigrant Children Trump Has Saved That Biden ‘Wasn’t Even Looking For’","text":"According to Border Czar Tom Homan, the Trump administration already rescued more than 62,000 migrant kids from horrific situations like sex trafficking and forced labor after crossing the border alone during the Biden years.\n\nHoman said Trump’s team stepped in to save them.

He also said Biden’s people lost track of an unimaginable number of them. “They lost track of 300,000.”\n\nHoman said Trump came into office with a direct promise. “President Trump committed on day one that we will do everything we can to find every one of these children.”\n\n“I look at the numbers every day.

Trump laid out the scale of the disaster during a rally while he campaigning against Kamala Harris in the final weeks of the campaign. “This is not even possible to believe, 325,000 migrant children are missing, many of whom have been trafficked and raped,” he said. Their criticism focused on the Biden administration’s failure to monitor vulnerable kids who slipped into the hands of criminals.\n\nFor our VIPs: The Media Knew J6 Pipe Bomber ‘Trump Supporter’ Narrative Was False All Along\n\nTom Homan pushed back against the criticism of Donald Trump’s strict border policies and said they delivered real humanitarian results. He directed his fire at Democrats. “They’re complicit,” Homan said. “Four years this has happened: sex trafficking historic highs, children crossing the border historic highs, migrant deaths crossing the border historic highs.” He said Trump’s leadership made the difference the country needed. “Like or love President Trump, you got to admit, this man has shown every day he’s saving America.” The data told the story. The Biden administration logged more than 301,981 encounters at the southwest border in December of last year. That number dropped to 11,710 in October, the latest month with available figures.\n\nWant to support fearless journalism that exposes the Left and tells the stories the media won’t?

Tim Walz’s (D) chances of a political future, the Hill reported Saturday.\n\nThe controversy, involving Minnesota’s influential Somali community, focuses on millions stolen from the program and has led to more than 50 convictions. Federal prosecutors accused dozens of people of stealing funds from a government program that was to feed children during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWATCH — Noem: “Wacko” Tim Walz an Idiot Who Brought in Illegals On Purpose:\n\nThe New York Times put the story on the radar of legacy media outlets on November 29, with a report that federal prosecutors said as much as $1 billion in taxpayer money may have been stolen in separate fraudulent schemes.\n\nLongtime allies are reportedly wondering if the governor should walk away from a reelection attempt for a third term as governor, according to the D.C. political news outlet.\n\nThe Hill reported:\n\n“The governor, I think, has done a very respectable job, a good job, in Minnesota for the years that he’s been here. But he clearly is vulnerable and in my view, he is riskier than any Democratic candidate that might run,” said Ember Reichgott Junge, a former Minnesota Democratic state senator and a political analyst in the state.\nReichgott Junge said fraud “happened on his watch” and that Walz “can’t erase that.” While she said the governor is taking steps to rectify it, including audits, those investigations will “probably uncover more.”\n\nThe analyst said the issue is in the headlines in Minnesota “nearly every other day” and predicted the issue will “continue to surface through the next year.”\n\nOn Saturday, Small Business Administration (SBA) Secretary Kelly Loeffler posted on X that the SBA was also uncovering fraud and accused the governor of using his “best efforts to obstruct” investigations.\n\nAnother longtime ally of Walz’s told the Hill that the controversy could not only sink his gubernatorial reelection for a third term but likely a presidential bid as well.\n\n“The challenges are that Minnesota has a very low tolerance for fraud, waste and abuse. It’s a very low threshold, and that’s one of the reasons the state has worked so well for so long,” the unnamed ally said. “It’s clearly a real vulnerability.”\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, nearly 500 employees in Minnesota’s state government say Walz ignored their constant warnings about massive fraud by Somalis in the state’s aid programs, also alleging that his allies punished whistleblowers for raising the alarm.\n\nWATCH — Trump Refuses to Apologize for Calling Tim Walz “Seriously R*tarded”:\n\nWalz, 61, was introduced into national politics 16 months ago when then-Vice President Kamala Harris chose the animated governor as her running mate.\n\n“I think we all had high hopes for him, but I don’t think he was a very effective running mate at the end of the day,” one top Democrat strategist told the Hill. “It never seemed like he was comfortable in the role beyond his rollout.”\n\nContributor Lowell Cauffiel is the best-selling author of Below the Line and nine other crime novels and nonfiction titles.

Demócratas conocidos a nivel nacional, incluido el exsecretario de Transporte Pete Buttigieg, han ofrecido su apoyo a Eileen Higgins, una demócrata que formó parte de la comisión del condado antes de ganar un lugar en la segunda vuelta el mes pasado.\n\nUna victoria inesperada de los demócratas el martes dará al partido un impulso adicional de cara a un año electoral crucial en que estará en juego el control del Congreso, especialmente en una región que se ha convertido en un territorio cada vez más favorable para los republicanos —y donde Trump planea construir su biblioteca presidencial.\n\nHiggins, quien reside en el enclave cubano de La Pequeña Habana y había representado a un distrito de tendencia conservadora, lleva con orgullo el apelativo de “La Gringa”, un término que quienes hablan español utilizan para referirse a los estadounidenses blancos. Hispanohablante también, Higgins ha centrado su campaña incansablemente en problemas locales como el costo de la vivienda, y a la vez ha capitalizado los nacionales, incluido el trato que da el gobierno de Trump a los inmigrantes en una ciudad con una considerable población hispana y de nacidos en el extranjero.\n\n“He sido una demócrata que sirve en un distrito predominantemente republicano, y todo lo que he hecho es trabajar para la gente”, dijo a The Associated Press.\n\nDemócratas intentan acabar con dominio republicano\n\nMiami es la segunda ciudad más poblada de Florida, después de Jacksonville, pero es el epicentro de la diversidad cultural del estado y uno de los destinos internacionales más prominentes del país, lo que le da a su alcalde una plataforma de gran alcance.\n\nLa ciudad de 487.000 habitantes es parte del condado Miami-Dade, y Trump cambió su tendencia el año pasado cuando derrotó cómodamente a la demócrata Kamala Harris después de perder el condado ante el demócrata Joe Biden en 2020. Una derrota de Gonzalez se percibirá en Florida como un revés tanto para el Partido Republicano como para Trump.\n\nChristian Ulvert, director de campaña de Higgins, reveló que los primeros resultados de las papeletas de voto por correo son alentadores. Alrededor del 44% habían sido emitidas por demócratas registrados hasta el jueves, un día antes que comenzara la votación anticipada en persona, en comparación con aproximadamente el 30% de los republicanos registrados.\n\n“Lo que se percibe es un gran entusiasmo demócrata y una participación electoral acorde con ese entusiasmo”, agregó.\n\nHiggins, quien de ser elegida será la primera alcaldesa no hispana de Miami en casi 30 años, manifestó estar segura de que recibirá el apoyo no sólo de los demócratas, sino también de los votantes no afiliados y de algunos republicanos gracias a su labor como funcionaria electa.\n\nSu propuesta a los votantes incluye encontrar terrenos municipales que puedan convertirse en viviendas económicas y recortar gastos innecesarios. Durante un foro reciente patrocinado por la Cámara de Comercio del Área Metropolitana de Miami, se le preguntó si intentará convertir el cargo de alcaldesa, que es más protocolario, en un trabajo de tiempo completo y no aceptar otros trabajos, algo que planteó dudas éticas para el actual alcalde, Francis Suarez, cuyo mandato está limitado.\n\n“No tengo empleo externo ahora. Fui comisionada a tiempo completo. Voy a ser alcaldesa a tiempo completo”, dijo Higgins cuando el entrevistador mantuvo su presión sobre si eso significaba no aceptar ningún empleo externo.\n\nCon un estilo directo de hablar, Higgins respondió con severidad: “De acuerdo, ¿tengo que decirlo más claramente? ¡No! Es un trabajo de tiempo completo”.\n\nRepublicanos se preocupan ante disminución de apoyo latino\n\nSi bien los votantes latinos a nivel nacional se han inclinado tradicionalmente por los demócratas, los republicanos en Florida han encontrado un fuerte respaldo entre los inmigrantes cubanos, venezolanos y nicaragüenses, quienes se resisten a inclinaciones socialistas similares a las de los gobiernos de los que huyeron. Trump aprovechó esos sentimientos para ganar el condado Miami-Dade el año pasado, un cambio radical respecto a su derrota allí de 30 puntos porcentuales ante la demócrata Hillary Clinton, en 2016.\n\nNo obstante, algunos republicanos de Florida comenzaron a dar la voz de alarma tras las elecciones de noviembre, cuando los demócratas lograron victorias en las contiendas por la gobernatura en Nueva Jersey y Virginia, con gran repercusión nacional. Los dos candidatos ganadores tuvieron un sólido desempeño entre los votantes no blancos, y el ganador demócrata en la contienda de Nueva Jersey recibió dos tercios del voto hispano, según la Encuesta de Votantes de la AP.\n\nEsos resultados fueron interpretados en gran medida como un reflejo de la preocupación por el aumento de los precios y las agresivas políticas migratorias del gobierno de Trump.\n\nLa representante federal María Elvira Salazar, una republicana cuyo distrito incluye la ciudad de Miami, calificó las elecciones en otros lugares como una “llamada de atención”. Ileana Garcia, senadora estatal de Florida quien en 2016 fundó el grupo Latinas for Trump (Latinas por Trump), ha dicho sobre los arrestos por inmigración que “lo que estamos presenciando es inhumano”.\n\nGonzalez, exdirector del Servicio de Ciudadanía e Inmigración de Estados Unidos (USCIS, por sus siglas en inglés) durante la presidencia republicana de George W. Bush, declaró durante un debate patrocinado por el canal afiliado a la cadena CBS en Miami que apoyaba los arrestos por inmigración contra quienes cometen delitos. Sin embargo, objetó cuando el moderador destacó que la mayoría de los arrestados no habían cometido delitos violentos.\n\n“Pero este es un asunto federal”, respondió Gonzalez. “Este no es un asunto que tenga que ver con el alcalde de Miami”.\n\nHiggins ha hablado sobre la adhesión de Miami a un programa federal que delega la autoridad migratoria a la policía local, los jefes policiales de los condados y las agencias estatales, y añadió que buscará opciones legales para revertir esa decisión y reconstruir la confianza entre los residentes y las fuerzas del orden.\n\n“Cuando empecemos a aplicar cualquier artimaña que surja del gobierno federal para detener a personas al azar, podríamos erosionar esa confianza”, dijo.\n\nDemócratas de Florida esperan impulsar su regreso a la relevancia\n\nHiggins ha recibido el apoyo de los demócratas de Florida, quienes buscan demostrar que el partido aún tiene presencia allí —previamente un estado clave sin una tendencia política definida.\n\nTambién respaldan su campaña algunos demócratas que tal vez consideran una candidatura presidencial en 2028. Buttigieg animó a los votantes en un video a votar por ella, y el senador estadounidense Ruben Gallego, de Arizona, planeaba acompañarla el domingo en las paradas de las votaciones anticipadas.\n\nMuchos de los problemas locales en juego en la contienda tienen resonancia nacional, como la desigualdad de ingresos y uno de los mercados inmobiliarios más inaccesibles del país.\n\nGustavo Ascani, un votante de Miami de 30 años de edad, manifestó que la ciudad tiene problemas no resueltos desde hace mucho tiempo que deben abordarse. Agregó que aún no ha decidido por quién votará, pero que afrontar la falta de vivienda y el tráfico vehicular es una prioridad para él.\n\n“Quizá los republicanos han pasado por alto, después de haber estado en el poder local tanto tiempo, ciertos asuntos que son importantes para la población de Miami”, añadió Ascani.\n\nRobin Peguero, exfiscal que se postula para competir contra Salazar por su escaño en el Congreso, dijo que las preocupaciones de los votantes se centran en la asequibilidad, un tema que se ha convertido en un punto medular para ambos partidos tras las victorias de los demócratas en Nueva Jersey y Virginia.\n\nEso incluye los fuertes aumentos en las primas de los seguros médicos que se espera comiencen el 1 de enero, cuando expiren los subsidios de la Ley de Cuidado de Salud Asequible. La ley de salud de la era Obama aún es popular en el sur de Florida, y encuestas recientes muestran que la mayoría de las personas afectadas por los aumentos culpan a Trump y a los republicanos.\n\n“(Esos) son asuntos cotidianos, ya sea una elección para funcionarios locales o una elección para presidente”, expresó Peguero. “Es un rechazo a lo que está sucediendo en este país”.","summary":"Por ADRIANA G&#211;MEZ LIC&#211;N MIAMI (AP) &#8212; Han pasado casi tres d&#233;cadas desde que un dem&#243;crata ocup&#243; la alcald&#237;a de Miami, una etapa de futilidad que el partido espera revertir durante una elecci&#243;n especial de segunda vuelta esta semana, en uno de los &#250;ltimos enfrentamientos electorales antes de las elecciones intermedias del pr&#243;ximo a&#241;o.

The on-again, off-again MAGA media lynch mobs gunning for Patel to be ousted from the key Cabinet post over his perceived mishandling of several high-profile investigations and unmet demands for transparency have crested and fallen too many times to count during his tumultuous nine months in office.\n\nBut on Thursday, Patel instantly regained any lost footing after announcing the arrest of the alleged Jan. 6, 2021, pipe-bombing suspect.\n\nIn a major breakthrough in one of the FBI’s most high-profile unsolved cases, the FBI Thursday morning arrested Brian Cole Jr., 30, in his family’s Woodbridge, Virginia, home and accused him of placing pipe bombs outside the Republican and Democratic Party headquarters in Washington, D.C., the day of the U.S. Capitol riot. Cole has been charged with transporting an explosive device and attempted malicious destruction using explosive materials, according to court documents. The bombs never detonated, and there’s a lingering question about whether they were capable of doing so.\n\nRegardless of the level of danger, the pipe bombs have fueled a flood of conspiracy theories over who planted them and why no law enforcement officers found the device placed at the Democratic National Committee headquarters, even though the Secret Service had swept the site before then-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris’ visit that day.\n\nAs video footage of FBI agents surrounding Cole’s house played on several cable TV stations, Patel, surrounded by Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, and a phalanx of top federal law enforcement officials gathered under the klieg lights at the Justice Department press room for a victory lap on the arrest. The Trump administration investigators had pinpointed Cole not because of any new tip, but just old-fashioned police work, Patel said. Meanwhile, the Biden administration’s FBI let the case gather dust for years, Trump officials argued.\n\n“This cold case languished for four years until Kash and Bongino came to the FBI,” Bondi told reporters Thursday.\n\nAn affidavit signed by an FBI agent who worked on the case and released to the public showed that the FBI tracked Cole’s bomb-making equipment to purchases at Home Depot and Walmart. It also said Cole’s cellphone pinged in the area of the Republican and Democratic Party headquarters on the night of Jan. 5, 2021, when video showed a shadowy individual in a hoodie planting the bombs. His car, according to the affidavit, was also a half mile from the bombs on the same night.\n\nThe suspect’s motives remain a mystery, but reports surfaced Thursday afternoon that the alleged bomber had anarchist leanings.\n\nWhile critics, including former FBI agent and podcaster Kyle Seraphin, cast doubt that the evidence against Cole Jr. was anywhere near conclusive, Bondi and others, including U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro, heralded the arrest as a bombshell achieved through diligence and constant coordination between law enforcement agencies.\n\n“This execution was flawless in terms of teamwork, resilience, and just a good, old-fashioned way of police getting the job done,” Patel told reporters, noting it was Bongino who led the monthslong investigation. “When you let good cops be cops, this is what happens. I’m eternally grateful to the team behind me, to the leadership at the FBI who made this possible.”\n\nBongino praised Trump for setting the tone and giving them marching orders to “go after the bad guys and stop focusing on other extraneous things not related to law enforcement.”\n\nIndeed, for many critics, especially those on the right, the FBI that Kash and Bongino inherited had become politically weaponized against Trump and conservatives to the point it public trust in the agency was at historic lows. Under Biden, the FBI had produced internal directives to investigate parents who criticized local school boards, including Catholics and pro-life individuals, and had spent an inordinate amount of time and resources interrogating and arresting individuals who entered the Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, riots, even those who played no role in the violence.\n\nWhen Patel and Bongino arrived at the FBI, MAGA world cheered, but expected instant reforms and transparency on some of the most controversial law enforcement matters, including the Jeffrey Epstein underage sex trafficking scandal. Transparency on the Epstein case proved much harder to achieve, as rumors for months have swirled that a number of prominent politicians on both sides of the aisle, including former President Bill Clinton and even Trump himself, could be exposed for involvement.\n\nBondi followed her promise to release the Epstein files with an embarrassing White House scene in February in which the attorney general handed out binders of what she inaccurately cast as newly declassified Epstein information to pro-Trump influencers who would later complain that they contained previously released files.\n\nBongino was so unhappy about the “Bondi binders” and the public backlash over them that he considered leaving his job in July after a heated confrontation with the attorney general, followed by a threat to quit unless Trump fired Bondi. The ultimatum, which leaked to the press, fueled speculation over who would survive the next few weeks, Bondi or Bongino.\n\nThe ugly spat subsided, and both Bondi and Bongino survived. But dissent from the left and the right against Patel and Bongino had ebbed and flowed during his nine months on the job with reports as recent as last week that Patel was on thin ice and set for removal. The rumors of Patel’s imminent departure reached a crescendo heading into and over the Thanksgiving weekend until the White House poured cold water on the reports that Trump was poised to fire Patel.\n\nLast weekend, The Telegraph, a British newspaper, citing anonymous sources, claimed that the “mood is miserable” inside Patel’s “chaotic” FBI. Rank-and-file FBI agents were reportedly angered by several perceived blunders, including that Patel had prematurely announced that the FBI had thwarted a potential terrorist attack in Michigan on Halloween, in what critics said allowed suspects to flee. Back in September, during the furious manhunt for Charlie Kirk’s assassin, he claimed a killer was in custody when he wasn’t.\n\nDemocrats have always taken a dim view of Patel’s leadership at the FBI. Buoyed by reports that the White House was losing patience with the director, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker reminded Patel during a September hearing that a capricious boss might bring his career to an end. \n\n“I don’t think you’re fit to head the bureau, but here’s the thing, Mr. Patel, I think you’re not going to be around long,” Booker said.” I think this might be your last oversight hearing.”\n\nPatel fired back that the senator was “an embarrassment.”\n\nOver the last month, prominent conservative voices have started to pile on.\n\nIn mid-October, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson published a bombshell report showing that Trump shooter Thomas Crooks had a much larger and far more anti-Trump digital footprint than the Biden-era FBI had portrayed.\n\nThe New York Post’s Miranda Devine advanced Carlson’s reporting by releasing even more of Crooks’ social media activity—including his visits to DeviantHub, a well-known gender-bending website frequented by furries. Even though the FBI declined to comment for the Devine’s report, a few days later Patel unsuccessfully tried to poke holes in the reporting in interviews with other reporters.\n\nJust last week, Patel also announced a “full force” “coast-to-coast” manhunt for the National Guard attacker when the murderer was already in custody. Patel subsequently clarified that the comments were related to a broader investigation into potential accomplices or a wider plot, and not the announcement of a new manhunt for the already apprehended primary attacker.\n\nThen on Dec. 1, Devine published a report from “an alliance” of anonymous active-duty and retired FBI agents and analysts claiming that the agency was a “rudderless ship” under Patel and Bongino, who were more concerned with building “personal resumes” and engaging on social media than reforming the agency.\n\nThe alliance’s report also included an embarrassing tale about Patel refusing to disembark from a plane in Utah the day after Charlie Kirk’s assassination until he was given an FBI raid jacket and then ended up wearing a woman’s jacket. Patel has denied parts of the story, arguing that he needed a rain jacket because he had no time to pack before heading to Utah after Kirk’s killing.\n\nThe alliance planned to send its 115-page report to Congress later that week. The same group had previously issued damning reports on the Biden-era FBI warning about crippling DEI and the political weaponization of the agency.\n\nBongino fired back at the report, arguing that it was the work of disgruntled “deep-state” FBI agents who were angry over the reforms he and Patel had instituted. \n\nPatel then touted several major reforms during his short tenure and a long list of accomplishments, which included the arrests of 25,000 violent criminals, a 100% increase from last year, and the location and identification of 6,000 victims of child trafficking. Patel also argued that espionage arrests are up 35% under his watch, while fentanyl seizures have increased by 31%.\n\nStill, as of Wednesday, the future of Patel’s and Bongino’s tenure felt rocky at best—until the big announcement that the pair, with the help of key senior FBI agents, had cracked the J6 bomber case.\n\nA source close to the White House and familiar with the president’s thinking described Patel as “a guy with nine lives because anytime you think you have him, he comes back around and does incredible work.” \n\nThe administration has repeatedly and strongly dismissed reports that Trump was considering moving on from his FBI director. To quell the rumors last month, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a photo of Trump and Patel giving the thumbs-up in the Oval Office.\n\nAfter the arrest of the suspected J6 pipe bomber, the same source suggested that another beleaguered Cabinet member look to the FBI director as an example for managing presidential expectations—that “maybe Pete Hegseth needs to start taking pages from Kash Patel’s book.”\n\nWhy keep Patel around? It’s simple, the source said. He puts more points on the board for the administration than he takes off with controversies.\n\n“If there’s talk about whether or not they’re going to drop you, but you keep on winning, even by a small margin, a win is still a win,” the source added, “and the GM is not going to fire you.” \n\nAnother source close to White House and familiar with Trump’s thinking argued that Patel, Bongino, Bondi, and even U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro are working closely and cohesively to “make America safe again.”\n\n“For all this talk about Pam and Kash being on the outs, you don’t have this level of success if there is a dysfunctional relationship between the FBI, the DOJ, and the D.C. attorney,” the source said.\n\nA senior Senate Republican brushed aside “the online back-and-forth” that had consumed Patel in recent weeks, dismissing the controversies as “Beltway chatter.”\n\nThe results, particularly the arrest of the alleged J6 pipe bomber, not Patel’s pugnacious social media posts, speak to his record leading the FBI so far.\n\n“It’s obvious that Patel and Bongino are prioritizing public safety above everything else,” the aide told RCP before adding that the arrest is “a major example of how that leads to success.”\n\nOriginally published by RealClearWire","summary":"FBI Director Kash Patel is back in the safe zone again.

While the Trump administration has all but stopped the crush of migrants that occurred during Biden’s term, neither the government nor the nonprofits that were largely responsible for resettling this vulnerable population of unaccompanied minors have been able to tell RealClearInvestigations where they are living.\n\nExperts say it’s likely that the overwhelming majority of unaccompanied minors remain off the grid because their parents, guardians, and caregivers do not want to draw the attention of immigration authorities. But they also acknowledge the likelihood that some of the migrant minors have been picked up by human traffickers and forced into exploitative labor and sexual roles – a criminal trend that’s on the rise in the U.S. \n\nThis story has been forgotten as politicians and the media have turned their attention away from immigration after Trump virtually closed the southern border.

And it was pretty good copy, if I say so myself: “Whereas, the City of St. Petersburg, home of the friendliest people, the freshest seafood, and the most gorgeous sunsets… blah, blah, blah.”\n\nBut to save time, I used the same copy for both cities, only swapping the names.\n\nI figured, why not? It’s just a photo-op anyway — and to be perfectly honest, the two cities aren’t really that different. (We’re not talking about, say, Miami and Moscow.) They’re two Tampa towns by the bay. Who cares?\n\nAnd besides, it’s not like anyone’s gonna read these proclamations out loud. Right?\n\nAnd the mayor who went second wasn’t pleased about looking like a hack.\n\nI learned an important lesson that day: Don’t be lazy — and don’t assume you know more than you do.\n\nBeing smart enough to know what you’re dumb at is an underrated life skill. Just ask Clint Eastwood:\n\nYou need to settle into a sweet spot of continual improvements, where you constantly gain new ground without overextending your army. Because, if you gain too much ground too quickly, you probably won’t hold onto it very long. \n\nYou’ve gotta solidify your gains.\n\nIt’s something politicians have in common with big businesses: Managing your growth is harder than you think.\n\nYou’d be surprised how many companies go bankrupt not because they couldn’t make a profit, but because they mismanaged their growth. It happens a lot.\n\nScalability is tricky.\n\nEmotionally, we’re attracted to absolutists: the passionate, unbendable zealots who draw a line in the sand and refuse to compromise. We romanticize absolutism.\n\nTrouble is, they don’t produce much: An absolutist who lacks absolute power is absolutely useless.\n\nIt’d be an uphill PR sell, but imagine if a politician campaigned not on absolutism, but on incremental gains. Instead of promising you the moon and stars, he picked a few problems — like crime, jobs, or immigration — and pledged to improve the situation by 10%.\n\nLike abortion: Roe v. Wade wasn’t overturned ‘til 2022. By then, 63 million babies had already been aborted on U.S. soil.\n\nWaiting for the Supreme Court worked… eventually. (Only took 50 years.) So maybe, it would’ve been smarter to focus on reducing the number of abortions by 10% each year. \n\nHad we done this for enough decades, tens of millions of babies would’ve survived.\n\nIt’s not nearly as emotionally satisfying as absolutism, but there’s something to be said for incremental gains. Ex-Fox News Channel personality Bob Massi (RIP) used to tell me, “Scott, you don’t go broke by making a small profit each day.”\n\nPerhaps it’s worth considering.\n\nPRediction: Get ready, ‘cause 2026 will be the Year of Affordability. So, if you love talking about affordability:\n\nYou’re very weird.2026 will be the best year yet.\n\nFor everyone else — especially if you work in professional politics — you better develop an affordability narrative ASAP.\n\nEven if the economy takes off like a SpaceX rocket, affordability will continue to be the talk of the town. It’ll be on the tip of the media’s tongue; it’ll be the lead story of thousands of newscasts.\n\nThat’s because the Democrats can’t afford to let affordability go.\n\nYou’ve gotta see it from their point of view: The Democrats were wandering in the desert, losing to MAGA at every turn. And this time around, they couldn’t blame those dastardly, meddlesome Russians. Trump’s 2024 victory was too lopsided to spin away.\n\nFor almost an entire year, they were terrified they had lost the country.\n\nSo, imagine their relief when affordability became the buzzword du jour, propelling the Dems to victory in New York City, Virginia, and New Jersey. For liberals, it was the greatest miracle since the sainted Obama descended from the heavens. Salvation had arrived!\n\nFinally, they knew how to beat Trump.\n\nThey quickly shifted from calling him Hitler and attacked Trump on affordability at every turn, pretending the word was a magical incantation — the key to slaying the Evil Orange Beast. \n\nMaybe, if they say it enough, they’ll be unstoppable!\n\nLike wannabe Merlins, they’ll keep on chanting “affordability” throughout 2026, hoping it’ll make MAGA disappear. It took ‘em this long to find a winning issue; you’re crazy if you think they’ll let it go without a fight.\n\nYou’ll have to pry affordability from their cold, dead fingers.\n\nThe mainstream media will do all it can to amplify the affordability issue. They’ll pepper every Republican with condemnation, blaming every price increase on MAGA, Trump, and the GOP.\n\nThe Republican Party is committing political malpractice if they’re not investing in fighting this. They need a new narrative ASAP. They need new talking points. And they need to figure out how to counterprogram the mainstream media, because the Affordability Army has amassed on our border.\n\nFrom a PR/crisis communications perspective, it’s priority #1. The midterms depend on it.\n\nPRojection: So, how do we bypass the mainstream media and win on affordability? I’ve got a few ideas:\n\nCreate an irrefutable “dashboard” of five ordinary household expenditures (think: cost of milk, gallon of gas, price of eggs, etc.) and track them. Could be anything, as long as it makes sense to the average American family. (And if you’re thinking the Trump administration could cherry-pick items that exploded under Biden and have fared far better under him, you’re thinking strategically.)Give these five items a catchy name. For example, if our five items are bread, ice cream, detergent, eggs, nursery (diapers, etc.)… well, what do you know: we have the acronym B.I.D.E.N. Which means, we’ve now got ourselves the B.I.D.E.N. Index for measuring painful, record-setting inflation.Publish the B.I.D.E.N. Index on every federal communications outlet. Push it hard on conservative media. Make it famous on social media. And brand Donald Trump as the man who fixed B.I.D.E.N.’s mess.\n\nPRaise: To the popcorn-worthy catfight between two aspiring 2028 presidential candidates, ex-Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-Penn.). This is a story conservative media should elevate, because it’s the sort of dirty laundry that the Dems try to keep behind closed doors.\n\nThe backdrop is simple: When Harris interviewed Shapiro for a potential role as her running mate, she wrote in her book that Shapiro was a power-hungry, elbow-throwing narcissist. Therefore, she had no choice but to go with Captain Charisma, Tim Walz. (Who is very smart and has all the right chromosomes, too.)\n\nThe original article is from The Atlantic. \n\nHere’s a recap from The Hill:\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) accused former Vice President Kamala Harris of telling “blatant lies” to write her postcampaign memoir “107 Days” and “cover her a–,” according to a profile about the governor published in The Atlantic on Wednesday.Reporter Tim Alberta described Shapiro as “between outrage and exasperation as I relayed the excerpts” about him from Harris’s book. She accused Shapiro of taking over the conversation when he was interviewed to be her running mate, allegedly insisting on being “in the room for every decision,” Alberta wrote.“She wrote that in her book?” Shapiro asked. “That’s complete bulls—. I can tell you that her accounts are just blatant lies.”\n\nOh, it gets even juicier:\n\nAlberta also told Shapiro about some of the questions Harris recounted him asking her during the interview, including about the size of the vice president’s Naval Observatory home and if the governor could loan Pennsylvania art for the residence.Shapiro defended himself and said that anyone would ask questions “if someone was talking to you about forming a partnership and working together.” When asked if he felt betrayed by Harris, Shapiro “snapped,” Alberta wrote.“I mean, she’s trying to sell books and cover her a–,” Shapiro responded before he backtracked and told Alberta, “I shouldn’t say ‘cover her a–.’ I think that’s not appropriate. She’s trying to sell books. Period.”\n\nOf course, it’s very possible Harris was right. Perhaps Shapiro is a squirrely, pushy, untrustworthy backstabber. (If so, he’s in the right line of work.) But methinks the real reason why he was snubbed was less because of his ambition — and more because he’s a Jew who once wore the IDF uniform.\n\nGiven the extent of liberals’ hate for Israel, Shapiro risked fracturing the base. Can’t risk triggering the r-word: rebellion.\n\n(Meanwhile, Gov. Walz is focused on the other r-word.)\n\nPRedators: Candace Owens climbed atop Charlie Kirk’s corpse and monetized his murder better than any other influencer. She’s insinuated that Charlie’s closest friends, staff, and Turning Point USA employees participated in his assassination. \n\nErika Kirk was suspect, too.\n\nOnly Candace was smart enough to see through the conspiracy. (Fortunately, she was willing to share her wisdom with the rest of us unwashed masses.)\n\nShe even told Turning Point USA, “You could pick the place, you could pick the time,” and she’d be there to reveal the TRUTH about Charlie’s assassination like only she could!\n\nSo, they took her up on it:\n\nNot all that’s done in name of “truth” and “justice,” promotes truth and accomplishes justice.Thankful for the incredible @BlakeSNeff @DrFrankTurek on the show today!I’ll be happy to address all of this on the livestream with you guys.Sincerely,Mikey McCoy? pic.twitter.com/lNqqCqM8Jb— Mikey McCoy (@Michael_McCoyy) December 3, 2025\n\nNext came the invite:\n\nThe livestream we announced on the show Wednesday has been set.At 4 pm Eastern, 2 pm local time on Monday, December 15, a collection of Charlie's friends will respond to statements made by @RealCandaceO, to set the record straight once and for all prior to the opening of…— Blake Neff (@BlakeSNeff) December 4, 2025\n\nAnd… what do you know, Candace can’t make it: That doesn’t work for her.\n\nHer hypocrisy was duly noted:\n\n🚨Candace Owens BACKS OUT of TPUSA's invitation to debate...HOW CANDACE STARTED: I fully accept.

James Clyburn criticizes redistricting push: 'Are we going to make a mockery out of this democracy?'","text":"WASHINGTON — Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., criticized the nationwide redistricting fight in an interview with NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” arguing that the country is going through “a repeat of a history that led to some catastrophic consequences in our previous history.” Clyburn was asked at the start of the interview whether he agreed with Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., who opposed his state’s redistricting and argued that “if you fight fire with fire long enough, all you’re going to have left is ashes.” “I agree with him entirely,” Clyburn said. Clyburn pointed to the emergence of Jim Crow after the post-Civil War Reconstruction period ended, saying these racist laws and Supreme Court decisions like Plessy v. Ferguson “made a mockery of democracy.” “That is what we are approaching today,” he added, asking: “Are we going to continue our pursuit of a more perfect union, or are we going to make a mockery out of this democracy?” His comments come after the Supreme Court allowed Texas to use a new congressional district map, which could help Republicans gain five House seats in next year’s midterm elections. Texas’ move set off redistricting battles across the country, with state legislators on both sides of the aisle pushing to redraw maps to favor their party. Separately, Clyburn responded to former first lady Michelle Obama’s comments last month saying that the U.S. is not ready for a woman president. Asked whether he agreed with Obama, Clyburn said that she “is absolutely correct,” but argued that it did not mean we should stop trying. “If you look at the history, we demonstrated that we were not ready,” Clyburn said. “These are incredible women who have run: Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris, and I think that we are getting there. That’s why we can’t afford to turn the clock back.” He added that “just because it doesn’t seem that we are ready, doesn’t mean we should stop the pursuit.” “My dad used to tell me all the time, ‘Son, the darkest part of the night is that moment just before dawn.’ And so we may be in a dark moment as it relates to women serving as president, but we may be in that moment just before dawn, where the woman will serve,” he continued. “And in order for that to happen, they have got to run.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/james-clyburn-criticizes-redistricting-push-supreme-court-texas-rcna247817","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251207-jim-clyburn-vl-958a-b81499.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 16:09:49","author":"Megan Lebowitz","authors":["Megan Lebowitz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.359},{"id":385909082,"title":"WATCH -- Tim Walz's Daughter: Trump Calling Dad 'Retarded' Has 'Unleashed F**king S**t Storm'","text":"Minnesota Gov.

That question lies at the heart of President Trump's campaign to kill suspected drug smugglers on small boats in the Caribbean. To justify the killings, the president has declared that the U.S. is in an armed conflict with drug cartels and that the boat crews are combatants.\n\nA wide array of legal experts from both parties question that claim, including former Obama White House lawyer Tess Bridgeman, who told the New Yorker that the Trump administration is knowingly justifying murder. And that debate was brought into stark relief this week by two revelations.\n\nThe fact that a secondary strike in September killed two survivors of a first strike and President Trump's decision to pardon the former president of Honduras, who is serving a 45-year prison sentence for conspiring to smuggle 400 tons of cocaine into the United States. That drew a blunt response from Republican Senator Thom Tillis, who said simply, I hate it.\n\nSenior White House Correspondent Selina Wang starts us off.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nTRUMP: -- pinpoint attacks.\n\nSELINA WANG, ABC NEWS SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This week, stunning revelations and a stark divide on Capitol Hill. For the first time, senior lawmakers were shown video of multiple U.S. strikes against one suspected drug boat on September 2nd, the second strike, killing two survivors.\n\nThe top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee describing that second strike as an attack on defenseless survivors, an act that if true would violate international law.\n\nHIMES: You have two individuals in clear distress, without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel, who were killed by the United States.\n\nWANG (voice-over): A source who has seen the video telling ABC News, the survivors were clinging to the overturned boat and appeared incapacitated, defenseless, and waving at something overhead. But some Republicans emerged with starkly different conclusions. Sen. Tom Cotton asserted each of the four strikes were entirely lawful and necessary.\n\nCOTTON: I saw two survivors trying to flip a boat, loaded with drugs, bound for the United States, back over, so they could stay in the fight.\n\nWANG (voice-over): Democrats urging the administration to publicly release the video. Trump telling me this week, he would have no issue doing so.\n\nWANG: Will you release video of that strike, so that the American people can see for themselves what happened?\n\nTRUMP: I don't know what they have, but whatever they have, we'd certainly release, no problem.\n\nWANG (voice-over): But Secretary Hegseth saying on Saturday, it's under review.\n\nPETE HEGSETH, (R) SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: Whatever we were to decide to release, we'd have to be very responsible about. So we're reviewing that right now.\n\nWANG (voice-over): Earlier this week, Hegseth said the decision to strike again was made by Admiral Mitch Bradley, who was leading Joint Special Operations Command at the time of the strike.\n\nHEGSETH: He sunk the boat -- he sunk the boat and eliminated the threat. And it was the right call. We have his back.\n\nWANG (voice-over): Lawmakers from both parties say Admiral Bradley told them Hegseth did not give an order at the mission's outset to kill everyone aboard the boat. I pressed the president on accountability.\n\nWANG: Mr. President, in the boat strikes, if it is found that survivors were actually killed while clinging on to that boat, should Secretary Hegseth, Admiral Bradley or others be punished?\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think you're going to find that this is war, that these people were killing our people by the millions, actually.\n\nWANG (voice-over): But Congress has not given any more authorization and some legal experts say going after drug smugglers is not the same as being at war. Previously it's been a mission the U.S. Coast Guard has handled by intercepting boats and making arrests.\n\nThe September 2nd strikes are just one piece of a far larger and increasingly controversial campaign. Since September, the U.S. has hit at least 22 suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific killing at least 87 people, including a strike on Thursday that killed four. Some lawmakers and legal experts question whether the entire operation is even legal.\n\nSEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): This campaign has been going on for months. I think it deserved a fuller and more clear briefing and legal justification.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWANG (on-camera): And, George, the president keeps on saying this is all about cracking down on drug trafficking, but that pardon of the former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernandez, tells a different story. This freed someone the Justice Department says spent nearly two decades helping cartels move mountains of cocaine into the United States, a man convicted of being involved in one of the largest and most violent drug trafficking conspiracies in the world. George?\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Selina Wang, thank you.\n\nWe're joined now by Congressman Adam Smith, the top Democrat on House Armed Services Committee.\n\nCongressman, thank you for joining us this morning. You've seen these videos. You were briefed by Admiral Bradley and others. Can you just describe what you saw and what you heard?\n\nREP. ADAM SMITH (D-WA): I think Jim Himes described it really well. There were two -- survivors on an overturned boat, and Senator Cotton's description of it is simply not accurate. When they were finally taken out, they weren't trying to flip the boat over. The boat was clearly incapacitated. A tiny portion of it remained capsized, the bow of the boat. They had no communications device. Certainly they were unarmed.\n\nAny claim that the drugs had somehow survived that attack is hard to really square with what we saw. So it was deeply disturbing. It did not appear that these two survivors were in any position to continue the fight. And then you get into the larger issue, which you previewed of what is the fight exactly? They were trying to bring drugs, and not even to the United States, by the way. There's no evidence, I mean, the drugs were going to some other point.\n\nWhere they were going to be transshipped from there and, again, no congressional authorization for this. If it is a war, then there should be either congressional authorization or compliance with the war powers resolution. So this seems to go directly against Donald Trump's pledge to keep us out of wars. He seems to be dragging us into one without legal authorization.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Let me just pin you down on one point because Secretary Hegseth also said yesterday that the survivors could have still been in the fight and have access to radio, link up with another boat carrying the drugs.\n\nSMITH: Yes, that's ridiculous. There are no radios. They ought to release the video. If they release the video, then everything that the Republicans are saying will clearly be portrayed to be completely false and people will get a look at it and they will see.\n\nThe boat was adrift. It was going where the current was going to take it, and these two were trying to figure out how to survive. And the interpretation of this, that if maybe there were still drugs somewhere on that boat, that justifies the use of deadly force is an incredible expansion of presidential power.\n\nIf you say anyone who has drugs that they're intending to illegally transit to the U.S. is a legitimate target for deadly force, the amount of power that gives the president and the U.S. military is unprecedented and something that ought to be concerning to all of the American people.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: On the release of the video, President Trump has said he's fine with having it released but Secretary Hegseth also said yesterday that's still being reviewed and he raised the possibility that they can't release it because they don't want to compromise sources and methods.\n\nSMITH: Yes, that's ridiculous. I mean, how many videos have they released to date? I'm not sure. It's like 15 or 20. They've showed the strike. It's not very hard to make sure that nothing in that video, you know, shows anything. If they showed us just the portion that we saw, those two on the boat, it's no different than any of the dozen plus videos they've already released.\n\nI mean, it seems pretty clear they don't want to release this video because they don't want people to see it because it's very, very difficult to justify. And, again, the big issue here is President Trump is dragging us into a foreign conflict when we have domestic issues that we're supposed to be paying attention to, that we need to be paying attention to. It's\n\ndirectly contrary to the campaign that President Trump ran.\n\nAnd is this really about drugs, or is it about regime change in Venezuela? Are we about to go to war with Venezuela? The president has alluded to that repeatedly over the course of the last several weeks, couple months now. And that, too, I think, would be very, very bad for the national security interests of our country.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Have you or any of your colleagues in Congress been given any briefings on the possibility of land strikes in Venezuela and taking out President Maduro?\n\nSMITH: We have not. And that's the other aspect of this Department of Defense and the president. They don't really think that Congress should be allowed to exercise their oversight. They have not kept us informed on this. They did not inform us of these strikes.\n\nThe decision to go forward with this was made in late July. The execute order that the White House gave the Department of Defense was issued on August 5th. By law, they are supposed to transmit that execute order to Congress within 30 days. They haven't. They have no intention of doing so.\n\nLook, I mean, that's the biggest problem with this Department of Defense. They don't seem to think the law applies to them.\n\nI mean, let's start with the fact, it's the Department of Defense. I'm out at the Reagan Defense Forum, and they're all running around calling him the secretary of war, the Department of War. The law states clearly, it's Department of Defense. They don't care what the law is. They do and say what they want.\n\nAnd look, we're going to have arguments between the executive branch and the legislative branch. Every president that I've worked with as a member of Congress has that, but all prior presidents at least gave some effort to follow the law. This one doesn't seem to want to, and the secretary of defense doesn't either. That undermines our representative democracy and our Constitution.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You say the secretary of defense doesn't want to follow the law. We also saw this inspector general's report on the release of sensitive information but -- on the Signal messaging app before the strikes in Yemen. Secretary Hegseth has called that a complete exoneration. Your response?\n\nSMITH: Yeah, it's ridiculous. And in addition to not following law, he doesn't want any accountability. He was asked yesterday at the Defense Forum here, you know, do you have any regrets about the way you handled that? At which point, he gave a philosophical answer about how life's too short for regrets.\n\nI disagree with the secretary in that point. It's perfectly okay to look back at past actions and say, yeah, I didn't do that right.\n\nLook, he released sensitive information on an unsecured public app (ph) that went to a journalist. How anybody anywhere in the national security sphere, much less the secretary of defense, can look at that and say, \"Oh, good. No worries. I'd do it again\"?\n\nI mean, okay, you make a mistake, whatever. But admit it, you are not supposed to share that type of information.\n\nAnd the report says clearly the secretary placed our troops at unnecessary risk. So, for the secretary of defense to look at that poor report and say, “I placed troops at unnecessary risk, and I'm okay with that. I did nothing wrong” -- that's really disturb -- really disturbing.\n\nWe need them to follow the law, and we need some measure of accountability. We can disagree on policy a bunch of different areas, but we can't have a completely unaccountable secretary of defense who repeatedly ignores the law. And that's what we're -- we're battling with in Congress right now to hold them accountable.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, I want to ask you about the president's pardon of the former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernandez. Of course, the pre -- the pardon power is absolute. Congress has no recourse to stop it.\n\nBut is there anything more the public needs to know about this? Can you think of any justification for the pardon?\n\nSMITH: No, I mean, I think what the public needs to know about this and I also like to point out the pardon of Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road crypto guy who was setting up a secret way of using crypto to basically launder billions of dollars in drug money. He was convicted of laundering drug money and Trump pardoned him.\n\nLook, it seems like this isn't that much about drugs coming into the U.S. It's more about what Trump released with their national security strategy a couple days ago, three days ago now, where he wants to assert dominance over the Western hemisphere. He wants to go back to the 19th century where the U.S. does what it wants in the Western hemisphere, the Monroe Doctrine.\n\nAnd look, that's disturbing. You know, for 80 years, we have tried to develop a international system that is based on law, a rules-based system. And Trump seems to want to smash that. And if he can go after Venezuela and go after Maduro, that's one way of doing it.\n\nThe Honduras thing seems to have to do with the presidential election that's going on down there and the party that supports Trump or the party that doesn't support Trump. So, it seems to be much more about that than any legitimate desire to stop what, by the way, is a huge problem. Drugs in the U.S. are a huge problem.\n\nBut they keep -- you know, just one more example. And this fentanyl is killing a lot of people. There's no fentanyl involved in what we're blowing up down in the Caribbean, even though the White House and others keep saying that. This is cocaine, which is a problem.\n\nBut if you really wanted to get after this, you'd be putting pressure on China to stop the precursors, and you'd be putting pressure on Mexico where the fentanyl comes.\n\nThere seems to be much more about President Trump’s world vision of the U.S. needing to\n\ndominate the hemisphere than it does about protecting Americans from the incredible problem that we have with drug overdoses and death.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman, thanks for your time this morning.\n\nI want to bring in now Senator Eric Schmitt of Missouri, a member of the Armed Services Committee in the Senate. And Senator, let me just begin where we left off with Congressman Smith. Do you support this pardon of the former Honduran president?\n\nSCHMITT: I'm not familiar with the facts or circumstances, but I think what's telling here is to try to imply that somehow President Trump is soft on drug smuggling is just ridiculous. It's totally ridiculous. He's the -- he has provided border security like we've never seen before. And the fact is, these cartels now, because the southern border is closed, they've gone to the high seas.\n\nSo, President Trump is acting with his core Article II powers. No serious legal expert would doubt that the president has authority to blow narco terrorists out of the water, who are poisoning a hundred thousand Americans every year. If you watched the SEC Championship Game yesterday, the Big 10 Championship Game, combine those two stadiums with the number of people there, that's how many people are dying each every year from the poison that's coming from these narco terrorists.\n\nSo the fact is, George, President Trump has been delegated the authority by Congress to designate terrorist organizations. He has done that. He sent a letter to Congress saying he was going to initiate these strikes. We've had regular briefings about it, including from Secretary of State Rubio, including from other high-ranking officials in the Department of Defense. He's executing those.\n\nAnd so now, what we have now are Democrats who have such X-ray vision in clairvoyance that they know the intentions of narco terrorists on boats, yet were so blind to see that they had a president for four years that was operating as a vegetable in Joe Biden. So, forgive me if I'm a little skeptical that this isn't all about politics and trying to take out Secretary Hegseth. That's what this whole thing's been about, George.\n\nThey didn't want him confirmed. They didn't want a realist in place. They didn't want to shift from their pet projects around the world and trying to build democracies in the sand of the Middle East by the barrel of a gun. We have core national interests at stake, the homeland and the Western Hemisphere, and the rise of China. That's what this administration is focused on.\n\nThe Democrats are just upset about that, and they try to create some controversy each and every week, and it goes nowhere.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: What do you mean you're not familiar with the facts and circumstances of the pardon? It's been well reported all across the country. He is the former president of Honduras. He was convicted of conspiring to bring in 400 tons of cocaine into the United States, also guns and other materials. It's been front page news across the country. Aren't you curious about that?\n\nSCHMITT: Well, I'm curious about your pushback on that particular point. With your previous guest, you had zero pushback because he is, giving the Democrat talking points like you spew every single week, which is probably why your ratings are so bad. But to make the point, what I'm saying is that you're trying to divert here the attention from what the American people actually support.\n\n75 percent of Americans support us blowing narco terrorists out of the water in the Caribbean who are trying to poison Americans. There's no real legal debate about the ability to do that. Now, you could have a policy discussion about it, which now you see the Democrats pivoting from the second strike and the war crimes allegation to really what this whole thing is about. Should we do it -- be doing it in the first place?\n\nI have way more sympathy for my friends, my cousins, my neighbors, those people who've been poisoned by these narco terrorists, people who've been skinned alive by these cartels that they bring people to the United States than I do for these narco terrorists. I mean, that's just the reality of the situation. So, there's legal justification for it. He's doing it. We do have more of a focus on our interest now in the Western Hemisphere, and I'm thankful for that.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Do you support the pardon of the convicted drug smuggler or not?\n\nSCHMITT: George, like I said, what we're talking about here are the narco terrorist poisoning Americans. This attempt to try to focus on a pardon is classic because you've lost the debate now on the narco terrorist question. Because at the beginning of the week, you had Democrats actually on camera saying you should disobey orders. That's what Senator Kelly and Slotkin were saying, you should disobey orders. And then they went so far as to say that if you do -- if you don't do that, you might get prosecuted down the road.\n\nIt's hard to sort of overstate how problematic that is for the chain of command and what it is for a military. The Democrats had their shot at all this and it was rejected. They wanted to have DEI struggle sessions in our military, transgender surgeries, recruitment was way down. The fact is under President Trump and now Secretary Hegseth, recruitment is sky high. Morale is sky high. They're upset about that, because they had an agenda that said that America could be everywhere all at once all the time.\n\nNow, we have a president that's a realist, focusing on core national interest, including protecting Americans from being poisoned by the narco terrorists.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Just to clarify, the Democrats you talked about were talking about illegal orders, they were specific about saying it was illegal orders --\n\nSCHMITT: Yeah.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: -- that they were talking about. Sure.\n\nSCHMITT: Sure. But when you press them on -- but when you press them on what orders are they talking about, they had no answer except to say that, somehow they should be guessing along the way. I mean, it's ridiculous. It's really ridiculous. And this is kind of the rabbit hole of Trump derangement syndrome, is that they can't let this thing go. They can't\n\nbelieve that he won.\n\nThey didn't want Hegseth to be the secretary of War. They fought it. He was their number one target. They failed at that. And so now you just have a series and series of issues that come up every week to try to undermine the president and the secretary of war. And it's not working. They're going to carry out their mission. They executed another strike of a narco-terrorist just this past week.\n\nThose will continue and they're completely authorized. I reviewed the 40-plus page memo by the Office of Legal Counsel. There's JAG officers in these room, George, every time there's a strike. So, again, the narrative at the beginning of the week that these are war crimes, that's clearly fallen away and now the Democrats are peddling another lie.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You mentioned Secretary Hegseth. Here's a quote from the Department of Defense inspector general report on that release of sensitive information over the Signal app. According to the inspector general, \"The secretary sent information identifying the quantity and strike times of manned U.S. aircraft over hostile territory over an unapproved, unsecure network approximately two to four hours before the execution of those strikes. The secretary's actions created a risk to operational security that could have resulted in failed U.S. mission objectives and potential harm to U.S. pilots.\"\n\nIsn't that a concern?\n\nSCHMITT: I reviewed the I.G. report and it's a nothingburger. The fact is there were allegations this was confidential or classified information, I should say. It wasn't. There was no operational integrity problems that that Operation Roughrider was executed flawlessly. So was by the way Midnight Hammer. So you can't really call that into question. There's no confidential or classified information that was disclosed.\n\nAnd, again, I think the bigger concern that you didn't have a hue and cry about from the Democrats was when Secretary Lloyd Austin went in for a medical procedure, was incapacitated and didn't tell the president. Literally, we had a secretary of defense that wasn't on duty and nobody knew about it. Like that's a real problem.\n\nThis was a nothingburger and that's what the I.G. report that I read last week in the SCIF indicated.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: It said it was a risk to operational security.\n\nSCHMITT: But it wasn't. It wasn't. There was no -- listen, remember, when the scandal -- so-called scandal started, it was about classified information being disclosed. It wasn't classified information. So, again, you pivot to this sort of sensitive information, but there was no risk. There was no risk. And by the way, I'll point out, Signal is approved by the U.S. government for communications. And so if you want to have a broader discussion about that, we probably can. But I think the bigger issue was, you know, in the previous administration you had real operational risk. You had a department, you had a secretary of defense that was incapacitated in a surgery and nobody knew about it for days. That's a problem.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator, thanks for your time this morning.\n\nSCHMITT: Thanks, George.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: The \"Roundtable\" is up next. We're back in two minutes.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: This is fake narrative that the Democrats talk about. Affordability. They just say the word. It doesn't mean anything to anybody. The word affordability is a con job by the Democrats.\n\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Donald Trump says there's no affordability crisis. What kind of world is he living in? He's a billionaire. He doesn't have to worry about paying his medical bills, his heating bills, his food bills.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Cost of living debate this week.\n\nLet's talk about it on our roundtable with former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, former DNC chair Donna Brazile, and former Trump White House chief of staff Reince Priebus.\n\nAnd Chris, let me begin with you. We just saw the president right there calling this a hoax, dismissing the concerns about affordability that has caused some concern even inside the White House and among Republican ranks. They think that the president may be repeating former President Biden's mistakes.\n\nCHRIS CHRISTIE, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I don't think it's that bad yet, George. But what I'd say is that, you know, he's cranky right now. I mean, that's the -- for those of us who have known Donald Trump for a long time, he gets into these modes at times where things aren't going the way he wants, right?\n\nSo, this is a guy who has spent most of his presidency this second time around on the correct side of 80-20 issues. And that's been part of his strength and his power politically.\n\nHe's on the wrong side pretty consistently in the last few months of 80-20 issues. You know, the Epstein files was an 80-20 issue against him. Now, affordability is an 80-20 issue against him. And he doesn't like it because that goes to the core of who he believes himself to be, which is the economy president.\n\nAnd when it's not being perceived that way by the public, he's seeing the poll numbers change. He gets cranky.\n\nSo instead of trying to change it that way, he tries to convince people what you're seeing doesn't exist.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Can the White House turn this around?\n\nREINCE PRIEBUS, ABC NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah, they can even turn it around. I think what he -- what he's cranky about is the fact that some of the messaging, I think, on the Republican side isn't where it needs to be. I mean, he had the huge tax bill. Gas prices are down. Inflation from where it was a year ago is in a much better place, and I think it's going to take some time for it to come around.\n\nAnd I think that impatience of that time of this issue coming around them getting hammered on affordability is making him cranky. That's true. But I think all in all, he's got a lot to be proud of.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: What does he need to do, though?\n\nPRIEBUS: Well, I think -- I think what you're seeing is that I think getting these trade deals done by the end of the year is very important. May not happen with Canada and China, but it's important. And you're also seeing him and the administration target some exceptions to these trade deals, whether it be coffee, whether it be bananas, whether it be -- and I think that is going to spill into exceptions in the world of manufacturing, on component parts, on autos, and you're seeing the administration do it.\n\nI think the president is going to have a strong economy, but the question is, is this economy going to start kicking in with enough time before the midterms? And I think that's what the Trump administration is hoping. I think they're going to do it.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Question for the Democrats, can they make this cost-of-living message stick?\n\nDONNA BRAZILE, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely, George. Because every time you go to the grocery store, when you want to buy new furniture, new appliances, when you're trying to pay your utility bills, the American people are getting sick and tired of the lies. They're worried that Donald Trump is not looking at the problems that they're facing in their everyday lives. Too many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nI think the president is not just cranky. I think he is really upset that his policies are not working. His tariff policies not -- are not working, and he knows that. He knows that the American people are waiting to exhale, and he's promising $2,000 that will probably not materialize.\n\nBut for now, Democrats are going to seize this moment not just on the affordability crisis, but they're going to make sure that the Republicans own this healthcare crisis, which is about to hit everybody.\n\nPRIEBUS: I forgot where we were a year ago, in the Biden economy.\n\nBRAZILE: Oh, we have an -- \n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPRIEBUS: What was the inflation rate? How much were eggs? You were talking about making gumbo and egg omelets that you can make -- \n\nBRAZILE: And avian flu. And avian flu. And avian flu. Yes. Of course, the egg prices have gone down a little bit. Gas prices have gone down.\n\nPRIEBUS: A little bit?\n\nBRAZILE: But you know what? You can drive your car to the nearest grocery store, and you still find that the price of chicken, coffee, and the rest of those goods are going way up.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Chris, let's pick up on the healthcare debate. This could be a freight train coming for everybody in Washington right now.\n\nCHRISTIE: Yeah.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Next year, 22 million Americans are going to face a huge increase in their health care premiums. It doesn't appear that the Republican Party is any closer to a response on this. The president said he might be for extending the subsidies, then appeared to take it back.\n\nCHRISTIE: Yeah. Look, I think it's hard because I don't know that he has the votes for extending the subsidies. And this is part of the problem of being on the wrong side of 20-80 stuff, right? Because he's starting to lose a bit of that completely reflexive support that he's had from his majority party in Congress.\n\nAnd this issue is going to really be difficult for both parties because in the end, people are not going to care who's making those premiums go up. They're going to blame everybody.\n\nAnd because the Republicans are in charge of both houses of Congress and the presidency, it’s going to hit them more or have ramifications to them more.\n\nAnd one thing I would say about what Reince mentioned about the tariffs and the changes on some of the individual items, part of the problem is that his people have been out there saying all along that tariffs don't affect the consumer. That no, no, no, the governments are paying this and other companies are paying it.\n\nBut if you're going to exempt certain things to try to bring the prices down, a coffee or whatever, you're admitting that the tariffs are affecting consumers. And this undercuts the president's entire theory about tariff being the most beautiful word.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Yeah. Then also, we don't get the revenue if you have all these exceptions.\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, that's right. So he's caught in between. So all these things go back to why is he cranky? Why is he saying the things that he's saying, not just on this, but on other topics. And it's because, right now, he's really stuck and his majority is thin in the House. And you want to talk about cranky, look at those people.\n\nPRIEBUS: Well, they're moving through it. I mean, obviously you -- they're making adjustments and I think they're smart adjustments. And I think as the tax --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You're talking about the tariffs?\n\nPRIEBUS: -- and the tariffs. I mean, on the ACA, I don't really disagree with what Chris said. I think, the reality is most of us, people like me, can't stand Obamacare, thinks it rewards too many people for inaction that could be working more, but some of them are not. I actually don't think out of the 20-some million on Obamacare, there's maybe five or six million that might be voters that the president would want to make sure they stay on our side of the aisle.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is, without an alternative, as Chris said, it's a big problem. And what -- you need to have an alternative, you need consensus. And I think consensus is more elusive --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Do you see one developing out there?\n\nPRIEBUS: -- than even an alternative?\n\nBRAZILE: No, George, there's no consensus because look, Senator Cassidy of Louisiana is going to put forward some alternative. We don't know if that's going to pass. Then you have Senator Scott from Florida because Florida is going to be hit hard. There's a lot of Floridians who are on Obamacare in their marketplace. And Senator Hawley is trying to put something forward.\n\nThe Democrats are going to stay united on extending the subsidies for maybe three years while the Republicans try to get their act together on healthcare. The Republicans don't have an alternative to Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPRIEBUS: It won't affect -- it will not -- the issue, what I was trying to say before, the issue of the ACA subsidy, the extenders, the issue of us shutting that down, that issue alone, I don't think is going to affect our ability to win an election.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: It's 22 million people.\n\nPRIEBUS: I understand that. But of that amount, I really don't think a lot of those people are on our side. But secondly, the bigger issue is that we have to have an alternative and the media is going to go bananas with this issue. And it's going to create a scenario that over excites the country on something, I don't think --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRAZILE: It's a problem.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCHRISTIE: Here is a concern.\n\nPRIEBUS: I said it (ph) was a problem.\n\nCHRISTIE: Look at the concern politically, and you saw it play out in New Jersey and Virginia. The people who are going to vote in these non-presidential years are folks who are motivated most of the time by anger right now.\n\nBRAZILE: Yeah.\n\nCHRISTIE: And the people who are angry right now and are motivated are the Democratic voters and the left-leaning independents, who are saying the president's not delivering. And a lot of those left or leaning independents voted for Donald Trump because they rejected Kamala Harris for a whole bunch of reasons.\n\nAnd so what we saw in New Jersey was Mikie Sherrill, the Governor-elect, win by 470,000 votes in New Jersey. Even for a blue state like ours, that was incredible because Trump voters stayed on the sidelines.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: That debate is coming. We're out of time right now.\n\nUp next, is artificial intelligence a mortal threat to human civilization? I'll speak with an expert raising the alarm when we come back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOE ROGAN, THE JOE ROGAN EXPERIENCE HOST: The fear would be that we would no longer have control and that we would no longer be apex species on the planet.

I just think it's extremely unlikely.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: That was Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang brushing off concerns about the dangers of A.I. with podcaster Joe Rogan.\n\nAs artificial intelligence races ahead, we're taking a closer look in both the promise and the peril of the technology. I'll speak with the co-author of a new book warning about the\n\ndangers of superhuman artificial intelligence after this report from Jay O'Brien on how Washington is addressing the A.I. challenge.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nJAY O’BRIEN, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Just over three years since the launch of ChatGPT stunned the world and catapulted artificial intelligence into the mainstream -- \n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A.I. revolution.\n\nBRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Artificial intelligence.\n\nJOHN OLIVER, COMEDIAN: Artificial intelligence or A.I.\n\nO’BRIEN (voice-over): -- that technological revolution now sparking a growing divide between those sounding the alarm --\n\nGEOFFREY HINTON, FORMER GOOGLE EXECUTIVE: Sometime in the next 20 years, these things will get smarter than us and we really need to worry about what happens then.\n\nO’BRIEN (voice-over): -- and others touting A.I.'s potential.\n\nJENSEN HUANG, NVIDIA PRESIDENT & CEO: The best-case scenario is that A.I. diffuses into everything that we do. Everything's more efficient.\n\nO’BRIEN (voice-over): But as artificial intelligence gets smarter by the day, the federal government has struggled to keep up.\n\nIn the last few months, President Donald Trump welcoming tech luminaries to the White House and set an ambitious A.I. goals.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: America is the country that started the A.I. race. America is going to win it.\n\nO’BRIEN (voice-over): Trump rolling back Biden era A.I. regulations and installing entrepreneur and tech investor David Sacks as his A.I. and cryptocurrency czar.\n\nDAVID SACKS, WHITE HOUSE A.I. & CRYPTO CZAR: It's really the job of government to enable the private sector and get the red tape out of the way.\n\nO’BRIEN (voice-over): And the president pressuring Republicans in Congress to pass legislation prohibiting states and local governments from regulating artificial intelligence in any way, warning overregulation is threatening to undermine this growth engine.\n\nSome in the president's party pushing back.\n\nREP. THOMAS MASSIE (R-KY): I think this is a state and local issue.\n\nO’BRIEN: Why do you think the president adopted that position?\n\nMASSIE: Probably donors. Maybe he just thinks it's the best way to get A.I. going in this country.\n\nREP. JAY OBERNOLTE (R-CA): I know that no industry wants to be regulated, but also no one can deny that A.I. is such a powerful technology that the malicious use of it creates some really negative consequences.\n\nO’BRIEN (voice-over): But on Capitol Hill, lawmakers largely on the sidelines when it comes to the A.I. revolution. A flurry of bills have been proposed, but not a single piece of notable A.I. regulation has ever cleared the House or Senate, despite some members expressing mounting concerns.\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): A super intelligent A.I. could replace human beings in controlling the planet.\n\nO’BRIEN: Do you think Congress is behind on this issue?\n\nREP. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-MA): Republicans in Congress are because what they're trying to do is at the federal level, nothing, and at the state level, prevent any state legislators from doing any regulation of A.I. bots whatsoever.\n\nO’BRIEN (voice-over): A.I. companies stress while risks for the technology exist, they say the potential benefits are nearly limitless and that they're constantly improving their algorithms to improve interactions, all while some industry leaders have gone from publicly encouraging regulation -- \n\nSAM ALTMAN, OPENAI CEO: I think if this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong. And we want to be vocal about that. We want to work with the government to prevent that from happening.\n\nO’BRIEN (voice-over): -- to now warning about too much red tape.\n\nALTMAN: I am nervous about standards being set too early. We need the space to innovate and to move quickly.\n\nO’BRIEN (voice-over): Meanwhile, Congress seems stymied.\n\nSEN. MIKE ROUNDS (R-SD): The fear is, is if you regulate it, you slow it down. If you don't regulate it, you have people that could get hurt.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Thanks to Jay for that.\n\nWe're joined now by Nate Soares, co-author of the new book, “If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies: Why Superhuman A.I. Would Kill Us All”.\n\nMr. Soares, thank you for joining us this morning.\n\nI want to start out with a summary of your thesis that you write in your book. I'm going to put up on the screen. “If any company or group anywhere on the planet builds an artificial super intelligence using anything remotely like current techniques based on anything remotely like the present understanding of A.I., then everyone, everywhere on Earth, will die.”\n\nThat is about as stark a warning as you can possibly get.\n\nCan you spell it out for us and tell us why you believe that?\n\nNATE SOARES, MACHINE INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH INSTITUTE PRESIDENT: You know, I wish it was fiction, but the way that we make A.I.s today is more like growing an organism than it is like carefully crafting a piece of traditional software. The A.I.s we make, they have the very beginnings now of goals or objectives, or so it seems. We don't really know what's going on inside them.\n\nThey have the very beginnings of goals and objectives that we didn't try to give them. They have emergent behavior that their operators never intended. In lab scenarios, we've already seen them sometimes try to escape the lab or blackmail the operators. They're too dumb right now for that to work. But if we keep rushing to make A.I.s that are smarter and smarter to the point where these sorts of things succeed, then the most likely outcome is they become much more powerful than us. They pursue goals nobody intended, nobody wanted.\n\nAnd the most likely outcome of that is that we die, not because the A.I.s hate us, but because they are utterly indifferent. It would be sort of like ants under a skyscraper.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: As you know, many of your critics have said that this is more like science fiction than science. One of the problems with Stephen Marche (ph), for example, “The New York Times”, pointed out is you haven’t fully defined your terms like intelligence or super intelligence. He says the book reads like a Scientology manual. So, why don't you start out by defining that artificial super intelligence that you're so worried about?\n\nSOARES: Yeah, we do actually define the terms in the book, if he had read. I think it's in chapter one. We define artificial super intelligence as an A.I. that is better than the best humans at every mental task. This is not the sort of A.I. we have today, but the A.I.s of today, many people's only experience with A.I. is ChatGPT. The people who have been in the field of A.I. understand that the field of A.I. is a moving target, that sometimes people come up with insights, come up with new ways of doing A.I. that unlock whole new domains of A.I. like ChatGPT and the Large Language Models of today.\n\nOne of the big questions is what happens when there's new insights? What happens when there's new breakthroughs? These companies are rushing to make A.I.s that are smarter than every human. And once we get these super intelligent A.I.s, I think the most likely outcome is that they don't do exactly as the humans say.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And I know you say you're agnostic on exactly how the extinction would happen, but just lay out one possibility.\n\nSOARES: The one easy way for an A.I. to take out humanity would be a virus. This, as you say, I'm not -- I'm not sure exactly how it would happen. It's a little bit like trying to predict a football game between an NFL team and a high school team. It's hard to predict the plays. It's easy to predict the winner. The sort of real question here is something like, what will the A.I.s be pursuing? Will they do exactly what the operators say? And we're already seeing the very beginnings of evidence that the answer is no, just like theory has predicted for years.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Do you see any evidence that anyone is doing anything to control this? A lot of the optimists about A.I. say that you can calibrate the systems internally.\n\nSOARES: People are trying to control these A.I.s. The type of work that people tend to do tends to fall into evaluation metrics, trying to see how dangerous the A.I.s currently are, and interpretability research, which is trying to understand what is going on inside the A.I.s. With any other technology, like with a nuclear reactor, if you ask people, how do you know you're going to be able to make this not melt down? And they said, well, we have two teams, one who is trying to figure out what's going on inside there. And another saying we're measuring whether it's currently exploding. You might not be very confident that these people were on track to do the job properly.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: How much time do we have?\n\nSOARES: You know, the timing is very hard to call. It could be that next year the A.I.s will still be pretty dumb, but they'll be just barely smart enough to make smarter A.I.s that make smarter A.I.s, that make smarter A.I.s. And then things could go very quickly. It could be that it takes 10 years. It could be that the current A.I.s stay kind of dumb and it takes 10 years to have some new breakthrough that unlocks new A.I.s like last breakthroughs -- like previous breakthroughs unlocked ChatGPT.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. Soares, thanks very much for your time this morning.\n\nUp next, Martha Raddatz revisits Pearl Harbor and shares the effort to bring its history to a new generation.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nFRANKLIN ROOSEVELT, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: December 7th, 1941, a date which will live in infamy. The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: That day of infamy 84 years ago has passed from the memory of most Americans, but the lessons it teaches still on display at the Pearl Harbor Aviation Museum on Ford Island in Honolulu.\n\nMartha Raddatz traveled there for a conversation with the museum's new leader, a former Navy Blue Angel who is bringing his passion for history to a new generation.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): It was just before 8:00 a.m. on December 7th, 1941.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Japanese have attacked the Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, from the air.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Waves of attacks by Japanese bombers devastating the airfields and warships at the naval base leaving more than 2400 Americans dead, including 1177 on the USS Arizona. The site now a solemn memorial. The Ford Island operations building and control tower were witness to the attack, now part of the Pearl Harbor Aviation Museum.\n\nChairman of the Board of the museum, retired U.S. Air Force General Ray Johns, taking me up in a World War II T-6 built in 1944.\n\nGEN. RAY JOHNS USAF (RET.), PEARL HARBOR AVIATION MUSEUM BOARD CHAIR: OK. Are you ready?\n\nRADDATZ: Ready.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): The general flying the same deadly route some 350 Japanese aircraft took including those that bombed the Arizona.\n\nIf you were looking up in the air that day, what would you see?\n\nJOHNS: Chaos. You would see tornado bombers coming in, the cates. You would see dive-bombers coming in. You'd see fighter zeros doing strafing runs. You'd see all that ongoing, and you're in pure panic.\n\nJOHN HILTZ, PEARL HARBOR AVIATION MUSEUM CEO: The Arizona is just over here.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): For John Hiltz, the new CEO of the museum, it is that horror and that history he wants people to remember.\n\nHILTZ: Nowhere else in America can you stand on an American battlefield that was in World War II. These are hallowed grounds in a similar fashion to Gettysburg, like Normandy. You know, what happened here created a new world order, and I think that's an incredibly powerful lesson to tell.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Hiltz is a decorated combat pilot himself and a former member of the Navy's famed Blue Angel Team. I first met Hiltz nearly a decade ago aboard the USS Truman in the Persian Gulf, leading a mission in the fight against ISIS in Syria.\n\nHILTZ: We've got a 30-minute window to execute. And we'll make sure that we do so.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): This video from the nighttime mission showing Hiltz refueling his jet midair with lightning and thunder surrounding him. But Hiltz and his wingman still managing to successfully take out ISIS targets. Hiltz says he was inspired as a child to\n\nbecome a pilot by sitting in the cockpit of a fighter jet at an aviation museum. He's now bringing that inspiration to the next generation, including his own daughter, Soren.\n\nRADDATZ: What do you see for this museum in the future? What is your dream for this museum?\n\nHILTZ: The dream of anything like this is that it has to be constantly reinvented and retold in new ways to make sure that it is impacting new generations of visitors that can understand the cry behind, Remember Pearl Harbor. For somebody that had a similar attack perpetrated in Manhattan right before I entered the service, to think that, that could ever be forgotten or not remembered in the same way is heartbreaking in some ways and I think Pearl Harbor has to be in the same breath. The lessons that we learned here cannot be forgotten.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): And those lessons come alive at this museum. Hangar 79 was struck that day. You can still see bullet holes from the attacks that shattered the windows.\n\nHILTZ: It was a maintenance hangar and people were in here working that morning on Sunday, December 7th, and ran out to some trenches that were dug out on the flight line and took cover there.\n\nRADDATZ: I think people, when they think of Pearl Harbor, they think of the Arizona --\n\nHILTZ: Right.\n\nRADDATZ: -- or the Utah. It -- this is different.\n\nHILTZ: Those are really poignant reminders of the sacrifices that were made that day. But I think the other important neat concept is that Pearl Harbor, the attack on Pearl Harbor was an air raid and it was a novel air raid. It was logistically unprecedented in scope and scale. And to be able to tell that story about how that day transformed our nation, our world, but also how America responded to it. Those stories need to be told because they really do echo in eternity.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): And Hiltz has a personal connection to the site. He flew over the Arizona during a Blue Angels air show in 2014, taking this remarkable photo. You can just make out the American flag patch on his uniform, reflecting on the cockpit window in the lower right corner.\n\nHILTZ: And know that, at a place that I flew over with the Blue Angels in 2014, now I'm fortunate enough to steward into this next iteration is incredibly moving and it's the reason I'm here.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Finding his new purpose, honoring the past and inspiring the next generation.\n\nFor \"This Week,\" Martha Raddatz, A BC News, Pearl Harbor.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Thanks to Martha. We'll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: That is all for us today. Thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us. Check out \"World News Tonight\" and I'll see you tomorrow on GMA.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)","summary":"Rep. Adam Smith and Sen. Eric Schmitt were on \"This Week\" Sunday, August 28.

Ron DeSantis and Sen. Rick Scott, have weighed in for the conservative candidate, former city manager Emilio Gonzalez, in the otherwise nonpartisan race. Nationally known Democrats, including former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, have offered support on behalf of Eileen Higgins, a Democrat who served on the county commission before winning a runoff spot last month.\n\nAn upset for the Democrats on Tuesday would give the party an additional burst of momentum heading into a crucial election year when control of Congress will be at stake, especially in a region that has become increasingly friendly turf for Republicans and where Trump plans to build his presidential library.\n\nHiggins, who had represented a district that leans conservative and includes the Cuban enclave of Little Havana, proudly wears the label of “La Gringa,” a term Spanish speakers use for white Americans. A Spanish speaker herself, Higgins has focused her campaign relentlessly on local issues such as the cost of housing while capitalizing on national ones, including the treatment of immigrants under the Trump administration in a city with sizable Hispanic and foreign-born populations.\n\n“I have been a Democrat serving in a primarily Republican district, and all I have done is work for the people,” she told The Associated Press.\n\nDemocrats will try to break Republicans’ grip on power\n\nMiami is Florida’s second most populous city, behind Jacksonville, but is the epicenter of the state’s diverse culture and is among the nation’s most prominent international destinations, giving its mayor an outsize platform.\n\nThe city of 487,000 is part of Miami-Dade County, which Trump flipped last year, handily defeating Democrat Kamala Harris after losing the county to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. A loss for Gonzalez would be perceived in Florida as a setback for the GOP and Trump.\n\nChristian Ulvert, Higgins’ campaign manager, said early returns of mail ballots are encouraging. About 44% had been cast by registered Democrats as of Thursday, a day before early in-person voting began, compared with about 30% by registered Republicans.\n\n“What you’re seeing is great Democratic enthusiasm and turnout that matches that enthusiasm,” he said.\n\nHiggins, who would be the first non-Hispanic mayor of Miami in almost 30 years if elected, said she is confident she will receive support not only from Democrats, but also from unaffiliated voters and some Republicans because of her work as an elected official.\n\nHer pitch to voters includes finding city-owned land that could be turned into affordable housing and cutting unnecessary spending. She was asked during a recent forum sponsored by the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce if she would try to turn the more ceremonial role of mayor into a full-time job and not take on other work, something that raised ethical concerns for the current mayor, term-limited Francis Suarez.\n\n“I do not have outside employment now. I was a full-time commissioner. I’m going to be a full-time mayor,” Higgins said as the interviewer continued to press her about whether that meant not accepting any outside employment.\n\nIn a blunt-talking style, Higgins responded sternly: “All right, do I have to say it more clearly? No! It’s a full-time job.”\n\nRepublicans worry as Latino support wavers\n\nWhile Latino voters nationally have traditionally leaned Democratic, Republicans in Florida have found strong backing among Cuban, Venezuelan and Nicaraguan immigrants, who resist socialist inclinations likened to the ones from the governments they fled. Trump tapped into those sentiments in winning Miami-Dade County last year, a turnaround from his 30 percentage point loss there to Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nYet some Florida Republicans began sounding the alarm after November’s elections, when Democrats secured wins in nationally watched governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia. Both winning candidates had strong performances with nonwhite voters, and the Democratic winner in the New Jersey race received two-thirds of the Hispanic vote, according to the AP Voter Poll.\n\nThose results were largely seen as a reflection of concerns over rising prices and the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration policies.\n\nU.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, a Republican whose district includes the city of Miami, called the elections elsewhere a “wake-up call.” Ileana Garcia, a Florida state senator who in 2016 founded the group Latinas for Trump, has said about immigration arrests that “what we are witnessing is inhumane.”\n\nGonzalez, a former director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under Republican President George W. Bush, said during a debate sponsored by Miami’s CBS affiliate that he supported immigration arrests against those who committed crimes. But he demurred when the moderator said most of those arrested had not committed violent offenses: “But this is a federal issue,” Gonzalez said. “This is not an issue that has to do with the mayor of Miami.”\n\nHiggins has spoken about Miami’s signing on to a federal program that delegates immigration authority to local police, county sheriffs and state agencies and said she would find legal options to unwind that decision to rebuild trust between residents and law enforcement.\n\n“When we start to enforce whatever shenanigans is coming out of the federal government to just randomly pick people up, we could erode that trust,” she said.\n\nFlorida Democrats hope to kickstart their climb back to relevancy\n\nHiggins has received support from Florida Democrats looking to show the party still has a foothold in the formerly swing state.\n\nSome Democrats who could be considering a presidential run in 2028 also are backing her campaign. Buttigieg encouraged voters in a video to make a plan to vote for her, U.S. Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona joined her Sunday for early voting stops and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is scheduled to appear at a rally for her Monday.\n\nMany of the local issues at play in the race resonate nationally, including income inequality and one of the nation’s least affordable housing markets.\n\nGustavo Ascani, a 30-year-old Miami voter, said the city has long-standing problems that need addressing. He said he has not decided whom he will vote for, but said tackling homelessness and traffic is a priority for him.\n\n“Maybe Republicans have overlooked, after having locally been in power for so long, certain issues that are important for the people in Miami,” Ascani said.\n\nRobin Peguero, a former prosecutor who is running for the chance to challenge Salazar for her congressional seat, said voters’ concerns center around affordability, an issue that has become a focal point of both parties after Democrats’ wins in New Jersey and Virginia.\n\nThat includes the sharp health insurance premium spikes expected to start Jan. 1 after subsidies under the Affordable Care Act expire. The Obama-era health law remains popular in South Florida, and recent polling shows most people who will be affected by the increases blame Trump and Republicans. \n\n“It’s kitchen table issues, whether it’s an election for local officials or whether there is an election for the president,” Peguero said. “It’s a rejection of what is happening in this country.”\n\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Higgins represented a district that includes Little Havana, but she does not live there.","url":"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2025/12/07/democrats-see-an-opening-to-win-the-miami-mayors-race-in-the-latest-test-of-the-us-political-mood/","image":"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Election_2025-Miami_Mayor_99721-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 15:01:31","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.067},{"id":385896852,"title":"Mayor's race in Miami is the latest test of the nation's political mood","text":"MIAMI (AP) — It has been nearly three decades since a Democrat held the mayor’s office in Miami, a span of futility the party is hoping to reverse during a special runoff election this week in one of the last electoral showdowns before next year’s midterms.\n\nWhile it is a local race, this election has become the latest test of the nation’s political mood nearly a year into President Donald Trump’s second term.\n\nTrump and other big-name Florida Republicans, including Gov.

Walz to 'Fix' Medicaid Fraud or Lose Funding","text":"Minnesota’s leftist governor, Tim Walz, got a stern warning from a Trump official on Friday regarding the potential loss of Medicaid funding unless he gets a handle on alleged fraud.\n\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said in a social media post authorities in the state including Walz (D) needed to be investigated “because they’ve been asleep at the wheel,” Fox News reported Saturday.\n\n“Based on what we know now, this is a clear dereliction of duty,” Oz wrote:\n\nIn recent years, Minnesota Medicaid launched several new programs, including Housing Stabilization Services, which helped disabled homeless individuals, and Early Intensive Developmental and Behavioral Intervention, which reimbursed therapy costs for families with autistic children. Some bad actors in Minnesota’s Somali community decided to game the system. And when they got away with it, they decided to go bigger.\nThe housing program was supposed to cost $2.6 million dollars annually. Last year, it paid out over $100 million. The autism program ballooned from $3 million in 2018 to nearly $400 million in 2023.\n\nOz pointed out some of the allegedly stolen taxpayer money may have gone to the Somalian terrorist group Al-Shebab. Indeed, Breitbart News reported “The stolen billion in Medicaid and welfare money didn’t merely go into the pockets of corrupt Somalian migrants. They also went to fund terrorism in Africa.”\n\nOz said in order to “restore the integrity” of the program in the state, officials must:\n\n1. Provide CMS with weekly updates on how the state is stopping fraud.\n2. Freeze enrollment of all high-risk providers for 6 months.\n3. Confirm all providers in place are legitimate or remove them.\n4. Send CMS a corrective action plan of how these will prevent this from happening again.\n\n“If we’re unsatisfied with the state’s plans or cooperation, we’ll stop paying the federal share of these programs. The message to Walz is clear: either fix this in 60 days or start looking under your couch for spare change, because we’re done footing the bill for your incompetence,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Minnesota Department of Health and Human Service Employees (DHS) claimed the group alerted Walz to the alleged fraud in the early stages, but said he retaliated against whistleblowers, per Breitbart News.\n\n“Tim Walz is 100% responsible for massive fraud in Minnesota. We let Tim Walz know of fraud early on, hoping for a partnership in stopping fraud but no, we got the opposite response. Tim Walz systematically retaliated against whistleblowers using monitoring, threats, repression, and did his best to discredit fraud reports,” the group said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump chose Oz to serve as the CMS Administrator after he won the presidency a second time, beating out former Vice President Kamala Harris (D) and Walz, who was her running mate.\n\nTrump said at the time, “America is facing a Healthcare Crisis, and there may be no Physician more qualified and capable than Dr. Oz to Make America Healthy Again. He is an eminent Physician, Heart Surgeon, Inventor, and World-Class Communicator, who has been at the forefront of healthy living for decades.”","summary":"Minnesota's leftist governor, Tim Walz, got a stern warning from a Trump official on Friday regarding the potential loss of Medicaid funding unless he gets a handle on alleged fraud. \n\n\nThe post &#8216;We&#8217;re Done Footing the Bill&#8217;: Dr. Oz Warns Minnesota Gov.

Organizations associated with climate alarmism have recently found themselves engulfed in turmoil. Bill Gates has recanted earlier predictions of gloom and doom. But the Father of Climate Panic, former Vice President Al Gore, remains steadfast, if increasingly marginalized.\n\nLet’s start with probably the best-known environmental organization in the world, the Sierra Club. According to a recent New York Times report, the club thrived when it seemed laser-focused on the environment. But then, during Donald Trump’s first term, “its leaders sought to expand far beyond environmentalism, embracing other progressive causes. Those included racial justice, labor rights, gay rights, immigrant rights and more.”\n\nAs a result of the effort to morph into a catch-all for a myriad of social justice causes, the Times noted that by 2022 the Sierra Club “had exhausted its finances and splintered its coalition.” By August, according to the Times, the number of Sierra Club “champions” – “a group that included dues-paying members as well as supporters who had donated, signed petitions or participated in events” – was “down about 60 percent from its high in 2019.”\n\nDespite the upheaval, few lessons seem learned. The Times noted that “in recent weeks, supporters who clicked on the group’s website for ‘current campaigns’ were presented with 131 petitions, some out of date, like calls to support clean-energy funding that Mr. Trump has already gutted, or to support a voting-rights bill that died in 2023.”\n\nAsked whether he had any regrets, the club’s current board president, Patrick Murphy, summoned the spirit of Kamala “not a thing comes to mind” Harris and replied, “I have a hard time pinpointing how I believe we should have made different choices.” Alrighty then.\n\nAlso falling on hard times is 350.org, which first gained notoriety for its successful efforts to block the Keystone XL oil pipeline during the Obama administration. As Politico reported this month, the group “will ‘temporarily suspend programming’ in the U.S. and other countries amid funding woes.”\n\nExecutive Director Anne Jellema said 350.org “had suffered a 25 percent drop in income for its 2025 and 2026 fiscal years, compelling it to halt operations,” and would subsequently reduce its global staff by about 30 percent.\n\n“The group had endured economic hardship over the years, including problems of financial management and several rounds of layoffs that eroded its influence,” Politico reported. Jellema said the organization was facing its challenges “with our ambition intact.” But apparently not much else.\n\nAn implosion of a different kind is from the world of “green banking.” NBA star Kawhi Leonard’s endorsement contract with the pro-environment group Aspiration is alleged to have been a vehicle for Leonard and the Los Angelas Clippers to skirt NBA salary cap rules.\n\nAs reported by ESPN, Aspiration Partners was a company founded in 2013 to provide “socially-conscious and sustainable banking services and investment products.” Their slogan was, “Do Well. Do Good.” Catchy. Operating like an environmentally conscious digital bank, Aspiration promised to “never fund fossil fuel projects like pipelines, oil rigs and coalmines.” The company’s products included “an option to plant a tree with every purchase roundup.”\n\nAccording to ESPN, Clippers owner Steve Ballmer invested $50 million in Aspiration. The subsequent allegation is that Leonard signed a $28 million endorsement deal with Aspiration “as a way to circumvent the league’s salary cap.” Ballmer has denied any knowledge of the deal, according to the report. Leonard has also denied any wrongdoing.\n\nESPN reported that Aspiration filed for bankruptcy in March, and co-founder Joe Sanberg pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud after “federal prosecutors said Sanberg defrauded investors and lenders out of $248 million by fraudulently obtaining loans, falsifying bank and brokerage statements and concealing that he was the source of some revenue booked by the company.”\n\nThe NBA is investigating. How many trees Aspiration planted is unknown.\n\nTo add insult to injury comes what appears to be an about-face from no less a dedicated environmentalist than Bill Gates. For decades, Gates has been a leader in the movement to reduce carbon emissions. But last month he caused a stir when he declared that climate change “will not lead to humanity’s demise.”\n\nIt’s heartening when others finally catch on. Earlier this year, the climate group funded by Gates, Breakthrough Energy, laid off dozens of employees in the U.S. and Europe “as it pulls back from public policy advocacy work that was a cornerstone of its mission,” as the industry site Energy Connects reported.\n\nSadly, such admirable retrospection will likely never occur to Al Gore, arguably history’s leading figure in propagating climate hysteria and someone who has reportedly made a fortune from his climate alarmism. Gore’s reaction to Gates’ newfound enlightenment was a predictable temper tantrum during which he speculated that Gates had succumbed to “bullying” by President Trump.\n\nTakes one to know one – Gore has often been accused of bullying those not on board with his climate crusade.\n\nIn an increasingly splintered movement that once marched in lockstep, it may be that someday only Al Gore will remain – the last true believer of a story he largely authored, perched atop his high horse at his solar-powered compound.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/climate-groups-falter-bill-gates-recalibrates-al-gore-soldiers","image":"/s3/files/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2025-12/693466_80%281%29.jpg?h=db10b5f4&amp;itok=KSF0Uceo","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 14:20:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.213},{"id":385888310,"title":"Aftyn Behn: AOC, or Tammy Faye-O-C?","text":"I’m gonna stop worrying about the length.\n\nOf these podcasts, I mean!\n\nIt’s Thursday, December 4, 2025.

What Could Go Wrong?","text":"The Supreme Court has steadily loosened campaign finance rules in a series of decisions ever since Chief Justice John Roberts was confirmed in 2005. They will look to go further on Tuesday, when the court hears arguments in a case challenging the 50-year-old limits placed on coordinated spending between parties and candidates.\n\nIn NRSC v. Federal Election Commission, a Republican campaign committee is challenging limits placed on how much money political parties can spend in direct coordination with candidates. Those limits, which were put in place in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, were intended as a companion to other rules on how much individuals can contribute to individual campaigns, preventing deep-pocketed contributors from using donations to parties as a work-around to those limits. The current limits on how much a party can spend in coordination with a specific candidate vary, from $63,600 for most House races up to $3.9 million for Senate races in California and even more for presidential candidates.\n\nThe case stems from Vice President JD Vance’s 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio. During the primary, Vance’s fundraising lagged behind his GOP opponents and he relied on outside spending from billionaire Peter Thiel to push him over the top. He continued to struggle to raise money in the general election against Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan. (Vance eventually won.) And so, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the chief political committee for GOP Senate candidates, and Vance brought suit to allow the party to spend unlimited sums in direct coordination with their candidate, arguing the coordination limits infringed on core First Amendment rights for political speech.\n\nLawyers for the NRSC argue that the limits in question block constitutionally protected political speech and do not prevent corruption or its appearance. Since “no one seriously claims that parties are trying to bribe their candidates,” the limits have been defended and upheld in the past as preventing “quid pro quo-by-circumvention,” the NRSC brief states. But this justification was ruled out-of-bounds in the court’s 2014 decision in McCutcheon v. FEC and so the party coordination limits should be struck down, the brief argues.\n\nIndeed, preventing the circumvention of contribution limits is at the heart of the coordinated spending limits. If a political party can raise nearly $1 million from a single donor who wants to spend that on a particular candidate, the party can effectively contribute that $1 million — or more — to the candidate’s campaign by funding, for example, their advertisements as a coordinated expenditure. Since candidates are limited to raising $3,500 per election from a single donor, this would be a major way to circumvent those limits, which are at the heart of campaign finance regulation.\n\nEach lower court that heard the case rejected the NRSC’s arguments, following the Supreme Court’s 2001 precedent in FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee that upheld the limits. There, in a 5-4 decision written by then-Justice David Souter, the court ruled that “a party’s coordinated expenditures, unlike expenditures truly independent, may be restricted to minimize circumvention of contribution limits.” But the Supreme Court took up the case and now could upend campaign finance law yet again.\n\nThe court has upheld candidate contribution limits as constitutional since 1976, so it would be logical for them to prevent their circumvention — particularly as it has become easier for parties to raise the kind of large contributions that the candidate limits are meant to protect against. But that hasn’t held the court back in the past.\n\nSince the court last heard a case challenging coordinated party spending limits, its composition has changed dramatically — and so has its campaign finance jurisprudence. In the years since 2001, the court’s conservative bloc has grown from five to six with no real moderates among them. And with the retirement of Sandra Day O’Connor in 2006, the court lost its last member with any experience running for office or working on a political campaign.\n\nIt has also issued decision after decision gutting federal and state campaign finance laws. The most prominent of these is 2010’s Citizens United v. FEC, a decision that enabled corporations, unions and nonprofits to spend unlimited sums on independent campaign expenditures. But there are more, including the McCutcheon decision that invalidated aggregate contribution limits that put a cap on how much money a single donor could contribute in total in one election cycle.\n\nThese campaign finance decisions have largely been based on a repeated misunderstanding of how candidates and parties use money in elections. In each case, the court’s decisions loosening campaign finance restrictions have led to massive unintended — at least according to the court’s writings — consequences, such as an increase in undisclosed campaign money and illegal foreign donations and the circumvention of party contribution limits. \n\nThere’s no reason to think that won’t happen here.\n\n“This case needs to be looked at in the context of the court’s now-two-decade run of substituting its own judgment for that of voters and Congress on campaign finance,” said Daniel Weiner, a campaign finance law expert for the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning nonprofit.\n\nIn Citizens United, then-Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion, explained his decision by stating that “independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.” That has proved wildly inaccurate as the corruption convictions of North Carolina insurance executive Greg Lindberg and former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder (R) and the 2015 indictment of then-Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) all involved corrupting contributions made through outside groups making independent expenditures. (Menendez was later convicted of accepting bribes and acting as a foreign agent in a separate case in 2024.)\n\nKennedy also promised that, thanks to the internet and disclosure laws, corporations or others spending unlimited sums on independent expenditures could be held accountable by the public. But Citizens United enabled a radical decrease in the transparency of campaign spending as “dark money” nonprofits, which do not disclose their donors, became significant political spenders. These groups now make up a growing percentage of donors to super PACs. Though super PACs do have to disclose their donors, that does not trickle down to requiring disclosures of the donors to those donors — making the true origin of a large portion of election funding completely opaque.\n\nSimilarly, the notion that independent expenditures are truly independent from candidates or parties has proved to be completely inaccurate. The largest-spending outside groups are those directly connected to party leaders or staffed by close aides to the candidates they support. Candidates provide information, like b-roll and directions on what messages to use in advertising for outside groups, on their websites or surreptitiously on social media. And in 2024, the FEC ruled that supposedly independent groups may directly coordinate with parties and candidates on get-out-the-vote operations. Billionaire Elon Musk went on to do exactly this with the Trump campaign and earned a plum spot in the White House for his efforts.\n\nIn the McCutcheon case, the court’s decision was largely rooted in naive expectations of how political parties would act once aggregate limits were eliminated. The aggregate contribution limits capped the total amount a donor could give in any one election, among all political parties and candidates. The intent was, like the coordinated spending limits, to prevent corruption and work-arounds of the candidate limits.\n\nA key argument in the case was that, absent the aggregate limits, political parties could create a joint fundraising committee that linked all 50 state parties together with the national party and allowed them to easily shift money donated in one state to support a candidate elsewhere. During oral arguments, Alito called these “wild hypotheticals.” \n\nThen-Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority: “The Government provides no reason to believe that many state parties would willingly participate in a scheme to funnel money to another State’s candidates.”\n\nBut that’s exactly what happened. Beginning with Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016, every presidential campaign has created a super joint fundraising committee that then redirects contributions made to non-swing-state parties toward state parties in swing states or back to the national party.\n\nWhile the party coordination limits seem to present less of an opportunity for the court to cause severe unintended consequences with another uninformed decision, there are a couple of things to keep in mind.\n\nFirst and foremost, coordinated spending is done almost entirely in the form of advertising: The candidate designs an ad and plans when and where to run it, and the party foots the bill. But this could have unintended downstream consequences for television stations, which are required to provide candidates with the lowest unit price for campaign ads in the run-up to an election. Neither parties nor outside groups receive this benefit.\n\nIf parties can suddenly subsidize candidate ads, television stations could be put under financial strain as they lose money that they previously received from higher charges on party advertising. This is an argument made by lawyers for the Democratic National Committee, who have entered the case to defend the limits.\n\n“Broadcasters across the country will face significant increases in advertisements that purport to qualify for lowest unit rates, thereby inflicting a substantial financial strain upon them,” the DNC’s brief states.\n\nThis is likely to lead broadcasters to challenge rules that interpret coordinated spending as coming from the candidate and therefore receiving the lowest unit rate, according to Marc Elias, the lead lawyer for the DNC.\n\n“This will have commercial impacts outside of the campaign finance world,” Elias said.\n\nAnd then there are the unintended consequences that may flow within the campaign finance world.\n\nBy eliminating the aggregate limits, the McCutcheon decision opened the door for parties to collect massive contributions from single donors through super joint fundraising committees. In 2024, the maximum contribution to Vice President Kamala Harris’ joint fundraising committee was $929,600 for a single donor. Most of that money wound up with the Democratic National Committee or its state parties, which then circumvented contribution limits by routing that money to swing state committees.\n\nIf the court does end the coordinated spending limits, it will lead to a mass circumvention of the candidate limits — just as the McCutcheon decision did for party limits. And, as the unintended consequences of McCutcheon now flow into the NRSC case, so too would the circumvention of candidate limits lead toward their ultimate elimination.\n\nThere may be reasonable policy reasons to support ending or raising the coordinated spending limits, as the Brennan Center’s Weiner has advocated. In a world where single billionaires like Musk can spend unlimited amounts to directly coordinate with candidates through super PACs, it would be better for political parties, which are rooted in mass democracy and governance, to be on an equal, if not supreme, footing.\n\nBut that should be done by Congress, Weiner argues, not the Supreme Court — which time and time again has shown it does not understand how political campaigns work.\n\n“The ultimate question is who should decide,” Weiner said. “I think it should be Congress that decides. We think of that as a fundamental principle. This is not something within the constitutional competence or, frankly, the expertise of the Supreme Court to make this call.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-nrsc-fec_n_69330f40e4b06a47b6d3c856?origin=home-politics-feed-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/69330fa71900008c657f3614.jpeg?cache=YOPzOkgoy9&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 13:00:17","author":"Paul Blumenthal","authors":["Paul Blumenthal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.328},{"id":385868840,"title":"The Supreme Court Looks At Further Loosening Campaign Finance Rules.

This is an argument made by lawyers for the Democratic National Committee, who have entered the case to defend the limits.\n\n“Broadcasters across the country will face significant increases in advertisements that purport to qualify for lowest unit rates, thereby inflicting a substantial financial strain upon them,” the DNC’s brief states.\n\nThis is likely to lead broadcasters to challenge rules that interpret coordinated spending as coming from the candidate and therefore receiving the lowest unit rate, according to Marc Elias, the lead lawyer for the DNC.\n\n“This will have commercial impacts outside of the campaign finance world,” Elias said.\n\nAnd then there are the unintended consequences that may flow within the campaign finance world.\n\nBy eliminating the aggregate limits, the McCutcheon decision opened the door for parties to collect massive contributions from single donors through super joint fundraising committees. In 2024, the maximum contribution to Vice President Kamala Harris’ joint fundraising committee was $929,600 for a single donor. Most of that money wound up with the Democratic National Committee or its state parties, which then circumvented contribution limits by routing that money to swing state committees.\n\nIf the court does end the coordinated spending limits, it will lead to a mass circumvention of the candidate limits — just as the McCutcheon decision did for party limits. And, as the unintended consequences of McCutcheon now flow into the NRSC case, so too would the circumvention of candidate limits lead toward their ultimate elimination.\n\nThere may be reasonable policy reasons to support ending or raising the coordinated spending limits, as the Brennan Center’s Weiner has advocated. In a world where single billionaires like Musk can spend unlimited amounts to directly coordinate with candidates through super PACs, it would be better for political parties, which are rooted in mass democracy and governance, to be on an equal, if not supreme, footing.\n\nBut that should be done by Congress, Weiner argues, not the Supreme Court — which time and time again has shown it does not understand how political campaigns work.\n\n“The ultimate question is who should decide,” Weiner said. “I think it should be Congress that decides. We think of that as a fundamental principle. This is not something within the constitutional competence or, frankly, the expertise of the Supreme Court to make this call.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-nrsc-fec_n_69330f40e4b06a47b6d3c856?origin=home-latest-news-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/69330fa71900008c657f3614.jpeg?cache=YOPzOkgoy9&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 13:00:17","author":"Paul Blumenthal","authors":["Paul Blumenthal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.328},{"id":385972438,"title":"The Supreme Court Looks At Further Loosening Campaign Finance Rules. What Could Go Wrong?","text":"The Supreme Court has steadily loosened campaign finance rules in a series of decisions ever since Chief Justice John Roberts was confirmed in 2005. They will look to go further on Tuesday, when the court hears arguments in a case challenging the 50-year-old limits placed on coordinated spending between parties and candidates.\n\nIn NRSC v. Federal Election Commission, a Republican campaign committee is challenging limits placed on how much money political parties can spend in direct coordination with candidates. Those limits, which were put in place in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, were intended as a companion to other rules on how much individuals can contribute to individual campaigns, preventing deep-pocketed contributors from using donations to parties as a work-around to those limits. The current limits on how much a party can spend in coordination with a specific candidate vary, from $63,600 for most House races up to $3.9 million for Senate races in California and even more for presidential candidates.\n\nThe case stems from Vice President JD Vance’s 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio. During the primary, Vance’s fundraising lagged behind his GOP opponents and he relied on outside spending from billionaire Peter Thiel to push him over the top. He continued to struggle to raise money in the general election against Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan. (Vance eventually won.) And so, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the chief political committee for GOP Senate candidates, and Vance brought suit to allow the party to spend unlimited sums in direct coordination with their candidate, arguing the coordination limits infringed on core First Amendment rights for political speech.\n\nLawyers for the NRSC argue that the limits in question block constitutionally protected political speech and do not prevent corruption or its appearance. Since “no one seriously claims that parties are trying to bribe their candidates,” the limits have been defended and upheld in the past as preventing “quid pro quo-by-circumvention,” the NRSC brief states. But this justification was ruled out-of-bounds in the court’s 2014 decision in McCutcheon v. FEC and so the party coordination limits should be struck down, the brief argues.\n\nIndeed, preventing the circumvention of contribution limits is at the heart of the coordinated spending limits. If a political party can raise nearly $1 million from a single donor who wants to spend that on a particular candidate, the party can effectively contribute that $1 million — or more — to the candidate’s campaign by funding, for example, their advertisements as a coordinated expenditure. Since candidates are limited to raising $3,500 per election from a single donor, this would be a major way to circumvent those limits, which are at the heart of campaign finance regulation.\n\nEach lower court that heard the case rejected the NRSC’s arguments, following the Supreme Court’s 2001 precedent in FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee that upheld the limits. There, in a 5-4 decision written by then-Justice David Souter, the court ruled that “a party’s coordinated expenditures, unlike expenditures truly independent, may be restricted to minimize circumvention of contribution limits.” But the Supreme Court took up the case and now could upend campaign finance law yet again.\n\nThe court has upheld candidate contribution limits as constitutional since 1976, so it would be logical for them to prevent their circumvention — particularly as it has become easier for parties to raise the kind of large contributions that the candidate limits are meant to protect against. But that hasn’t held the court back in the past.\n\nSince the court last heard a case challenging coordinated party spending limits, its composition has changed dramatically — and so has its campaign finance jurisprudence. In the years since 2001, the court’s conservative bloc has grown from five to six with no real moderates among them. And with the retirement of Sandra Day O’Connor in 2006, the court lost its last member with any experience running for office or working on a political campaign.\n\nIt has also issued decision after decision gutting federal and state campaign finance laws. The most prominent of these is 2010’s Citizens United v. FEC, a decision that enabled corporations, unions and nonprofits to spend unlimited sums on independent campaign expenditures. But there are more, including the McCutcheon decision that invalidated aggregate contribution limits that put a cap on how much money a single donor could contribute in total in one election cycle.\n\nThese campaign finance decisions have largely been based on a repeated misunderstanding of how candidates and parties use money in elections. In each case, the court’s decisions loosening campaign finance restrictions have led to massive unintended — at least according to the court’s writings — consequences, such as an increase in undisclosed campaign money and illegal foreign donations and the circumvention of party contribution limits. \n\nThere’s no reason to think that won’t happen here.\n\n“This case needs to be looked at in the context of the court’s now-two-decade run of substituting its own judgment for that of voters and Congress on campaign finance,” said Daniel Weiner, a campaign finance law expert for the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning nonprofit.\n\nIn Citizens United, then-Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion, explained his decision by stating that “independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.” That has proved wildly inaccurate as the corruption convictions of North Carolina insurance executive Greg Lindberg and former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder (R) and the 2015 indictment of then-Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) all involved corrupting contributions made through outside groups making independent expenditures. (Menendez was later convicted of accepting bribes and acting as a foreign agent in a separate case in 2024.)\n\nKennedy also promised that, thanks to the internet and disclosure laws, corporations or others spending unlimited sums on independent expenditures could be held accountable by the public. But Citizens United enabled a radical decrease in the transparency of campaign spending as “dark money” nonprofits, which do not disclose their donors, became significant political spenders. These groups now make up a growing percentage of donors to super PACs. Though super PACs do have to disclose their donors, that does not trickle down to requiring disclosures of the donors to those donors — making the true origin of a large portion of election funding completely opaque.\n\nSimilarly, the notion that independent expenditures are truly independent from candidates or parties has proved to be completely inaccurate. The largest-spending outside groups are those directly connected to party leaders or staffed by close aides to the candidates they support. Candidates provide information, like b-roll and directions on what messages to use in advertising for outside groups, on their websites or surreptitiously on social media. And in 2024, the FEC ruled that supposedly independent groups may directly coordinate with parties and candidates on get-out-the-vote operations. Billionaire Elon Musk went on to do exactly this with the Trump campaign and earned a plum spot in the White House for his efforts.\n\nIn the McCutcheon case, the court’s decision was largely rooted in naive expectations of how political parties would act once aggregate limits were eliminated. The aggregate contribution limits capped the total amount a donor could give in any one election, among all political parties and candidates. The intent was, like the coordinated spending limits, to prevent corruption and work-arounds of the candidate limits.\n\nA key argument in the case was that, absent the aggregate limits, political parties could create a joint fundraising committee that linked all 50 state parties together with the national party and allowed them to easily shift money donated in one state to support a candidate elsewhere. During oral arguments, Alito called these “wild hypotheticals.” \n\nThen-Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority: “The Government provides no reason to believe that many state parties would willingly participate in a scheme to funnel money to another State’s candidates.”\n\nBut that’s exactly what happened. Beginning with Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016, every presidential campaign has created a super joint fundraising committee that then redirects contributions made to non-swing-state parties toward state parties in swing states or back to the national party.\n\nWhile the party coordination limits seem to present less of an opportunity for the court to cause severe unintended consequences with another uninformed decision, there are a couple of things to keep in mind.\n\nFirst and foremost, coordinated spending is done almost entirely in the form of advertising: The candidate designs an ad and plans when and where to run it, and the party foots the bill. But this could have unintended downstream consequences for television stations, which are required to provide candidates with the lowest unit price for campaign ads in the run-up to an election. Neither parties nor outside groups receive this benefit.\n\nIf parties can suddenly subsidize candidate ads, television stations could be put under financial strain as they lose money that they previously received from higher charges on party advertising. This is an argument made by lawyers for the Democratic National Committee, who have entered the case to defend the limits.\n\n“Broadcasters across the country will face significant increases in advertisements that purport to qualify for lowest unit rates, thereby inflicting a substantial financial strain upon them,” the DNC’s brief states.\n\nThis is likely to lead broadcasters to challenge rules that interpret coordinated spending as coming from the candidate and therefore receiving the lowest unit rate, according to Marc Elias, the lead lawyer for the DNC.\n\n“This will have commercial impacts outside of the campaign finance world,” Elias said.\n\nAnd then there are the unintended consequences that may flow within the campaign finance world.\n\nBy eliminating the aggregate limits, the McCutcheon decision opened the door for parties to collect massive contributions from single donors through super joint fundraising committees. In 2024, the maximum contribution to Vice President Kamala Harris’ joint fundraising committee was $929,600 for a single donor. Most of that money wound up with the Democratic National Committee or its state parties, which then circumvented contribution limits by routing that money to swing state committees.\n\nIf the court does end the coordinated spending limits, it will lead to a mass circumvention of the candidate limits — just as the McCutcheon decision did for party limits. And, as the unintended consequences of McCutcheon now flow into the NRSC case, so too would the circumvention of candidate limits lead toward their ultimate elimination.\n\nThere may be reasonable policy reasons to support ending or raising the coordinated spending limits, as the Brennan Center’s Weiner has advocated.

Nothing, nothing, nothing.”\n\nSeveral people could be seen crying as Biden spoke.

Co-host Michel Martin did the spoon-feeding of Omar: “You've been a favorite target of President Trump since you were elected, but it cannot have been easy to hear him make these comments about the entire Somali community. I just wondered what went through your mind when he said things like they contribute nothing and should go back to where they came from and so on.” Omar replied: “His vile rant really wasn't a surprise to me. He has trafficked in racism, in xenophobia, in bigotry and Islamophobia for as long as he has held office.”\n\nMorning Edition anchor Steve Inskeep underlined NPR is Omar PR with this X post on more of her answer: \n\nOn NPR, Rep.

Not because of anything they’ve done, but because of where their loyalties supposedly lie. According to Fuentes, the 26-year-old white nationalist American Jews are a fifth column, their true allegiance pledged to Israel rather than the United States. He frames this as a national security concern, a matter of protecting America from internal subversion: Jews have U.S. institutions under their thumb and use their power to advance Israeli interests at America’s expense.\n\nThe claim collapses under scrutiny, but not for the reasons you might expect. The problem isn’t just that the facts contradict Fuentes. The problem is that Fuentes himself embodies the precise disloyalty he claims to expose in others. His accusation is thus a confession.\n\nWho Is Nick Fuentes?\n\nFuentes, born in 1998, hosts the “America First” podcast and calls the movement he leads the same name. His followers, known as “Groypers,” engage in organized campaigns to promote his views. He gained notoriety for his presence at the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville and his participation in the January 6, 2021 Capitol events.\n\nFuentes advocates explicitly for a white ethnostate and opposes racial integration. He has denied the Holocaust, asking on his show, “How many Jews do you think really died in the Holocaust?” He has praised Adolf Hitler, stating “Hitler is awesome. Hitler was right. And the Holocaust didn’t happen.” He has called for a “holy war” against Jews and compared the six million killed by the Nazis to “cookies being baked in an oven.” He wants the U.S. government under authoritarian “Catholic Taliban rule” and has been vocal about his disdain for women, Muslims, the LGBTQ+ community, and others. “All I want is revenge against my enemies and a total Aryan victory,” Fuentes said in 2022.\n\nHis speeches frequently attack Jewish influence in media, finance, and politics. He frames Israel as evidence of Jewish disloyalty to America, arguing that American Jews prioritize Israeli interests over American welfare and therefore cannot be trusted as citizens.\n\nThe Accusation: Jews as America’s Fifth Column\n\nFuentes’s core claim is straightforward: American Jews cannot be trusted because their loyalty lies with Israel rather than the United States. In one typical statement, he declared: “The American government is Israeli-occupied territory … Jews are disloyal to America and loyal to Israel.”\n\nHe presents this as a matter of national security, suggesting that Jewish Americans form a fifth column within the country. According to his logic, support for Israel among American Jews proves they place foreign interests above American ones. On Tucker Carlson’s show in October 2025, he argued that “the main challenge” to conservative unity is “organized Jewry in America.” He told Carlson that Jews are “a stateless people” who are “unassimilable” and said Judaism is incompatible with Western civilization, asserting that “they hate the Romans because the Romans destroyed the Temple. We don’t think that, as Americans and white people.”\n\nHe frames his position not as antisemitism but as legitimate concern about conflicted loyalties in positions of power. This argument appears repeatedly across his broadcasts and public appearances, forming a central pillar of his political worldview. The accusation sounds almost reasonable if you don’t think about it too hard. Dual loyalty. Conflicted interests. Foreign allegiance. But when you examine the argument with any rigor, it collapses immediately.\n\nWhy the Accusation Fails: The Selective Standard\n\nStart with the basic problem: Fuentes applies a standard to Jews that he applies to no one else. The United States is a nation of immigrants. Millions of Americans maintain strong connections to other countries. Irish Americans celebrate Ireland. Italian Americans preserve Italian culture. Polish Americans engage with Polish politics. Greek Americans lobby for favorable U.S. policy toward Greece. Cuban Americans advocate specific positions on Cuba. According to Pew Research, approximately nine million Americans hold or qualify for dual citizenship.\n\nThese connections provoke no suspicion. No one suggests that Irish Americans who supported Irish independence were undermining America, or that Greek Americans in government pose a security risk. But Fuentes singles out Jews. Only Jewish Americans face this interrogation. Only their cultural and political connections to another country become evidence of disloyalty.\n\nIf his concern were really about divided allegiance as a general phenomenon, he would apply it consistently. He doesn’t, which means the accusation isn’t actually about dual loyalty. It’s about Jews. Research consistently shows that American identity is layered and complex. The General Social Survey has documented for decades that Americans maintain multiple, non-competing identities. A person can be fully American while also feeling connected to Italian culture, Mexican heritage, or Jewish tradition. The accusation of dual loyalty treats this normal aspect of American life as suspicious only when applied to Jews.\n\nThe selective application becomes even clearer when we examine who else Fuentes attacks. His problem isn’t dual loyalty; it’s racial and religious identity he finds objectionable. He has attacked Vice President JD Vance and his marriage to Usha Vance, a Hindu Indian American, with incendiary rhetoric “replete with references to ‘race mixing,’ mockery of their son’s Indian name,” and criticism of the vice president’s weight. If loyalty to America were really his concern, why attack a sitting vice president for his choice of spouse?\n\nWhat American Jews Actually Vote For\n\nThe empirical evidence makes the failure of Fuentes’s argument even clearer. If American Jews were primarily motivated by loyalty to Israel, we would see it in their political behavior. The 2024 presidential election provides a perfect test.\n\nDonald Trump positioned himself as strongly pro-Israel. His administration moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, brokered the Abraham Accords, and withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal. Trump campaigned explicitly on his record of support for Israel and received enthusiastic backing from the Israeli right. Kamala Harris, while not hostile to Israel, represented a Democratic position that included more criticism of Israeli settlement policy, greater emphasis on Palestinian rights, and willingness to condition aid to the Jewish state. The Democratic platform was measurably less aligned with current Israeli government preferences than the Republican one.\n\nIf Israeli interests drove Jewish voting, Trump should have won overwhelming Jewish support. He didn’t. Approximately 32 percent of American Jews voted for Trump. This pattern holds across decades. American Jews vote Democratic by large margins even when Republican candidates align more closely with Israeli government positions.\n\nConsider the recent election of Zohran Mamdani as Mayor of New York City. The mayor-elect holds positions sharply critical of Israel, the region’s only liberal democracy. If American Jews were indeed primarily motivated by loyalty to Israel, as Fuentes claims, we would expect near-universal rejection of such a candidate. Yet approximately one-third of Jewish voters in New York supported Mamdani.\n\nThis presents a useful thought experiment: How many American citizens of German descent would vote for a candidate who claimed there was excessive German influence in American politics, that German Americans constituted a disloyal fifth column, or that Germans effectively controlled the country? Substantially fewer than one-third, we can reasonably predict.\n\nThe counterfactual clarifies what actual dual loyalty would look like. Yes, if armed conflict ever arose between the United States and Israel (an eventuality approximately as probable as discovering a square circle), there would undoubtedly be profound distress within the American Jewish community. But the same emotional conflict would arise for any American community facing hostilities between their country of citizenship and their ancestral homeland. This is the normal complexity of identity in a nation of immigrants, not evidence of disloyalty.\n\nWhat actually drives Jewish voting? Surveys show that American Jews prioritize domestic issues: the future of democracy (44 percent cite as top priority), abortion (28 percent), the economy and inflation (24 percent), climate change (19 percent), healthcare (12 percent), and church-state separation. According to the Manhattan Institute’s 2024 survey of Jewish voters, abortion topped the list at 33 percent, followed by the economy (28 percent), and democracy/election integrity (27 percent), while “security, Israel, and antisemitism” ranked fourth at only 22 percent. They also express concern about antisemitism and extremism, which they perceive as more threatening from the far right. Their voting reflects American political priorities, not Israeli ones. Notably, despite 72 percent of Jewish voters feeling emotionally attached to Israel, only 6-9 percent consider it a top concern when deciding how to vote. Fuentes ignores this data because it destroys his narrative.\n\nFuentes Dismisses the Constitution\n\nThe projection becomes even more explicit when we examine Fuentes’s own statements about governance and loyalty. He hasn’t just hinted at divided allegiance. He has declared it openly and repeatedly.\n\nDonald Trump has ignored Fuentes and his policy preferences so thoroughly since taking office (e.g. bombing Iran, backing Israel and, with less enthusiasm, Ukraine) that a frustrated Fuentes has had to publicly break from Trump over the course of the last year. So it may be hard to recall that at one point Fuentes called for Donald Trump to “rule by decree.” He tweeted his support for giving Trump dictatorial powers and declared his allegiance to Trump over the U.S. Constitution. This isn’t a casual comment. It’s a systematic vision of governance that mirrors fascist models. His call for “rule by decree” is reminiscent of the powers attained by Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini in 1926 and German Nazi leader Adolf Hitler under the 1933 Enabling Act.\n\nFuentes elaborated on his vision in segments of his America First show. He advocated for the arrest and imprisonment of state governors, media figures, and political enemies. He called for measures to bring constitutionalists and libertarians “to heel.” He described the situation as binary: “You have two options. You can go to jail, or you can put your enemies in jail. There is no third option.”\n\nIn January 2024, Fuentes gave a Nazi salute during a Rumble stream while stating his willingness to commit violence for “Supreme Leader Trump.” He declared: “I am not a Republican…. I want everyone to know that…. I am part of the Revolutionary Guard. I do not answer to the Pentagon. I do not answer to the civilian government.” He continued: “If Donald Trump ordered me to do an extrajudicial killing, I would perform it.”\n\nThis is not theoretical speculation about divided loyalties. This is explicit rejection of constitutional governance in favor of personal allegiance to a leader. Fuentes openly states that he does not answer to civilian government. This is dual loyalty in its purest and most dangerous form.\n\nHis accusation of dual loyalty toward American Jews reflects a projection of his own mindset. His commentary draws heavily on fringe notions, and he has adopted these ideas to a degree that exceeds even the usual bounds of such discourse.\n\nThe Vision: Theocracy and Racial Hierarchy\n\nFuentes’s disloyalty to American constitutional principles goes beyond his vision of installing a dictator. He advocates for a complete restructuring of American society that would require dismantling the Constitution itself.\n\nHe has called for “Taliban rule in America, in a good way.” When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, he celebrated it as the advent of “Catholic Taliban rule” and said it meant that “banning sodomy is back on the menu, banning contraceptives is back on the menu.” This explicitly theocratic vision contradicts the entire framework of constitutional rights.\n\nHis vision for America is even more explicit in its rejection of constitutional principles. On his show in March 2025, Fuentes stated: “Jews are running society, women need to shut the f*ck up, Blacks need to be imprisoned for the most part, and we would live in paradise … White men need to run the household, they need to run the country, they need to run the companies. They just need to run everything, it’s that simple. It’s literally that simple.”\n\nThis vision of racial hierarchy directly contradicts the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection under law. Fuentes’s ideal America would require nullifying the Constitution’s most fundamental provisions. His loyalty isn’t divided between two nations. It’s divided between the Constitution as written and a racial-religious ideology that contradicts it at every level.\n\nFuentes is an effective communicator, though his rhetoric is directed toward deeply hostile themes. Earlier periods in American history might have treated such speech as incitement punishable by law. We do not endorse that approach. We support broad protections for free expression. What remains puzzling is why Tucker Carlson chose to host Fuentes and offered almost no substantive challenge to his claims. To be clear, we do not advocate canceling Carlson’s program, nor restricting Fuentes’s online platforms. We favor strong speech rights for all parties. At the same time, we find the conduct of both figures open to criticism, and as Jews, we also exercise our own right to speak in response.\n\nFuentes has also stated that he would join antifa if they were “waving the banner of Benito Mussolini…waving the banner of Falangism,” referring to Spanish fascists, “and they were saying ‘Catholic fascism now.'” His allegiance is to fascist governance models, not to American constitutional principles. He calls himself a “reactionary” who wants to turn the Republican Party into “a truly reactionary party.”\n\nThe Question Fuentes Can’t Answer\n\nSo here’s the question that cuts to the heart of the matter: if Fuentes had to choose between the Constitution and his racial ideology, which would he pick? If the Constitution protects the equal rights of non-white citizens and his ideology demands their subordination or removal, which loyalty prevails?\n\nThe answer is obvious. Fuentes would choose his ideology. The Constitution’s colorblind principles are obstacles to the America he wants to create. His vision demands subordinating constitutional law to racial hierarchy. His pledge to “not answer to civilian government“ means rejecting constitutional governance entirely. That is dual loyalty in its purest form, except instead of loyalty to a foreign state, it’s loyalty to an ideological program and a “supreme leader“ that contradicts the nation’s legal and moral foundation.\n\nHere stands a man who openly calls for racial hierarchy that would nullify the 14th Amendment, who rejects civilian government entirely, yet he dares to question the patriotism of American Jews whose voting record proves their commitment to American democratic values. This is classical projection at its most transparent. The patriot who isn’t questions the patriotism of those who are.\n\nWhy This Matters Now: Fuentes’s Growing Influence\n\nThe exposure of Fuentes’s contradictions matters more now because his influence is growing, not diminishing. According to conservative writer Rod Dreher, “something like” 30-40 percent of staffers under the age of 30 working for Republican Party officials or institutions in Washington DC are Groypers. Political commentator John Ganz notes there is a “marked” generation gap in the conservative movement, with younger staff members “much more open to Fuentes’s ideas” while the older generation’s “horror of the holocaust, support for Christian Zionism and Dispensationalism, and taboos against antisemitism” are “fading or gone.”\n\nFuentes’s recent interview with Tucker Carlson on the Tucker Carlson Network was seen over 20 million times. Despite being banned from most major platforms, he was reinstated on X (formerly Twitter) by Elon Musk in 2024, where he now has over a million followers. His message is reaching an increasingly mainstream conservative audience.\n\nThis makes it all the more important to expose the fundamental contradiction at the heart of his message. He warns about traitors while articulating a vision that would betray the Constitution. He claims to defend America while rejecting its foundational principles. He accuses others of dual loyalty while pledging loyalty to racial ideology over democratic governance. The traitor who warns of traitors has given us a confession, not an argument.\n\nREAD MORE from Walter E. Block and Oded J.K.

While the Trump administration has all but stopped the crush of migrants that occurred during Biden’s term, neither the government nor the nonprofits that were largely responsible for resettling this vulnerable population of unaccompanied minors have been able to tell RealClearInvestigations where they are living.\n\nExperts say it’s likely that the overwhelming majority of unaccompanied minors remain off the grid because their parents, guardians, and caregivers do not want to draw the attention of immigration authorities. But they also acknowledge the likelihood that some of the migrant minors have been picked up by human traffickers and forced into exploitative labor and sexual roles – a criminal trend that’s on the rise in the U.S. \n\nThis story has been forgotten as politicians and the media have turned their attention away from immigration after Trump virtually closed the southern border. But the recent shooting of two members of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., by an Afghan refugee who had collaborated with the U.S. special forces has brought the issue of a broken immigration system back to the forefront. \n\nNearly half a million unaccompanied minors under the age of 18 were apprehended at the border between 2021 and 2024, overwhelming the immigration system. Taxpayers spent more than $23 billion on a network of government agencies, construction companies, and nonprofits charged with finding them a safe place to live while sponsors were sought. \n\nNow the entities that took the money are unwilling to address the whereabouts of the minors. Nor are they forthcoming about how they spent – or misspent – the funding that was supposed to avoid the very problem the nation faces of missing migrant children.\n\n“They don’t want to talk about it,” said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies. “Those groups are the very ones that were pressing to release the unaccompanied kids faster.” \n\nThe Biden Migrant Surge\n\nThe problem of unaccompanied minors began when Joe Biden took office and embraced more lax policies at the border. During Trump’s first term, an average of 43,707 minors annually crossed the border alone; the figure dropped to 15,381 when the pandemic emerged in 2020. In 2021, however, that figure skyrocketed to 122,731, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). In 2022, the number hit an all-time high of 128,904 before tapering off to 98,356 in 2024. These numbers represent the unaccompanied minors that were encountered by U.S. officials and do not include “gotaways,” so the actual total is significantly higher.\n\nAll told, the average annual number of unaccompanied children coming to the U.S. under Biden was nearly double the highest single prior year of 2019, ICE figures show. More than half of those who came each year since 2019 were 16 years old or younger, with nearly a quarter aged 12 or younger. \n\nThis year, monthly data indicates the problem of newly arriving unaccompanied minors has virtually disappeared. In October, the average number of “children in care” was 2,244.\n\n“Sealing the border had made a huge difference,” said Laura Lederer, a former senior advisor on trafficking in persons for the State Department. “Stopping illegal immigration is essentially a human trafficking prevention program.”\n\nRise in Human Trafficking\n\nFor undocumented minors already in the U.S., they are at risk of falling victim to predators who can take advantage of their separation from family and caregivers. Recent press accounts have described horror stories, with minors allegedly exploited from North Carolina to Los Angeles. Precise figures on victims of sexual trafficking or forced labor are impossible to find because the illegal operations are underground.\n\n“For everyone we know about, there could be two, three, or even four times more,” said Lederer, a leading American researcher on human trafficking. \n\nThe process of illegal immigration, which has been a cash cow for smuggling organizations, also claims victims. Minors may fall prey to groomers or recruiters and be forced to function as lookouts, guides, or spies, according to the Department of Defense’s Combating Trafficking in Persons unit.\n\nEven federal agencies involved in finding minors are tight-lipped about their operations. In recent weeks, a Memphis Safe Task Force, led by the U.S. Marshals Service and including teams from ICE and Customs and Border Protection, has rescued 116 juveniles. How many of those were unaccompanied minor border crossers is unclear. The U.S. Marshals Service did not respond to questions.\n\nIowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley has been following the issue for years. Federal whistleblowers at his hearings have described a haphazard system for caring for unaccompanied minors, in which information is not shared among federal agencies, contractors, and law enforcement. Last year, Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) whistleblowers said that contractors would release minors to sketchy, unverified partners, suspicious strip-mall businesses, and, in one Michigan case, in an open field.\n\nPrompted by those reports, Grassley sent referrals to the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding potentially criminal behavior by more than “100 suspicious sponsors” last year. But the Biden-Harris administration failed to fully respond to two-thirds of the subpoenas issued by law enforcement. In the last four years, there were more than 65,000 reports of possible illegal acts ignored or dismissed, of which roughly 7,300, or 13%, involved human trafficking, according to an Inspector General’s report.\n\nThe Trump administration claims it has processed some 28% of the backlog, leading to 36 investigations accepted for prosecution, seven indictments, 25 arrest warrants, 11 arrests, and three convictions.\n\nBlaming the Problem on Paperwork\n\nWhen Vance spoke about the exploitation of unaccompanied minors in the October 2024 vice-presidential debate, he took his 300,000 figure from a recent report from the DHS’s Inspector General. Within hours, left-wing groups and press outlets sprang to the Biden administration’s defense, downplaying the severity of the situation and insisting the huge number “lacked context.”\n\nSome pro-immigration groups said it was merely “a missing paperwork problem,” according to the Acacia Center for Justice’s Unaccompanied Children Program. It was a “premature” conclusion that they were lost, said the American Immigration Council, while the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights said they were not “effectively lost.”\n\nRCI reached out to all three of those groups repeatedly, asking how they assessed the current situation with unaccompanied minors and whether it has improved under Trump. Only the Acacia Center responded, and then only to repeat its point about paperwork.\n\n“This figure stems from gaps in ICE paperwork, not actual disappearances,” the center’s Deputy Chief of Programs Michael Corradini said. “Many children were never issued Notices to Appear in immigration court, so their absence from court records does not mean they are missing.”\n\nBut Vance’s total was not inaccurate, according to the inspector general’s report. It found that, in addition to the 32,000 cases in which no address was given for where the minor went, there were another 43,000 cases where the minor failed to respond to a summons to immigration court, and 233,000 cases where neither addresses nor phone numbers received a response. In other words, more than 300,000.\n\nThe $23 Billion Network that Flopped\n\nSince the DHS was created, most of the unaccompanied minors have been handled by the ORR. That agency, in turn, will release the minor to a sponsor, and it is at this point that the government often loses touch with the immigrant, several experts told RCI.\n\nNeither ORR nor those agencies above it – the Administration for Children and Families and the Department of Health & Human Services – responded to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThrough ORR, taxpayers spent $23.1 billion on unaccompanied minor-related grants and contracts during Biden’s term, according to usaspending.gov. The office relies on a sprawling network to house the migrant minors and put them together with sponsors. Contracts and grants related to unaccompanied minors comprise the biggest chunk of the office’s spending each year, accounting for more than 91% in FY2021. \n\nConstruction companies like Rapid Deployment Inc., of Mobile, Ala., were paid at least $3.5 billion, and nearly $200 million went to the defense contractor General Dynamics of Connecticut. Much of the funding went to nonprofits, religious charities, and non-governmental organizations that operate foster homes and release the minors to sponsors. Consulting companies, lawyers, and universities also benefited.\n\nDespite the big outlays of money, it seems no group of officials kept tabs on the minors. \n\nCongress has identified some misspending in the program. North Carolina Republican Rep. Dan Bishop said last November that more than $100 million was obligated, and nearly $40 million spent, for an unaccompanied minor home in Greensboro, N.C., that never housed anyone.\n\nAt least one major vendor, Southwest Key Programs Inc. in Texas, has been sued for mistreatment of minors. As the largest housing provider for unaccompanied children, the group received at least $2 billion over just three years, from FY2021 to FY2023, according to government records. Last summer, the Justice Department sued Southwest Key, alleging that for years “multiple Southwest Key employees subjected unaccompanied children in their care to repeated and unwelcome sexual abuse, harassment, and misconduct and a hostile housing environment, including severe sexual abuse and rape.”\n\nFederal tax returns for some of these nonprofits show that the ORR contracts and grants proved very lucrative. Southwest Key, for example, went from reporting revenues of $417.8 million in 2020 to more than $900 million in 2023 and 2024. In those last two years, the Austin-based nonprofit’s CEO, Anselmo Villarreal, was paid more than $1.1 million, while dozens of top executives received annual pay packages ranging from $250,000 to $700,000. In those same two years, Southwest Key spent 76% of its nearly $1 billion in revenue on “salaries, other compensation and benefits,” according to tax returns collected by ProPublica.\n\nEndeavors, a San Antonio-based nonprofit, was paid more than $2 billion, including a $1.3 billion contract in FY2022, and at least $720 million in the other three years of Biden’s term. According to an audit, the nonprofit had minuscule revenues from 2011 to 2020. In 2020, when the nonprofit reported $52.5 million in revenue, it had 10 executives making six figures, topped by CEO Jon Allman at $317,301. In 2023, those in the Endeavors’ C-suite fared even better, with CEO Charles H. Fulghum pulling down $638,472 and three other executives making between $390,000 and $493,000, tax records show.\n\nAnother San Antonio nonprofit, Compass Connections, grew exponentially through unaccompanied minor-related government deals worth nearly $700 million. Compass reported less than $300,000 in revenue for the years 2019 to 2021. Then Compass caught fire, reporting $192 million in revenue in 2023 and $434 million the following year. In 2023, its Chairman Kevin Dinnin received more than $1.3 million in compensation from Compass and related organizations, tax records show.\n\nSouthwest Key, Endeavors, and Compass didn’t respond to requests for comment on the services they provided. Other groups that received much smaller sums, such as the Vera Institute for Justice and the Los Angeles County Fair Association, also declined to reveal anything about how they helped the undocumented minors. \n\nThis prodigious spending appears to have come to a halt in FY2025, which ended last month. In that year, the ORR spent $51.9 million.\n\nSen. Grassley has also been stonewalled by these same groups when he sought information on their services, according to his office. Concerned about possible waste and fraud, Grassley wrote to two dozen contractors twice in 2024, and while some did not respond at all, those that did “provided incomplete and obstructive responses.”\n\n“It really is horrific, what’s been going on,” said Lederer, the former government advisor. “Unfortunately, we usually only learn about it when a child is rescued or is hurt badly. The people that facilitated all this have circled the wagons about what went very, very wrong.”","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/out-sight-following-money-trail-missing-child-border-crossers","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2025-12/703901_80.jpg?h=c4f2bdb3&amp;itok=LRbSgtjj","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 02:00:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.567},{"id":385802234,"title":"Paramount was poised to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. What went wrong?","text":"Oracle founder Larry Ellison was on the cusp of conquering Hollywood. Just four months earlier, he had bankrolled his son David's $8-billion acquisition of the storied Paramount Pictures. Now the Ellison family had designs on scooping up Warner Bros. Discovery, too, offering to buy the entire company for at least $60 billion. The bold play had suddenly thrust this Silicon Valley titan and his son, David — chief executive of the newly-merged Paramount Skydance — into one of the most powerful positions in the film and TV industry. By most outward appearances, Warner Bros. Discovery was theirs for the taking. Wall Street analysts, Hollywood insiders and even some of the other bidders expected Paramount to prevail. After all, it was backed by one of the world's richest men. And it even had the blessing of President Trump, who openly expressed his preference for the Paramount bid. But Ellison's crowning moment was ruined when Netflix swooped in Friday announcing its own blockbuster deal. The streamer snapped up Warner Bros. in a $82.7-billion deal for the Burbank-based film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO, delivering a massive blow to Ellison and his son, David. In the Paramount bid, Larry Ellison was once again the primary backer. But the Warner Bros. Discovery board believed the Netflix offer of $27.75 a share, which did not include CNN or other basic cable channels, was a better deal for shareholders. The announcement stunned many who had predicted that Paramount would prevail in the contentious auction. It also marked a rare defeat for Ellison, who was outmaneuvered by none other than Netflix's co-Chief Executive Ted Sarandos and his team. Analysts and multiple auction insiders told The Times several factors complicated the process, including Paramount's low-ball offers and hubris. \"This is a bad day for for Paramount and for the Ellisons,\" said Lloyd Greif, president and chief executive of Greif & Co., a Los Angeles-based investment bank. \"They were overconfident because they underestimated the competition.\" Representatives of Paramount and Warner declined to comment. A representative for Ellison at Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. Characteristically, Ellison is not backing down, say sources close to the tech mogul who were not authorized to comment. Paramount — whose chief legal counsel is the former head of the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division during the first Trump term — is preparing for a legal battle with Warner Bros. over the handling of the auction. They are expected to urge the Securities & Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice to investigate claims that the Netflix deal would be anticompetitive and harmful to consumers and theater owners. Paramount's lawyers sent Warner Bros. Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav a blistering letter Wednesday, accusing the studio of rigging the process in favor of a \"single bidder\" and \"abdicating its duties to stockholders.\" Several sources said Paramount’s first mistake was making low-ball offers. Paramount submitted three unsolicited bids by mid-October, the first for $19 a share. Warner’s board of directors unanimously rejected all of the bids as too low. Top Warner Bros. executives were incensed, feeling that the Ellisons had just shown up in Hollywood and now were throwing their weight around to take advantage of Warner Bros.' struggles. Paramount had Larry Ellison guaranteeing its Warner bid with $30 billion of his Oracle stock, according to one knowledgeable person who was not authorized to comment. But as the price of Warner went higher, Paramount needed considerably more money. It turned to private equity firm Apollo Global Management. In late October, Warner opened the bidding to other suitors. Netflix and Comcast jumped in. Paramount’s leaders seemed to underestimate Netflix, according to several people close to the auction. A senior Netflix executive had publicly downplayed its interest. “Maybe Netflix was playing possum,” said Paul Hardart, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. Paramount \"thought they were the only game in town,” said a person close to the auction who was not authorized to comment. At one point, Paramount’s team seemed more concerned about the movements of Comcast Chairman Brian Roberts, who had visited Saudi Arabia, reportedly on theme park business. David Ellison and RedBird’s Gerry Cardinale were scrambling to line up Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds to provide more financing for their offer. “They were going around trying to get money from elsewhere and that probably sowed some doubts among the board at Warner Bros. Discovery,” Hardart said. Paramount's negotiations with wealth funds for Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were widely noted, people close to the auction said. “It invited skepticism of the strength of the Paramount commitment,” said C. Kerry Fields, a business law professor at the USC Marshall School of Business. When Oracle stock started dropping amid concerns of an AI bubble, it left Paramount's bid in a more precarious position. In Hollywood, Larry Ellison's close ties to Trump dampened enthusiasm for Paramount's bid. Oracle is among a group of U.S. investors expected to hold a majority stake in the U.S. business of TikTok, after the hugely popular video sharing app is spun out from Chinese parent company ByteDance — in no small part due to the influence and support from Trump. This summer, Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to settle Trump’s lawsuit against CBS for its edits of a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris, as it was seeking to gain regulatory approval for the Ellison Skydance takeover. Days later, Paramount's CBS announced that it was ending Stephen Colbert’s late-night talk show, citing its financial losses. David Ellison in October made a controversial hire of the Free Press founder Bari Weiss to run CBS News — which delighted the president. “Larry Ellison is great, and his son, David, is great,” Trump told reporters in mid-October. “They’re big supporters of mine.” After Trump’s reported intervention, Paramount agreed in late November to distribute Brett Ratner’s “Rush Hour 4,” a project that had been shelved amid sexual assault allegations against the director highlighted in a Los Angeles Times report. Ratner has disputed all the allegations against him. “They were in the pole position with the Trump administration, but then that [position] started to be not as appealing to people,” Hardart said. Last month, there was a meeting at the White House to discuss Paramount’s bid and the threat of Netflix, sources said. That same week, David Ellison was among the guests at a White House dinner hosted by Trump for Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. A report in the Guardian also raised alarm bells among some foreign regulators, one knowledgeable person said. The newspaper reported, citing anonymous sources, that White House officials had informally discussed with Larry Ellison several female CNN anchors whom Trump disliked and wanted fired should Paramount succeed in buying Warner. People close to Paramount contend that Zaslav and his mentor, John Malone, who serves as a Warner board member emeritus, were biased against Paramount and that Zaslav is angling to retain his mogul status. Paramount ultimately submitted six offers to Warner, including a final $30 a share offer, but none were as strong as Netflix’s proposal, said two people involved with the auction. Paramount executives knew last Monday that they had been bested, according to people close to the company. Two days later, they lobbed a missive at Warner: “WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process,\" Paramount's lawyers wrote. Netflix said Friday its deal won't close for a year to 18 months, the anticipated time it will take to win regulatory approval. That's far from guaranteed, however, given possible antitrust concerns over Netflix's market dominance. Now Warner Bros. Discovery is girding for a fight over its handling of the auction. Until recently, Larry Ellison was perhaps best known in Hollywood circles for playing himself in an “Iron Man 2” cameo during which Tony Stark refers to him as the \"Oracle of Oracle\" — and as the father who quietly bankrolled the film business careers of his children, David and Megan. Those who know Larry Ellison say he should not be counted out. At 81, a determined and resolute Ellison has shown no signs of slowing down. Although he stepped down as Oracle's CEO in 2014, he remains its executive chairman and chief technology officer — and continues to be deeply involved in the company and its growing tentacles. “He keeps reinventing the company. Right when you think that they can't figure it out, they figure it out and they're pretty resilient,” said Brent Thill, a tech analyst at Jefferies. The son of a 19-year-old unwed mother, Ellison grew up in a modest walk-up apartment on Chicago’s South Side, where he was raised by her aunt and uncle. As he told Fox Business, \"I had all the disadvantages necessary for success.\" Smart and headstrong, Ellison attended the University of Chicago, but dropped out and drove to California in a used Thunderbird. He got a job as a bank computer programmer, the first of several computer jobs at various companies. In the early 1970s, Ellison began working on early databases for a company called Ampex. As the story goes, it became the precursor to Oracle’s systems. By 1977, Ellison co-founded Oracle with $1,200 and ideas deeply inspired by an IBM research paper. The start-up transformed how companies and organizations stored, managed and retrieved huge volumes of data. The software company quickly became an influential tech giant. Oracle’s first contract was with the CIA. In 1986, Oracle went public and seven years later Ellison landed for the first time on Forbes billionaire’s list, with a net worth of $1.6 billion. Even among the ego-driven billionaire eccentrics of Silicon Valley, Ellison stood out. “The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison\" is the title of a 1997 biography — one of at least 10 tomes examining the life of Larry. Unlike many of his tech titan peers, who preferred quiet pursuits and carefully crafted public personas, Ellison reveled in his flamboyant escapades and the attention it attracted. Ellison has flown fighter jets for fun, won the America’s Cup, twice (in 2010 and 2013), collected super yachts, mansions and samurai swords. As both Oracle’s and Ellison’s fortunes swelled, he earned a reputation for ruthlessness. For years, his archnemesis was Microsoft founder Bill Gates. During the rival’s antitrust trial in 2000, Ellison not only admitted to hiring private investigators to go through Microsoft’s garbage but he also defended his actions, calling the move his “civic duty.” Mike Wilson, one of Ellison’s biographers, called him \"the Charles Foster Kane of the technological age.\" At Oracle, Ellison pushed to expand into cloud computing, healthcare and, more recently, artificial intelligence, forging close partnerships with AI chipmaking behemoth Nvidia, Meta and xAI. Hollywood, however, was the domain of Ellison’s children, David and Megan, whom he had with his third wife, Barbara Boothe. They divorced shortly after Megan was born. The Ellison scions grew up with their mother on a horse farm in Woodside, in the San Francisco Bay Area, and spent time with their father during school breaks, sailing around the world on one of his super yachts. Early on, the tech entrepreneur set up trusts for his children with large tranches of stock in Oracle and later NetSuite, an enterprise software company he helped finance, that went public in 2007. Over time, the trusts, in addition to their independent holdings, have made David and Megan phenomenally wealthy. With Ellison’s deep pockets, both pursued filmmaking. Megan launched Annapurna, an indie production company behind such acclaimed movies as “Zero Dark Thirty” and “Her.” David, after a brief, unsuccessful stint as an actor and producer of the 2006 flop \"Flyboys,\" established Skydance Media, bankrolling a slew of massive box office and television hits such as “Top Gun: Maverick,” “Star Trek” and “Grace and Frankie,” later broadening into animation, sports and gaming. “David made money, his sister made the art,” said Stephen Galloway, dean of Chapman University's Dodge College of Film and Media Arts. And Larry Ellison often stepped in. In 2018, he shepherded a major reorganization of Annapurna after the company stumbled into hundreds of millions in losses amid several box office misfires. It was Ellison who put up the bulk of his son’s $8-billion bid to buy Paramount, the iconic studio, as well as CBS, MTV and other properties — and he holds nearly 78% of the newly formed company’s stock, making him its largest shareholder. The Ellison family announced plans to remake the fabled Paramount studio through major investments, leveraging technology and building on popular franchises including “Top Gun,” “Star Trek” and “Yellowstone.” And they aren't ready to walk away from Warner Bros. If history has proven anything, Ellison is always up for a fight.

Oh, and for ending wars “just right before they started,” according to Trump himself. These were, Infantino said, “exceptional actions taken in the cause of world peace.”\n\nSocial media lit up immediately after the peace prize announcement with a tsunami of scorn and derision.\n\n“Awarding the first Fifa peace prize to a man who’s fuelled so much hate and violence is flat out shameful,” wrote one. “Fifa Peace Prize for the guy about to invade a country and is killing people in international waters with no proof?” asked another, referring to Trump’s threats to attack Venezuela and unseat its president, Nicolas Maduro. “What is next? mocked a third. “The Lawn Tennis Association Prize for Physics?”\n\nIn his short speech, Trump claimed to have “saved millions of lives,” rambled on about ticket sales, praised Infantino and thanked his wife. He closed by boasting that while the country was not doing so well a year ago, now “we’re the hottest country anywhere in the world”. He was perhaps forgetting that the US is actually co-hosting the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, both of which Trump has threatened to invade or annex and whose leaders were also present for the draw.\n\nAccording to this newly crowned man of peace and his cabinet, those fleeing to the United States from wars or repression are “dangerous criminals that are murderers, rapists, money launderers” leading to “a lot of bad genes in our country right now.”\n\nSomalis living in the US are “garbage” and their country “stinks,” being a place where “they just run around killing each other.”\n\nIn New Orleans, immigration officials must “target the violent criminal illegal aliens that sanctuary politicians have allowed to roam free.”\n\nThe citizens of countries that have been “flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies,” will no longer be able to travel to the US.\n\nA Palestinian-US teenager from Florida, Mohammed Ibrahim, was left to waste away in an Israeli prison for nine months after being seized from his West Bank home, while the Trump administration did nothing.\n\n“Kill everybody” is the go-to policy when unidentified small boats in Caribbean waters appear headed toward US shores.\n\nAnd yes, back in 2017, some of those white supremacists marching to “Unite the Right” in Charlottesville and chanting “Jews will not replace us” — one of whom murdered a counterprotester by running her down with his vehicle — were “very fine people.”\n\nThe Trump version of caring about the people has been to follow up that hateful rhetoric with Gestapo-like actions, including raids on homes and businesses, with families dragged from their beds in the middle of the night by armed, masked immigration officers, and people snatched in the street or seized in front of their nursery class.\n\nAs for peace, the killings, disease and famine continue in Gaza. The rapes and murders have not ceased in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Russian war in Ukraine drags on unabated. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi flatly dismissed Trump’s peace-brokering claim, saying “No world leader asked us to stop the operation.”\n\nThe Gaza “peace plan” is a Trump real estate grab. The Congo-Rwanda peace plan is a Trump minerals grab. The Russia-Ukraine conflict is a bonanza for Trump’s friends in the US weapons manufacturing business, as is the Gaza genocide.\n\nBut all this, according to Fifa, merited a peace prize? Well, perhaps not according to Fifa, because despite having its name on the prize, no-one actually seems to know — or certainly won’t divulge — who in Fifa decided to create the prize, who the candidates were, if any, and who chose the winner. Infantino announced the award as the “first annual,” so some transparency around the selection process is now long overdue.\n\nThe only certainty is that the first set of fingerprints on that trophy belonged to Infantino, even before he strode onto the Kennedy Centre stage to award it to Trump. The Fifa president has been fawning all over Trump ever since he was elected to a second presidential term back in November 2023, and repeated that sycophancy on Friday, promising Trump “you can always count on my support and the support of the entire football community or soccer community.”\n\nThe Fifa peace prize was also awarded to Trump on the basis of his having “championed the unifying power of football,” evidence for which is about as elusive as the criteria underpinning the award itself.\n\nHuman rights groups had repeatedly asked Fifa for information on the prize. In a November 11 letter to Infantino, Human Rights Watch demanded to know the criteria for selection, who had been nominated, what the qualifications for winning were and the identity of the judges. “We did not have an answer to that, which you could infer that there is no process, there are no other nominees, there was no judgement,” said the group’s director of global initiatives, Minky Worden.\n\nA coalition of trade union, media and humanitarian groups has also been pushing Fifa to ensure that human and civil rights are at the forefront in the upcoming World Cup. There are concerns about the treatment of workers, censorship of the press, homophobia, and now, especially in the US, the ability for fans from other countries to travel to the US, including two of the teams that qualified — Iran and Haiti — whose citizens are currently under a US travel ban.\n\nCitizens from 12 countries are already banned from entering the US and seven other countries face restrictions. But recent statements from the Trump administration suggest that number could increase to as many as 36 countries.\n\nAfter relocating the draw ceremony from Las Vegas to the more politically convenient showcase of DC’s Kennedy Centre, an institution where Trump has already installed himself as president, the US president has now threatened to remove World Cup matches from US host cities that are “run by radical left-wing lunatics.”\n\nDuring the live broadcast of the draw ceremony extravaganza, Haitian singer and rapper Wyclef Jean, seated in the audience, was introduced as a representative of his country. Needless to say, he was not asked what he thought of Trump’s Haiti travel ban, nor Trump calling Haiti a “s—-hole” country. Most memorably, during a debate on the campaign trail with Democratic contender Kamala Harris, Trump also accused Haitians living in Ohio of “eating the dogs. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.”\n\nTrump now has another giant gold bauble — described by one wag on X as “seemingly a depiction of severed hands pulling the earth into Hell” — to display in the already gilded-up Oval Office. He also received a medal, which he couldn’t wait to hang around his own neck, and a certificate proclaiming him a man of peace and a “dynamic leader engaged in diplomatic opportunities, de-escalation and stability.”\n\nIn Trump’s own words, “The world is a safer place now,” all thanks to him and a phony Fifa peace prize that says it is so.\n\nLinda Pentz Gunter is a writer living in Takoma Park, Maryland.","url":"https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/article/no-surprise-phony-fifa-peace-prize-goes-trump","image":"https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/wide/public/2025-12/AP25339636160216.jpg.webp?itok=8cFvqwh-","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-07 00:00:00","author":"Linda Pentz Gunter","authors":["Linda Pentz Gunter"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.018},{"id":385733524,"title":"'Complicit' Taylor Swift Draws Criticism for Not Joining Sabrina Carpenter, Olivia Rodrigo in Condemning White House","text":"Taylor Swift is facing renewed criticism for her lack of public response after the White House used one of her songs in a promotional video. The silence has drawn sharp comparisons to other major artists, like Sabrina Carpenter and Olivia Rodrigo, who immediately demanded their music be removed from similar content.This placed a spotlight on Swift, with observers noting why the pop superstar has not voiced opposition or taken action. The White House TikTok video featuring her 'The Fate of Ophelia' track remains online. This fact has renewed discussion about Swift's lack of reaction after the recent incident involving the Please Please Please hitmaker.What's the Excuse, Taylor Swift?TikTok creator Kahlen Barry is among those who have called out Taylor Swift for her silence. In a video, Barry contrasted Swift's lack of reaction with the immediate public statements from Sabrina Carpenter and Olivia Rodrigo after the White House used their songs in videos promoting ICE.'So if you're still defending Taylor Swift and the way that she's been moving with this current administration, I know something about you,' Barry began. The creator pointed out that Swift is a much bigger star than Carpenter and Rodrigo combined, yet she has remained silent.'So at this point, I'm sorry. What is the excuse?' Barry asked. 'What is the excuse for Taylor Swift, who is more powerful than both of them, honestly, combined?' Barry expressed disbelief at Swift's silence, particularly given her public battle for ownership of her music, only to be 'complicit when people are using her music to fuel a very disgusting and harmful agenda.'A Contrast in ResponsesWhen Olivia Rodrigo and Sabrina Carpenter discovered the White House was using their songs, they both issued swift and forceful public rebukes.'Don't ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda,' Rodrigo reportedly wrote in a since-deleted comment on a video promoting self-deportation. Shortly after, the audio on the video was removed.Carpenter had a similar reaction after her song 'Juno' was used to promote ICE deportations. She called the video 'Evil and Disgusting' and stated, 'Do Not Involve Me in Your Inhumane Agenda.' The White House subsequently deleted that video.The TikTok video using Swift's song, 'The Fate of Ophelia,' remains accessible. The White House used a clip of the song, ending the video with the caption 'The fate of America.'History of Public FeudThe silence surprised many, given Swift's public feud with Donald Trump. In her 2020 documentary Miss Americana, her publicist warned her that Trump might come after her for speaking out politically, to which she replied, 'F**k that. I don't care.'Swift later endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 national election. In response, Trump reportedly took to social media and wrote, 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT.'

Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna recently blasted the governor for his online antics during an appearance on the PBD Podcast.\n\nHost Patrick Bet-David noted, “You’re either a great troll or you’re trying to be. Like Newsom is dying to be Trump, but he’s not. Newsom is trying to be Trump. Newsom’s not Trump, right? Nowhere near him. But everything he does, he’s trying to be — the Trump of the left.”\n\nLuna recounted a joke she made on a Comedy Central show: “I was on a show recently. I think it was on Comedy Central, it was like an evening talk show. And they’re talking about the ‘No Kings’ protests and I made a joke and I was like, ‘Well if you’re talking about Gavin Newsom it would be the ‘No Queens’ protest.’”\n\nWhen asked if it was homophobic, she replied, “No he [Newsom] just has feminine tendencies, and it’s totally true. I don’t know, like — he bitches on the internet all the time. It’s like what are you doing, Gavin? You know, you have fires in the Palisades — what’s going on?”\n\nBet-David agreed, calling Newsom’s vibe “metro.”\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, actress Halle Berry stunned the DealBook crowd earlier that day by slamming Newsom for vetoing a menopause care bill twice, questioning his fitness for higher office.\n\n“Back in my great state of California, my very own governor, Gavin Newsom, has vetoed our menopause bill, not one, but 2 years in a row! But that’s OK, because he’s not GOING to be governor forever!” Berry urged.\n\nShe continued, “With the way he’s overlooked women, half the population, by devaluing us in midlife, he probably should not be our next president either! Just saying!”\n\nBerry rallied the audience, stressing “I need every woman in this country to fight with me. But the truth is, the fight isn’t just for us women. We need men too. We need all of the leaders, every single one of you in this room. This fight needs you.”\n\n? HOLY CRAP!

Berry’s raw callout drew gasps, underscoring how even Hollywood elites are turning on him amid whispers of his 2028 aspirations.\n\nNewsom’s “normalcy” sermon exposes the Democrats’ desperation after years of pushing radical agendas on gender ideology, unchecked immigration, and climate hysteria that have alienated the heartland. \n\nIf this is their comeback strategy—masking extremism while California burns—good luck selling that to voters who’ve had enough of the chaos.

Eric Swalwell (D-CA-14) throwing his hat into the California governor's race has been bad news for former Congresswoman Katie Porter. According to the latest Emerson College poll, she is sinking like a stone.\n\nFormer Rep. Katie Porter is sinking in the polls as the race to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom gets downright claustrophobic. Support for Porter, the former Orange County congresswoman who’s been labeled a tyrant by a former staffer and her ex-husband, has slipped to 11% of voters surveyed by Emerson College in a new poll released Thursday.The poll suggests splintering support for Porter and others in the crowded primary field after the entry of East Bay Rep. Eric Swalwell and Tom Steyer, the billionaire climate activist.\n\nSince October we have watched as the egregious Porter's campaign to become California's first female governor has had one oppo hit after another. Video drops of her behavior toward press and staffers show just how entitled and volatile she becomes when put on the spot, confronted with tough questions, or asked follow-up questions. \n\nRead More: Toxic Katie Porter Goes From Bad to Worse, Pathetically Tries to Explain Abusive Videos\n\nHer horrible treatment of her staffers and her ex-husband further show that she is not just a terrible candidate, but a pretty awful human. Porter is also not well-liked by her own party. California Democrat Party elders, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA-11), are definitely not Team Porter. \n\nThe Bay Area Cabal opposes Porter because she is not a team player. In 2023 Porter preempted the late Senator Dianne Feinstein, then 89 years old, announcing her senate campaign. Feinstein’s forced retirement offended Feinstein and the Democrat establishment that only whispered Feinstein’s health had been declining for a decade, when they first offered to Feinstein to again run for governor in 2010 and open her seat for Newsom. Her colleague, former Senator Barbara Boxer is also from the Bay, retired in 2016 and was succeeded by Harris.Porter’s additional offenses are enumerated by former Democrat Representative Harley Rouda in the Orange County Register. In addition to describing Porter as an abusive self-centered “bully with a white board,” Rouda criticized Porter for barely winning a seat redistricted for her, costing Democrats a congressional seat in Los Angeles (CA-27; Loss), and potentially two more in Orange County (CA-47; Hold and SD-37; Loss). As one of the most junior of the elderly California delegation, and a competitive district, Porter was supposed to “wait her turn.”Above all Porter does not follow orders. Speaker Emerita Pelosi is the party boss, was close to Feinstein, and selected then Representative Adam Schiff as Feinstein’s successor. Although a backbencher from Southern California, Schiff was senior, his seat safe, and gained prominence opposing the first Trump Administration. Porter eventually finished third for U.S. Senate with 15% of the vote and then broke silence against California’s “rigged” political machine that included Schiff promoting Republican Steve Garvey.\n\nIt is almost a surety that CA Dems greenlit all of the oppo hits against Porter. When that didn't tank her enough, Swalwell entered the race in order to be a spoiler, and he's doing a great job of curdling the milk. \n\nDespite Pelosi having the reins on party leadership, there is also an underlying misogyny that exists in the CA Democrat Party, especially among the donor class. Look at how they have treated their star: former Vice President and presidential candidate Kamala Harris versus current CA Gov. Gavin Newsom. Both politicians have been absolute disasters, failed up in every position given them, and while both are progressive stalwarts, when it comes to persuading the general electorate that they care about things that actually matter to them, they are absolute disasters. Yet one person continues to be platformed and propped up as the 2028 Democrat nominee for president, while the other keeps getting pushed to the margins, despite refusing to go gently into that good night.\n\nI guess Swalwell can enjoy today, but folks know he slept with many of his interns while married, sexually harassed others while engaged, has a ton of weird texts late at night saved on former interns phones still, he gets he will have to answer for his later on during the campaign, right? Endorse at your own peril people. Yo [sic] have been fully warned, just doing my public service today.\n\nThe facts: Swalwell has zero chance of being the Democrat nominee for California governor, and even less chance of beating Republican Steve Hilton or Sheriff Chad Bianco. His alleged affair with Chinese spy Fang Fang notwithstanding, the man is more of a walking oppo dump than Porter. But the fact that this awkward, personality-devoid, pervy spy dupe has bypassed Porter in the polls is not only telling, but an indicator of the crisis that exists in the Democrat Party.\n\nIf things continue in this vein, California may just elect a Republican governor after all.\n\nEditor's Note: The mainstream media continues to deflect, gaslight, spin, and lie about President Trump, his administration, and conservatives.\n\nHelp us continue to expose their left-wing bias by reading news you can trust.

but it's still bad news for Trump","text":"When Mark Green announced his retirement from politics, it seemed to his Republican colleagues that refilling the seat would be an easy feat.\n\nTennessee, and its newly vacant 7th congressional district, were firmly red strongholds.\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, Donald Trump won the district by 22 points.\n\nThe last time Green went to an election, almost 60 per cent of voters cast their ballots for him.\n\nIndeed, a Democrat had not been elected to represent the 7th district in more than 40 years.\n\nSo when Matt Van Epps, a former commissioner of the Tennessee Department of General Services, was chosen as the Republican candidate for the ensuing by-election, he seemed a shoo-in.\n\nThe race did not quite pan out that way.\n\nVan Epps did win when Tennessee went to the polls on Tuesday, but with a margin of just nine points, it did not come easy.\n\nA high-stakes election\n\nThe special election, as it is called in the US, was the first for federal office since Democrats stormed to numerous victories on November 4.\n\nSelf-described democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani had a blistering rise to New York mayor.\n\nIn Virginia and New Jersey's governorship races, the Democratic Party increased its winning margins from the presidential election a year prior.\n\nWith the 2026 midterm elections fast approaching, pundits were tipping the Republican Party's narrow majority in the House of Representatives was at risk.\n\nAll the while, Trump's net approval rating had been sliding downward.\n\nRepublicans saw Tennessee as an opportunity to change the storyline.\n\nEnter: Aftyn Behn\n\nIf the November elections had left Republicans uneasy, Democrats walked away hungry for more.\n\nThe party was eyeing even rusted-on red areas.\n\nTheir woman in the Tennessee race was Aftyn Behn: a 36-year-old member of the Tennessee House of Representatives who described herself as a \"pissed-off social worker\".\n\nTrump called her the \"AOC of Tennessee\".\n\nHe meant it as a sledge drawing parallels between Behn and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's democratic socialist brand of leftism.\n\nBehn, who supported democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential primary, focused on expanding Medicaid and lowering the cost of living through initiatives like eliminating a state tax on groceries.\n\nBut the similarities between her and AOC cut deeper.\n\nOcasio-Cortez is one of the left's most influential leaders, capable of mobilising young voters with a progressive platform — something Behn proved adept at, too.\n\n\"If you are upset about the cost of living and the chaos of Washington, we are your campaign.\"\n\nDemocratic political strategist Ian Russell said while a \"more moderate candidate\" might have performed better in a general election, Behn was the woman \"for the moment\".\n\n\"What Aftyn is able to put together is a coalition of the pissed off — people who are not happy with what they're getting out of Washington, frustrated with the direction that the country is going, frustrated primarily with what they're seeing every time they go to the grocery store or look at their health insurance premiums,\" he told political journalist Abby Livingston.\n\nPolling showed the cost of living would be a defining issue at the election and in that area, Behn was performing well.\n\nThe Republican Party was worried.\n\n'The whole world is watching'\n\nMid-term elections always draw a smaller crowd of voters, and the unique timing of this race (just after Thanksgiving) threatened both candidates' chances if they didn't rally their supporters effectively.\n\n\"I'm very concerned that we could be caught with our pants down,\" Republican representative Tim Burchett of Tennessee said during the campaign.\n\nAs election day — and polling margins — drew closer, both major parties fell into a tit-for-tat competition.\n\nRepublican super political action committees(PACs), which help fund political campaigns, tipped $US3.1 million ($4.68 million) into Van Epps's campaign.\n\nDemocratic-aligned PACs gave $US2.3 million to Behn's.\n\nFormer vice-president Kamala Harris appeared at one of Behn's get-out-the-vote rallies.\n\nTrump called in to several of Van Epps's.\n\n\"The whole world is watching Tennessee right now, and they're watching the district,\" the president said on one call.\n\nBehn was acutely aware of the exceptional attention paid to Tennessee's 7th congressional district, too.\n\n\"I never thought I'd see national attention devoted to a race like this,\" she told the American Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nOne week out from election day, polling suggested Van Epps might have been in trouble.\n\nThe survey of 600 people by Emerson College Polling and The Hill found 48 per cent voter support for Van Epps. Behn was only two points behind.\n\nWith a 3.9 per cent margin of error, it appeared the election was truly a dead heat.\n\nBut those voting early broke for Behn 56 per cent to 42 per cent.\n\nRepublicans tend to prefer voting on election day itself, and Van Epps would need to rely on this turnout to cinch the win.\n\nCelebrating a loss\n\nWearing a cornflower blue western-style rhinestone shirt and pants, Behn took the stage at an event space in the heart of Nashville the night of election day.\n\nDolly Parton's 9 to 5 rang out from speakers beneath cheers from a raucous crowd.\n\nThe Democrat beamed and waved to her supporters.\n\n\"Oh, my goodness, thank you, thank you, thank you,\" she said.\n\nOne could have easily mistaken this for a victory party.\n\nIn the end, Republicans managed to hold onto the reliably conservative seat — a feat attributed to the late and aggressive burst of national spending to the tune of $US4 million and high-profile campaigning.\n\nBut the winning margin was less than half of Green's 21-point lead in 2024.\n\nIt was this point that Democrats celebrated.\n\n\"That Nashville turned out is a testament to not only my candidacy and the campaign we've built, but also Black voters and Nashville,\" she gushed as supporters danced to upbeat tunes behind her.\n\nVan Epps took the night to celebrate his win.\n\n\"We are grateful to the president for his unwavering support that charted this movement and catapulted us to victory,\" Van Epps said in his victory speech.\n\n\"President Trump was all-in with us. That made the difference. In Congress, I'll be all-in with him.\"\n\nBut that same night, some of his Republican colleagues had already begun a post-mortem.\n\n\"We could have lost this district,\" Senator Ted Cruz told Fox News after the race was called.\n\nThe outcome cast a gloomy outlook for Republicans going into the 2026 mid-terms.\n\nPundits say the party will need to defend more vulnerable seats than usual if they are to have any hope of keeping the House majority.\n\n\"The danger signs are there, and we shouldn't have had to spend that kind of money to hold that kind of seat,\" said Jason Roe, a national Republican strategist working on several of next year's battleground races.\n\nCruz said his party had to \"set out the alarm bells\" because next year was \"going to be a turnout election and the left will show up\".","summary":"A Republican claimed a win at a by-election in Tennessee this week, but his party colleagues are sounding alarm bells.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-12-07/tennessee-special-election-van-epps-behn/106106326","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b0b0c1add7e589ba960a0adc5ab6695d?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=39&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 19:18:52","author":"Elissa Steedman","authors":["Elissa Steedman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.101},{"id":385823714,"title":"Illinois legislator credits Trump for U.S. Steel announcement","text":"“We’re just thrilled that we think the entire region really will benefit economically from that, from increased traffic through Granite City and increased traffic and all those supporting organizations,” Elik told The Center Square. \n\nU.S. Steel President and CEO David Burritt said the decision came after “carefully analyzing customer demand” and confidence in the company’s ability “to safely and profitably operate the mill.” \n\n“We look forward to partnering with all stakeholders, including the United Steelworkers and elected officials, to ensure a safe and efficient start-up and to discuss support for Granite City Works,” Burritt said in a statement. \n\nElik said it’s great news. \n\n“This is not something that is going to be up for two weeks and then closed again,” she said. “It’s going to take a couple of months for things to get rolling again.

Leavitt, 28, did not share any of her top songs or albums of the year, so it is unclear what Swift Era she has been jamming to all year long.\nHer apparent Swiftie status comes in the wake of numerous online attacks aimed toward Swift by the current commander in chief.\nAfter Swift endorsed the then-Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, Trump posted, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” on his social media platform, Truth Social.\nIn May 2025, Trump again took aim at Swift online in apparent attack on her looks.\n“Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’”\nIn August, however, after Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce announced their engagement via social media, Trump seemed to soften his tone and general attitude towards the pop star.\n“I wish them a lot of luck,” the president said during a Cabinet meeting at the time. “I think he’s a great player and a great guy, and I think she’s a terrific person, so I wish them a lot of luck.”\nAnd on November 2, the White House went so far as to use Swift’s song, “The Fate of Ophelia,” off her latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, in a clip shared via its official TikTok channel. The clip featured a photo of President Trump’s 2023 mugshot, in which she was indicted on charges related to efforts to overthrow the 2020 presidential election, as Swift sang,”Don’t care where the hell you been.”\n“OUR VIBES,” the White House captioned the post, which also featured a clip of the president hugging and kissing the American flag as Swift sang, “Cause now you’re mine.”\nSwift, who is notorious for being litigious when it comes to the unauthorized use of her music or likeness, has yet to publicly respond to the White House’s use of her music.\nOther artists, however, have been extremely vocal in their opposition to the Trump administration using their music without their explicit, authorized consent. Most recently, singer Sabrina Carpenter — who joined Swift on her history-making Eras tour — responded to the Trump administration using her song “Juno” in a 21-second video to promote the administration’s deportation efforts.\n“This video is evil and disgusting,” Carpenter, 26, wrote via X on Tuesday, December 2. “Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit our inhumane agenda.” h\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson later defended the video and its content in a statement to US Weekly.\n“Here’s a Short n’ Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter: we won’t apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists and pedophiles from our country,” Jackson told Us on Tuesday. “Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?”\n(According to the Cato Institute, 93 percent of individuals detained and booked in ICE detention centers have not been convicted of a violent crime, and nearly two-thirds have no criminal conviction at all.)\nThe administration has since removed the video from the platform.","url":"https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/taylor-swift-appears-on-karoline-leavitt-spotify-wrapped-after-attacks/","image":"https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/taylor-swift-on-white-house-press-sec-spotify-wrapped-list.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1200%2C675&quality=62&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 17:32:27","author":"Danielle Campoamor","authors":["Danielle Campoamor"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.207},{"id":385675776,"title":"Jane Fonda says Warner Bros.

Discovery or its parts, the resulting impact is clear: Consolidation at this scale would be catastrophic for an industry built on free expression, for the creative workers who power it, and for consumers who depend on a free, independent media ecosystem to understand the world. It will mean fewer jobs, fewer opportunities to sell work, fewer creative risks, fewer news sources and far less diversity in the stories Americans get to hear.\" As noted in Netflix's Friday statement, the streaming giant has purchased only the studio side of the company, as well as HBO and HBO Max. The cable news side of Warner Bros. Discovery, including CNN, TNT and Discovery, will be separated into its own publicly traded company, Discovery Global. Continuing her criticisms, Fonda claimed that whichever company acquires Warner Bros. Discovery would \"gain the power to steamroll every guild — SAG-AFTRA, the WGA, the PGA, the DGA, IATSE, everyone — making it harder for workers to bargain, harder to stand up for themselves and harder to make a living at all.\" The actress cautioned that no matter how dangerous the \"economic fallout\" might be, that is not what frightens her most about the sale.

Eric Swalwell tied for second place with 12%. Former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, the scandal-plagued former frontrunner in the race, came in fourth place with 11%, followed by former Democratic Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa at 5%, and billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer and former Biden-era Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Xavier Becerra each tied with 4% support.

Gavin Newsom, the Emerson College survey found.\n\n New Emerson College Poll shows possibility of top two lockout for Democrats in 2026 California Governor race >>> https://t.co/DQigSlxUBS pic.twitter.com/dAuKVYqD6m — Jacob Rubashkin (@JacobRubashkin) December 4, 2025 \n\nThere being two Republican candidates with name recognition in the race amid a muddled Democratic field amounts to a “perfect storm,” Bianco told the DCNF.\n\n“It just worked out that way,” the sheriff reflected to the outlet during an interview. “In the beginning of my campaign, when we were trying to decide if we were going to do this, we knew that there were already a dozen prominent Democrats in the race, so we knew that there was the possibility of a Democrat or two Republicans mathematically being in the top two. So, when I announced, there were no other Republican candidates, and then shortly after that, Steve [Hilton] announces.”\n\nHilton told the DCNF in a separate interview that, while “there is a theoretical possibility” he and Bianco will both advance to the general election, he does not think that will be the case as California Democrats “simply won’t allow that to happen.”\n\n“In political reality, the chances of that actually happening are zero. There is no way that the Democrats will allow their field to be so fractured that they will be shut out of the general election in the biggest state in America that they feel they have a right to run,” Hilton said. “There’s no way that the scenario that some people are talking about will come to pass. … There will be one Republican in the general election, and I’m very confident that that will be me.”\n\nBianco conversely argued that, “when you look at it legitimately, numbers-wise, mathematically,” an all-Republican 2026 general election matchup in deep blue California “can happen.”\n\n“What this really shows is the Democrat Party is in shambles. They have no leadership,” he told the DCNF, referring to the apparent lack of a Democratic frontrunner. “If you look back in history, there’s always a secession plan. There’s always someone else in line. That’s how Newsom got in there.”\n\nThe current California governor served as lieutenant governor under his predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, from January 2011 to January 2019.\n\n“But the problem for them [Democrats] now is Newsom is the biggest narcissist, probably, in the world and, in his eyes, there is no one capable of filling his shoes,” Bianco added. “And it just shows that they’re [the Democrats are] struggling. They don’t have a viable leader. So right now, we still know that I’m going to still be number one, but now, the way it looks, it’s more and more possible that Steve ends up number two, and that would be great for California.”\n\nIn addition to Porter, Swalwell, Villaraigosa, Steyer, and Becerra, the Democratic candidates running for governor include former state assembly Majority Leader Ian Calderon, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, and former State Controller Betty Yee. California Attorney General Rob Bonta and billionaire businessman Rick Caruso are also reportedly considering entering the race as Democrats.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris announced July 30 she would not run for governor.\n\nHilton told the DCNF that, as of the time of the interview, the Democrat he thinks will advance to face him in the general election will be either Porter, Swalwell, Steyer, or Bonta — if he decides to run.\n\nA UC Berkeley Institute of Government Studies (IGS) poll conducted in late October 2025 also showed the two Republican candidates being within striking distance of making the general election — with no Democrat clearly leading the pack. The survey, conducted before Swalwell’s Nov. 20 entry into the race, also found Bianco leading with 13% support. Porter was in second place with 11%, and Becerra and Hilton both tied for third with 8% of support each. Forty-four percent of respondents polled identified as undecided.\n\nA Republican has not won a gubernatorial election in California since former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s landslide reelection in 2006.\n\nHilton also observed California “has gone further and further and further to the far left” in the years since the state switched to the top-two primary.\n\n“We’ve become, in California, the Wuhan lab of far-left extremism where they’ve been experimenting on the state with these ideological schemes that have ended in complete disaster, the worst results of any state in America: 50th out of 50 on affordability, 50th out of 50 on opportunity, highest unemployment rate, highest poverty rate, it is a complete disaster,” he added referencing findings of various studies. (RELATED: California Gov Hopefuls Throw Newsom Under The Bus After He Skips A City Where Kids Were Shot)\n\n“I think that the people who argued for it [the top-two primary] argued that it would promote more moderate policy outcomes as people would be trying to appeal to a broad cross section of the electorate, not to their party base. Well, how has that turned out?” Hilton continued. “So, far from delivering more moderate outcomes, it’s delivered the exact opposite, more extremism of the far-left variety, which is a catastrophe for our state and the country, because what happens in California influences the whole country.”\n\nCalifornia voters approved Proposition 14, the ballot measure which replaced traditional party-based primaries with contests rewarding the top-two candidates in June 2010, 54% to 46%. Schwarzenegger, then the state’s term-limited incumbent governor, prominently supported and raised money for the ballot initiative, viewed as the “brainchild” of his Republican lieutenant governor, Abel Maldonado, ABC News reported at the time.\n\nBoth Bianco and Hilton expressed willingness to reform California’s unconventional primary system.\n\nThe Riverside County Sheriff called the top-two primary “disastrous.”\n\n“That is absolutely disastrous in a true democratic republic, that’s not how government was supposed to be designed. We are supposed to have elections like everybody else has in the country; California has destroyed our election process,” Bianco told the DNCF. “I’ve already been saying that I will eliminate it [the top-two primary] the second I’m governor, and they know it’s going to happen.”\n\n“I strongly disagree with the top-two system, and would do anything in my power and ability to to get rid of it, but we’ve got to be practical and focus on winning within the system that we have,” Hilton told the outlet. “And therefore my entire focus is on making the case for change in California with positive, practical ideas that working class Californians who’ve been hurt the hardest by these 15 years of one party rule can see will deliver them a better life.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Leno-jawed hussy Olivia Nuzzi and Vanity Fair are not parting ways over a breach of journalistic ethics. She’s out for only one reason — the belief that her violation of journalistic ethics helped Donald Trump.\n\nYou gotta see The Matrix.\n\nWhat do you think—that suddenly a leftist outlet like Vanity Fair caught a case of journalistic integrity? This Vanity Fair? This one? THIS one? Please.\n\nHere’s the narrative currently being spun to pretend Vanity Fair is all about the journalisming…\n\nAfter hiring Olivia Nuzzi as its West Coast editor, Vanity Fair editor Mark Guiducci strapped on a shocked face to pretend he was aghast to learn that the hussy might have an ethical problem. You see, after she was hired for that prestigious role, Nuzzi’s former two-time cuck (I’ll explain this below) and fiancée, Ryan Lizza went the full-bitter cuck route and published a series of Substack essays exposing what everyone already knew years before Vanity Fair hired her: that Olivia Nuzzi is a hussy with zero ethics.\n\nTurns out she not only allegedly had an “intense personal relationship” with the left’s most hated apostate, current Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., she also allegedly banged a Republican, former South Carolina Governor Mark “I’ll Be Back In Two Weeks” Sanford.\n\nIn both cases, Cuck Lizza claims the hussy was assigned to cover her alleged bangees. In fact, the elite DC couple had book contracts to cover both alleged bangees.\n\nHilariously, Cuck Lizza stuck with Nuzzi after the Sanford incident, which, once you add in Bobby Jr., makes Lizza a two-time cuck.\n\nHere’s what Vanity Fair already knew about serial sidepiece Nuzzi when it bestowed upon her the title of West Coast Editor: 1) that New York Magazine had fired her over the Kennedy thing, 2) she once broke into Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski’s home, and 3) she’s a dreadful writer.\n\n“The wildfire is over my shoulder now, over the hill. The waxing gibbous moon is over my head. A thought bubble, it shines blankly,” she actually wrote in her just-released memoir American Canto.\n\nCan it get worse than a “gibbous moon?” Yes, yes it can…\n\nPeople ask me now about anger. About my lack of it. How? How could I not be enraged? I think this over. I scan the terrain of my body. My chest, my spine, behind my belly button. I look for pale pulses of idle fury, waiting for the alarm to sound at the trip wire of my veins. There is nothing there. There is nothing there because I loaded a gun. I loaded a gun and set it on my nightstand.\nYou cannot live in America without thinking about guns, without thinking that one day you might not live anymore in America, and the reason will be a gun. 46,728 lives ended in America in 2023 because of a gun. 27,300 suicides. 17,927 homicides. 604 police shootings. 463 accidents. 434 undetermined. On the 405, a billboard announces that gun injuries are the number one cause of death for American children. You think: A gun will protect me from guns. Then you recall the statistic, that a gun in your home doubles your chances of dying by homicide. Still I loaded a gun. I loaded a gun and set it on my nightstand.\n\nBut now, NOW, we’re supposed to believe Vanity Fair has suddenly caught a case of integrity over behavior it was well aware of before making her West Coast Editor?\n\nThe real reason she’s out is her interview with the far-left Bulwark, where she was shamed for not torpedoing Kennedy’s nomination as Health and Human Services Secretary.\n\n“He’s being nominated to HHS Secretary… You had information that you could have shared… and you didn’t share anything about him. Why? Did you still love him?” asked the Bulwark.\n\n“I don’t know how to responsibly handle this on camera,” the hussy responded.\n\n“ You admit in the book that you’d acted to help him over the course of the campaign. And so once you realized that he was screwing you over, you didn’t take any counteraction,” pressed the Bulwark.\n\nThen the hussy began to cry like a little girl.\n\nAs far as the Corporate Media Borg is concerned, she aided and abetted the Trump administration, and that is what cannot be allowed. It’s okay if she breaks into a Republican’s home. It’s okay if she makes everything she writes about her and puts forth prose so purple it would make Prince wince. That’s allowed. What she cannot be forgiven for is her betrayal of the leftist cause, and because her only answer for betraying the leftist cause is crying like a girl, she’s out, she’s gone, banished, 86’d, arrivederci’d, solongimetcha…\n\nAll she had to do to return to the good graces of the legacy media was to answer the Bulwark’s softball question with a brazen lie, something like how the Trump administration had threatened to kill her entire family if she came forward about Kennedy, and all the doors would remain open. But here’s the thing… Like most leftist women, Nuzzi is a dead-souled, narcissistic basket case.\n\nAllow me to put it this way… If you think Nuzzi is gone because the elite media believe in ethics, how many people were fired over this…?\n\nThe Hegseth ‘Kill Everybody’ Hoax\nTrump “Destroying” White House Hoax\nPhoto of Starving Gaza Baby Hoax\nIsraeli Troops Murdered Food-Seeking Palestinians Hoax\nTrump Tariffs Will Explode Prices Hoax\nMaryland Man Hoax\nBlack Newborns Much More Likely to Die If Doc’s White Hoax\nElon Musk Nazi Salute Hoax\nMass Hysterectomies Performed on Immigrants Hoax\nThe All-White Trump Party Hoax\nSpringfield Bomb Threat Hoax\nTrump Called for Liz Cheney to Be Executed Hoax\nViolent Crime Down Under Biden/Harris Hoax\nArlington Cemetery Hoax\nKamala Was Never America’s Border Czar Hoax\nRussia Collusion Hoax\nHands Up, Don’t Shoot Hoax\nJussie Smollett Hoax\nCovington KKKids Hoax\nVery Fine People Hoax\nSeven-Hour Gap Hoax\nRussian Bounties Hoax\nTrump Trashes Troops Hoax\nPolicemen Killed at Mostly Peaceful January 6 Protest Hoax\nRittenhouse Hoax\nEating While Black Hoax\nBorder Agents Whipping Illegals Hoax\nNASCAR Noose Hoax\nGeorgia Jim Crow 2.0 Hoax\nTrump Assaulted Secret Service Agents and Grabbed Steering Wheel of Beast Hoax\nMAGA Assaulted Paul Pelosi Hoax\nCOVID Lab Leak Theory Is Racist Hoax\nHunter Biden’s Laptop Is Russian Disinformation Hoax\nJoe Biden Will Never Ban Gas Stoves Hoax\nCOVID Deaths are Overcounted Is a Conspiracy Theory Hoax\nMass Graves of Native Children in Canada Hoax\nTrump Killed Japanese Koi Fish Hoax\nTrump Told People to Drink Bleach Hoax\nHamas Hospital Hoax\nIf Reelected, Trump Will Execute People Hoax\nThe 900,000 Kids Hospitalized with Coronavirus Hoax\nDozens of Environmental Hoaxes\nThe Alfa Bank Hoax\nLibs of TikTok Murdered Non-Binary Teen Hoax\nAaron Rodgers Sandy Hook-Truther Hoax\n‘Bloodbath’ Hoax\nBiden ‘Sharp-as-a-Tack’ Hoax\nIowa Poll Hoax\n\nAs long as it benefits the fascist, left-wing cause, lying, bias, protecting your own, withholding information, inventing sources, breaking and entering, and being an overall scumbag is not a sin in the corporate media.

The Duke of Sussex joined Colbert in New York City where he mocked Americans over their fascination with royalty and Christmas-themed films.“I genuinely thought this was the audition for the Gingerbread Prince saves Christmas in Nebraska,” Harry, being ginger, joked as he walked onto the stage. Harry said he had considered acting because he knew how “obsessed” Americans were with Christmas movies and royalty. Colbert challenged him, but Harry responded with a reference to Trump without naming him, according to the New York Post.“Really? I heard you elected a king,” Harry said as boos came from the audience. Colbert responded, “That’s a fair point, no, he’s got a point.”He continued the jibes at the US president while imagining how he would land a role in a movie. “I’ll record a self-tape, I’ll fly myself to an audition, settle a baseless lawsuit with the White House. All the things you people on TV do,” he said, referencing CBS’s $16 million settlement with Trump. CBS's settlement with Trump was over his claim that the network and “60 Minutes” deceptively edited an interview with Kamala Harris during the 2024 election campaign.Colbert protested, “Hey, Harry, I didn’t do any of those things.” Harry replied, “Maybe that’s why you’re canceled.” The segment ended with Colbert and Harry in an awkward embrace as fake snow fell on the stage.The royal has been at odds with Trump over the past year. Earlier, Trump considered deporting Harry over immigration issues and later made jabs at him during a speech at Windsor Castle. Despite the tensions, Trump decided against taking action, saying, “I don’t want to do that. I’ll leave him alone. He’s got enough problems with his wife.

According to The Examination, the chemicals used in lithium-ion batteries that power EVs \"pose tricky environmental problems.\" Some of the companies behind those chemicals \"stand accused of misleading regulators, hiding information and contaminating communities while making similar, related products.\"\n\nThere's also the environmental damage done by mining the minerals needed for the batteries, as well as the child labor and abhorrent working conditions of some of those mining operations. I suppose the environmentalist Left has no qualms about cracking some eggs to make that green omelette.\n\nResearch also shows that 56 percent of EVs still lose money over the long run, and that EVs cause more pollution than their gas-powered counterparts. Proponents argue driving an EV will save you money in the long run, but research also shows the cost of operating an EV translates into gas prices of roughly $17.33 a gallon. That doesn't even take into account the cost of retrofitting a house to manage the electricity demands, and what about people who live in apartments? I live in a manufactured home, sans garage, and I am prohibited from putting an EV charger on the lot I rent.\n\nAs I write this, it's a balmy 16 degrees here in Wisconsin. Cold weather significantly reduces the battery life of an EV and limits driving range. When the battery dies, you have no way to heat your vehicle if you're, say, stuck in traffic in a blizzard. Of course, the lithium-ion battery could catch fire, and that would keep you warm for days, because they burn long and hot (and sometimes fire departments don't know how to manage them).\n\nWhat's the carbon footprint of a burning Tesla again?\n\nCNN also chimed in, claiming \"the rest of the world\" is moving towards EVs and \"efficient machines.\" \n\nCNN says Trump's fuel economy based on fossil fuel will set back Americans.\"You know humanity has always moved toward the most efficient machine available at the time.

Places like India and China — the world's biggest polluters — are doing no such thing. Europe is small enough that trains and short-hop flights make travel easy, and public transportation infrastructure is more practical. Not so in America, where the state of Texas is roughly the same size as the entire country of France.\n\nThe Biden administration used the full weight of the government to try to force people into costly, less reliable vehicles that they didn't want. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the transition to EVs was happening whether we wanted it or not (sure, Skippy). Kamala Harris envisioned a world where gas-powered cars were illegal and wanted a mandate that automakers only manufacture electric or hydrogen-powered cars by 2035. At the same time, despite spending billions, the Biden administration failed to install a single electric vehicle charger anywhere in the country.\n\nIt's almost like they don't want us to drive, well, anywhere. But I digress.\n\nPeople move towards the machines that work, that get them from Point A to Point B safely and affordably. If it happens to be the most efficient, that's great. But it has to work, first and foremost. Even the state of Maryland, hardly MAGA country, quietly pulled the plug on its EV mandate earlier this year, admitting it's unsustainable and unrealistic. Auto worker unions also opposed EVs, citing job losses and other economic concerns.\n\nI notice the NYT and CNN didn't whine about that.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/amy-curtis/2025/12/06/nyt-auto-regs-sat-n2667373","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2022/103/0d3f6153-44b6-4ba7-88dd-d8d60a4f3a75.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 14:00:00","author":"Amy Curtis","authors":["Amy Curtis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.301},{"id":385629434,"title":"BROADCAST BIAS: Networks blast Trump ‘tirade’ but not $1B Somali scam rocking Minnesota","text":"Many local stories that could be harmful to Democrat politicians don’t become national TV stories for an obvious reason. In the case of the massive welfare fraud committed by Somalis in Minnesota under Democrat Gov. Tim Walz, former Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2024 running mate, that is doubly obvious. The focus launched with conservatives on Nov. 19 with a City Journal article by Christopher Rufo and Ryan Thorpe with a rather unforgettable sentence: \"The largest funder of [al Qaeda-linked] al-Shabaab is the Minnesota taxpayer.\" Fraudulent social-service payments were sent to Somalia, and ended up in a dangerous place. The New York Times arrived late to the story on Nov. 30. The online headline was \"How Fraud Swamped Minnesota’s Social Services System on Tim Walz’s Watch.\" The front page in the paper was notably softer: \"The Social Services Corruption That Preyed on Minnesota Nice.\" A better term would have been \"preyed on Minnesota Woke.\" On \"Meet the Press,\" host Kristen Welker began with the obvious method of broadcast-network introduction of a story — taking exception to something President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social. He tagged Walz with the R-word, or as Welker put it, \"a slur widely regarded as derogatory towards people with intellectual disabilities.\" Walz then unloaded two minutes of denouncing Trump for \"meanness.\" WALZ 'HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTE FAILURE' IN COMBATING FRAUD, SAYS GOP GUBERNATORIAL CHALLENGER ROBBINS For her second question, Welker arrived at the billion dollars of fraud, and, showing she’d read the New York Times, cited that amount is \"more than Minnesota spends each year to run its Department of Corrections, so I want to give you a chance to respond to this. Do you take responsibility for failing to stop this fraud in your state?\" Walz dodged: \"Well, certainly, I take responsibility for putting people in jail.\" That’s fake news. Walz has put no one in jail. Federal agents and the United States attorney for the District of Minnesota investigated, exposed and prosecuted the fraudsters. Then her questions worsened again, as Welker asked Walz to explain how Trump’s suffering a major cognitive decline. On Dec. 1, the New York Post reported that almost 500 state employees tweeted, \"Tim Walz is 100% responsible for massive fraud in Minnesota. We let Tim Walz know of fraud early on, hoping for a partnership in stopping fraud but no, we got the opposite response.\" The broadcast networks passed on it. ICE OPERATION IN MINNEAPOLIS NABS A DOZEN 'WORST OF THE WORST' CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS, INCLUDING SOMALIS On Dec. 2, \"NBC Nightly News\" broke the silence in one sentence of a White House roundup by reporter Gabe Gutierrez: \"Federal prosecutors have charged dozens of people in Minnesota's Somali community for allegedly stealing hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money meant for social service programs.\" ABC, CBS and PBS just shamelessly ran Trump’s angry response that night without any context of massive fraud: \"We're going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country. Ilhan Omar is garbage. She's garbage. Her friends are garbage. These aren't people that work…. They complain and do nothing but bitch.\" The same context-free pattern on Trump’s \"presidential tirade\" continued on Wednesday morning shows on ABC and NBC, while \"CBS Mornings\" included a small mention by reporter Nancy Cordes, that Trump’s \"been talking about Somalis ever since the story broke last week about a fraud ring in Minnesota, which has the nation’s highest concentration of Somali Americans.\" EMMER SLAMS WALZ, DEMANDS ACCOUNTABILITY OVER ALLEGED RETALIATION TIED TO MINNESOTA FRAUD On Wednesday night, White House reporter Mary Bruce finally produced a snippet of context: \"The New York Times reports 59 people have been convicted in schemes involving more than $1 billion in stolen taxpayer money that was supposed to go to children and other social services. President Trump seizing on this story as he widens his immigration crackdown.\" Trump \"seized\" on the scandal, while ABC whiffed. Bruce then let the Democrats respond. \"But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey defending the Somali community.\" Frey said \"He’s wrong and we want them here.\" Wait. He’s wrong about the billion dollars in fraud? CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION On \"Meet the Press,\" host Kristen Welker began with the obvious method of broadcast-network introduction of a story — taking exception to something President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social. One reason Trump might have been called Minnesota Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar \"garbage\" is her connections to the fraudsters in the Somali community. The New York Post reported on Thursday that Omar and her staffers defended the fraudulent charity called \"Feeding Our Future.\" Guhaad Hashi Said, who worked on Omar’s 2018 and 2020 campaign as an \"enforcer\" who oversaw Somali voter mobilization, pleaded guilty in August to running a fake food site called Advance Youth Athletic Development, where he falsely claimed to serve 5,000 meals a day and pocketed $3.2 million out of the food program. The worst broadcast interview on the topic this week happened with Omar on National Public Radio’s \"Morning Edition.\" Co-host Michel Martin did the spoon-feeding of Omar: \"I just wondered what went through your mind when he said things like they contribute nothing and should go back to where they came from and so on.\" Omar replied: \"His vile rant really wasn't a surprise to me. He has trafficked in racism, in xenophobia, in bigotry and Islamophobia for as long as he has held office.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP On the fourth question, Martin finally laid out that fraud occurred, and then just asked \"do you have any reaction to that information?\" Omar said she was happy there was accountability. Martin followed up with another puffball: \"Are you concerned that an entire community is being scapegoated because of the actions of this group of people?\" Never allow leftist broadcast media operatives to step onto a soap box and say they’re all about \"holding government accountable.\" Scandals like this underline that every scandal somehow ends up as a Trump scandal. He said something uncouth about a Somali-organized fraud. Omar isn’t described as unleashing a \"tirade\" when she calls Trump a racist bigot and an Islamophobe. They agree with it, so it’s just righteous speech. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TIM GRAHAM","summary":"Gov.

It sat there for four years, collecting dust. No one did anything to solve this,” declared Attorney General Pam Bondi on “Fox and Friends” Friday morning. “Old evidence, new people, great police work, that’s all it is. Good old-fashioned police work.”\n\n“All we can go off at this point is what the FBI has said and that is they put a fresh set of eyes on evidence the FBI has had for almost five years,” added a House Republican aide involved in an investigation into the pipe bomb. “It’s either incompetence or gross negligence.”\n\nRelatives, neighbors and sources familiar with the investigation into Brian Cole Jr. who spoke with The Post have also painted a picture of a “naïve” young man — likely on the autism spectrum — who wouldn’t have thrown up red flags while trotting out a pet chihuahua for walks near his family’s home in Woodbridge, Va.\n\n“He’s almost autistic-like because he doesn’t understand a lot of stuff,” Cole’s grandmother Loretta said when reached by phone Wednesday for comment. “He’s not a terrorist. … He’s very naïve. He would not hurt a fly. He’s just not that kind of person.”\n\nThe affidavit filed Thursday highlighted how video surveillance cameras of the suspect, cell phone data and a purchasing history that matched the component materials for the bomb are the only publicly available evidence tying Cole to the act of potential political violence.\n\nFederal campaign finance records and voter data hasn’t pointed to Cole having strong political views either, with some sources indicating he believed that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump — but he also made conflicting statements during a four-hour interview with investigators Thursday when he copped to the crime.\n\nA national Republican operative also insisted to The Post on Friday there was “zero indication” that Cole was a Trump voter.\n\nCole did not appear to have registered with either party in Virginia and did not vote in primary races — but did cast ballots in general elections in 2016, 2017, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2024. His father’s party identity is unknown but he was once defended by high-profile civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who repped George Floyd’s family.\n\nA “Brian Cole” of Lorton, Va., which sits next to Woodbridge, donated a total $50 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2018. The same individual, who lists themself as “not employed,” donated another $50 on the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue in December 2024, per FEC filings.\n\nAnother “Brian Cole,” of Fairfax, Va., who listed his employment as “bail bondsman” for “Mr Bail Inc.,” which doesn’t match the name of the accused bomber’s father’s business, contributed $104.10 on the Republican fundraising platform WinRed in March 2024, other FEC filings show.\n\nBut the accused bomber evaded being collared by the authorities for nearly five years while living with his parents and siblings just 30 miles southwest of the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee HQs that he later targeted.\n\nAs of July 2023, then-FBI Director Christopher Wray, who served under both Trump and Biden, testified to Congress that the bureau had seemingly exhausted its leads for the case, even as the attack potentially threatened Vice President Kamala Harris, who was at the Democratic National Committee when the explosives were found.\n\n“We have done thousands of interviews, reviewed something like 40,000 video files … 500 something tips,” Wray told Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) in a House Judiciary Committee hearing that same month.\n\n“We have conducted all logical investigative steps and interviewed all logical individuals at this point,” the FBI boss added in the July 12, 2023, public hearing.\n\nA senior FBI special agent informed the Judiciary panel the year before that the suspect’s “motive and ideology remain unknown” and urged other agents at the Washington Field Office to “include sources reporting on all [types of] threats,” which Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) wrote “raises questions about the progress and extent of the FBI’s investigation given its tardiness.\n\nFormer FBI Washington Field Office Assistant Director in Charge Steven D’Antuono, who ran the investigation for its first two years, maintained in an interview with ABC News in July 2023 that the probe was “still a priority for us” even after so many cold leads.\n\nThe month before, D’Antuono had revealed in a congressional interview that the bureau still knew nearly nothing about the pipe bomb suspect other than a physical appearance captured on video surveillance cameras.\n\n“We don’t know. We don’t even know the gender at this point,” he said in a separate exchange with Massie about how the explosives were supposed to detonate.\n\n“Do you think it was technically possible for a kitchen timer,” Massie began in the June 7, 2023, transcribed in the June 7, 2023, interview before the House Judiciary Committee, that has one-hour duration to detonate a bomb 17 hours later?”\n\n“No, I don’t. And I saw the same kitchen timer as you. I agree. I don’t know when they were supposed to go off,” D’Antuono responded, emphasizing the FBI’s forensics lab in Quantico, Va., found the explosives were “viable.”\n\nMassie has since expressed doubt that Cole is even the bomber, joining other people who have leveled alternative explanations as well as conspiracy theories about the suspect’s motivations.\n\nA separate inquiry by the House’s Select Subcommittee on January 6 put out a report in January 2025 showing why so many of those leads — when compared with a federal affidavit identifying Cole that was filed in DC federal court — didn’t identify him as the suspect.\n\nAt least seven people purchased the same kitchen timer found on the pipe bomb between Dec. 1, 2020 and Jan. 5, 2021, but the affidavit on Cole reveals he bought his timer on June 3, 2020.\n\nAt least 186 “phone numbers of interest” were flagged based on cell phone tower connections in the vicinity of Capitol Hill and the FBI claimed at some points that the data had been “corrupted,” but Cole’s affidavit made no mention of that latter fact.\n\nIn fact, few leads the FBI told the House select subcommittee about would have included Cole as a “person of interest” when compared with the affidavit, except one “who owned a pair of Nike Air Max Speed Turf sneakers and who worked ‘in the area of the crime.’”\n\nBrian Cole Sr. owns and runs the company Brian Cole Bail Bonds, which was raided by the FBI this week amid his son’s arrest. Cole Jr. works at his father’s bail bonds business.\n\nOne of those other persons searched for “pipe bomb DC” online before the explosives were placed; another took photos of the RNC on the morning of Jan. 5, 2021; another drove a car by the RNC after the bombs were placed with a passenger matching the suspect’s description and five more had similar cell tower data.\n\nThe subcommittee’s Jan. 2, 2025, report faulted law enforcement for associated “security failures” with responding to the pipe bombs discovery on the afternoon of the Capitol riot and suggested that the DOJ and FBI under Biden appeared to prioritize Jan. 6 riot cases over the pipe bomb investigation.\n\nChairman Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) said in a statement after Cole’s arrest that his investigation was “ongoing” but thanked the FBI “for their diligence and continued partnership” with his select subcommittee.\n\n“The FBI’s arrest of the alleged January 6 pipe bomber is a tremendous breakthrough in a mystery that has haunted the country for nearly five years,” Loudermilk added.\n\nPatel claimed at a Thursday press conference that Biden’s FBI “sat on the evidence for four years. There wasn’t any production of new evidence from five years ago.”\n\n“We looked at three million lines of evidence,” he went on. “We went back and looked at the cell phone tower data dumps. We went back and looked at the providers and what information they provided pursuant to search warrants at the time and asked questions, such as ‘Why weren’t all the phone numbers scrubbed?’ and ‘Why weren’t they connected?’ and ‘Why wasn’t there any geolocational data done?’\n\n“Now that is either sheer incompetence or complete intentional negligence, neither of which is acceptable for this FBI. So, we changed that in the prior eight months, not on just this case, but everyone. And what that did was allow us to narrow the search down,” he explained.\n\nDC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro added that Cole from all external signs was also “quiet individual that you would never imagine could put a pipe bomb [and] put it together.”\n\nCole faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted for transporting an explosive device across state lines with the intent to kill, injure and damage property to attempted malicious destruction by means of explosive materials.\n\nThe FBI, DOJ, RNC and DNC did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Post reached out to D’Antuono for comment Friday. Wray could not be reached for comment.","summary":"\"It’s either incompetence or gross negligence,\" one House Republican aide quipped of the probe stalled for nearly five years.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/06/us-news/how-30-year-old-chihuahua-walking-autistic-like-pipe-bomb-suspect-brian-cole-jr-stumped-bidens-fbi-for-years/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/116815704.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wx0dAH7j-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-06 11:01:21","author":"Josh Christenson","authors":["Josh Christenson"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.247}]}
