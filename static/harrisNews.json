(He’s now running for Nancy Pelosi’s seat in Congress.)\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom signed the law last September, though he had to know it was unconstitutional. The Supremacy Clause makes clear that states have no power to regulate federal law enforcement.\n\nChief McDonnell gave an even better reason for not enforcing it: having one armed police force confront another armed police force was an incredibly stupid idea.\n\n“The reality of one armed agency approaching another armed agency to create conflict over something that would be a misdemeanor at best or an infraction, it doesn’t make any sense. It’s not a good public policy decision and it wasn’t well thought out in my opinion,” he said.\n\nPut bluntly: the LAPD isn’t about to start a civil war. \n\nMcDonnell made clear that his department does not support ICE operations. But he isn’t interested in a law that would require him to trigger a violent clash with federal officers.\n\nDemocrats called SB 627 the “No Secret Police Act.” But there is good reason to protect the identities of ICE agents.\n\nRadical activists have been stalking and targeting ICE agents — and people they wrongly believe to be ICE agents, like the air marshals that a mob trapped in a restaurant in Lynwood this week. \n\nAnd the bad behavior isn’t confined to the fringes of politics.\n\nPhiladelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner vowed this week to “hunt” ICE agents down, calling them “wannabe Nazis.”\n\nEffectively, he put a target on their backs — and not just for prosecution, but for vigilantism.\n\nGovernor Newsom has done the same. He admitted, in a podcast with conservative Ben Shapiro, that it was wrong to call ICE agents “terrorists,” as his own press office had done.\n\nThe very next day, he claimed that ICE was “terrorizing our communities.”\n\nClearly, ICE agents would be in danger if they were forced to reveal their identities.\n\nAnd local police would be forced to defend them.\n\nWiener’s legislation was always terrible policy, and put law enforcement officers — local and federal — in danger. It is just the latest example of bad law, passed for symbolic or ideological reasons, or for short-term political expediency.\n\nIn 2024, Newsom boasted that he had signed a law banning so-called “deep fake” parodies of politicians on social media.\n\nThe following year, a federal judge threw out the law as a violation of the First Amendment. \n\nNewsom must have known that would happen — but he signed the law anyway, because he wanted to be seen defending then-Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris from mockery by billionaire Trump supporter Elon Musk.\n\nCalifornia has enough real problems for legislators to deal with, rather than passing pointless and even dangerous laws.","summary":"LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell said this week that he had no intention of enforcing a new law that bans ICE agents from wearing masks in the state.","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/02/01/opinion/mask-comes-off-useless-anti-ice-law/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/gregory-bovino-chief-patrol-agent-115418281.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/hktEQQcb-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2026-02-02 00:59:47","author":"Ca Post Editorial Board","authors":["Ca Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.478},{"id":398418828,"title":"Kanye West's message to Bianca Censori exposed by lip reader at Grammy Awards","text":"Kanye West and his wife, Bianca Censori , made a striking entrance at the Grammy Awards on Sunday evening, instantly capturing attention as Censori stepped out in a jaw-dropping ensemble.

Red carpet photographs revealed that the garment offered minimal coverage whatsoever. Snuggling up to her husband Kanye as they struck poses for the cameras , the rapper, clad entirely in black, seemed to murmur something into her ear. According to lip-reading expert Nicola Hickling, Kanye whispered to Censori: \"I'll tell 'em you're on fire tonight, babe.\" The remark proved apt, given that all attention was focused on Censori due to her daring sartorial selection. The duo made their entrance in matching $450,000 chrome-finished Mercedes-Maybachs at the distinguished musical ceremony.

Ostensibly, those agents were there to carry out deportations, a centerpiece of President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign. After all, 72% of voters said immigration played a big role in casting their ballot that year. \n\nBut all of this—those votes and those bullets—is based on the fake problem of immigration.\n\nNineteen percent of Americans say immigration is the “most important problem” in the U.S., according to Gallup. That puts it ahead of inflation (11%) and “the economy in general” (17%). Even if you combine all economy-related items, immigration is seen as the nation’s third-most pressing issue, behind only that motley of economic concerns (35%) and “the government/poor leadership” (26%). This is a common result across public polling.\n\nPerhaps for some of these Americans, the trouble with immigration in the U.S. is the country’s onerous path to citizenship or Trump’s brutal deportation actions. They wouldn’t be wrong. But that’s not what most of these people are thinking of. Most see immigration itself as the problem. In 2024, Trump won 89% of voters who ranked immigration as their top issue, according to exit polls.\n\nThe thing is, immigration has no downsides that aren’t dramatically outweighed by its benefits. And the core concerns around immigration are typically based on egregious lies.\n\nObjections to immigration tend to rely on the false notion that immigrants are more prone to crime. Throughout the 2024 campaign, Trump held rallies featuring headshots of immigrants who had allegedly committed crimes. At a rally in Colorado, he said his Democratic opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, “has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the third world. And she has had them resettled, beautifully, into your community to prey upon innocent American citizens.”\n\nAfter he won that year’s election, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security tried to tie falling crime rates—part of a yearslong trend—to his deportation agenda. \n\n“These arrests and deportations of criminal illegal aliens are having real impact on public safety,” DHS claimed in a statement.\n\nTrump alone has hit on the idea of a crime wave among immigrants more than 575 times recently, according to the Marshall Project.\n\nBut this narrative is false. In fact, the data is so overwhelming that it’s hard to know where to begin.\n\nHow about incarceration rates? A 2025 study by the libertarian Cato Institute found that immigrants, both legal and undocumented, are far less likely than native-born Americans to wind up behind bars. In every year of their data, which spanned 2010 through 2023, the incarceration rate for undocumented immigrants was between 31% and 56% below that for native-born Americans. Among legal immigrants, it was even lower: between 65% and 75% under the rate for native-born Americans.\n\nAs it turns out, this disparity in incarceration rates has been true for the past 150 years of American history, according to a recent study by the nonpartisan National Bureau of Economic Research. And it’s remained true even as the nation’s undocumented population has ballooned, hitting an estimated 14 million in 2023. \n\nAs the Cato study’s authors put it, “[A] general mass deportation policy indiscriminately targeted at all illegal immigrants will not reduce crime rates, nor will reductions in legal immigration.”\n\nIn fact, it may do the opposite. A higher share of immigrants in a population has either no effect on rates of lethal violence or is associated with lower crime rates overall, according to a literature review included in a fresh study in the Journal of Criminal Justice. The reason for this is that new immigrants often settle in disadvantaged communities, supplying those areas with new economic activity and other types of social stability, like solid family structures and good work ethics.\n\nAnd despite Trump’s hysteria about foreign drug traffickers, research shows that larger immigrant populations may actually decrease local overdose deaths. One study from 2022—aptly titled “More immigrants, less death”—found that “immigration is not associated with higher levels of overdose or homicide deaths, and when effects are significant, immigration is linked to lower levels of overdose mortality across multiple substances and destination types.”\n\nIn social science, this research is part of what’s known as the immigrant revitalization thesis. \n\nBut Republicans, unaware of or undeterred by the evidence, are skilled at manufacturing a crisis where one doesn’t exist. A few months ahead of the 2024 election, 48% of Americans said they personally worry about illegal immigration “a great deal,” per Gallup.\n\nAnd yet, as Trump acts on his big anti-immigration agenda, it has been a bust. On Jan. 18, the administration tried to claim that 70% of the immigrants it had detained were violent criminals, which is nowhere close to the truth.\n\nBetween Jan. 20 and Oct. 15 last year, just 7% of immigrants arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement had a violent conviction, according to a New York Times analysis. Several thousand others face charges as minor as a traffic violation. And one-third of those arrested had no criminal record whatsoever.\n\nIf immigrants make communities safer overall, as the evidence suggests, you have to wonder what will happen to those communities after the immigrants have been disappeared.\n\nAny updates?\n\n Two new polls have Democrats at high risk of locking themselves out of the governor’s mansion in California. The state has a jungle primary, meaning all candidates, regardless of party, run in one primary, and the top two vote-getters in that primary advance to the general election. As I wrote in December, the sheer size of the Democratic field has split the vote too much, with polls showing the race’s two Republicans leading. And now a pair of new polls, one for the left-leaning group California Environmental Voters and the other for Democratic candidate Katie Porter, show that very same thing—but with slightly larger leads for the Republicans.\n\n ICE is expected to provide security at this year’s Winter Olympics … in Italy. If that sounds bizarre and unnecessary to you, you’re not alone. A majority of Americans (51%) oppose the idea, with just 33% supporting it, per YouGov.\n\nThis feels like a turning point, doesn’t it?\n\nThis past Tuesday, just a few days after federal immigration agents executed intensive-care nurse Alex Pretti, YouGov asked Americans the following question: “At various times, there have been turning points in American politics, where things could have gone in a very different direction. At other times, things that seemed important turned out not to be significant. What does this moment feel more like to you?”\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans say we’re at “a significant turning point” in American politics. Just 13% say it’s “not too significant,” while the remaining 22% are unsure.\n\nThat feels dramatic. That feels big. But the unfortunate truth is that those figures are basically no different from any other time YouGov has asked the question in the past year and a half.\n\nSixty-five percent said the nation was at a turning point the day after a gunman nearly assassinated Trump in July 2024. But was that moment really a turning point? Trump was already leading then-President Joe Biden in polling for that year’s election, with the Biden campaign’s own data showing Trump on track to pick up 400 electoral votes. Even after then-Vice President Kamala Harris replaced Biden on the Democratic ticket, her loss was foretold by the fact that the vast majority of incumbent parties in democracies lost elections that year.\n\nOf course, turning-point moments do happen: World War II, Watergate, 9/11, so on. And people responding to these polls could read “this moment” as a broader span of time, perhaps one encompassing the entire Trump era. Still, a lot of political moments that feel like a sea change come up short. \n\nAnd yet this data may also tell us more about what people want a political moment to represent and less about what they actually believe it does. \n\nWhich brings us back to Minnesota. Federal immigration agents, high on a cocktail of power, cruelty, and disregard for human life, unjustifiably killed a mother of three and a nurse who treated injured veterans. Confronted by such tragedies, we want the magnitude of their horror to be matched or even outweighed by the change they inspire, the good they bring. We want all this suffering to mean something.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics or culture.\n\n\n\n\nFederal immigration agents gunned down two Americans in Minneapolis in January.

This should be a no-brainer.“ Newsweek reached out to the White House and Office of Personnel Management (OPM) by email outside of normal business hours on Sunday for comment. Why It Matters During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump addressed a range of issues and pledged to tackle everything from economic hardship to healthcare concerns, including his famous “no tax on tips“ pledge and his pledge to make IVF accessible for all Americans. “I have been a leader on IVF, which is fertilization,“ Trump said during a debate against Vice President Kamala Harris. “I've been a leader on it. They know that and everybody else knows it.“ To that end, he signed an executive order last February that aimed at expanding access to IVF and reducing its costs, but that order directed federal agencies to develop polices to reduce costs, examine possible ways to expand access, and to protect access to IVF. However, by August 2025, it appeared that the president had walked back his broader plan, with The Washington Post reporting the administration had moved away from plans to improve access due to legal constraints, since it may require congressional approval and put the president at odds with other conservatives. The administration made another update in October 2025, announcing that employers could voluntarily offer standalone IVF coverage alongside negotiated discounts on certain IVF drugs, rather than pursue a general government mandate. Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, speaks during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol Building on January 6 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) What To Know In a letter to Scott Kupor, the director of OPM, Duckworth and Walkinshaw reminded him of Trump's campaign pledge, quoting him in two instances, in which he said: “Under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for [IVF] that treatment, or we're going to be mandating that the insurance company pay,“ as well as, “Your government will pay for, or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for, all costs associated with IVF treatment.“ Specifically, however, the lawmakers focused their request on Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB), asking that OPM cover IVF for federal workers and “providing access to the same coverage for civil servants that Members of Congress, congressional staff, and private-sector employees already have.“ “Many everyday Americans struggling with the painful challenge of infertility and unable to afford IVF believed Donald Trump,“ the letter stated. “They cast their ballots to return him to office with the explicit expectation that, during his second term, president Trump would make the federal government or private insurance companies pay for 'all costs associated with IVF treatment.'“ “One year into the second term of the Trump administration, President Trump has folded in the face of those opposed to IVF, fulfilling their prediction that President Trump's campaign promise to make IVF free for every American was nothing more than a cynical, deceptive lie,“ they continued. The lawmakers go on to anecdotes of federal employees who struggle to start families since IVF is their only option, but it is not something covered by their health plans currently. This is compounded by the threat of downsizing of the federal government, which would reduce their accessibility even further. The letter also points to OPM's previous role in helping “secure baseline fertility protections across the program and spurred expanded IVF options, including requirements for coverage of artificial insemination and associated drugs and a requirement that all FEHB carriers cover IVF related drugs for 3 cycles annually.“ They urge OPM to act on the opportunity to “aggressively expand IVF coverage mandates across FEHB,“ stressing that “the bottom line is that OPM setting FEHB's required IVF benefit at an identical or equivalent level to the DC Health Link IVF benefit requirements would bring fairness to the federal workforce.“ What People Are Saying President Donald Trump in February 2025 on Truth Social: “Under my leadership, the Republican Party will always support the creation of strong, thriving, healthy American families. We want to make it easier for mothers and fathers to have babies, not harder! That includes supporting the availability of fertility treatments like IVF in every State in America. Like the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of Americans, including the VAST MAJORITY of Republicans, Conservatives, Christians, and Pro-Life Americans, I strongly support the availability of IVF for couples who are trying to have a precious baby. Today, I am calling on the Alabama Legislature to act quickly to find an immediate solution to preserve the availability of IVF in Alabama. The Republican Party should always be on the side of the Miracle of Life - and the side of Mothers, Fathers, and their Beautiful Babies. IVF is an important part of that, and our Great Republican Party will always be with you, in your quest, for the ULTIMATE JOY IN LIFE!“","summary":"President Donald Trump during the 2024 campaign pledged to make IVF affordable and accessible to all Americans.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/duckworth-trump-fulfill-ivf-promises-11450457","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2254968985.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 22:34:06","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.418},{"id":398404046,"title":"Longtime community activist Ismael Ahmed dies at 78","text":"Ismael Ahmed, a beloved figure and longtime community activist in metro Detroit who served in state government and founded Detroit's Concert of Colors among other achievements, has died.\n\nAhmed, often known as \"Ish,\" died Saturday, Jan. 31, at age 78. He had been in hospice at his home in Farmington after being diagnosed with cancer in the last couple of months, his oldest son, Saladin Ahmed, told the Free Press on Sunday, Feb. 1.\n\n\"He was important to his family, and his family was important to him,\" Saladin Ahmed, 50, of Oak Park, said of his father, adding: \"He showed me the world was bigger than the world we grew up ... Made me appreciate the world we grew up in, too.\"\n\nAmong Ismael Ahmed's lasting legacy was his role in building the Dearborn-based nonprofit Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services (ACCESS), where he was executive director for about 25 years. It started as a small storefront operation staffed by volunteers. As of 2024, it had an annual revenue of nearly $50 million and assets of $100 million, according to tax records.\n\nAhmed also helped guide the group during the tense climate facing Arab Americans after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He also helped co-launch the Arab American National Museum and served on its advisory board for many years, ACCESS said in a Jan. 31 Facebook post, signed by its president and CEO, Maha Freij.\n\n\"Ismael was a dear friend to so many, with a long and distinguished career dedicated to public service and community,\" Freij said in the post, adding: \"The impact of his contributions to ACCESS, our community, and the State of Michigan cannot be overstated.\"\n\nFreij noted in the post that Ahmed led the Michigan Department of Human Services under former Gov. Jennifer Granholm, becoming the first and only Arab American to hold one of the state's most significant cabinet roles. He oversaw a $7 billion budget and almost 11,000 employees. Given the economic distress that Michigan faced at the time, it was a challenging time, but Ahmed led with several reforms that improved access for low-income residents.\n\n\"Inside state government, he was a fighter for those who had no megaphone and no lobbyists,\" former Gov. Jennifer Granholm told the Free Press in 2013. \"In addition to making sure that vulnerable children were safe, Ish (he) insisted that we focus on the people who were unseen — the poor, the homeless, the chronically unemployed. He has a heart as big as a barn and a passion for people as vast as the sky.\"\n\nAhmed also served as associate provost for metropolitan impact at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, his alma mater. He worked on a program for thousands of students to volunteer and conduct research across metro Detroit, helping communities.\n\nAhmed was known for his genial nature and warm manners, engaging with people of diverse cultures. He hosted a radio show on WDET (101.9 FM), the eclectic music show called \"This Island Earth\" that reflected his global outlook and love of music of diverse cultures.\n\nAhmed also was a force in metro Detroit's cultural scene, including founding the inaugural Concert of Colors in 1994 when he executive director of ACCESS. The original edition was staged at Chene Park, now called the Aretha Franklin Amphitheatre.\n\nOriginally designed as a standalone concert celebrating world music and Detroit's cultural tapestry, Concert of Colors eventually grew into a free, multiday festival held at venues across Midtown every July. At 32 years, it's one of the longest-running annual music events in the city, presenting local musicians and artists from across the globe.\n\n\"The best way to bring people together is to bring the best of themselves together, and that means culture,\" Ahmed told the Free Press in 1999. \"That's what this festival is about.\"\n\nAhmed also was appointed to the National Council on the Arts by former President Joe Biden, according to the ACCESS Facebook post. In 2013, he won the Neal Shine Award for Exemplary Regional Leadership, sponsored by the Free Press and Metropolitan Affairs Coalition.\n\nIsmael Ahmed was born in Brooklyn, New York City, to an immigrant father from Egypt and a Lebanese-American mother. He was a grandson of Aliya Hassan, an Arab-American and feminist activist who worked with Malcolm X.\n\nAhmed is considered to be a pioneering leader in the Arab American community. After his death, Arab Americans in Michigan poured out tributes to him on social media sites.\n\nMore: Richard Whitmer, father of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, dies at 85\n\nLiving in diverse neighborhoods throughout his life helped inspire his work. Ahmed spoke with a Free Press reporter in 2013 about his life and career.\n\nHe moved from New York City to Dearborn with his family when he was age 6, living close to the historic Ford Rouge plant, he told the Free Press in an interview. His stepfather, of Yemeni descent, worked at the sprawling plant, one of a growing number of Arab American factory workers who flocked to Dearborn for solid paying jobs.\n\nAfter Ahmed graduated from Fordson High School, he went to Henry Ford Community College and then did a stint in the Army during the Vietnam War. He later would become an anti-war activist based on his experiences, telling the ACLU in 2022 that a brother of his who served in the military during the Vietnam War suffered illness from Agent Orange and later died.\n\nAhmed became involved in leftwing and Marxist movements in metro Detroit, speaking out against the Vietnam War and class inequality. He saw the world while working as a deck hand on freighters that sailed around the world. He witnessed firsthand global poverty that he said was caused by corporations. In Dearborn, Arab Americans were fighting attempts by companies and the city to demolish their neighborhoods and marginalize them in the auto plants.\n\n\"I realized there is a system of oppression in this world,\" Ahmed previously told the Free Press. \"I wanted to be part of the solution.\"\n\nIn the 1970s, Ahmed worked on the line at the Ford Rouge plant in Dearborn, where his stepfather had worked, and also in a Ford assembly and engine plant. He helped found ACCESS in 1971 along with other Arab American activists trying to help the growing community.\n\nAhmed also helped form the Arab Workers Caucus, which fought against discrimination in auto plants targeting Arab American workers and called for the UAW to divest from Israel. He was supportive of the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement, a group of Black workers organized in the late 1960s.\n\n\"Arab workers suffer the same class exploitation as the rest of the U.S. proletariat,\" Ahmed wrote in a 1975 essay about the Arab Workers Caucus published in a newsletter.\n\nAhmed said in 2013 that he was still rooted in the ideas that shaped his early years. He believed that history is made by the masses, not by elite leaders, reluctant to take credit for his own leadership.\n\nMore: Remembering Rick Ratliff, a witty journalist with boundless curiosity\n\n\"If I was to be called anything, it would be a community organizer, sometimes a troublemaker,\" Ahmed said. \"A lot of the left ideas, I still maintain them ... I still believe that everything is about regular, everyday people. I believe that while there are some heroes, the real heroes are people who work every day.\"\n\nAs many Arab Americans became Republicans, Ahmed maintained his liberal views, urging the community to vote for Kamala Harris in an op-ed published in the Free Press in 2024. Trump would win Dearborn, with Arab Americans upset over the Gaza war and social issues.\n\n\"I believe we have a responsibility to each other,\" Ahmed told the Free Press. \"We are all brothers and sisters.

And his father was a family man, saying he was \"a very tender and loving father\" who also encouraged his son to figure things out on his own.\n\n\"What he taught me?

Decades later, Saladin Ahmed, a comic book writer, is making a living out of that type of work and said he feels lucky to have had his father to encourage that creativity.\n\n\"I'm just thankful for the big empathic world he raised me in,\" Saladin Ahmed said, adding that his father wanted people to take care of each other. \"If his passing teaches anything to people, I hope that's what it is.\"\n\nIsmael Ahmed was married to his wife, Margaret, for nearly 40 years and had five children and nine grandchildren, Saladin Ahmed said.\n\nHe said there will be no formal funeral, but his father's life will be celebrated at the Concert of Colors this year.

What could it mean?","text":"Critics called \"Melania,\" the opulent and controversial documentary from Hollywood pariah Brett Ratner, an \"elaborate piece of designer taxidermy, horribly overpriced and ice-cold.\"\n\nThe Atlantic said that \"Ratner seems desperate to find action, but there is none\" in his quest to chronicle first lady Melania Trump's life in the 20 days leading up to her husband's second inauguration in January 2025. Variety's film critic argued that \"Melania,\" released in theaters Jan. 30, was \"a piece of state-sanctioned propaganda out of 1960s Communist China.\"\n\nAnd yet, the film still recorded a $7 million opening weekend, according to estimates Sunday, Feb. 1.\n\nMelania Trump documentary shocks at the box office\n\nThe movie's blockbuster status may represent the gap that continues to exist between Hollywood and President Donald Trump's grasp on his MAGA fan base.\n\nThe film's first weekend success is reminiscent of Trump's two electoral victories in 2016 and 2024, showing the family can provide shock at both the ballot box and the box office.\n\n'Melania' promised 'unprecedented access' into first lady's private world\n\nProduced by the first lady, \"Melania\" represented a comeback of sorts for embattled director Ratner, accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women – including A-list actress Olivia Munn – in 2017.\n\nAn official description called \"Melania\" an open window into \"the 20 days leading up to the 2025 Presidential Inauguration – through the eyes of the First Lady-elect herself,\" promising \"unprecedented access\" to moviegoers.\n\n'Melania' Trump movie reviews arrive: What critics are saying\n\nPresident Trump's own second term was a comeback of sorts for his family: He left office in 2021 after the events of Jan. 6, when rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, DC and several high-profile staff members left the former president's orbit. The Trumps retreated to Mar-A-Lago, the family's sprawling resort in West Palm Beach, Florida and lived their private lives.\n\nSurrounded by a slew of new friends and an army of remaining longtime loyalists, Trump again ran for president, beating Vice President Kamala Harris in November 2024. The first lady remained on the sidelines for most of the campaign, opting to focus on her only son, 19-year-old Barron.\n\nOn Inauguration Day, the following February, she recaptured the public's imagination. Trump donned a matching dark navy blue coat and skirt with a dramatic matching brimmed hat that covered her eyes. She paired the ensemble with matching heels and gloves.\n\n'Melania' surprises film industry with box office performance\n\nOver the past year, she has curated her own appearances, bucking tradition for political spouses. Trump is a member of a small but mighty group of American political spouses tending to the role in their own right.\n\nNew York City first lady Rama Duwaji, U.S. second lady Usha Vance and California first partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom have also taken their own approaches to media appearances and public outings.\n\nThe ultra-private first lady has appeared, though, at Pope Francis' funeral, Fourth of July festivities, the White House Easter Egg Roll and alongside her husband at other prominent events of national importance. \"Melania\" is the most expensive documentary in history, bought by billionaire Jeff Bezos' Amazon MGM Studios for $40 million, with an alleged $35 million spent on marketing. \n\nShe also launched her own production company, Muse Films, before the movie's theatrical release. The film is slated to stream on Amazon’s Prime Video service later this year.\n\nAlongside President Trump on Thursday, she walked the red carpet at the Trump Kennedy Center for the film's DC premiere, wearing a black Dolce & Gabbana buttoned skirt suit and skinny companion belt while the president was uniformed in his standard navy-blue suit and burgundy tie.\n\nHollywood ousted Brett Ratner. Is 'Melania' Trump movie his comeback?\n\nCelebrities including Nicki Minaj, Dr. Phil, Daphne Oz and former New York City Mayor Eric Adams attended the fête. Then on Friday, the film opened in theaters. The release, surpassing early projection numbers, came in third ($7 million) over the weekend, lagging behind a pair of horror films – survival comedy/thriller \"Send Help\" ($20 million) and indie scary movie \"Iron Lung\" ($17.9 million).\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, industry insiders slammed \"Melania\" with an awful 11% Tomatometer score. But audience tabulation using the website's Popcornmeter remains at a 99% approval rating, and the film boasted an \"A\" from audience-led CinemaScore measurements.\n\nThe film performed best in Trump strongholds like Florida and Texas. For a woman so shrouded in mystery of her own making, Trump seemingly always finds a way to surprise both fans and, yes, the critics.\n\nContributing: Anthony Robledo, Brian Truitt, Edward Segarra","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/02/01/melania-trump-movie-box-office/88464220007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2026/02/01/USAT/88465122007-2259143070.jpg?auto=webp&crop=5206,2929,x0,y900&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 21:27:49","author":"Usa Today","authors":["Usa Today"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.129},{"id":398396038,"title":"Dems can beat Trump on this key issue — they need to believe it","text":"Ever since Donald Trump rode down the escalator in 2015, attacking immigrants as drug smugglers and rapists, immigration has been his signature issue, often putting the Democrats on the defensive.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump's cruel policies of separating families at the border and his BS about Mexico paying for the wall contributed to his defeat in 2020. But the Biden administration had no answer for the flood of immigrants who then crossed the border, which Trump used as a cudgel during the 2024 campaign. Once again the issue was Trump’s and in his second term he’s decided to play hardball by, in effect, totally shutting down the border and deporting record numbers of immigrants.\n\nIt was working. While his handling of the economy tanked his poll numbers, immigration enforcement remained strong … until Minneapolis.\n\nThere, Trump overplayed his hand and did not stick to his argument to deport undocumented felons. Instead, he allowed the psychotic Stephen Miller to round up undocumented immigrants, non-felons and felons alike, with even some darker-skinned citizens (literally) tossed into the ICE detention centers.\n\nNot only is this a cruel and inhumane policy, but it’s also not what the American people, including the white working-class, want.\n\nFor different reasons, Trump and the Democrats seem oblivious to the fact that nearly two-thirds of the American people support “granting legal status to all illegal immigrants who have held jobs and paid taxes for at least three years and committed no felony crimes.”\n\nTrump doesn’t give a damn about these hard-working immigrants. He’s quite happy to support the MAGA “replacement theory” that calls for the protection of a white America from people of color. For Democrats, a pathway to citizenship is too hot to handle, making them look as if they support “illegals,” even if these undocumented immigrants are not felons. They fear Trump’s cudgel and ignore what the American people want.\n\nAccording to our YouGov survey of 3,000 voters in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, 63 percent support the “granting legal status” statement and only 37 percent oppose it.\n\nIn urban areas in these four states the support is massive:\n\nDemocrats: 91 percentIndependents: 73 percentRepublicans: 47 percent\n\nLooking at urban and non-urban areas combined, 36 percent of those who voted for Trump in 2024 supported this path to citizenship. And 81 percent of Hispanic voters supported it.\n\nWe also have 2020 data on the support of the white working class throughout the country, which shows that 62 percent supported this same exact “granting legal status” statement, up from 32 percent in 2010.\n\nIt’s as if Trump and the Democrats are stuck in 2010 and don’t realize that the working-class has great sympathy for hard working undocumented immigrants, especially in urban areas where day-day contact is greatest. That’s where nearly everyone comes into contact with immigrants who do so much of the hard labor that makes our economy function. Just 20 metro areas account for 60 percent of all undocumented immigrants.\n\nIt is politically explosive to send thousands of ICE and border agents into urban areas to randomly round up undocumented workers. Unless you are trying to foment an urban rebellion so you can send in troops to crush it in the name of law and order and cancel the midterms.\n\nWhat about the dangerous felons?\n\nThe Trump administration has deported each month approximately 1,100 undocumented immigrants with prior violent convictions, according the New York Times. I have no doubt that many Americans support their deportation if it is done in a reasonable way. But at the same time Miller’s shock troops have deported 2,100 immigrants with no criminal records per month. Per month!\n\nThat’s what happens when thousands of heavily armed mask-wearing troops invade an urban area, stopping people on the street and raiding houses of worship, businesses, and hospitals without court-approved search warrants. That’s not how you catch felons, that’s how you round up undocumented non-felons. That’s how you get away with stopping people based solely on their skin tone, not on any investigative information about criminal activity. And it shouldn’t be surprising that that’s not OK with much of the American people, something Trump slowly is realizing.\n\nWill Democrats come to the defense of undocumented workers?\n\nYou couldn’t ask for a better political moment given that Miller’s goons have killed two protesters in the last two weeks. This would be the perfect time to demand that ICE be prohibited from conducting any and all random stops throughout the country, and refrain from arresting any undocumented immigrants who have not committed a felony crime. And this is the time to call for a clear path to citizenship for hard working, non-felonious, undocumented workers.\n\nUndocumented workers need political champions, those with enough guts to call for an end to the dual labor market system in which undocumented workers live and work in the shadows and are exploited again and again. That’s not grandstanding. That’s setting a principled agenda for justice and fairness...\n\nBut there’s little indication that the Democratic Party is willing to go there. The political calculous is obvious: let Trump overplay his hand and hope the anger against him crests into a massive blue wave flooding the midterms. Why risk supporting a path to citizenship, which only will be thrown back at the Democrats declaring they are weak-kneed on immigration? Stopping Trump, the thinking goes, is more important than grandstanding about paths to citizenship given that the Democrats don’t have the votes to deliver. And besides, undocumented workers can’t vote, angry protestors can and will.\n\nBut here are two problems with this strategy. The first is that Trump will adjust the ICE invasions between now and November. He has to realize that rounding up felons requires a different, less visible approach that refrains from random searches and street brawls in urban areas. It should be obvious to Trump that Miller’s masked goons will cost the Republicans the midterms if the shock troops continue to roam the streets. White House border czar Tom Homans already is in Minneapolis, saying the shock troops will stand down, in some way, soon.\n\nThe second problem is that undocumented workers need political champions, those with enough guts to call for an end to the dual labor market system in which undocumented workers live and work in the shadows and are exploited again and again. That’s not grandstanding. That’s setting a principled agenda for justice and fairness, something that working people of all shades can connect with.\n\nThe anti-ICE protesters are leading the charge with the backing of a few state and local Democrats. But nationally the Democrats seem more comfortable talking about Jeffrey Epstein than protecting terrorized immigrants.\n\nThe Democrats may not have the nerve, but Dan Osborn, a working-class independent in Nebraska running for the U.S. Senate, sure does. Here’s how he put it:\n\n“I believe that undocumented workers, there should be a clear path for them to become documented or become legal status.”\n\nWe need some meaningful immigration reform. These people are our friends. They’re our neighbors. A lot of them have been here 30 years or more, and I think it’s time they get into Social Security already. There’s 80,000 open jobs in Nebraska that we can’t fill, that we can certainly use immigrant labor for.\n\nDid that kill Osborn's chances in his 2024 race? He lost by six points but ran 15 points ahead of Kamala Harris and he’s running again in 2026. He deserves our support.\n\nAnd, as Bruce Springsteen sings in the song he wrote last weekend, so do the people who are protecting “the stranger in our midst.”\n\nOh, our Minneapolis, I hear your voiceSinging through the bloody mistWe’ll take our stand for this landAnd the stranger in our midstHere in our home, they killed and roamedIn the winter of ‘26We’ll remember the names of those who diedOn the streets of Minneapolis","summary":"Ever since Donald Trump rode down the escalator in 2015, attacking immigrants as drug smugglers and rapists, immigration has been his signature issue, often putting the Democrats on the defensive.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump's cruel policies of separating families at the border and his BS about Mexico paying for the wall contributed to his defeat in 2020.

It also provides some political dynamite, all the more explosive because of Census Bureau statisticians’ deserved reputation for apolitical rigor and willingness to admit mistakes, as it did on the COVID-19-plagued 2020 census.\n\nThe headline story is the sharp rise and sharp fall in immigration. The notion that immigration exploded sharply during the Biden administration and contracted sharply during the second Trump administration is not political propaganda.\n\nAfter the expiration of most COVID-19 restrictions, immigration rose to 1.8 million in 2021-22, 2.6 million in 2022-23, and 3.2 million in 2023-24.\n\nThe snapback to 1.9 million in 2024-25 reflects changes in both outgoing and incoming administrations. With the election looming, the Biden administration in early 2024 discovered that current legislation let it restrict immigration in ways it had claimed it didn’t before, and under the same legislation, the Trump administration immediately stopped almost all illegal border crossings. Government policy can make a difference.\n\nTaking that into account, the Census Bureau estimates immigration will fall well below 500,000 in 2025-26. That’s comparable to the sharp falloff of immigration during the financial and economic crises of 2007-08.\n\nThat means the nation’s total population increase is sharply down, especially in the states centered on the nation’s four largest metropolitan areas, which either grew just barely (New York and Illinois) or lost population (California). Meanwhile, every state in the Midwest gained population, and five states grew above the national rate.\n\nEven more striking, 44% of the nation’s population gains in 2020-25 came in just the two states of Texas and Florida. When you add in North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, South Carolina—with the nation’s higher percentage growth in 2024-25—and Tennessee, you have 70% of the total national popular gain, all in states carried by Donald Trump in 2024.\n\nProjecting 2020-25 or 2024-25 patterns ahead of the 2030 census and the reapportionment of U.S. House seats among the states that automatically follows results in a sharp change of political balance. Two different projections have California losing four House seats and Texas gaining four, leaving California with 48, only marginally larger than Texas’ 42.\n\nOne has Florida gaining four and New York and Illinois losing two each, while the other has Florida gaining two and New York and Florida losing one each, with the same net partisan effect. There is agreement that five more or less Republican states will gain one seat each (Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Utah, and Idaho) and that five more or less Democrat states will lose one each—Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Oregon.\n\nApply either set of projections to the 2024 presidential election totals, and Trump gains either nine or 11 electoral votes—and wins even if he loses his three closest states, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. The blue wall has become a purple flowerbed.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Democrats will be frozen out of the White House. Changes in opinion of a magnitude often experienced can render the 2024 numbers obsolete. But one can see difficulties, even in 2028, if Democrats nominate one of the two California politicians, Gov. Gavin Newsom or former Vice President Kamala Harris, who top their polls. Will the nation be well served by policies that have prompted more people to leave than to head to a state with California’s beautiful scenery and comfortable climate?\n\nIt’s harder to be sure whether the 2030 census will give Republicans a boost in Congress. The current ructions over mid-decade redistricting make prediction perilous. An intermediate court has blocked Virginia Democrats from gerrymandering, and a trial judge has ruled that the Voting Rights Act requires linking a Staten Island-dominated district to Manhattan rather than Brooklyn.\n\nBut almost certainly any political redistricting would rather be a Republican adding multiple districts in Texas and Florida than a Democrat required to eliminate some of his party’s incumbents in California, New York, or Illinois. And heavily Democrat central cities will no longer be entitled to as much representation from masses of illegal immigrants protected from deportation but counted by census takers.\n\nA final caveat. Issues aren’t static, politicians aren’t around forever (even if Trump Derangement Syndrome sufferers fear that), and voters move around amid changes in the political landscape. The Trump era has been full of surprises—who thought he’d win in 2024 because of increased Latino support?—and the 2030s, when Trump won’t be president nor be running for president, will have its surprises for us too.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Kippley-Ogman defended her actions in an op-ed, declaring, “We cannot keep on with business as usual when our federal government is engaged in escalating state terror right here, right now.” The Headwaters Foundation has given $183,013 to Jewish Community Action, tax forms show.\n\nCTUL told supporters in a post to call its “worker defense hotline” if an employer “threatens you for taking the day off of work” to participate in the Jan. 23 marches. The organization received $1,085,750 from the Headwaters Foundation, tax filings show.\n\nUnidos MN, formerly called Navigate MN, is also hosting an upcoming “healthcare worker resistance training” in February to teach medical employees how to “protect” patients during ICE searches, an Instagram post shows. Unidos MN received $90,250 from the Headwaters Foundation.\n\nMinnesota Freedom Fund’s only Headwaters Foundation grant was for an unspecified amount. The fund also drew support in 2020 from former Vice President Kamala Harris, who encouraged the public to donate to bail out alleged Black Lives Matter rioters.\n\nThe Headwaters Foundation also gave at least $25,000 to Mizna, $385,000 to the Greater Minnesota Worker Center, $10,000 to the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, $171,000 to Voices for Racial Justice and $318,500 to OutFront Minnesota.\n\n‘Legal Observers’ And Riot Gear\n\nCOPAL, the Indigenous Protector Movement and MN8, formerly ReleaseMN8, advocate for so-called observers to follow immigration officials in person. (RELATED: Lawyers Have News For ICE Haters Who Think ‘Legal Observers’ Are Special)\n\nMN8 and COPAL have a text chat and hotline, respectively, that Minnesotans can use to summon observers during ICE encounters. An online “Constitutional Observer” handbook from COPAL tells readers to wear an identifying badge and film agents — but avoid physically interfering with arrests. The Headwaters Foundation awarded $360,000 for MN8 through the years and $10,000 for COPAL in January 2026.\n\n“As you document, demand that law enforcement present a signed judicial warrant,” reads the handbook. “While in many cases, they aren’t legally required to present the warrant, persist in asking.”\n\nGender Justice also invites viewers of its website to fill out a form for possible legal action if they have endured or witnessed “gender-based” mistreatment by immigration agents. The group has obtained “reports of agents calling women slurs and body shaming people” and “misgendering trans women,” among other allegations, its legal director claimed in Thursday testimony to the Minnesota Senate. The Headwaters Foundation gave $62,500 to Gender Justice.\n\nIn a Jan. 23 Instagram post, the Indigenous Protector Movement asked supporters to send money for gas masks, goggles, “legal observer vests” and other items for demonstrators. Border officials shot protester Alex Pretti dead in Minneapolis during a confrontation earlier that day.\n\n“Federal agents shot and killed a man this morning,” the Indigenous Protector Movement’s post said, referencing protester Alex Pretti’s fatal scuffle with law enforcement in Minneapolis earlier that day. “Community defenders are on the streets RIGHT NOW. SUPPLIES NEEDED IMMEDIATELY.” Another collaborator on the Instagram post was MN ICE Watch, which activist Renee Good was volunteering for when she was fatally shot by an ICE agent on Jan. 7.

The chapter received $140,000 from the Headwaters Foundation.\n\nAyada Leads also provides political campaign training and previously recruited Somali-born Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota to start running for public office, according to its website. Omar is a fierce critic of ICE’s Minnesota operations and was reluctant to condemn violence against agents in a Jan. 11 interview.\n\nAyada Leads and the Awood Center did not respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment. The Headwaters Foundation awarded $280,000 to Ayada Leads and $190,000 to the Awood Center.\n\nThe Awood Center seeks to hire a new employee for anti-ICE “rapid response,” the DCNF previously reported.

A humble Ratner told Breitbart News via a phone interview Saturday that he gives “all the credit” to the first lady, the film’s subject, for its extremely successful box office performance.\n\n“I have to give all the credit to Melania because this was something that she came up with, even, obviously, before she met me. The fact that she had hired a feature director like myself to do a documentary was very surprising, and for me as well. But she said to me from day one, I want this to be very cinematic. I want it to have a theatrical release. I want it to live and play in theaters,” Ratner told Breitbart News. “It’s very rare that documentaries get released in theaters. It’s usually straight to streaming, and even before they were streaming, documentaries were not in movie theaters – very, very rarely. So it was really her vision to have that and to see it through.”\n\n“And I think one of the strategies was to hire me, who does big feature films, for the movie theaters,” he continued. “I think, as planned, we designed this movie to really live and breathe inside a movie theater. You could watch it on streaming down the road, but I think the audience felt that too, and that’s why they showed up. They showed up for the theaters, but from the material, from the campaign, the trailers, you realize, ‘Wow, this is a big screen production. This isn’t just a kind of episodic documentary.'”\n\nThe film chronicles the first lady in the 20 days leading up to President Donald Trump’s second inauguration on January 20, 2025, which the first lady told Breitbart News on the red carpet at the documentary’s world premiere Thursday night was a “very intense” time.\n\nRatner has directed major feature-length films such as the Rush Hour trilogy (Rush Hour 4 is in the works), Red Dragon for the Hannibal series, Tower Heist, The Family Man, and more, and Melania marks his first-ever full-length documentary. He has joked to others that Melania is “the most expensive student film ever made,” and detailed for Breitbart News the nuances of not only filming a documentary, but one on such a unique subject as the first lady, compared to the feature-length films he has traditionally made.\n\n“I was learning as I was doing it. Honestly, it was a huge challenge. I always try to challenge myself. When I did Rush Hour, I was being offered a lot of movies like Rush Hour. I had felt that I had done it already. So I went and did the Family Man, which is a romantic fantasy,” he said. “After the Family Man, I went and did a psychological thriller, which was part of the Hannibal series: Red Dragon. Then I went ahead and did X-Men. So I worked in multiple genres, and documentary is one of the two genres that I’ve not tackled yet.”\n\n“I was always in the back of my mind, thinking, ‘God, if I was going to do a documentary, who would it be on, and what it would be about?’ I love biopics, and the truth is, this wasn’t a biopic. This was even more interesting, where it’s more wide-stream, mainstream, commercial, because it’s not just for a particular audience, anybody who’s interested in the role of the first lady, and that’s what we set out to do, to make a film that is specifically about that process. Nobody really knows or understands what the first lady does, so that for me was an interesting challenge and a great idea. I thought, ‘Wow, this is it. This is it. I should do it.’ For me, it was a huge challenge.”\n\nRatner told Breitbart News that Melania is likely the most difficult film he has ever undertaken, noting that in past movies, he had a script to follow, but in Melania, he was following the first lady’s real-life movements as they unfolded.\n\n[It’s] “probably the hardest film, because I’m used to going into a film with a specific script, with planning, pre-production, storyboards. Now I will say we got farther than we could because we’re with the first lady and the president, and the access that Melania gave me was completely unprecedented,” Ratner said. “I was given the information about their movements. It’s usually on a film I’m telling actors where to go, but in a documentary, I can’t do that. But because everything’s so organized and structured when they move around, I was given the diagram, say, or the plans, so I could get a little bit ahead of it, where, on a documentary, you’re just following them. You’re just kind of going along with them, and you’re grabbing what you can.”\n\n“I had a little bit more structure, and that’s why I was able to make it feel like a movie, you see, because I was able to kind of pre-plan it, knowing that when she left for the airport, and then went to the plane, and then from the plane to Trump Tower, I knew the path that she was going to take,” the Melania director continued. “I knew where the plane was going to be, or where the car was going to be, so I could send extra crews ahead of me to be waiting, so I could capture and focus on what I needed to focus on. So in that way, it was very much like a movie. I feel like, from at least the feedback I’m getting, it’s what I set out to do, but I didn’t really know if it was going to work, but I feel like it worked, and I kind of created a kind of almost a new genre of documentary film, not within itself, but within documentary.”\n\nWhen asked to compare working with the first lady to working with Hollywood actors, Ratner had extremely high praise for the documentary’s star, likening her awareness and on-camera presence to that of legendary actresses such as Grace Kelly and Bette Davis.\n\n“I’ve worked with some big stars, as you know, in a lot of my moveis and when people ask, I say, ‘Melania is actually what I think about what it would be like working with kind of a legendary actor,'” he told Breitbart News. “The young actors, when we’re filming a movie–say a beginning actor, an actor that I found or something that I put in a film when I was in theater, or we did commercials, you got to sort of walk them through the process where if I wanted to get to a mark, I put a mark on the ground. I put a piece of tape there. You’ve heard that saying ‘hitting your mark,’ so you kind of create a road map on the floor, but in a doc, I can’t do that. In a documentary, Melania as herself is going to walk where she wants to walk, and I can’t talk over her while she’s talking. It’s a different process.”\n\n“I was surprised of her awareness and sensitivity to the filmmaking process,” he added. “It’s like working with, I would say, a very experienced movie star like Bette Davis or Grace Kelly. They know where their light is. She knows how to turn towards the better light. She understands the camera, possibly because of her experience as a model. She has a relationship with the camera, and, without being self-conscious because she was always being herself, she was always conscientious, I would say, of the camera, of the lighting, of where she needed to stand when she was talking in a conversation, to clear the eye line for the camera to see her, to see her face, to see her eyes. If it was raining, for instance, in the scene at the cemetery, she would raise the umbrella two inches higher so that a light would hit her face underneath the umbrella. It felt like I was working with a real movie star.”\n\nThe first lady’s enigmatic nature was a key draw for Ratner’s decision to sign on to the project.\n\n“Melania has always been an enigma,” he said. “I met her once in the past, when she and her husband came to my premiere of my movie Tower Heist, which I filmed in one of Trump’s properties in Manhattan. So I just met her briefly, and I just knew what I read, like nobody really knew her and got to know her.”\n\nWhen asked about what he wants the film’s legacy to be, Ratner said he and the crew accomplished what they set out to do: to demonstrate not only the role of the first lady but also her passion for it, which they witnessed firsthand during the filming.\n\n“I’m very proud of the film, even if the box office didn’t hit it the way it did. I felt like I really succeeded because we premiered the movie at the Trump-Kennedy Center, and the audience, and the way they reacted to the film and spontaneously clapped or laughed–I’ve had some big premieres at the Chinese Theater in Hollywood, at the Ziegfeld in New York that I think doesn’t exist anymore–there was nothing like this premiere,” Ratner told Breitbart News. “The reaction was so big and so huge that I felt like, okay, even if I get bad reviews, even if it doesn’t do well at the box office, I feel like I’ve succeeded, because Melania and the president are very happy and proud of the film. But what I think it does more so is it does what we set out to do, which is show the role and the passion.”\n\n“What I learned about Melania from the process, from making the film, is that as passionate as I am about filmmaking, she is about her role as the first lady in her service,” he added. “I was there the moment she would wake up to the moment she would go to sleep every day for a month, say. In between, I would have to take a break, my crew would go to lunch, we would have different things that we needed to do, change a piece of equipment out; there were breaks. On those breaks, she wasn’t taking a nap. She wasn’t just sitting there waiting for us to keep shooting, which a lot of actors on set are kind of waiting to act. That’s their main job. She took her role as the first lady; she takes it so seriously. I wanted to have a second crew filming when I couldn’t film, when I was down for the in-between, because the in-between is as active as the on-camera stuff. Her meetings that she was having in between being in the film were as intense, and as busy, and as important. People talk about the president not sleeping; her days are long and her sleep time is short, but she’s working at every waking moment, and that I really was happy, not only to show in the film, but to learn that about how serious she is about the role of the first lady.”\n\nPresident Trump’s respect for his wife was also apparent to Ratner throughout the process.\n\n“The second thing I learned really was the amount of respect that the president has for her,” he told Breitbart News. “He has the utmost respect for her and really listens. She has a real opinion, and he really respects it, as you see in the trailer and in the film, when he’s doing his speech, and she weighs in on it. Not that it wasn’t expected, but you don’t know people, you don’t know the dynamics. I was very, very moved by the amount of respect that he has for his wife, and it’s mutual, by the way.”\n\nWhile discussing an upcoming three-part series to follow up on the documentary, Ratner underscored that he had a firsthand perspective throughout the project of the first lady and the president’s humanity and compassion.\n\n“The president was always a fantastic subject to film and very real,” he explained. “What I learned is their humanity and their compassion for people. I don’t want to give away what’s in the series, but I saw them interacting with some victims of disasters. You know when people are there sometimes, like when Kamala Harris, in the film, was at the inauguration, and she didn’t want to be there because she was looking at her watch? The president, when he’s speaking with somebody, he is present, he is looking you in the eye, and the same with Melania.”\n\nRatner assembled an all-star crew for the film, including, as producer Marc Beckman emphasized to Sirius XM’s Breitbart News Daily, several Oscar-winning cinematographers: Jeff Cronenweth, Barry Peterson, and Dante Spinotti. Ratner lauded the crew during his interview with Breitbart News on Saturday and singled out Assistant Director Michael Kahn, who has run the sets of some of Hollywood’s biggest films, including the Lethal Weapon and Die Hard franchises, as well as David Fincher’s Seven. Ratner noted the president loved seeing Kahn during the documentary’s production.\n\n“What was so great about Michael Kahn is he eats, breathes, and walks Donald Trump,” Ratner said. “He’s the most loyal Donald Trump fan on planet Earth, and the minute that the president met him, it was like a love – it was like birds were flying. The president would always acknowledge him. And so we got a lot of stuff done because I picked the best AD assistant director, because Michael was a force. I mean, he walks in with his MAGA hat, he comes in there, and when the president’s in the room and sees him, it brightens his day. It really does.”\n\nHe added that “it was great to see the appreciation the president had for my crew, and Michael was one of those guys.”\n\nRatner is embarking on Rush Hour 4 for his next project. When asked whether it would be more difficult to make a traditional film given Hollywood’s left-leaning politics, Ratner said he believes Hollywood is growing and he is happy where it is currently.\n\n“Hollywood is growing in a way, and I’m happy where it’s at right now, and it gives me an opportunity to come back, and all I am is about the work. I don’t really get into the politics of things,” he said. “My dream from when I was eight years old was to make movies, and that’s really all I care about, and that’s what I was always focused on. So when everything started becoming political, or all this stuff came into play, it was frustrating on many levels for me. So I’m very happy with where Hollywood is, and a lot of great people. You see changes with the new owners at Paramount and a lot of these big studios, and it’s a different world than it was 10 years ago.”","summary":"\"Melania\" documentary film director Brett Ratner told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that First Lady Melania Trump deserves \"all the credit\" for the picture's historic opening weekend success.\n\n\nThe post Exclusive: ‘Melania’ Director Brett Ratner Gives First Lady ‘All the Credit’ for Documentary’s Opening Weekend Success appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2026/02/01/exclusive-melania-director-brett-ratner-gives-first-lady-all-the-credit-for-documentarys-opening-weekend-success/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/02/bratnermelaniaT-640x335.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 15:48:49","author":"Nick Gilbertson","authors":["Nick Gilbertson"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.087},{"id":398354792,"title":"Democrat flips Texas Senate seat, will represent district Trump previously won","text":"Democrat Taylor Rehmet won a special election for the Texas state Senate on Jan. 31, flipping a district blue that President Donald Trump won by 17 percentage points in the 2024 presidential election against Kamala Harris.\n\nRehmet, a veteran and labor union leader, defeated Republican activist and entrepreneur Leigh Wambsganss to represent Texas' 9th Senate district, located in the Fort Worth area.\n\n“This win goes to everyday working people,” Rehmet told supporters, according to multiple reports.\n\nTrump had backed Wambsganss in the race, urging voters in the district in a post on Truth Social to \"GET OUT AND VOTE for a phenomenal Candidate.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside Mar-a-Lago on Feb. 1, Trump distanced himself from the Texas GOP loss, saying “I’m not involved with that.”\n\n“I'm not on the ballot,” the president said. “So, you don't know whether or not it's transferable, but you put the Democrats in, you'll end up with open borders again.”\n\nThe Democratic National Committee in a statement said the state Senate win \"is another sign that Democrats have the momentum heading into November,\" referring to the midterm elections that could shift the balance of power in Washington later this year.\n\nDemocrat wins US House of Representatives seat\n\nThe state Senate race wasn't the only victory Democrats notched over the weekend.

In the 2024 presidential election, then-Vice President Harris won the district over Trump by 69%-29%.\n\nRepublicans hold a 218-213 majority in the House, an already close margin that will narrow to 218-214 once Menefee takes office. Other House vacancies are also slated to be filled later this year, with special elections planned for Georgia, New Jersey and California in March, April and August, respectively.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, already faced difficulties getting legislation across the finish line with the current GOP majority.\n\nMenefee is expected to be sworn in quickly, but it's not certain.

The U.S. House district has been vacant most of the past year following the March 2025 death of Representative Sylvester Turner, who served only two months.\n\nThe election came after Menefee and Edwards were the top two vote receivers from a group of 16 candidates last November. As part of Congress, Menefee could face voting on controversial issues in coming weeks. Legislation imposing tougher operating procedures on federal immigration agents in Minneapolis and other cities throughout the nation and an attempt to reinstate a federal health insurance subsidy remain priorities for lawmakers.\n\nThese potential legislations could be among several items decided by tight votes. The issue of federal immigration action specifically has been repeatedly challenged following two separate shooting deaths in Minneapolis at the hands of federal officials.\n\nMore: Judge declines to halt ICE actions in Minnesota.

They are, for all intents and purposes, the property of the Taliban. They have no equal rights under the law, because they have no rights, period. They aren't even considered human beings. The Left hasn't missed a chance to cosplay about The Handmaid's Tale, while the women of Afghanistan are living in a hellish version of Gilead, thanks to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\n\nIsn't Islam grand?\n\nFor the better part of three years, we were treated to campus protests and members of the Squad screaming about a genocide in Israel. I'll note that in Israel, women are allowed to be doctors and women are allowed to go to doctors. There won't be any campus demonstrations. Rashida Tlaib won't hold up a sign at the State of the Union address.\n\nNo one will ask Kamala or Joe about the plight of these women, either. Kamala won't care, and Joe won't remember that Afghanistan is even a country. But make no mistake: the current conditions being endured by the women and girls of Afghanistan are on them, which is ironic, given how those two loved to tout their pro-woman bona fides. \n\nShortly before Biden left office, he (well, whatever intern drew the short straw that day) tried to add the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution via X post. \n\n\"I have supported the Equal Rights Amendment for more than 50 years and have long been clear that no one should be discriminated against based on their sex,\" his post read. \"We must affirm and protect women's full equality once and for all.\"\n\nKamala said something similar, adding, \"I have spent my career fighting for freedoms and to expand opportunities for women and girls. It has always been clear that when we lift up women, we lift up children, families, communities, and all of society.\"\n\nThat equality, those rights and freedoms, apparently don't apply to the women and girls of Afghanistan. \n\nIf healthcare is truly a human right (it's not), and if women are deserving of dignity and equality (they are), then the women and girls of Afghanistan are living under one of the most brutal, human rights-violating regimes on earth. And the people who claim to care the most are nowhere to be found. The Democrats' feminism, as well as their definition of women's rights and their moral courage, ends at America's borders, it seems. The women and girls of Afghanistan weren't forgotten by accident. They were abandoned by choice.\n\nAnd that's a shame.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/amy-curtis/2026/02/01/sun-vip-afghan-women-doctors-n2670407","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2018/293/39451274-1f20-4e5c-b973-448431b4030b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 15:00:00","author":"Amy Curtis","authors":["Amy Curtis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.074},{"id":398352406,"title":"How the Fulton County raid is giving Sidney Powell an encore","text":"Ed Martin, the former acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, failed-up to the Justice Department last year when it became clear that he could not be confirmed to his position by the Senate. He serves today as Donald Trump’s pardon attorney, but Martin also dabbles in other projects for the president, who reportedly speaks to him frequently on the phone. Martin made a little news on Thursday when he wrote “Good Morning, America, How are ya?”on X above a photo of himself with Sidney Powell, the notorious election denier who pled guilty in 2023 to six misdemeanors of election interference. The significance of the troll was clear: MAGA’s “Big Lie” has returned.\n\nIn a now-infamous White House meeting in December 2020, Powell — along with former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn — attempted to convince Trump to name her as special counsel to investigate voter fraud. Lawyers from the White House Counsel’s Office frantically tried to prevent such a move, along with another of Powell’s proposals: to declare a national security emergency and seize voting machines due to what she alleged had been mass foreign interference. (In January, Trump told the New York Times that he regretted not doing so.) \n\nIn the end, the president did not take such action. But Trump has never stopped falsely accusing Joe Biden and Democrats of stealing the 2020 presidential election from him, so it’s been easy to just chalk up his more recent whining to yet another silly obsession along the lines of low-flow showers and windmills. But in his Jan. 21 speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the president said that prosecutions were coming. Since there is no degree of separation between him and his personal law firm — the Justice Department — people should have known that something was afoot. On Wednesday it became clear what that was: The FBI raided the elections office in Fulton County, Georgia, and reportedly seized all the 2020 ballots.\n\nThe state’s election board, which has been packed with MAGA loyalists, had also been trying to obtain the ballots and other documents, and they appealed to the Justice Department for assistance. The objective seems to be to take over the election system from the county and install GOP apparatchiks to take charge of the voting system. Presumably the mere fact of an FBI “investigation” could be the pretext for such a move. Republicans are eager to topple Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, who is up for reelection in 2026 — a race that could decide control of the Senate and the fate of the remainder of Trump’s second term. They aren’t taking any chances.\n\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department has been filing lawsuits against states Trump lost in 2020 for refusing to provide the federal government with voter rolls, which they are not required to do. Attorney General Pam Bondi even tried to extort the list from Minnesota by suggesting that the administration might call off Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s occupation of Minneapolis if they agreed to turn it over. \n\nSidney Powell’s symbolic reemergence could also help explain why Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was spotted lurking about the Fulton County election office during the FBI raid. At first glance, it would seem odd; her job is to coordinate intelligence between a variety of government agencies. But according to the Wall Street Journal, Trump has tasked her with leading “an administration-wide effort to hunt for proof of tampering” in the 2020 election. \n\nGabbard has been completely absent from all public discussion of Venezuela, Iran, Ukraine and Greenland, but she did come up with a supposed bombshell last July: She alleged that former President Barack Obama staged a “treasonous conspiracy” by claiming that Russia tried to influence the 2016 election. (Bondi has actually assigned a special prosecutor, located in the Southern District of Florida, to investigate those outlandish claims.) Gabbard’s involvement indicates that they may be looking at Powell’s inane foreign interference charges that have been floating around the Dominion and Smartmatic voting machine lawsuits for years, which falsely claimed that the two corporations were in fact secret Venezuelan companies. \n\nWant more sharp takes on politics? Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only, written by Amanda Marcotte, now also a weekly show on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nOne of the main conspiracy theories circulating in the right-wing fever swamps is that former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is ready to spill the beans about his country’s interference in the election. As Benny Johnson, a MAGA provocateur with close ties to the White House, put it, “This is why you see the globalists around the world bricking in their pants — they’re terrified because Venezuela was ground zero for election theft.” If there’s anyone in the Trump administration willing to run with that, it’s Tulsi Gabbard. At this point, it appears to be her only responsibility. \n\nDonald Trump is surely the sorest loser in world history — and that is not hyperbole. Considering the power he wields, it is literally true. Even if he actually believed that he won, any normal human would let it go and simply revel in the fact that he got the last laugh when he beat his nemeses — Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Democrats, the mainstream media — in the next election and returned to the White House in triumph from his Mar-a-Lago exile. But no, he is a malignant narcissist who cannot stand the fact that he lost something and is driven to “prove” that he was right all along, which is impossible to do since he was wrong. \n\nSo now he’s got Gabbard, Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel on the case, and with the guiding spirit of Sidney Powell, they are on a mission to “find” those 11,000 votes that he so notoriously begged Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to find for him back in 2020. No one should be surprised if they magically turn up now that they are in the hands of Patel and Bondi’s FBI. \n\nTrump, no doubt, would be happy to pardon Maduro if he were willing to testify that he somehow facilitated Biden’s victory in 2020. It doesn’t have to make sense, and there doesn’t need to be any believable proof. If Bondi and Patel can bring some cases that actually result in a real trial, then all the better.\n\nBut this is not just an ego-soothing exercise for the president. The Republican Party is attempting to use its power and Trump’s Big Lie to build a voting system in Georgia and other states that will give the GOP a permanent electoral advantage. \n\nSidney Powell had reason to smile in her picture with Martin. Events are going her way. And with the Supreme Court finally poised to fulfill Chief Justice John Roberts’ fondest dream of overturning the Voting Rights Act, they will have gone a long way toward achieving that. It’s their holy grail and they’ve never been closer to getting it.","summary":"The wild conspiracy theories of Trump's former attorney are driving the new federal probe into the \"Big Lie\"","url":"https://www.salon.com/2026/02/01/how-the-fulton-county-raid-is-giving-sidney-powell-an-encore/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2022/12/sidney_powell_1229768128-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 14:25:05","author":"Heather Digby Parton","authors":["Heather Digby Parton"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.499},{"id":398310600,"title":"“Melania” Is as Vacuous as Its Subject","text":"It’s darkly fitting that “Melania,” the new $75 million snoozefest from Amazon about America’s first lady, was released in theaters the same day her husband’s Justice Department dropped 3 million pages of documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. As we now know, Epstein and Donald Trump were bosom buddies for years, and the grim specter of that relationship hangs over “Melania.”\n\nThe movie’s director is Brett Ratner, who six women accused of sexual assault or harassment in 2017, including one alleged victim who was 19 at the time. Ratner has been biding his time in Israel, where he has reportedly become friendly with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIn what one would hope is enough to undo Amazon’s $35 million “Melania” marketing budget, Ratner is also in the new batch of Epstein files: There are photos of him and Epstein embracing two women whose identities are redacted. An earlier Epstein document dump included a photo where Ratner hugs the shirtless torso of Jean-Luc Brunel, the French modeling agent and Epstein associate who died in prison facing multiple charges of rape and sexual assault, including of a minor under the age of 15.\n\nIt’s hard not to watch “Melania” with all that context top of mind. It’s a big, nasty club, and we’re not in it, thankfully.\n\nThis film opens by putting too fine a point on all of it. The camera pans expansively over the ocean and the beach before arriving at Mar-a-Lago and Melania Trump’s red-bottomed heels. She boards a motorcade to travel to New York City, and the chorus of the Rolling Stones’ “Gimme Shelter” plays: “Rape, murder, it’s just a shot away.” (That song was famously used to great effect in Martin Scorsese’s “Casino” and “Goodfellas,” films in which criminal psychopaths meet their demise after stealing and assaulting everyone in sight in service of personal enrichment and their depraved sense of morality.)\n\nWhat follows is an hour and 44-minute-long lifestyle infomercial about a public figure with all the charisma and intrigue of eggshell-white paint drying. (We are reminded multiple times throughout the movie, as a tie-in with its marketing campaign, that the first lady loves the colors black and white, which are also the colors of Regal Cinemas’ novelty popcorn bucket for its release.) \n\nMelania is seen trying on a multitude of outfits ahead of her husband’s second inauguration, with festivities that include no fewer than three different balls, along with a ghoul-studded candlelight dinner. At that fete, the president’s table is a who’s who of his donors and scions of industry: There are three separate shots of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his wife Lauren Sanchez. Bezos sits next to Miriam Adelson, the arch-conservative megadonor, and Trump cheerleader Elon Musk is there, too, caught on video as a brunette swoops in to sit on his lap. (For his part, Musk is also in the latest tranche of Epstein emails, asking the sex trafficker in November 2012, “What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?”) Mark Zuckerberg, whose company, Meta, donated $1 million to the president’s inauguration fund, doesn’t appear until the inauguration luncheon, but he still shows up.\n\nMelania glides over it all, her unlined face impassive and unaffected, which creates a genuinely disquieting effect. Rather than an intimate portrait of a misunderstood woman — tellingly, the tagline for the movie is simply “A new film,” which is about as much as you can truthfully say about it — we’re treated to platitude after platitude in voiceover narration by the first lady. \n\nMelania admits she’s a fan of AI; The audiobook of her memoir, also called “Melania,” is read by an AI replica of her voice. Most of her lukewarm observations feel like they could be AI-generated as well. Among them are statements so generic they achieve utter meaninglessness: “I felt the weight of history,” “Freedom is not free,” and “I honor the importance of the White House.” Describing the coat she wore for the inauguration, she states: “I want to feel like it’s a coat.” “Melania” is a stunning document, if only for its ability to say so little despite what we’re informed is unprecedented access.\n\n“Everyone wants to know” what it’s like becoming first lady again, Melania says early on in the movie. But if early ticket sales are any indication against its massively bloated budget, she has a generous definition of “everyone.” I saw the movie on opening night at Alamo Drafthouse in Brooklyn, admittedly far from MAGA America, with a mere nine strangers. Other than a few “ooohs” from my seatmate when Melania tried on a new dress, only the appearance of her husband got any reaction from the assembled faithful, who laughed easily whenever Trump said anything. The biggest laugh came from shots of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris waiting out of public view before the inauguration, where Harris’s face is furrowed in disbelief, and of the mad dash to move out anything the Bidens might have touched before the Trumps arrive back at the White House. \n\nThe first time Melania and Trump are onscreen together, he greets her as she disembarks from a private jet emblazoned with TRUMP in all-capital letters. It appears that they’re going to shake hands before ultimately pivoting to an embrace. Their warmth is captured elsewhere, like when Trump calls his wife to tell her the final Electoral College totals that usher him into the White House once again. “That’s a good one,” Melania says without mirth. “Bye, congrats.”\n\nAll other efforts to humanize Melania fall similarly flat. You can practically see the boxes being checked off as they’re fulfilled on screen. She is a mother who bizarrely praises Barron Trump’s “composure” and calls him “very confident” as the song “It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World” plays. (On the campaign trail in 2016, Donald Trump memorably referred to Barron as “her son.”) \n\n“Being hand in hand with my husband in this moment is very emotional,” she tells us in voiceover. “Nobody has endured what he has over the past few years. People tried to murder him, incarcerate him, slander him, and here he is. I’m so very proud.”\n\nThe lack of self-awareness is positively nauseating, and this feeling is only moderated slightly by the sheer tediousness of approving table designs, invitations, and other window-dressing.\n\nMelania also cares deeply about “the children.” (It is perhaps worth noting that she began her modeling career at 16.) On a video call with French first lady Brigitte Macron where she talks about her “Be Best” anti-bullying initiative, she makes the note “no phones till 11,” a Macron recommendation, on a “Be Best”-branded notepad (Bezos for some reason is also seen on screen as part of the call, which goes unremarked upon.) While watching news coverage of the Los Angeles wildfires, a vaguely misty-eyed Melania says in voiceover, “I think about the families, the children who have lost everything.” Crucially, this sympathy does not seem to extend to children killed by her husband’s bombs in Gaza.\n\nMelania at one point meets with an Israeli woman, Aviva Siegel, who was captured on October 7 and held hostage by Hamas. She was initially freed but forced to leave her husband, Keith, behind. (He was released on February 1, 2025, as part of the ceasefire deal.) “I would pray that he doesn’t suffer,” Melania tells her, with all the sympathy of a woman eyeing a damaged piece of produce. “I will always use my influence and power to fight for those in need,” she sums up the experience in voiceover.\n\nBut Ratner goes to great lengths to convince us that Melania is also fun, even a little goofy. This does not work in the slightest. At a victory event with Trump supporters at the D.C. Capital One Arena, Melania is seen dancing ever-so-slightly to the Trump campaign mainstay “YMCA,” but only as she leaves the stage; Trump does not join in. From behind sunglasses in a black SUV, Melania tells us, somewhat concerningly, that Michael Jackson is her favorite musician, and that she and Donald met him in New York. “Billie Jean” plays on the car’s sound system, and Melania lightly sings along, including to the line, “Be careful of who you love,” but any deeper meaning is lost on all parties involved.\n\nMoments like these have led some to fall for the gag, and even to suggest that Ratner is making a slyly anti-Trump movie, which couldn’t be further from the truth. He’s a sycophant to his core, after Melania and Trump finally return to the White House after a great many parties, Ratner coos from off-camera: “Sweet dreams, Mr. President.”\n\n(As a reward for his obsequiousness, Ratner is slated to direct “Rush Hour 4,” the buddy-cop series that’s reportedly being revived after Trump personally leaned on Larry Ellison, a Trump supporter and media mogul who now owns Paramount, which is set to distribute the film.)\n\nAs the movie mercifully draws to a close, Melania once again returns to the children, who are our future. “With the celebrations behind us, the first day of my husband’s second term has arrived. There is much to accomplish in the next four years,” she says like a threat. “Children will always remain my priority. … I will move forward with purpose and, of course, with style.”\n\nMoving forward, of course, means a regime of mass deportation and the trampling of our civil rights, all right in front of our faces. Her husband has ushered in an era where the unencumbered American id rules, one in which avarice, flagrant corruption, and clear bribery are the animating forces of a nation and a people. In that sense, the vacuousness of “Melania” perfectly captures the meaner, more selfish world we live in now. After all, it’s always been about Trump — not us, and certainly not Melania — despite any $75 million effort to convince us otherwise.","url":"https://theintercept.com/2026/02/01/melania-trump-movie-review/","image":"https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2258351915-e1769897018670.jpg?fit=6810%2C3405","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 14:25:01","author":"Katherine Krueger","authors":["Katherine Krueger"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.292},{"id":398302004,"title":"Christian Menefee’s victory seen as boost for Democrats in Texas","text":"By Richard Cowan and Robin Respaut\n\nWashington ― Democrat Christian Menefee won a Texas special election for the US House of Representatives on Saturday, the Associated Press reported, a result that will narrow Republicans’ already slender majority in the chamber.\n\nDemocrats Menefee, a former Harris County attorney, and Amanda Edwards, a former Houston city council member, were vying in a runoff to represent Texas’ 18th Congressional District, a solidly Democratic area encompassing much of the inner city of Houston and the surrounding region.\n\nThe Texas secretary of state did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for confirmation of the election results.\n\nCongressional election\n\nThis election does not provide insight into which party might prevail in November’s midterm congressional election. In the 2024 presidential election, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris won the district over Republican Donald Trump by 69%-29%. \n\nBut in a race for the Texas State Senate on Saturday, Democrat Taylor Rehmet won a special election, flipping a district that Trump had won by 17 percentage points in 2024. \n\n“This victory is another sign that Democrats have the momentum heading into November,” the Democratic National Committee said in a statement. The Texas secretary of state and the Republican Party in Texas did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment on the state race. In the US House, Republicans hold a 218-213 majority. Democrats will insist upon a prompt swearing-in for Menefee, tightening the Republican lead to 218-214. \n\nThree House vacancies in Georgia, New Jersey and California are scheduled to be filled by special elections in March, April and August, respectively.\n\nLast year, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, enraged Democrats when he delayed the swearing-in of now-Representative Adelita Grijalva after a special election in Arizona. She won that contest in September but was not sworn in until mid-November.\n\nVote-getters\n\nThe US House district has been vacant most of the past year. Menefee will replace the late Representative Sylvester Turner, who served only two months before his death in March.\n\nMenefee and Edwards were the top two vote-getters in a field of 16 candidates in last November’s election, requiring Saturday’s runoff.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Congress could vote on contentious issues, including legislation that would impose tougher operating procedures on federal immigration agents in Minneapolis and other cities throughout the nation. An attempt to reinstate a federal health insurance subsidy also remains a priority for many legislators.\n\nBoth measures, if they materialise, could be among several items decided by tight votes.\n\nDemocrats have fared well in special elections since the beginning of last year, boosting the party’s hopes of winning control of the House in November’s midterm congressional elections, especially given Trump’s popularity at the moment.\n\nAll 435 House seats will be up for grabs in November. The party that holds the White House typically loses seats in the midterms.","url":"https://www.businessday.co.za/world/americas/2026-02-01-christian-menefees-victory-seen-as-boost-for-democrats-in-texas/","image":"https://www.businessday.co.za/resizer/v2/BACE4ZJ7GRE5FFM55XRUKMY3OE.jpg?auth=7f423140400fefafae090039b3f5c399de92703dd2406ddf983e82997eaa78b8","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 13:50:54","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"za","sentiment":-0.568},{"id":398305216,"title":"Scoop Up the Excitement: Former Ben & Jerry’s Co-Founder Launches an Irresistible New Ice Cream Flavor","text":"In a spirited announcement, Ben Cohen, cofounder of Ben & Jerry’s, introduced his latest ice cream flavor with a call to action: “We must all rise to protest because Minneapolis’s struggle is now a national one.”\n\n“The flavor I’m making today is called ‘The Maxi Hearts of Minneapolis,’” Cohen stated in a video. “Amidst all the horror and sadness, I’m encouraged by the spirit of Minneapolis. Finally, a community that’s standing up and putting their bodies on the line for compassion and decency and justice.”\n\nThe ice cream’s foundation combines coconut and passion fruit, flavors Cohen highlights as being favored by the immigrant community. The treat is enhanced with three types of heart-shaped mix-ins: salted caramel, chocolate, and red hearts. Cohen explains that the caramel hearts signify the tears shed for Renee and Alex and the hard work that will be done in their honor for justice. The chocolate hearts represent the love that will fuel this effort, while the red hearts symbolize the collective empathy from people across the country towards Renee and Alex’s families and friends.\n\nEmblazoned on the ice cream package is a heartfelt tribute: “This flavor honors the resilience and spirit of Minneapolis’s people, who lead with empathy and courage in the fight for justice. We especially remember Renee and Alex, who fell victim to the masked, heavily armed agents of ICE.”\n\nCohen used the launch to voice his stance, stating, “ICE operates as a rogue, unconstitutional paramilitary force infringing on our rights. It needs to be defunded and dismantled.”\n\nClarifying the distinction between his personal activism and the corporate brand, Cohen stated, “This is a Ben’s Best flavor, not a Ben & Jerry’s product, as even Ben & Jerry’s faces constraints they cannot speak of, so I will.”\n\nIn the past, politically charged ice cream flavors linked to Cohen or the Ben & Jerry’s name include “Justice ReMix’d,” advocating for prison reform; “Change Is Brewing,” supporting Rep. Cori Bush’s policing legislation; “Kamala’s Coconut Jubilee,” part of a voter outreach campaign for Vice President Kamala Harris; and “Bernie’s Back,” a cinnamon-and-chocolate homage to Bernie Sanders crafted by Cohen as a limited edition.\n\nBen Cohen and Jerry Greenfield co‑founded Ben & Jerry’s and sold the company to Unilever in 2000 under a unique governance agreement intended to preserve its social mission. In 2025, Greenfield publicly left the brand, citing Unilever’s alleged silencing of its values and independence. That same year, Cohen attempted to repurchase the company, but Unilever declined to sell. The company has since spun off its ice cream assets into a new, standalone entity called the Magnum Ice Cream Company.\n\nThe flavor Maxi Hearts of Minneapolis references two recent lethal incidents. Renee Good was shot on January 7 after allegedly accelerating her vehicle toward an ICE agent during an enforcement operation in Minneapolis. Federal authorities have stated the vehicle was used as a weapon, while her partner, Becca Good, is reportedly under investigation for potentially impeding federal officers. Video footage shows Becca challenging agents before the shots were fired, with some suggesting she encouraged Renee to “drive,” though others dispute the clarity of her words.\n\nAlex Pretti was killed by federal agents on January 24 in a separate incident. Days earlier, he was recorded on video yelling profanities at agents, calling them “trash,” and daring them to assault him. Federal immigration officers had reportedly documented information about Pretti before the shooting. He brought a firearm with him on January 24, the day he was fatally shot.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn a spirited announcement, Ben Cohen, cofounder of Ben &#38; Jerry&#8217;s, introduced&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Scoop Up the Excitement: Former Ben &amp; Jerry’s Co-Founder Launches an Irresistible New Ice Cream Flavor first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/scoop-up-the-excitement-former-ben-jerrys-co-founder-launches-an-irresistible-new-ice-cream-flavor/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Former-Ben-Jerrys-Cofounder-Debuts-Newest-Ice-Cream-Flavor.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 13:47:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.065},{"id":398309286,"title":"2028 Presidential Winning Odds: Vance Drops to 26% as Newsom Reaches 20%","text":"The 2028 US presidential election market is showing a huge change in public sentiment, with JD Vance's chances now at 26% and California Governor Gavin Newsom closing in at 20%. Data from the prediction markets reveal a surge in trading volume and interest, suggesting voters and speculators are reassessing the early frontrunners.The market reflects a high level of volatility, with smaller candidates like Marco Rubio and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also registering attention. Early polling and market activity can provide insight into broader public opinion, but the results remain speculative until closer to the November 2028 vote.JD Vance Drops, Newsom RisesUS Vice President, JD Vance remains the front-runner according to Polymarket. His 26% probability reflects both investor confidence and speculative bets, but it represents a decline from previous months when he was trading at 31%.Vance's market lead translates to £4.7m ($5.6 million) in traded contracts. Analysts suggest that while he retains a lead, early polling swings means there's a tightening race between him and California Governor, Gavin Newsom.Newsom, currently at 20% on the market, has been steadily climbing as interest grows over his potential nationwide appeal beyond California. He was previously at 18% at the time Vance was at 31%.Market data shows £3.2m ($3.8 million) in active trades, indicating a growing investor interest in the Democratic governor. This suggest that Newsom's rise could mean positive media attention, which will be helpful, particularly in battleground states that could be crucial for the 2028 outcome.Smaller Candidates Show Unexpected InterestOther candidates are also seeing measurable trading volume, despite low odds. Marco Rubio sits at 9.3%, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at 6% and Josh Shapiro at 4%. Public figures from outside traditional politics, such as Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and Elon Musk, are listed at around 1%. The market collectively has processed over $240 million (£201m) in total volume, a mix of both investor and public engagement.Is Market Prediction Equivalent to Actual Win?Prediction markets do not guarantee an actual win, but they often provide a reliable signal of likely outcomes by aggregating traders' collective expectations. Early markets often respond to news cycles and social media narratives rather than concrete voter intention.Early volatility, particularly with over 20 candidates listed, can exaggerate perceived gains or losses for frontrunners. This election market resolves based on official calls from major outlets such as the Associated Press, Fox News and NBC, or the inauguration result on Jan. 20, 2029.Traders buy 'Yes' or 'No', depending on which candidate they think will win. The price of each contract effectively mirrors the market's probability for that candidate.However, there are historical examples that show how prediction markets can often be aligned with actual results. The Iowa Electronic Markets, one of the oldest political prediction markets, predicted Barack Obama's victory in the 2008 US presidential election with an implied probability close to his eventual vote share and performed more accurately than many traditional polls in several cycles.US Presidential Elections 2028The 2028 United States presidential election is scheduled for Nov. 7, 2028, with parties preparing for extended primary battles. On the Republican side, Vice‑President J.D. Vance is currently seen as the frontrunner to secure the GOP nomination, with markets showing him well ahead of rivals like Marco Rubio and Ron DeSantis in early odds.On the Democratic side, California Governor Gavin Newsom is emerging as an early favourite for the nomination, although figures such as Alexandria Ocasio‑Cortez, Pete Buttigieg and former Vice‑President Kamala Harris remain in contention.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/2028-presidential-winning-odds-vance-drops-26-newsom-reaches-20-1775382","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1768684/vice-president-jd-vance.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=180d2d73a467e22e635de80e52f4421f","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 13:37:39","author":"Thea Felicity","authors":["Thea Felicity"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.19},{"id":398297402,"title":"The New York Times hardcover bestseller list, week ended Jan. 17","text":"An asterisk (*) indicates that a book’s sales were barely distinguishable from those of the book above.

But the mayor of the state’s third-largest city has shaken up the most wide-open California governor’s race in decades.\n\nPolitical experts said San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan’s entrance into the race last week likely will force a reckoning among fellow Democrats and their donors about nudging some of their now nine contending candidates to step aside to avoid splitting their votes so much that Republicans finish in the top two and advance to November. Other Democrats will have to adjust their messaging to counter a new threat.\n\n“Mahan upsets the race,” said David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University. “He gets attacked by each side, and he also at the same time puts pressure on the single-digit candidates to get out.”\n\nAs Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom terms out after eight years in office, the Democrats vying to succeed him in a state their party has fully controlled have struggled to catch fire in polling.\n\nRepublicans see an opening to return to relevance with the state plagued by high housing costs, homelessness, skyrocketing energy rates and a growing budget deficit, but face headwinds from President Donald Trump’s unpopularity with most California voters.\n\nWith upward of 30% of voters still undecided, according to recent independent polling, the race to the June 2 primary, where the top two candidates will move on, is still anybody’s game, putting a large chunk of voters in play for candidates regardless of party.\n\nOther contending Democrats include former Rep. Katie Porter, Rep. Eric Swalwell, former health secretary and Attorney General Xavier Becerra, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, investor and environmental advocate Tom Steyer, state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, former state Controller Betty Yee and former Assemblyman Ian Calderon.\n\nWith the California Democratic Party’s annual convention being held in San Francisco later this month, McCuan expects some “hard conversations” about what’s best for the party.\n\nMahan entering the fray raises concerns among Democrats that their vote will be further divided, giving former Fox News host Steve Hilton and Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco — both Republicans — a better chance of reaching the general election.\n\nBusinessman Stephen Cloobeck was the last Democrat to drop out of the race in November when he bowed out to make way for Swalwell. Now, with five months to go and Mahan adding to the field, McCuan expects the number of candidates to shrink again.\n\n“There needs to be a plan for consolidation,” McCuan said. “Everyone’s for competition until it starts to hurt the party.”\n\nMcCuan said based on polling, candidates like Thurmond and Yee with support in the low single digits may be nearing the end of their viability.\n\nIt’s too early to tell which Democrats Mahan’s announcement will have the greatest impact on. Because of the large field and the number of undecided voters, several political observers said that support for many candidates is still pretty soft, making voters’ decision especially malleable.\n\nBill Whalen, a former GOP strategist, said that he doesn’t see Mahan, a moderate who comes from the tech-sector, being able to pick off votes from either of the Republican candidates.\n\n“I know that’s been the thinking of the open primary all along, that voters will make these calculated Machiavellian choices: ‘Well I’ll vote for a Democrat I could live with over a Republican who doesn’t have a chance in November,'” Whalen said. “But it doesn’t seem to work out that way.”\n\nHilton, who met with Mahan in San Jose last month for a tour of one of the city’s interim housing communities, assailed the mayor’s decision to run in a social media post, criticizing him for being in favor of “Democrats’ climate change insanity.”\n\nThe two were previously in agreement over Mahan’s strategy to invest in building shelters over permanent support housing to address the homeless crisis.\n\nWhalen said that Mahan’s entrance in the race could also cause Steyer, who ran for president in 2020, to “rethink his spending.”\n\nSteyer and Mahan are “in the same lane,” according to Whalen, pitting the mayor against a well-funded rival.\n\nThey’ve both been critical of the Sacramento establishment and have cast themselves as “not part of the status quo.” Some of Steyer’s ads have also focused on getting “back to basics,” which has been Mahan’s key policy platform in San Jose.\n\n“Is Steyer going to spend money trying to take Matt Mahan or not, or is he going to spend his money building himself up, or does he have so much money that he can do both at the same time?” Whalen said.\n\nSteyer’s team quickly jumped to make a statement on Mahan’s candidacy last week that appeared to take aim at Mahan’s opposition of a proposed wealth tax on the state’s billionaires that many in the technology world oppose. Steyer, a billionaire himself, has said the state’s wealthiest residents and cooperations should pay more in taxes.\n\n“The race for California’s future is coming into focus: Californians will choose between a government captured by wealthy interests and corporations raking in record profits, or one that stands with working people and demands fairness and shared responsibility,” spokesperson Kevin Liao said in the statement. “Tom Steyer will continue to make the case that billionaires and wealthy corporations should pay their fair share.”\n\nSteyer has enough wealth to stay in the game. And Villaraigosa — who like Mahan has mayoral experience and similar practical, problem-solving messaging, has signaled he won’t leave.\n\nTerry Christensen, a San Jose State University professor emeritus of political science, considers much of the field to be “staunch Democrats” compared to the moderate Mahan who has had a propensity to “tread a fairly fine line” when it comes to President Donald Trump.\n\nThough Mahan faces challenges with not having wide recognition outside of the Bay Area, Christensen said that the mayor will likely be able to find support from independents if he’s able to raise enough money to reach them — a lane to Sacramento.\n\nWhile independent or “no party preference” voter registration has declined in recent years, it still sits at about 22%, according to the Public Policy Institution of California.\n\n“He’s more moderate on issues and more outcomes-oriented,” he said. “He’s going to sound like he’s very practical rather than ideological and that he’s going to get stuff done for California and not just fight Trump. I think that will appeal to a significant number of people.”\n\nBut the “layer in the uncertainty and unease” that Trump has cast over California has changed voters’ appetite compared to 2018 — when Newsom was first elected — according to Robb Korinke, a Southern California-based political consultant.\n\nWhile affordability was a winning message for Democrats nationwide in 2025, recent “federal overreach” — particularly around sending federal agents into cities to conduct immigration enforcement — has begun to overshadow kitchen-table issues in polling, Korinke said.\n\n“I don’t think with a straight face you can go to Democratic voters and say I’m worried about your PG&E bill and housing cost and all of these things and not be strong on (Trump) as well,” he said.","summary":"Mahan is the ninth Democrat to jump into the wide-open race.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2026/02/01/why-matt-mahans-late-entry-reshapes-californias-governors-race/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SJM-L-SJGOVTOUR-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 13:00:58","author":"Grace Hase","authors":["Grace Hase"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.074},{"id":398274044,"title":"An American Citizen Has Been Stuck in El Salvador’s Prison System Since the Biden Administration","text":"When the cops arrived at a party in Cantón la Estancia, a tiny hamlet in the shadow of the San Miguel volcano, Walter Josué Huete Alvarado didn’t think he had any reason to worry. He had a minor infraction on his criminal record — a DUI when he was a teenager — but that shouldn’t matter in El Salvador. It happened in the United States, where he is a citizen. Yet Alvarado’s U.S. passport didn’t deter Salvadoran police from dragging him away, pointing to the tattoos on his hands and claiming he was a member of MS-13.\n\nIt was May 2023, the third year of Joe Biden’s presidency. Alvarado, his relatives and legal counsel told The Intercept, is still incarcerated in El Salvador.\n\nTwo years before the second Trump administration targeted Kilmar Ábrego García over his tattoos and sent him to a notorious Salvadoran prison, the Biden State Department was made aware of Alvarado’s detention — and, for reasons of diplomacy and optics, did nothing. Today, the world has seen the viral images of men lined up at El Salvador’s Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT — heads shaved, crammed front-to-back and forced to straddle each other — as a result of Donald Trump’s brutal deportation regime. But according to lawyer Jorge Palacios, the total number of U.S. citizens and residents detained in El Salvador’s less prominent prisons and jails is unknown.\n\nPalacios, who brought Alvarado’s case before the United Nations, said that members of his group, Socorro Jurídico Humanitario, “have had people come to them saying their detained relatives are U.S. citizens who were visiting,” as was the case with Alvarado. Families often lose touch with their loved ones after their arrests, so “exact details are limited.”\n\nIn Alvarado’s case, a Salvadoran police report, testimony from two of his closest relatives, and insight from legal experts offer a relatively clear picture of what happened. At the police station in Moncagua, officers disregarded his American citizenship and stomped on his passport, telling him it was worthless. Alvarado had a tattoo of the letters “L.A.” — the city of his birth — but officers insisted it represented the city where MS-13 was formed. A “W” — his first initial — was actually an inverted “M,” they said, and a dollar sign was an obscured “S.”\n\nThe police report says Alvarado’s tattoos were “ambiguous, and there is no documentary or evidentiary support indicating that Mr. Huete Alvarado belongs to any gang, organization, or structure involved in the commission of criminal acts.” It was determined that “the police procedure may have been dysfunctional due to the lack of certainty regarding the individual’s belonging to or links with gangs.” \n\nAlvarado has been shuffled between a handful of prisons and penal institutions in the nearly three years since then, never receiving a trial. His situation is in many ways exceptional, given his nationality, but it reflects the broader crisis facing countless families in El Salvador struggling to understand their loved ones’ perpetual, often inexplicable detentions. As similar models of criminalization are being rolled out across Latin America, Alvarado’s case may offer a preview of things to come. \n\nWhen Alvarado was detained, the country of his birth was led by a Biden presidency that had, from the beginning, pitched its commitment to “upholding universal rights” as the “grounding wire of our global policy, our global power.” But since the Biden administration neglected to intervene in Alvarado’s detention, the authority with the best shot at saving him now is the second Trump administration, ideologically aligned with El Salvador’s reactionary leadership and its sweeping gang crackdown. Now, the Salvadoran regime that has effectively disappeared thousands into an opaque network of prisons without trials is more emboldened than ever. \n\nAlvarado’s family was initially supportive of Nayib Bukele, the bearded, grinning, bitcoin-boosting millennial and self-described dictator who rose to power the first time Trump was in office and has held onto it, despite a Salvadoran constitutional prohibition, into a second consecutive term. Murder was declining when Bukele became president in 2019, but many Salvadorans still felt trapped by widespread gang violence and drug trafficking. Bukele, like his predecessors, at first brokered a clandestine truce with gang leaders — providing “financial incentive” to artificially reduce the number of homicides. \n\nThe pact fell apart in early 2022, and murders hit a 30-year high in a single day. Bukele enacted his “state of exception,” which allowed his government to suspend constitutional rights for 30 days, paving the way for an unfettered war on organized crime. Bukele and his governing Nuevas Ideas party have renewed the suspension 39 times. \n\nEl Salvador now has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Bukele’s government has arrested more than 90,000 Salvadorans, close to 2 percent of the population, including thousands of minors. Human rights experts and lawyers estimate that as many as half of everyone detained under the state of exception have no known gang connections. Prisons are overflowing, with the cumulative system operating at over 300 percent capacity.\n\nBy some standards, El Salvador is now considered one of the safest countries in Latin America. Bukele touts record lows in homicide and last year claimed 861 consecutive days without a murder — though, as the Washington Office on Latin America noted, the tally did not include the more than 427 people who have died in custody since the state of exception was decreed. Voters, in turn, have expressed overwhelming support: Bukele had an 85 percent approval rating as of June 2025. \n\nOthers, like Alvarado’s family — with members in both El Salvador and the U.S. — soured on the regime once their relatives disappeared under the state of exception.\n\nThe Biden administration soured on Bukele, too. Initial optimism that the young right-wing leader would bring much-needed reform soon turned to criticism of El Salvador’s “democratic backsliding.” In May 2021, then-Vice President Kamala Harris denounced Bukele’s illegal removal of the country’s attorney general and the dismissal of five of its Supreme Court judges who had tried to stop him from overriding the constitution. The State Department sanctioned several members of Bukele’s inner circle for bribery and undermining democratic processes, and the Treasury Department sanctioned two more for their role in the secret gang truce. \n\nBukele came into conflict with the interim U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, Jean Manes, claiming on social media that Manes had tried to pressure him into freeing a politician charged with corruption. In November 2021, Manes temporarily suspended diplomatic relations with El Salvador.\n\nYet Alvarado’s case didn’t get the treatment of a high-profile American detained by an authoritarian pariah state, like Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, imprisoned in Russia just two months before Alvarado traveled to El Salvador. By May 2023, the Biden State Department had decided that Bukele’s mercurial nature and tendency to lash out warranted a softer touch. No longer would they scold out in the open. Instead, according to a former State Department official familiar with the matter, the National Security Council emphasized back-channeling over public condemnation.\n\nState Department apparatchiks hoped that smoothing relations with Bukele would help them maintain El Salvador’s cooperation on immigration enforcement and counternarcotics, an official who worked under the Biden administration explained to The Intercept, and that an impending loan from the International Monetary Fund would trigger more transparency. The Bukele administration maintained that the state of exception would at some vague point be wound down, and Manes’s replacement, William H. Duncan, insisted on handling any concerns about the country’s punitive turn behind closed doors. \n\nDuncan, per two former State Department employees who asked not to be named for fear of professional consequences, “was very difficult to work with.” He insisted on being the only point of contact to Bukele. Efforts by members of the State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor and Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, or WHA, to bring attention to Alvarado’s case proved ineffective. Duncan’s embassy was aware of the case, but he wasn’t enthusiastic about efforts to push for more visits from embassy legal counselors for Alvarado. Duncan shut down anyone who tried to push for any other lateral communication, “especially any criticism,” one of the State Department sources said.\n\nThese tactics would culminate in an almost subservient brand of appeasement. In June 2024, after Bukele had successfully run for a consecutive (and constitutionally prohibited) term as president, a robust delegation of Biden officials led by Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas — and flanked by Duncan and the WHA’s Assistant Secretary Brian Nichols — attended the Salvadoran strongman’s second inauguration. (Duncan and Nichols did not respond to The Intercept’s requests for comment.)\n\n“During the visit, Secretary Mayorkas met with President Bukele to discuss the many cultural, and economic ties our two countries share and reaffirmed the mutual commitment to address our common challenges,” a DHS press briefing reads. \n\nAlvarado had spent just over a year behind bars.\n\nAlvarado’s absence has been especially difficult for his daughters. His stepdaughter “feels guilty,” said a relative, who requested anonymity for fear of targeting by the U.S. government. “At first it was really, really hard, because she was like, ‘I feel like it’s my fault.’” After getting support at school, she showed signs of improvement, the relative said, but “when she turned 15, she was like, ‘I don’t want to have anything, because Walter’s not here.’” \n\nHis youngest daughter was just 2 when her father was arrested. She has started asking if Alvarado has passed away. \n\nBukele’s army of internet trolls has mocked the family, expressing loyalty to a president they see as an effective leader against gang violence. When they posted about Alvarado’s detention, the family told The Intercept, they would be greeted by accusations that he was, in fact, a gangster who deserved to be punished.\n\nThe Salvadoran president’s popularity can be explained, in part, by previous administrations’ inability to reckon with the country’s post-war contradictions. El Salvador’s reconciliation process in the early 1990s, overseen by the United States and the ultra-conservative Alianza Republicana Nacionalista, or ARENA, party, paved the way for the selling of the country’s telecommunications, banking, and energy infrastructure off to the highest bidder and exported the country’s natural commodities through the use of cheap labor. \n\nThe austerity regime made prime breeding ground for an intricate network of organized crime in the country. The U.S. expelled Salvadoran refugees who had gotten caught up in Los Angeles drug trafficking scene, allowing La Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, to blossom in El Salvador’s urban centers. Successive governments implemented tough-on-crime policies dubbed mano dura, Spanish for “iron fist,” to no avail, and populist, left-wing politicians found it difficult to unravel this Gordian knot through redistributive politics alone. \n\n“It’s perfectly understandable that people support Bukele because he resolved an issue that was really hurting people,” Vicki Gass, the executive director of the Latin America Working Group, told The Intercept. “You’re not making a lot of money. You get remittances from your dad living in the United States. It gets extorted. A friend of mine had his whole workshop and tools stolen. You know, his livelihood, right? It was tough, but replacing gang violence with state violence is not the answer.”\n\nBoosting the image of state violence has become a useful propaganda tool of the Bukele government. The strategy is most clearly captured by CECOT, the state-of-the-art supermax prison where Ábrego García was sent last year. But it is only one of 24 prisons in the country.\n\nAlvarado was first sent to the Centro Penal de Izalco, an older prison where detainees are fed a spartan diet and beating and medical neglect are common. These carceral facilities, where a majority of the individuals caught up in the state of exception have been sent, have been the site of hundreds of deaths from violence and lack of medical care. In 2024, Socorro Jurídico Humanitario reported that of the 235 deaths they had recorded in prisons like Izalco, 94 percent of those who died were not affiliated with any gangs. \n\nAccording to the director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch, “torture, ill-treatment, incommunicado detention, severe violations of due process and inhumane conditions” were rampant in Izalco. \n\nAlvarado smuggled messages to his family through the U.S. embassy in El Salvador, saying he cried every night and that he could not stomach the food. He told his infant daughter to behave herself, and mentioned he was forced to sleep on the concrete floor in only his boxers. His family would send him food to supplement his nutrition, but he would report often not receiving the goods — reflecting a common practice in Salvadoran prisons, according to the Salvadoran human rights group Cristosal, which found that goods sent to the country’s detention centers are often diverted by prison staff.\n\nAfter the Biden era cool-off period, Democrats are again incensed by “the world’s coolest dictator.” Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen made a personal trip to El Salvador to lay eyes on Ábrego García, who was a Maryland resident, and the party has lambasted the cruelty of so-called “third-country” deportations under Trump. Some have been pursuing their efforts since Biden was in power: In November 2023, a group of Democratic congress members petitioned the State Department to determine how many Americans had been detained under El Salvador’s state of exception. It remains unclear if they received a response.\n\nBukele, meanwhile, again renewed the decree in August that allows his government to detain those captured under the state of exception without trial. The tentative date for those hearings was pushed back to 2027. \n\nJust four months into his incarceration, Alvarado became so ill that he was transferred to the Granja Penitenciaria de Rehabilitación de Zacatecoluca, a lower security facility just a 15-minute drive from CECOT. Since then, he’s been moved multiple times, most recently to the Centro Industrial de Cumplimiento de Penas y Rehabilitación, where the state holds many political and foreign prisoners. Primarily, the facility is a work camp for detainees who are considered free of any gang associations.","url":"https://theintercept.com/2026/02/01/american-citizen-el-salvador-cecot-prison/","image":"https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Walter-Josue-Huete-Alvarado.jpg?fit=2000%2C1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 11:00:00","author":"Caleb Brennan","authors":["Caleb Brennan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.329},{"id":398276558,"title":"Gavin Newsom Is Playing the Long Game","text":"“I think we all know why we’re here,” he said, taking the microphone. It was a few days before a statewide special election, and Newsom was speaking to a local chapter of the United Domestic Workers, whose members, largely women of color, had assembled for a rally with the Governor. “Trump knows he’s going to lose the midterms,” he said.\n“He knows that, this time next year, there’s not going to be a Speaker Johnson, that there’s going to be a Speaker Hakeem Jeffries. He knows that his Presidency, as we know it”—he slowed his speech portentously—“is going to come to an end.”\nNewsom had spent weeks campaigning for a statewide ballot measure, called Proposition 50, that would redistrict California and create five likely Democratic seats. In the early days of his career, he studied the speechmaking of Bobby Kennedy and Bill Clinton. Behind a lectern, his gestures still have a rehearsed feel. When he takes the microphone and roams, however, he moves like a boxer, holding his forearms up and parallel, wrists toward each other, right hand crossing to left shoulder, as if blocking. His knees bounce as he comes to a rhetorical peak.\n“He’s trying to rig the election before even one vote is cast,” he said of the President’s gerrymandering efforts. “What did he say to the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott? He said, ‘I’m quote-unquote entitled’—entitled—‘to five seats.’ Now, never in the history of this country has the President of the United States used those words.”\nProposition 50, which aimed to offset Texas’s gerrymandered Republican advantage until 2030, was, for Newsom, the end of a startlingly eventful year. On January 7, 2025, three and a half hours after the ignition of the Palisades Fire, he stood on an adjoining street, amid a flurry of embers, and coördinated what became one of the largest fire responses in state history. Five months later, after protests against ICE raids broke out in L.A. and President Trump federalized more than four thousand members of the California National Guard without the approval of the Governor, Newsom filed a lawsuit—one of fifty-four that the state of California has brought against the second Trump Administration. In mid-August, the Governor’s official X account began mocking the President in his own addled, grandiose, all-caps style. (“DONALD ‘TACO’ TRUMP, AS MANY CALL HIM, ‘MISSED’ THE DEADLINE!!!”) Newsom announced the California redistricting campaign later that month; his favorability ratings jumped ten percentage points in the second half of the year.\nThe events gave him a national profile unusual for a sitting governor. A weighted average of polls asking whom people would vote for now among Democratic Presidential possibilities—a calculation that, at this stage, usually tracks name recognition—has Newsom neck and neck with former Vice-President Kamala Harris. “It’s pulse or no pulse, spine or no spine,” Manny Yekutiel, a civic leader and candidate for city supervisor in Newsom’s home town of San Francisco, told me. “He’s reminding people that the Democrats have a perspective. They can play the game. We can do bombastic tweets!”\nIn the San Diego union hall, Newsom spun around and said, “Donald Trump’s at Mar-a-Lago this week. No one wants to campaign with him!” He let a cheer rise, and added (he once went through a Tony Robbins phase), “The future is inside of us, not in front of us.” In his memoir, “Young Man in a Hurry,” to be published later this month, he seeks to align his own story of becoming—from a hopeful, troubled childhood to the eve of his inauguration as the leader of “the most daring, magical, cursed, blessed state”—with the needs of a nation still finding its way.\nFor years, Newsom has cultivated the air of an accidental politician. He notes that, in his twenties, he was a wine entrepreneur: with support from the dynastic businessman and composer Gordon Getty, he launched a wine shop, then a café, and then a vineyard and other projects, called PlumpJack (a Falstaff epithet, in “Henry IV, Part 1”). Today, he owns, partly in a blind trust designed to avoid conflicts of interest, stakes in offshoot enterprises with names like the Falstaff Management Group, Inc. He tells people that, if his political career ended tomorrow, he would return to life in business, and what a mercy that would be. But the feint convinces almost no one, because Newsom is perhaps the least Falstaffian man in wine. He starts texting at seven in the morning. He dresses each day as if for the meeting that will change his life. His holdings earn him, passively, more than a million dollars a year, enough to live on and more, and yet there he is, week after week, taking notes in policy binders, standing in the sun along the border—a guy so all in for the public grind, it seems, that he has turned even the simple pleasures in life, like poking fun at the President’s unhinged posts, into a statehouse chore.\nIn 1996, when Newsom first entered public office, at the age of twenty-eight, there was a feeling that he would flourish without ascending to the top—too slick, too swank, too smug, too hard for regular people to connect with. (As one of his opponents at the time put it to me, “He was misguided and élite.”) Three decades later, that criticism is unchanged, but his prospects have transformed. Newsom, now fifty-eight, has never lost an election. He has spent more than twenty consecutive years in executive office, and is finishing his second term as the leader of the most populous and powerful state in the Union. His approval ratings drift like summer clouds above fifty per cent, and his congressional-redistricting campaign is central to the Democrats’ play for power this fall. During what was expected to be his lame-duck year, the Governor is accelerating, leaving observers with a newly urgent version of a lasting question: What, exactly, is Gavin Newsom in it for?\nThe audience applauded pluralism; Newsom pressed on. “We dominate in every critical industry,” he said. “Yes, we’re the fourth-largest economy in the world, $4.1 trillion a year, but we dominate with more engineers, more scientists, more Nobel laureates, more venture capital, the finest system of public higher education in the world.” He spread his arms, as if clearing a tabletop. “We have no peers.”\nFor most of the twentieth century, California was a purple state; it voted red in fourteen out of twenty-five Presidential elections. But it has been a blue stronghold for fifteen years, and that period has coincided with both increases in its economic fortunes and an intensification of conservative attacks. Since the pandemic, it has been fashionable for Republicans to stand on San Francisco street corners and point to homeless people, spinning out a story of apocalyptic decay that, they say, results from Democratic leadership. Newsom argues the inverse. Since his first year as governor, he has promoted an idea of California as a terrarium for Democratic principle—enshrining reproductive rights in the state constitution, upholding sanctuary-state policies, pushing for police reform—while emphasizing its successes over its failures. California, the closest thing to a test zone for the blue economy, is home to roughly half of all American unicorn startups, which are valued at more than a billion dollars each, and technologists who made a show of fleeing because of taxes and regulations, like Elon Musk, have returned to found A.I. firms. “The Republicans’ governing thesis cannot be true if California succeeds,” Jason Elliott, a former deputy chief of staff in Newsom’s office, told me. “We disprove their ideas that pluralism is a recipe for failure, that completely deregulated capital is the only way to grow.” He added, “It drives them fucking crazy.”\nThe California governorship is not usually a role of international leadership, but Newsom has given it the appearance of one. Three months after his inauguration, in 2019, he travelled to El Salvador and met with the country’s President and President-elect. In 2023, after the October 7th attacks, he flew to Israel to meet with Benjamin Netanyahu, of whom he later pronounced himself “not a big fan.” (Newsom has asserted Israel’s right to self-defense while condemning the civilian casualties in Gaza, to which California sent more than a hundred pallets of medical supplies.) He joined Xi Jinping in China to discuss climate reform and human rights.\n“He understands that California is one of the leading places for the U.S. to try to compete with China,” Reid Hoffman, a founder of LinkedIn, told me. In 2023, a low ebb in Newsom’s approval ratings, a pundit suggested that Californians felt “left out” of all this travel. But Newsom’s shadow diplomacy, widely seen as a pretentious distraction during the Biden years, has a different look at a moment of nativism and trade conflict in Washington. At the World Economic Forum conference, in Davos, last month, the Governor was denied entry to the U.S. pavilion, where he was scheduled to speak; his team blamed the White House, which claimed to know nothing.\nIn some cases, Newsom’s position on issues has changed as he has taken on a broader view. In 2016, as lieutenant governor, he advocated for shutting down the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant, in central California, to facilitate a clean-energy transition. As governor, he pushed to keep it open, with the paradoxical rationale that clean energy was too important to risk relying on prematurely: a failure in the grid could require a return to fossil fuels and undermine the fuller project’s credibility.\nThe Governor, who has not changed his cellphone number since becoming mayor of San Francisco, in 2004, has nine thousand twenty-two personal contacts on his phone, and is in touch with a startling number of them as he tries to widen his view. “It’s like his focus group,” Jim DeBoo, a former gubernatorial chief of staff, told me. “And his media consumption is very right wing—all I watched when I was his chief of staff was Fox and Newsmax.” (These days, Newsom reads the Righting, a morning summary of right-wing blogs.) He catches nascent changes in the political weather. “During early COVID, he kept telling me, ‘Crime—there’s something here,’ ” DeBoo told me. DeBoo studied the latest crime statistics and saw nothing unusual. He brushed off the worry. Then new numbers came out, showing a large pandemic spike in shoplifting and car theft, and concerns about crime exploded into the headlines.\n“I lost a lot of good friends over that—they thought it was betrayal,” Newsom told me one afternoon, in his Sacramento office. But “I thought, Why aren’t we organizing the campuses? This is an interesting guy.” Six feet three, he had curled himself, like Gumby, into an “S” shape, knees sideways, in the corner of a blue-gray sofa. He and his team, he said, “couldn’t figure out how to, quote-unquote, make it fair. We came up with a compromise this last year that only, I think, infuriated everybody—multiple medals.” He laughed unhappily.\nIn public, Newsom speaks often and openly about his errors, fortifying his image as a bumptious, slightly hapless victim of his own enthusiasms. But some think he plays a longer game than he lets on. “He has been very careful not to get himself in a position where negatives become a liability,” Willie Brown, a former mayor of San Francisco, said.\nTake the Charlie Kirk interview. If Newsom were to run for national office in a couple of years, he would be subjected to the right’s usual claims that Californians are latte-sipping vegan leftists. “Democrats were so traumatized by 2024, and I could see a bunch of people saying, ‘We’re just not going to do this California thing again,’ ” the Democratic campaign strategist and political analyst James Carville told me. “Part of his selling will have to be, I can play in the middle of the country—I can play fresh water and I can play salt water.” A candidate who has a record of setting up colloquies with MAGA loyalists and sharing some of their positions might have an easier time. (Newsom’s next two guests on his podcast were Michael Savage and Steve Bannon.)\nOr take Newsom’s rise to the governorship. In the spring of 2009, Newsom, still serving as mayor, was the only major Democrat running. Bill Clinton endorsed him. Then Jerry Brown, the former governor, organized a committee to explore running again. Newsom decided to withdraw and run for lieutenant governor, biding his time in exchange for entrée to Sacramento in Brown’s shadow. Restraint became his path to power. Six years later, when Barbara Boxer announced that she was retiring from the U.S. Senate, Newsom took the extraordinary step of posting on Facebook that he didn’t want the job. “It’s always better to be candid than coy,” he wrote. By taking himself out of the running, though, he left the powerful Senate position—which would keep its winner out of California for half the year—open to other rising stars, such as Kamala Harris.\nProposition 50 can be understood as a similar gambit: a riposte to the White House’s gerrymandering which was grounded in sincerity but doubled as a strategic move. If the initiative passed, it would show both that Newsom could run a long-shot mobilization campaign and that he could draw together a divided party. In a video that the Governor released in the run-up to the election, Democrats from Barack Obama to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Elizabeth Warren voiced their support for the measure.\nOn the Saturday before Election Day, Newsom held a redistricting rally at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar spoke. Jasmine Crockett, a Texas congresswoman who has been a vocal critic of the Trump Administration, came onstage in stiletto cowboy ankle boots to praise the Governor. (“He saw what was happening in Texas, and he said, ‘Not on my watch!’ ”) Harris appeared. Then came Newsom—the culminating act. He tossed white T-shirts reading “TRUMP IS NOT HOT” into the crowd and rhapsodized about the proposition and “how it’s brought these remarkable elected leaders together.”\n“Newsom for President!” someone yelled from the crowd.\nThe Governor tapped his chest—an acknowledgment without acceptance—and went on talking.\nA riser to the left of the stage was filled with twenty influencers, live-streaming to their audiences. “It’s something that we now prioritize in everything we do,” Lindsey Cobia, a senior political adviser, told me of the influencers. Newsom thinks the MAGA movement has mastered a form of ambient, non-stop messaging that the Democrats have not; his focussed work feeding his narratives to influencers, much of it invisible to consumers of mainstream media, may account in part for his name recognition.\n“He spends most of his time talking to those folks and less of his time talking to more of the traditional reporters these days,” Cobia explained. She and other staffers collaborate on writing Newsom’s Trumpy posts, though a few gags, like a running joke about the Governor selling Newsom Kneepads—“for all your groveling to Trump needs”—are Newsom’s own. Last year, Newsom’s personal social-media accounts gained more than five million new followers, and clocked billions of views and impressions. Newsom’s team calculated that the L.A. rally was live-streamed, from the gaggle in the influencer box, to a hundred and fifty million viewers. “And if I go on Jake Tapper this afternoon?” Sean Clegg, one of his political advisers, told me. “I’m fucking talking to eighty thousand people in California.”\nGavin and Hilary’s parents separated when Gavin was three. Their mother, Tessa, eventually moved the kids from the family home, in the Marina District of San Francisco, and bought what Hilary calls “a little gray house,” in the flats of the suburb Corte Madera, across the Golden Gate Bridge. To make money, Tessa at times took on boarders and had as many as three jobs at once. In “Young Man in a Hurry,” Newsom recalls these years as pared to the bone—“We raised ourselves on giant bowls of mac and cheese and thought nothing of it”—if occasionally enlivened by vacations with the Gettys. Some former associates dismiss this description as a strategic reinterpretation of a largely privileged youth. (One described it to me as Newsom’s “I was born a poor Black child” story—a reference to the parodic opening monologue of Steve Martin’s 1979 comedy, “The Jerk.”) Bill Newsom moved to a town a few hours away, near Tahoe, and the children saw him, at most, once a month. Handoffs happened at the Nut Tree, a minor amusement park in the outer-bay town of Vacaville, a place between places. Hilary told me, “When my mom picked us back up, Gavin would just cling to my father’s legs and cry.”\nNewsom was profoundly dyslexic. At first, his parents enrolled him at a French bilingual school and then at École Notre Dame des Victoires, a French Catholic institution that his father had attended. By the third grade, he had worked himself into a panic over his trouble with reading and math. “ I’m faking being sick, because I hate school and I’m stressed, and they’re always having to pick me up early,” he recalled. Newsom switched to a public school in Marin County. He was a scrawny, shy boy with a bowl cut. “He always called himself stupid,” his sister said, and other kids apparently agreed. “The guys kept saying, ‘If you’re looking for your brother, he’s hanging from his underwear on a lamppost.’ ”\nIn middle school, Newsom took steps to reinvent himself as an athlete. “Rocky” had recently come out, and he emulated the main character—running up and down hills, drinking raw eggs, learning to box. His sister remembers falling asleep night after night listening to the sound of him relentlessly practicing basketball: shooting, shooting, shooting, shooting.\nLearning to read was a similar feat. When I asked Newsom about his dyslexia in his office one afternoon, he showed me an overstuffed folder of printed material, his reading from the previous evening. Almost every word of text was underlined. He flipped through a galley proof of his memoir, in which the underlining covered whole pages—the only way, he said, that he could read any book, even his own. He produced another folder filled with lined paper and covered with his handwriting: he copies all the text he underlines onto writing pads.\nNext, he brought out a stack of canary-yellow index cards, thick as a sandwich. It was covered in his scrawl. From the lined pages, he distills the material and copies things a second time onto the cards. “And, from here, it goes in right in there,” he said, gesturing to his head.\nThis process of underlining, copying, and recopying is the backbone of Newsom’s working life. He spends his ninety-minute commute—between Kentfield, in Marin, where he lives with his wife, the documentary filmmaker Jennifer Siebel Newsom, and their four children, and Sacramento, where he usually overnights once or twice a week—making notations in the back seat of the gubernatorial S.U.V. Between meetings and after dinner, the pads and cards come out. What he described as the resulting “hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands” of pieces of paper lived for a while as ballast in the trunk of his car. Today, they occupy an unofficial archive off the Governor’s office, with a filing system of his own conception. If an adviser tells Newsom something that strikes him as odd, he has been known to vanish into his archive, emerge with a folder (“There are, like, tabs and things,” Jason Elliott told me with horror), and extract a note proving that, months ago, the same adviser told him something else.\nBecause of his reading struggles, Newsom rarely gives long written speeches; instead, he memorizes. (He sees the lines of text on a teleprompter screen as a single image, like a Chinese character, which he uses to recall the next line.) Lindsey Cobia told me, “A four-hour podcast where he gets asked about everything from U.F.O.s to his policy on assisted suicide is actually a more comfortable space for him, because of his dyslexia, than reading a ten-minute speech.” Lateefah Simon, a Bay Area congresswoman, who shared consultants with Newsom during the 2020 Democratic National Convention, recalled that they left to help him with speech prep—normally a half-hour task. “ I didn’t see them for, like, three hours,” she said. “He wanted to do it over and over.”\nSimon met Newsom twenty-five years ago, when she was the director of the Young Women’s Freedom Center, an organization representing girls in the juvenile-justice system. She was chanting with a bullhorn outside his office in protest of his approach to welfare. “The electeds never come out to see you,” she said. But Newsom did, and he listened to the protesters’ grievances for an hour. “At the end, he said, ‘My office is always open to all of you.’ ” Simon began watching his press conferences. “I would tell my members, ‘Write his stats down, and let’s check them—because he has no notes!’ ” Newsom’s stats checked out; he can “drill down,” as he put it, on almost any subject at the slightest invitation. He sometimes gives the impression of a man with more stamina for talking than people have for listening.\nOn the campaign trail, Newsom has a mental stack of cue cards that he riffs on the way a jazz pianist might improvise from a chord chart. His movements through the language can be weird. (“The rule of law, not the rule of Don, and I hope it’s dawning on people” is a construction that he has found fit to repeat on air.)\nHilary, who is now the co-president of PlumpJack, sees his displays of esoteric knowledge as compensatory. In the family, she was thought to take after their brilliant, charismatic father. “My mom was incredibly shy, and always told everyone that Gavin was just like her—but she was super critical of herself,” she said. “I think there was this quiet rebellion in him that wanted to say, I’m not like that.” In high school, he began slicking his hair, wearing suits, and carrying a briefcase, inspired by the TV show “Remington Steele.” He was trying to channel the era’s buffed iconography of masculine power, but came off like Alex P. Keaton. “I remember paying him five dollars to go to the Levi’s store in San Rafael with me and get a pair of Shrink-to-Fit jeans, because I’m, like, ‘You’re bad for my luck in high school,’ ” Hilary said. In light of his trajectory from problem child to aloof entrepreneur, Newsom, who is said to be planning a run for higher office, has an opportunity to become America’s first Gen X President.\nToday, Newsom’s political consultants offer his four decades of hair-gel use as proof of a trueness to self. Sean Clegg told me, “The presentation of Newsom is authentically Newsom!” The argument is not entirely persuasive, because a teen-ager who comes to school with a suit and a briefcase is really just wearing what Newsom himself likens to “costumes.” And the Governor still un-slicks himself for those he knows best. Lori Puccinelli Stern, one of his best friends, said that when he’s off the clock “there’s not a hair-gel bottle in sight. His hair is long. I always say, if you put little glasses on him, he’d be an adult version of Harry Potter.”\nNewsom, who at times can seem more like the Tom Cruise of politics, more successful than beloved, has been at pains to make it clear to people that the suave, wealthy glad-hander is a role he imagined himself into, not the way he was born. (“It’s why I wrote a book,” he told me.) Is that a message that will resonate across the political spectrum? “He has branded himself as the guy who will take on all comers, and right now that’s popular branding among Democrats—the only person challenging him on that position is Pritzker,” James Carville said, referring to the governor of Illinois. “The question for Newsom is: Can he walk into a Black church in South Carolina and engage the audience? That’s to be determined.”\n“It’s a hell of a way to start every single day,” he said. “How many books I could have read! Literature! Philosophy! I think about my life, honestly. I could have gone through the Library of Congress. I could have been someone! I could have wisdom!”\nHis communications adviser, a former investigative journalist named Bob Salladay, nodded, playing along. A trace of Newsom’s childhood shyness lingers in his fondness for performing comedic riffs, usually delivered in a key of ironic self-lament, which insulate him from more direct engagement. He was dressed in a white shirt, dusky-blue suit trousers, and a blue tie knotted, with two crisp dimples, into a four-in-hand. The social-media menswear guru Derek Guy, in a post on Newsom and neckties, pronounced him “one of the few politicians left who knows how to wear one.”\n“This guy is not screwing around,” Newsom said gravely, of the President. He tilted his head self-consciously toward the floor and flashed a chatoyant line of a smile. As a young man, he was often described in the media as having movie-star good looks. He certainly wields his face the way a movie star does: with the care and precision with which most people handle power tools. “Everything we asserted would happen has happened,” he said. “We said he was going to send ICE out on Election Day—and that’s what he did in L.A.”\nThe day before, it had been reported that about a hundred ICE and Border Patrol agents had been stationed near Dodger Stadium; Newsom believed that this was meant to intimidate voters. Video circulated online of federal agents detaining an American citizen outside a Home Depot, then driving off in the man’s car with his toddler still strapped in the back seat.\n“I actually was physically shaking,” Newsom said. “And the cries of the people videotaping it, saying, ‘Who the hell are you? What kind of people are you?’ ” He grimaced. “People who don’t like the word ‘dictator,’ they’re not going to hear the next word you say. But they are acts of an authoritarian.”\nThe Governor sank back further in his chair, as if trying to change the mood, and told Salladay that he had been reading Walt Whitman. He alluded to the poem “O Me! O Life!,” in which the speaker decides that the purpose of living is to do one’s part. Then he paused self-consciously. “Walt Whitman—Jesus!” he said. “I’m becoming my father.”\nThat day, the media had set up cameras at the headquarters of the California Democratic Party, not far away. As evening came, Newsom’s staff convened at the governor’s mansion, where he doesn’t live, to wait for returns. Newsom’s office was telling the press that the redistricting proposition would likely pass by ten points, but its internal polling put the lead closer to fifteen or twenty.\nCNN and the Associated Press called the election right after polls closed. The measure ultimately passed by twenty-nine points—“not just a win, an overwhelming win,” Senator Alex Padilla, who previously oversaw elections as California’s secretary of state, told me. The Governor appeared with his wife after Zohran Mamdani, the newly elected mayor of New York, finished his victory speech, clearing the airwaves. Facing a phalanx of cameras, Newsom declared victory and urged other blue states to follow California’s lead.\n“My call tonight, in the spirit of Whitman, who talked about ‘the powerful play goes on’—we all must contribute a verse,” he said. “And so we need the state of Virginia. We need the state of Maryland. We need our friends in New York and Illinois and Colorado.” He swept a severe gaze from camera to camera. “It is all on the line.”\nIn 1995, Willie Brown was elected mayor of San Francisco. He had hundreds of appointments to make, and Newsom had distinguished himself by introducing Brown to his and Getty’s circle after hours. Newsom gently angled for a seat on the Film Commission, but Brown appointed him to the Parking and Traffic Commission without asking whether he wanted the position. “I said, ‘I’m sure he’s smart enough to be willing to do the job,’ ” Brown recalled. In 1997, when a Board of Supervisors seat opened between elections, Brown appointed Newsom to that post, too. “The vacancy occurred at a time when I really wanted to focus on diversity,” Brown told me. “And there was not a straight white male on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.”\nThe city’s eleven-person legislature had been roiled for decades by infighting between its left and center-left factions. Newsom, with his Getty connections and his business suits, put his leftist colleagues immediately on guard. “The first couple of weeks, I thought he was arrogant and sure of himself,” Tom Ammiano, an activist turned board member, told me. Aaron Peskin, another supervisor who leaned left, said that Newsom vacillated all the way to the end, as if awaiting the arrival of new information. “Yes meant no, no meant yes, maybe meant no,” Peskin said. “Everybody was, like, Do not count him as your sixth vote.”\nNewsom explains his fickleness differently. “I have a difficult time with ideologues on both sides of the aisle,” he said. On the board, he grew frustrated by people complaining about systemic problems and then falling in lockstep behind their like-minded colleagues. “There are systemic challenges—I’m mindful of that—but I saw so much of that victim mentality in my early days of politics in San Francisco. I was exhausted by it,” he told me. “Like, why aren’t we doing the things that need to be done to solve for this?”\nPragmatism, in politics, is a practice of working backward from desired outcomes, rather than forward from abstract ideals. Newsom’s first major pragmatic effort was a homelessness measure called Care Not Cash, which replaced much of the county’s cash welfare with mental-health, substance-abuse, and housing services. Street homelessness had been a Rubik’s Cube of a problem in San Francisco for decades. On a self-appointed mission, Newsom travelled to study homelessness programs in New York and Chicago. Back home, he met the director of the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic, which served many unhoused patients. He told Newsom to visit around the first and the fifteenth of the month, when welfare checks were delivered. Overdose cases spiked around those days. “He said, ‘You’re killing people,’ ” Newsom recalled. “It just shifted my mind.”\nCare Not Cash passed as a ballot proposition in 2002, securing Newsom’s political reputation as a young man who could turn the puzzle sideways. Critics saw it as something more cynical: a play to voters’ impulses to punish people on the street, replacing their ability to spend or save with unbankable services and creating supply issues at temporary shelters. Ammiano described the program to me as “a gimmick, and very inhumane”; Newsom received death threats. Jason Elliott characterized Newsom’s approach as an artifact of its era. “Permanent supportive housing is now very well socialized but was not twenty-five years ago,” he said. Homelessness numbers improved in the short term.\nYet homelessness in California—and San Francisco—has not gone away; if anything, it represents a growing American crisis. Newsom likes to point out that California had no statewide homelessness policies when he became governor. He rattled off a list of programs, from special grants for finding housing to conservatorship reform, that he launched during his tenure. On housing, the Governor has been an ally of State Senator Scott Wiener, one of the legislative leaders of the YIMBY (Yes in my back yard) movement, which aims to alleviate housing-supply shortages to improve affordability. “He knows we need to zone for more housing and make it easier to get permits,” Wiener said. “You never guarantee the Governor’s signature, but ten out of ten times he has signed the bills.” (Critics argue that YIMBY policies amount to open season for real-estate developers.) When I asked Newsom whether his thinking on homelessness had changed over the years—given his variety of efforts—he insisted that the same thread was “completely pulled through,” just in ever-improving versions. “It’s this notion of constant iteration, trial and error, throwing more things on the board, seeing what sticks,” he said. “It’s the entrepreneur in me.”\n“He had that I-want-to-be-a-President vibe twenty-five years ago,” Peskin, who recalled entering Newsom’s supervisor office for the first time and coming face to face with a bust of J.F.K., told me. In 2004, Nancy Pelosi told this magazine that she thought about a Newsom Presidency. (Recently, she told me that she had no memory of saying so, then added, “I do know, from the standpoint of leadership, vision, and values, knowledge of the issues, strategic thinking about how to get things done . . . he’s masterful.”) Others are less circumspect. Wiener told me, “He’d probably kill me for saying this, but I think he’s going to run.” Willie Brown said, matter-of-factly, “I think he’s had that in mind from Day One.”\nNewsom, who dutifully records every explanation he hears for the Democrats’ losses in 2024 on a list that now runs to twenty-seven pages, is routinely described as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination—an odd claim about a race in which nobody is yet running. If he were to emerge as the Democrats’ nominee for 2028, he would be the second consecutive San Francisco politician to secure that role, after Harris. In recent years, San Francisco, a seven-by-seven-mile port whose population has never exceeded nine hundred thousand, has produced a Vice-President, a Speaker of the House, and a number of redoubtable legislators, making it perhaps the country’s hottest forge for powerful Democrats. The heat comes partly from the city’s all-pervading tech industry—“the center of the universe right now,” as one lawmaker put it to me—but also from a grassroots culture that perennially wrestles the establishment. San Francisco hasn’t elected a Republican supervisor or mayor for half a century, but its liberal orthodoxies are represented by passionately disparate factions. “Kamala used to say, If you’re running for office in the Bay Area, it’s like a knife fight in a phone booth,” Lateefah Simon, who worked for Harris in the district attorney’s office, said.\nWhen Newsom ascended to the mayorship, in 2004, he was regarded as a bridge between the old San Francisco and a newer, more entrepreneurial one. “He wasn’t an outsider to politics, but he was willing to do things differently,” one of his associates said. At the time, the L.G.B.T.Q. community was a swing vote pulled between a history of leftist outsider politics and the center-left interests of growing professional success. As the gay-marriage debate intensified, Newsom worked with city officials to change the marriage forms, and arranged for a ceremony for a lesbian couple. By the end of that evening, they had married dozens of gay couples; thousands followed.\nThe news of these marriages made headlines as far away as Australia. In the U.S., it made Newsom a pariah in his own party. Many people told me that, when Barack Obama visited San Francisco that year to fund-raise for his U.S. Senate run, he refused to be photographed with Newsom. (The Obama team has denied this account.) Senator John Kerry, who had just lost the 2004 Presidential election to George W. Bush, spoke at a private banquet in town. Peskin, then the president of the Board of Supervisors, recalls walking out after hearing Kerry claim that, were it not for Newsom alienating voters with this policy, he would be President. (A spokesperson for Kerry denied that he made this remark.) When I suggested to Pelosi that issuing marriage licenses to gay couples wasn’t too daring of a move in San Francisco, she pointed to Newsom’s Democratic career. “He had his own future at risk,” she said. “Make no mistake—it took courage.”\nToday, of course, more than two-thirds of Americans support same-sex marriage, proving Newsom’s political intuition correct. But gay marriage also proved what could be called Newsomism: a way of pushing policy out in front. In 2004, in an era defined by Clinton and Bush, common wisdom held that the romance of politics happened at the level of charm, values, and having-a-beer-ability; policy came later, fleshing out the details like a lawyer with a prenup. What gay marriage showed was that political courtship could flow the other way—from a daring policy to the politician behind it. “Gavin made a conscious decision not to visibly be part of the story,” Michael Farrah, a longtime legislative aide to Newsom, said. “But, in the end, it helped his star rise more.”\nLori Puccinelli Stern described the period after Tessa’s death as the only time she had ever seen Newsom despondent. “He didn’t talk for two or three days,” she said. “We were talking to him, but he wouldn’t answer us.”\nThe previous year, Newsom had married Kimberly Guilfoyle, then a staffer in the left-leaning district attorney’s office and more recently a Fox News host and a onetime fiancée of Donald Trump, Jr. (At present, she is the U.S. Ambassador to Greece.) The idea seems to have been for two ambitious people to double their luck together. The reality was closer to a fast-lane collision. When I asked Hilary about the marriage, she said, “Oh, God,” and spent a moment in uncomfortable laughter. During their mother’s illness, she thought, Newsom had “locked” his heart: “It wasn’t, in my opinion, the authentic decision on my brother’s part.” A 2004 Harper’s Bazaar photograph of the couple spooning in evening wear on a rug in Ann Getty’s mansion was widely seen as vulgar and out of touch; two decades later, it remains one of the first things some Californians remember about Newsom. By the time it was published, Guilfoyle was spending a lot of time in New York, where she had taken a job as a host on Court TV. Divorce proceedings followed soon after.\nIn 2007, it became public that Newsom had engaged in an affair with the city’s Commission Appointments Secretary, who was married. She resigned from her position and got retroactive pay for leave, which struck some people as unfair. She and Newsom having had City Hall offices surrounding that of her husband, a top Newsom aide, seemed somehow perverse. Of the revelations, Newsom announced, “Everything you’ve heard and read is true”—a response that, in its unusual comprehensiveness, seemed to take the sport out of further investigation. Nine months later, he was reëlected mayor.\nBy most accounts, Newsom’s relationship with his current wife changed his course. She was the second oldest of five daughters in a Republican family who lived in the affluent Bay Area suburb of Ross and owned a ranch in Montana. Her older sister had died after being struck by a golf cart in which Jennifer, then six years old, had been sitting. In an interview with the L.A. Times in 2023, Siebel Newsom described her childhood efforts “to be perfect, to make my parents forget, by being two daughters instead of one.” The couple’s first date, in 2006, was blind; their second was the Red Tie Gala, for the Little Sisters of the Poor. Puccinelli Stern recalled, “He says to me, ‘Can you guys meet for a drink downtown before?’ And I said to my husband, ‘Peter! There’s someone disguised as Gavin Newsom on the phone actually making a plan!’ ”\nThey were used to having Newsom as their third wheel. (“He showed up on the plane when we were going to our honeymoon,” Puccinelli Stern explained. “I said, ‘What are you doing here?,’ and he goes, ‘You’re not going on vacation without me!’ ”) Months later, on a group trip, Newsom arrived with Siebel, looking as if “he’d seen a ghost,” Puccinelli Stern said. “I walk up and I go, ‘What the hell is the matter with you?’ He goes, ‘It was just awful. It was just us two on a plane for five and a half hours, and I had to talk about my emotions!’ ”\nNewsom had become a heavy drinker. He began making daily visits to the president of the Delancey Street Foundation, a tough-love recovery center geared toward former prisoners and substance users. He stopped drinking for more than a year before going back to it with what is said to be moderation. Hilary credits Siebel, whom Newsom married in 2008, for forcing him to confront the death of their mother. “He had taken the Irish-dad approach: nothing to see here, all good, everybody’s fine, let’s get to work,” she said. “Jen brought him out so that he could express himself.”\nWhen I asked Newsom about this transformation, he said, gnomically, “The mask came off”—perhaps an allusion to the documentary “The Mask You Live In,” from 2015, made by his wife. It examines media ideals of masculinity and their constraining influence on boys and men. Newsom hosted Richard Reeves, the president of the American Institute for Boys and Men, on his podcast last spring. “Young boys and young men are searching for a script or a story of how to be a man today,” Reeves told me. “The choice that they very often face is the traditional ‘This is what real men are,’ from the right, or a deafening silence from the left, which has almost entirely told young men what not to be.”\nIn 2020, fifty-six per cent of men younger than thirty voted for Joe Biden; in 2024, the same percentage voted for Trump. (Newsom, in his gubernatorial elections, has fared well among young voters, and has cut the general male vote down the middle.) MAGA support among young men is strong not only in working-class domains. A much circulated story published in Compact magazine in December posited a “lost generation” of millennial white men in élite fields—media, academia, tech—who privately felt discriminated against. “Most of the men I interviewed started out as liberals,” the story’s author, Jacob Savage, wrote. “Some still are.”\nThe day that Newsom’s episode with Reeves was released, the Governor signed an order directing various state agencies to support men and boys “suffering in silence,” through mental-health programs, career-building opportunities, and recruitment in fields like teaching. Reeves told me, “What he wants to do, I think, is to be able to go to the Republicans and say, ‘You talk a lot about boys and men, but what have you done? I’m doing it.’ But there’s also a style that is appealing to young men which is straightforward, jokey, sometimes a bit risk-taking, just rolling with the punches.” This is the style that Newsom has employed on broadcasts with figures like Kirk and in public quarrels with Joe Rogan. In Reeves’s view, Newsom’s efforts can align the Democratic Party’s future with the fate of America’s supposedly lost young men. For Newsom, however, it would also have a shadow benefit, transfiguring the roughest patch of his history, when he was a lost young man himself, into a political virtue.\nWhat he was less ready for was packaging this bursting portfolio into a political identity. Bob Salladay told me, “We work a lot on simplifying the story.” Long after it was politically convenient, Newsom gushed to me about the Biden Administration’s domestic platform. “What he was able to deliver from a policy perspective was next-level,” he said. But Biden’s messaging was so notoriously poor that most Americans were oblivious to what many consider the fullest program of worker-oriented policies since the New Deal. At their best, Newsom’s policies—same-sex marriage, say, or redistricting—act as beacons and sparky hits. At their worst, they recall Bidenism: a weave of change that’s underfoot before it has had a chance to be admired on the loom. “I used to get so frustrated, because I’d be, like, ‘Hey! We’re going to give away free community college. Can we just do that this year and call it a win?’ ” Jim DeBoo said. Instead, Newsom insisted that free tuition become part of a larger higher-education-reform plan with many interlocking pieces—a program that is hard to explain in fifteen seconds on TV.\nOn February 19, 2020, the Governor delivered a State of the State address about homelessness, pledging new funding for housing, substance-use treatment, mental health, and social services—a major, coördinated attempt to work the Rubik’s Cube on every axis. Then it all went to the wind. On March 4th, a seventy-one-year-old who had recently come off a cruise died of a strange new respiratory virus: California’s first confirmed COVID-19 death. Newsom declared a state of emergency that day.\nMass crises are unforeseen but not unknowable—there is precedent to consult, or at least experts. During the pandemic, leaders found themselves flying in the dark. “The best you could do was ‘Let’s talk to the Ebola czar. Let’s talk to historians who have studied the Spanish flu,’ ” Elliott said. “Shutting down the economy? And closing schools? There was no precedent.”\nNewsom tacked toward caution. On March 19th, he issued the country’s first statewide stay-at-home order. By mid-April, he was outlining a process for economic reopening, which he backtracked on when the state experienced a summer surge. “We had to have tough conversations about what was happening in the community and businesses closing,” Robert Garcia, a congressman who was then the mayor of Long Beach, and who lost both of his parents to the virus, said. Newsom’s vigilance suppressed California’s infection rate during the first wave of cases, letting it avoid the deadly hospital overload of states such as New York, whose death rate in 2020 was twice as high. Yet his personal recklessness brought the first great challenge of his governorship.\nIn November, 2020, a Fox station broadcast photographs of Newsom eating maskless at a twelve-person birthday dinner in Napa Valley, in contravention of his own recommendation that Californians avoid large gatherings. Other guests included medical executives and a lobbyist, which looked bad, and the restaurant was one of California’s most rarefied, the French Laundry, playing into Newsom’s reputation as a rule-bending swell. He apologized, but cooped-up Californians were angry. In April, 2021, a petition to recall the Governor qualified for the ballot.\n“Recalls are existential,” DeBoo told me. “You lose an election, and there can be another election. You lose a recall, you’re basically done.” Newsom assembled a team to defeat the recall. Sean Clegg said, “I told him, You can be Gray Davis”—a governor who was successfully recalled, in 2003, leading to the election of Schwarzenegger—“or you can be Scott Walker.” Walker made his recall a referendum on the other side. Some of the petition’s signatories were Democratic voters, but its loudest advocates were conservative businesspeople who resented the lockdown, and a campaign against the recall, led by the strategist Juan Rodriguez, painted the effort as a bad-faith Republican power grab.\nThe recall failed by twenty-four points. It showed that nearly two-thirds of voting Californians wanted Newsom as governor. It filled his political coffers, bringing in seventy million dollars from donors. And it left him with a powerful mobilization network. (The Governor’s redistricting campaign was run, in ninety days, with the recall staff and playbook. “Part of the reason we were successful is that we had an established model,” Rodriguez told me.) The experience also gave Newsom a new edge. “His skin got a lot thicker,” DeBoo told me. “It was a training round in big-kid politics.”\nTheory 2 says that this is not the moment to break the liberal coalition. The number of people openly or covertly exasperated by MAGA is now enormous, and what’s needed is a dynamic unifier who can get things done. That will entail the coöperation of finance and industry, which, weary of the current Administration’s volatile economic and foreign policy, are likely to support a challenger who can steady the boat. And it will entail the collaboration of young dynamos adept at gathering excitement—a vital skill not to be mistaken for the skill of wrestling ideas into law. Isn’t it better to improve the devil we know? Alliances and institutional memories are the Democrats’ great advantage over a self-uprooting Republican Party. Take the advantage, Theory 2 says.\nNewsom is the Democrats’ current lead contender for a Theory 2 approach—the preferred path of the Party establishment, and, not surprisingly, one around which structures and funding channels have already begun to form.\nIn late October, almost two weeks before the redistricting vote, Scott Wiener announced that he was running for Congress against Nancy Pelosi, whom he lauded in his announcement. Two days after the redistricting vote, Pelosi announced that she would not seek reëlection, turning attention toward younger Democrats. “There’s all this potential energy just held in the plates for the Democrats if it’s not Biden and it’s not Ruth Bader Ginsburg,” a senior adviser to Newsom told me.\nMany members of this rising cohort are longtime Newsomites. Some, like Simon, formed bonds with him before reaching power. Robert Garcia, now the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, which is responsible for investigating the Trump Administration, has been a political ally ever since Newsom, then the lieutenant governor, endorsed his underdog run for Long Beach mayor. Many of them bridge left and center-left constituencies. Ammar Campa-Najjar, a Mexican Palestinian Navy reservist in contact with Newsom since 2011, has unsuccessfully run for Congress twice against the Republican incumbents in his Southern California district but announced last fall that he would try a third time, figuring that redistricting, among other things, had improved his prospects. He told me, “If you had said in 2018 that being a Mexican Palestinian who grew up in Gaza would become an asset in today’s political world, I would have said you were smoking something.”\nNewsom’s ascent to higher office might not necessarily go unchallenged even in California, because some people believe that Kamala Harris is making moves toward another run for President. There was her declaration, in July, that she would not run for California governor—an uncanny echo of Newsom’s own preëmptive refusal of the Senate seat. There is her coyness about her future plans, and her own recent memoir. And there was the conspicuous fact that, at the redistricting rally at the Los Angeles Convention Center in the run-up to Election Day, Harris did not mention Newsom once. Someone who knows both politicians well described their relationship as “careful.” Newsom’s best case would be for her to clear the runway early and deliver an endorsement. “If he can get her to be as smooth on her exit as possible, then there will be nobody else looking for that nomination from California—not a soul,” this person said.\nTo many eyes, Newsom’s talent for compromise-brokering gives him dexterity in a fractious state. Others see a history of impure influence. At the end of Newsom’s mayoral term, in January, 2011, he refused to be sworn in as lieutenant governor for a week, allowing him to appoint a new district attorney in San Francisco. D.A.s can prosecute labor, consumer, and environmental violations and other business infractions. In San Francisco, the seat has often seemed to be guarded by industry. The city’s only left-wing D.A. during the past twenty years, Chesa Boudin, who created an Economic Crimes Against Workers Unit and prosecuted DoorDash, was recalled by way of a campaign whose funders included a major DoorDash investor. Newsom appointed a moderate. Peskin, then the chairman of the city’s Democratic Party, described the message to big business as “You’re in good hands. Now, would you remember I’m going to run for governor in a couple of years and send me some dough?”\nThe question of influence has come to a head with the tech industry. Marc Benioff, the C.E.O. of Salesforce, is a godfather to one of Newsom’s children. Occasionally, the Google co-founder Larry Page crashed in Newsom’s living room during his early days building the company. Newsom, in his first book, “Citizenville” (2013), laid out an idealistic vision of tech entrepreneurship as a tool for better government. When I asked about perceptions of his coziness with tech power, he told me, “It’s fair.”\nEarly on, “it was just Larry and Sergey, Ev and Biz,” he said. In Newsom’s view, many leaders in tech abandoned their own early principles. “These folks have changed. Elon is a perfect example—I knew him well for years. These are not my friends anymore.”\nBut neither are they enemies. After members of S.E.I.U.-U.H.W., a powerful health-care union, started a petition to get a one-time wealth tax on Californians worth more than a billion dollars on this year’s ballot, Newsom began openly working against the effort, saying that the proposal made no fiscal sense: in the long term, the state would collect more revenue from taxing billionaires at regular rates over time, not frightening them away with a single, enormous tax. And nothing has challenged Newsom’s needle-threading more than the explosion of A.I. “There was a really profound question, which was: Who decides the future of this technology? Who decides what it’s going to mean for people?” Teri Olle, the vice-president of Economic Security California, a policy-advocacy group, said. Her interest was largely in the socioeconomics of A.I.—whom it would make rich and powerful, whom it might immiserate.\nThe technology also posed new kinds of risks. Two years ago, after working with Olle and A.I.-safety experts, Scott Wiener introduced a regulatory bill that would require major A.I. powers to hew to predefined safety standards, undergo audits, and allow the state attorney general to hold companies liable. Olle helped rustle up support from Hollywood talent. “You had Mark Ruffalo and a whole slew of A-listers telling the Governor that they really wanted him to sign,” she told me. Most major tech firms hated the bill, catching the Governor between California’s two most prominent industries.\nNewsom vetoed the bill. “People who I really trusted were saying, ‘Hold on,’ ” he said. Instead, he convened a working group to study A.I. safety, led by Jennifer Chayes, who spent twenty years as a head of core computing and A.I. labs at Microsoft; Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, a former California Supreme Court justice, who has worked on A.I. legal questions; and Fei-Fei Li, a founder of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, who is often called the Godmother of A.I. Last March, the group issued a draft of a report, which urged a shift from liability-based guardrails to a trust-but-verify standard of transparency—“the difference between requiring you to lower your carbon emissions and saying, ‘Tell us what your carbon emissions are,’ ” as Nathan Calvin, general counsel at the A.I.-safety organization Encode, who consulted on the bill, told me. The new framework would allow elected leaders to respond to problems through the evolving life of A.I. technology, rather than making them define terms from the start.\n“We were all really pleased,” Olle admitted. Last summer, when Wiener brought forward a second bill, some companies, including OpenAI, still sought alternatives, but others, such as Anthropic, went so far as to formally endorse it, and Newsom signed it. The President has authorized the Justice Department to quash all state efforts to regulate A.I., but New York’s A.I.-safety act, signed in December, explicitly drew from California’s transparency models, and other state laws are expected to follow.\nWhat does Gavin Newsom believe in, beyond his own political future? Proponents of the Governor point to moments like these, when he transformed fraught policy into a bridge to unite diverse interests. The corridor to his office is lined with Paul Fusco’s photographs from Bobby Kennedy’s funeral train, showing a varied, stricken nation assembled along the tracks. Newsom, like the postwar institutional Democrats he lionizes, sees the state as the center of the wheel of American endeavor. For Americans who share his sense of loss, not so much for a past that never was as for a future that was promised, time is running out. The children who were seven at the time of Kennedy’s funeral—a year before the moon landing—will turn sixty-five this year. The students who will enter college in the fall were seven when Trump descended the golden escalator. One can hope that they will hold the thread, but to them the thread is in the realm of ghosts. This is the country they know, and the rest of it is American history.\nIn the run-up to the speech, the state was projected to have an eighteen-billion-dollar deficit. Newsom claimed that it was three billion through different projections, but said that prudence was in order. In the past year, many economists and bankers have warned that the United States is on unstable economic ground, meaning that whoever runs for President in 2028 may do so in the midst of a financial crisis. In his office, Newsom told me that his address was meant to look to that contingency.\n“I was thinking about this notion of ‘democratizing our economy to save democracy’—they’re completely linked,” he said. The economic woes of the average American, he believed, had led to the Democrats’ defeat in 2024. “People will look for anything different in the absence of tangible solutions. That’s why we were willing to give Trump another at-bat.”\nSince becoming governor, Newsom has stationed nearly four hundred members of the National Guard statewide, focussed on the southern border. (“Trump pulled them off the border for L.A., which is the great irony,” Newsom said.) The line he walks on immigration is a fine one. As governor, Newsom has coördinated with ice and the Department of Homeland Security on eleven thousand criminal-deportation transfers from state prisons. “That doesn’t make me popular,” he said. “But you can’t countenance criminal behavior, period—if you’re here without documentation, there’s no special pass for that.” For those not convicted of major crimes, however, California remains a sanctuary state, and Newsom, in his first budget, set aside money for Jewish Family Service and Catholic Charities in San Diego, which provide services to migrants who have crossed the border—an effort that eventually led to the state investing hundreds of millions of dollars in migrant centers. These two prongs, tightening border security and helping those who do arrive, are not mutually exclusive, he maintains; California has not experienced the overwhelm seen in states such as Texas, which has concentrated on policing.\nNewsom said that he had warned the Biden Administration about the political stakes of not controlling the border. “I said, ‘I’m getting it from Democrats everywhere. I go down in San Diego, I go down to Imperial, people are angry. You’re losing your supporters,’ ” Newsom told me. “Whoever is the next President, if they have control of Congress for two years, they should be out of office if they don’t address this issue.” During a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office last February, Newsom said, the President harped on immigration.\n“I said, ‘I’m with you—let’s get rid of sanctuary policy,’ ” Newsom told me. “ ‘Let’s do comprehensive immigration reform. It exists only because of your unwillingness, at the federal level, to actually solve the problem.’ ”\nNo one who meets with Newsom walks away without a list of policy programs that must be handled more effectively. Late last year, he assembled a team to pore over the policy platforms of candidates running for California governor this fall and to see whether there were ideas that he could take up and put into practice before the end of the year. All his political life, he said, people have been telling him to focus; all his political life, he has refused. “We don’t have the luxury of that,” he told me in his office. “Foster care matters, as much as child care matters, as much as prenatal care matters, as much as preschool matters, as much as preventable-disease and chronic-disease management matter, as much as—” He paused for breath. His arms were in the air, and he was almost dancing.\n“Geez!” he exclaimed, as if suddenly overcome by an idea. “I wish I was running for governor again!” ♦","summary":"California’s governor has been touted as the Democrats’ best shot in 2028.

Sign up for our free newsletters here.\n\nThe couple posted up at a central table to be seen — not just by other gun-enthusiast queer folk who would meet them there before heading to a nearby gun range social, but also by passersby. Self-defense training alone won't keep the increasingly targeted queer community safe, they believe. The world also needs to know that they're ready for the fight.\n\nTheir quest for empowered queer visibility is embodied in the Pink Pistols' motto: \"Armed queers don't get bashed.\"\n\nPink Pistols Pittsburgh formed a year ago, becoming one of 50 chapters of the national organization across the United States and Canada. The local chapter's first year coincided with heightened tension around gender and sexual identity. Since summer, Pittsburgh's Public Source spent time with the Pink Pistols as they practiced their sport and built a community now marking its first anniversary.\n\nSIGN UP HERE to get PhillyVoice's free newsletters delivered to your inbox\n\nIn the heat of late August, passing traffic bounced beams of light through the dark corners of the heavy metal gym Death Comes Lifting in Pittsburgh's Allentown neighborhood. Kei, who asked to have their last name withheld for their safety, perused a table of unloaded guns laid out for Pink Pistols Pittsburgh's \"Pistol Practice in the Crypt\" class.\n\nNow training in competitive shooting, Kei's original introduction to gun culture was through more conservative crowds. \"There was a time in my life where this was no issue,\" they said. \"It wasn't until maybe two years ago that I started to begin transitioning that things became a little bit more complicated.\" Kei wanted to learn more, but felt less comfortable in the traditional firearms spaces they'd come to know. An encounter in which they were harassed and followed in Market Square pushed them to expand their self-defense skills.\n\n\"That is a terrifying feeling, knowing that you're prey,\" Kei said. They spent nights scrolling through Reddit, looking for a local option that could bridge their two worlds, before finding and connecting with Pink Pistols Pittsburgh. \"I'm less scared now. I certainly feel more encouraged to go outside,\" Kei said, smiling through dark red lipstick, curtain bangs framing their face. \"Not because I'm looking to start a fight, more because I feel like I have the training and tools now to give me an edge in preventing the fight in the first place, and if necessary, winning the fight.\"\n\nThe national number of reported hate crimes doubled between 2015 and 2024, even as the overall rate of violent crimes dropped across the U.S. The rising number of hate crimes butts up against a surge in anti-transgender legislation from federal and state governments, with 2024 standing as the fifth consecutive record-breaking year for the total number of anti-trans bills considered in a calendar year, according to Trans Legislation Tracker.\n\n\"I completely disagree that stricter gun control is the solution for keeping people safer right now,\" said Lex, who asked to be identified only by first name because of potential personal ramifications. \"I think it would be really detrimental for us to give up our firearms in a time where we are potentially at risk of losing other constitutional rights. I think the 2A [Second Amendment] exists to protect all of the other amendments in the Constitution.\"\n\nFrom Black Friday to targets in the basement\n\n\"If enough LGBT people start carrying and being loud and visible about it, that will make bigots and extremists and people who might be motivated to commit a hate crime think twice before they try to attack an LGBT person, essentially changing the narrative and changing the perception of LGBT people that we are weak … that we are snowflakes,\" said Lex from the couple's basement-turned-dry-firing range, where they practice target shooting and honing their reflexes without ammo. The floor around their washer and dryer is layered with cardboard to prevent dings from Russian reload drills. Magazines crashed to the floor as Kevin clicked a new one in his Kalashnikov rifle, pointed at the taped-up target of a faceless figure, tensed and dry fired again.\n\nKevin and Lex, who both identify as queer, got married in September 2024 after meeting three years prior at a music festival. Curious about self-defense and gun culture, they had flirted with gun ownership and signed up for a few classes, \"but never made it a priority,\" said Lex. Then, about two months after their wedding, Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris in the general election. \"And so when it was Black Friday, it was time to take advantage of the sales,\" said Kevin. He headed out to purchase his first handgun.\n\nBelow a strand of rainbow flags in their living room, the couple watched as Trump's first moves in office included pardoning violent insurrectionists from the Jan. 6, 2021 attacks on the Capitol. \"We realized that we couldn't necessarily rely on the government to enforce laws to protect our safety when the government itself is pardoning folks who commit violent crimes, even against law enforcement officers,\" said Lex. \"So we felt really strongly that there was a present need for us to create a community of LGBT gun owners out here in our area, out in Western PA.\"\n\nKevin and Lex got connected to a firearms instructor through a friend in the queer community. He taught the couple gun safety protocols and connected them to a sportsman's club's outdoor shooting range. Kevin began his training as an Intro to Pistol instructor through the National Rifle Association (NRA); became a range safety officer; and he and Lex got Stop the Bleed certified, a national program that teaches bystanders how to control severe bleeding in an injured person.\n\nThe couple started the Pittsburgh chapter of Pink Pistols, a nonpartisan network dedicated to the legal, safe and responsible use of firearms for self-defense centering the LGBTQIA+ community, but welcoming of anyone aligned with the cause.\n\nPro-gay, pro-gun and nonpartisan\n\nThe movement is gaining new members alongside expanding interest in gun ownership from minority groups. The national organization saw bumps in membership after the Orlando gay nightclub shooting and Trump's second election, growing into the largest LGBTQ gun rights group in the country after merging in 2025 with LGBTQ firearm education program Operation Blazing Sword. The national Pink Pistols has 9,400 members on its private Facebook page.\n\n\"It's not so much that we created Pink Pistols and then suddenly a bunch of LGBT people decided they wanted to become firearms owners,\" said Lex. \"There was a bunch of LGBT people who didn't really have a space to practice firearm skills where they felt accepted and where they felt they could be fully themselves. And so when we just opened up a Pink Pistols chapter in this area, a ton of LGBT people who had already been looking for something like this came to us.\"\n\nThe Pink Pistols handbook insists that the group's politics start and end with pro-gay, pro-gun causes. \"We want to maintain a big tent,\" said Lex.\n\n\"I think when you hear 'LGBT community' and then you hear 'firearms training,' a lot of people instinctively think these are leftists, these are liberals. Words like socialist might even get thrown around. But that's not part of our mission at all,\" said Lex. \"It doesn't matter whether you're a liberal, conservative or something else. If you're an American citizen, you have a right to keep and bear arms.\"\n\nA video of Lex carefully firing off a handgun at the range with a punk cut of blonde curls and flowered leggings stands in contrast to the camo-clad, bearded influencer that still stereotypically dominates the diversifying 2A space. The Pink Pistols Pittsburgh social feed promotes the chapter's gun range community days, first aid and responsible firearms trainings, alongside Kevin's reviews for starter guns and \"Queer 2A Tea.\" But even as demand for the Pink Pistols' social media content bridges generations of allies and queer people across the political spectrum, Lex has taken down a lot of the face-forward reels she once posted to social media under the Pink Pistols Pittsburgh handle after a year of increasing political scrutiny of the LGBTQ community.\n\nFighting conspiracy theories with community\n\nFederal officials said the August 2025 Annunciation Catholic Church and School shooting was carried out by a transgender woman, though the shooter's gender identity wasn't entirely clear. Days later, Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was fatally shot while addressing a question on mass shootings and transgender people at an event at Utah Valley University. As both political parties jostled to associate the act with the other camp, investigators reported Kirk's alleged shooter was involved in a romantic relationship with his transgender roommate. The back-to-back events fueled conspiracy theories among the right wing, including by members of the Trump administration, that trans people are predisposed to commit violence. In two press releases, Pink Pistols condemned the shootings, denounced \"any such actions that are attributed to the LGBTQ community as a whole,\" and reaffirmed the organization's \"purely defensive mission.\"\n\nPro-LGBTQ organizations like GLAAD and fact checkers responded in kind, citing statistics that despite being less than 2% of the U.S. adult population, transgender people are four times as likely to be victims of crime, and were confirmed as responsible for just 0.1% of the 5,748 mass shootings in the U.S. since 2013. When the Justice Department followed the Catholic school shooting with a potential plan that would restrict transgender people from owning guns, the queer gun rights community got a boost from the NRA.\n\nKevin and Lex's Pink Pistols Pittsburgh inbox lit up with people who were increasingly anxious in the swirl of escalating rhetoric, some afraid to leave their homes. People requested access to firearms training and private lessons, and the organization's next group class sold out. \"I had people that came that said they never thought about owning weapons before,\" said Kevin. The chapter got another jump in interest after January's violent ICE raids in Minneapolis, filling up classes months in advance as Kevin put out a video listing additional resources to attempt to meet demand for training. \"You know it's getting bad when the pacifists start arming themselves.\"\n\nBut something else is happening in between the tourniquet twists of Stop the Bleed trainings and the metal scratch of a chamber reload.

Report says Republicans are losing ground","text":"As the United States heads to midterms, multiple reports and opinion polls suggested that US President Donald Trump's Republican Party is losing ground on the one issue it has been championing for: Immigration. For years, the Grand Old Party (GOP) had solid support for their stance on immigration.\nThe support remained constant despite Trump's provocative remarks on immigration. From pledging to \"deporting all Muslims\" in 2016 to propagating baseless claims that migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets, Trump and supporters laid it all out and still immigration continued to remain the GOP's winning issue.\nHowever, the tides are changing. Both the Trump administration and the Republican Party are losing their rock-solid ground because of what is happening in Minnesota. The killing of two people in Minneapolis in two separate incidents this past month has led to a loud public backlash, souring voters on the GOP’s approach. Overall, the incidents have eroded Trump's standing on the issue ahead of the looming midterms.\nWhat the figures are saying\nA swath of public polling shows that Trump has been the issue ahead of the looming midterms. This week, a Reuters/Ipsos poll revealed that Trump hit a second-term trough on the issue, with 58 per cent of Americans saying his crackdown has \"gone too far\". Meanwhile, only 39 per cent of respondents approved of his handling of immigration.\nA separate poll conducted by the Democratic-aligned Searchlight Institute this week found that 58 per cent of likely midterm voters want ICE reined in. “The image that has been created is not a good thing,” Jose Arango, the Republican chair of Hudson County, New Jersey, a heavily Democratic area with a large Hispanic population that shifted rightward in 2024, told Politico. “We’re losing in the public relations campaign.”\nEven before the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, Trump voters opposed the president's agenda. According to the latest poll conducted by Politico, more than 1 in 3 Trump voters said that while they support his immigration agenda, they disapprove of the way he is implementing it.\nDonald's 'trump card' at stake\nFormer US President Joe Biden's administration was electorally exposed on the issue of immigration, causing Trump to gain significant ground during the 2024 US Presidential Elections. However, his enforcement actions ultimately focused less on the border, which polls show most voters approve of, and more on the nation’s interior, drawing the ire of Republican supporters.\n“The president can feel, generally, that his policies at the border have been largely supported by a majority of Americans. But what he’s doing inside the border seems not to be working,” said Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt, a Republican who runs one of the most conservative large cities in the nation but backed Kamala Harris in 2024.\nThe poll figures and the experts' interpretation of them beg the question: Is the party in danger of ceding one of its best issues back to Democrats? “Immigration used to be a winning issue for Democrats back when we made clear we took enforcement seriously,” Adam Jentleson, the former chief of staff to Sen. John Fetterman (D-Penn.) and top aide to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), told Politico. The shift has become concerning for the Republicans since the midterms are right around the corner.\nWith inputs from agencies.","url":"https://www.firstpost.com/world/united-states/has-trump-overplayed-his-immigration-card-report-says-republicans-are-losing-ground-13974655.html","image":"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2026/01/Firstpost-2026-01-02T110008.236-2026-01-6ee7eeeacc81a41e598e88179df57114.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 05:06:19","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.297},{"id":398198038,"title":"Former Ben & Jerry’s Cofounder Debuts ‘Maxi Hearts of Minneapolis’ Ice Cream Honoring Renee Good, Alex Pretti","text":"Announcing his newest ice cream flavor, Ben Cohen, cofounder of Ben & Jerry’s proclaimed, “We all need to stand up to march to protest, because all of America is Minneapolis now.”\n\n“The flavor I’m making today is called ‘The Maxi Hearts of Minneapolis,’” Cohen stated in a video. “Amidst all the horror and sadness, I’m encouraged by the spirit of Minneapolis. Finally, a community that’s standing up and putting their bodies on the line for compassion and decency and justice.”\n\nThe base of the ice cream blends coconut and passion fruit, flavors Cohen says are favorites of the immigrant community. The mix-in “chunks” include three types of hearts: salted caramel, chocolate, and red. Cohen explains that the caramel hearts “represent the tears that we cry for Renee and Alex, and the sweat of the hard work that we’ll be doing for justice in their memory.” The chocolate hearts “represent the love with which we will do that work,” and the red hearts are intended to symbolize “the hearts of people all over our country going out to the family and friends of Renee and Alex.”\n\nPrinted on the ice cream container is the message: “This flavor is a tribute to the grit and the spirit of the people of Minneapolis, who are leading with their hearts and putting their bodies on the line for justice and compassion. We especially honor the lives of Renee and Alex who were murdered by the masked, militarized, heavily armed thugs of ICE.”\n\nCohen used the announcement to declare, “ICE is a masked, lawless rogue paramilitary force that’s blatantly violating the Constitution and trampling on our rights as US citizens. It must be defunded and disbanded.” \n\nDrawing a line between his activism and the corporate brand, Cohen noted: “This is not a Ben and Jerry’s flavor. It’s a Ben’s Best flavor, because Ben and Jerry’s is also under a form of occupation, and they’re not going to say it, so I will.”\n\nPrevious politically themed flavors tied to either Ben Cohen directly or the Ben & Jerry’s brand have included “Justice ReMix’d” supporting prison reform, “Change Is Brewing” backing Rep. Cori Bush’s policing bill, “Kamala’s Coconut Jubilee” promoted in a get-out-the-vote campaign for Vice President Kamala Harris, and “Bernie’s Back,” a cinnamon-and-chocolate tribute to Bernie Sanders created by Cohen as a limited-edition release.\n\nBen Cohen and Jerry Greenfield co‑founded Ben & Jerry’s and sold the company to Unilever in 2000 under a unique governance agreement intended to preserve its social mission. In 2025, Greenfield publicly left the brand, citing Unilever’s alleged silencing of its values and independence. That same year, Cohen attempted to repurchase the company, but Unilever declined to sell. The company has since spun off its ice cream assets into a new, standalone entity called the Magnum Ice Cream Company.\n\nThe flavor Maxi Hearts of Minneapolis references two recent lethal incidents. Renee Good was shot on January 7 after allegedly accelerating her vehicle toward an ICE agent during an enforcement operation in Minneapolis. Federal authorities have stated the vehicle was used as a weapon, while her partner, Becca Good, is reportedly under investigation for potentially impeding federal officers. Video footage shows Becca challenging agents before the shots were fired, with some suggesting she encouraged Renee to “drive,” though others dispute the clarity of her words.\n\nAlex Pretti was killed by federal agents on January 24 in a separate incident. Days earlier, he was recorded on video yelling profanities at agents, calling them “trash,” and daring them to assault him. Federal immigration officers had reportedly documented information about Pretti before the shooting. He brought a firearm with him on January 24, the day he was fatally shot.","summary":"Announcing his newest ice cream flavor, Ben Cohen, cofounder of Ben &#038; Jerry’s proclaimed, “We all need to stand up to march to protest, because all of America is Minneapolis now.”\n\n\nThe post Former Ben &amp; Jerry’s Cofounder Debuts ‘Maxi Hearts of Minneapolis’ Ice Cream Honoring Renee Good, Alex Pretti appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2026/01/31/former-ben-jerrys-cofounder-debuts-maxi-hearts-of-minneapolis-ice-cream-honoring-renee-good-alex-pretti/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/Ben-and-Jerrys-Ben-Cohen-Held-by-Police-1Inset-Ice-Cream-640x335.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 05:00:23","author":"Jasmyn Jordan","authors":["Jasmyn Jordan"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":398178608,"title":"House GOP’s already fragile majority to further shrink after Democrats’ ballot box victory","text":"Democrat Christian Menefee, a former attorney for Houston’s Harris County, has won a special congressional election in a left-leaning congressional district in Texas, which has been vacant for nearly a year.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that Menefee defeated former Houston City Council member Amanda Edwards, a fellow Democrat, in Saturday’s runoff election to fill the seat left vacant when Democratic Rep.

Democrats Christian Menefee, 37, a former Harris County attorney, and Amanda Edwards, 44, a former Houston city council member, are vying to represent Texas' 18th Congressional District, a solidly Democratic area encompassing much of the inner city of Houston and the surrounding region. A winner had not been announced as of 11:15 p.m. CST (0224 GMT), more than three hours after polls closed. In filling a seat that has been vacant for most of the past year, Democrats will shrink Republicans' already narrow majority. The winner will replace the late Representative Sylvester Turner, who served only two months in the House before his death in March. Menefee and Edwards were the top two vote-getters in a field of 16 candidates in last November's election, requiring Saturday's runoff. Republicans hold a 218-213 House majority. Democrats will insist upon a prompt swearing-in for the winner of the Saturday's vote, tightening the Republican lead to 218-214. Three House vacancies in Georgia, New Jersey and California are scheduled to be filled by special elections in March, April and August, respectively. Last year, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, enraged Democrats when he delayed the swearing-in of now-Representative Adelita Grijalva following a special election in Arizona. She won that contest in September but was not sworn-in until mid-November. In the coming weeks, Congress could vote on contentious issues, including legislation that would impose tougher operating procedures on federal immigration agents in Minneapolis and other cities throughout the nation. An attempt to reinstate a federal health insurance subsidy also remains a priority for many lawmakers. Both measures, if they materialize, could be among several items decided by tight votes. Democrats have fared well in special elections since the beginning of last year, boosting the party's hopes of winning control of the House in November's midterm congressional elections, especially given Republican President Donald Trump's anemic popularity at the moment. This Texas special election, however, is not expected to provide insights into which party might prevail in November. In the 2024 presidential election, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won the district over Trump 69%-29%. All 435 House seats will be up for grabs in November. The party that holds the White House typically loses seats in the midterms.

The operation has sparked nationwide outrage after two US citizens, Alex Pretti and Renee Good, were shot dead within weeks of each other.\nAddressing the audience, Springsteen said the song was written for “the people of Minneapolis, the people of Minnesota, and the people of our good country, the United States of America,” AFP reported.\nThe veteran musician revealed that after finishing the song, he shared it with Tom Morello, former frontman of Rage Against The Machine.

Bush’s Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and then Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, saved the banking system and the economy from Armageddon by flooding the system with cheap money when it needed it most. \n\nWhat Warsh did next, in my opinion, was even more important. \n\nEffectively, he cast himself as a Cassandra, warning that a policy that worked well in the middle of a crisis was now setting the economy up for runaway inflation, the most important concern for any Fed chair. \n\nNow decamped to Stanford University as an academic, he began firing off columns on the need to rein in the Fed. \n\nHe saw — and rightly criticized — Bernanke, then Janet Yellen and the current Fed chair, Jerome Powell, who was appointed during Trump 1, for continuing to juice the economy, printing money and steering longer-term interest rates lower as if they were part of the White House’s economic team. \n\nHe took aim at the central bank’s ever-broader policy pursuits, its support of lefty social issues, stuff like Diversity Equity and Inclusion hiring practices, and Environmental, Social, Governance investing. \n\nThis wasn’t just because DEI was illegal, and ESG was foolhardy, it was also because the Fed in taking these left turns also took its eye off the inflation ball and its mandate as the nation’s central bank. \n\nBy the Biden years, with Powell still in charge and still printing money, Warsh’s prognostications were an unfortunate reality. \n\nInflation raged to 9%, a noxious tax on the working class that doesn’t have the disposable income to speculate around its ravages with financial assets. \n\nFinally, Powell stopped printing money and raised rates, but the damage was done. With so much money sloshing around, prices remained elevated (as they do today), which is why Donald Trump, warts and all, would have defeated Joe Biden and did beat Biden’s equally economically illiterate vice president, Kamala Harris, in the 2024 presidential election. \n\nDidn’t listen to the pro \n\nYes, average folks tend to look past indictments and mean tweets when stuff like food, housing and energy becomes unaffordable because the president and his policymakers didn’t listen to Kevin Warsh. \n\nThe question is, will Trump will listen? \n\nWarsh, once confirmed by the Senate, will take over when Powell’s term ends on May 15.\n\nInflation remains elevated above its target rate of 2%, but Trump wants lower rates, which makes his pick of a hawk like Warsh an odd one. \n\nRecall, Warsh beat out one-time Trump favorite Kevin Hassett, chief of the president’s National Economic Council, who seemed prepared to run the most accommodative Fed in years.\n\nOne reason Trump went with Warsh, I am told, is that the president listened to Wall Street and heard you can’t have a patsy at the Fed willing to inflate the economy at all costs if you want people to buy your debt, and Warsh is pretty far from a patsy. \n\nPlus, Warsh will meet Trump halfway. \n\nYes, he will address the president’s obsession for lower short-term rates that the Fed controls, but Warsh knows the real interest rates that matter are those on the 10-year Treasury, to which consumer borrowing rates are pegged and which is controlled by bond traders who hate inflation. \n\nWith that in mind, Warsh will thread the needle, lowering short-term rates while he downsizes the Fed’s massive balance sheet, essentially taking all that extra money out of the economy to appease bond traders as he sells the central bank’s large portfolio of debt retained during Powell’s money-printing spree. \n\nIt will keep a lid on the 10-year yield and hopefully bring inflation closer to its target rate. \n\nIt will be a balancing act, but if anyone can do it, it’s Kevin Warsh.","summary":"Warsh will thread the needle, lowering short-term rates while he downsizes the Fed’s massive balance sheet.","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/01/31/business/kevin-warsh-tapped-as-next-fed-reserve-chairman-is-one-of-trumps-smartest-moves-a-partnership-he-needs-to-make-work/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/EKDEMD1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 03:39:29","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.096},{"id":398321348,"title":"LA Olympics chair breaks silence over flirty emails sent to Ghislaine Maxwell while his wife was pregnant","text":"The Hollywood mogul in charge of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics says he 'deeply regrets' his raunchy emails discussing 'massages,' 'rubbing' and naked beach frolics with Jeffrey Epstein's partner in crime, Ghislaine Maxwell, in a statement to the Daily Mail.\n\nThe 2003 emails from LA talent agency chief and 2028 Olympic Committee Chair Casey Wasserman were revealed in the latest giant tranche of Epstein files released by the Department of Justice on Friday morning.\n\nIn his statement, Wasserman said: 'I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell, which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light. \n\n'I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,' Wasserman claimed. 'As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. \n\n'I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them,' he concluded.\n\nWasserman, 51, was less than two years into his marriage to then-wife Laura Ziffren when he swapped highly flirtatious messages with Maxwell, asking her on April 1, 2003: 'Where are you, I miss you. I will be in NYC for 4 days starting april 22… can we book that massage now?'\n\nAmid a flurry of messages two days later Maxwell, 64, wrote 'all that rubbing - are you sure you can take it?'\n\n'There are a few spots that apparently drive a man wild - I suppose I could practise them on you and you could let me know if they work or not?' she added.\n\nWhile the two were trading the risqué messages and arranging the sensual massage, his wife was eight months pregnant with their son.\n\nWasserman is a major figure in Hollywood as a top music and movie agency chief behind such music greats as Coldplay and Ed Sheeran. He also brought Billie Eilish into his roster by acquiring music agency Paradigm in 2021.\n\nVIP guests to his 600-person 50th birthday bash in Santa Monica in June 2024 included former president Bill Clinton, ex-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Vice President Kamala Harris's husband Doug Emhoff.\n\nAbsent — and behind bars for grooming, trafficking, and abusing minors with Epstein — was Maxwell.\n\nMaxwell signed off many of her messages to him with 'Kisses', and he with 'xoxo', the emails released by the DOJ reveal.\n\nWhen Wasserman described LA's often overcast June weather in one 2003 email, Maxwell replied with a raunchy response.\n\n'What foggy enough so that you can float naked down the beach and no one can see you unless they are close up?' she wrote in the April 7, 2003 email, adding: 'Or something like that…'\n\nOn April 6, 2003, Maxwell wrote him: 'Thought you might like to know I am now in Paris - can I bring you back anything from Here?'\n\nHe replied: 'The only thing that i want from paris is you.'\n\nThe next day Maxwell was discussing combinations of edible treats she could bring him from her trip to London.\n\n'Ok, so that combo did not do it for you, what combo would then?' She asked. 'You, me, and not else much…' he replied.\n\nOther emails show Maxwell arranging a trip from Los Angeles to New York on his jet.\n\nThe Daily Mail previously obtained an undated photo of a younger Wasserman with Epstein and Maxwell in front of a private plane.\n\nFlight logs from Epstein's jet show Wasserman and his then-wife flew with Epstein, Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker to Africa for an HIV charity event in 2002.\n\nThere is no suggestion Wasserman took part in any of Epstein's crimes, and the Africa trip took place before the criminal investigation into his sex trafficking began.\n\nThe highly flirtatious messages may prove embarrassing for the LA28 chief, who has already had to contend with allegations of repeated romantic affairs with his own staffers that allegedly occurred throughout his marriage.\n\nEleven sources — including some of his alleged mistresses — provided information to the Daily Mail in 2024 about his alleged womanizing over the years.\n\nWasserman reportedly 'love bombed' potential conquests, showered them with Louboutin shoes, La Perla lingerie, handbags, and even Range Rovers – but when his interest wained, he callously dropped them like a hot potato, sources claimed.\n\nHe was accused of a string of romantic relationships with his employees – including his secretary Patricia Feau, who now works in a $350,000 salary job on the LA28 Olympic nonprofit, his former private jet flight attendant Jenny Chandler, who is his current girlfriend, and another flight attendant whose clients include the Playboy publisher.\n\nFeau denied the affair when contacted by the Daily Mail. Wasserman did not respond, but later dismissed the allegations as gossip.\n\n'If The Daily Mail qualifies as reporting, then I guess we're all in trouble,' Wasserman told CNBC in September 2024.

Centre founder and CEO Imran Ahmed, said Musk has \"enabled\" creation of such images.\n\n\"The data is clear: Elon Musk's Grok is a factory for the production of sexual abuse material,\" he said in a statement to the Austin American-Statesman.\n\n\"Belated fixes cannot undo this harm. We must hold Big Tech accountable for giving abusers the power to victimise women and girls at the click of a button.\"\n\nThe new report comes with Grok facing condemnation over inappropriate images made without subjects' consent and investigation and regulatory action under way in the US and around the world.\n\nIn Texas, House Democrats have called on Attorney General Ken Paxton to investigate the issue. Last week, a bipartisan group of 35 attorneys general sent a letter demanding that xAI take additional action to prevent Grok from generating such nonconsensual images.\n\nOn Monday, the European Union opened a formal investigation to examine whether Texas-based X is fulfilling its obligations under the Digital Services Act, the bloc's rules for keeping Internet users safe from harmful content and products.\n\nUK regulator Ofcom had earlier launched an investigation. Several other countries are also investigating.\n\nResearchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate said it reached its conclusions by analysing a random sample of 20,000 images from the total of 4.6 million produced by Grok's image-generation feature during the time studied.\n\nResearchers analysed each of the sampled posts using an OpenAI model to assess sexualised imagery and age. The model was instructed to score the likelihood that the post's image contained sexualised depictions, photorealistic depictions and minors.\n\nImages flagged by the tool as likely depicting a child were reviewed manually to confirm that the person appeared to clearly be under the age of 18.\n\nAll sexualised images of children were reported to the Internet Watch Foundation. The images the center's survey found depicted people wearing transparent bikinis or micro-bikinis or women wearing only dental floss, saran wrap or transparent tape.\n\nPublic figures identified in sexualised images include Taylor Swift, Swedish Deputy Prime Minister Ebba Busch and former US Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAshley St. Clair, the mother of Musk's son, Romulus, also accused xAI of generating images of her undressed and has filed suit in New York over the explicit images.\n\nMusk's company sued her back, arguing that disputes with X and xAI must be filed in Texas.\n\nEven after the centre's research period, sexualised images remained.\n\nAs of Jan 15, 29% of sexualised images of children identified in the sample of 20,000 were still publicly accessible in posts on X, the centre said. xAI did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs of this week, Grok reportedly still is generating undressed images of people without their consent. Though Musk has said that \"anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,\" he has denied being aware of any naked underage images generated by the tool.\n\nIn recent days, Musk has continued to promote Grok and drawn attention to its supposed popularity, saying 5.5 billion images have been generated in the last 30 days with its feature that creates images from text prompts. – San Antonio Express-News/Tribune News Service","url":"https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2026/02/01/elon-musk039s-grok-generated-3-million-sexualised-images-in-just-11-days-new-analysis-finds","image":"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2026/01/30/3746182.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 03:00:00","author":"Andrea Guzmán","authors":["Andrea Guzmán"],"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":398162770,"title":"Trailblazing Leadership: Stanley Richards, Formerly Incarcerated Advocate, Appointed to Transform NYC Jails","text":"In a groundbreaking move, Mayor Mamdani revealed on Saturday afternoon his selection of five new commissioners to lead various city agencies. Among these appointments, the standout is Stanley Richards, a former inmate, who will now head the Department of Correction—a first in the city’s history.\n\nRichards, once incarcerated at Rikers Island, brings a unique perspective to his new role. As a former executive vice president at The Fortune Society, he is well-equipped to lead the charge in reforming New York City’s jails with a focus on safety and rehabilitation.\n\nMayor Mamdani emphasized the significance of Richards’ appointment, stating, “This achievement goes beyond symbolism. It underscores the profound insight and leadership he will offer to the Correction staff and those incarcerated in New York.”\n\nRichards’ journey from serving a four-and-a-half-year sentence for robbery in the late 1980s to becoming a reform advocate is remarkable. At The Fortune Society, he dedicated his efforts to preparing individuals for life after prison, facilitating their reintegration into society.\n\nReflecting on his personal journey, Richards expressed, “My life story is proof that with support and a focus on hope, rather than fear, we can transcend our past mistakes. When we recognize our shared humanity over our differences, incredible achievements become possible.”\n\nRichards also praised Mayor Mamdani’s vision, noting, “His administration has articulated that the future of Rikers Island is not about perpetual confinement or vilification. Instead, it’s centered on safety, transparency, and rehabilitation. This vision aligns perfectly with my own—creating safer jails and borough-based facilities that emphasize dignity, opportunity, and humanity.”\n\nIn a statement, Benny Boscio, the president of the Correction Officers Benevolent Association union, said of Richard’s appointment, “Despite the many false narratives that have portrayed COBA as an ‘obstacle to reform,’ we have been ready, willing and able to meet and work with anyone, as long as they respect the rights of our Correction Officers and understand that their safety and security matter. … It is our hope that Mr. Richards understands that dynamic as he takes on this new role and demonstrates a commitment to putting safety and security before any political ideology.”\n\nMamdani also named Dr. Alister Martin as commissioner of the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Martin is an emergency physician and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, having previously served as an adviser in the Office of the Vice President under Kamala Harris and a White House Fellow in the White House Office of Public Engagement.\n\n“A city is only as vibrant as it is healthy, and in Dr. Martin, an emergency room physician with extensive experience on the front lines of public health, as well as at the highest levels of government, New Yorkers will be well looked after,” Mamdani said.\n\nSandra Escamilla-Davies will serve as the new commissioner of the Department of Youth and Community Development after serving as the executive vice president of Children’s Aid.\n\n“As commissioner of DYCD, she will do more to build after-school programs and expanding the summer youth employment program,” Mamdani said. “She will work every day to ensure that every child in this city can imagine a future of health, joy and a possibility in a place that they call home.”\n\nYesenia Mata, a former military police sergeant in the U.S. Army and executive director for La Colmena NYC, will serve as the new commissioner of the Department of Veterans’ Services.\n\n“Yesenia will continue that work fighting for the 135,000 veterans who call this city home and ensuring they are able to access the housing, the health care, the supportive services that they sacrificed so much for,” Mamdani said.\n\nFormer commissioner of the city’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection Vilda Vera Mayuga will serve as the new head of the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, or OATH.\n\n“In addition to having served in state government in a number of roles where she advanced civil rights and advocated for workers, as OATH commissioner she will oversee our city’s independent administrative law court and make justice the expectation for every New Yorker,” Mamdani said of Mayuga.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn a groundbreaking move, Mayor Mamdani revealed on Saturday afternoon his selection&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trailblazing Leadership: Stanley Richards, Formerly Incarcerated Advocate, Appointed to Transform NYC Jails first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trailblazing-leadership-stanley-richards-formerly-incarcerated-advocate-appointed-to-transform-nyc-jails/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mamdani-names-Stanley-Richards-formerly-incarcerated-criminal-justice-reformer-to.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 02:32:44","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.365},{"id":398175662,"title":"Utah Expands Supreme Court Ahead Of Redistricting Appeal","text":"The Utah Supreme Court expanded Saturday from five justices to seven with the stroke of a pen by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox.\n\nCox signed S.B. 134 into law, adding two now-vacant seats to Utah’s highest court effective immediately. The court will hear an anticipated case over which U.S. House map the state will use for November’s midterm elections, multiple outlets reported. The bill did not receive a single “yes” vote from a Democrat in either chamber of the Utah State Legislature, although over 70% of Republicans in each chamber voted for it.\n\nThe Court’s expansion comes five months after District Court Judge Dianna Gibson — an appointee of Cox’s predecessor, former Republican Utah Gov. Gary Herbert — ruled in August 2025 the state must redraw its congressional map. Gibson criticized the map presently in use as “partisan gerrymandering.” The state’s Republicans are appealing the ruling, which effectively gives Democrats a one-seat advantage in the midterms, to the Utah Supreme Court. (RELATED: Judge Tosses Utah GOP Map Over ‘Partisan Gerrymandering,’ Orders Districts Redrawn)\n\nAll four of Utah’s House districts are currently held by Republicans; all voted for President Donald Trump by at least 19 percentage points in the 2024 presidential election. In November 2025, Gibson approved a map which redraws one seat to be safely Democratic, as it voted for Kamala Harris by over 20 points in 2024. This all but guarantees one seat will flip from red to blue if the map is used for the midterms.\n\nWith Cox’s nominees to fill the two newly created seats on the Court, five of its seven justices would be his appointees. The Utah State Senate — where Republicans have a supermajority, controlling 22 out of 29 seats — needs to approve each of Cox’s nominees in order for them to be seated.\n\nAll five justices currently on the Court were appointed by Republican governors: one by former Republican Utah Gov.

This preening void of a film offers nothing interesting, let alone meaningful, and has no apparent purpose beyond making people appreciate the US First Lady a little more in all her faux, wannabe-royal glory. The ungrateful peasants.\n\nEven in that, its most basic and cynical aim, it faceplants.\n\nThis film insults us, the audience, by wasting our time. It somehow also manages to insult Melania herself, making her seem almost impossibly vacuous, as though the sentence “there’s no there, there” has taken human form and gained an approximation of sentience.\n\nMelania begins with an assertion, made by the First Lady herself in a voiceover, that “everyone wants to know” more about her. Let’s grant that dubious premise.\n\nWhat more might we like to know about this woman? Here was my question going in, and I think it’s a natural one, based on how little she gives away in her public appearances: is there a person of substance there, underneath the mechanical, well-practised model’s smile?\n\nThere must be. Surely there must be. No human is an empty vessel, drifting through life with neither passion nor any discernible motive.\n\nMelania’s terminal sin is not its failure to answer that question, but to even ask it. Never before now have I seen a documentary that is so fundamentally incurious about its subject. It’s one of the laziest examples of its genre ever made.\n\nA sample of my notes, from 40 minutes in: “I have learned nothing about this woman yet, and am starting to suspect there is nothing to learn.”\n\nWhat a catastrophic impression to get from any documentary. Or any person, for that matter.\n\nMelania is like a horror film with nothing scary in it, or a crime thriller with no twists, or an action film with no fighting. It is a documentary with no interest in exploring its central figure beneath her most superficial level. It is incomprehensibly empty.\n\nI should tell you what actually is in the movie.\n\nA film crew followed Melania around for twenty days leading up to the inauguration, in January of last year, and ... actually there is no “and”. That’s it. They trotted along behind the First Lady, capturing what mostly amounted to either silence or inane chitchat, cut it into 104 minutes, and apparently felt the job was done.\n\nI cannot stress enough: that really is it. No work has gone into this. It is half-arsed, incomplete, the filmmaking equivalent of you showing up to work, hiding in the loo and scrolling TikTok for eight hours, then expecting plaudits and a corner office.\n\nWhy isn’t there a proper sitdown interview with Melania? Why doesn’t she field a single challenging or even vaguely probing question? I’m not asking for a Jeremy Paxman grilling here; just any attempt to seek information would have been nice.\n\nHow is it even possible to spend three weeks with someone and not ask them a single interesting question? I have more riveting conversations with the wall of my shower each morning than anything you’ll witness on screen here.\n\nAmazon threw money at the Trump family, by the way, tens of millions of US dollars, to get the rights to this documentary. They doubled that spend to market it. Preposterous sums for a film of this genre, giving it little chance of making a profit, or of being seen as anything more than a vehicle for Jeff Bezos to suck up to the Trumps.\n\nAnd what, Melania couldn’t put aside 40 minutes, as thanks? Did the creators even ask?\n\nVery, very few of the words you hear from her in this film are recorded organically. They instead come in the form of voiceovers, read woodenly from a script that often sounds like it was written by an undergraduate intern.\n\nThink: world’s longest press release turned into a self-narrated audiobook. Where is the value in that? What do we learn from that? Bugger all, is what. Halfway through the film Melania’s stream of disembodied platitudes fades into white noise.\n\nAnd speaking of voices, why aren’t there more of them?\n\nCould the creators seriously not be bothered to find, I dunno, three or four people who know Melania well, and could provide genuine insight into her personality? No no, too much work.\n\nAgain I have failed to tell you much about what actually is on screen, and I’ll explain why. When it comes to Melania the film and indeed, it seems, Melania the person, what is there is less interesting than what isn’t there.\n\nBrett Ratner and his team have offered so little to the audience that it’s more interesting to discuss what is missing.\n\nAnd Melania Trump is a figure we occasionally find interesting, from afar, not because of her personality but because she appears not to have one.\n\nHow many times can a person be expected to sit through footage of the woman exiting a car, boarding a plane, flying for a bit, disembarking, entering another vehicle, and getting dropped off at one of her mansions, all of it done near-wordlessly, save for the occasional “hello”, before the boredom calcifies?\n\nIt’s the aesthetic, the wealth porn of Succession – rich people being ferried between expensive properties on private planes – with none of the show’s dialogue or wit.\n\nBeing wealthy is not a personality. It is set dressing. The things that you own tell me nothing about who you are. Every moment of this film that reads as a Succession cosplay is wasted.\n\nWhat meaning are we to draw from multiple scenes of Melania, with her high-priced fashion team, trying on dresses in her New York City penthouse?\n\n“We did two different shoulders for you,” a stylist says.\n\n“Well, I will try it,” she replies.\n\nSpellbinding cinema.\n\nMeanwhile behind her, through the gilded window, way wayyyy below, we see Central Park, and the Upper West Side, and the Bronx far off in the distance. Down there are people living lives of real struggle and, to borrow Melania’s new favourite word, “purpose”.\n\nGive one of them a documentary and $40 million. I guarantee it will be more compelling than watching a fabulously rich person play dress-up.\n\nWhat else can I complain about?\n\nHow many times can we observe Melania and her husband walking through some corridors, sharing no conversation of any substance, as though they’re distant acquaintances rather than spouses, before we conclude their relationship is actually quite dull?\n\nAt the back end of the movie, we see them attend three consecutive inauguration day balls.\n\nIt’s almost the same footage, three times in a row: Donald and Melania wait backstage, they’re announced to the audience as the President and First Lady, then they dance for a bit. Almost five minutes of that!\n\nTheir marriage does however provide the singular amusing moment, across all 104 minutes. I can’t believe the creators included it, to be honest, as it makes Donald sound like a child in a septuagenarian’s body, but that is on them.\n\n“I won every swing state!” Donald boasts to his wife over the phone, the night after Congress certified his election win over Kamala Harris, with the energy of a kid who just got an A+ on his book report.\n\n“That’s a big deal! OK talk to you soon, bye,” comes Melania’s hilariously patronising reply.\n\nYou can find some other sparse morsels of levity, if you try, again thanks to some curious editing decisions.\n\n“During my last term, I restored the Rose Garden,” Melania recalls. She’s palpably proud of it. Of course a few months after the quote was recorded, her husband dug up the garden and replaced it with a concrete patio.\n\nShe spends some time praising the White House’s East Wing, and recruiting staff for it. Donald has now demolished it to build a ballroom.\n\n“Never take individual rights for granted. Because in the end, wherever we come from, we are bound by the same humanity,” Melania says in one voiceover, apparently blissfully ignorant of the way her husband has been speaking about other human beings for his entire life. Did you know he’s been calling a whole nationality of people “garbage” lately? \n\nWhy would they include these little ironies? No idea. But I clung to them as small brushstrokes of colour on an otherwise bafflingly blank canvas.\n\nDo not go into Melania expecting a Trumpy version of Meghan Markle’s intolerable Netflix show With Love, Meghan. That is the comparison I expected to draw heading in, to be honest, but it doesn’t work, because even that ordeal possesses something this film lacks.\n\n(Meghan fans, maybe skip a couple of paragraphs here, but I promise I’m making a point.)\n\nWith Love is a bottomless font of empty, insincere Californian whimsy, and self-absorption masquerading as humility. It seems to exist purely so Meghan can soak in the praise of other celebrities on camera.\n\nBut. Meghan does have a sort of negative charisma that makes her hatewatchable. There’s stuff going on behind her eyes that is not being shared with the viewer; it’s palpable. So even when she’s doing blatant self-promotion, you have intrigue. There is something there, something to parse and interpret.\n\nYou can’t say the same of Melania Trump. You watch her here, for nearly two hours, and at no point does the mask slip. Perhaps there is actually nothing beneath it. More likely, though, is that she’s been failed catastrophically by the creators of this documentary.\n\nThe almost tragic irony is that, in attempting to deliver a glowing, triumphant puff piece, they have actually managed to make her look bad.\n\nTheir own sloth and disinterest reflect back on her. So Melania comes off as chronically vacuous, clicking from meaningless event to equally meaningless event in her heels as though on autopilot, speaking polite greetings, never offending, but never saying anything worth hearing either.\n\nIt is the job, of a documentary-maker, to break through the surface and show us what lies underneath. To bring that mask down, no matter how stubbornly it has been affixed. To probe, challenge, illuminate and inform.\n\nYou could give David Attenborough a film crew, tell him to go and look at some random species of jellyfish that lives in the Aegean Sea for two days, and he would come back with something interesting.\n\nHow is it possible then, how did these people manage, to spend so much time with one of the world’s most powerful women and come back with nothing of value?\n\nMelania: 0.5/5 stars. A pointless film that achieves nothing, insults the person it is trying to celebrate, and bores you while doing it. I considered giving it zero.\n\nIf you want to see this one on a big screen, do it now. It’s not playing in many Australian theatres, and based on the limited session times and limp ticket sales, it will not have a long run.\n\nAlternatively, wait for it to come to streaming, then pop it on while you do the dishes. The washing up will be a nice distraction from the film.","summary":"Nobody really expected the Melania Trump documentary to be much more than a puff piece.

Ilhan Omar of Minnesota was attacked by a Trump supporter during a town hall on Tuesday. The assailant’s social media profile showed racial animosity toward Omar, who is a Black woman, echoing rhetoric from President Donald Trump and other Republicans.\n\nTrump followed up the attack by continuing to smear Omar while also promoting the conspiracy theory that the event had been staged.\n\nThe episode was just the latest in a series of attacks that Trump has leveled against prominent Black women during his time as a national political figure.\n\nFor instance, as part of his longstanding feud with Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas—who has frequently called out his racism and authoritarianism—Trump has insisted that she has a “low IQ.” \n\nRacists have historically asserted that Black people have lower IQs than whites.\n\nIn another episode, Trump tried to get his Justice Department to pursue a criminal case against New York Attorney General Leticia James. Trump has had a chip on his shoulder since James successfully pursued him in court, securing a guilty verdict on 34 felonies.\n\nBut the right’s attacks on Black women are not confined to just Trump.\n\nKamala Harris, who was the first woman and the first Black and Asian person to serve as vice president, was frequently the target of attacks from the right. During her presidential campaign, Trump’s propagandists at Fox News fumed that she used the word “holistic,” describing it as “Kamala Harris’ ‘Holistic’ Word Salad.”\n\nSimilarly, the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, as part of his legacy of racist remarks, went after Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson—the first Black woman to serve on the court. After she was nominated by former President Joe Biden, Kirk said that she was a “recipient of affirmative action” and that she was “unqualified.”\n\nRelated | Republicans struggle to defend Trump's latest racist stunt\n\nIn a memorable moment of mass hysterics, the conservative movement pilloried Michelle Obama, the first Black first lady, because she had the nerve to advocate for healthy diets and exercise for children.\n\nThe modern conservative movement has its roots in racial animosity, particularly directed at Black people. But that animus goes into overdrive when the target is Black women.\n\nMuch of this likely stems from the central role that Black women play in the progressive movement, particularly the political strength of the Democratic Party. Without the support and organization of Black women voters, Democrats would likely not be a viable party.\n\nBlack women are the most reliable voting bloc for the party and have been the demographic most likely to support winning presidential candidates like Biden and Barack Obama. But even when Democratic candidates have lost, they have had the unwavering support of Black women.\n\nFor instance, when Trump defeated Harris in 2024, Black women voted for Harris by a margin of 92% to 7%. Similarly, when Hillary Clinton lost to Trump in 2016, she received 94% of Black women’s votes while Trump received 4%.\n\nThe demographic has historically shown little to no interest in Republican candidates, which no doubt has been a source of frustration.\n\nRight-wing politics has historically centered the concerns of conservative white men over everyone else, and the party’s embrace of faux masculinity has set up a dynamic of subordination to white men. Often, as displayed by politicians like Trump, this animosity is expressed by targeting Black women.\n\nIt isn’t just the politicians who make this choice. Conservative media, most notably Fox News, serves a key role in portraying Black women as the villain in conservative morality plays. Politicians like Trump then play into this narrative, targeting leaders like Omar and Crockett to keep up support among his base.\n\nIn light of this institutional hostility and the clear consensus that Democrats are more open to their concerns, it is unlikely that Black women will join the Republican camp anytime soon. \n\nSo while Republicans continue to bash and demonize them, Black women will use their power at the ballot box.","summary":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic Rep.

Ilhan Omar, whom he called a “scammer,” and Gov. Tim Walz, whom he labeled either corrupt or incompetent.\n\n“The Theft and Fraud in Minnesota is far greater than the 19 Billion Dollars originally projected,” Trump wrote in an early-morning Truth Social post. \n\n“The Biden Administration knew this FRAUD was happening, and did absolutely nothing about it.”\n\nTrump then zeroed in on Omar and Walz, whom he has clashed with repeatedly over the years.\n\n“‘Scammer’ Ilhan Omar and her absolutely terrible friends from Somalia should all be in jail right now or, far worse, send them back to Somalia,” Trump wrote.\n\n“‘Governor’ Waltz [sic] is either the most CORRUPT government official in history, or the most INCOMPETENT. Even a very low IQ person, of which there are many, should have known what was going on in Minnesota!!!” Trump wrote.\n\nTrump has repeatedly singled out Omar in speeches and social media posts, mocking her, accusing her of being a “fraud,” and suggesting she should be removed from the United States. \n\nHe has also accused Omar of committing immigration fraud by marrying her brother — a claim Omar has repeatedly denied.\n\nEarlier this week, after Omar was sprayed with a substance during a Minneapolis town hall, Trump suggested without evidence that she may have staged the incident, again calling her a “fraud.”\n\nOmar, meanwhile, has said that each time Trump uses what she calls “hateful rhetoric” about her and the Somali community, the number of death threats against her increases. \n\nLast month, she described Trump as a “racist,” “bigot,” “xenophobic,” and “Islamophobic” in response to his attacks.\n\nDozens of people — many of them Somali-born or Somali American — have been prosecuted in Minnesota in recent years in connection with large-scale welfare fraud schemes involving food assistance and autism services. \n\nFederal prosecutors have alleged the schemes stole hundreds of millions of dollars from taxpayer-funded programs. \n\nSeparate investigations have also examined alleged fraud in the state’s daycare system.\n\nTrump and Walz have clashed on multiple occasions since Walz became Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, with Trump repeatedly tying the governor to Minnesota’s fraud scandals and accusing him of failed leadership.\n\nThose attacks have intensified as investigations into the fraud have continued.\n\nIn a previous Truth Social post, Trump used an offensive slur to insult Walz, prompting public condemnation and a sharp political feud.","summary":"President Trump has ripped Democratic leaders over the handling of the Minnesota fraud scandal.","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/01/31/us-news/trump-claims-minnesota-fraud-exceeds-19b-blames-biden-administration/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/u-s-president-donald-trump-120124417.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ApOBkc2T-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-31 23:46:19","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.7},{"id":398232316,"title":"Melania film is worse than you even expect","text":"Perfect descriptors for everything Melania, named for its star and producer, lacks.

The ungrateful peasants.\n\nEven in that, its most basic and cynical aim, it faceplants.\n\nThis film insults us, the audience, by wasting our time. It somehow also manages to insult Melania herself, making her seem almost impossibly vacuous, as though the sentence “there’s no there, there” has taken human form and gained an approximation of sentience.\n\nMelania begins with an assertion, made by the First Lady herself in a voiceover, that “everyone wants to know” more about her. Let’s grant that dubious premise.\n\nWhat more might we like to know about this woman? Here was my question going in, and I think it’s a natural one, based on how little she gives away in her public appearances: is there a person of substance there, underneath the mechanical, well-practised model’s smile?\n\nThere must be. Surely there must be. No human is an empty vessel, drifting through life with neither passion nor any discernible motive.\n\nMelania’s terminal sin is not its failure to answer that question, but to even ask it. Never before now have I seen a documentary that is so fundamentally incurious about its subject. It’s one of the laziest examples of its genre ever made.\n\nA sample of my notes, from 40 minutes in: “I have learned nothing about this woman yet, and am starting to suspect there is nothing to learn.”\n\nWhat a catastrophic impression to get from any documentary. Or any person, for that matter.\n\nMelania is like a horror film with nothing scary in it, or a crime thriller with no twists, or an action film with no fighting. It is a documentary with no interest in exploring its central figure beneath her most superficial level. It is incomprehensibly empty.\n\nI should tell you what actually is in the movie.\n\nA film crew followed Melania around for twenty days leading up to the inauguration, in January of last year, and ... actually there is no “and”. That’s it. They trotted along behind the First Lady, capturing what mostly amounted to either silence or inane chitchat, cut it into 104 minutes, and apparently felt the job was done.\n\nI cannot stress enough: that really is it. No work has gone into this. It is half-arsed, incomplete, the filmmaking equivalent of you showing up to work, hiding in the loo and scrolling TikTok for eight hours, then expecting plaudits and a corner office.\n\nWhy isn’t there a proper sitdown interview with Melania? Why doesn’t she field a single challenging or even vaguely probing question? I’m not asking for a Jeremy Paxman grilling here; just any attempt to seek information would have been nice.\n\nHow is it even possible to spend three weeks with someone and not ask them a single interesting question? I have more riveting conversations with the wall of my shower each morning than anything you’ll witness on screen here.\n\nAmazon threw money at the Trump family, by the way, tens of millions of US dollars, to get the rights to this documentary. They doubled that spend to market it. Preposterous sums for a film of this genre, giving it little chance of making a profit, or of being seen as anything more than a vehicle for Jeff Bezos to suck up to the Trumps.\n\nAnd what, Melania couldn’t put aside 40 minutes, as thanks? Did the creators even ask?\n\nVery, very few of the words you hear from her in this film are recorded organically. They instead come in the form of voiceovers, read woodenly from a script that often sounds like it was written by an undergraduate intern.\n\nThink: world’s longest press release turned into a self-narrated audiobook. Where is the value in that? What do we learn from that? Bugger all, is what. Halfway through the film Melania’s stream of disembodied platitudes fades into white noise.\n\nAnd speaking of voices, why aren’t there more of them?\n\nCould the creators seriously not be bothered to find, I dunno, three or four people who know Melania well, and could provide genuine insight into her personality? No no, too much work.\n\nAgain I have failed to tell you much about what actually is on screen, and I’ll explain why. When it comes to Melania the film and indeed, it seems, Melania the person, what is there is less interesting than what isn’t there.\n\nBrett Ratner and his team have offered so little to the audience that it’s more interesting to discuss what is missing.\n\nAnd Melania Trump is a figure we occasionally find interesting, from afar, not because of her personality but because she appears not to have one.\n\nHow many times can a person be expected to sit through footage of the woman exiting a car, boarding a plane, flying for a bit, disembarking, entering another vehicle, and getting dropped off at one of her mansions, all of it done near-wordlessly, save for the occasional “hello”, before the boredom calcifies?\n\nIt’s the aesthetic, the wealth porn of Succession – rich people being ferried between expensive properties on private planes – with none of the show’s dialogue or wit.\n\nBeing wealthy is not a personality. It is set dressing. The things that you own tell me nothing about who you are. Every moment of this film that reads as a Succession cosplay is wasted.\n\nWhat meaning are we to draw from multiple scenes of Melania, with her high-priced fashion team, trying on dresses in her New York City penthouse?\n\n“We did two different shoulders for you,” a stylist says.\n\n“Well, I will try it,” she replies.\n\nSpellbinding cinema.\n\nMeanwhile behind her, through the gilded window, way wayyyy below, we see Central Park, and the Upper West Side, and the Bronx far off in the distance. Down there are people living lives of real struggle and, to borrow Melania’s new favourite word, “purpose”.\n\nGive one of them a documentary and $40 million. I guarantee it will be more compelling than watching a fabulously rich person play dress-up.\n\nWhat else can I complain about?\n\nHow many times can we observe Melania and her husband walking through some corridors, sharing no conversation of any substance, as though they’re distant acquaintances rather than spouses, before we conclude their relationship is actually quite dull?\n\nAt the back end of the movie, we see them attend three consecutive inauguration day balls.\n\nIt’s almost the same footage, three times in a row: Donald and Melania wait backstage, they’re announced to the audience as the President and First Lady, then they dance for a bit.

When it comes to Melania the film and indeed, it seems, Melania the person, what is there is less interesting than what isn’t there.\n\nBrett Ratner and his team have offered so little to the audience that it’s more interesting to discuss what is missing.\n\nAnd Melania Trump is a figure we occasionally find interesting, from afar, not because of her personality but because she appears not to have one.\n\nHow many times can a person be expected to sit through footage of the woman exiting a car, boarding a plane, flying for a bit, disembarking, entering another vehicle, and getting dropped off at one of her mansions, all of it done near-wordlessly, save for the occasional “hello”, before the boredom calcifies?\n\nIt’s the aesthetic, the wealth porn of Succession – rich people being ferried between expensive properties on private planes – with none of the show’s dialogue or wit.\n\nBeing wealthy is not a personality. It is set dressing. The things that you own tell me nothing about who you are. Every moment of this film that reads as a Succession cosplay is wasted.\n\nWhat meaning are we to draw from multiple scenes of Melania, with her high-priced fashion team, trying on dresses in her New York City penthouse?\n\n“We did two different shoulders for you,” a stylist says.\n\n“Well, I will try it,” she replies.\n\nSpellbinding cinema.\n\nMeanwhile behind her, through the gilded window, way wayyyy below, we see Central Park, and the Upper West Side, and the Bronx far off in the distance. Down there are people living lives of real struggle and, to borrow Melania’s new favourite word, “purpose”.\n\nGive one of them a documentary and $40 million. I guarantee it will be more compelling than watching a fabulously rich person play dress-up.\n\nWhat else can I complain about?\n\nHow many times can we observe Melania and her husband walking through some corridors, sharing no conversation of any substance, as though they’re distant acquaintances rather than spouses, before we conclude their relationship is actually quite dull?\n\nAt the back end of the movie, we see them attend three consecutive inauguration day balls.\n\nIt’s almost the same footage, three times in a row: Donald and Melania wait backstage, they’re announced to the audience as the President and First Lady, then they dance for a bit. Almost five minutes of that!\n\nTheir marriage does however provide the singular amusing moment, across all 104 minutes. I can’t believe the creators included it, to be honest, as it makes Donald sound like a child in a septuagenarian’s body, but that is on them.\n\n“I won every swing state!” Donald boasts to his wife over the phone, the night after Congress certified his election win over Kamala Harris, with the energy of a kid who just got an A+ on his book report.\n\n“That’s a big deal! OK talk to you soon, bye,” comes Melania’s hilariously patronising reply.\n\nYou can find some other sparse morsels of levity, if you try, again thanks to some curious editing decisions.\n\n“During my last term, I restored the Rose Garden,” Melania recalls. She’s palpably proud of it. Of course a few months after the quote was recorded, her husband dug up the garden and replaced it with a concrete patio.\n\nShe spends some time praising the White House’s East Wing, and recruiting staff for it. Donald has now demolished it to build a ballroom.\n\n“Never take individual rights for granted. Because in the end, wherever we come from, we are bound by the same humanity,” Melania says in one voiceover, apparently blissfully ignorant of the way her husband has been speaking about other human beings for his entire life. Did you know he’s been calling a whole nationality of people “garbage” lately? \n\nWhy would they include these little ironies? No idea. But I clung to them as small brushstrokes of colour on an otherwise bafflingly blank canvas.\n\nDo not go into Melania expecting a Trumpy version of Meghan Markle’s intolerable Netflix show With Love, Meghan. That is the comparison I expected to draw heading in, to be honest, but it doesn’t work, because even that ordeal possesses something this film lacks.\n\n(Meghan fans, maybe skip a couple of paragraphs here, but I promise I’m making a point.)\n\nWith Love is a bottomless font of empty, insincere Californian whimsy, and self-absorption masquerading as humility. It seems to exist purely so Meghan can soak in the praise of other celebrities on camera.\n\nBut. Meghan does have a sort of negative charisma that makes her hatewatchable. There’s stuff going on behind her eyes that is not being shared with the viewer; it’s palpable. So even when she’s doing blatant self-promotion, you have intrigue. There is something there, something to parse and interpret.\n\nYou can’t say the same of Melania Trump. You watch her here, for nearly two hours, and at no point does the mask slip. Perhaps there is actually nothing beneath it. More likely, though, is that she’s been failed catastrophically by the creators of this documentary.\n\nThe almost tragic irony is that, in attempting to deliver a glowing, triumphant puff piece, they have actually managed to make her look bad.\n\nTheir own sloth and disinterest reflect back on her. So Melania comes off as chronically vacuous, clicking from meaningless event to equally meaningless event in her heels as though on autopilot, speaking polite greetings, never offending, but never saying anything worth hearing either.\n\nIt is the job, of a documentary-maker, to break through the surface and show us what lies underneath. To bring that mask down, no matter how stubbornly it has been affixed. To probe, challenge, illuminate and inform.\n\nYou could give David Attenborough a film crew, tell him to go and look at some random species of jellyfish that lives in the Aegean Sea for two days, and he would come back with something interesting.\n\nHow is it possible then, how did these people manage, to spend so much time with one of the world’s most powerful women and come back with nothing of value?\n\nMelania: 0.5/5 stars. A pointless film that achieves nothing, insults the person it is trying to celebrate, and bores you while doing it. I considered giving it zero.\n\nIf you want to see this one on a big screen, do it now. It’s not playing in many Australian theatres, and based on the limited session times and limp ticket sales, it will not have a long run.\n\nAlternatively, wait for it to come to streaming, then pop it on while you do the dishes.

This preening void of a film offers nothing interesting, let alone meaningful, and has no apparent purpose beyond making people appreciate the US First Lady a little more in all her faux, wannabe-royal glory. The ungrateful peasants.\n\nEven in that, its most basic and cynical aim, it faceplants.\n\nThis film insults us, the audience, by wasting our time. It somehow also manages to insult Melania herself, making her seem almost impossibly vacuous, as though the sentence “there’s no there, there” has taken human form and gained an approximation of sentience.\n\nMelania begins with an assertion, made by the First Lady herself in a voiceover, that “everyone wants to know” more about her. Let’s grant that dubious premise.\n\nWhat more might we like to know about this woman? Here was my question going in, and I think it’s a natural one, based on how little she gives away in her public appearances: is there a person of substance there, underneath the mechanical, well-practised model’s smile?\n\nThere must be. Surely there must be. No human is an empty vessel, drifting through life with neither passion nor any discernible motive.\n\nMelania’s terminal sin is not its failure to answer that question, but to even ask it. Never before now have I seen a documentary that is so fundamentally incurious about its subject. It’s one of the laziest examples of its genre ever made.\n\nA sample of my notes, from 40 minutes in: “I have learned nothing about this woman yet, and am starting to suspect there is nothing to learn.”\n\nWhat a catastrophic impression to get from any documentary. Or any person, for that matter.\n\nMelania is like a horror film with nothing scary in it, or a crime thriller with no twists, or an action film with no fighting. It is a documentary with no interest in exploring its central figure beneath her most superficial level. It is incomprehensibly empty.\n\nI should tell you what actually is in the movie.\n\nA film crew followed Melania around for twenty days leading up to the inauguration, in January of last year, and ... actually there is no “and”. That’s it. They trotted along behind the First Lady, capturing what mostly amounted to either silence or inane chitchat, cut it into 104 minutes, and apparently felt the job was done.\n\nI cannot stress enough: that really is it. No work has gone into this. It is half-arsed, incomplete, the filmmaking equivalent of you showing up to work, hiding in the loo and scrolling TikTok for eight hours, then expecting plaudits and a corner office.\n\nWhy isn’t there a proper sitdown interview with Melania? Why doesn’t she field a single challenging or even vaguely probing question? I’m not asking for a Jeremy Paxman grilling here; just any attempt to seek information would have been nice.\n\nHow is it even possible to spend three weeks with someone and not ask them a single interesting question? I have more riveting conversations with the wall of my shower each morning than anything you’ll witness on screen here.\n\nAmazon threw money at the Trump family, by the way, tens of millions of US dollars, to get the rights to this documentary. They doubled that spend to market it. Preposterous sums for a film of this genre, giving it little chance of making a profit, or of being seen as anything more than a vehicle for Jeff Bezos to suck up to the Trumps.\n\nAnd what, Melania couldn’t put aside 40 minutes, as thanks? Did the creators even ask?\n\nVery, very few of the words you hear from her in this film are recorded organically. They instead come in the form of voiceovers, read woodenly from a script that often sounds like it was written by an undergraduate intern.\n\nThink: world’s longest press release turned into a self-narrated audiobook. Where is the value in that? What do we learn from that? Bugger all, is what. Halfway through the film Melania’s stream of disembodied platitudes fades into white noise.\n\nAnd speaking of voices, why aren’t there more of them?\n\nCould the creators seriously not be bothered to find, I dunno, three or four people who know Melania well, and could provide genuine insight into her personality?

I counted the back of 14 skulls. But this is the first time I’ve witnessed zero audience reaction: no clapping, no laughter, no gasps ... no nothing.\n\nJust expressionless souls exiting as if leaving a seminar on trigonometry.\n\nA wise man once observed, “In feature films the director is God; in documentary films God is the director.” Alas, God was MIA for call time on “Melania.” In his place, director Brett Ratner tried and failed to bring protagonist Melania Trump to life. Fair enough.\n\nIt would be easier to teach a goldfish to tap dance.\n\n“Melania” tracks America’s first lady for 20 days as she preps for her return to Washington before her husband’s second inauguration. Ideally, this would include confessionals, intimate chats, marital insights, something worth watching.\n\nInstead, we get one hour and 44 minutes of glam agitprop. This isn’t a documentary so much as a gauzy infomercial that accidentally reveals the chasm between Melania’s plastic world and the radioactive reality of her husband’s blunt-force liaisons with autocracy one year later.\n\nThe soft-focus cameras can’t blur this high-def disconnect.\n\nMelania mentions the Rose Garden, unaware that months later her husband will pave over the greenery and basically turn it into a Hard Rock patio. She interviews candidates for her new office, unaware that months later her husband will bulldoze her East Wing.\n\nMelania is on a Zoom call with Brigitte Macron.\n\n“Do you know that in United States an average child spends eight hours on the screen?” she asks France’s first lady, before expressing concerns about cyber bullying.\n\nHuh? Didn’t she sign a pre-nup with the biggest bully in modern history?\n\nThere is a drone establishing shot over Mar-a-Lago that is used twice. Why? Because Ratner had nothing to leave on the cutting room floor. Sure, the cheekbones and feline eyes are photogenic. But Melania is as compelling as dental floss. She has the depth of a pothole puddle.\n\nIn one scene, dressmakers with measuring tapes dangling around their necks consult on a gown that makes Melania look like a defective zebra.\n\nEven they look bored senseless.\n\n“The only thing we can do is cherish the moments we have with loved ones,” Melania says, which I ranked in my notes as her deepest thought in the film.\n\nThere is no future career awaiting at Hallmark or even a fortune cookie syndicate.\n\nThe wind chill outside the theatre on Richmond Street made it feel like Mars. Inside, her onscreen presence was colder.\n\nIn another scene, she is in the back of a limo and awkwardly singing along to Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean.” If this was an attempt to show Melania with her hair down, why was the hair on the back of my neck standing up? Carpool karaoke should never feel ominous.\n\nOn the upside, all that Jeff Bezos cheddar allowed Amazon MGM Studios to licence great music: Rolling Stones, Aretha Franklin, Spandau Ballet, Tears for Fears, James Brown, Giorgio Moroder’s “Chase,” which always reminds me of the late Art Bell’s radio show about the paranormal.\n\nBut the music was just an aural patina on the grim reality of Trump 2.0.\n\nIt is “Melania” that is paranormal.\n\nWhether she’s laying a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery or dancing to the “Battle Hymn of the Republic” or arriving at Blair House or lighting a candle at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in memory of her mother, Melania is a ghost in the machine.\n\nHer materialism, her instinct for style over substance, blinds her to the role of extra as she strikes an elegant pose in the background of her husband’s real life horror flick.\n\nShe predicts Donald will be a “peacemaker and unifier.”\n\nEven he is startled by her delusion: “Don’t put that on tape, please.”\n\nThe only vaguely interesting flashes come from B-roll ephemera: Kamala Harris glancing at her watch as if having an out-of-body experience. Elon Musk, eyes closed, during a dinner prayer. Tim Cook looking like a child lost in the mall. Bill Clinton and George W. Bush laughing in disbelief, as if one of them just cracked, “The world is so screwed.”\n\nMelania’s love for son Barron is obvious. What a shame we don’t hear from him. Or any of the Trump nepo babies. We just see Barron towering above everyone else in brooding silence, a young man tall enough to punch Godzilla in the mouth who has nothing to say.\n\n“Melania” puts viewers in private planes and gilded rooms to showcase a woman with refined taste. It does not take viewers into her heart or mind. It tiptoes around the doom in kitten heels until the gossamer becomes a funhouse mirror.\n\nWe get reverence instead of reckoning, access journalism without the journalism.\n\nThe irony is Melania could be a profoundly interesting subject. But that would involve asking tough questions instead of treating her as a ceramic doll behind glass doors. When you are married to the most polarizing figure alive, nobody cares about embossed invites or crystal tableware.\n\nThey want to know if you are even aware of what is happening.\n\n“Melania” is a fairy tale untethered from reality and sprayed with visual perfume.\n\n“Be best to country,” she says, as America burns.","summary":"“Melania” tracks America’s first lady for 20 days as she preps for her return to Washington before her husband Donald Trump’s second inauguration.

It is not a campaign film or a political gloss. It is a deeply human account of transition, responsibility, and resolve, told during the most compressed and emotionally demanding stretch of Melania Trump’s life, as she prepared to assume her second term as first lady of the United States.\n\nThe film shows the complexity of moving from private life back into one of the most scrutinized public roles in the world.\n\nThe film focuses on a narrow but consequential window from January 1 through January 20, 2025, a period that is usually flattened into ceremony and symbolism. Instead, “Melania” lingers in the quiet moments that precede power. It shows a woman balancing the private obligations of motherhood and family with the public demands of leadership. Navigating grief within her own family while preparing to re-enter a national spotlight that rarely affords empathy.\n\nWhat distinguishes the film immediately is its intimacy. The camera follows Melania Trump through the ordinary and the extraordinary: checking in on her son, caring for her father after the loss of his wife, and preparing to return to public life after years away from the East Wing. These scenes are not dramatized. They are observed. The result is a portrayal that feels restrained, grounded, and unmistakably human.\n\n“Melania” also offers access that has never before been granted to a media project. Viewers are brought into high-level meetings with the Secret Service, detailed White House walk-throughs, and internal discussions about staffing, security, and protocol. The level of access surpasses any prior film or documentary involving the modern presidency, and it does so without compromising the seriousness of the subject.\n\nThe film captures the lingering tension in Washington following the failed Kamala Harris presidential campaign. Without editorializing, it documents the complicated interpersonal dynamics and unspoken friction that accompany transitions of power. These moments are subtle, conveyed through body language and silence rather than confrontation, lending the film an unusual credibility.\n\nInternational diplomacy threads its way into the story as well, most notably through an appearance by Queen Rania of Jordan. Their interaction reflects Melania Trump’s long-standing engagement with global humanitarian issues and underscores the often unseen role first ladies play in shaping state relationships\n\nAt its core, “Melania” is about transition. It chronicles how Melania Trump rebuilt her East Wing operation from scratch, assembling a team and setting a tone that was disciplined and intentional. The film shows the complexity of moving from private life back into one of the most scrutinized public roles in the world.\n\nThat same precision defined how the film itself came to life.\n\nFrom the moment the project was introduced to the entertainment industry, it triggered a highly competitive bidding war. Netflix, MGM, Disney, and Paramount all pursued the project intensely, recognizing the rarity of the access and the global interest surrounding Melania Trump’s return to the White House.\n\nNavigating that landscape was Marc Beckman, who has served as Melania Trump’s senior adviser for 25 years. For decades, he has worked closely with her to secure major commercial deals, advance humanitarian initiatives, and shape her public voice. His understanding of media, culture, and negotiation proved critical in steering the project through a crowded field without compromising its integrity.\n\nBeckman brought a long-term, cross-sector perspective to the process. His experience executing campaigns for major global brands and institutions gave him the leverage and insight necessary to evaluate the various competing offers. Together, Beckman and Melania Trump prioritized control, authenticity, and global reach over spectacle.\n\nRELATED: Matt Damon: Netflix dumbs down movies for attention-impaired phone addicts\n\n Photo by Arturo Holmes/WireImage\n\nUltimately, Amazon was selected as the studio partner. The deal was not the result of any back-channel negotiations involving Donald Trump or Jeff Bezos. It was a strategic choice by a first lady determined to protect her story and ensure that it reached a worldwide audience on her terms.\n\nWhile “Melania” remains focused on the human dimensions of leadership, it arrives at a time when the first lady has increasingly asserted herself as a force within the East Wing. Her recent efforts to encourage America’s children to pursue curiosity and ambition, including through responsible engagement with emerging technologies like AI, reflect the broader leadership philosophy that underpins the film.\n\nA two-part docuseries, set for release this summer, will expand on the filmmaking process itself, offering behind-the-scenes insight into how unprecedented access was negotiated and maintained and how a project of this magnitude was executed without losing its soul.\n\nIn an era of political noise and cultural oversaturation, “Melania” stands apart. It is quiet without being passive and powerful without being performative. More than a film, it is a record of how leadership looks before the world is watching — and why that unseen work matters.","url":"https://www.theblaze.com/columns/opinion/new-melania-documentary-blends-unprecedented-access-with-subtle-profound-message","image":"https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/new-melania-documentary-blends-unprecedented-access-with-subtle-profound-message.jpg?id=63527581&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-31 20:00:00","author":"Julio Rivera","authors":["Julio Rivera"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.38},{"id":398100308,"title":"Trump claims Minnesota fraud exceeds $19B, faults Biden administration","text":"President Donald Trump on Saturday ripped Democratic leaders over the massive welfare and daycare fraud scandal in Minnesota, escalating his long-running feuds with Rep. Ilhan Omar, whom he called a \"scammer,\" and Gov. Tim Walz, whom he labeled either corrupt or incompetent. \"The Theft and Fraud in Minnesota is far greater than the 19 Billion Dollars originally projected,\" Trump wrote in an early-morning Truth Social post. \"The Biden Administration knew this FRAUD was happening, and did absolutely nothing about it.\" Trump then zeroed in on Omar and Walz, whom he has clashed with repeatedly over the years. \"'Scammer' Ilhan Omar and her absolutely terrible friends from Somalia should all be in jail right now or, far worse, send them back to Somalia,\" Trump wrote. VANCE CALLS WALZ ‘A JOKE,’ CLAIMS MINNESOTA GOVERNOR ENABLED MASSIVE FRAUD \"'Governor' Waltz [sic] is either the most CORRUPT government official in history, or the most INCOMPETENT. Even a very low IQ person, of which there are many, should have known what was going on in Minnesota!!!\" Trump wrote. Trump has repeatedly singled out Omar in speeches and social media posts, mocking her, accusing her of being a \"fraud,\" and suggesting she should be removed from the United States. He has also accused Omar of committing immigration fraud by marrying her brother — a claim Omar has repeatedly denied. Earlier this week, after Omar was sprayed with a substance during a Minneapolis town hall, Trump suggested without evidence that she may have staged the incident, again calling her a \"fraud.\" TRUMP ACCUSES TIM WALZ AND ILHAN OMAR OF USING ICE PROTESTS TO DISTRACT FROM MASSIVE STATE FRAUD Omar, meanwhile, has said that each time Trump uses what she calls \"hateful rhetoric\" about her and the Somali community, the number of death threats against her increases. Last month, she described Trump as a \"racist,\" \"bigot,\" \"xenophobic,\" and \"Islamophobic\" in response to his attacks. Dozens of people — many of them Somali-born or Somali American — have been prosecuted in Minnesota in recent years in connection with large-scale welfare fraud schemes involving food assistance and autism services. Federal prosecutors have alleged the schemes stole hundreds of millions of dollars from taxpayer-funded programs. Separate investigations have also examined alleged fraud in the state’s daycare system. Trump and Walz have clashed on multiple occasions since Walz became Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, with Trump repeatedly tying the governor to Minnesota’s fraud scandals and accusing him of failed leadership.

In a previous Truth Social post, Trump used an offensive slur to insult Walz, prompting public condemnation and a sharp political feud.","summary":"President Donald Trump renews attacks on Rep.
