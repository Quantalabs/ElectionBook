But if Leavitt is looking for who is fueling the speculation around the dead New York financier and sex criminal who appeared on camera yucking it up with her boss, she needs to remember: the call is coming from inside the (White) house.\n\nEpstein died in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting a second prosecution for his long-rumored sex trafficking of underage girls. His death was ruled a suicide.\n\nAt Monday’s news briefing, the White House spokeswoman sparred with Fox’s Peter Doocy (another bit of unfamiliar turf for her) over whether Attorney General Pam Bondi had specifically referred to the “Epstein Client List” when she told an interviewer she had “it on my desk” earlier this year.\n\nThat remark from Bondi, made during a Fox News interview, has caused headaches for the administration as it published a report stating that Epstein died by suicide and did so without creating a list of names of powerful men directly involved in his sex crimes involving underaged girls. \n\nThe FBI and Justice Department released videos the agencies say show nobody from outside entered the common area at the detention facility where Epstein was held in Manhattan over the time frame between when he was locked in his cell for the evening and the next morning.\n\nAfter Doocy quoted Bondi directly, Leavitt replied, “Yes. She was saying the entirety of all of the paperwork, all of the paper relating to Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes”. Previous court filings have revealed the names of men associated with Epstein, but no definitive proof has emerged linking specific people to crimes, other than Epstein and his convicted “madam”, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nThis of course did not satisfy the online followers of news about Epstein and the rumors about the powerful figures with whom he was in contact. Intrigue over the arrest and death of Epstein in custody was supercharged by video of him with now-President Donald Trump and his extensive known relationships with a wide range of powerful people and institutions, which he cultivated through his financial largesse. Other figures with known ties to Epstein include former President Bill Clinton, Britain’s Prince Andrew, and the institution of Harvard University, where he maintained an office and visited campus after his 2008 sex crimes conviction.\n\nElon Musk, during his public falling-out with the president last month, tweeted and then deleted a message accusing Trump of being in “the Epstein Files”, and said it was the reason the list of Epstein’s famous clients was not being released. His opportunistic charge served to keep the story in the minds of many, and forced a denial from Vice President JD Vance. He renewed his efforts to push that connection after the administration’s announcement.\n\n“First of all, absolutely not. Donald Trump didn't do anything wrong with Jeffrey Epstein,” Vance said on Theo Von’s podcast. “Whatever the Democrats and the media says about him, that's totally BS.”\n\nOn Monday, “Epstein” was the top trend on X/Twitter. Laura Loomer, one of Trump’s occasional White House guests and a semi-adviser responsible for a loyalty purge of the National Security Council (NSC), was in trademark venom-spitting mode as she accused Bondi of “incompetence”.\n\n“@AGPamBondi should resign for lying to the American People,” tweeted Loomer Monday afternoon.\n\nThere’s no question: Trumpworld has lost the narrative on this one. But there’s a reason why: this is a beast (in part) of its own making.\n\nWhile Vance is now in the uncomfortable spot of defending his boss from speculation, he was once one of the cheerleaders of the conspiracy himself, and not just as a one-off: it was during his previous appearance on Von’s podcast that the vice president, then a U.S. senator, told his host: “we need to release the Epstein [client] list”.\n\nAnd on X, Vance was even more acerbic criticizing the Biden administration over the investigation. In late 2021, just months before he would go on to become the GOP nominee for Senate in Ohio, the Hillbilly Elegy writer retweeted a “Pizzagate” conspiracy theorist who has gone on to become a fixture inside Trumpworld, Jack Posobiec.\n\n“What possible interest would the U.S. government have in keeping Epstein’s clients secret? Oh...” tweeted the nation’s future vice president.\n\nIn a second, longer rant aimed at another one of MAGA’s favorite targets, he then added: “If you’re a journalist and you’re not asking questions about this case you should be ashamed of yourself. What purpose do you even serve? I’m sure there’s a middle class teenager somewhere who could use some harassing right now but maybe try to do your job once in a while.” \n\nThere’s two lessons to take here: one, that not even the MAGA-fied White House can wrangle a conspiracy once the right-wing latches on to it; and second, that Vance made a serious judgement error when, in October of 2024, one week and six days before Election Day, he was presented with the choice of whether or not to fan the flames of a conspiracy involving his own running mate. \n\nVance, then a U.S. senator, knew better. Instead of definitively confirming the supposed existence of the “Epstein Client List” — of which his team is now denying the existence — he could have refused to speculate. Or he could have taken the DoJ at its word, given how likely it was at the time that he’d be defending that word in the future. \n\nBut at the time, it was still a problem for Joe Biden’s Justice Department and Kamala Harris’s legacy as the “prosecutor in the White House”.\n\nNow, that lack of foresight is coming back to bite him.","summary":"Trumpworld is trying to put out the flames JD Vance was happy to fan before it was his job to be the authority on the matter, writes John Bowden","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/vance-epstein-tweets-trump-bondi-b2784393.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/24/6/08/Mideast-Wars-Trump-ixjt3d4v.jpeg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 23:34:59","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.268},{"id":339274092,"title":"EXCLUSIVE: Marc Elias-Led Group Guided Illinois on Anti-Trump Litigation, Documents Reveal","text":"FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL – A former Clinton election lawyer sought to team up with a key Democrat state attorney general to create litigation chaos in the early days of the Trump administration, documents obtained by The Daily Signal show.\n\nShortly after November’s presidential election, a legal organization led by anti-Trump Democrat super lawyer Marc Elias was advising the office of Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul about confronting the incoming Trump administration.\n\nSince President Donald Trump took office, Illinois has taken at least 13 civil actions against the administration on immigration policy, election rules, federal funding, and other matters. In most cases, the lawsuits were part of multistate actions by Democrat attorneys general. \n\nLast week, Raoul joined a coalition of 20 Democrat state attorneys general challenging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ decision to provide data to the Department of Homeland Security regarding illegal immigration. \n\nElias is the chairman of the nonprofit liberal group Democracy Forward. He is a former lawyer for the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign who helped instigate discredited theory that Trump’s campaign conspired with the Russian government to win the election. Elias’ law firm, the Elias Law Group, regularly sues states to oppose voter ID laws and other election integrity measures. He was also the former lawyer for the Democratic National Committee, Emily’s List, Priorities USA, and other prominent Democrat-leaning groups. \n\nThe Daily Signal obtained redacted correspondence between Raoul’s staff and Democracy Forward staff dating back to Nov. 21 through a public records request to the Illinois attorney general’s office. The attorney general’s office informed The Daily Signal in writing that more documents are forthcoming. While the initial tranche provided little detail, the documents demonstrate the state’s link with the left-leaning litigation group. \n\nJust weeks after Trump defeated Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris, an email from Carrie Y. Flaxman, senior legal adviser to Democracy Forward, said to Illinois Deputy Solicitor General Sarah Hunger, “Hi Sarah, Would you have a few minutes to connect sometime soon? Best, Carrie.”\n\nThe Daily Signal previously reported that records revealed Democrat attorneys general in multiple states were planning for litigation against the potential Trump administration by mid-2024, well before Election Day. \n\nTwo days after Trump took the oath of office, Karyn Bass Ehler, the assistant chief deputy attorney general for Illinois, sent an email to Aleshadye Getachew, senior counsel for Democracy Forward. The subject line was “Accepted: DF/Illinois AG re EO Strategy.”\n\nThe Illinois attorney general’s office, along with other states, gained an initial victory over the Trump administration on Jan. 31 in a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s federal funding freeze. Illinois teamed with a coalition of 22 state attorneys general. \n\nIn June, Raoul–along with 19 other Democrat state attorneys general–won a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration over illegal immigration conditions placed on federal transportation funding. \n\nLitigation also included an April lawsuit challenging Trump’s executive order on election integrity. Raoul was part of a 19-attorney general coalition. \n\nNeither the Illinois state attorney general’s press office nor Democracy Forward’s press office responded to requests for on-the-record comments for this story.","summary":"FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL – A former Clinton election lawyer sought to team up with a key Democrat state attorney general to create litigation...

We also know the media knows it’s a lie. But they seem, as always, not ready to meet the moment. Rather than reporting on how there has never been such a nakedly partisan email from the SSA, and how turning agency communications into partisan boasts filled with lies undermines democracy, they’re desperately trying to explain it away. \n\nAxios said it was “unusual for the agency to blast an overtly political message to its massive email list, which includes retirees and those who've signed up at their website.” \n\n“Unusual” implies that there is a usual course of action this slightly diverges from, but that it’s also not wholly outside of the bounds of appropriate government communication. In reality, it’s unheard of. It’s tiresome to do the “Imagine if President Joe Biden did this” thing, but honestly, imagine it. The media would lose their minds. It would be “But her emails” combined with “Joe Biden is senile” times 1,000. \n\nIt’s not that past presidents haven’t had agencies blast out press releases touting their achievements. Here’s one that Axios dug up from 2010, in its attempts to characterize the Trumpy announcement as similar to past presidential communications. In the old press release, the then-head of Social Security praised President Barack Obama’s “commitment to creating an unprecedented level of openness in government.” \n\nThat example doesn’t really help Axios, though. First, the Obama-era announcement was a press release, not something sent to 71 million people’s email inboxes indiscriminately. Second, the 2010 statement was not about the passage of a partisan tax law, but rather, it was about how SSA now had new datasets available for researchers. And finally, of course, that 2010 announcement was not based on a lie. \n\nQuite simply, the Big Beautiful Bill has no language in it whatsoever about eliminating federal income taxes on Social Security. In reality, the bill does give seniors an extra tax deduction—but only for four years, because the benefits should never last longer than Trump, only the tax cuts. But that deduction phases out based on income, and doesn’t apply to any Social Security recipients under 65, even though people are eligible to begin drawing Social Security at 62. \n\nAxios isn’t the only outlet that should come in for blame here. The New York Times said that the Social Security Administration had “circulated an imprecise email,” as if it were internal communications about a potluck and it accidentally said Peggy was bringing chips, but it’s actually Timmy. CNN characterized it as “stray[ing] from the agency’s typically apolitical nature.”\n\nTrump is now circulating his supposed evidence for how it gives everyone the tax break his email promised. That evidence is a scant little piece from Trump’s own Council of Economic Advisers. It’s dated as “June 2025” and comes in at 4 pages, including the title page. Rigorous analysis, this is not. But of course, it’s already getting reported as accurate.\n\nWhen it comes to Trump, the mainstream media is constantly engaged in this sort of sanewashing, trying to paint Trump as just a bit off-kilter, a little more inclined toward some unusual styles of communication. \n\nThey know as well as you do that the actions of the administration and the president are so out of pocket, so repulsive, so partisan that it should be on the front page of every paper in America. But since this is Donald Trump, not Hillary Clinton or Kamala Harris or Joe Biden, the media is going to keep giving him cover.","summary":"Over the weekend, 71 million people—anyone who has ever created an account on the Social Security Administration’s website—got an unhinged partisan email lying about how President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill “eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries.” It also floridly praised Trump for reaffirming his “promise to protect Social Security” and says that the newly signed law “helps ensure that seniors can better enjoy the retirement they’ve earned.”\n\n\n\nWe know that’s a lie.

The comment is revealed in the upcoming book 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America by Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager and Isaac Arnsdorf, according to the New York Post. Biden’s campaign was in freefall after the then-81-year-old president appeared tired and disoriented at the June 2024 presidential debate, his only debate against Trump. 'THE KAMALA EXCUSE': TENSIONS BETWEEN BIDEN AND HARRIS PLAGUED THEIR CAMPAIGNS, NEW BOOK REVEALS \"I really don’t know what he said at the end of that sentence, and I don’t think he knows what he said either,\" Trump remarked at one point. The June debate was held much earlier than presidential debates were traditionally held. According to the book, Biden’s aides persuaded him to hold the early debate, claiming doing so would allow him to act from a position of strength. \"By holding the first debate in the spring, YOU will be able to reach the widest audience possible, before we are deep in the summer months with the conventions, Olympics and family vacations taking precedence… In addition, the earlier YOU are able to debate the better, so that the American people can see YOU standing next to Trump and showing the strength of YOUR leadership, compared to Trump’s weakness and chaos,\" a campaign memo, published by Politico, reportedly said. BIDEN MADE HARRIS CAMPAIGN A 'NIGHTMARE,' DESTROYED HER CHANCES BY STAYING IN 2024 RACE TOO LONG, AIDES CHARGE Biden’s performance created worries in the Democratic establishment that he would lose the election, and the 45th president began facing calls to drop out of the race. On July 10, 2024, the New York Times published an op-ed by the actor George Clooney urging Biden to exit the race. More Democratic politicians began to follow suit until Biden ultimately dropped out of the race on July 21, 2024. Harris succeeded him in the race, mounting a truncated roughly three-month-long campaign that ultimately failed. Harris’ comments to the governors, made before Biden dropped out, were part of an effort to salvage his flailing candidacy. Following the meeting, New York Governor Kathy Hochul and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz appeared in the White House driveway to voice their support for the president. Numerous high-profile Democratic governors, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Illinois Gov. Gavin Pritzker Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – all of whom were touted as possible replacements for Biden – did not appear to vouch for Biden in public. Walz was later tapped to be Harris’ running mate when she stepped into the race.

In both cases, as there was no misconduct, there were no apologies offered and no admission of guilt, in an effort to protect their reputations by refusing contrition for their journalism. \n\nSimilarly, several law firms such as Paul Weiss, Skadden Arps, and Kirkland & Ellis were threatened by Trump to have access to federal buildings and government security clearances cancelled and their clients were threatened with commercial repercussions if they continued to do business with the firms. Some firms settled preempting a White House executive order. Given their clients’ needs for such access and their clients’ fiduciary duties to their shareholders, they made concessions in the way of offers of legal work that was already covered by the existing donated time and for causes these firms already long addressed. Thus, the concessions gave Trump an illusion of victory and a dignified path for retreat, truly winning nothing.

Beyonce, Lady Gaga, Oprah Winfrey or Bruce Springsteen were all eager to participate in the campaign’s efforts to enlist as many celebrities as possible to give speeches or to entertain on behalf of the former vice president.\n\nA new book looks at why Harris’ staff failed to get Swift to show up on the 2024 campaign trail, despite weeks of rumors and speculation that she would make an appearance, even on the eve of the election.\n\nThe authors, journalists Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager and Isaac Arnsdorf, said that staffers who worked on celebrity appearances “were instructed not to make any outreach” to Swift. Instead, that job would be left to Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff. He was put in charge of the Swift outreach because he had an “in” in the pop singer’s team.\n\n“Before Harris became vice president, Emhoff had had a lucrative career as an entertainment lawyer in Los Angeles,” the authors wrote, according to the Daily Mail. “He and Swift’s lawyer, Doug Baldridge, were both partners at the firm Venable.”\n\nEmhoff reached out to Baldridge to “convey that the campaign would appreciate any efforts the pop star could make to help Harris,” the authors wrote. But then came a “brutal,” seven-word reply, which would turn out to be a rejection, the Daily Mail said.\n\n“Swift would do what Swift thought best,” Baldridge said.\n\nUp to that point, the Harris campaign had reason to hope that Swift would do more. Following Harris’ debate performance, the singer surprised the campaign “with a full-throated endorsement posted on her Instagram,” the authors wrote. She memorably shared a photo of her with one of her three cats and signed it “Childless Cat Lady,” a dig at resurfaced 2021 comments made by J.D. Vance about Democrats and “miserable” “childless cat ladies.”\n\nIn her endorsement, Swift said she would vote for Harris and running mate Tim Walz because the former California senator and San Francisco district attorney “fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.” The mega-star also praised Harris as “a steady-handed, gifted leader” who would lead “with calm and not chaos.”\n\nThe Swift endorsement helped boost an already “electric” mood in the Harris campaign after the debate, the authors reported.\n\n“Harris asked if she should mention the endorsement when she spoke to supporters at a watch party,” the authors wrote. But staffers told her that “would sound too thirsty,” though they agreed to change her walk-off song at the event to Swift’s “The Man.”\n\nDays after Swift’s endorsement, Trump fumed on his Truth Social platform, declaring in all-caps, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!”\n\nAhead of the Democratic National Convention in August and the November election, this new book and others have reported that the Harris campaign “dedicated huge resources” to massive rallies with celebrity guests. After Joe Biden dropped out of the race and Harris became the Democratic candidate, the Oakland-reared former prosecutor began packing in crowds at rallies and dominating news cycles, including the celebrity/entertainment media. She was hailed as a “rock star” and “the coolest thing pop culture” as she fought Trump, another celebrity from his days as a reality TV star and a New York City tabloid figure.\n\nAuthors Dawsey, Pager and Arnsdorf wrote: “Harris and Walz said they were bringing joy back to politics, and massive celebrity-filled rallies — Meghan Thee Stallion performed in Atlanta, Maggie Rogers in Ann Arbor, Gracie Abrams and Mumford & Sons in Madison, Wisconsin — were key to that strategy.”\n\nBeyonce, who had been rumored to appear alongside Harris at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August, finally joined the candidate at an abortion rights rally in her hometown of Houston, Texas in October.\n\n“But privately, some campaign staff raised concerns that the major rallies may not be worth the millions of dollars they cost to stage or the staff investment,” the authors wrote. “There was scant evidence that the rallies were persuading voters or necessarily boosting turnout.”\n\nThere also were concerns about some of the celebrity assignments, according to the book. For example, the campaign sent Springsteen, whose fans are predominantly white, to Clarkston, Georgia, where the city’s population is 70% black and 50% foreign-born. “The predominantly white press corps seemed more interested in Springsteen’s performance than the 23,000 mostly black attendees,’ the authors said.\n\nIn the final hours before Election Day, there was some belief that Swift might finally make an appearance, according to the book. Harris was headed to Pennsylvania for some events and a final rally in Philadelphia, and “low-level Harris aides did nothing to tamp down the speculation” that Swift would join Harris there, in her home state. Instead, Lady Gaga was the main act for the final event, the book said.\n\nIt’s well-known that Swift has carefully curated her political activism, just as she curates her public image. She appears eager to limit her political statements to those which she believes will have maximum impact, usually non-partisan statements that encourage voter registration efforts. She first endorsed candidates in the 2018 election cycle, lending her support to Democrats running in races in Tennessee, her home state at the time. She endorsed Joe Biden on social media in 2020, then Harris in 2024.\n\nFollowing Trump’s stunning and decisive victory on Nov. 5, Harris’ celebrity supporters were left to articulate their grief and disbelief — or, like Swift, they stayed silent. As political pundits and cultural commentators said at the time, they were perhaps numbed by the realization that 77 million Americans — or close to 50% of voters — didn’t just reject their chosen candidate but helped to repudiate a belief in celebrities’ power to influence culture, politics and people’s voting choices.","summary":"A new book on the 2024 presidential campaign reveals the 'brutal,' seven-word response that Harris' team received from Swift's people.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/07/07/how-taylor-swift-snubbed-kamala-harris-on-the-campaign-trail/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Taylor_Swift-End_of_Eras_69178.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 19:59:25","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.048},{"id":339229722,"title":"CBS parent company sparks massive outrage with Trump lawsuit settlement","text":"Paramount Global and CBS’ eight-figure settlement to President Donald Trump has caused widespread outrage across the legal and journalism communities. \n\nParamount Global and CBS agreed on Tuesday to settle Trump’s $20 billion election interference lawsuit against the network. The lawsuit alleged CBS News deceitfully edited a “60 Minutes” interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris in order to make her appear more articulate ahead of Election Day. \n\nMany legal experts and Paramount’s own attorneys insisted the lawsuit was meritless, but CBS’ parent company settled it anyway. It is widely believed that Paramount’s controlling shareholder Shari Redstone pushed for the settlement in hopes of paving the way for Trump’s FCC to approve a long-planned merger with David Ellison’s Skydance Media.\n\nCBS staffers are furious and there has been extensive backlash from media watchdogs, journalism advocacy groups, liberal journalists and even Democratic lawmakers. \n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., issued a scathing statement that said the settlement sets an “extremely dangerous precedent in terms of both the First Amendment and government extortion,” while Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., accused Paramount of taking a “bribe” and threatened future federal charges. \n\nFormer CNN anchor Jim Acosta said Paramount “paid a shameful bribe to the President of the United States in order to grease the skids for a media deal that, and there really is no other way to put this, stinks to high heaven.” \n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union believes Paramount and CBS “disgraced themselves” with the decision. \n\n“President Trump’s lawsuit was frivolous. Paramount’s capitulation was craven. We’ve never been more in need of a free and independent press as a check on abuses of power. Instead, Paramount and CBS have disgraced themselves and betrayed the core values of journalism,” ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project director Ben Wizner said in a statement.\n\nThe Freedom of the Press Foundation called the settlement a “dark day” for press freedom. \n\n“Paramount’s spineless decision to settle Trump’s baseless and patently unconstitutional lawsuit is an insult to the journalists of ‘60 Minutes’ and an invitation to Trump to continue targeting other news outlets. Each time a company cowers and surrenders to Trump’s demands it only emboldens him to do it again,” FPF director of advocacy Seth Stern wrote. \n\n“It will be remembered as one of the most shameful capitulations by the press to a president in history,” Stern continued. “But we are not done fighting.”\n\nThe FPF is a Paramount Global shareholder, and Stern is ready to make his voice heard. \n\n“We’ve already filed a shareholder information demand and are sending a second demand today to uncover information about this decision. With that information, we will continue to pursue our legal options to stop this affront to Paramount shareholders, CBS journalists, and the First Amendment. Paramount directors should be held accountable and we will do all we can to make that happen,” Stern wrote. \n\nFamed First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams, who represented The New York Times during the Pentagon Papers case, told the FPF that Paramount’s decision to settle “is an ominous blow to press freedom in our nation.”\n\nThe Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), a First Amendment advocacy organization, isn’t pleased with CBS News’ parent company, either. \n\n“Paramount may have closed this case, but it opened the door to the idea that the government should be the media’s editor-in-chief. Trump has a long history of filing frivolous lawsuits to intimidate critics, and his targets have a long history of capitulating to avoid legal headaches. And here, he had the added tactic of using the FCC and its review of the multi-billion-dollar Paramount-Skydance merger to bring added pressure to bear,” FIRE Chief Counsel Bob Corn-Revere said. \n\n“Behavior that gets rewarded gets repeated,” Corn-Revere continued. “This settlement will only embolden the president to continue his flurry of baseless lawsuits against the press — and against the American people’s ability to hear the news free from government intrusion.”\n\nPEN America, a group that bills itself as standing “at the intersection of literature and human rights to protect free expression in the United States and worldwide,” suggested CBS isn’t protecting it’s journalists. \n\n“Paramount’s decision to settle a meritless lawsuit rather than stand behind its journalists at CBS News is a spineless capitulation,” PEN America director Tim Richardson said. \n\n“This was a moment to defend press freedom and support reporters targeted by a frivolous legal attack,” Richardson added. “Instead, Paramount chose appeasement to bolster its finances, sending a dangerous message that media outlets can be pressured into submission if corporate parents find their profits at risk from government action in unrelated areas.” \n\nRichardson noted ABC also settled a defamation lawsuit in December with then-President-elect Trump for $15 million, after anchor George Stephanopoulos repeatedly and incorrectly asserted Trump had been found “liable for rape” in a civil trial last year. ABC additionally paid $1 million for President Trump’s legal fees. \n\n“With two major network owners bowing to the president in quick succession, the danger is clear: emboldened politicians and powerful actors will feel more free than ever to weaponize lawsuits and bring regulatory pressure to bear to silence and censor independent journalism,” Richardson said. \n\nHeritage Foundation Media Fellow Tim Young sees it differently and is “glad” they settled but doesn’t feel it will change the way news organizations cover Trump and other public figures they don’t align with. \n\n“This is one of the few times the media has been held accountable. They definitely wouldn’t have settled had Trump not won the election, because Kamala, who they lied to make look good, would have protected them,” Young told Fox News Digital. \n\n“I’d love to believe that this is a turning point in media accountability, but it won’t be,” Young continued. “When you see the dramatic differences in coverage and continuous lies, legacy media networks are showing that they will continue this dishonest behavior.”\n\nParamount has defended the settlement. \n\n“Companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable costs of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial or reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause. Settlement offers a negotiated resolution that allows companies to focus on their core objectives rather than being mired in uncertainty and distraction,” a Paramount spokesperson told Fox News Digital. \n\nFox News Digital has learned that the sum being paid to Trump could reach north of $30 million, with $16 million being paid upfront for his future presidential library, in addition to another eight-figure allocation set aside for advertisements, public service announcements, or other similar transmissions, in support of conservative causes by the network in the future. \n\nCurrent Paramount management disputes the additional allocation, and a source familiar with Paramount’s current leadership told Fox New Digital only $16 million was sanctioned by the official mediator, and they have no knowledge of any deal Trump made with incoming owner, Skydance Media. However, the incoming ownership will be responsible for the additional allocation. \n\nRedstone recused herself from settlement negotiations in February. \n\nAs part of the agreement, CBS News did not admit to any wrongdoing nor issue an apology. The network did agree to update its editorial standards by mandating the release of full, unedited transcripts of interviews with future presidential candidates.\n\nTrump’s legal team took a victory lap after the settlement was announced. \n\n“With this record settlement, President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit. CBS and Paramount Global realized the strength of this historic case and had no choice but to settle. President Trump will always ensure that no one gets away with lying to the American People as he continues on his singular mission to Make America Great Again,” a spokesperson for Trump’s legal team told Fox News Digital.","summary":"CBS staffers are furious and there has been extensive backlash from media watchdogs, journalism advocacy groups, liberal journalists and even Democratic lawmakers. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/07/media/cbs-parent-company-sparks-massive-outrage-with-trump-lawsuit-settlement/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/107766550.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 19:25:05","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.111},{"id":339265746,"title":"Donald Trump Wants to Spoil Elon Musk's New Party","text":"“I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely ‘off the rails,’” Trump added later in a lengthy post on his social media platform Sunday night, “essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks.”\nThe pair have been feuding for more than a month now over Trump’s signature megabill, which he signed into law last week. Musk had been critical of the legislation, using the social media platform he owns to lobby against what he described as the “DEBT SLAVERY bill”—and to launch more personal broadsides against the president, most notably in his references to his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Trump, meanwhile, has dismissed Musk’s criticisms as self-serving—“Unfortunately for Elon,” Trump wrote Sunday night, the megabill “eliminates the ridiculous Electric Vehicle (EV) Mandate”—and threatened to cancel government contracts and even look into having Musk deported.\nMusk, in response, posted an X poll on the Fourth of July, asking his followers if they would like “independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system.” “By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it!” he wrote the next day. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”\nMusk offered little detail about the party’s platform, aside from some of his typically grandiose promises. (“The way we’re going to crack the uniparty system is by using a variant of how Epaminondas shattered the myth of Spartan invincibility at Leuctra,” he wrote in one of many posts on the matter.) But the announcement attracted some support—including from billionaire businessman Mark Cuban, who campaigned for Kamala Harris last year—and jabs from Trumpworld. Steve Bannon called Musk a “buffoon” on his War Room podcast, a “non-American starting an America Party.”\nScott Bessent, Trump’s Treasury secretary, pointedly suggested on CNN Sunday that the boards of directors at his companies may not “like this announcement…and will be encouraging him to focus on his business activities, not his political activities.” (One Tesla true-believer told Vanity Fair last month that Musk's political activities had been “pretty dark for the Tesla story,” and, indeed, Tesla stock plunged further Monday, reflecting investor worries about yet another unpopular political venture from Musk.) And then there was Trump himself, accusing Musk of conspiring to sow “Complete and Total DISRUPTION & CHAOS” with his new party.\n“i ain’t reading all that. i’m happy for you tho or sorry that happened,” Musk wrote in response.\nMusk seems keen to sell his new party as the “centrist” antidote for our ailing civic life. But he is, of course, part of the affliction—contrary to what the gullible and grifty who have cheered on the America Party might have you believe.","summary":"In the latest round of online sniping, the president said his former top adviser was a \"TRAIN WRECK\" who went “off the rails.”","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/donald-trump-wants-to-spoil-elon-musks-new-party","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/686c055c376259ca2f99b2d1/16:9/w_7728,h_4347,c_limit/2185933741","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 18:56:24","author":"Eric Lutz","authors":["Eric Lutz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":339225664,"title":"CBS News Legend Lowell Bergman Explains Why Paramount’s Trump Settlement Is ‘A Lot Worse’ Than His Big Tobacco Case","text":"Longtime “60 Minutes” producer Lowell Bergman said Paramount’s $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump is “a lot worse” than the similar situation CBS News found itself in over proposed coverage of the tobacco industry in the 1990s.\n\n“We’re in a really grim moment, when absurd lawsuits and huge amounts of money come together to damage the public interest,” Bergman told The New York Times’ “The Daily” podcast on Monday.\n\nBergman said he believed Trump’s lawsuit against Paramount was “even weaker” than the lawsuit the president filed against ABC and George Stephanopoulos, which was settled for $15 million late last year.\n\nStephanopoulos had said on air several times that Trump was found “liable for rape” in the civil case E. Jean Carroll brought against him. In fact, Trump was found liable for sexual abuse, which carries a different definition in New York, where the case took place.\n\n“A reasonable jury could interpret Stephanopoulos’ statements as defamatory,” Magistrate Judge Reid wrote last year. “Stephanopoulos stated 10 times that a jury — or juries — had found plaintiff liable for rape.”\n\nThe judge’s comments, coupled with the fear a Florida jury would award Trump more than the $15 million he ultimately received, pushed Disney towards settling.\n\nOn Monday, Bergman said ABC “capitulated” to Trump — and Paramount followed suit last week with its own settlement. \n\n“Every legal expert thought it was sort of nonsense, right? It’s nonsense,” Bergman said about Trump’s lawsuit against Paramount. “It’s done to intimidate, and so the result will be that you have litigation, and it becomes all-consuming when you’re in the middle of it.”\n\nTrump initially sued Paramount for $20 billion over how “60 Minutes” edited an interview with Kamala Harris last year, arguing it was “false advertising” and election tampering. The president’s lawyers later argued the segment caused him “mental anguish.”\n\nA settlement was reached last week, with the payment including “plaintiffs’ fees and costs” as well as a donation that will be allocated to a “future presidential library.” Paramount also said that “in the future, ’60 Minutes’ will release transcripts of interviews with eligible U.S. presidential candidates after such interviews have aired, subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns.”\n\nBergman added he believed the settlement is a bigger smear on CBS’ legacy than when the network’s lawyers blocked a “60 Minutes” interview with Jeffrey Wigand, a whistleblower from Brown & Williamson tobacco company. The interview ultimately ran months later, after the Wall Street Journal reported on Wigand’s allegations against the tobacco industry — all of which eventually served as the drama for Michael Mann’s 1999 political thriller “The Insider,” which featured Al Pacino playing Bergman.\n\n“It’s not like a case involving tobacco and the pressure that was coming down was easy to see where it would be coming from,” Bergman said. “This is the president of the United States, and this is without precedent in the history of this country.”\n\nBergman added journalists have to be a “little bit depressed” about what the future holds for the profession. \n\n“The fact is, that anyone working at ’60 Minutes’ from now on has to worry about what is going to be allowed on the air,” Bergman said.\n\nListen to Bergman’s full interview on “The Daily” here.","summary":"The veteran producer and subject of Michael Mann's \"The Insider\" starring Al Pacino says it is a \"grim moment\" for journalists\n\n\nThe post CBS News Legend Lowell Bergman Explains Why Paramount&#8217;s Trump Settlement Is &#8216;A Lot Worse&#8217; Than His Big Tobacco Case appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/lowell-bergman-paramount-trump-settlement-the-daily/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trump_stocks.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 18:43:53","author":"Sean Burch","authors":["Sean Burch"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.141},{"id":339225100,"title":"The Past Four Years at the Supreme Court Did Not Need to Be This Way","text":"On Oct. 26, 2020, the Senate confirmed Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. Eight days later, voters rejected the president who nominated her by some 7 million votes, but the election results could not undo what President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had already done. When Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the six members of the court’s newly minted conservative supermajority were the most powerful Republican politicians in the country, primed to spend four years standing in the way of anything and everything Democrats might have aspired to accomplish.\n\nBarrett and company wasted little time getting to work. They functionally overturned Roe v. Wade on the shadow docket in December 2021, and finished the job six months later in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. They outlawed affirmative action, and torpedoed Biden’s student debt relief plan, and reserved for themselves the power to second-guess federal regulations they don’t like. They transformed the First Amendment into a guarantee of Christian supremacy, and rewrote the Second Amendment to put more guns in more hands in a nation where people already can’t stop killing each other. And in 2024, they announced a sweeping theory of executive immunity in order to insulate their party’s candidate from criminal prosecution, clearing the way for him to run for president again and win.\n\nLate last month, the court wrapped its 2024–25 term by handing Trump yet another jurisprudential gift: a 6–3 decision that limits judges’ ability to temporarily block policies from taking effect while legal challenges wind their way through the court system. The result in Trump v. CASA, which rolled back a trio of injunctions that had paused Trump’s executive order purporting to revoke the 14th Amendment’s unambiguous promise of birthright citizenship, transformed a constitutional right into a privilege contingent on where children of nonpermanent residents happen to be born, and when.\n\nPresidents of both parties have long complained about the proliferation of these so-called “universal” injunctions. Curiously, this court decided to intervene only when Donald Trump and Stephen Miller asserted the legal authority to render babies stateless.\n\nGiven how frequently the court let these sorts of injunctions stymie Biden’s agenda, it’s worth recalling now a simple fact that has been lost in the disaster that was the end of this Supreme Court term: The past four years did not have to go this poorly. In 2021, Democrats held the White House and majorities in both chambers of Congress. (Their Senate majority—50–50, plus Vice President Kamala Harris’ tiebreaking vote—was as narrow as majorities get, but a majority nonetheless.) This unified Democratic government could have used its fleeting power to add seats to the Supreme Court, thus restoring some semblance of balance to what everyone knew was the most conservative court in living memory. They did not do so, thanks to a time-honored Washington combination of obstinance, reticence, and cowardice.\n\nAs the court’s latest round of decisions shows, Democrats’ failure to act was a catastrophic mistake. If they are lucky enough to get another chance, they cannot make it again.\n\nThe circumstances of Barrett’s confirmation—the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and the breakneck pace of Trump and McConnell’s efforts to replace her before the election—generated a real burst of interest in court expansion, particularly given the hypocrisy of this effort in the wake of McConnell’s nearly yearlong blockade of Merrick Garland’s nomination to fill the Supreme Court seat of Justice Antonin Scalia during the final months of Barack Obama’s presidency. As lawmakers considered Barrett’s nomination, one poll showed that a slim majority of Americans supported adding seats to the court. On the campaign trail, Biden said he was “not a fan” of expansion, but promised to take a hard look at reforming an institution that was, in his words, “getting out of whack.”\n\nBiden ostensibly made good on this commitment in April 2021, when he convened a blue-ribbon commission to analyze the “principal arguments … for and against Supreme Court reform.” But the commission conspicuously included zero prominent supporters of expansion, and felt like a body carefully assembled to draw a conclusion likely to reflect the president’s existing preferences. Sure enough, in its report, the commission noted the existence of “considerable, bipartisan support” for term limits for the justices, but cited concerns that expansion could “undermine or destroy the Supreme Court’s legitimacy.”\n\nFor the most part, Democrats followed the Biden commission’s lead. A Senate bill to add four seats to the court picked up a total of three (3) Democratic supporters. Biden maintained his opposition, as did the Senate Democratic Caucus’ most obnoxious future lobbyists. After Republicans won the House in the 2022 midterms, Democrats had little to say about structural court reform until July 2024, when Biden announced his support for term limits. This probably would have felt more meaningful had he not dropped his bid for reelection eight days earlier.\n\nThe point here is not to helicopter-dunk on razor-thin Democratic majorities from two Congresses ago for failing to enact what was, in light of their personnel at the time, admittedly a long-shot reform proposal. The point is that such a proposal can’t be a long shot in the future. Democrats who are dissatisfied with the past four years of the Supreme Court’s handiwork need to learn from their mistakes—to start building popular support for court reform now, so that they can act decisively if and when they are next in power. Convening another presidential commission to reexamine the pros and cons is not going to cut it.\n\nMany Democrats couch their opposition to expansion as a matter of prudent governance. “I’m skeptical of it because I don’t know where it stops,” said Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, in April 2021. Kicking off a never-ending series of tit-for-tat additions, he continued, could yield a “100-person Supreme Court that changes every four years.” The Biden commission similarly warned that retaliatory expansion cycles could eventually cause the public to view the court as a “political football,” and “a pawn in a continuing partisan game.” (Imagine that.)\n\nIn my view, speculative fears have never constituted a persuasive argument for, say, allowing Sam Alito to put Moms for Liberty chapters in charge of public school curriculum. But in 2025, this concern is as quaint as it is unpersuasive. Polling shows that most Americans do not perceive the court as “politically neutral,” and believe its decisions are motivated “mainly by politics.” By expanding the court, Democrats would simply acknowledge a reality that voters already understand: Interpreting the law is inherently political, and so long as Democrats have fewer justices in the fight, they are going to keep losing decisively.\n\nSkittish Democrats also need to weigh the risks of taking action against the hard realities of their decision to stand pat. If the party had expanded the court in 2021, Roe v. Wade would still be good law. Lawmakers could do more to protect their constituents from gun violence. Affirmative action would be legal, voting rights would be stronger, millions of borrowers would carry less debt, and Trump would not be magically immune from prosecution for fomenting a deadly riot at the Capitol. Even if Trump and his Republican House and Senate majorities were now racing to pass an expansion bill of their own, there are people who are dead who would still be alive today if Alito’s triumphant majority opinion in Dobbs were instead a furious dissent.\n\nIt is true that court expansion does not poll as well as it did five years ago. But being a politician occasionally requires actual leadership, which means working to persuade voters of the merits of a position, rather than reflexively hewing to public opinion at any given moment. In the meantime, the court has provided plenty of fodder for Democrats interested in reopening the debate: Before Trump took office, the court’s approval rating hovered in the 40s, and often dipped when the justices made headlines for one ignominious reason or another. After Dobbs, for example, the court’s approval rating plunged to 38 percent in one poll, down from 66 percent two years earlier. If recent history is any indication, Democrats do not have to do much to make the court a villain, because the court is very adept at doing that all by itself.\n\nPart of the reason court reform failed in 2021 is the fact that Democrats were unprepared for Ginsburg’s spectacularly ill-timed death to yield a six-justice conservative supermajority within six weeks. There is no excuse for getting caught flat-footed again. Democratic politicians need to start laying the groundwork for court reform now, by making the case to voters that the current court poses an existential threat to everything they care about. Again, this should not be especially difficult: A study published in 2024 estimated that without expansion, Republicans would maintain control of the Court until 2065. If you are a Democrat who understands what four straight decades of Barrett majority opinions would look like, and you are still too afraid to challenge the status quo, why are you in politics in the first place?","summary":"Part of the reason court reform failed in 2021 is that Democrats were unprepared for Ginsburg’s spectacularly ill-timed death.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/07/supreme-court-term-end-analysis-chuck-schumer.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/b6ef86f4-237f-4bf4-a5ae-0c9644e60546.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 18:12:20","author":"Jay Willis","authors":["Jay Willis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.367},{"id":339229184,"title":"Mark Ruffalo Slams Joe Rogan Over Response to ICE Immigration Raids: “It’s a Little Late Now”","text":"Mark Ruffalo is calling out podcaster and prominent Trump supporter Joe Rogan for being late to the game in his criticism of ICE immigration raids.\n\n“Dear @joerogan.

There are currently three vacancies in the chamber due to three Democrats having died in office. \n\nBacon, who has represented Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District since 2017, announced June 30 that he would not be running for reelection in 2026. The congressman’s district includes Omaha, the Democrats’ blue bastion in an otherwise red state, and is seen by some Democrats as a pickup prospect to help them reclaim the House majority in the 2026 midterms. \n\nOmaha ousted its Republican three-term incumbent Mayor Jean Stothert in favor of Democrat John Ewing Jr., the Douglas County treasurer, in May. \n\nThe Cook Political Report has moved the district into the “Lean Democrat” category from its prior “Toss Up” designation after Bacon’s retirement announcement. His district was won at the presidential level by Joe Biden in 2020 and Kamala Harris in 2024. \n\nSeveral Democrats have already announced bids to replace the five-term lawmaker. They include Denise Powell, a self-described small business owner and public school champion, and Nebraska state Sen. John Cavanaugh.\n\nBacon, who is a retired Air Force brigadier general, cited spending more time with his family as the reason for leaving Congress.\n\n“After three decades in the Air Force and now going on one decade in Congress, I look forward to coming home in the evenings and being with my wife and seeing more of our adult children and eight grandchildren, who all live near my home,” Bacon said in a statement. \n\nWhile the Nebraska congressman put his family front and center of his rationale for leaving federal legislative office, it was no secret that Bacon, who is seen as a moderate Republican, had a sometimes contentious relationship with President Donald Trump.\n\nIn April, Bacon sponsored legislation to end President Donald Trump’s tariffs after 60 days unless the president received approval from Congress. That prompted the president to allude to him as a “rebel Republican.”\n\nBacon also crossed party lines to vote to codify same-sex marriage into federal law and in 2018 sponsored legislation to increase the punishments for straw gun purchases; that is, buying firearms on behalf of others. \n\n“I have a love for national security, and I’ll always be a proponent for old-fashioned Ronald Reagan conservative values. It has been an honor to serve the 2nd District of Nebraska and the nation, and I thank our constituents for trusting me to represent them,” Bacon said in his retirement announcement.","summary":"Congressional Republicans have lost a strong contender to help them retain their majority in the House of Representatives with the announcement of the retirement of...

Democratic lawmakers and free press advocates have already promised congressional hearings, criminal probes and civil lawsuits on behalf of shareholders.\n\nParamount executives had expressed concerns for months that any large settlement could place the company’s board in legal peril for violating anti-bribery statutes, especially as chairwoman Shari Redstone – who was a driving force behind the settlement – looks to clear $2 billion with the merger.\n\nSpeaking to reporters early Friday morning following a speech at an Iowa rally, Trump was asked about the recent settlement with Paramount and CBS – and he effectively confirmed Gasparino’s reporting.\n\n“We did a deal for about $16 million plus $16 million, or maybe more than that, in advertising... It's like $32 to maybe $35 million,” the president boasted.\n\nTrump also heaped praise on both Eillsons, gushing over his “friend” Larry. “I think he’s going to run CBS really well, and I think he’s making a good deal to buy it. I think he’s great,” the president declared to the press pool before adding about David: “He's got a son who’s a fantastic young man too.”\n\nAt the same time, he insisted – much like Paramount and his hand-picked Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendan Carr, who will have final say on approving the merger – that the lawsuit settlement was completely unrelated to Skydance’s pending acquisition of Paramount.\n\nMeanwhile, a week before the settlement was announced, it was reported that David Ellison was bragging to his Hollywood friends that the lawsuit would be settled soon and struck an upbeat tone about the negotiations.\n\nDespite the president’s claim over the weekend, there are still some conflicting accounts about the handshake deal with the younger Ellison and whether it will be honored.\n\n“The president’s claim that the settlement is worth anything more than the announced $16 million figure is false, according to a source familiar with the situation,” Variety reported. “Neither Paramount nor Skydance Media has agreed to grant free advertising airtime to Trump, the source said.”\n\nRepresentatives for Skydance Media did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nStill, whether CBS will be running millions of dollars of pro-Trump ads or not after Skydance takes over, the fear within the newsroom – which has been roiled in turmoil for months over the Trump litigation and Paramount’s surrender to the president – over the new corporate ownership is palpable.\n\n“There is great fear about what comes next,” one CBS News staffer told CNN, a sentiment that was shared by network employees with The Independent.","summary":"‘We did a deal for about $16 million plus $16 million, or maybe more than that, in advertising...

Bergman, a longtime producer for CBS’ \"60 Minutes\" whose investigation of the tobacco industry was dramatized in the 1999 movie, \"The Insider,\" appeared on \"The Daily\" New York Times podcast to offer his take on Paramount Global and CBS settling with Trump. Bergman was played by Al Pacino in the film, which was based on the true story of CBS legal counsel attempting to shut down his tobacco industry report to appease corporate interests. Bergman said last week’s decision by Paramount to settle Trump’s \"election interference\" lawsuit makes current CBS issues even worse. CBS STAFFERS REVOLT OVER PARAMOUNT'S 'SHAMEFUL' TRUMP SETTLEMENT, 'BETRAYAL' TO THE NETWORK'S JOURNALISTS \"It’s nonsense, it’s done to intimidate,\" Bergman said of Trump’s $20 billion election interference lawsuit against the network. The lawsuit alleged CBS News deceitfully edited a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris in order to make her appear more articulate ahead of Election Day. Many legal experts and Paramount’s own attorneys insisted the lawsuit was meritless, but CBS’ parent company settled it anyway. Paramount's controlling shareholder Shari Redstone reportedly pushed for the settlement in hopes of paving the way for Trump’s FCC to approve a long-planned, lucrative merger with David Ellison’s Skydance Media. \"It’s not like a case involving tobacco, and the pressure that was coming down... this is the President of the United States, this is without precedent in the history of this country,\" Bergman told \"The Daily.\" Bergman said the settlement was explained by Paramount Global and CBS in a way to make it appear like a \"minor thing,\" when he believes it could actually have major ramifications. \"Anyone working at ’60 Minutes’ from now on has to worry about what is going to be allowed on the air, at a level that is, how should I put it?

PARAMOUNT, CBS FORCED TO PAY EIGHT FIGURES, CHANGE EDITORIAL POLICY IN SETTLEMENT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP Bergman is hopeful \"60 Minutes\" can regain credibility but feels producers and journalists could be hesitant to cause any controversy. \"And if the new owners who are coming in, who are going to buy, do not have a long tradition of being in the news business or being respectful of the traditions that it represents, we’re at a really grim moment when absurd lawsuits and huge amounts of money come together to damage the public interest,\" Bergman said. \"So, I would say,\" he continued. \"You gotta be a little bit depressed about what the future holds.\" Fox News Digital has learned that the sum being paid to Trump could reach north of $30 million, with $16 million being paid upfront for his future presidential library, in addition to another eight-figure allocation set aside for advertisements, public service announcements or other similar transmissions, in support of conservative causes by the network in the future.

Specifically, the book cites a Biden donor who pressed the White House in May 2024 to find a reason to pull Biden from the debates, after the donor reported being \"alarmed\" by Biden’s behavior at a Chicago fundraiser. Meanwhile, the Trump White House said the debate backfired on Biden, and instead, shed light on Biden's own weaknesses. \"The only highlight from the debate was Joe Biden’s inability (to) form a complete sentence,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a Monday statement to Fox News Digital. \"American voters got a firsthand look at Biden’s weakness, his campaign in chaos, and what it looks like when real leader is missing from the White House.\" \"Unfortunately for the Democrats, no adviser or so-called ‘strategic’ move could save their incompetent candidates and terrible policies from President Trump’s historic, landslide victory,\" Rogers said.

So it’s like $32 [million] to maybe $35 million.”\n\nSources close to the deal told Gasparino: “There is an anticipation of a mid-eight-figure sum that will be allocated by the network to PSA advertisements and other broadcast transmissions that support conservative causes supported by President Trump.”\n\nParamount has firmly denied this characterization.\n\nIn a statement issued last Wednesday, the company said: “Contrary to some news reports or media speculation, Paramount’s settlement with President Trump does not include PSAs or anything related to PSAs.”\n\n“Paramount has no knowledge of any promises or commitments made to President Trump other than those set forth in the settlement proposed by the mediator and accepted by the parties.”\n\nA Paramount spokesperson referred The Post to its previous statement. \n\nThe Post has sought comment from Skydance.\n\nParamount confirmed that the $16 million settlement covers a payment to Trump’s future presidential library and legal fees, and that “60 Minutes” will release interview transcripts with presidential candidates after they have aired.

The network eventually released full transcripts and video to the FCC.\n\nHigh-level negotiations surrounding the settlement played out over several months and included two senior CBS News executives parting ways with the company.\n\nParamount first offered a $15 million settlement in May, in line with other legal payouts made by media companies in cases involving Trump. But Trump initially demanded over $100 million and later reduced his ask to around $50 million, according to people familiar with the talks.\n\nParamount executives, wary of facing Democrat-led investigations into possible bribery charges, consulted legal counsel from Gibson Dunn as they weighed a final deal, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBehind the scenes, pressure to settle was mounting.

Swirling in Wake of Sean 'Diddy' Combs Trial — That Have Left A-Listers Petrified They Will Still Be Dragged Into Scandal","text":"In the aftermath of Sean 'Diddy' Combs' federal trial, a wave of conspiracy theories continues to ripple across the world – drawing in a growing list of celebrities, politicians and even deceased public figures. \n\nWhile Combs was acquitted last week on the most serious charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, speculation around his alleged misconduct shows little sign of fading, and RadarOnline.com has the details on all the wildest mysteries shrouding one of the biggest showbiz trials in history.\n\nAnd we can reveal how they are leaving a string of A-listers quaking.Crazed TheoriesDespite his conviction on two lesser charges of transporting women for prostitution – which he denies – the Internet has exploded with viral claims extending far beyond the courtroom. \n\nMany of the theories are unverified or outright false, yet they have left a number of high-profile individuals attempting to distance themselves from Combs' sex scandal altogether.\n\nAmong the most persistent claims is one involving a resurfaced video of Justin Bieber aged 15, in which Combs refers to spending \"48 hours\" with the young star and hints they're doing things they \"can't really disclose.\" \n\nThe video, though years old, has triggered renewed suspicion online. \n\nBieber's team has since clarified that while he was not harmed, saying: \"There are individuals who were genuinely hurt by him (Combs.)\"\n\nOthers have sought to tie the case to the deaths of singer Prince and Kim Porter, Combs' former partner and the mother of three of his children. \n\nOne now-viral claim suggests Prince recorded a confession implicating Combs in alleged crimes – a claim for which no evidence has been presented.Light VerdictA separate controversy erupted after an anonymous author published a fabricated memoir, Kim’s Lost Words, which was promoted as a tell-all from beyond the grave. \n\nThe book reached the top of Amazon's bestseller list before being pulled from sale under pressure from Porter's family and legal representatives.\n\nRumors have also engulfed Combs' Holmby Hills estate, which survived a series of wildfires that swept through parts of Los Angeles earlier this year. \n\nTheories circulated online suggesting that Combs' mansion had been spared due to its alleged connection to a network of underground tunnels used to transport individuals or conceal evidence – a claim former government official Catherine Austin Fitts echoed on her podcast. \n\nFitts implied homes destroyed in the fires were linked to Combs through \"incriminating\" ties – again, without substantiating evidence.\n\nThe reach of the conspiracies has extended into the political realm. \n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris, who appeared at a 2019 town hall hosted by Combs, found herself caught in the crossfire of online speculation.Running ScaredHer campaign's resurfaced tweet thanking Combs for his support was reposted by right-wing accounts implying deeper ties, prompting false suggestions that she had attended one of his infamous parties. \n\nDonald Trump shared a manipulated image of Harris and Combs on Truth Social, alongside the caption: \"Madam vice president, have you ever been involved with or engaged in one of Puff Daddy's 'Freak-Offs?'\"\n\nThe music industry has not been spared either. \n\nJay-Z and Beyoncé were linked to Combs in an interview by singer Jaguar Wright on Piers Morgan Uncensored, where Wright alleged – without evidence – all three were involved in a criminal network. \n\nFollowing legal pressure, Morgan issued an on-air apology, stating the claims were \"completely false.\"\n\nEven former President Barack Obama has been dragged into the conspiracy web. \n\nA 2004 video of Combs interviewing Obama during the Democratic National Convention has resurfaced, with conservative commentators – including Charlie Kirk – speculating that the rapper may possess compromising footage of the former president. No such material has emerged, and there is no indication of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe falsehoods have grown darker and more disturbing.Will Smith Horror StoryA widely circulated hoax on X accused actor Will Smith of \"selling\" his daughter Willow, now 23, to Combs in her youth – citing a photoshopped image and links to fictional videos that do not exist.\n\nDespite repeated denials and lack of corroboration, the conspiracy theories have had real-world consequences. \n\nSeveral celebrities named in posts have reportedly increased their private security, scrubbed their social media histories – or issued quiet legal warnings to platforms and publishers.\n\nWhile Combs has called the swirling claims \"lies on lies,\" and legal proceedings against him are on hold for now, the broader scandal shows no sign of fading. \n\nA source told us: \"For many A-listers, the fear isn't of guilt – but of being next in the digital crosshairs.\"\n\nAfter eight weeks of trial and 34 witnesses, Combs was found guilty of transportation for prostitution of ex-girlfriends Cassie Ventura and a female known as Jane, but not guilty on the more serious charges on racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.\n\nIt means he's gotten off the charges that could have seen him face 15 years to life behind bars.\n\nAfter being denied bail, he is now banged up until October to await sentencing, but legal sources say he could do very little or no more jail time.","summary":"Radar reveals the wildest conspiracy theories still shrouding the Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial – which are leaving a string of A-listers petrified.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/craziest-conspiracy-theories-sean-diddy-combs-trial-a-listers-petrified-dragged-into-scandal/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/7ZNd9oEay/0x0/craziest-conspiracy-theories-sean-diddy-combs-trial-a-listers-petrified-dragged-into-scandal-pp-1751651702467.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 15:40:44","author":"Matthew Acton","authors":["Matthew Acton"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.021},{"id":339164444,"title":"Read the Infamous Memo That Urged Biden to Debate Trump Early","text":"What was meant to be Joe Biden's defining moment in the 2024 campaign — an early debate to secure a second term by addressing concerns about his age and showing strength against Donald Trump — instead became a turning point that accelerated his political decline and led to his political nemesis' comeback.The risky strategy pushed by his senior advisers was largely to blame.A six-page internal memo dated April 15, 2024, and titled Recommendation for YOUR Participation in Debates shows how carefully the campaign orchestrated the plan. The memo, obtained by journalists Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager and Isaac Arnsdorf, features in their new book 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, which comes out Tuesday.The full memorandum, first published by Politico, argued that waiting for the traditional fall debate schedule would be too late. It recommended that Biden debate Trump \"as early as possible\" to reach voters before early ballots were cast in key states and before the race became mired in summer conventions and the Paris Olympics.\"Strategically holding these debates in the fall after many of the battleground states have already begun their early voting process and voter registration deadlines have passed is too late,\" the memo states, recommending two debates: the first in late June and a second in early September.The memo claimed that appearing alongside Trump early would allow Biden \"to reach the widest audience possible ... and stand next to Trump showing the strength of YOUR leadership compared to Trump's weakness and chaos.\"It also recommended months of informal press Q&As, a taped campaign town hall in April and at least five days of intensive mock debates at Camp David. The memo noted that holding the first debate in June would give the campaign time to recover if the night went badly.A Gamble That BackfiredThe optimism with which Biden's advisers approached the debate and their confidence that he still had the advantage to beat Trump has been dubbed one of the biggest miscalculations in modern American politics.While some inside the campaign questioned whether the gamble was worth it, senior advisers pushed forward convinced that an early debate could silence doubts about Biden's fitness and shift the race in his favor. Instead it intensified concerns about his fitness and sparked calls for him to step aside. He eventually did so weeks later, foreclosing the possibility of an ad hoc mini-primary that could have surfaced candidates to lead the ticket other than his vice president, Kamala Harris.According to Original Sin, by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, some aides worried Biden would struggle that night. Ron Klain argued forcefully \"he has to debate\" while Anita Dunn and Steve Ricchetti initially opposed the idea seeing little upside in sharing a stage with Trump, according to the book. Dunn reversed her position after Special Counsel Robert Hur's report raised questions about Biden's memory. Jen O'Malley Dillon pushed hardest for a June debate believing it was essential to make the election a choice rather than a referendum.Even during preparations at Camp David the flaws in the strategy became evident. Biden arrived \"rusty and exhausted,\" slept through his first day and required frequent naps. His answers during practice sessions were described as halting, rambling and inconsistent.One adviser admitted the team had lowered its expectations as his performance declined. \"It's true we were grading him on a curve every day,\" the aide said. \"Things that would have been considered a disaster in 2023 — by 2024 we would have said, 'Okay, we got through that.'\"Despite weeks of preparation, the June 27 debate in Atlanta quickly unraveled from the moment the then-president arrived on stage. Biden's delivery was weak, his answers scattered and his presence onstage failed to ease voter concerns. The very images his advisers had hoped would demonstrate strength — standing confidently next to Trump — instead reinforced doubts about his fitness.Speaking to Newsweek after the debate, Carl Cavalli, a professor of political science at the University of North Georgia, said Trump \"looked and sounded better\" than Biden and that impression would stick. \"I would not be surprised to see Trump take a clear lead in the polls in the coming days,\" Cavalli said. \"Not a huge lead but more than the back-and-forth we've seen.\"Indeed, he did.The debate performance intensified scrutiny of Biden's age and cognitive abilities. At the time, the White House originally said that Biden, then 81, had a cold. That explanation failed to stop what became a cascade of prominent Democrats and donors voicing concerns and eventually calling on the president to drop out. On July 10, actor and Democratic donor George Clooney published a New York Times op-ed urging Biden to step aside, a flashpoint that was widely seen as the beginning of the end of his reelection chances.\"The one battle he cannot win is the fight against time,\" Clooney wrote.The pressure culminated 11 days later, when Biden announced his withdrawal from the race and immediately endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee. Harris eventually lost to Trump in November, decisively losing the popular vote and all seven swing states.","summary":"Senior advisers suggested the president needed the debate to quell concerns about his age and fitness.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/read-infamous-memo-that-urged-biden-debate-trump-early-2095526","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2678204/memo-biden.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 15:36:00","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":339191264,"title":"Biden White House Leak Reveals Advisers Urged Early Debate","text":"A newly leaked White House memo from April 2024 reveals that former President Joe Biden’s advisers urged him to debate now-President Donald Trump early in the election cycle to “reach the widest audience possible.” \n\nThe disastrous June 27 debate, in which Biden was often incoherent, was the death knell of his campaign.

It will likely become one of the most competitive—and expensive—races of the midterms, as the Great Lakes State has emerged as one of the closest battlegrounds over the past decade.Democrats are increasingly optimistic about a favorable national environment, particularly after the passage of President Donald Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill\" last week, and the party in the White House historically loses seats in the midterms. But Republicans are eyeing Michigan's Senate seat as a potential flip opportunity next year, as Trump narrowly carried the state last November.What To KnowThe poll, conducted by Normington Petts and first reported by Politico, measured support for former GOP Representative Mike Rogers against two Democratic candidates, Representative Haley Stevens and state Senator Mallory McMorrow. Both matchups were close.Rogers led McMorrow on a uninformed ballot by about 4 percentage points (48 percent to 44 percent), but when voters were told more information about each candidate, McMorrow led by 4 points (51 percent to 47 percent).On the other hand, Stevens led Rogers by about 2 points (47 percent to 45 percent), but by only a single point on the informed ballot (49 percent to 48 percent), according to the poll.Ahead of the Democratic primary next year, Stevens benefits from having higher name recognition than McMorrow. While 34 percent of respondents said they have heard of Stevens, only 22 percent have heard of McMorrow, according to the survey.It noted the most effective attack against Stevens was that she voted with former President Joe Biden more than 90 percent of the time in Congress, and that would be an \"an inevitable line of attack from Rogers and his allies.\" It noted that McMorrow, as a state lawmaker, does not have that vulnerability, though she did support the former administration and spoke at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in support of former Vice President Kamala Harris.The poll surveyed 700 likely voters from June 12-16 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.Reeves Oyster, a spokesperson for the Stevens campaign, responded to the poll in a statement to Newsweek.\"This is the latest poll that shows Haley Stevens is the candidate who will win in November because she has spent her life fighting and winning for the people of Michigan,\" Oyster said.The poll did not ask about Abdul El-Sayed, who is also running on the Democratic side.A survey conducted by the Glengariff Group and the Detroit Regional Chamber similarly pointed to a close race. It found Stevens leading Rogers by about 6 points (48.8 percent to 42.8 percent), while McMorrow led Rogers by fewer than 2 points (45.5 percent to 44.1 percent). That poll surveyed 600 registered voters from May 5-8 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 points.Rogers ran for U.S. Senate against Democrat Elissa Slotkin in November but lost despite Trump carrying the state. Stevens was first elected to a Detroit swing district in the 2018 midterms, while McMorrow rose to national prominence in 2022 after a speech she made defending the LGBTQ+ community went viral.What People Are SayingDemocratic consultant group Normington Petts, in the poll report: \"Any arguments alleging that Mallory McMorrow is somehow a poor general election candidate or that Haley Stevens is a superior general election candidate are equally refuted by these data. In fact, these data suggest that McMorrow has higher upside potential and that Stevens brings a vulnerability to the table that McMorrow does not possess.\"Senate candidate Mallory McMorrow told Newsweek in February: \"We have to be willing to not be afraid of stepping into any conversation and not being so polished all the time. People will trust you more if you don't sound like a sound bite all the time.\"Senate candidate Haley Stevens told Newsweek in May: \"As a native Michigander, who grew up as the daughter of small business owners in Southeast Michigan, my parents actually had a landscaping business. It was a ton of hard work, a lot of grease, grime, dirt. My dad picking me up, oftentimes covered in dirt, you know, and I'd say, 'Dad, why are you so dirty?' Well, it's because he was working hard. And it is that value of hard Michigan work that has motivated me my entire career.\"What Happens NextMichigan's primary will be held in August 2026, so candidates have more than a year to make their case to voters.

Here’s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: Photo by United States Department of Labor/PhotoQuest/Getty Images)\n\nIn this adapted excerpt from \"Not Just for the Boys: Why We Need More Women in Science\" (Oxford University Press, 2023), physicist Athene Donald examines the role of bias against women in scientific publishing, and its pervasiveness that still persists among academia.\n\nIn judging individuals, it might be thought that there are appropriate quantitative and objective metrics to be used. In reality, such metrics can be seen to disadvantage women. Different disciplines and different countries may exhibit these tendencies to a greater or lesser extent. Letters of reference — in science as elsewhere — tend to use fewer stand-out adjectives about women than men, meaning their chance of progression is reduced.\nWomen's papers are cited less; their grants are on average smaller; and their papers have a harder time getting past reviewers. A recent study of referees' comments highlighted just how unpleasant, not to mention unhelpful, referee comments may be. One example stated: \"This paper is, simply, manure.\" Hardly constructive criticism.\n\nYou may like\n\n'Foolhardy at best, and deceptive and dangerous at worst': Don't believe the hype — here's why artificial general intelligence isn't what the billionaires tell you it is\n\nAI is just as overconfident and biased as humans can be, study shows\n\nScientific research is the lifeblood of our economy. Now, a wrecking ball has come.\n\nAnd misogyny can feed into reviewers' comments, sometimes explicitly, as in the case of another review quoted in the same paper: \"The first author was a woman. She should be in the kitchen, not writing papers.\" I would like to think that referee was blacklisted thereafter by the editor concerned, but the fact the editor saw fit to pass the comments on makes me think that was unlikely.\n\nFaced with such responses, many researchers' confidence, and particularly those of women who are in the minority in a field, may be so shaken that they step back or quit altogether.\nUnderpinning many of the obstacles I've just outlined is bias, unconscious though it may be. Overt discrimination is not only illegal, it is now less evident. Rita Colwell, the bacteriologist and first woman to head up the U.S.'s major funding agency, the National Science Foundation (NSF) was told at the start of her career in 1956 that \"we don't waste fellowships on women.\" This remark made her angry, but it didn't stop her in her professional tracks, as it might have for many women then and since.\nMost senior academics would probably be more cautious to express such an opinion outright today, whether or not they privately harbored such thoughts. But it is not necessary to be aware of thinking that women are somehow second-class citizens; that opinion may seep into actions unconsciously.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\nGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nBias of this subterranean sort — variously known as unconscious or implicit bias — has come under intense scrutiny in recent years, as it should. Bias, at the individual level, acts as an unconscious reaction to all the stereotypes we have been fed since birth, and comes in many shapes and forms. It can be compared with Nobel Prize-winning Israeli psychologist Daniel Kahneman's two modes of thinking, System I and System 2.\nSystem 1, which operates automatically and quickly, in an essentially involuntary way, would give rise to unconscious bias of the sort that decides a woman is not as capable of being a scientist as a man but would be expected to be very good at childminding or nurturing more generally.\nSystem 2, the slower thinking process, takes the time to think through such a decision. That process allows the bias against women in that first thought to be teased out, confronted and, hopefully, rejected. Organizations that introduce unconscious bias training need to ensure that the need for moving on to slower, more considered (i.e. System 2) thinking is impressed on the individual, not imagine that the training is simply some sort of tickbox exercise telling people they should not be biased.\nThe latter, too commonly seen in online courses in particular, is totally insufficient to see outcomes shift, the only measure of the success of such a program. It may even backfire.\nThe subtle ways in which unconscious bias can operate in an academic setting was spelled out at length in Virginia Valian's classic book \"Why So Slow?\" (MIT Press, 1998) about the progression of women in academia. Despite Valian's book being a quarter of a century old, it is still a sobering read, highlighting all the different places where disadvantage may accrue across the university sector (and not just STEM).\nRelated: 30 amazing women in science and math\nWhat is the hard evidence, beyond anecdote and suspicion, that unconscious bias impacts on women's careers? Increasing numbers of studies show, in many different guises, just how potent such bias can be.\nOne of the most striking classes of study is that which compares the reactions of both men and women to identical CVs submitted under a typically male and a typically female name. Valian highlights a study from as far back as 1975 by L.S. Fidell, which demonstrates bias in her own field of psychology. Many studies since have gone on to demonstrate the pervasiveness of such bias, which does not seem to be disappearing.\nFor instance, in one much-cited study, faculty were sent identical CVs to evaluate, differing only in whether the name at the top appeared to be male or female. These were application materials for an undergraduate science student who had ostensibly applied for a science laboratory manager position. Both male and female faculty were more likely to \"hire\" the man, as well as offer him more support/training and a higher salary than the woman, despite the identical track records.\nThe late 1990s saw not only the publication of Valian's book, but also a paper regarding data from the Swedish Medical Research Council concerning biomedical fellowships, which used a Freedom of Information request to obtain the actual evaluation sheets used by the peer-review panel. Sweden, it should be noted, is generally regarded as one of the most egalitarian societies in the world when it comes to gender issues, but the findings would not have led a reader to make that assessment.\nThe title of the paper presenting the results of this study gives the game away: \"Nepotism and Sexism in Peer-Review.\" Using an array of metrics to devise a figure of merit for impact, it demonstrated graphically how great a difference there was in evaluators' competence scores for men and women objectively assessed to have demonstrated equivalent impact.\nThe authors' analysis showed that this discrepancy amounted to the equivalent of three papers in a high-ranking journal, such as Nature, or the phenomenal difference of 20 papers in a moderately highly ranked journal. Equally worrying was personal bias, the nepotism of the title, when an applicant was known to a panel member.\nDespite that particular person not being allowed to take part in the evaluation itself, as is customary with such funding panels, it transpired that the other panel members scored anyone known to have such an association more highly.\nBias comes in many forms, regardless of how much processes such as excluding a known associate from making the relevant judgement, may attempt to overcome them. When this study appeared, back in 1997, many women already had suspicions that they were being treated unfairly, or at least differentially compared with men.\nFor far too many of us, the message of the 1988 \"Miss Triggs\" cartoon will have felt painfully familiar then, and may still do so now. To counter this sort of behavior it is important for those around the table to chip in, to remind everyone that Miss Triggs did just say this and it is good that Mr X agrees.\n\n‘That’s an excellent suggestion, Miss Triggs. Perhaps one of the men here would like to make it.’30 years after this cartoon was published,many variations of this type of sexism still popular at home and at work. pic.twitter.com/ann5b68VeHAugust 11, 2019\n\nThis technique was brought more forcefully into the public's eyes by female staffers in the Obama White House, who called it amplification. As the Washington Post described it: When a woman made a key point, other women would repeat it, giving credit to its author. This forced the men in the room to recognize the contribution — and denied them the chance to claim the idea as their own.\nEvery committee around the world, in academia or not, could do with more pushing back on bad behavior from other committee members.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n—People really can communicate with just their eyes, study finds\n—Strikingly simple 'dial' in the brain may help it distinguish imagination from reality\n—People's mental health often improves after weight-loss surgery. A study pinpoints the real reason why.\nThe other tendency seen only too often at committees, debates, and other potentially confrontational situations, is that when men talk over another committee member it is typically a woman. Again, American politics shows a clear example of how to deal with this arrogant behavior; in the 2020 Vice Presidential debate, Kamala Harris calmly said over and over, \"Mr Vice President, I'm speaking.\" Many people would, however, find it easier if someone else, an ally male or female, made that very same point for them.\n© Athene Donald.

The 80-year-old could employ his son’s fame in Hollywood to build connections and gain a strong foothold in politics.\n\nWhile Leonardo might be on his way to a normal lifestyle, his father has become too ambitious over his political goals. He was spotted with his son at Rao’s hosting a dinner with high profile businessmen in NYC. According to a report, George wants to step into politics and he invited Leo to the dinner to back him up with his star power. Leo was not aware of the political agenda and thought it to be just a networking dinner.\n\nAs revealed by Rob Shuter on Substack, Leo did not know it was a political strategy session. George thinks that he’ll be able to bridge the gap between right-wing power and Hollywood. He’s aiming to use his son for that added power to try his hand at politics. However, George is a filmmaker and has no experience in the political world.\n\nSo, Leo may not be thrilled by this development. According to insiders, George has had his eye on politics for a while now. He considers his creative background to give him a fresh perspective to bridge the cultural divides.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nGeorge may be expecting more help from his son once he dives deep into politics, but this might turn out to be a backfire on Leo. He is popular so far for his huge age gap relationship and not dating anyone who is over 25 years old. Another thing he is known for is his political stance.\n\nDuring the elections, he was supporting Kamala Harris, so we know he won’t turn out to be a MAGA supporter. Moreover, he criticized Trump for his views on climate change. He called out Trump for denying science in his endorsement video for Kamala.\n\nGROWTH: Leonardo DiCaprio has decided to end his under-25 dating rule to date his new 27-year-old girlfriend.\nh/t @BacardiCapital pic.twitter.com/hZskrYbmyH\n— @amuse (@amuse) June 21, 2025\n\nEarlier in 2016, Leo did not support the Republican Party. He urged everyone to ignore Trump’s theatrics and not ignore his stance on climate change. According to him, Trump did not make up to be a reasonable person.\n\nHe argued on Trump’s candidature considering how people should not have a candidate who does not even believe in science. Leonardo has been an advocate for climate change making people aware of the concerning issue humanity is facing due to it.\n\nSince Leonardo did not know the dinner’s agenda, he may have been blindsided by his father while having company. Bruce Blakeman was present at the dinner, who is a former commissioner for the New York-New Jersey Port Authority.\n\nGeorge planned this dinner with a conservative supporting crowd and placed Leo in the middle of them.

The 50501 movement says it had decentralized protests across the country on Feb. 17, March 4, April 5, April 19, May 1, and June 14.\n\nThe organization frames itself as mainstream, saying that it wants to “uphold the Constitution,” and asserts on its website: “Our movement shows the world that the American working class will not sit idly by as plutocrats rip apart their democratic institutions and civil liberties while undermining the rule of law.”\n\nHowever, the Oversight Project, a Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group, contends that 50501’s social media engagement demonstrates the movement is not mainstream. \n\nInstagram accounts of the 50501 chapters were more likely to follow the Instagram accounts of radical organizations than they were to follow legacy media outlets and or almost any politician, according to an analysis by the Oversight Project. \n\n“Overall, all our results showed that the recent protest movement is broadly aligned with known communist, neo-Marxist, and foreign influence groups,” the Oversight Project report says. \n\nA spokesperson for 50501 did not respond to inquiries from The Daily Signal for this article as of publication time. \n\nThe Oversight Project says it collected lists of who 50501’s social media managers followed from 50501-affiliated Instagram accounts in 34 states and Washington, D.C. The Oversight Project used that data to determine who 50501 organizers associated their movement with. \n\n“From this we conclude that, despite their public pronouncements about protecting democracy and opposing authoritarianism, the organizers of the ‘No Kings’ protests are aligned with antidemocratic groups who seek to impose a communist utopia in America,” the Oversight Project report states. “The American people have long rejected these ideas as the road to leftist dictatorship.”\n\nThe report says 17 separate 50501 chapter accounts follow a total of 20 accounts affiliated with the Party for Socialism and Liberation. Most of those party accounts were the official accounts of local PSL chapters. \n\nThe analysis found that 19 other Instagram accounts affiliated with the 50501 movement follow 33 Instagram accounts associated with the Democratic Socialists of America. The Democratic Socialists of America is the largest far-left socialist party in the United States. It counts among its members Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\nThe Oversight Project analysis found that nine 50501 accounts followed a total of 16 Instagram accounts associated with Students for a Democratic Society, which has been a radical leftist group since the 1960s. \n\nAssociated organizations generally means a local or state chapter.\n\nThe Oversight Project analysis found that 50501 chapters in Houston, Texas, and Washington state followed the Communist Party USA. It further found 50501 accounts followed just two different accounts associated with antifa, a far-left organization that has committed violence during riots and protests. \n\nThe 50501 Florida chapter has followed @antifintl, which claims to be “Antifa International.” \n\nAs far as politicians go, only Sanders gets more 50501 Instagram followers—21—than any of the far-left groups. Ocasio-Cortez has 16 followers from 50501 accounts. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, is followed by 11 of 50501’s Instagram accounts.\n\n“Surprisingly, the most followed radical-left groups received more follows from 50501 accounts than any media outlet and nearly all politicians,” the Oversight Project report says. \n\nOther prominent Democrat politicians, such as former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and House Minority Leader Rep Hakeem Jeffries of New York have single-digit followings from 50501 accounts.\n\nAmong media outlets, NPR and PBS are followed by 12 separate 50501 accounts, by far the most. MSNBC has just four such followers. The Associated Press is followed by eight, while The New York Times is followed by five 50501 accounts.\n\nNPR and PBS did not respond to inquiries for this article.\n\nSeveral anti-Israel groups that became more prominent over the past two years amid anti-Israel protests occurring primarily on college campuses are also part of the mix.\n\nAmong those has been Students for Justice in Palestine. The Oversight Project analysis found that nine separate 50501 accounts followed 12 separate accounts affiliated with Students for Justice in Palestine.\n\nAn organization that has frequented rallies for Palestinians has been the ANSWER Coalition, short for Act Now to Stop War and End Racism. Chapters of 50501 in Washington state and Rhode Island follow ANSWER, the Oversight Project analysis found. ANSWER was established after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to oppose U.S. wars. \n\nAnother group that emerged in the lead-up to the Iraq War, Code Pink, is followed by two 50501 accounts. \n\nThe Oversight Project also found the 50501 chapter in Houston, as well as state chapters in Florida and Washington state, followed the All African People’s Revolutionary Party, which has described itself as a “permanent, independent, revolutionary, socialist, Pan-African Political Party based in Africa” and “is an integral part of the Pan-African and World Socialist revolutionary movement.”","summary":"A key organizer of anti-Trump protests—including the “No Kings” rallies last month—appears to have social media connections with far-left organizations that include openly communist and...

FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nThe news that Paramount settled with President Trump for $16 million over alleged 60 Minutes edits that Trump alleged favored then Vice President Kamala Harris prompted criticism from some in the media. When Harris was asked about the Biden administration’s relationship with Israel’s prime minister, CBS producers used different portions of her answer on two programs. One response was on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” with a shorter one on “60 Minutes.” Many in the media criticized Paramount, but like other lawsuits that Trump has settled, there was an interesting tax angle.\n\nThe money goes to pay Trump’s legal fees, and to his Presidential Library. Trump used the same technique in his $15 million settlement with ABC News over alleged defamation by George Stephanopoulos. Meta also settled with Trump, paying $25 million over suspending his social media accounts, and the funds once again were for legal fees and his Presidential Library. The widespread assumption is that this avoids taxes.\n\nIn general, though, the IRS view is that settling a lawsuit by having the money paid to charity may not always be a 100% tax solution. In some cases, a plaintiff’s request to have settlement funds paid to charity are viewed by the IRS as a payment first to the plaintiff, and then a contribution by him to charity. That may be subject to percentage income limits, which in some cases means that the whole charitable contribution deduction may not be available in the year of the settlement.\n\nPaying Trump’s Legal Fees\n\nIf the settlement pays legal bills that President Trump would otherwise owe, the IRS could call that taxable income. When someone discharges your liability, the IRS often views that as income, even you never handle the cash.\n\nSimilarly, if Trump receives a reimbursement out of the Paramount settlement for legal fees that he has already paid, is that income? It depends on whether Trump has deducted the legal fees on his taxes that are later reimbursed. If he has deducted the fees, the IRS usually requires reimbursed amounts to be treated as income.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nMost Settlements Are Taxable\n\nDirecting settlement money to charity can work in some cases, but even that is not foolproof, as noted above. And having the settlement agreement direct the money to someone else — say a friend or relative — usually does not avoid taxes to the plaintiff either. The IRS taxes the person who had a legal right to payment. Many plaintiffs win or settle a lawsuit only to be surprised that they have to pay taxes. Some don’t realize it until tax time the following year when IRS Forms 1099 arrive in the mail.\n\nTaxes on legal settlements are based on the origin of your claim. If you get laid off at work and sue for wages, you’ll be taxed as wages, usually with a portion on a Form 1099 for emotional distress. But the rules are full of exceptions and nuances, so be careful, how settlement awards are taxed.\n\nLimited Exclusion\n\nOne limited exclusion from taxes applies to physical injury damages. Before 1996, all “personal” damages were tax-free, so emotional distress and defamation produced tax-free recoveries. But since 1996, your injury must be “physical.” Trump alleged that the the “60 Minutes” edits caused him mental anguish, but that clearly would not qualfy for a tax exclusion. The IRS treats mental anguish, as well as physical symptoms of emotional distress (like headaches and stomachaches) as taxable.\n\nThere are many chicken or egg tax cases, and many plaintiffs take aggressive positions on their tax returns, trying to explain their IRS Form 1099. Haggling over tax details before you sign and settle is best. Such agreements aren’t binding on the IRS or the courts in later tax disputes, but they are usually not ignored by the IRS. Most legal disputes involve multiple issues. You might claim that the defendant kept your laptop, frittered away your trust fund, underpaid you, failed to reimburse you for a business trip, or other items. Even if your dispute relates to one course of conduct, there’s a good chance the total settlement involves several types of consideration.\n\nHow Legal Fees Are Taxed\n\nHow legal fees are taxed is tricky too. If you are the plaintiff and use a contingent fee lawyer, you’ll be treated (for tax purposes) as receiving 100% of the money recovered by you and your attorney, even if the defendant pays your lawyer directly. If your case is fully nontaxable (say an auto accident in which you are injured), that shouldn’t cause any tax problems. But if your recovery is taxable, watch out. Say you settle a suit for intentional infliction of emotional distress against your neighbor for $100,000, and your lawyer keeps $40,000. You might think you’d have $60,000 of income. Instead, you’ll have $100,000 of income.\n\nIn 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Commissioner v. Banks, that plaintiffs generally have income equal to 100% of their recoveries. even if their lawyers take a share. How about deducting the legal fees? In 2004, Congress enacted an above the line deduction for legal fees in employment claims and certain whistleblower claims. But outside these two areas, in some cases it is very difficult to find a deduction for legal fees. Tax advice early before the case settles and the settlement agreement is signed is best. Fortunately, there are often ways to deduct legal fees even under the new law.\n\nPunitive Damages & Interest\n\nPunitive damages and interest are always taxable. If you are injured in a car crash and collect $50,000 in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages, the former is tax-free. But the $5 million is fully taxable, and you can have trouble deducting your attorney fees. The same occurs with interest. You might receive a tax-free settlement or judgment, but pre-judgment or post-judgment interest is always taxable (and can produce attorney fee problems). Sometimes, that can make it attractive to settle your case rather than going to judgment.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"The money goes to pay Trump’s legal fees, and to his Presidential Library.

Staffers who worked on celebrity appearances were instructed not to make any outreach to her universe; Doug Emhoff was handling it,’ wrote journalists Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager and Isaac Arnsdorf. \n\nEmhoff, the authors explained, had an in with Swift’s team.\n\n‘Before Harris became vice president, Emhoff had had a lucrative career as an entertainment lawyer in Los Angeles,’ they wrote. ‘He and Swift’s lawyer, Doug Baldridge, were both partners at the firm Venable.’ \n\nEmhoff, the authors wrote, had reached out to Baldridge to ‘convey that the campaign would appreciate any efforts the pop star could make to help Harris.’ \n\n‘Baldridge said Swift would do what Swift thought was best,’ they said. \n\nOn September 10, Harris stepped onstage in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for a first and only debate against the GOP nominee, former President Donald Trump. \n\n‘Minutes after the debate ended, Taylor Swift surprised the campaign with a full- throated endorsement posted on her Instagram,’ the authors noted. ‘She shared a photo of her with her cat, Benjamin Button, and signed it “Childless Cat Lady,” a dig at J.D. Vance.’\n\nWith no audience in the actual debate hall, the Harris campaign had set up shop at the Cherry Street Pier, an old warehouse on the Delaware River converted into art galleries and a performance space. \n\n‘Harris asked if she should mention the endorsement when she spoke to supporters at a watch party,’ the authors said. ‘They said that would sound too thirsty, but agreed to change her walk-off song to Swift’s “The Man.”‘ \n\nThe mood in the room was electric – and it only seemed a matter of time before Swift, herself, would make some sort of appearance along Harris’ side. \n\nSwift famously didn’t step into politics until the 2018 campaign cycle – endorsing Tennessee Senate candidate Phil Bredesen and Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper – and expressing remorse in the documentary Taylor Swift: Miss Americana for not doing more to help Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Trump in 2016. \n\nShe endorsed Joe Biden via social media in 2020 – though the COVID-19 pandemic and Biden’s COVID-conscious campaign strategy meant that celebrity engagement was limited. \n\nBut the Harris campaign ‘dedicated huge resources in the final month to massive rallies with celebrity guests,’ the authors noted. ‘Harris and Walz said they were bringing joy back to politics, and massive celebrity-filled rallies – Meghan Thee Stallion performed in Atlanta, Maggie Rogers in Ann Arbor, Gracie Abrams and Mumford & Sons in Madison, Wisconsin – were key to that strategy.’\n\nBeyonce – who had been rumored to appear alongside Harris at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August – finally hit the campaign trail at a special abortion rights rally in the songstress’ hometown of Houston, Texas in late October. \n\n‘But privately, some campaign staff raised concerns that the major rallies may not be worth the millions of dollars they cost to stage or the staff investment,’ the authors said. ‘There was scant evidence that the rallies were persuading voters or necessarily boosting turnout.’ \n\nFederal Election Commission filings later showed the Harris paid Beyonce’s production company, Parkwood Production Media LLC, $165,000 for that event. \n\nThere were also concerns about some of the celebrity assignments – such as sending Bruce Springsteen, whose fans are predominantly white, to Clarkston, Georgia, where the city’s population is 70 percent black and 50 percent foreign-born. \n\n‘The predominantly white press corps seemed more interested in Springsteen’s performance than the 23,000 mostly black attendees,’ the authors wrote. \n\nStill, the celeb-filled Harris-Walz campaign carried on. \n\nAnd still no Taylor.\n\nIn the final hours before Election Day, there was some evidence that a Swift appearance may finally be happening. \n\nOn Monday, November 4, Harris was heading to Pennsylvania and would door-knock with volunteers in Reading, the closest city to Swift’s birthplace. \n\n‘Rumors flew that the town’s most famous daughter, Taylor Swift, would join Harris there or perform at a last rally in Philadelphia,’ the authors said. ‘Low-level Harris aides did nothing to tamp down the speculation.’\n\nInstead the final night featured performances by 2 Chainz in Raleigh, Christina Aguilera in Las Vegas and Jon Bon Jovi in Detroit, which the authors called ‘another head-scratcher for many black voters.’ \n\nReprising the role she played in 2016 and 2020, Lady Gaga was the main act for the final event, performing songs in front of the Rocky steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. \n\nEmhoff had been told that Swift would do what Swift thought best. \n\n‘Nothing more than the endorsement ever materialized,’ the authors said. \n\nA spokesperson for Swift did not respond to the Daily Mail’s request for comment. \n\n2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America arrives in bookstores Tuesday.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAmidst rumors and growing excitement about the possibility of her joining forces&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Why Taylor Swift Chose to Skip Campaigning with Kamala Harris first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/why-taylor-swift-chose-to-skip-campaigning-with-kamala-harris/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Why-Taylor-Swift-snubbed-Kamala-Harris-on-the-campaign-trail.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 12:50:10","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.173},{"id":339102090,"title":"'Massive conspiracy': Ex-DNC insider says party went to great lengths to hide Biden's mental decline","text":"One year after the disastrous debate performance that forced former President Joe Biden to ultimately suspend his re-election campaign, questions remain about the oft-alleged \"cover-up\" of his cognitive decline. In a wide-ranging exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, Lindy Li, a former Democratic National Committee (DNC) fundraiser and National Finance Committee member, detailed her front-row seat to the careful coordination by Biden's inner circle to conceal how the octogenarian's age impacted his presidency. Biden Cabinet members' testimonies to the House Oversight Committee and journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson in their book, \"Original Sin,\" have raised more questions about what exactly happened during Biden's tenure. \"I was banned from the Biden White House for telling the truth when it mattered,\" Li told Fox News Digital. \"I actually took a risk. Jake Tapper wrote a book and decided to tell the truth and have his Eureka moment after it was safe, after Biden had gone to pasture. There was nothing on the line for him.\" EX-DNC INSIDER REVEALS 'PUPPET MASTERS' WHO RAN THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE Tapper did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. FLASHBACK: THE DEBATE NIGHT AGAINST TRUMP THAT THREW BIDEN'S REELECTION CAMPAIGN INTO A FREE FALL The former Democrat, who said she has faced the wrath of her former friends and colleagues since she left the party, explained that she had been raising her concerns about Biden's age for years. According to Li, Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., told her in 2022 that Biden was too old to run for re-election. One year later, she caught a glimpse of Duckworth \"singing Biden's praises\" on TV. \"That day was when she decided to become his campaign co-chair,\" Li said. \"A full year later, he's not getting any younger.\" Duckworth did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. While Democrats like Duckworth seemed to eventually accept Biden's decision to run for re-election, Li said she continued speaking out – and it cost her. \"To be treated like a complete criminal was just jarring for me,\" Li said. \"I just asked a question too. I wasn't attacking anybody. I just [asked] if maybe he should step down, in the nicest way possible.\" Li said she was posing these questions to top officials at the DNC, including former chair Jaime Harrison and current chair Ken Martin. The DNC did not respond to multiple Fox News Digital inquiries about her allegations. \"We were given talking points,\" Li said. \"Every time they say they're not paying attention, or they didn't take something seriously, they paid attention, and they took it seriously.\" But going against the Democratic Party came at a personal sacrifice, Li explained to Fox News Digital. \"I hosted [Biden] and Kamala Harris on Feb. 3, coinciding with the DNC Winter Meeting, and they confiscated my phone,\" Li said. She said a DNC coalition director singled her out at the event and told her not to post anything on social media. When she posted an Instagram story of Biden at a separate dinner event, Li said she was shocked when the DNC called her \"in a fit of fury\" and told her to take it down. \"It was hard for me because I was one of the youngest members on the committee, if not the youngest, so I didn't have the age or the gravitas,\" Li said. \"I just don't think they listened.\" She added that the alleged cover-up was a \"left-wing massive conspiracy\" that included handpicked talking points from the DNC and the White House. \"It encompassed not just the White House, but all the influencers they had on their payroll. Do not tell me they didn't have influencers on their payroll because they literally paid me,\" Li said. After Special Counsel Robert Hur did not recommend criminal charges against Biden in his classified documents case, as Hur referred to Biden as \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,\" Li said the DNC told her to \"tar and feather\" Hur's character. \"They were in damage control mode. We were basically supposed to say [Biden] was a genius, in not so many words, but basically he is like this wizard behind closed doors, and how with age comes wisdom.\" \"We were supposed to undermine his character,\" Li added about Hur. \"Yeah, we were supposed to assassinate his character.\" And after Biden's consequential debate performance, Li said, \"Jen O'Malley Dillon did a damage control briefing that morning, and people were misty-eyed. The previous night, people were crying on a shuttle home because they were so devastated by the debate.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But O'Malley Dillon and Julie Rodriguez, Biden's campaign chairs, claimed it was \"impossible\" for Biden to drop out of the race, arguing that finance regulations prevent that.

Staffers who worked on celebrity appearances were instructed not to make any outreach to her universe; Doug Emhoff was handling it,' wrote journalists Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager and Isaac Arnsdorf. \n\nEmhoff, the authors explained, had an in with Swift's team.\n\n'Before Harris became vice president, Emhoff had had a lucrative career as an entertainment lawyer in Los Angeles,' they wrote. 'He and Swift's lawyer, Doug Baldridge, were both partners at the firm Venable.' \n\nEmhoff, the authors wrote, had reached out to Baldridge to 'convey that the campaign would appreciate any efforts the pop star could make to help Harris.' \n\n'Baldridge said Swift would do what Swift thought was best,' they said. \n\nOn September 10, Harris stepped onstage in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for a first and only debate against the GOP nominee, former President Donald Trump. \n\n'Minutes after the debate ended, Taylor Swift surprised the campaign with a full- throated endorsement posted on her Instagram,' the authors noted. 'She shared a photo of her with her cat, Benjamin Button, and signed it \"Childless Cat Lady,\" a dig at J.D. Vance.'\n\nWith no audience in the actual debate hall, the Harris campaign had set up shop at the Cherry Street Pier, an old warehouse on the Delaware River converted into art galleries and a performance space. \n\n'Harris asked if she should mention the endorsement when she spoke to supporters at a watch party,' the authors said. 'They said that would sound too thirsty, but agreed to change her walk-off song to Swift's \"The Man.\"' \n\nThe mood in the room was electric - and it only seemed a matter of time before Swift, herself, would make some sort of appearance along Harris' side. \n\nSwift famously didn't step into politics until the 2018 campaign cycle - endorsing Tennessee Senate candidate Phil Bredesen and Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper - and expressing remorse in the documentary Taylor Swift: Miss Americana for not doing more to help Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Trump in 2016. \n\nShe endorsed Joe Biden via social media in 2020 - though the COVID-19 pandemic and Biden's COVID-conscious campaign strategy meant that celebrity engagement was limited. \n\nBut the Harris campaign 'dedicated huge resources in the final month to massive rallies with celebrity guests,' the authors noted. 'Harris and Walz said they were bringing joy back to politics, and massive celebrity-filled rallies - Meghan Thee Stallion performed in Atlanta, Maggie Rogers in Ann Arbor, Gracie Abrams and Mumford & Sons in Madison, Wisconsin - were key to that strategy.'\n\nBeyonce - who had been rumored to appear alongside Harris at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August - finally hit the campaign trail at a special abortion rights rally in the songstress' hometown of Houston, Texas in late October. \n\n'But privately, some campaign staff raised concerns that the major rallies may not be worth the millions of dollars they cost to stage or the staff investment,' the authors said. 'There was scant evidence that the rallies were persuading voters or necessarily boosting turnout.' \n\nFederal Election Commission filings later showed the Harris paid Beyonce's production company, Parkwood Production Media LLC, $165,000 for that event. \n\nThere were also concerns about some of the celebrity assignments - such as sending Bruce Springsteen, whose fans are predominantly white, to Clarkston, Georgia, where the city's population is 70 percent black and 50 percent foreign-born. \n\n'The predominantly white press corps seemed more interested in Springsteen's performance than the 23,000 mostly black attendees,' the authors wrote. \n\nStill, the celeb-filled Harris-Walz campaign carried on. \n\nAnd still no Taylor.\n\nIn the final hours before Election Day, there was some evidence that a Swift appearance may finally be happening. \n\nOn Monday, November 4, Harris was heading to Pennsylvania and would door-knock with volunteers in Reading, the closest city to Swift's birthplace. \n\n'Rumors flew that the town's most famous daughter, Taylor Swift, would join Harris there or perform at a last rally in Philadelphia,' the authors said. 'Low-level Harris aides did nothing to tamp down the speculation.'\n\nInstead the final night featured performances by 2 Chainz in Raleigh, Christina Aguilera in Las Vegas and Jon Bon Jovi in Detroit, which the authors called 'another head-scratcher for many black voters.' \n\nReprising the role she played in 2016 and 2020, Lady Gaga was the main act for the final event, performing songs in front of the Rocky steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. \n\nEmhoff had been told that Swift would do what Swift thought best. \n\n'Nothing more than the endorsement ever materialized,' the authors said. \n\nA spokesperson for Swift did not respond to the Daily Mail's request for comment. \n\n2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America arrives in bookstores Tuesday.","summary":"Despite building anticipation she could join Beyonce or Lady Gaga for the biggest political and pop culture spectacle in history, Taylor Swift never showed up to campaign for Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14866051/taylor-swift-campaign-trail-kamala-harris.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/02/21/99944103-0-image-m-36_1751487513757.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 11:14:37","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.201},{"id":339092502,"title":"Olivia Attwood hits out at the 'stigma' of WAG culture and insists her footballer husband doesn't contribute to her lavish lifestyle","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Jul 7th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParents who raised £100K for their son before he died from cancer sue charity which refuses to hand over donations - because they want the cash to take his terminally-ill sister to Disney World\n\nPanic over Labour 'wealth tax' to fill £30bn black hole in government finances - with warning millionaires have ALREADY moved huge amounts of cash out of UK\n\nRoyal Family lead nation in remembering those who lost their lives in 7/7 terror attack 20 years ago\n\nThe shocking secret about mushroom killer that is being kept from Australia: GUY ADAMS reveals the sensational truth about trial that has rocked a nation\n\nThe 'screaming ghost' photo still haunts police.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy CHLOE LOUISE FOR MAILONLINE\n Published:12:05 BST, 7 July 2025 |Updated:12:13 BST, 7 July 2025 \n\nShe became a bona fide WAG when she tied the knot with footballer Bradley Dack in a lavish central London ceremony in the summer of 2023.\nBut Olivia Attwood has hit out at the 'stigma' of being the partner of a successful sportsman, insisting she funds her lavish lifestyle and has worked 'relentlessly' since being catapulted to fame when she left the Love Island villa in 2017. \nThe TV personality, 34, dated Bradley, 31, prior to entering the ITV reality show and he was already a footballer playing for League Two team Gillingham FC. \nOlivia slammed 'gold digger' claims and said it doesn't matter what job her husband has because she works 'seven days a week'. \nShe told MailOnline: 'I think people are like, \"She works seven days a week, surely she's got some f*****g cash\".\n'Maybe in the beginning when Brad and I first started dating, there was a bit of a stigma around it [dating someone who plays sport for a living]. \n\nOlivia Attwood has hit out at the 'stigma' of being the partner of a successful sportsman, insisting she funds her lavish lifestyle and has worked 'relentlessly' \n\nThe TV personality, 34, became a bona fide WAG when she tied the knot with footballer Bradley Dack, 31, in a lavish central London ceremony in the summer of 2023 \n'And people can kind of go, \"Oh\", a bit of an eye roll and stupid comments like, \"Oh my gosh she's with him cos he plays football\". \n'I've got my own money, so it doesn't really matter what he does for a job.'\nStraight-talking Olivia shot to fame thanks to her stint in the Love Island villa in the summer of 2017, which saw her reach the show final with her ex-boyfriend Chris Hughes, 32, who she dated until February 2018. \nThe former grid girl has since become a household name and a regular face on TV, appearing on The Only Way Is Essex, I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, This Morning and Loose Women.\nOlivia has also fronted many of her own shows and presented Bad Boyfriends, Getting Filthy Rich and The Price Of Perfection - admitting she has 'bitten the hands off' TV executives for 'big jobs, little jobs, whatever I could get'. \nBut this success did not come overnight and she told how she 'grafted' when she left the villa while working relentlessly to get where she is today. \nOlivia told MailOnline: 'Post Love Island, I knew where I wanted to be. I knew I wanted to stay working in television, and I was very dedicated to that, and everything I've done is working towards that bigger goal.\n'I've been very patient and I've learnt the craft, I'm still learning, I've taken the big jobs, the little jobs, whatever I could get, I just bite their hand off for it.'\n\nOlivia dated Bradley prior to entering ITV reality show Love Island in 2017 and he was already a footballer playing for League Two team Gillingham FC \n\nOlivia slammed 'gold digger' claims and said it doesn't matter what job her husband has because she works 'seven days a week' \n\nStraight-talking Olivia shot to fame thanks to her stint in the Love Island villa in the summer of 2017, which saw her reach the show final with her ex-boyfriend Chris Hughes, 32 (pictured)\n'Relentlessly pursuing that bigger goal and I'm working really hard at it, it doesn't come overnight', she added. \n\n Olivia Attwood - a relationship timeline: From romantic Dubai proposal with fiancé Bradley Dack to TWO wedding postponements and THAT breakup with Chris Hughes... a look back at reality star's love life ahead of her stint on I'm A Celebrity \n'Even when you get a big platform like Love Island, you still need to prove yourself to people. \n'I think sometimes people become impatient off the back of reality shows, but these kind of things, they don't happen overnight, you have to stick with it. It takes graft.' \nOlivia has enjoyed the spoils of a lavish lifestyle thanks to her lucrative television career and is regularly seen toting around Chanel and Hermes handbags.\nShe has also enjoyed many luxurious trips throughout the years - in the last nine weeks she has been seen in France, Miami and Ibiza. \nIn her popular TV documentary, Price Of Perfection, Olivia was very candid about her own cosmetic tweakments and confessed she spends a 'couple of grand a month' maintaining her image. \nOlivia and footballer Bradley originally began dating before she went looking for love in the Mallorcan Love Island villa in 2017. \nThe pair met at a nightclub in the West End back in 2015 after being introduced through mutual friends.\n\n Olivia Attwood admits it's 'difficult' finding enough time to spend with husband Bradley Dack \nThey dated on and off for three months before the romance fizzled out and Olivia decided to go on Love Island - later confirming Bradley was the ex she spoke about in her introduction clip.\nOlivia and Chris broke up in February 2018, less than a year after they reached the final of Love Island - and it wasn't long before the star was back with Bradley, with the couple reuniting in early 2018. \nOlivia announced their engagement in October 2019, sharing sweet snaps of the couple on a beach in Dubai after the footballer popped the question.\nAlongside the photos, she wrote: 'He must be crazy...

He speaks slowly: “With Donald Trump taking the White House and RFK Jr. now positioned to dismantle the uniparty’s corrupt FDA …. multibillion dollar drug conglomerates, some of Big Pharma’s oldest and most prominent, will be in a desperate race to flood our nation with poison.”\n\nThe man urges “seniors like you and me” to join the online “Health Sciences Institute,” where they can learn about alleged “remarkable medical breakthroughs” that the government and pharmaceutical companies “have been intentionally hiding.” (The Institute’s website contains a disclaimer stating that its content should not be interpreted as personal medical advice.) The man’s video is one of many of longform advertisements produced by The Agora and its sprawling conglomerate of subsidiaries, which have spent decades cashing in on Americans’ growing distrust in government, financial institutions and healthcare providers.\n\nThe Agora makes its money by selling subscriptions to “natural health” newsletters that are a vector for its wellness supplements business, as well as investment advice newsletters that can cost thousands of dollars a year. Across the internet, the company spends millions to place its outlandish claims in front of American social media users. A current spate of ads insist that President Trump will soon “unleash” a $150 trillion “secret trust” that has been hidden from the American people, and you can get rich from trading on it, if you just subscribe. The Agora has spent at least $500,000 promoting the claim on Meta’s platforms alone, according to the Meta ad library.\n\nThe Agora’s business is huge. It says it is a “1.5bn+ company,” and its subsidiaries pour millions each month into advertising on Facebook and Instagram. Agora-related channels have more than 100 million views on YouTube, and the company’s top-performing newsletters boast millions of subscribers. The consumer protection group Truth in Advertising estimated that it pulled in approximately $500 million in revenue in 2021 alone.\n\nBut a Forbes investigation into hundreds of Agora-linked ads, domains, and opaque social media accounts — and interviews with six people who have worked for Agora companies— reveal a company that has found success by misleading vulnerable people.\n\nOn websites maintained by TrustPilot and the Better Business Bureau, a sprawling network of companies under the Agora umbrella have amassed hundreds of one-star reviews. In them, customers describe spending thousands of dollars on lifetime subscriptions to newsletters that abruptly ended without refunds, and/or losing money by taking the newsletters’ investing advice. In one review, a former customer describes “wasting” more than $15,000 on Agora’s products — including a “special VIP membership” with exclusive newsletter updates, alerts, and videos, that cost more than $9,500. The customer declined to provide more detail when reached for comment.\n\n“This is the perfect storm for a company like Agora to manipulate consumers in the U.S.”\n\nBonnie Patten, Executive Director of Truth In Advertising\n\nOne former employee of an Agora company said that after a week of onboarding at The Agora’s Baltimore offices, she began to worry the company’s business was predicated on taking advantage of older people. She said she looked up her own elderly family members in the company’s customer database to ensure that none of them were buying its products.\n\nFor more than three decades, regulators have tried to stop The Agora from engaging in what they have called “false promises” in its marketing. In 2003, the SEC sued several Agora subsidiaries for advertising insider trading tips, which caused a judge to order $1.5 million in restitution and civil penalties. (The judge found that Agora Inc., the parent company, had not engaged in wrongdoing.) In 2016, a different Agora subsidiary was sued by the attorneys general of Pennsylvania and Oregon for misleading consumers, falsely claiming that they could receive benefits from big tobacco settlements made many years before. The company settled with both states.\n\nIn 2019, the FTC sued several Agora entities over products that promised a sham cure for Type 2 diabetes, and information about a nonexistent government benefits program. In late 2021, the company settled with the FTC, and was forced to refund nearly 35,000 Americans who had paid for certain products. The refunds totaled more than $2 million. The company did not admit wrongdoing, and told the Baltimore Sun that it was relieved to get back to publishing new content for its customers.\n\nDespite regulatory action, The Agora seems to have done little to change its ways — and it’s poised to continue its practices at a moment when Trump has gutted consumer protection enforcement, social media companies have taken their proverbial feet off the gas when it comes to taking down misleading messages, and mistrust in institutions is at an all-time high. As Bonnie Patten, Executive Director of the nonprofit consumer protection group Truth in Advertising (TINA), told Forbes, “This is the perfect storm for a company like Agora to manipulate consumers in the U.S.”\n\nThe Agora did not respond to repeated requests for interviews or to a request for comment.\n\nBill Bonner and Addison Wiggin, The Agora’s founders, have been selling doomsday investment advice since 1979 — the advent of the internet itself. In the early 2000s, the pair co-authored two New York Times bestsellers, Financial Reckoning Day and Empire of Debt. Bonner later became a Business Insider contributor, and Wiggin a Forbes contributor (he has not published since 2015). Today, from a block of swanky rowhomes in downtown Baltimore, the company they built offers more than a hundred investment and “natural” health-focused newsletters, which are distributed through a network of more than 20 publisher subsidiaries.\n\nBonner and The Agora’s current CEO, Erika Nolan, did not respond to interview requests or requests for comment on this story. Wiggin initially responded and scheduled an interview with Forbes, but didn’t show up. He then said in an email that he had forwarded our correspondence to the Agora Companies legal team, and did not respond to additional requests for an interview.\n\nMany people’s first encounters with The Agora start with a Facebook or Instagram ad teasing some shocking new risk or discovery. Its strategy is known as “direct response copywriting”: writing advertisements that convince someone to buy something on the spot. When they click on the ad, they’re taken to a page hosting a longform video, known internally at Agora as a VSL, or “video sales letter,” which can run for an hour or longer. Each features a finance or health “guru” — a personality that The Agora has cultivated as a face of its operations.\n\nThe Agora has tapped numerous public figures to become “gurus” across its lifetime, making use of their reputations to convert potential customers. Agora gurus have included Robert Kiyosaki, the now-bankrupt motivational speaker and author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad; James Altucher, a cryptocurrency podcaster who founded the former finance social network, StockPickr and authored the financial self-help book Choose Yourself; and Whitney Tilson, a Democratic candidate for New York City mayor who previously helped found Teach For America. (Kiyosaki, Altucher, and Tilson did not respond to interview requests.)\n\nIn the Agora playbook, “gurus” first sell viewers on a modestly priced newsletter subscription. In one current promotion, a balding man in a sport coat sits in front of an American flag and a shelf of gold-leaf lettered books explaining that President Trump can and will run for a third term. (Legally, he cannot.). The man says he’s coming forward at great personal risk, to reveal trading secrets that will make you rich, if you sign up for his newsletter for $49.00.\n\nOnce a guru makes that initial sale, known as the “front end,” the purchaser starts receiving pitches for Agora’s “back end”, which involves opportunities to, say, join a $10,000 exclusive investment club, or attend a $2,000 stock-picking webinar.\n\nThe “back end” is where Agora makes its real money. In addition to a panoply of special-offer newsletters and exclusive clubs, Agora subsidiaries also sell dietary supplements and other wellness products, through more than a dozen brands. Offerings include colorfully named cocktails like Memotex (for memory), Virasurge (sexual function) and Ultra Vital Gold (anti-aging). One Agora company also sells a water purifier called Turapür that promises to “transform average tap water into the antioxidant fountain of energy.”\n\nIn an Ask Me Anything video on YouTube in 2017, one Agora employee explained how the system works. “One of the promotions that you may have seen is that a German scientist discovered a cure for cancer in 1944, and the powers that be have hidden it from us until now,” Agora marketing director Matt Lazas explained. “We use a model of big ideas and longform sales newsletters to acquire the customers, and then on the back end, we have a whole stable of supplements that we monetize those customers on.” Lazas did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Agora has become a titan of social media, running millions of dollars’ worth of ads on Facebook and Instagram from opaque accounts with names like “America’s Secret Fund.”\n\n\"Over the last few weeks, roughly 30 million ounces of gold have been quietly moved from London vaults to the U.S.,” began one Agora ad running from a Meta page called Freedom Asset Advocates earlier this month. “My sources tell me this massive gold movement is tied to an upcoming shift in the global monetary system. The kind that happens once every 50-100 years ... I've identified 4 gold mining stocks perfectly positioned to potentially return 100x when this plays out.\" Meta spokesperson Erin Logan told Forbes that the company is now reviewing a list of Agora-related pages for violations of its policies, and the Ad Library showed that at least 11 pages running ads for Agora subsidiaries have now been “deleted or unpublished.”\n\nOn YouTube, a recent Agora ad promised “a new wave of AI wealth” that one guru said “will be 14x bigger than chatbots, generative AI, and quantum AI combined.” Placed from a channel with the handle @novileanlifedaily5807 and the title Opportunistic Trader, the ad had been viewed more than 840,000 times. A Google text ad promises a “proven method” to make “300%+ Stock Gains at 9:30 AM.” Google removed both ads after receiving a Forbes inquiry about them.\n\nBoth Meta (which owns Facebook and Instagram) and Google (which owns YouTube) have slackened their enforcement of policies banning harmful misinformation in recent months. Meta has removed many of The Agora’s ads, and some of the pages and accounts that run them. But it has continued to run hundreds more. Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal found that Meta rarely severs ties completely with big-money advertisers, and the platform acknowledged that it was facing “an epidemic of scams” of increasing complexity. The New York Times recently reported that YouTube had relaxed its enforcement of policies that have for years banned harmful misinformation from its platform.\n\nIn many ways, The Agora’s social media strategy mirrors its corporate structure. Today, The Agora says it includes more than 20 companies, though at various points in its 45-year history, it has included even more than that. On LinkedIn, one former staffer described a phenomenon that he deemed “The Octopus Model.” Operating as a cluster of subsidiaries, rather than a centralized company, drives internal competition, he explained — and it also means that when the company gets in trouble, the trouble often doesn’t go all the way to the top. “Neither Bill Bonner nor Mark Ford [another Agora leader] has ever been arrested or accused of fraud or wrongdoing,” he wrote to conclude his “Octopus Model” description.\n\nBonnie Patten at Truth In Advertising also commented on Agora’s tentacled strategy — but she chose a slightly more colorful creature to compare it to: “Agora is a multi-headed hydra. They have dozens and dozens of publications that they are using to deceive and manipulate consumers.”\n\nIn a text message, Wiggin told Forbes that he thought the Octopus Model “sounds less promising than the ‘free market’ model Agora historically used.” Asked what The Agora’s ‘free market’ model was, Wiggin sent Forbes Google search results for two economists at George Mason University before acknowledging that neither has ever been affiliated with The Agora. Forbes asked Wiggin about The Agora’s specific history with free market principles, to which he replied, “I probably would [share] but I don’t know you.”\n\nWiggin noted that he hadn’t been party to the SEC or FTC lawsuits, and said a message from Forbes was the first he’d heard of Truth in Advertising.\n\nAgora founder Bill Bonner now conducts much of his business — and the occasional Agora retreat — from a chateau in France that he and his wife bought and remodeled in 2009. Since then, Bonner has hosted copywriting events and Agora staff at the chateau. He opened a library in the house for members of The Agora’s “Oxford Club,” and gives those same members the option to rent out the entire property (prices are only visible to Oxford Club members).\n\nIn addition to Bonner’s chateau, The Agora also maintains a burgeoning empire around the world. In the U.K., it has operated under the subsidiary Southbank Research, offering access to many of the same “gurus” it advertises in the US. In India, Agora affiliate EquityMaster offers dozens more newsletters with names like Hidden Treasure, Double Income, and Lazy Millionaire, with prices that reach up to more than a hundred thousand rupees. Additional Agora branches offer similar products in Germany, Japan, Ireland, Australia, and France. The company has also purchased and restored more than a dozen historic buildings in Baltimore, though it expressed plans to sell some of those properties early last year.\n\n“If a Democrat’s in office, sell on fear; if a Republican’s in office, sell on greed.”\n\ninternal Agora slogan\n\nIn the U.S. The Agora’s business has often dabbled in politics. It has rented the email lists of prominent conservative political influencers like Mike Huckabee and Newt Gingrich, and has also employed at least one conservative political figure directly as a guru: Trumpworld figure Sebastian Gorka was among the newsletter authors for Stansberry Research, a former Agora subsidiary, in 2020 and 2021.\n\nLast year, Paradigm Press, another Agora subsidiary, ran ads on Facebook and Instagram depicting Vice President Kamala Harris with devil horns, forcibly injecting children with vaccines. Just days before the election, with voting underway, Agora ads told Americans that actually, the election might be, or might have been, cancelled or postponed — and that, of course, their newsletters would tell you how to capitalize on it.\n\nTwo former Agora employees recalled a slogan that they said was popular in the company’s Baltimore offices: “if a Democrat’s in office, sell on fear; if a Republican’s in office, sell on greed.” The Agora’s publications have expressed varying opinions on the policies of Donald Trump — from comically positive to apocalyptically negative — but they all seem to agree that Trump is good for content.\n\nNot all The Agora’s products have a political angle. In addition to its core copywriting business, The Agora also runs an “administrative services” company, sells “stock screening” software, , and manages a luxury resort in Nicaragua that offers timeshares, holotropic breathwork workshops, and a “Path to Vitality Longevity Experience.” In the course of reporting this story, Forbes set up a new email address to sign up for two free Agora newsletters. Several emails sent to the address promised that attendees of a promoted event would learn a “daily teaspoon secret that crushes” Type 2 diabetes, a “lost arthritis cure shown to reverse pain in 82% of patients,” and a “resurrection” cancer treatment (“15 times more powerful than chemotherapy, radiation and surgery”). The event was free, but it upsold attendees on a $2,460 “Masterplan For Fighting Disease.”\n\nAnother email promotion promised to reveal a “Natural Cancer Flush” which “[S]imply flushes it out. The cancer starts dying off.” Viewers of this promotion are upsold on an “Ultimate Cancer-Defeating Protocol” produced by Dr. Richard Gerhauser, and available for just $279.\n\nThe “Cancer-Defeating Protocol” is not Gerhauser’s first rodeo with The Agora.

Yet recent polls show fewer citizens feel proud of being from this country. \n\nIn fact, only 36% of Democrats say they are “extremely” or “very” proud to be American. Just a year ago, that number was 62%. \n\nThis suggests that whoever sits in the White House has a lot to do with Democrats’ pride in their country. But should it? \n\nThat same poll claims that only 40% of Gen Z (13-28 year-olds) are extremely proud of America, compared with 83% of the Silent Generation (80 and older.) \n\nThis suggests the more you see, the more you come to appreciate the United States. It may well be true that Americans who aren’t proud of their heritage are just Americans who haven’t lived long enough. \n\nBut should it? \n\nPride is a tough thing to lecture others about. People have gripes. People have frustrations. It doesn’t do much good to wag fingers and yell “Be proud!” if that person doesn’t feel it. \n\nBut lacking pride shouldn’t mean lacking gratitude. \n\nSo on this Independence Day weekend, allow me to suggest a few small differences between the two. \n\nAppreciation abounds in America \n\nYou don’t have to be proud of how our forefathers took this land from Native Americans, but you can be grateful that when they did, instead of an authoritarian rule, they at least aspired to create a nation “where all men are created equal.” \n\nYou don’t have to be proud of our historical sublimation of women, but you can be proud of the 19th Amendment, suffrage, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, and the continued ceiling breaking of American women, from Sally Ride to Janet Yellin to Kamala Harris. \n\nYou don’t have to be proud of slavery, but you can be grateful that, despite continued lingering prejudices (that, by the way, exist in all countries) we reached a point where we elected a Black man president and a black woman Vice President, hate crimes based on race are now codified in law, and approval of interracial marriage, which was at 5% in the 1950s, is now 94%. \n\nYou don’t have to be proud of our current immigration battles, but you can be grateful that so many people fighting for the right thing are themselves, either immigrants or children of immigrants, given a chance by this nation’s openness. \n\nYou don’t have to be proud of our current president’s behavior, but you can be grateful that we have a system where he can be fairly elected in, and out, unlike so many nations on this Earth. \n\nSharing, caring can be found \n\nYou don’t have to be proud of the shenanigans of mayors and governors, but you can be grateful for the efforts of first responders, pro-bono lawyers, and hospice volunteers in the United States, who far outnumber politicians. \n\nYou don’t have to be proud of how some leaders flout their religious beliefs, but you can be grateful that whatever church, mosque, synagogue or religious gathering place you attend, you can do so without fear of government reprisal, which is not true in so many other countries. \n\nYou don’t have to be proud of crazy policies in places like New York City or Portland, Oregon, but you can be grateful for places like Asheville, North Carolina, where, after Hurricane Helene last year, the citizens mobilized to share water, food and electricity on their porches, and even set up a medical clinic in a local dive bar. \n\nYou don’t have to proud of the bloat of American sports, but you can be grateful for the Little League games in your local park, or the soccer nets, basketball hoops and playground equipment that countless communities offer for free. \n\nYou don’t have to be proud of our nation’s poor health choices, but you can be grateful you live in a country where you can buy vegan, gluten-free ice cream right next to Ben & Jerry’s Chunky Monkey. \n\nYou don’t have to be proud of how President Donald Trump whips up a military parade, but you can be grateful for small Independence Day gatherings of flags and speeches and food and fireworks. \n\nYou don’t have to be proud of anything having to do with the nation’s foreign policies, economic rules or military actions, but you can be grateful for the freedom you have here to criticize them. \n\nBelieve me, that is hardly the case in much of the world. \n\nPride in this country should not waft and wane based on who gets elected president. We are bigger than that. And, even better, we are smaller than that. We exist not in the Oval Office, but in the cul-de-sac, not on the White House lawn, but under the sprinklers, not in the Situation Room, but in the community center. \n\nThere’s plenty in America that will make you less than proud, if you only look at the TV news. But if you look around instead, there’s plenty more that will make you appreciate it. \n\nSo happy birthday to our nation. It began as an ideal, and despite its many missteps, it remains one. America’s greatest attribute is aspiration. The hope that we will be better tomorrow than today. That alone, given all the alternatives in this world, is reason enough to be grateful to live here. \n\nContact Mitch Albom: malbom@freepress.com.

Hence the phrase.\n\nBrown, politically speaking, did the same thing when as a relatively unknown Republican state senator he came out of nowhere like a bolt of lightning in 2010 to get elected to the U.S. Senate.\n\nHe stormed the state in his beat up old red pickup to upset Democrat Attorney General Martha Coakley, the clear favorite, in heavily Democrat Massachusetts. It was a special election to fill out the Senate term of longtime Sen. Ted Kennedy who had just died.\n\nIt was a startling campaign victory, if not heard around the world, was certainly heard at the White House, then occupied by President Barack Obama.\n\nTwo years later the Democrats backed Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren who, with backing from Obama and the Democrat establishment, defeated Brown for election to a full six-year term.\n\nBrown, married to former Boston television reporter (WCVB-TV) Gail Huff, moved back to New Hampshire where his family has deep roots.\n\nIn 2014 he ran unsuccessfully against incumbent Democrat Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, losing by a mere three points.\n\nNow, after a stint as President Donald Trump’ ambassador to New Zealand, Brown is running again. Only this time the senate seat is open as Shaheen has opted not to seek re-election.\n\nBrown, so far the only Republican running, got into the race after former New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu ruled out a run.\n\nThe lone Democrat running is three term U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, whose claim to fame is that he defeated Republican challenger Karoline Leavitt in 2022.\n\nIt was the best thing that happened to Leavitt since she went on to become Trump’s effective White House press secretary who has more access to the president than Pappas, or any other Democrat, could ever dream of having.\n\nSo, look for Trump to take a keen interest in the Brown campaign, not only because Brown is a supporter and was an ambassador, but he could use his vote in the Senate. Brown also has Leavitt on his side as well.\n\nAlso, New Hampshire has been a sore spot for Trump. He has not carried the state in the three times he has run for president. He lost the state to Hillary Clinton in 2016, to Joe Biden in 2020 and to Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nAll of this took place before Trump, in the short months he has been president the second time around, has developed into one of the most powerful, effective and relevant presidents since the Roosevelt/Truman era.\n\nThe latest example of his leadership is the passage of his big, beautiful bill that all the Democrats opposed.\n\nBefore it passed the House, the Senate approved it on a narrow 51 to 50 vote with all the Democrats, including Shaheen voting against it. Vice President JD Vance was called upon to break the tie.\n\nBrown would have voted for it.\n\nA Brown victory in New Hampshire would be a victory for Trump. Let’s see if lightning strikes twice.\n\nVeteran political reporter Peter Lucas can be reached at: peter.lucas@bostonherald.com","summary":"Look for Trump to take a keen interest in Scott Brown's campaign, not only because Brown is a supporter and was an ambassador, but he could use his vote in the Senate.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/07/07/lucas-the-timing-is-right-for-scott-brown-in-new-hampshire/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25176450221086.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 09:21:55","author":"Peter Lucas","authors":["Peter Lucas"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.019},{"id":339044178,"title":"CBS parent company sparks massive outrage with Trump lawsuit settlement","text":"Paramount Global and CBS’ eight-figure settlement to President Donald Trump has caused widespread outrage across the legal and journalism communities. Paramount Global and CBS agreed on Tuesday to settle Trump’s $20 billion election interference lawsuit against the network. The lawsuit alleged CBS News deceitfully edited a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris in order to make her appear more articulate ahead of Election Day. Many legal experts and Paramount’s own attorneys insisted the lawsuit was meritless, but CBS’ parent company settled it anyway. It is widely believed that Paramount's controlling shareholder Shari Redstone pushed for the settlement in hopes of paving the way for Trump’s FCC to approve a long-planned merger with David Ellison’s Skydance Media. CBS staffers are furious and there has been extensive backlash from media watchdogs, journalism advocacy groups, liberal journalists and even Democratic lawmakers. CBS STAFFERS REVOLT OVER PARAMOUNT'S 'SHAMEFUL' TRUMP SETTLEMENT, 'BETRAYAL' TO THE NETWORK'S JOURNALISTS Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., issued a scathing statement that said the settlement sets an \"extremely dangerous precedent in terms of both the First Amendment and government extortion,\" while Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., accused Paramount of taking a \"bribe\" and threatened future federal charges. Former CNN anchor Jim Acosta said Paramount \"paid a shameful bribe to the President of the United States in order to grease the skids for a media deal that, and there really is no other way to put this, stinks to high heaven.\" The American Civil Liberties Union believes Paramount and CBS \"disgraced themselves\" with the decision. \"President Trump's lawsuit was frivolous. Paramount's capitulation was craven. We've never been more in need of a free and independent press as a check on abuses of power. Instead, Paramount and CBS have disgraced themselves and betrayed the core values of journalism,\" ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project director Ben Wizner said in a statement. The Freedom of the Press Foundation called the settlement a \"dark day\" for press freedom. \"Paramount’s spineless decision to settle Trump’s baseless and patently unconstitutional lawsuit is an insult to the journalists of ‘60 Minutes’ and an invitation to Trump to continue targeting other news outlets. Each time a company cowers and surrenders to Trump’s demands it only emboldens him to do it again,\" FPF director of advocacy Seth Stern wrote. \"It will be remembered as one of the most shameful capitulations by the press to a president in history,\" Stern continued. \"But we are not done fighting.\" PARAMOUNT, CBS FORCED TO PAY EIGHT FIGURES, CHANGE EDITORIAL POLICY IN SETTLEMENT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP The FPF is a Paramount Global shareholder, and Stern is ready to make his voice heard. \"We’ve already filed a shareholder information demand and are sending a second demand today to uncover information about this decision. With that information, we will continue to pursue our legal options to stop this affront to Paramount shareholders, CBS journalists, and the First Amendment. Paramount directors should be held accountable and we will do all we can to make that happen,\" Stern wrote. Famed First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams, who represented The New York Times during the Pentagon Papers case, told the FPF that Paramount’s decision to settle \"is an ominous blow to press freedom in our nation.\" The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), a First Amendment advocacy organization, isn’t pleased with CBS News’ parent company, either. \"Paramount may have closed this case, but it opened the door to the idea that the government should be the media’s editor-in-chief. Trump has a long history of filing frivolous lawsuits to intimidate critics, and his targets have a long history of capitulating to avoid legal headaches. And here, he had the added tactic of using the FCC and its review of the multi-billion-dollar Paramount-Skydance merger to bring added pressure to bear,\" FIRE Chief Counsel Bob Corn-Revere said. \"Behavior that gets rewarded gets repeated,\" Corn-Revere continued. \"This settlement will only embolden the president to continue his flurry of baseless lawsuits against the press — and against the American people’s ability to hear the news free from government intrusion.\" BERNIE SANDERS BLASTS PARAMOUNT, SAYS LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT WILL FURTHER EMBOLDEN TRUMP TO ATTACK MEDIA PEN America, a group that bills itself as standing \"at the intersection of literature and human rights to protect free expression in the United States and worldwide,\" suggested CBS isn't protecting it's journalists. \"Paramount’s decision to settle a meritless lawsuit rather than stand behind its journalists at CBS News is a spineless capitulation,\" PEN America director Tim Richardson said. \"This was a moment to defend press freedom and support reporters targeted by a frivolous legal attack,\" Richardson added. \"Instead, Paramount chose appeasement to bolster its finances, sending a dangerous message that media outlets can be pressured into submission if corporate parents find their profits at risk from government action in unrelated areas.\" Richardson noted ABC also settled a defamation lawsuit in December with then-President-elect Trump for $15 million, after anchor George Stephanopoulos repeatedly and incorrectly asserted Trump had been found \"liable for rape\" in a civil trial last year. ABC additionally paid $1 million for President Trump’s legal fees. \"With two major network owners bowing to the president in quick succession, the danger is clear: emboldened politicians and powerful actors will feel more free than ever to weaponize lawsuits and bring regulatory pressure to bear to silence and censor independent journalism,\" Richardson said. '60 MINUTES' KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW AT CENTER OF TRUMP LAWSUIT RUNS AFOUL OF CRONKITE-ERA CBS GUIDELINES Heritage Foundation Media Fellow Tim Young sees it differently and is \"glad\" they settled but doesn’t feel it will change the way news organizations cover Trump and other public figures they don’t align with. \"This is one of the few times the media has been held accountable. They definitely wouldn’t have settled had Trump not won the election, because Kamala, who they lied to make look good, would have protected them,\" Young told Fox News Digital. \"I’d love to believe that this is a turning point in media accountability, but it won’t be,\" Young continued. \"When you see the dramatic differences in coverage and continuous lies, legacy media networks are showing that they will continue this dishonest behavior.\" Paramount has defended the settlement. \"Companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable costs of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial or reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause. Settlement offers a negotiated resolution that allows companies to focus on their core objectives rather than being mired in uncertainty and distraction,\" a Paramount spokesperson told Fox News Digital. Fox News Digital has learned that the sum being paid to Trump could reach north of $30 million, with $16 million being paid upfront for his future presidential library, in addition to another eight-figure allocation set aside for advertisements, public service announcements, or other similar transmissions, in support of conservative causes by the network in the future. Current Paramount management disputes the additional allocation, and a source familiar with Paramount's current leadership told Fox New Digital only $16 million was sanctioned by the official mediator, and they have no knowledge of any deal Trump made with incoming owner, Skydance Media. However, the incoming ownership will be responsible for the additional allocation. Redstone recused herself from settlement negotiations in February. As part of the agreement, CBS News did not admit to any wrongdoing nor issue an apology. The network did agree to update its editorial standards by mandating the release of full, unedited transcripts of interviews with future presidential candidates.

Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit.

President Trump will always ensure that no one gets away with lying to the American People as he continues on his singular mission to Make America Great Again,\" a spokesperson for Trump’s legal team told Fox News Digital.

Having already toured versions of the show across the US as part of Projectorfest, SOLOCOM and the New York City Fringe, Hornedo arrives in Edinburgh with plenty of buzz. A selection from the show is being featured on PBS’s Stories From the Stage and will be airing on television stations across the US. But it’s the raw, cinematic storytelling that truly sets Hornedo apart. Blending stand-up with confessional comedy, Watch This When You Get Home is a coming-of-age tale about love, longing and the hopelessly high expectations we set for ourselves when we grow up believing life should feel like a film. From a terrifying first kiss in a recreation of the swamp from Shrek, to a masochistic schoolboy crush involving insults and actual kicks to the groin, to the ill-judged break-up video he once gave to his high school girlfriend on an SD card [with the now-iconic line, \"watch this when you get home\"], Hornedo mines the moments most people would rather forget and turns them into painfully funny reflections on romance and regret. Now based in Brooklyn, Hornedo is originally from Laredo, Texas and grew up in Indianapolis. He graduated from Harvard in 2019 where he studied Government and Theatre. He’s a two-time Moth SLAM winner and a regular on the New York comedy scene, with appearances at The Bell House, Upright Citizens Brigade and his own show Campfire Tales, which has featured comedians from Saturday Night Live, Comedy Central and NPR. His comedy has been spotlighted in Vulture, McSweeney’s, Pod Save America and Points In Case. On social media, his shorts have racked up over a million views. Before going into comedy full-time, Hornedo worked in American politics, producing social media content for Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 presidential campaign and for Kamala Harris during President Biden’s campaign.

Raúl Grijalva, known for his strong advocacy on behalf of environmental, immigrant, and Native American issues, and he was a prominent figure in progressive politics.\n\nDespite his tendency to take firm but often unsuccessful stands, he played a leading role among progressive lawmakers and easily overcame Republican opposition until his career concluded with his passing in March at the age of 77.\n\nNow, his daughter is one of several Democrats aiming to succeed him in the 7th Congressional District, while three Republicans are competing for the GOP nomination in the July 15 primary. The winners will compete in the Sept. 23 general election.\n\nSix of Arizona’s nine U.S. House members are Republican. But the 7th District is a Democratic stronghold, so much so that national Republicans don’t talk about picking it up, said pollster Mike O’Neil. It stretches across most of the state’s border with Mexico and includes parts of Tucson and nearby counties.\n\nStill, the GOP candidates are holding out hope for change for the first time in 22 years.\n\nHere’s a look at the candidates:\n\nA handful of Democratic hopefuls\n\nAdelita Grijalva, who served on local governing boards, is regarded as the frontrunner. The Democratic candidates also include former state lawmaker Daniel Hernandez, who is credited with helping save then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords’ life when she was shot outside a Tucson grocery store in 2011.\n\nDigital strategist and reproductive rights advocate Deja Foxx, Indigenous activist and scholar Jose Malvido Jr. and retired health care executive Patrick Harris Sr. round out the field.\n\nAll but one of the Democrats — Hernandez — said they oppose a massive copper mining project in the district that environmentalists and Native American tribes say will decimate the landscape and destroy sacred sites. Hernandez said environmental protection and job creation can happen simultaneously.\n\nThe Democrats’ policy stances otherwise are similar in denouncing President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdowns as cruel. Cuts to Medicaid and Medicare will hurt residents and rural hospitals, they say. \n\nAdelita Grijalva, whose values she says align with her father’s, pushed back against notions she’s an establishment candidate.\n\n“In more than two decades of public service to Arizona, I have a record of my own,” Grijalva said. \n\nHernandez, a former congressional candidate in a neighboring district, touted his advocacy for gun violence survivors and transgender rights. He said he’s not worried about the GOP flipping the 7th District because of its working class and Latino electorate. \n\nFoxx, who at 25 is the youngest Democratic candidate, has shared that her life story includes government housing, subsidized health care and food assistance while being raised by a single mother in Tucson. \n\nShe led influencer strategy for Kamala Harris’ 2020 presidential campaign. “You can expect me to be outspoken, to be an obstructionist to Donald Trump” if elected, she said.\n\nMalvido has spoken out against the killings of Palestinians in the Israel-Hamas war, believes the United States needs to preserve the separation of powers and wants to reconnect with working class voters. \n\nPatrick Harris has proposed setting a national wealth threshold of $1 billion and taxing the excess if it’s not reinvested or donated within a year to keep the American dream within reach. \n\nTrio of Latinos vie for GOP nod\n\nThe Republicans in the running generally favor Trump’s immigration crackdown, though painting company owner Daniel Butierez objected to enforcement around schools and churches. Off-road vehicle businessman Jimmy Rodriguez says he’s open to immigrants filling jobs in the farming and construction industries, as long as they’re not convicted criminals. \n\nButierez and restaurant owner Jorge Rivas support Trump’s bill of tax breaks and funding cuts but share concerns with Democrats about losing health care funding. \n\nButierez’s path to political life has been unconventional. He was imprisoned in a drug case but was found to have been wrongly convicted. He credited religion for turning his life around and said his experiences in life and his business sense make him suited to serve in Congress. \n\n“I believe there’s going to be a shift,” said Butierez, who captured 36% of the vote in the 2024 election against Raúl Grijalva. “I actually believe it’s going to be a complete upset.” \n\nRivas immigrated to the United States when his native El Salvador was embroiled in a civil war in the 1980s. He started serving meals from a food wagon and now operates a Mexican restaurant as a U.S. citizen. He said his success came from hard work and a little luck. \n\n“I know how bad things can get when you don’t have the right people in power,” he said.\n\nRodriguez, who ran for Congress in Vermont in 2020, said he was inspired to seek public office after enduring hardships following the loss of his 19-year-old son who was hit while photographing an off-road race in Nevada.\n\nThree years later, he pleaded guilty to making a false statement to a government agency and was sentenced to five years of probation in Arizona. He said he’s owned the mistake and is making amends.\n\n“I really want to be the representative that I needed back when I went through all this with my son, and I think I’m capable,” he said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPHOENIX – For more than 20 years, southern Arizona&#8217;s congressional seat was&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Arizona&#8217;s Solidly Blue Congressional Seat is Open: Who Will Succeed Raúl Grijalva? first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/arizonas-solidly-blue-congressional-seat-is-open-who-will-succeed-raul-grijalva/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Deep-blue-Arizona-congressional-district-is-up-for-grabs-Who-will.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 04:13:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.322},{"id":338968512,"title":"Democrats have a Hispanic voter problem","text":"The Hispanic drift away from Democrats included men and women at nearly the same rate. Hispanic men and women supported Trump in 2024 by 50% and 46%, respectively. This was a 13-point gain for Trump with Hispanic women relative to 2020 and defied election forecasts. A Pew poll from September 2024 showed Harris with a 21-point lead over Trump with this group.\n\nThe new data also reveal an intensity gap between Republican and Democratic Hispanic supporters: 86% of Trump’s 2020 Hispanic supporters voted in 2024 compared to only 77% of former President Joe Biden’s 2020 Hispanic voters. New Hispanic voters also broke hard for Trump. Among Hispanic eligible voters who did not vote in 2020 but did vote in 2024, 60% voted for Trump, while only 37% voted for Harris.\n\nDemocrats also hemorrhaged votes among young Hispanics in 2024, suggesting their troubles with the group will continue for a long time. In 2020, 73% of Hispanics under 30 voted for Biden, but only 57% voted for Harris.\n\nThe cause for the Hispanic drift toward the GOP is easily understood. Like most Americans, Hispanic people increasingly dislike the party’s left-wing policies, especially on the economy and immigration.\n\nHispanic and black voters are more likely to feel the pinch of inflation than their white and Asian counterparts. The Democratic Party’s inflationary policies, including the preposterously named Inflation Reduction Act signed by Biden, poisoned the Democratic brand for Hispanics. Two-thirds of Hispanic voters considered the economy to be in poor shape in 2024 and claimed to be less financially secure than in previous years. Meanwhile, Hispanic trust in Trump’s ability to manage the economy, other than in the early days of COVID-19, increased over time.\n\nGrowing Hispanic support for Trump’s immigration program and diminishing support for the Democrats’ chaotic open border policies also play a pivotal role. A Pew study from June found that 42% of Hispanic voters favor building more of the U.S. border wall, up from 24% in 2019. Similarly, a 2024 Axios poll found 45% of Hispanic voters saying they support mass deportations of illegal immigrants.\n\nHispanic voters in border counties have sprinted away from the Democrats. In 2016, Trump lost Starr County, Texas, which is preponderantly Hispanic, by 60 points to Hillary Clinton. But in 2024, he won it by 16 points, a 76-point swing in the course of eight years. Trump’s win in Starr County was the first by a Republican since 1896.\n\nWHY ZOHRAN MAMDANI SUCCEEDED WHERE KAMALA HARRIS FAILED\n\nNaturalized citizens, immigrants who have attained U.S. citizenship, have also abandoned the Democratic Party on immigration. Today, they trust Republicans more on the issue by 8 points, a 40-point swing from only four years ago. The Democrats’ racist expectation that legal Hispanic citizens would prioritize their ethnic affiliation with many illegal immigrants instead of the rule of law and safety backfired.\n\nResponding to the needs of Hispanic voters who say they want financial stability and safe communities would allow Democrats to stop the bleeding. But recent events, including the Democrats’ embrace of illegal immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia and the cheap stunt performed by Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) at Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s press conference in Los Angeles, mean Democrats still have a long way to go before they reach rock bottom in support by Hispanic voters.","summary":"The “demographics is destiny” theory pushed by Obama-era Democrats is being rapidly exposed for the racist sham it always was.

Paramount has since agreed to pay Trump US$16 million to end the saga.\n\nBut Paramount weren’t buyers. They were sellers — of their own integrity and of the ethical principles of journalism that were once the core value proposition of commercial media. It’s the end of any pretence that the billionaire class has — or aspires to have — any role to play in the moral economy of legacy news.\n\nIt’s no surprise that the morality of oligarch-owners of American — and much of our — news media has a price. The shock is just how cheaply they value themselves, with CBS tossing in the towel rather than fighting a case that Harvard Law Professor Noah Feldman on CBS News itself called “so ill-grounded that it comes close to being sanctionable as frivolous”. \n\nPlenty of the company’s journalists aren’t having it. In May, CBS News head Wendy McMahon followed 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens out the door, saying diplomatically: “The company and I do not agree on the path forward.” Others are leaving in the now-regular mass media tradition of managing decline through job cuts, including at Ten here in Australia, as shown by its axing of The Project. \n\nFrivolous lawfare? That’s Trump’s music playing. His genius is in knowing just how easy it is to play media and information companies to maximise the return in humiliation while still picking up a few stray million to pad out his Presidential Library account. Turns out it’s $US16 million each from Paramount and Disney’s ABC network, $US10 million from Twitter, and $US25 million from Meta.\n\nSome media-related billionaires have found more direct ways to humbly kowtow to the president and his family, including Jeff Bezos’ Prime Media deal to pay Melania Trump $US40 million for the rights to tell her story through Amazon Prime. \n\nTrump’s people are eager to make it clear that the humiliation of the CBS loser was the point: “President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people … holds the fake news media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit …no-one gets away with lying to the American people.” \n\nPublicly, Paramount (and the other oligarch-owned media settling up with Trump) is happy to let you know it’s only doing it for the money, blathering about that noxious old saw “shareholder interests”. And, sure, it’s always going to be cheaper to pay out a few stray millions up front than get stuck paying much more for what threatens to be never-ending legal costs, particularly given the uncertainties of the US courts under Trump.\n\nAnd, looked at from the purely Redstone billionaire standpoint, it must be good to have the path cleared to offloading the family’s controlling interest in Paramount through a merger with Skydance, owned by David Ellison, son of the world’s second-richest man and Trump buddy Larry Ellison (also speculated as the likely owner of TikTok if Trump can wrest it out of Chinese control).\n\nBut Trump’s shakedowns of US media owners are not just a remake of that old media story about the shuffling ownership of broadcast licenses and dollars. Rather, we’re seeing the end of something big: the century-long incubation of ethical journalism within mass commercial media. It was a powerful symbiosis where media moguls raked in the rivers-of-gold advertising in exchange for hosting journalism’s political truth-telling — all that verification, deliberation and accountability, however imperfectly done, that sustains a democratic society.\n\nPart of the cost of the hosting privilege came from standing up for the journalism — fighting cases, both for their own sake and to discourage other would-be plaintiffs, much like Nine had to do in the Ben Roberts-Smith case at an estimated cost of $30 million. Lucky for Nine it won the case, leaving Australia’s own media oligarch Kerry Stokes to pick up much of Nine’s tab.\n\nNow it seems, the old media hosts have decided that all those journalists — with their highfalutin ethics — are simply unnecessary. Far better, like News Corp, to lean into those more reliable large language models — to “enhance” workflow, of course. \n\nAs a political story, the Trump clap-back at media owners reads a lot like the all-too-common pattern of autocrats acting to consolidate news media in the hands of oligarch allies — as has Orban in Hungary, or Erdoğan in Turkiye, with excessive fines on news media that step out of line. \n\nWelcome to Trump’s mafia state, Putin biographer and New York Times writer Masha Gessen said in April: “an absolutely centralised system in which one person, the patron, the don, distributes money and power”. \n\nNow in mass media, too.","summary":"With a US$16 million payout from Paramount Global, Donald Trump has shown how easily he can force media giants to kowtow to his wishes.\n\n\nThe post Welcome to Trump’s media world, where moguls pay up at the cost of ethical journalism appeared first on Crikey.","url":"https://www.crikey.com.au/2025/07/07/donald-trump-paramount-cbs-media-lawfare/","image":"https://www.crikey.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/Trump-Paramount_1680x945_2.jpg?quality=70&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 00:19:00","author":"Christopher Warren","authors":["Christopher Warren"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":338912416,"title":"Christian, ‘tradpop’ music making ‘a comeback’ as conservative ideals become more popular: report","text":"Faith-based and “traditional” pop hits are surging on the music charts this year, as noted in a recent report.\n\nAlex Warren’s “Ordinary,” “a folksy melodramatic ballad about faith and love,” according to Semafor, was the No. 1 song in the country this week and has been on Billboard’s Hot 100 for the past 20 weeks.\n\nThe song’s popularity isn’t an oddity. Several Christian and country artists have also ranked high on the music charts this year, the report said, indicating a “political vibe shift” in American pop music since President Donald Trump took office.\n\nIt stands in stark contrast to the 2024 “brat summer” trend, embraced by former Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, where boundary-pushing female pop stars Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan and Charli XCX dominated the music scene, Semafor reported.\n\nChristian artists Brandon Lake and Forrest Frank have also enjoyed more mainstream success. Lake’s “Hard Fought Hallelujah” is now in its 19th week on the Billboard Hot 100 and Frank’s “Your Way’s Better” hit its 10th week on the chart.\n\n“Christian music is making a serious comeback,” Billboard reported in May after the two Christian songs became the first faith-based hits in 11 years to make it on the Hot 100 chart.\n\nCountry star Morgan Wallen is also wildly popular, having several hits on the Hot 100. His recently released album, “I’m the Problem,” broke streaming records in May. Thomas Rhett, Jelly Roll and Shaboozey also have country-pop hits topping the charts.\n\nOn “American Idol” this season, several contestants were open about their faith. The show also hosted a three-hour “Songs of Faith” special on Easter Sunday where contestants and judges performed gospel and worship music.\n\nPop music seems to be reflecting a broader cultural shift toward traditional and conservative ideals, Semafor reported.\n\nAs conservative voices and positions become more influential with Trump’s return to office, companies and institutions have responded in kind by ditching Pride Month campaigns and DEI priorities, the report noted. It can also be seen in the online “trad wife” trend, where young women embrace marriage and traditional values.\n\nSeveral Gen Z women who spoke to Fox News Digital at a Turning Point USA conference this year said it was important to them to defend strong traditional values that were grounded in faith and femininity. \n\n“Holding up values, traditional values that come from the Bible and be able to carry those throughout every aspect of life, to be able to create a foundation for yourself and your family that carries out the Lord’s message,” Grace from Florida told Fox about what it means to be a conservative.","summary":"Faith-based and \"traditional\" pop hits are surging on the music charts this year, as noted in a recent report.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/06/entertainment/christian-tradpop-music-making-a-comeback-as-conservative-ideals-become-more-popular-report/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/forrest-frank-performs-coca-cola-107727634.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-06 22:16:28","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.391},{"id":338907504,"title":"Andy Beshear confirms he’s eyeing 2028 as he polls high with Republicans in deep red Kentucky","text":"Kentucky’s governor Andy Beshear delivered a ray of hope for Democrats worried about their party’s bench of future national talent on Sunday as he confirmed that a 2028 run for president is something that is on his radar.\n\nBeshear appeared on CNN’s State of the Union, where the red-state governor confirmed that his thinking on the issue had changed over the past few years.\n\n“If you’d asked me this question a couple years ago, I would have said no. My family’s been through a lot, but I do not want to leave a broken country to my kids, or anyone else’s,” said the governor.\n\n“So what I think is most important for a candidate for 2028 is a candidate that can heal this country, that can bring people back together. So when I sit down, I’m going to think about whether I’m that candidate, or whether someone else is that candidate,” he continued.\n\nBeshear’s appeal as a national candidate for the party is obvious, given his popularity as a Democratic governor in a state with two Republican senators and a record of going red in presidential races. His ability to win over moderate Democratic voters and independents especially is something the party is eager to reclaim after Kamala Harris’s devastating defeat in 2024.\n\nBeshear’s second term as governor term will also end in December of 2027, making the timing of a presidential run achievable while also completing the entirety of his four years in office.\n\nStaffers at the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) may be breathing a second sigh of relief on Sunday after his interview, given that a competitive Republican primary is already broiling over who will replace the retiring Senator Mitch McConnell, formerly leader of the GOP Senate caucus. The lack of an incumbent in the seat gives Beshear a clear opening were he to run, especially given his proven ability to win independent and even Republican support in his past races. He also maintains a high approval rating, and is one of the most popular governors nationwide.\n\nHe has no interest in serving in the Senate, however, a spokesman said in February. \n\nBeshear also maintains one other key advantage were he to run in a Democratic primary: he is not tainted by association to the Biden administration or either the former president or Harris’s successive doomed presidential campaigns. Beshear did hit the campaign trail to support Harris over the summer of 2024, but his distance from the White House frees him from the stink of the controversy surrounding Biden’s physical and mental decline over the course of his presidency.\n\nHarris herself is widely reported to be eyeing a run for governor of California, but at the same time continues to avoid the press. She has not sat down for an interview with a national news outlet since the election, and has only delivered public remarks once this year in April.\n\nAs well as Harris, Beshear’s potential rivals for the 2028 nomination include ex-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, known for being one of the Biden administration’s most skilled communicators, as well as California’s current governor: Gavin Newsom, who has been a figure of leadership in his party in the second “Resistance” era.\n\nThe Kentucky governor will take over chairmanship of the Democratic Governors Association next year, putting him in charge of a key campaign arm for the party and giving him a chance to make important political alliances should he consider a future bid for office.","summary":"“If you’d asked me this question a couple years ago, I would have said no,” the Kentucky governor said.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/andy-beshear-2028-democrat-kentucky-b2783660.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/06/21/07/beshear_cnnsotu_725.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/4wKkErLg-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-06 22:14:11","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.062}]}
