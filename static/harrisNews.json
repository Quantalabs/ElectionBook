The committee was originally founded by members of the entertainment industry in the 1940s as a way to push back against Hollywood blacklisting during the McCarthy era. Fonda, whose father, Henry Fonda, was an original member, told CNN’s Dana Bash she hoped to revive that same spirit of unity against former President Donald Trump. \"No president has ever sent troops into the Democratic cities across the country saying full force,\" Fonda said. \"No president, as far as I know, has tried to control the Federal Reserve, the central bank. He is amassing power in a way that will destroy our democracy. And so we‘re going to stand up. We‘re creatives. We‘re storytellers. We can do it creatively. We can have a good time while we do it.\" JIMMY KIMMEL CANCELLATION SPARKS FIERCE CELEBRITY SPLIT IN HOLLYWOOD Fonda said her group grew rapidly after launching earlier that day, adding that she is also focused on electing new Democratic leaders. \"We‘re going to have a good group, and we‘re going to have fun doing it,\" Fonda said. \"But I also have a PAC, a climate PAC that elects people all over the country because I don‘t feel that our leaders are doing what they need to do. And if you can‘t change the people, change the people. That‘s what we‘re doing.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the Democratic National Committee for comment. HOLLYWOOD FINDS FAILURE TO ELECT KAMALA HARRIS 'UNSETTLING': 'NOT THE DRIVER ANYMORE' According to the committee’s website, nearly 600 Hollywood stars and filmmakers have joined in support, including Natalie Portman, Aaron Sorkin, Spike Lee, Viola Davis, Pedro Pascal, Ben Stiller, Whoopi Goldberg, Sean Penn, John Legend, Damon Lindelof, Julianne Moore, Barbra Streisand, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Ethan Hawke and Rosie O’Donnell. In a statement, Fonda highlighted the importance of standing against what she called the \"forces of repression\" in the federal government and its \"coordinated campaign to silence critics.\" HOLLYWOOD INSIDERS SAY TRUMP'S RETURN HAS A CHILLING EFFECT ON FILM INDUSTRY \"We know there is power in solidarity and strength in numbers,\" the statement read. \"We will stand together—fiercely united—to defend free speech and expression from this assault.

That is why we urge every American who cares about the First Amendment—the cornerstone of our democracy—and every artist around the globe who looks to the United States as a beacon of freedom to join us.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It concluded, \"And to those who profit from our work while threatening the livelihoods of everyday working people, bowing to government censorship, and cowering to brute intimidation: we see you, and history will not forget.

Earlier this year, probationary employees, or those who are newly in their position, were among the first to be fired. \n\nLast week, OMB sent a memo to agencies asking them to prepare plans for a reduction in force if the government were to shut down, specifically considering axing employees working in programs that lose funding during a shutdown or those not consistent with Trump’s agenda. \n\nHistorically, during shutdowns, nonessential federal employees will be furloughed – or asked to stop working without pay until the government returns. \n\nBut the Trump administration’s move to fully lay off those employees during a shutdown is a significantly more aggressive move.\n\nVice President JD Vance told reporters Wednesday that the administration would “have to lay some people off” as the shutdown continues – though there is no rule that suggests the administration must do this. \n\n“We don’t necessarily want to do it,” Vance told reporters. “But we’re going to do what we have to keep the American people’s essential services continuing to run.”\n\nDuring a shutdown, essential services such as the postal service, Social Security payments, Medicaid, Medicare, national security, and domestic safety all remain functioning. However, some employees, such as those working in air traffic control, do not get paid for the time the government is shut down. They’re paid back when the government reopens. \n\nIt is just one of the multiple strategies the administration is using to pressure Democrats into voting for the Republicans’ temporary funding bill, called a continuing resolution, that would fund the government as is until November. \n\nThe administration has manipulated resources at its disposal to blame Democrats for the shutdown, including changing government website banners to explicitly point fingers at the liberal party, having agencies send emails to federal employees blaming Democrats, and using prominent voices to go on talk shows to repeat those points.\n\nVought said the administration would remove $8 billion in clean energy funding to 16 states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and $18 billion for New York City’s infrastructure projects.\n\nDemocratic leaders in Congress have brushed off those threats, pointing out that the administration has been doing similar things since Trump took office. \n\n“These are all things that the Trump administration has been doing since January 20th,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters.","summary":"Democrats have brushed off pressure from the administration to comply with Republicans’ temporary funding bill","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/federal-workforce-firing-shutdown-russell-vought-b2837628.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/01/20/40/SEI268261610.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/nBwsgy0p-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-01 21:21:05","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.309},{"id":365303514,"title":"Declined: Trump suffers Supreme Court blow","text":"Deals of the Week\n10:23PMWednesday, October 1st, 2025\n\nIn the know quiz\n\nSet your local weather \n\nBreaking News\n\nCourts & Law\n\nCourts & Law\n\nCourts & Law\n\nCourts & Law\n\nSouth Australia\n\nWestern Australia\n\nNorthern Territory\n\nBreaking News\n\nNorth America\n\nUS Politics\n\nSouth America\n\nMiddle East\n\nUK Politics\n\nHealth Problems\nMental Health\n\nInspiration\nWeight Loss\n\nSchool Life\n\nRestaurants & Bars\nFood Warnings\n\nRelationships\n\nThe Sealed Section\n\nFamily & Friends\n\nFashion Shows\n\nFashion Trends\n\nFace & Body\nCosmetic Surgery\n\nTrue Stories\n\nLifestyle Videos\n\nTravel Ideas\n\nShort Breaks\n\nFood & Drinks\n\nDestinations\n\nNorth America\n\nNew Zealand\n\nMiddle East\nCentral America\nSouth America\n\nTravel Advice\n\nTips & Tricks\n\nAccommodation\n\nAustralian Holidays\n\nNorthern Territory\n\nSouth Australia\n\nWestern Australia\n\nTravel Videos\nEntertainment\n\nCelebrity Life\n\nHook Ups & Break ups\nCelebrity Photos\nCelebrity Kids\nCelebrity Deaths\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nMorning Shows\nCurrent Affairs\n\nUpcoming Movies\n\nMovies Reviews\n\nMusic Festivals\n\nBooks & Magazines\n\nGolden Globes\n\nEntertainment Videos\n\nSocial Media\n\nMobile Phones\n\nHome Entertainment\n\nArchaeology\n\nEnvironment\n\nClimate Change\nSustainability\nNatural Wonders\n\nMotoring News\n\nOn the Road\n\nTechnology Videos\n\nCost of Living\n\nHow to Save\n\nSalary Secrets\nPersonal Finance\n\nSuperannuation\n\nAustralian Culture\nPower & Influence\n\nInside Parliament\n\nGig Economy\n\nBreaking News\n\nManufacturing\n\nOther Industries\n\nAustralian Economy\nWorld Economy\nInterest Rates\nFederal Budget\n\nAustralian Markets\nWorld Markets\nAustralian Dollar\nCryptocurrency\n\nReal Estate\n\nSydney & NSW\nMelbourne & VIC\nAdelaide & SA\n\nCricket Live Scores\n\nV8 Supercars\n\nSports Life\n\nAmerican Sports\n\nParalympics\n\nHorse Racing\n\nExpert Opinion\n\nMore Sports\n\nSport Videos\n\nSales & Deals\n\nHome & Appliances\n\nHealth & Wellbeing\n\nNorth America\nUs Politics\n\nUS politics live: Trump suffers Supreme Court blow\nAs the US government shuts down, the Supreme Court has weighed in on a Donald Trump demand and he may not be happy.\nBenedict Brook in the US\n\nless than 2 min read\nOctober 2, 2025 - 3:48AM\n\nShare via Email\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare on Whatsapp\n\nCopied URL to clipboard\n\nDonald Trump says there are now “two N-words”\n\nDonald Trump spoke to military leaders shockingly telling them to use US sites as “training grounds’. But a “N-word” comment perplexed.\n\nWelcome to US politics and Shutdown day 1 in America. \nWith a budget not passed by the divided Congress, it’s the first US government shutdown since 2018 – during Donald Trump’s first term. \nBut don’t worry, Donald Trump will still be paid, as will politicians. But hundreds of thousands of other government staff will not and will have to wait for the shutdown to end for back pay. \nWhile essential government services – like social security, defence and air traffic control – will remain, others will close. \n\nCopied URL to clipboard\n\nSecretary of War takes aim at America's \"fat\" military\n\nPete Hegseth Declares War on \"Fat Generals\" and \"Woke Garbage\"\n\nOne analyst said for the government to reopen massive compromise would be needed on each side and “we can’t know for sure where all of this is going to end”.\nIn seemingly a petty move by the Trump White House, it has “put on hold” $27 billion of federal funding to New York State. The two most senior Democrats are New Yorkers. \n\nThe US Government has now shutdown all but essential services. (Photo by Brendan SMIALOWSKI / AFP)\nElsewhere, the US president has suffered at least a temporary Supreme Court blow in his attempts to fire a Federal Reserve governor. \nThe court will look into the case of Lisa Cook but not until January with verdict unlikely before June of next year. But it has declined Mr Trump’s demand she be relieved of her role while the case takes place. Ms Cook can keep her job denying Mr Trump the ability to install a new governor more likely to do his bidding. \nRead on for more updates. \n\nRead related topics:Donald Trump\n\nMore related stories\n\nKamala Harris to touch down in Aus\nMore than a year on from her failed presidential campaign, Kamala Harris is set to arrive in Australia to speak at a three-day summit.\n\nUS Politics\nHuge US figure announces visit to Australia\nA major US political figure has announced plans to headline one of the biggest events of the year.\n\n‘Heads up’: Leaked text rocks Trump team\nA leaked text message snapped on the phone of a top Trump official has revealed internal concerns about China taking advantage of major US bailout.\n\nRegistration\n\nIn The Know Quiz\nNewsletters\nCompetitions\n\nWelcome to news.com.au\n\nCode of Conduct\n\nHelp and Support\n\nGeneral Feedback\nAdvertise with us\nStandards of Practice\n\nLicensing & Reprints\n\nOur News Network\n\nThe Daily Telegraph\n\nThe Courier Mail\n\nOur Partners\n\nrealestate.com.au\n\nCODE Sports\n\nA NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

Soon after former President Joe Biden suspended his re-election campaign, The Daily Mail reported that Emhoff's first marriage ended following an affair with his children's nanny. Emhoff confirmed the affair soon after the news broke last year, and in the book, Harris lamented that \"hurtful and degrading comments are, sadly, part and parcel of running for office these days.\" \"Where it crosses the line is when opponents go after family members,\" Harris wrote, adding, \"Of course, I knew about this. Doug had told me about it when we were dating. We disclosed it during my vetting for VP.\" Harris applauded her husband, whom she introduced in her book as \"My Dougie,\" for handling it \"like the mensch that he is, issuing a statement taking responsibility and expressing regret.\" KAMALA HARRIS MENTIONS MICHELLE OBAMA ONLY THREE TIMES IN 300-PAGE BOOK. HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID \"Sadly,\" Harris said, families are not off limits when running for president. Later in the book, Harris described \"one of those fights that every married couple had,\" just weeks before Election Day, after Emhoff repurposed an anniversary present for her birthday and then didn't hear her shouting for a towel from the bath. KAMALA HARRIS PLAYS UP COZY RELATIONSHIP WITH HILLARY CLINTON AS WEDGE WITH BIDEN WIDENS \"I called Doug to ask him to bring me one. No answer. He was in the other room, watching the Dodgers eliminate the Mets in the playoffs. He couldn't hear me over the television. I called his phone,\" Harris wrote in the book. When Emhoff answered casually, asking, \"What's up?\" she described it as a \"bridge too far,\" prompting a fight fueled by the stress that \"had finally gotten to both of us.\" The former vice president said she was \"looking forward to a special evening with Doug\" on her birthday and was hoping he had planned something. \"Doug had been keeping his own grueling schedule and had flown in from a campaign event in Michigan. He was tired and pre-occupied,\" Harris said, while complaining that he hadn't put any thought into the hotel they were staying at that night or what they would have for dinner. \"It turned out to be a bland establishment whose red-and-black decor looked like it hadn't been redone since the '70s. The only distinguished feature of the room was its larger size, but the curtains were broken,\" Harris complained in her book. Harris said her husband \"stopped the argument cold,\" reminding the presidential candidate, \"We can't turn on each other.\" \"With the hits coming from every direction, we have to stay united,\" Harris wrote. \"Back-to-back, swords raised against all outside attacks. We had to protect each other, be each other's pillars of strength, givers and receivers of patience and unconditional love.\" Like many political couples, unconfirmed rumors have swirled since she lost the election that Harris and Emhoff could get divorced. But after their fight, Harris described how she started to find notes on her pillow \"in Doug's chicken scratch, telling me how much he loved me.\" The day after Harris' birthday, her social secretary, Storm Horncastle, told Emhoff, \"Mr. Second Gentleman, you have to fix this,\" Harris wrote. \"She handed him a set of note cards. She'd numbered them one through five, for the nights we'd be apart through the end of the campaign. She instructed him to write a note on each one,\" Harris wrote. Emhoff has two children from his first marriage, Cole and Ella, who famously refer to the former vice president as \"Momala.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Harris said her best friend introduced them, admitting she \"had kissed a lot of frogs before fate\" brought her Emhoff. She described in the book how \"politics isn't built for male spouses.\" \"In D.C., there are long-standing social structures and well-understood roles for wives. Not for the very few husbands,\" she said in the book. Harris' office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the divorce rumors.","summary":"Former Vice Preisdent Kamala Harris described a fight with second gentleman Doug Emhoff during her presidential campaign in her new book, &quot;107 Days&quot; about the 2024 election.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-book-reveals-marital-rift-doug-emhoff-during-campaign","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/kamala-harris-doug-emhoff-campaign.png","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6380063841112","publish_date":"2025-10-01 19:49:04","author":"Deirdre Heavey","authors":["Deirdre Heavey"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.008},{"id":365307294,"title":"Trump administration cancels nearly $8 billion in climate funding to blue states: Vought","text":"\"More info to come from @ENERGY,\" wrote Vought, referring to the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nVought said that the projects affected by the decision are in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.\n\nIn the 2024 election, President Donald Trump lost those states to then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee whom he defeated in the Electoral College.\n\nCNBC has requested comment from the DOE.","summary":"The announcement came on the first day of the federal government shutdown.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/trump-green-new-deal-funding-states-vought.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108206621-1759342648593-gettyimages-2237801812-US_GOV_FUNDING.jpeg?v=1759342673","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 19:42:54","author":"Dan Mangan","authors":["Dan Mangan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.094},{"id":365309796,"title":"Washington Post's new opinion chief says ‘tough decisions about staffing’ are looming","text":"FIRST ON FOX – Washington Post opinion editor Adam O'Neal on Wednesday informed colleagues that \"tough decisions about staffing\" are looming, while reiterating social media guidelines and announcing a trio of new opinion writers. O'Neal, who joined The Post in July after being selected to carry out the paper's billionaire owner Jeff Bezos’ mission statement to promote \"personal liberties and free markets,\" sent a memo to opinion staffers that detailed the next steps of his plan to overhaul the opinion section. \"We’ve already started the hard work of making our workflows more nimble when publishing editorials, op-eds and columns. Soon we will introduce a new org chart that will require us to make tough decisions about staffing. While it is never easy, restructuring the page is critical to making the opinion section more competitive and capable,\" O'Neal wrote in the memo obtained by Fox News Digital. EDITORIAL OVERHAUL: WASHINGTON POST'S NEW OPINION CHIEF FEELS THE WEIGHT OF THE CHALLENGES AHEAD \"In the past, our columnists often served as a rapid-response team to breaking news. Unsigned editorials, on the other hand, stood outside the news cycle. Recently we have increased the number of unsigned editorials and have emphasized speed while improving quality,\" he continued. \"We will eventually begin to publish three editorials a day, and our columnists will begin writing on scheduled days. Together these changes can help give our section a more distinct voice and help readers form habits around consuming our content.\" O’Neal also announced three new hires. National Review economics editor Dominic Pino, The Spectator U.S. deputy editor Kate Andrews and Boston Globe columnist Carine Hajjar will all join The Post next month and report to deputy opinion editor James Hohmann. All three currently work for or have backgrounds with right-leaning publications, a noteworthy development given the paper's historically left-leaning opinion roster. \"We’ll have more announcements in the coming months as we continue hiring contributors with diverse backgrounds to strengthen our section,\" O’Neal wrote. JEFF BEZOS' TENURE AS WASHINGTON POST OWNER IN SPOTLIGHT AS PAPER GRAPPLES WITH LOW MORALE, STAFFER EXODUS O’Neal recently told Fox News Digital that the current state of the editorial pages was a \"work in progress\" and reshaping them would take time. He conceded the paper’s readers are \"overwhelmingly liberal\" from a handful of blue states and hopes to expand its reach with a non-partisan approach. \"My mission is to hire the kinds of people from throughout the U.S. with different kinds of backgrounds, intellectual diversity, who can appeal and rebuild that trust. And I think that a lot of folks have a poor view of The Post because they don't feel that they've been well served by it,\" O'Neal told Fox News Digital in his first interview since landing the job. \"If there are people who had a perception that subscribing to The Post was like a form of activism and that they had to do it to oppose a particular politician or party now that we're opening up our lands and writing more widely in a nonpartisan way, I don't know, maybe you'll lose people that way,\" O'Neal continued. \"But I think the upside of where the growth is by appealing to many more Americans in rebuilding that trust, to me, that's a pretty clear decision.\" WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST FIRED OVER SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS AFTER CHARLIE KIRK'S ASSASSINATION The Washington Post lost a reported 250,000 subscribers when it elected not to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 for the White House. In his memo to staffers, O’Neal also reminded that \"management mandated all Washington Post employees based in the region return to the office five days a week\" and everyone is expected to comply. He also attached the company’s ethics guidelines and social media polices, urging staffers to cooperate. Karen Attiah, a former progressive Washington Post columnist, was terminated last month following social media posts related to the assassination of Charlie Kirk — a move that drew criticism from media freedom advocates.

Shutdown in Response to Breitbart's Matt Boyle at WH Press Briefing","text":"Vice President JD Vance debunked the left’s lies on the Democrat shutdown during a press briefing on Wednesday.\n\nBreitbart News’s Washington Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle asked the vice president to debunk two of the reigning lies currently touted by the left in the aftermath of the government shutdown.\n\n“You’re seeing a number of top Democrat leaders — from Kamala Harris and Chuck Schumer to Hakeem Jeffries — claim that it is a Republican shutdown caused by Trump,” Boyle said.\n\n“The second is that they’re out there now claiming that they don’t want to give health care to illegal aliens. Can you address both of those lies from the Democratic Party?” he asked.\n\nVance said it is “obvious” that this is a Democrat shutdown, urging Americans to look at the vote totals in the House and Senate as well as the actions of President Donald Trump.\n\n“Nearly every single House Republican voted to open the government, Matt. Nearly every single Senate Republican voted to open the government last night, and even to their credit, a few moderate Democrats voted to open the government. That’s not a Republican shutdown when nearly every single Senate Democrat votes to shut it down and every Republican voted to open it up,” Vance pointed out, calling it “obviously not true.”\n\n“Now you can disagree about a number of things, but you can’t disagree about the obvious fact that Republicans voted to open the government. The President stands ready to sign that opening of the government. We just need a few more Democrats to join us in that effort to open the government,” Vance continued before switching gears, responding to the question about Democrats now denying that they want to give free health care to illegal aliens.\n\n“The text is very clear. And I even saw — I think it was George Stephanopoulos in an interview with Mike Johnson — did a fact check that was totally rooted in baseless claims. It was basically Democrat propaganda. If you look at the legislative text that they gave us, they tried to turn on two separate provisions that would give healthcare benefits to illegal aliens,” Vance explained.\n\n“Number one, if you’re an American citizen, you’ve been to a hospital in the last few years, you probably noticed that wait times are especially large, and very often somebody who’s there in the emergency room waiting is an illegal alien, very often a person who can’t even speak English,” he said, asking why these individuals receive healthcare benefits at hospitals paid for by American citizens.\n\n“The answer is a decision made by the Biden administration that the Trump administration, working with congressional Republicans, undid. We turned off that money spigot to healthcare funding for illegal aliens. The Democrats, in their legislative texts want to turn it back on,” Vance said.\n\n“The second thing, Matt, is we all know that there are various ways in which the Biden administration waived away illegal immigration status… They gave asylum claims to people who weren’t really claiming asylum. And when they waved the magic wand of amnesty, giving millions of people legal status even though they were in the country illegally, they also gave those people access to healthcare benefits,” he said.\n\nUltimately, the vice president said Democrats are engaging in sleight of hand by saying, “‘No, no, those weren’t illegal aliens who were getting healthcare benefits,’ even though everybody knows they were in the country illegally.”\n\n“It’s a lie told by the Democrats that they’re not trying to give healthcare benefits to illegal aliens. It’s a lie that is obviously untrue if you just look at the text that they gave us, and all you have to do is understand that this is about who benefits,” he said, explaining that the Trump administration’s position is that the government should benefit American citizens — not illegal immigrants.\n\n“The Democrats are willing to shut it down to benefit illegal aliens.

Honestly, It's Relatable.","text":"107 Days, by Kamala Harris, Simon & Schuster, 304 pages, $30\n\n\"Tariffs are a tax on everyday Americans,\" writes Kamala Harris in 107 Days, the former vice president's new book on her experiences from the time then-President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential election through the night she lost to now-President Donald Trump. On the same page, she refers to Ross Ulbricht—the man who spent years in prison for running a website—as a \"fentanyl dealer.\"\n\nIt's a good example of the kind of whiplash you might get while reading this book.\n\nFrom the get-go, 107 Days offers ample reminders of what people find irritating about Harris. The scenes she conjures feel down-to-earth—making pancakes and doing puzzles with her nieces when she first gets the dropping-out news from Biden—but also somehow stage-managed. (Phony.) She makes a point of mentioning how she would not stand up from a table until Biden did and twice calls herself a \"stickler\" for rules and for punctuality. (Hall monitor.) She glosses over, rather than reckons with, parts of her prosecutorial career that haven't aged well, portraying herself as a pure defender of women, children, and the working man. (Hypocrite; Cop.)\n\nBut there are also reminders of what people like about Harris. She uses spicy language. She seems idealistic but also pragmatic. She is capable of a deadpan sort of humor. And she doesn't hold back when it comes to her rocky relationship with the Bidens or her dismay about the way Joe Biden handled both his presidential race and hers.\n\nA scene near the beginning features Harris watching Biden's infamously bad debate against Trump. After the event is over, one of her advisers hands her post-debate talking points that include the idea that Biden won. \"Are you kidding me?\" Harris writes.\n\nI don't think I would have continued beyond the first few pages if it weren't for this. Throughout the book, there is a hilarious undercurrent of disappointment in, disbelief at, and sometimes barely concealed rage about Biden, with whom she describes her relationship as \"complicated.\"\n\nFor instance, her husband, Doug Emhoff, complains that Biden gave her \"shit jobs\" for four years as vice president after Jill Biden allegedly pulled him aside on July 4, 2024, for a loyalty check. She describes the mantra of those around the Bidens during Joe's early days in the 2024 campaign: \"'It's Joe and Jill's decision.' We all said that, like a mantra, as if we'd all been hypnotized. Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness.\" She details a scene when Biden put on a MAGA hat during a September 11 event:\n\nAnd then I glanced across to the far side of the room, where Joe was sharing a joke with some guys in MAGA hats. One of them took his hat off and offered it to Joe.\nDon't take it.\nHe took it.\nDon't put it on. \nHe put it on.\nCameras clicked. Within hours, the picture was all over: Joe Biden in a MAGA hat, with the caption 'Biden endorses Trump over Harris.'\n\nI've been a vociferous critic of Harris in the past, and I'm sure I will continue to be one in the future. This book is a constant litany of policies she enacted or wanted to enact that range from bad to disastrous. And even if we put policy aside, I can never like Harris for the simple reason that she started a dishonest prosecution of Backpage that would later form the basis for a federal prosecution that ultimately ended in a good man taking his own life.\n\nBut reading this book, I did—for the first time—find Harris to be relatable (and, occasionally, amusing). She comes across more like a real person than she did in her first book, The Truths We Hold, or than she generally has when in the spotlight.\n\nReading 107 Days, I got the same suspicion that I did reading some old newspaper pieces about Harris or, ever so occasionally, in clips of her on the campaign trail: that there is a person here who can be bitingly funny, endearingly dorky, a little weird, and actually fun to be around. It's a person unlike the Harris whom we usually see, and it makes me wonder if part of Harris' whole problem has been a mismatch between her personality and the persona she's chosen to project.\n\nIn any event, much of Harris' new book is downright boring: a play-by-play of her campaign stops, lists of people she met, some surface-level notes about what they talked about or how she felt. It absolutely did not need to be 300 pages long. To keep with the conceit of an entry for every day of her campaign, we get a lot of fluff about what diner she stopped at or labor union she spoke to or church she visited, plus a whole lot of puffery about fighting for truth and justice and the American people.\n\nThere is also at least one glaring inaccuracy beyond the Ulbricht business: She claims that 350 transgender people, including 15 kids, were murdered in America in 2024. In fact, the Human Rights Campaign is aware of 32 \"transgender and gender-expansive people whose lives were…taken through violent means\" in the U.S. that year, only one of them a minor. Harris may be citing a report from Trans Europe and Central Asia, which pinpointed 350 murders around the world.\n\nOccasionally we get something more interesting—behind-the-scenes notes on some of the campaign's more memorable decisions, interviews, and dramas. There is the moment when Trump challenges the idea that she is black and she rejects her staff's decision to push back. (\"Are you fucking kidding me?\" she recalls herself saying. \"Today he wants me to prove my race. What next? He'll say I'm not a woman and I'll need to show my vagina?\")\n\nThere are her interviews with three potential V.P. picks, during which Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro seems to have ruined his chances by saying he would want to be in the room with her for every decision. (\"A vice president is not a copresident. I had a nagging concern that he would be unable to settle for a role as number two and that it would wear on our partnership,\" she writes.) There is her disappointment with herself for answering a question about what she would have done differently from Biden by saying there wasn't anything that came to mind. (\"Why. Didn't. I. Separate. Myself. From. Joe. Biden?\" she writes, noting that a member of her campaign team told her bluntly afterward that \"people hate Joe Biden\" and reflecting why it took her so long to grasp that she really needed to reinforce the differences between them.) She mentions how her debate prep partner dressed up as Trump and stayed in character during the breaks. How on the debate stage she was going to introduce herself to Trump—who had made a big deal of not knowing how to pronounce her name—by saying \"It's pronounced KA-mala,\" but decided at the last moment not to. (\"It felt bitchy,\" she says.) She also describes how close she came to calling Trump \"this motherfucker\" on stage.\n\nI know this apparent candor is calculated, but that doesn't mean there's nothing to learn here. All politician memoirs are political fictions, readable as a sort of meta-text: Why is this bit being included? What is this person trying to say about themselves? 107 Days seems desperate to convey that Harris is not Biden, was not responsible for Biden, and would have done things differently than Biden. In all of this, I believe her, though I also believe the differences would be a mixed bag of bad and good. Harris also seems eager to convey that she did all she could during the campaign and that, while she suffered from some bad personal and campaign choices, she was also constrained by the hand she was dealt, including the weirdness of running against someone like Trump. That seems fair enough.\n\nBut intended or not, there is another message that stands out, and it's that Harris is still really angry—about Biden and his people, about Trump and his lies, and about the hand we've all been dealt. Whether intended or not, I think that's perhaps the most relatable message of all.","summary":"The book offers ample reminders of what people find irritating about Harris.

Meaning, seeing how it works on camera,” he declared.\n\nAfter his co-host John A. Daly wondered if he was talking about disgraced ex-Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, Goldberg revealed that his scoop was actually about O’Reilly’s one-time colleague Kelly.\n\n“No, I would’ve guessed that too,” Goldberg, who was a regular guest on O’Reilly’s Fox primetime show, responded. “No, Megyn Kelly. Megyn Kelly was at CBS News the other day. You heard it here, you’re not going to hear it anyplace else.”\n\nAfter Goldberg’s remarks were picked up by Mediaite, however, Kelly – who has repeatedly insisted that she is no longer interested in returning to broadcast or cable news – took to social media to flat out deny the story.\n\n“Literally not one word of this is true,” Kelly tweeted on Tuesday. “Was not at cbs, did not have a screen test, am not going to cbs, and have ZERO desire to leave what I am doing now and join the sinking ship of broadcast news. @mediaite - might want to - um, ASK ME b/4 printing.”\n\nFollowing Kelly’s full-throated denial, Goldberg’s Substack page now includes the following editor’s note: “Megyn Kelly has responded that the meeting Bernie was told about, and comments on in this episode, between her and CBS News, did not occur.”\n\nAfter more than a decade with Fox News, Kelly left the conservative cable giant in early 2017 for NBC News, which had given her a massive contract to host a Sunday news magazine and daytime talk show. Her time with the Peacock network came to an end in 2019, though, when she was terminated following backlash over comments she made about blackface.\n\nSince leaving NBC, which saw the network pay her the remaining $30 million on her contract, Kelly has launched her own production company and the successful podcast The Megyn Kelly Show. Her podcast was picked up by SiriusXM in 2021, and the show’s YouTube channel has nearly 4 million subscribers.\n\nThe scuttled rumor over Kelly, who has become a Donald Trump loyalist after years of bad blood between the pair, potentially joining CBS News comes as the network appears to be cozying up to the president under Ellison’s ownership.\n\nPrior to Paramount's merger with Ellison’s Skydance Media in August, the former Paramount leaders agreed to pay Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris that CBS News’ lawyers said was “meritless.” The president has also claimed that Ellison agreed to a secret “side deal” that CBS would air $20 million of pro-Trump advertisements on CBS programming once Skydance took over the company.\n\nOn top of that, days before the merger was approved by the president’s handpicked FCC chief Brendan Carr, Paramount also announced that it was cancelling the top-rated CBS late-night show hosted by outspoken Trump critic Stephen Colbert. This was followed by Skydance assuring Carr that it would install an ombudsman to review “complaints of bias” at CBS News, as well as eliminate any diversity hiring policies.\n\nThose pre-merger moves, which sparked accusations of “bribery” by free press organizations, liberal critics and CBS employees, have prompted an investigation by Democratic lawmakers.\n\nMeanwhile, after saying “all the right things” when he took over as Paramount’s chief executive, CBS News staffers have apparently lost faith in Ellison and believe that he “just can’t be trusted” now.\n\nAmid the “imminent” purchase of The Free Press and the appointment of Kenneth Weinstein – a Trump acolyte and conservative think tank leader – as the network’s ombudsman, network staffers told The Independent that Ellison is a “liar” for claiming he didn’t want to “politicize” the network.\n\n“I mean, we all know that David Ellison is a liar and he just can't be trusted, and he can't be entrusted with the legacy of CBS News,” one staffer said.","summary":"‘Megyn Kelly was at CBS News the other day.

And this summer Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit over the editing of a CBS \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWeeks after that settlement, Paramount and Skydance won federal approval for their long-awaited merger.\n\nColbert later referred to Paramount's settlement as a \"big fat bribe\" during one of his show's opening monologues. Soon after, the company announced the future end date of the late-night show.\n\nDisney's suspension of Kimmel came on the heels of comments by the FCC's Carr that suggested affiliate ABC stations could lose their broadcast licenses if they aired content that was against the \"public interest.\" Trump made a similar threat regarding the broadcast networks that he said are \"against\" him.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

While mistakes are rare, they do happen as NPRC processes over 6,000 requests per day.\" Yet, Sherrill has maintained for nearly a week that the breach \"was no mistake.\" House Oversight Democrats confirmed the investigation on Tuesday, framing it as \"an investigation into the Trump Administration illegally meddling in the New Jersey governor's race.\" DEM GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE SLAMMED AS THE 'KAMALA HARRIS OF NEW JERSEY' AS ELECTION SLIDES INTO HOME STRETCH \"Jack needs to cooperate fully with investigators and reveal the full extent of his campaign’s participation in this illegal action,\" Sherrill charged in response to the National Archives launching a formal investigation. Ciattarelli campaign spokesperson Chris Russell responded to Sherrill on Tuesday, urging her to \"stop hiding and release her disciplinary records.\" NEW JERSEY GOP LAWMAKERS DEMAND SHERRILL RELEASE NAVAL ACADEMY RECORDS AS QUESTIONS SWIRL \"The Sherrill campaign's desperation is showing here,\" Russell told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"They are flat out lying about this internal NARA investigation that has nothing to do with our campaign in an attempt to distract attention away from the increasing likelihood that Congresswoman Sherrill is lying about what got her barred from graduation. Sherrill's refusal to release her disciplinary records can only be interpreted as her trying to hide the truth from NJ voters.\" \"The illegal disclosure of my military records to my political opponent is not just an attack against me; it is an attack on every veteran who served this country. New Jersey deserves better. It deserves leaders who protect our rights; not those who break the law to score political points,\" Sherrill countered, in one of several statements condemning the breach. The Ciattarelli campaign told Fox News Digital that Nicholas De Gregorio, a friend who is not directly involved in the campaign, \"submitted a lawful FOIA request\" about Sherrill's military background of his own accord. A spokesperson for the National Archives said leadership became aware of the breach on Sept. 22, after the technician mistakenly released the records while responding to a June 30 Freedom of Information Act request. National Archives said the technician who responded to De Gregorio's request about Sherrill's military record \"should NOT have released the entire record,\" which included private information like her Social Security number. The agency has apologized for the breach of privacy and has committed to holding their staff accountable for the blunder. And while Sherrill has blamed the breach on the Trump administration's political \"weaponization of the federal government,\" the NARA employee, a technician based in St. Louis, whom the National Archives spokesperson said released Sherrill's personal information by mistake, is not a political appointee. With less than five weeks until Election Day, the National Archives controversy has invigorated an already contentious race to replace Gov. Phil Murphy, who is term-limited this year, in the Garden State. A Fox News survey of New Jersey voters released Tuesday found Sherrill ahead of Ciattarelli by eight percentage points among likely voters (50-42%) and seven points among the larger sample of registered voters (48-41%), with both leads just outside the margin of sampling error. Democrats were quick to blame the National Archives breach on the Trump administration as the news broke last week. \"The Trump administration's breach of privacy is a slap in the face to our nation's brave servicemembers. It's shameful,\" former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial nominee, said Thursday. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has condemned the Trump administration for what they claimed was a \"decision\" to release the documents, despite a National Archives official confirming it was a low-level St. Louis branch employee responsible for \"failing to follow proper administrative procedures.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The Trump administration’s decision to release her unredacted military personnel files to her opponent's campaign, including her Social Security number, is yet another example of Donald Trump and the Republicans illegally weaponizing the federal government for political purposes,\" DNC Chair Ken Martin said, while calling the breach a \"shameful scandal that shows how little Donald Trump and Jack Ciattarelli think of the American military.\" Fox News' Dana Blanton contributed to this report.","summary":"A National Archives spokesperson said an employee mistakenly released Rep.

The 86-year-old died painfully. The biographers do not record what liquid was drained from Vidal’s body as he rotted away in the ruins of his final home – a Spanish revival mansion on Outpost Drive in the Hollywood Hills – only that he needed to be voided on a daily basis. What was in him? Chyme? Gastric acid? Black phlegm? I suspect it was bile.\n\nBy 2010, Vidal was waterlogged, a storied and slowly sinking destroyer. He could no longer control his bladder. He hallucinated. His brain, the doctors said, was “wet”. He had dementia and congestive heart failure and a tendency to excommunicate what few friends remained, or banish once-loved nephews he believed were spying on him for the Central Intelligence Agency. Old comrades turned away.\n\nChristopher Hitchens accused him in Vanity Fair of hawking “crank-revisionist and denialist history”. At the time, Hitchens was the spokesperson for a large constituency that believed liberal democracy could be spread throughout the Middle East by the US Marine Corps and the Fifth Fleet. Vidal thought that elements within the Bush administration might have allowed 9/11 to happen. He also predicted that the US would be run out of Afghanistan and would pave the way for China to resume its historic role as a world power.\n\nVidal seemed mad and sad and alone and drunk. His writing – his writing, Vidal’s, whose essays had been compared to his hero Montaigne’s – no longer seemed contemporary. It was the early Obama era. The cargo-cult optimism that accompanied the 44th president’s rise was not yet completely dispersed. And there was Vidal, who couldn’t read the room any more, gabbling from his wheelchair about the downfall of the United States, writing and saying everything was bad and would only get worse. Maybe he had nothing left to say, mistaking the decline of his own flesh and mind for the decline of the world itself. His watchful attendants – all of whom would be cut from Vidal’s legacy when he died in July 2012 – approached him wearing surgical gloves, as if to protect themselves from contagion. Vidal had always liked to quote Montaigne on death: “How did the living die and what did they say and how did they look at the end?” Those near Vidal as he lingered on and on noticed that however reduced he was, even when he was wracked and struggling to breathe, his eyes stayed wide open.\n\nGore Vidal was born 100 years ago. His family had roots in the Irish bog (maternal) and the Austrian Alps (paternal). While Vidal would eventually entertain on two coasts, and in London and Rome, his antecedents were heartlanders; his grandfather was a US senator from Oklahoma, a populist and an isolationist. His self-image was aristocratic: “I belong to the highest class there is: I’m a third-generation celebrity. My grandfather, father and I have all been on the cover of Time. That’s all there is. You can’t go any higher in America.”\n\nThe US in 1925 was largely dominated by a north-eastern Wasp establishment which took their manners, clothing, sporting habits, husbands and stylised anti-Semitism from the British aristocracy. The country was ambitious and industrious, driving hard and fast towards an imperial horizon. After the Second World War, Vidal would grow to become the chronicler of that transition from republic to empire. “We have embarked upon empire (Rome born again our heavy fate) without a Virgil in the crew, only tarnished silver writers in a bright uranium age,” he wrote in 1956: part lament, part audition for the role he was destined to play. An essayist, screenwriter, playwright, novelist and occasional ham actor, Vidal’s work adds up to a beguiling, barbed compound of Tacitus and Oscar Wilde.\n\nHe confused his contemporaries, the American alpha novelists like Norman Mailer, Saul Bellow and Philip Roth. His art was not as pure or secluded as Roth’s or Bellow’s, less frenzied than Mailer’s. “Art is energy shaped by intelligence,” he wrote. His intelligence was lacerating. His energy was bullying and gratuitous; he liked to goad his targets, to kick and scratch at them when they were down. An irrepressible bitch, he impugned people by questioning their mental acuity. He liked to tell his readers who people really were. Edward VII: “The Duke’s stupidity was of a perfection seldom encountered outside institutions.” F Scott Fitzgerald: “barely literate”. The English: “eccentric Norwegians”. Ronald Reagan: “an indolent cue-card reader”.\n\nHe produced trash from time to time in a way that even Mailer, author of an alimony-raising Marilyn Monroe biography, sidestepped. Caligula (1979) was “easily one of the worst films ever made”, Vidal said. He was its screenwriter. In Gore Vidal: A Biography (1999), Fred Kaplan reports how Bellow introduced his son to Vidal with the words, “I want him to meet someone really cynical!” They thought Vidal, when he turned to politics and power – the subject that is the true through-line of his work – was a paranoid bore. Roth, whose overblown late-historical novel sequence has rightly been compared to watching a man chewing, dismissed Vidal as “a society hairdresser who has written a book or two”. While Roth lived like a monk in his forested 150-acre Connecticut estate, Vidal palled around with Tim Robbins and Princess Margaret and Tennessee Williams. Following Goethe, Vidal did not believe talent could survive if it was solitary. Talent must enter the torrent of the world and fight. That was how real character formed. He laughed at the alphas for their “terrible garrulousness” and their lamely insular writing about writing. Men like Roth and Bellow were chestless talents, not mighty characters. Vidal noted that American authors were, “if not Waldenised solitaries, Darwinised predators constantly preying on one another”. He was a superb and steely predator.\n\nVidal predicted his own future and those of the other writers he came up with. Their lives – picked over by academics and journalists – would blot out their work. “Novels command neither interest nor affection but writers do, particularly colourful ones who have made powerful legends of themselves. I suspect that eventually novels will be read only to provide clues to the author’s personality…” In the obituaries, the awful prophetic power of Vidal’s novels and essays take a back seat to his mannerisms, sexual habits and friendships. There was naked envy at the way he was able to live. “I interviewed Vidal for the Sunday Times in 1984,” wrote one undoubtedly penurious British novelist in 2012 in a typical death notice. “We had lunch in his room at the Dorchester – A-list authors were well looked after then.” The obituarists were not remembering Gore Vidal. They were wondering why they weren’t as rich or as successful as he was. Otherwise they condemned him, as Gideon Rachman did in a short, curt piece in the Financial Times: “Vidal was an arrogant conspiracy theorist, trading off a reputation he made with novels written decades ago.”\n\nEarly on in his valedictory 1,200-page United States: Essays 1952-1992, Vidal tells his readers who he is. “I am at heart a propagandist, a tremendous hater, a tiresome nag,” he declared in 1956. Across reviews, reportage and memoir in that collection, Vidal prosecutes a set of unchanging arguments. America, once a republic, was now a decadent empire doomed to become a tyranny. Literature could not be taught by academics or studied in universities; it existed only to illuminate people and transform them into “archetypes – elemental figures like those wild gods our ancestors peopled heaven with”. Monotheism was “intrinsically funny”. The sexual attitudes of any given society were the result of political decisions. If an argument or personality inspired great hatred, that meant they were usually right about something. (This was convenient for Vidal, who attracted passionate hatred at all times.) History was a set of “crude fictions” agreed by contemporaries, then selected and presented as truth at a later date by unwitting historians and biographers. The world was governed by men’s deeds, not by buried Freudian motives. Events were the work of individuals who were “frivolous, even casual”. We are atoms. All the essential problems of life are the same, generation after generation. There is “no cosmic point to our lives”. Nothing follows us. “No thing. This is it. And quite enough, all in all.”\n\nLike Montaigne or Suetonius, Vidal had the gift of telling us what we ache to know. His birth and breeding gave him access to rooms that careful observers are often barred from. (The powerful and celebrated do not, generally, want to be watched too closely by cruel eyes.) From Vidal we learn that Amelia Earhart had “mild-white eyelashes”; Tennessee Williams once “commented favourably” on John F Kennedy’s arse; Orson Welles patted his stomach “as if it were a dog”; Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt’s arguments usually ended with her fleeing from the dinner table “in tears”; Anaïs Nin referred to herself as a “legend” in later life; Edmund Wilson, well into his seventies, would begin an evening at the Princeton Club by lining up a sequence of six martinis at its bar, and after a few drinks Clark Gable would “loosen his false teeth, which were on some sort of peg and then shake his head until they rattled like dice”. Vidal relates a public dinner with Harry Truman, with the former president in the middle of “making a particularly solemn point”. Suddenly Truman’s face “jerked abruptly into a euphoric grin, all teeth showing”. Vidal thought Truman had finally lost it, when he saw “photographers had appeared in the middle distance”. The high and the mighty, the commanders of fleets and bombers, the playwrights and artists: to Vidal they were all so many whores.\n\nIn late January this year I was in Washington for the second inauguration of Donald Trump. The Golden Horde was moving into the frozen city. There was flu in the air, and the bars began to fill with bearded young men in red hats with running nostrils who told me about the anonymous racist X accounts they ran from their phones. They were about to start working for the Pentagon or the State Department.\n\nAt a cocktail party I stood next to a famous Maga essayist dressed in white tie who had been pulled back into working for Trump on national security, while he went through the pros and cons of bombing Iran. On balance he thought it would happen soon. A gala reception was held for one of the released Israeli hostages. I couldn’t hear what she was saying because I was being harangued by somebody who believed 9/11 was an inside job. Trump was spoken of flatly, with no irony, as an emperor. The Golden Horde was not sure it wanted to go through the rigmarole of another election. The hottest party in town was called the “Coronation Ball”. We watched the ceremony in the Capitol rotunda on 20 January in a bar filled with boys hollering at the sight of the oligarchs who owned most of the American economy, men who once turned their newspapers and social platforms against Trump, kneeling and broken before his power. At night the white marble monuments in the centre of the city yellowed under artificial light until their colour was indistinguishable from old skull and bone.\n\nVidal did not live to see this moment but he would have recognised it. America was “rotting away at a funeral pace” he told the Times in 2009. “We’ll have a military dictatorship pretty soon, on the basis that nobody else can hold everything together.” He believed Obama would be broken by the “madhouse” that the US had become. The Americans were chased out of Kabul in 2021, years after it had become obvious that China had resumed its historic role as a major world power and a peer of the US. The cost of empire that pushed America down with “nukes, bases, debts” had eventually inspired a populist revolt from its immiserated citizenry, opening the gates of the capital to a figure Vidal knew well from history: Caesar.\n\nExtreme sickness had made an extreme remedy inevitable. The conspiracy theories Vidal obsessed over were now truths widely held and cherished throughout America. The madhouse rattled and jabbered to music that he heard first, many years before. When I returned from Washington, I found my old copy of United States. The author portrait showed him in black and white, turning shyly half away, his mouth turning towards a smile, eyes wide open. The years of bile lay far in the future. \n\nPurchasing a book may earn the NS a commission from Bookshop.org, who support independent bookshops\n\n[Further reading: Kamala Harris cares too much about being nice]","summary":"The writer understood better than anyone how far the United States was going to fall","url":"https://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2025/10/gore-vidal-american-prophet","image":"https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/10/01/202540GoreVidal.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 15:12:29","author":"Will Lloyd","authors":["Will Lloyd"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.568},{"id":365255146,"title":"The liberating power of vodou","text":"The Victorian poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning was the daughter of a Jamaica-born sugar baron. Everything that her father Edward Barrett owned came from his Caribbean cane plantations. The underside of the chattel slavery that brought him huge wealth was the mixed blood of the Barrett family line. Edward’s great fear was that sexual relations between his slaver antecedents and the enslaved Africans would show up in future generations. So he forbade all 11 of his children from marrying: the shame of what Victorian race scientists called “blood desertion” weighed on him.\n\nScholars have long debated whether Elizabeth thought she had African ancestry. During her honeymoon in Italy in 1846 – kept a secret from her controlling father – she completed the poem “The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim Point”, where a fugitive African woman decides to murder her child, whose father was white, to save her from a life of slavery. Her child was the result of rape by an overseer. “I am not mad: I am black”, cries her mother. The poem (published in a Boston anti-slavery journal) called for an end to plantation servitude across the Caribbean and Atlantic worlds. Even when slavery was abolished everywhere (last of all in Brazil, in 1888), the Barretts owned 31,000 acres of Jamaican land as well as an imposing townhouse in Marylebone, London. Until his death in 1857 Edward went to the City to arrange for cargoes of Jamaican sugar and rum to be transported to London on the two slaver ships still in his name. (Later, the Barrett great house in Jamaica was bought by the singer Johnny Cash.)\n\nThe glittering prosperity of ports such as Bristol and Liverpool was derived in large part from the “Africa trade”. In the trade’s heyday under King George III, West Indians (as Caribbean sugar impresarios were known) were often boorish, limited men: a popular melodrama from 1771, Richard Cumberland’s The West Indian, satirised planters as ostentatious layabouts. Behind their conspicuous luxury lay the “triangle merchants” who motivated the trade between Europe, Africa and the Caribbean. A triangle voyage carried trading goods from England to Africa, then captives from Africa to the Caribbean (the feared Middle Passage), and finally sugar, coffee, cotton and rum to England. It was the most nearly perfect commercial system in modern times, a loop of supply and demand that involved (in the words of the historian Robin Blackburn) a “predatory exploitation of labour”.\n\nIn January 1804 in Saint-Domingue in the French Caribbean, the enslaved people declared independence after they overthrew their French oppressors. The name Saint-Domingue was replaced by the aboriginal Taino Indian word Haiti (meaning “mountainous land”) and the Haitian flag created when the white band was ripped from the French tricolour. The uprising was led by Toussaint Louverture, a former plantation field hand. The Haitian constitution, declaimed in 1805 by Louverture’s successor Jean-Jacques Dessalines, outlawed slavery and stated that all Haitian citizens were “legally black”, even if they happened to be white. Conceivably, this was the first time in history that the term “black” had been used in an ideological sense. “We have dared to be free,” Dessalines said (before he was murdered by his own allies).\n\nHaiti’s anti-slavery insurgency is central to Daring to Be Free, Sudhir Hazareesingh’s absorbing and often revelatory history of black resistance to the transatlantic trade over the four centuries of its dismal existence. The Louverturean revolt was fired by the egalitarian ideals of the 1789-91 French Revolution: racial slavery was an intolerable injury to human nature. However, Hazareesingh argues that Haiti’s 13-year struggle for emancipation owed less to the salons of the Enlightenment than to African-influenced guerilla tactics and the conjure lore and spirit practice of New World religions such as Vodou (voodoo, in the old orthography). Most historians agree that the enslaved combatants of Saint-Domingue first rose up under a Jamaican Vodou priest or houngan named Dutty “Zamba” Boukman. One August night in 1791, Boukman called on the spirits of ancestral Africa to avenge the French plantocracy. Louverture was reportedly present at the animist ceremony, and within six weeks his rebel armies had burned down enemy plantations. Dessalines, himself a houngan, worshipped the warrior spirit of Ogou Ferraille from the Bight of Benin.\n\nHazareesingh is a Mauritius-born historian and author of Black Spartacus, a superb life of Louverture. In this new book he maintains that Enlightenment ideals alone did not abolish slavery, and shifts the focus away from Christian abolitionists who often derided African culture to the agency of Afro-Atlantic insurgents and conspirators. Runaway resistance, known in the New World as marronage, had its roots in the slave-driving Islamic caliphates and kingdoms of Africa. The African side of the triangle trade – sometimes called the “black” trade because it was controlled by non-Europeans – was exemplified by the slave castles the British operated along the Gold Coast which served as holding centres for Africans sold into servitude by fellow Africans. Men and women who escaped the slave-raiding parties of West Africa and the Arab Peninsula were able to pass on some knowledge of marronage to Africans ferried across the Atlantic. In Jamaica today the Maroons (from the Spanish cimarrón, “wild”) are exalted as the world’s first black freedom fighters. The Jamaican apostle of black liberation Marcus Garvey claimed Maroon ancestry for himself.\n\nHazareesingh barely touches on the uncomfortable truth that the Maroons fought for their own liberty only, not the overall liberty of captive fellow Africans. Infamously, Maroons sided with the British in putting down the 1865 Morant Bay uprising in post-emancipation Jamaica, when half-starving “freed” bonded men and women rose up to protest against their lack of paid work. The governor of Jamaica, Edward Eyre, fearing the Haiti-like spectre of black rule, suppressed the “rebellion” with the utmost severity, executing up to 439 of the participants, and publicly flogging at least 600 others. The Maroons of Jamaica are thus left with the ambivalent legacy as both heroes of, and traitors to, black freedom.\n\nIn his scholarly survey of African emancipatory influences in Cuba, Haiti, Mauritius, Jamaica, Brazil and the United States, Hazareesingh emphasises the role played by women as disruptors and warrior figures in the cause of freedom. In sugar-rich Dominica in the 18th century, female Maroon chiefs conducted guerilla sorties on the British from their jungle hideouts. In eastern Jamaica the Maroons were led by a Gold Coast tribeswoman known as Queen Nanny, who reputedly fended off the Redcoats by catching their bullets in the cleft of her buttocks. (It is more likely that she lifted her skirts to moon at the troops – a gesture of extreme contempt in Jamaica.) Nanny is now a National Hero of Jamaica whose likeness appears on the J$500 banknote. As an adept of Afro-Caribbean Obeah sorcery she went into battle against the British after summoning the ghosts of her Ashanti warrior ancestors in today’s Ghana. Maroon communities still exist in Jamaica; they have preserved a unique subculture of African languages, music and spirit animism.\n\nHaiti, the world’s first black republic, provided the basis for the Pan-African and post-colonial independence movements of the 20th century. The prospect of a black state founded on the expulsion of its white community horrified the West, but to African-American abolitionists such as Nat Turner and Frederick Douglass (known as “black Toussaints”), Louverture was the morning star of a new era for the Atlantic world. For Garvey, Louverture was “the greatest Negro” and symbol of what black people could achieve through collective strength. Garvey’s messianic notion of blackness and African redemption was nevertheless problematic at times for his fellow black activists. In 1934 he proclaimed Adolf Hitler a “wonderful personality” who demanded “respect” for his insistence on racial purity for the German volk. He thought mixed marriages to be a social misfortune. He rejected the liberal ideal of integration and, bizarrely, praised the Ku Klux Klan for wishing to “preserve their race from suicide through miscegenation”. White extremists have tried to show Garvey up as a crypto-racist; in 1960s and 1970s Britain, not uncommonly, conservative-minded politicians depicted Garveyite Back-to-Africa movements as an equivalent, anti-white racism – “Enoch Powellism in reverse”. Daring to Be Free, a marvel of historical analysis and research, is the beginning of wisdom in these matters. \n\nDaring to Be FreeSudhir HazareesinghAllen Lane, 464pp, £30\n\nPurchasing a book may earn the NS a commission from Bookshop.org, who support independent bookshops\n\n[Further reading: Kamala Harris cares too much about being nice]","summary":"Slave risings across the Caribbean, argues Sudhir Hazareesingh’s new book, drew less on Enlightenment ideas than African spirit lore","url":"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/book-of-the-day/2025/10/the-liberating-power-of-vodou","image":"https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/10/01/202540Slavery.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 15:07:59","author":"Ian Thomson","authors":["Ian Thomson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.149},{"id":365223110,"title":"JD Vance Says Dems Have Taken the Economy Hostage With Government Shutdown: ‘There’s Going to Be Some Pain’ | Video","text":"After the federal government shut down for the first time in nearly seven years overnight, Vice President JD Vance stopped by “CBS Mornings” early on Wednesday for an interview with co-host Tony Dokoupil.\n\n“Why are we in this position? We’re in this position because Senate Democrats decided that they were going to shut down the government, despite the fact that the House voted to keep the government open,” Vance began. “To be honest, Tony, it’s actually not all Senate Democrats — to their great credit, a number of moderate Democrats voted with Republicans to keep the government open last night. Unfortunately, it was one faction of one branch of government, the far left faction of the Senate Democrats, who decided to shut down the People’s Government.”\n\n“There are critical essential services that the people rely on that are going to suffer because of this. There are people who benefit from low income food programs, families like mine, who benefited from those programs, who are going to see those programs disappear,” he continued from his VP mansion. “There are critical services that the Democrats have taken hostage because they have a policy disagreement that they are open to work with us on, but they shouldn’t be shutting the government down because of that policy disagreement.”\n\nAccording to CBS News’ estimates, “up to 750,000 workers could be furloughed every day, costing them $400 million in pay per day,” with one economist telling the network that could cost the U.S. economy $7 billion per week. While essential workers like air traffic controllers and military personnel will still have jobs to do, they won’t immediately get paid as Congress remains deadlocked over its funding deal.\n\n“We don’t want to lay anybody off, but what we do want to do is make sure that as much of the essential services of government remain functional as possible. We were sort of dealt this hand by that faction of Senate Democrats who shut down the government. We’re going to have to deal with it. We’re going to have to make sure that as much of the People’s Government remains open or functional as possible. That’s what we’re going to do,” Vance insisted. “But there’s going to be some pain, and there’s necessarily going to be some pain because Senate Democrats refuse to re-open the government. We hope that they’ll change their minds in the days to come.”\n\nWhile Dokoupil attempted to push back against Vance’s claims of Affordable Care Act subsidies expiring in 2026 (as opposed to the Nov. 1 renewal notices) and its eligibility towards “illegal aliens,” the politician instead dodged those questions by labeling them as “crosstalk.”\n\n“In the past, of course, people have shut down the government, but what we’ve learned through many cycles of government shutdowns is they never work. They cause a lot of damage,” Vance said. “We should take that wisdom, open up the government and then talk about how to ensure that people have access to health care. We want that, Tony. We want people to have access to health care, we just don’t want to shut down the government as part of a hostage-taking tactic, which is what we’ve done because of the Senate Democrats in the situation they put us in.”\n\n“We’ve been working with insurance companies to ensure that we have the time necessary to get the right reforms in place so that people’s health care premiums don’t skyrocket. Of course, we inherited this really bad health care system from the last days of the Biden administration. We want to fix it. We just don’t want to shut down the government while we’re fixing it. Why can’t we open up the government fix the health care problem and actually work together for a change?” he concluded. “You don’t take the economy hostage because you want a particular health care policy, especially when The White House is offering to work with Senate Democrats to fix that policy. So let’s fix it. Let’s re-open the government. Let’s do something for the American people and not take the economy hostage by shutting down the government. We’re already in this — each day that we keep going it’s just going to get worse, so let’s stop it.”\n\nVance’s CBS appearance also notably comes three months after parent company Paramount reached a $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump after he sued CBS News for $20 billion over editing a “60 Minutes” with former VP Kamala Harris.","summary":"\"We want them to have access to health care as much as anybody,\" the vice president tells \"CBS Mornings\" host Tony Dokoupil from his VP mansion\n\n\nThe post JD Vance Says Dems Have Taken the Economy Hostage With Government Shutdown: &#8216;There&#8217;s Going to Be Some Pain&#8217; | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/jd-vance-government-shutdown-cbs-mornings/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jd-vance-cbs.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 14:30:38","author":"JD Knapp","authors":["JD Knapp"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.603},{"id":365237576,"title":"Kamala Harris office silent when questioned if fact-checker reviewed new book before publication","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris' memoir recapping her experiences on the 2024 campaign trail includes a handful of inaccuracies that opened the doors to questions about whether the former Democrat Party leader hired a fact-checker to review her personal retelling of the unprecedented election year.

HARRIS WAS STUNNED OVER BIDEN'S BOTCHED DEBATE RESPONSE ABOUT FALLEN SERVICE MEMBERS IN AFGHANISTAN ‘13 marines’ were killed in botched withdrawal Harris inaccurately claimed only U.S. Marines were killed during the Biden–Harris administration's botched and chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, omitting mention that one soldier and one Navy corpsman were among the 13 U.S. service members killed in a suicide bombing at the Kabul Airport's Abbey Gate. Harris' inaccuracies were included in a section of her book focused on then-President Biden failing to accurately debate President Donald Trump on his military leadership during his failed 2024 debate against Trump. \"He’s got so much material on this—Trump calling our fallen soldiers 'suckers and losers,'\" Harris wrote of what ran through her head when Biden was asked about his role as commander in chief. \"He managed to get off that line but had stepped on it earlier by saying no one had died in wars overseas on his watch, seeming to forget the thirteen marines who died in the bomb blast at the airport during the evacuation of Afghanistan. I’d been on Air Force Two when it happened, and we had to change our flight plan to get back to DC in the face of that tragedy. How could he overlook that day?\" she wrote, expressing her surprise over the response, but misidentifying those who were all killed as members of the Marines Corps. The Biden administration repeatedly came under fire for its handling of the Afghan withdrawal. The botched withdrawal, which included leaving military equipment worth millions of dollars in the hands of the Taliban, was viewed as preamble for adversaries such as Russia to invade Ukraine, as the U.S. looked weak on the international stage, critics raged at the time. The Taliban regained control of Afghanistan upon the U.S.' withdrawal. HARRIS LITERALLY THREW 'JOE BIDEN WON' TALKING POINTS ON TABLE AFTER DISASTROUS DEBATE: 'ARE YOU KIDDING ME?' Identifies ‘Silk Road’ founder as ‘fentanyl dealer’ In Harris' afterword of the book, she took issue with the individuals Trump granted clemency upon his return to the Oval Office, including those involved with the breach of the U.S. Capitol of Jan. 6, 2021, \"numerous tax cheats\" and Ross Ulbricht, who Harris identified simply as a \"fentanyl dealer.\" \"The Justice Department is going after Trump’s enemies list, while Trump supporters have been pardoned and released: January 6 rioters who attacked police, the fentanyl dealer Ross Ulbricht, numerous tax cheats,\" Harris wrote. Ulbricht, however, was never charged or convicted of fentanyl-specific crimes. Ulbricht was the founder of the now-defunct darknet drug market previously called Silk Road, which is viewed as the first modern version of the dark web. He was arrested in 2013 at the age of 29 and found guilty in 2015 of distributing narcotics (via conspiracy), distributing narcotics by means of the internet, conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit computer hacking and continuing criminal enterprise. Fentanyl is a wildly powerful synthetic opioid that has gripped the nation and caused an increase in overdose deaths. Fentanyl overdose deaths did not dramatically rise until 2013, when Ulbricht was arrested, and followed previous national addiction trends to prescription opioids and heroin between the late 1990s and 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. Ulbricht, who identifies as a political libertarian, was sentenced to life without parole, with his friends and family advocating for his release during the more than 11 years he spent behind bars. Trump answered the call to pardon him Jan. 21. \"I just called the mother of Ross William (Ulbricht) to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,\" Trump wrote in a social media post after his inauguration. \"The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me. He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years. Ridiculous!\" Following Harris' book release, the now-free Ulbricht took her claim of identifying him as a \"fentanyl dealer\" head-on in an X post slamming the characterization. \"Hey@KamalaHarris, You called me 'the fentanyl dealer' in your new book and attacked President Trump for freeing me after more than *ELEVEN* years in prison. Yet, I wasn't prosecuted for dealing drugs myself and fentanyl wasn't part of my charges. The truth has never mattered to you. The goal is just to make me and President Trump look bad at all cost, isn't it? Don't be a sore loser, Kamala,\" he wrote. KAMALA HARRIS PLAYS UP COZY RELATIONSHIP WITH HILLARY CLINTON AS WEDGE WITH BIDEN WIDENS ‘Closest election’ in the 21st century Harris launched her book tour in September, when she began joining media interviews and stops in cities across the country to celebrate her 107-day campaign, and also repeatedly has claimed it was the \"closest election\" this century. \"It was the closest election in the 21st century. It was one of the top three closest elections in the last century. So for all those pundits who want to say that America is not ready for a woman to be president, I reject that,\" Harris said during her New York City book stop on Sept. 24. She again claimed just days later from Howard University: \"By the way, what is also historic about that, in many ways — it was the closest election for president of the United States in the 21st Century.\" \"Period. Period,\" she added. Harris lost both the Electoral College and popular vote to Trump during the 2024 election in a defeat that also included each of the seven battleground states voting in favor of Trump. Harris ended the campaign with 75,019,617 total votes to Trump's 77,304,184 votes, and 226 electoral votes to Trump's 312. The 2000 election between George W. Bush and then-Vice President Al Gore is considered the closest election of this century, was ultimately decided by 537 votes in Florida. Bush also notably lost the popular vote in that election, but secured the needed electoral votes to cinch victory, while Trump also lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College in the 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

I think that my upbringing informs my choices. When I choose to paint the landscape, I take objects and materials that are from areas that are discounted.\n\nWhen I produce work, a lot of that messaging tends to put me in a light that people will label me an activist, but I'm more just kind of paying attention.\n\nJeffrey Brown: These days, Martinez's work is exhibited in major museums, including the Whitney in New York and the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art.\n\nBut when President Trump ordered ICE raids in his community and the National Guard to Los Angeles, Martinez responded, photographing his neon works, printing them on corrugated plastic and handing them out at protests.\n\nPatrick Martinez: It's self-preservation to be making this work, right? But it also shows you what I thought about what was happening in these times. And me sharing it helps people cope with everything that they're kind of going through right now. And if they don't have the words to kind of come up with, they can use my work as a placeholder.\n\nJeffrey Brown: But while some individual artists are addressing the moment, the larger art and museum worlds have mostly avoided directly confronting the Trump administration.\n\nRobin Pogrebin is a culture reporter for The New York Times.\n\nRobin Pogrebin, The New York Times:\n\nYou see a kind of — much more of a cowed, capitulating stance on the part of the art world, I think a sense of resignation. It may be just something they have to hunker down and weather for the next four years under Trump. You have seen a few isolated examples.\n\nAmy Sherald is a prominent artist who upon hearing that one of her paintings was possibly going to be pulled by the Smithsonian board from a upcoming show at the National Portrait Gallery, decided to cancel the entire exhibition. That was a very bold move. It's an example of an artist who can kind of afford to take that risk. She is a very solid success.\n\nJeffrey Brown: The Smithsonian, for the record, says it was adding a video to accompany a painting, not taking the painting out of the exhibit.\n\nBruce Springsteen, Musician: The American that I love, the American that I have sung to you now…\n\nJeffrey Brown: Among prominent musicians who've spoken or sung their protest, Bruce Springsteen…\n\nBruce Springsteen: … is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration.\n\nJeffrey Brown: … whose roar of words with Donald Trump dates back to his first term and was reignited this year by the rock star while on tour in Europe.\n\nThe back-and-forth got so heated, the president threatened to investigate Springsteen and Beyonce for appearances they made on the 2024 campaign trail for his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd Sheryl Crow, whose song \"The New Normal,\" she said, is a response to a political moment she describes as so unbelievably bizarre.\n\nSinger-songwriter Ani DiFranco, long known for her activism, is still at it with new urgency, she says. But she also wonders why the music world has been mostly quiet.\n\nAni DiFranco, Musician: Why aren't there more? Why isn't protest music the top of the pops like it was in other eras of American political turmoil and change and evolution.\n\nI think one thing that we are all suffering from is fatigue, crisis fatigue and doom fatigue.\n\nManuel Oliver, Activist: Tell me now what happened.\n\nJeffrey Brown: Manuel Oliver was thrust into the worlds of art and theater after the killing of his 17-year-old son, Joaquin, in the mass shooting in Parkland Florida on Valentine's Day 2018.\n\nManuel Oliver: In order to scream out the urgency of fixing what happened to Joaquin, I found art as an excellent way of sending that message. And that could be painting sculptures and in this case theater.\n\nWhat happened on Joaquin's side?\n\nJeffrey Brown: In 2019, Oliver produced the first version of his one-man play, \"Guac.\" In it, he tells the story of Joaquin's vibrant, but short life, his horrific murder, and Oliver's fight to honor his son through advocacy for gun reform.\n\nManuel Oliver: He is the one that is motivating us and, I will prove it to you.\n\nJeffrey Brown: The play is always evolving, and so when ICE deportations of undocumented migrants escalated, Oliver felt the need to respond. One such addition, a tweet by his son written shortly before he was killed that Oliver believes is especially relevant today.\n\nIn the post, Joaquin calls out President Trump's first-term policy of separating undocumented migrant families.\n\nManuel Oliver: We thought that it was very important that if we're talking about Joaquin, we should add Joaquin's own words, and so people will understand this as an issue that Joaquin would be really mad about.\n\nJeffrey Brown: Another change reflects the moment for Manuel Oliver himself as a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Venezuela.\n\nManuel Oliver: I'm one of those guys that has been targeted as criminals and bad hombres. So, on the play, I had a line.\n\nI won't be deported for doing this (expletive deleted).\n\nI correct myself now, which I didn't before. Like, wait a minute, I am an American citizen, but I still can be deported. And that's a new reality.\n\nSam Jay, Comedian: He didn't even get in office yet, he was like, yes, we taking Canada.\n\nSam Jay: And I was like, I kind of agree with that.\n\nJeffrey Brown: Sam Jay, a former writer for \"Saturday Night Live\" with her own HBO and Netflix specials, has long used comedy to make sense of current events.\n\nSam Jay: I think mainly my place is to be honest, to tell my truth from my perspective. I tend not to lean right or left in anything that I say or do. And I kind of like to live in the gray.\n\nJeffrey Brown: Jay's new stand-up show is titled \"We the People,\" tackling subjects such as race and social media in America to try to figure out why the country is so divided.\n\nSam Jay: I felt like the conversation was kind of stuck as far as where we are as Americans, where we're going as this democracy.\n\nJeffrey Brown: And how does comedy do that in ways that other art forms don't?\n\nSam Jay: I think because comedy is kind of main-veining art in a little bit of a way. It's like a direct conversation.\n\nJimmy Kimmel, Host, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\": We hit some new lows over the weekend.\n\nJeffrey Brown: Late-night comedy, of course, has become the stuff of 24-hour news, with the short-lived suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show and the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's.\n\nDo you think that will impact other comedians?\n\nSam Jay: I mean, I don't think there's a way it won't. Does it lean towards people getting more active and going like, hey, something scary is going on, or do people duck and hide?\n\nJeffrey Brown: What about for you?\n\nSam Jay: I'm going to just keep doing my shows and saying what I believe in and getting on stage for as long as I'm allowed to do that.\n\nJeffrey Brown: One prominent player in all this still…\n\nActor: A dictator from the Middle East. Oh, relax, guy.\n\nJeffrey Brown: … \"South Park,\" which has garnered attention and eyeballs with its skewering of President Trump since it began its 27th season this summer. What's next for the arts world as a whole? The New York Times’ Robin Pogrebin:\n\nRobin Pogrebin: This is a new day we're living in, where even those who would seem to be empowered and independent of Trump just don't want to poke that bear. What I'm wondering is whether or not this will have some really lasting effects that will have to be built back from, whether they will feel more cautious going forward.\n\nSam Jay: It's stressful, bro.\n\nJeffrey Brown: For the \"PBS News Hour,\" I'm Jeffrey Brown.\n\nSam Jay: This is on us, and when I say us, I mean…\n\nAmna Nawaz: Another terrific report from Jeff Brown there.","summary":"The artsy self-regard was off the charts on Monday’s PBS News Hour, whose producers surely felt blessed that they were able to work into their “Arts in Action” segment, Bruce Springsteen’s surprise appearance at a New York film festival the night before, in which he called the Trump administration “treasonous.”\n\n\nCo-anchor Amna Nawaz: At a surprise New York film festival performance last night, rock legend Bruce Springsteen publicly expressed concern for the political climate in the country, saying — quote — \"We're living through particularly dangerous times.\" But as the Trump administration increasingly targets free speech and the arts, musicians and artists of all kinds are facing a difficult decision, whether to speak out or keep their heads down.

That was their second attempt of the night, after voting on a bill supported by Democrats. Hours later, the shutdown began.\n\nAs the government closed, rhetoric became heightened from both sides of the aisle, with each party and their allies pointing the blame at their counterparts -- each claiming the opposing party \"owns\" the shutdown.\n\n\"Democrats have officially voted to CLOSE the government,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, said on social media, following the Senate vote.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said the shutdown amounted to \"the clearest sign yet that Republicans are inept, incompetent, and lack any respect for the American people.\"\n\nDemocrats mostly hung together to deny the votes necessary to keep the government funded as they continue to say that any funding solution must include health care related provisions. Several Democrats crossed party lines and voted in favor of the clean-funding bill. \n\nSen. Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, said after the vote and prior to the shutdown that Democrats wanted to \"sit down and negotiate, but the Republicans can't do it in their partisan way, where they just say it's our way or the highway.\"\n\n\"It's the Republicans who will be driving us straight towards a shutdown tonight, and at midnight, the American people will blame them for bringing the Federal Government to a halt,\" he added.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris in social media post said, \"Republicans are in charge of the White House, House, and Senate. This is their shutdown.\"\n\nRepublican National Committee Chair Joe Gruters meanwhile pointed the blame at Democrats, saying they were \"solely responsible\" for the shutdown.\n\n\"Democrats are holding up critical funding for our veterans, seniors, law enforcement, and working families because they want to pass a far-left wish list costing more than $1 trillion,\" he said in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for the committee, Sonali Patel, echoed Gruters, saying the Domcrats in the Senate \"caved to the far-left, played partisan politics, and forced this shutdown.\"\n\n\"They own it,\" Patel said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune said at a press conference after Tuesday's failed votes that Republicans are now in the hunt for a few additional Democrats to support their clean, short term funding bill after three Democrats defected during tonight's vote.\n\nSens. John Fetterman, Catherine Cortez Masto and Angus King -- an independent who caucuses with Democrats -- had bucked their party leader and voted with Republicans on a short-term funding bill aimed at keeping the government open for 7 more weeks.\n\nThune said he intends to bring that bill forward for a vote again tomorrow. And he believes more Democrats might be willing to support it.\n\n\"There are others out there, I think who don't want to shut down the govt but who are being put in a position by their leadership that should make them, ought to make all of them very uncomfortable,\" Thune said. \n\nHe added, \"So we'll see. I think that tonight was evidence that there was some movement there and will allow our democrat colleagues to have additional opportunities to vote on whether or not to keep the government open, or in the case of tomorrow now probably to open it back up.\"\n\nABC News' Justin Gomez and Lauren Peller contributed to this report.","summary":"The closure came amid an impasse between congressional Democrats and Republicans, who are being led by President Donald Trump.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/reactions-us-government-shutdown/story?id=126106926","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/952e26fd-03d4-4b38-abf3-9031b5ddcd38/gov-main_1759309370222_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 12:12:07","author":"Allison Pecorin,Kevin Shalvey,Oren Oppenheim","authors":["Allison Pecorin","Kevin Shalvey","Oren Oppenheim"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.303},{"id":365153216,"title":"Federal shutdown begins as Trump warns Democrats of 'irreversible' consequences and more top headlines","text":"Good morning and welcome to Fox News' morning newsletter, Fox News First.

Mikie Sherrill is facing criticisms that she is the \"Kamala Harris of New Jersey\" as the Garden State enters its final leg of an election cycle that will either flip it red or elect a likely next star for the Democratic Party. Sherrill is in the midst of a tight race against her Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, whose campaign has slammed Sherrill as similar to former Vice President Kamala Harris for occasional gaffes, claims she shies away from public events and for allegedly running a \"choreographed\" campaign. \"There’s similarities (between Sherrill and Harris) in that they both are incapable of answering basic questions and seem to have a penchant for putting their foot in their mouth,\" Chris Russell, a New Jersey GOP consultant who works with the Ciattarelli campaign, told the New York Post earlier in September. They \"hide from the press, hide from the public (and are) very, very managed and choreographed.\" The Democratic Party is currently seeking out its next big-name stars after Harris failed to rally enough support at the 2024 ballot box to defeat President Donald Trump, leaving the party in a tailspin as it looks for fresh leadership going into the midterms. New Jersey and Virginia are the only states holding gubernatorial elections in 2025, providing Sherrill and Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the platform to potentially become new Democratic powerhouses if they prove victorious come election day. DEM GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE HIT WITH ACCUSATIONS OF NEPOTISM OVER CHILDREN'S ACCEPTANCE INTO NAVAL ACADEMY Fox News Digital took a look at Sherrill's professional and political background and found a handful of similarities with the former vice president as she looks to keep the Garden State blue. Sherrill first was elected to the U.S. House in 2018, flipping the 11th District seat away from the Republicans as part of that election year's blue wave. Similar to Harris notching firsts as a woman in high-profile roles — most notably becoming the first female vice president in 2020 — Sherrill's 2018 election cemented her as the first female to represent the 11th District. Sherrill, who is a military veteran, also worked as a prosecutor in the days leading up to jumping into politics. She earned her law degree from Georgetown University before working at a New York City law firm and joining the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Jersey as a federal prosecutor in 2015, according to her biography. Harris also served as a prosector ahead of running for elected office, launching her career in the Alameda County, California, District Attorney’s Office as a deputy district attorney in 1990. In the late 1990s, she moved over to the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office as assistant district attorney, then to the San Francisco city attorney’s office, before running in 2004 to become San Francisco’s top cop. TOP GUBERNATORIAL RACE ROCKED BY ALLEGATIONS OF LEAKS AND DIRTY TRICKS AMID IMPROPER MILITARY RECORDS RELEASE Unlike Harris, Sherrill is a U.S. Navy veteran and former Sea King helicopter pilot who spent more than nine years on active duty in the United States Navy. She left the Navy in 2003 at the rank of lieutenant and went into law school, according to her congressional biography. Sherrill has come under fire from her Republican challenger's campaign for reportedly ducking public events and media interviews in favor of running an alleged \"choreographed\" campaign. A review of Sherrill's campaign website's \"events\" section Tuesday did not yield upcoming campaign events and speeches from Sherrill, but instead focused on volunteering events, such as door knocking and working phone banks. Sherrill did join MSNBC Monday evening, took part in a meet and greet with Jewish voters Sunday, celebrated the Hindu holiday of Navratri in Jersey City that same day, as well as addressed South Jersey voters and union members at various events earlier in September, according to a review of her campaign's Facebook page. Harris was accused of avoiding the media in her first weeks as the Democratic presidential nominee in 2024. She worked to rally support for 39 days without a media interview before joining a CNN sit-down interview Aug. 29, 2024, while accompanied by then-running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. A review of Ciattarelli's campaign website shows he has nine upcoming events listed across the state, including rallies, meet and greets and \"business stops\" at local shops. Sherrill and Ciattarelli both took part in the election cycle's first gubernatorial debate earlier in September at Rider University, where the two sparred over the state's notoriously high taxes, abortion and immigration. The pair is set to return to the debate stage Oct. 8. Similar to Harris, Sherrill also has a strong campaign platform vowing to protect abortion access, including noting on her campaign website that she supports \"enshrining the right to an abortion in New Jersey's state constitution to permanently protect reproductive freedom.\" Harris was the first known sitting vice president to visit an abortion provider back in 2024, and repeatedly championed abortion access while on the campaign trail. The New Jersey Democrat also has faced campaign attacks for \"gaffes,\" including in May when she tripped over her words when asked in an interview what top piece of legislation she would like to pass. REPUBLICAN AIMING TO FLIP BLUE STATE RIPS DEM RIVAL FOR BLAMING 'EVERYTHING ON TRUMP’ \"That’s a really good question, ’cause there’s so many that are coming to mind right now,\" she responded, before adding that she would like to see a federal block grant program to fund \"key programs\" in New Jersey, including in the \"healthcare area.\" Ciattarelli's campaign has since used the segment of the interview in ads to slam Sherrill as having \"no plans\" to lead the state. \"She’s a gaffe machine, frankly,\" Russell added in a comment to the New York Post earlier in September. Harris frequently came under scrutiny for \"word salads\" during public events, which included using repetitive or confusing phrases such as \"unburdened by what has been\" and \"children of the community are children of the community.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Sherrill's campaign Tuesday afternoon for comment but did not immediately receive a reply. \"Mikie has gotten support from fellow veterans to seniors to families struggling to make ends meet to young people hoping to build their future in New Jersey,\" Sherrill campaign spokesperson Sam Chan told the New York Post. \"Jack’s campaign is desperate because Mikie is fighting for every New Jersey family and Jack is only out for himself and follows Trump’s lead without a shred of independence,\" Chan added of Ciattarelli, who is in the midst of his third run for New Jersey governor. The gubernatorial race is heating up in its final month as Ciattarelli works to close a polling gap in the historically blue state. Current Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy is term limited and unable to run for re-election. Chris Christie served as New Jersey's last GOP governor, serving from 2010 to 2018. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sherrill is in the midst of facing a campaign scandal after a report in September revealed that the United States Naval Academy blocked Sherrill from taking part in her graduation amid the cheating scandal. The three New Jersey Republicans in the U.S. House are demanding Sherrill release her military records connected to the major cheating scandal at the Naval Academy in 1994. Democrats have since called for an investigation into the release of Sherrill's files after it was revealed the National Personnel Records Center released Sherrill's improperly redacted military personnel files, which included private information such as her social security number, to a Ciattarelli ally. Sherrill has slammed the release of the report and said she was banned from walking at her graduation because she declined to report classmates who were involved in the scandal.","summary":"Republican Jack Ciattarelli&apos;s campaign compares Democratic opponent Rep.

And they're Democrats, they're going to be Democrats,\" Trump told reporters, adding a \"lot of good can come down from shutdowns.\"Multiple US embassies announced on X that their accounts would only be updated with \"urgent safety and security information\", while NASA said it was \"CLOSED due to a lapse in Government funding.\"Government operations began grinding to a halt at 12:01 am (0401 GMT) Wednesday, after a frenetic but ultimately failed bid in the Senate to rubber-stamp a short-term funding resolution already approved by the House of Representatives.Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement that \"Trump and Republicans have now shut down the federal government because they do not want to protect the health care of the American people.\"\"Democrats remain ready to find a bipartisan path forward to reopen the government\", but will need a \"credible partner,\" said the statement published just after the deadline passed.The shutdown will not affect vital functions like the Postal Service, the military and welfare programs like Social Security and food stamps.But up to 750,000 workers could be sent home each day and would not be paid until the shutdown was over, according to the Congressional Budget Office.This is the first shutdown since the longest one in US history -- lasting 35 days -- that began almost seven years ago during Trump's previous term.Hopes of a compromise had been hanging by a thread since Monday, when a last-gasp meeting at the White House yielded no progress.The gridlocked Congress regularly runs into deadlines to agree on spending plans, and the negotiations are invariably fraught. But Congress usually avoids them ending in shutdowns. Democrats, in the minority in both chambers of Congress, have been seeking to flex their rare leverage over the federal government eight months into Trump's second presidency that has seen entire government agencies dismantled.Trump's threat of new job cuts added to anxieties in the federal workforce sparked by large-scale firings orchestrated by tycoon Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency earlier this year.Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson wrote on X after the shutdown began to ask \"How long will Chuck Schumer let this pain go on -- for his own selfish reasons?\"\"Results: Moms and kids now lose WIC nutrition.

President Donald Trump held a meeting with congressional leaders Monday, but Vice President J.D. Vance said afterward the government appeared headed to a shutdown. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers face furloughs, while active-duty military and law enforcement will continue working without pay until the shutdown ends. To learn more, read today’s full story below.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth and President Donald Trump hosted a meeting Tuesday with senior military officials at a Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in which Hegseth outlined 10 new directives for the military, including stricter physical fitness and grooming standards, with combat troops required to meet the highest male standard on fitness tests, an overhaul of internal oversight offices, and a review of hazing and bullying policies. “No more identity months, DEI offices, dudes in dresses, no more climate change worship, no more division, distraction or gender delusion, no more debris.,” Hegseth said. “I’ve said before and will say again we are done with that s—.” Trump praised the reforms and said his administration has committed to spending more than $1 trillion on the military in 2026, adding that he would fire generals “on the spot” if he disliked them. He also suggested using some U.S. cities as training grounds for the military and National Guard.\n\nAn unknown number of Indonesian students remain trapped under rubble after their school collapsed during afternoon prayers on Monday. Six are confirmed to be alive under the rubble, but at least three students have died, and more than 100 others were injured, with 91 more unaccounted for. Most of the trapped students are boys ages 12-18 and. More than 300 rescuers were working to rescue them.\n\nA magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck near the central Philippines late Tuesday night, killing at least 69 people and injuring nearly 150 others. The shallow quake struck near Bogo City in Cebu Province at 9:59 p.m., collapsing houses and overwhelming the local hospital with casualties. The Philippines sits along the Pacific Ring of Fire, where earthquakes and volcanic activity are common.\n\nAt least 10 people were killed in Pakistan’s Balochistan region on Tuesday following a suicide car bomb explosion outside the headquarters of a paramilitary group. The dead included eight civilians and two paramilitary personnel, and another 33 people were injured. Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said a suicide bomber was driving a pickup truck at the time of the blast, and, in the direct aftermath, four gunmen attempted to storm the paramilitary group’s building, but were shot and killed by security officers. \n\nPolish law enforcement officials arrested a Ukrainian diver suspected of sabotage in the September 2022 explosion of the Nord Stream gas pipeline that runs from Europe to Russia, both the suspect’s lawyer and German prosecutors confirmed on Tuesday. Germany issued an arrest warrant in June 2024 for the suspect, identified only as “Volodymyr Z,” though he has no known connection to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. “My client does not agree with this and says he’s not guilty,” the suspect’s lawyer, Tymoteusz Paprocki, said on Tuesday.\n\nThe White House withdrew its nomination for E.J. Antoni to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics, three sources told CNN Tuesday. Antoni’s nomination faced mounting opposition in the Senate after reports revealed his deleted Twitter account featured sexually degrading attacks on Kamala Harris and conspiracy theories. GOP Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski had declined to meet with Antoni. Trump nominated Antoni in August after firing the previous BLS commissioner over disputes regarding jobs data.\n\nDemocratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation on Tuesday to impose safety regulations on AI companies, including requirements that they document and share their safety protocols with the public, as well as protections for employee whistleblowers. In a statement on Tuesday, Newsom described that bill, S.B. 53, as “first-in-the-nation frontier AI safety legislation that builds public trust as this emerging technology rapidly evolves.” The same day, OpenAI released its new Sora 2 AI video generation model, along with a social media app of the same name, which allows users to generate, remix, and share AI videos. As the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing “people familiar with the matter,” OpenAI had been informing talent agencies and studios that the AI technology in Sora would not request permission to use their work in developing videos, and that entities would have to send the company an opt-out request. \n\nThe Trump administration and pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a deal on Tuesday that both sides said will lower drug prices, and create a website—to be made available later—for consumers to purchase drugs directly from manufacturers, which will be named “TrumpRx.” According to senior administration officials, the White House aims to launch the website by early 2026. Pfizer said in a statement that “the large majority of the Company’s primary care treatments and some select specialty brands will be offered at savings that will range as high as 85% and on average 50%.”\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolás Maduro signed a decree on Monday that would significantly expand his executive authority in the event of an invasion by U.S. forces, giving him the power to mobilize the country’s military, control public services, and oversee oil companies. In a televised address on Monday, Venezuela’s dictator added that he is in the “consultation process” of declaring a state of emergency “should Venezuela be attacked by the U.S. empire.” Citing unnamed U.S. officials, the New York Times had reported that senior Trump administration leaders had considered a plan to oust Maduro from power and that support for such a decision “has intensified in recent days.”\n\nRepublican Gov. Jeff Landry of Louisiana said on Tuesday that he sent a letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, requesting that as many as 1,000 National Guardsmen be activated “to assist with public safety across our state.” If deployed, National Guard troops would assist with logistics and communications work, in addition to assuming law enforcement responsibilities in areas with high crime rates, including cities such as New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Shreveport, the governor said. “Who would not want help in combating criminals on your streets?” Landry told Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Monday. \n\nAfghanistan’s Taliban regime issued a nationwide internet blackout on Monday in what it said was part of a crackdown on “immoral activities.” The ban extended even to cell service, and several flights into its capital city, Kabul, were canceled on Tuesday. One unnamed Taliban official told the Washington Post that the decision has already caused severe strain. “We can’t live without the internet,” he said. “Everything is at a standstill at the moment.”\n\nA federal district judge ruled on Tuesday that the Trump administration’s decision to deport international students for pro-Palestinian activism and anti-Israel sentiments is illegal under the First Amendment. “The effect of these targeted deportation proceedings continues unconstitutionally to chill freedom of speech to this day,” Judge William Young wrote in a 161-page opinion. He further ruled that the administration’s determination of antisemitism was too broad. Later that day, a federal judge disqualified Acting U.S. Attorney Sigal Chattah in Nevada from supervising four criminal cases, ruling that she is not validly serving in that role because her 120-day interim appointment expired in July. The decision marks the second setback for the Trump administration’s efforts to extend the authority of handpicked prosecutors beyond legal limits.","summary":"Congress failed to pass a spending agreement.

Instead, the 87-year-old actor and Vietnam War-era provocateur is as likely to be seen knocking on voters’ doors in Phoenix on a balmy summer afternoon as sashaying down a red carpet at a glitzy movie premiere. Politically active for more than a half-century, Fonda is now focusing her energy, celebrity, connections and resources on fighting climate change and combating the \"existential crises\" created by President Trump. Calling fossil fuels a threat to humanity, Fonda created JanePAC, a political action committee that has spent millions on candidates at the forefront of that fight. “Nature has always been in my bones, in my cells,” Fonda said in a recent interview, describing herself as an environmentalist since her tomboy youth. “And then, about 10 years ago … I started reading more, and I realized what we're doing to the climate, which means what we're doing to us, what we're doing to the future, to our grandchildren and our children. \"Our existence is being challenged all because an industry, the fossil-fuel industry, wants to make more money,\" she said. \"I mean, I try to understand what, what must they think when they go to sleep at night? These men, they're destroying everything.” Rather than hosting fancy political fundraisers or headlining presidential campaign rallies, Fonda devotes her efforts to electing like-minded state legislators, city council members, utility board officials and candidates in other less flashy but critical races. Fonda said her organization took its cue from successful GOP tactics. \"I hate to say this, but you know, in terms of playing the long game, the Republicans have been better than the Democrats,\" she said. \"They started to work down ballot, and they took over state legislatures. They took over governorships and mayors and city councils, boards of supervisors, and before we knew what had happened, they had power on the grassroots level.\" Fonda said her PAC selects candidates to back based on their climate-change record and viability. The beneficiaries include candidates running for state legislature and city council. Some of the races are often obscure, such as the Silver River Project board (an Arizona utility), the Port of Bellingham commission in Washington and the Lane Community College board in Oregon. \"Down ballot, if you come in, especially for primaries, you can really make a difference. You know, not all Democrats are the same,\" she said. \"We want candidates who have shown public courage in standing up to fossil fuels. We want candidates who can win. We're not a protest PAC. We're in it to win it.\" Since her birth, Fonda's life has been infused by political activism. Her father, the late actor Henry Fonda, witnessed the lynching of a Black man during the 1919 Omaha race riots when he was 14, casting him into becoming a lifelong liberal. Though such matters were not discussed at the dinner table, Fonda’s father raised money for Democratic candidates and starred in politically imbued films such as “The Grapes of Wrath,” about the exploitation of migrant workers during the Dust Bowl, and “12 Angry Men,” which focused on prejudice, groupthink and the importance of due process during the McCarthy era. But his daughter Jane did not become politically active until her early 30s. “Before then, I kind of led a life of ignorance, somewhat hedonistic,” she said. “Maybe deep down, I knew that once I know something, I can't turn away.” In “Prime Time,” Fonda's 2011 memoir, she describes the final chapter of her life as a time of “coming to fruition rather than simply a period of marking time, or the absence of youth.” “Unlike during childhood, Act III is a quiet ripening. It takes time and experience, and yes, perhaps the inevitable slowing down,” she wrote. “You have to learn to sort out what’s fundamentally important to you from what’s irrelevant.” In 1972, Fonda appeared in Jean-Luc Godard's film \"Tout Va Bien,\" about workers' rights in the aftermath of widespread street protests in France four years earlier. It was her first role in a political movie and coincided with her off-screen move into activism. Fonda's most noteworthy and reviled political moment occurred the same year, when she was photographed by the North Vietnamese sitting atop an antiaircraft gun. The images led to Fonda being tarred as “Hanoi Jane” and a traitor to the United States, which had deployed millions of American soldiers to Southeast Asia, many of whom never returned. Fonda says it is something she “will regret to my dying day.” “It is possible that it was a setup, that the Vietnamese had it all planned,” Fonda wrote in 2011. “I will never know. But if they did, I can’t blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen. It was my mistake.” Fonda married liberal activist Tom Hayden in 1973. He served in the California Legislature for 18 years and was a force in Democratic politics until his death in 2016. Fonda's political beliefs have been a through line in her Hollywood career. In 1979, she played a reporter in \"The China Syndrome,\" a film about a fictional meltdown at a nuclear power plant near Los Angeles. The movie's theatrical release occurred less than two weeks before the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. The 1980 movie \"9 to 5,\" starring Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton, was a biting comedy that highlighted the treatment of women in the workplace and income inequality long before such issues were routinely discussed in workplaces. Two years later, as home VCRs grew popular, Fonda created exercise videos that shattered sales records. She urged women to \"feel the burn,\" and revenue from the videos funded the Campaign for Economic Democracy, a political action committee founded by Fonda and Hayden. This year, Fonda offered signed copies to donors to JanePAC, which she created in 2022. \"I'm still in shock that those leg warmers and leotards caught on the way they did,\" Fonda wrote to supporters in April. \"If you've ever done one of my leg lifts, or even thought about doing one, now's your chance to own a piece of that history.\" UCLA lecturer Jim Newton, a veteran Los Angeles Times political journalist and historian of the state's politics, described Fonda as confrontational, controversial and unapologetic. \"She's remarkable, utterly admirable, a principled person who has devoted her life to fighting for what she believes in,\" said Newton, who quotes Fonda in his new book, \"Here Beside the Rising Tide: Jerry Garcia, the Grateful Dead, and an American Awakening.\" Newton added that Fonda's outspoken nature certainly harmed her career. \"I'm sure that there are directors, producers, whatnot, especially in the '70s and '80s, who passed on chances to work with her because of her politics,\" he said. \"And I'm sure she knew that, right? She did it. It's not been without sacrifice. She's true to herself, like very few people.\" A year after Fonda and Hayden divorced in 1990, she married CNN founder and philanthropist Ted Turner, who she once described as \"my favorite ex-husband.\" Though Fonda largely paused her acting career during their decade-long marriage, she remained politically active. In 1995, Fonda founded a Georgia effort dedicated to reducing teenage pregnancy. Five years later, she launched the Jane Fonda Center for Reproductive Health at Emory University. After Fonda and Turner divorced, she worked with Tomlin on raising the minimum wage in Michigan and then launched Fire Drill Fridays — acts of civil disobedience — with Greenpeace in 2019. Fonda said she decided to create her political action committee after facing headwinds persuading Gov. Gavin Newsom to create setbacks for oil wells in 2020. \"He wasn't moving on it, and somebody very high up in his campaign said to us, 'You can have millions of people in your organization all over California, but you don't have a big enough carrot or stick to move the governor. ... You don't have an electoral strategy,'\" Fonda recalled. \"Since we've started the PAC, it's interesting how politicians deal with us differently. They know that we've got money. They know that we have tens of thousands of volunteers all over the country.\" Initially concentrated on climate change, JanePAC has expanded its focus since Trump was reelected in November. \"We're facing two existential crises, climate and democracy, and it's now or never for both,\" Fonda said. \"We can't have a stable democracy with an unstable climate, and we can't have a stable climate unless we have a democracy, And so we have to fight both together.\" Fonda’s PAC has raised more than $9 million since its creation through June 30, according to the Federal Election Commission. In 2024, JanePAC supported 154 campaigns and won 96 of those races. The committee gave nearly $700,000 directly to campaigns and helped raise more than $1.1 million for their endorsed candidates and ballot measures. In 2025, they have endorsed 63 campaigns and plan to soon launch get-out-the-vote efforts in support of Proposition 50, Newsom's ballot measure to redraw California's congressional districts that will appear on the November ballot. Arizona state Rep. Oscar De Los Santos, the minority leader in the state's House of Representatives, recalled Fonda's support during the 2024 election, not only for his reelection bid but also a broader effort to try to win Democratic control of the state Legislature. In addition to raising $500,000 at a Phoenix event for candidates, De Los Santos recalled the actor spending days knocking on Arizona voters' doors. \"It is a moral validator to have Jane Fonda support your campaigns, especially at a time when corporate interests have more money and more power than ever, having somebody in your corner who's been on the right side of history for decades,\" said De Los Santos, who represents a south Phoenix district deeply affected by environmental justice issues. Voters are often stunned when Fonda shows up on their doorstep. \"I've had people walking out of their laundry room and dropping all the laundry,\" Fonda said with a laugh. But others don't know who she is and Fonda doesn't tell them. \"It's amazing. You wouldn't think that in just a few minutes on someone's doorstep, you can really find out a lot,\" Fonda said, recalling discovering her love of canvassing when she was married to Hayden.\"I loved talking to people and finding out what they care about and what they're scared of and what they're angry about.\" Fonda does not walk in lockstep with the Democratic party. In 2023, she joined other climate-change activists protesting a big-money Joe Biden fundraiser. They argued that the then-president had strayed from the environmental promises he made when he ran for election, such as by approving a massive oil drilling project on the North Slope of Alaska. Fonda said she supported Biden's 2024 reelection despite disagreeing with some of his policies because of the threat she believed Trump poses. \"When you see what the choice was, of course you're going to vote,\" she said. \"I get so mad at people who say, you know, 'I don't like him, so I'm not going to vote.' [A] young person said to me, we already have fascism. They don't know history. You know, we don't teach civics anymore, so they don't understand that what's happening now is leading to fascism. I mean, this is real tyranny.\" But she also faulted Biden and then-Vice President Kamala Harris after she became the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, as well as 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, for failing to speak to the economic pain being experienced by Americans who backed Trump. \"They're not all MAGA,\" she said. Many were just angry and hurting, she said, because they couldn't afford groceries or pay medical bills. Fonda believes many now have buyer's remorse. Fonda reflected on the parallels between the turmoil in the 1960s and today. In the interview, which took place before the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, she argued that today's political climate is more perilous. \"I'm not sure that what we have right now in the U.S. is a democracy,\" she said. \"It's far graver. Far, far graver now than it was.\" Fonda said she remains driven, not by blind optimism, but by immersing herself in work that she believes makes a difference. \"This is what I'm going to be doing for the rest of my life,\" she said.","summary":"Politically active for more than a half-century, actor Jane Fonda is now focusing her energy, celebrity, connections and resources on fighting climate change and combating the \"existential crises\" created by President Trump.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-01/jane-fonda-hanoi-vietnam-war-democrat-politics-climate-change-trump","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6f74e43/2147483647/strip/false/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5f%2F2e%2Faf21919044fa8d46fae868aa4857%2F1515645-pol-jane-fond","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 10:00:00","author":"Seema Mehta","authors":["Seema Mehta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.144},{"id":365173576,"title":"So You Don’t Understand Crypto. Buckle Up.","text":"The growth of crypto—decentralized digital currency that doesn’t rely on the backing of a bank or government—is one of the most transformative financial developments of the 21st century. And yet cryptocurrencies still baffle so many. How risky of an investment is it? Where do I buy it? And, wait, what is crypto again?\n\nOn this week’s More To The Story, host Al Letson sits down with independent journalist Molly White for some answers. She examines the growth of cryptocurrency in the US, how digital currencies have begun permeating American politics, and the extreme risks and rewards of investing in crypto as the Trump administration is deregulating the industry.\n\n“We see these crypto bubbles happen over and over again, where crypto companies get very high, cryptocurrency companies proliferate, and everyday people are being increasingly brought into crypto,” White says. “And then things get out of hand because there’s very little oversight and bad behavior is very common. And at a certain point, things get untenable.”\n\nWhite also recounts the epic rise and fall of FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange started by Sam Bankman-Fried, who was convicted of fraud in 2023. FTX’s collapse and ensuing bankruptcy is the focus of Reveal’s new two-part series, The Secret Story of FTX’s Rise and Ruin.\n\nThis following interview was edited for length and clarity. More To The Story transcripts are produced by a third-party transcription service and may contain errors.\n\nSo before we get too deep, I’d love to start off with the fundamentals, so what exactly is cryptocurrency and Bitcoin?\n\nSo cryptocurrency is a digital asset, meaning that it exists entirely in the digital world, there’s no physical representation of the asset, and people trade these assets, like Bitcoin or various other crypto assets, to try to speculate on the price, hoping that these very volatile assets will increase in price. They were created in 2009 or so with the advent of Bitcoin, which was the first cryptocurrency, but now there are thousands and thousands of them that people trade back and forth in hopes of earning a profit typically.\n\nAnd so, what exactly is a blockchain and how does that relate to cryptocurrency?\n\nThe blockchain is the ledger on which all of these transactions are recorded. So this is basically a distributed, decentralized record of every transaction that happens, say, with a Bitcoin. And so, there is this system in which anyone can run one of these computers and contribute to maintaining this digital ledger, without, say, a centralized entity, like a bank, keeping track of every transaction or acting as a middleman in those transactions.\n\nOkay, I think I grasp all of that. It’s a way of keeping big institutions, banks, out of the mix, so to speak.\n\nRight. The idea is that a ton of different people will all contribute to maintaining this ledger, but no single person or entity controls that ledger, and so there is no bank telling you, “Oh, sorry, you can’t make that transaction,” for whatever reason, that was the original design of cryptocurrencies. Since then, it has evolved quite a lot, and so now there actually are a lot of intermediaries in the crypto world, but the fundamental design was to cut them out of the mix.\n\nSo right now, we’re in the middle of reporting on the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which at one time was valued at more than $30 billion. You’ve also done a lot of reporting about FTX, including about the way customers were paid out as part of the bankruptcy. Can you talk some about that?\n\nYeah. So this has been a bone of contention in a number of crypto bankruptcies, where instead of having their assets returned to them in the form that they had been holding them, people are being repaid with the dollar equivalent of those assets based on the time at which the company went bankrupt, and for FTX, this was an all-time low in crypto prices, there had been a very tumultuous year in the crypto industry, and so Bitcoin prices were low, other crypto asset prices were low. And now, years later, as creditors are being repaid, they would much rather get their Bitcoin back because those Bitcoins are worth many times what they were worth at the time of bankruptcy, but instead they’re being repaid in dollars, which means that they’ve lost a significant amount of value than if they had managed to hold onto their crypto assets for that time. But this is the risk that people take when they get involved in crypto, when they store assets on exchanges like FTX, is that there really aren’t protections that are ensuring that people get the outcome that they wish when catastrophes happen.\n\nIf the US had a better system in place, could that have prevented things like FTX crumbling?\n\nYeah. I think that there were regulatory failures that contributed to both FTX’s business operations, that were extremely high risk, that were very much out of the norm for a traditional financial institution, and issues that led to creditors not being repaid in ways that they maybe expected.\n\nThere has been very limited oversight of crypto firms like FTX, in part because FTX was based offshore, and so although they did have a branch of the company that was serving US customers, much of the company and its operations were not necessarily subject to US oversight, and there were very little regulations, like you see in traditional finance, that would aim to prevent the types of conflicts of interest that happened with FTX and its sister trading firm, which was called Alameda Research. Typically, you wouldn’t want a company that is holding customer funds to also be engaging in trading activities that could potentially be trading against those very same customers, you would want a very significant firewall around customer assets so that a company could not misuse those assets for their own expenditures or trading purposes, and those types of protections really were not in place, they did not prevent FTX from doing exactly that, which I think contributed to its downfall.\n\nSince the collapse of FTX, how has crypto entered the bloodstream of American finance and investment?\n\nWell, it’s been a pretty remarkable turnaround, I think, in the crypto world. After FTX, I think people were very disillusioned with cryptocurrency, especially the everyday person rather than the crypto enthusiast, they saw crypto as very high risk, not worth getting involved in, they saw FTX as a cautionary tale. But over the couple of years since then, crypto has really re-emerged in the American system as a major portion of the financial world, where we’re seeing big companies, traditional financial companies, embracing crypto. There are companies like Fidelity that have issued crypto ETFs, which are a way for people to essentially gain exposure to crypto assets through a traditional brokerage. We’ve seen a massive embrace of cryptocurrency from the President and the President’s administration, where the crypto industry has become very, very close with not only the President, but also the regulatory structure, and has exerted quite a lot of influence over upcoming legislation over the regulatory approach. And so, crypto has really reinserted itself, I would say, into the American consciousness as crypto prices have come back up and there has been this embrace of cryptocurrency from the political administration.\n\nSo if I wanted to buy crypto today, how risky of an investment is it?\n\nWell, crypto is still a very risky investment for a couple of reasons. For one, it’s risky in the sense that crypto is extremely volatile, and so there are these huge swings in price, even in some of the most established cryptocurrencies. We see Bitcoin, for example, dramatically changing in price, both up and down. And so, there is risk in that sense, that you might put a lot of money into Bitcoin, and then the price goes down and you lose a considerable portion of your original investment.\n\nBut there are also risks in the crypto worlds that people are maybe not as used to from more traditional institutions, where you can actually lose all of your crypto assets, they can be stolen from you, or companies can go under and your assets may not be returned to you ever, or if they are returned, it can be much, much later or in a different form, and those risks, I think, are still fairly significant, even as companies try to present themselves as more legitimate versions of exchanges, like FTX.\n\nWhen FTX was still doing business, they very much branded themselves as the safe and easy place to trade crypto. They tried to portray themselves as a place where you didn’t have to worry about the custody of your crypto assets, you could just log on to the exchange and they’d be right there. They tried to create trust among their customers that they were the legitimate, above board way of trading crypto, because FTX was not the first catastrophe in the crypto world, people had grown concerned about the legitimacy of these exchanges even prior to FTX.And so nowadays, we’re seeing other cryptocurrency exchanges doing the same thing, where they claim that, “Okay, for real this time, we’re the place where we will actually take care of your assets and protect you,” but without much oversight still, and as the crypto industry is actually being deregulated rather than regulated, I remain very skeptical and cautious about those types of companies, because we see these catastrophes happening again and again and again, and without some sort of external force or oversight to stop that pattern, I think it will just repeat.\n\nSo Molly, another part of your research and reporting is the influence of cryptocurrency in politics, how did crypto affect the 2024 elections?\n\nThe crypto industry became incredibly politically active in 2024, and this had been happening over a period of a couple of years, where crypto firms, including FTX, actually, were becoming very politically active and trying to influence legislation and regulators so that they would have a more friendly environment under which to operate. But they really went into overdrive in 2024, where a coalition of cryptocurrency companies and executives raised over $100 million, they spent something like $130 million on congressional elections in the United States to either support candidates that they believed would be pro-crypto and who would support the legislation that the crypto industry wanted to see put into place.\n\nBut also to oppose candidates that they saw as threats to the crypto industry, people like Katie Porter in California, who lost her primary race for the California Senate seat, she was viewed as a ally of Elizabeth Warren, as someone who was maybe going to be skeptical of the crypto industry’s promises and its plans for a much looser regulatory regime. And so, they spent millions of dollars to unseat people like her, or Sherrod Brown in Ohio, and instead replace them with politicians who would be much friendlier to the crypto industry and would vote for legislation that they essentially drafted.\n\nWhat kind of influence is crypto having on the upcoming midterms?\n\nWell, we saw an incredible degree of crypto spending in the 2024 elections, and I think we are poised to see that again in 2026. The cryptocurrency Super PACs have already raised a significant amount of money, rivaling what they raised in 2024, and they’re continuing to accumulate funds to spend in the midterms. There’s already been some spending happening in special elections and other races that have happened a little bit earlier, and I think we will continue to see that even more so into the midterms as the crypto industry continues to exert influence.\n\nThe strategy last time was essentially to show force against candidates who might be skeptical of cryptocurrency or even just unwilling to sign on to the crypto industry agenda and essentially threaten them and say, “We will spend you out of office. We will support your opponents, and we will make sure that they are elected rather than you, unless get on board with our agenda.” And so, some people decided to acquiesce, they embraced cryptocurrency. Others were indeed up against huge spending, where their opponents were backed by the crypto industry because the industry didn’t want to see a skeptic or someone who is more focused on consumer protection put into office. So I think we’re going to see that pattern again, where candidates are being strong armed into at least going along with the crypto industry’s agenda, if not outwardly embracing it, in hopes of earning potentially millions and millions of dollars in campaign support.\n\nYeah. When you’ve got a candidate like Trump, who I think it’s fair to say has made a lot of money off of crypto, versus a candidate who maybe is not doing as much for the cryptocurrency, it’s clear where their alliance is going to go.\n\nI think so. There was this perception from the crypto industry that the Biden administration was very anti-crypto, that it was because of Biden that we saw more enforcement in the crypto world, and there was this belief, or certainly the crypto industry contributed to this belief, that Kamala Harris would be an extension of that, and so if you supported her, you would essentially be putting your crypto assets at risk. Whereas Trump very much positioned himself as an ally to the crypto industry, he was describing himself as the pro-crypto president, he was launching his own tokens, he was building businesses where he was personally profiting from cryptocurrency. And so, I think many executives in the crypto world saw him as the obvious choice, because he wants to get rich from cryptocurrency, and so he will support policies that will allow anyone to get rich from running a cryptocurrency business, and they very much threw their lot in with Donald Trump as a result of that.\n\nWhat’s Trump’s involvement with World Liberty Financial? It seems like he and his family have made large investments and have their own family token.\n\nRight. So the Trump family has a whole portfolio of cryptocurrency companies and crypto-related investments at this point. World Liberty Financial was one of the first ones, and this was a project that was launched by the Trump sons, in collaboration with a couple of other crypto entrepreneurs, and the whole selling point was that they were going to create their own cryptocurrency trading platform that would address what they describe as debanking that they’ve experienced personally.\n\nSo the Trump sons have said that in the past, they were denied banking services due to their political beliefs, due to their family associations, and they see crypto as the way to answer that, where no bank can deny you service because it’s decentralized and you can just set up an account and go about your business, and that was the ideology behind World Liberty Financial. Although, the company so far has not actually launched anything besides a token called WLFI, from which the Trump family has made hundreds of millions of dollars. They’ve also launched a stablecoin called USD1, which is, again, a crypto asset that is pegged to the US dollar, that has also been very lucrative for them. But so far, the actual promises of the platform have yet to be realized.\n\nBefore we move on, I’m still having a hard time understanding exactly what a meme coin is. So a meme coin is just digital currency that somebody creates based around a meme, and those can have dramatic swings in how much they’re worth, is that correct?\n\nYes, that’s absolutely correct. Meme coins often start at extremely low prices, and then as interest is drawn to them, people are always looking for the next new meme coin, and so if someone is able to get some attention on a meme coin, it can spike in price, even if we’re talking about many, many fractions of a penny to a penny, and because of that, people try to make huge returns on them, even though often those spikes are very short-lived and people often lose a substantial amount of money trying to speculate on the next big meme coin. That is the model of meme coins is to pick the right one early and then hopefully make a profit.\n\nSo it’s like pick the right one, get in early and get out early as well, make the money in balance?\n\nRight. And the people who are a little bit late to that party are the people who lose a lot of money, because they allow those early purchasers to get out with their profits.\n\nSo is this the same type of thing that the Hawk Tuah girl, I have no idea what her real name is, the Hawk Tuah woman did, she created her own meme coin, is that what it was?\n\nYep, that’s exactly right.\n\nSo she created a meme coin, and everybody got mad at her because she made a lot of money, or the people that were working with her made a lot of money, but everybody that came later to it kind of got screwed?\n\nRight. And that is actually the most common trajectory for a meme coin, is the insiders who launch the token are the ones who make money, and everyone who comes in later tends to lose money. And there’s very little oversight or regulations around how meme coins are supposed to work, but people still get very angry when they perceive that the person who launched or endorsed a meme coin did it in the wrong way that caused them to lose money.\n\nSo let me ask you a really basic question then, if that’s the way it goes, why invest in a meme coin? I don’t understand. If you know that it’s an inside job, why invest in it? I’m really truly trying to understand.\n\nYeah. I think a lot of crypto investing is really not terribly rational. There is a lot of hope that they’re going to be one of those early buyers and they’re going to be the ones who make the money and not the ones who are allowing the insiders to make the money. In reality, it’s often not the case, and oftentimes, especially with meme coins, they are set up in such a way that you could never make money off of them, because the insiders just have a structural advantage that is not available to everyday people who are coming in later to purchase these tokens. But I think people get really hopeful. They see stories about a person just picking the right token and suddenly they’re a millionaire overnight, and they think that could be me, I just have to pick the right one. And sometimes they lose over and over and over again, and they get very upset when that is not happening for them, even if it’s not an entirely rational behavior.\n\nIs there a safe strategy with crypto in general? I’m pulling out from meme coins, because it seems like what we’re saying with meme coins is it seems like it is the extreme Wild West, you’re almost playing the lottery, hoping that something will work out. Is there a crypto strategy that is a little bit more stable?\n\nWell, staying out of it is certainly the safest option, I think.\n\nThat’s what I’m planning to do, I’ll just-\n\nYeah, that’s been my strategy as well.\n\nMy kid though is very much into crypto, so I’m just curious, is there another path?\n\nYeah, I think there are ways that people work to minimize risk. I think that some people view cryptocurrency as what it is, which is an extremely high risk investment choice, and they see that maybe there is some room in their portfolio for that type of asset, and so they allocate a small percentage of their investment strategy towards crypto, maybe they stick to some of the more mainstream coins, maybe they take custody of their assets personally so that they don’t have to worry about an exchange going under.\n\nBut ultimately, anyone who is involved in crypto speculation is taking on a significant amount of risk, both in the sense that it’s very volatile and it’s high risk in the sense that maybe high risk investments outside of crypto can be high risk. But there is also this additional layer of risk in crypto that people I think often don’t recognize, which is that, typically, if you buy a high risk stock, you can at least be sure that that stock is going to be in your brokerage account the next time you check, whereas in the crypto world, it is actually very common for companies to go under or for crypto exchanges to be hacked and have assets stolen. And so, that amount of risk is also a factor, and people maybe don’t recognize that quite as much.\n\nYou, like me, sound very skeptical about crypto. I would say I’m skeptical about crypto out of ignorance, I don’t know enough about this stuff, so I’m just like, yeah, I’ll keep my money. You sound skeptical about crypto with an abundance of knowledge. I’m curious though, what’s the flip side of it, why are there crypto enthusiasts, people who absolutely believe that this is the way of the future?\n\nI would say it’s a mix of different ideologies that abound in crypto enthusiasts. Some of it is very ideological, and so it ties back to the early goals of crypto, which was to remove banks from the equation or make sure that governments were not even involved in issuing the asset. There are a lot of people who are digital equivalents of gold bugs, who think that we should have never left the gold standard, and they see Bitcoin as a similar asset class to gold because it has a limited supply, and so they think that it is a superior currency from a structural level.\n\nThere are a lot of people who love cryptocurrency because they think it’s their ticket to getting rich quick. There have been people who have made their fortunes in Bitcoin or other crypto assets because they got in early and they made a lot of money, and so people see those stories and they think, that could be me. And so, they get involved in crypto speculation, hoping for the same results. And then, I think there are people who have really bought into the idea that blockchains are a superior technology to the banking rails that we use today. That one, I think, I find the least convincing, just because the technological promises of blockchains have been fairly limited, and we’ve seen how little progress there has been towards making Bitcoin or some other crypto asset the currency of the future. But there are people who still believe that we just need a couple more years and it’ll be right around the corner.\n\nWhat do you think is the future of regulation for cryptocurrency? Is it going to always be this lawless place?\n\nWell, I think that remains to be seen. But we’ve certainly seen a lot of pressure in the United States to avoid regulations for the crypto industry, to even remove regulations that were in place, the few regulations that were being enforced prior to the Trump administration. And so, I think at least for the next couple of years, we’re going to see very little in the way of regulations, at least in the sense of regulations that protect consumers or prevent these businesses from engaging in abusive behaviors.\n\nI think the regulations that are being put in place and that are coming out of the cryptocurrency industry, which often claims that it actually wants regulation, are solely regulations that benefit the cryptocurrency industry and the wealthy executives running these companies. They are not the types of protections that you would hope to see in financial institutions to ensure that they’re being fair and that customers are being protected. And so, I think that will be the trend, at least in the near future.\n\nBut I think we’ve also seen throughout history that what happens in the cryptocurrency world is that things get very, very inflated, we see these crypto bubbles happen over and over again, where crypto prices get very high, cryptocurrency companies proliferate and everyday people are being increasingly brought into crypto, and then things get out of hand, because there’s very little oversight and bad behavior is very common, and at a certain point, things get untenable. And so, we see catastrophes like we saw in 2022, when many, many, many companies collapsed, not just FTX, FTX was certainly the most high profile, but there were tons and tons of crypto companies that went under because they were engaging in very risky lending or they were outright frauds that eventually reached the end of their line. And so, a lot of people lost a ton of money, crypto prices came crashing back down. That is a cycle that we’ve seen over and over again in the cryptocurrency world, and I worry that it will only continue and become more dramatic as the sector continues to expand.\n\nAnd so, I do think, unfortunately, there may be this natural boundary to the extent to which the crypto industry can grow under such a deregulated administration, and at some point, it will unfortunately self-correct in a way that is very, very painful for everyday people.\n\nFind More To The Story on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, iHeartRadio, Pandora, or your favorite podcast app, and don’t forget to subscribe.","summary":"The growth of crypto—decentralized digital currency that doesn’t rely on the backing of a bank or government—is one of the most transformative financial developments of the 21st century.

That evening in San Antonio, he told me, “I really wanted to show up not as the politician, but as the pastor.” In truth, he was a bit of both. People are hungry, he told the crowd, “for a different kind of politics. Not a politics of fear, not a politics of hate, not a politics of violence, but a politics of love.”\n\nAfterward, he announced that he’d stay long enough to speak one-on-one with anyone who wanted to, and a snaking line formed. Some, including a couple of families with young kids, asked him to pray with them.\n\nTalarico is an underdog in the Texas Senate Democratic primary, where polls show him running behind Colin Allred, who challenged Senator Ted Cruz in 2024. That gap might close as more people get to know Talarico; a September Public Policy Polling survey found that among those who had a favorable opinion of both him and Allred, Talarico led by a significant 50 percentage points. But cinching the nomination would be the easy part, given that no Democrat has won statewide office in Texas in over 30 years.\n\nYet Talarico, a 36-year-old former middle-school teacher and a member of the Texas House of Representatives, is generating excitement far out of proportion to his political prospects.

In July they earned him an invitation to Joe Rogan’s podcast, perhaps the most coveted platform in American politics, where Rogan encouraged him to run for president.

Eighteen months ago, just 12% of Democrats agreed; now, 28% do.\n\nBut, still, a slightly higher percentage of Republicans — 31% — also say Americans may have to resort to violence. That's also up 3 points since last year. (Independents have also increased from 18% to 25%.)\n\nThe findings come after a string of high-profile acts of political violence, including the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk last month.\n\nThree-quarters of people — 77% — described political violence as a major concern. Respondents are split, however, on whether they're more concerned with violence toward public officials (49%) or protesters (50%).\n\nHere, there's a very sharp political divide — 70% of Democrats said protesters, 74% of Republicans said public officials.\n\nThe survey of more than 1,400 people nationwide was conducted over five days last week. Respondents were reached in various ways, by phone, cell and landline, online and via text in both English and Spanish. It has a +/- 3.1 percentage point margin of error, meaning results could be roughly 3 points higher or lower.\n\nThe survey was wide-ranging, showing that:\n\nmost think the country is going in the wrong direction;a majority believes the country has gone too far in restricting free speech;there's a sharp partisan divide on whether the National Guard should be deployed to cities to curb crime;the overwhelming majority believe children should be vaccinated before being allowed to go to school;controlling gun violence is more important than protecting gun rights;and the files on the late financier/convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein should be released.\n\nAmericans still sour on direction of the country, but partisanship is notable\n\nBy a 62%-to-38% margin, respondents said they believe the country is headed in the wrong direction.\n\nBut, with Donald Trump as president, Republicans are far more positive about the direction of the country compared to last year when Joe Biden was president.\n\nConsider that in an October 2024 New York Times/Siena poll that asked a similar question, 9 in 10 Republicans said the country was headed in the wrong direction. Now, almost 8 in 10 said it's going in the right direction.\n\nThe reversal was evident with Democrats, too, but not quite as sharply. In October, 54% of Democrats thought the country was headed in the right direction. Now, 90% say it's going the wrong way.\n\nIndependents feel similarly to the way they did last year, but are 6 points higher in saying the country is headed in the wrong direction now (68%).\n\nA whopping 79% think the country has gone too far in restricting speech.\n\nThat crosses political lines, with 88% of Democrats, 86% of independents and 64% of Republicans saying so.\n\nPeople also believe the federal government should play a minimal role in regulating speech. Just 15% said they think the government should play a major role in doing so. Another 44% said it should only play a minor role, and 41% said it should play no role at all.\n\nThe numbers were similar across political parties, but with Trump as president Republicans were more likely than Democrats or independents to say the government should play a major role — 22% of Republicans said that, while just 13% of Democrats and 11% of independents agreed.\n\nRespondents also said by a wide margin that the Supreme Court should be responsible for defining what speech is considered unacceptable or too extreme — 62% said that compared to 26% for Congress and 11% for the president.\n\nThere was a sharp partisan split on support for the deployment of the National Guard in local communities to reduce crime or assist local law enforcement.\n\nOverall, by a 52%-47% margin, respondents said they support it in trying to reduce crime, but three-quarters of Democrats oppose the effort (60% strongly). A majority of independents (56%) also oppose, but 89% of Republicans are in favor.\n\nThe numbers were nearly identical on assisting law enforcement.\n\nWide support for requiring vaccines for children before entering school, but not as strongly among Republicans\n\nThe overwhelming majority — 82% — support requiring children to be vaccinated against certain diseases, such as measles, mumps and rubella, before attending public school.\n\nThat includes 71% of Republicans, but they believe so far less strongly than Democrats and independents. For example, 77% of those who voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024 felt strongly that children should be vaccinated, while only 30% of Trump voters did.\n\nMost say controlling gun violence is more important than protecting gun rights\n\nRoughly 6 in 10 said they believe that controlling gun violence is more important than protecting gun rights. But, like on many issues, Democrats and independents feel one way — 90% and 63%, respectively, said controlling gun violence is more important — while Republicans overwhelmingly feel another way. Three-quarters of Republicans said protecting gun rights is more important.\n\nThere was a notable split, however, among a key Trump base group — white voters without college degrees. White men without degrees were 58% in favor of protecting gun rights, a majority white women without degrees (56%), on the other hand, said controlling gun violence was more important.\n\nHigh disapproval of Trump's handling of the Epstein files\n\nBy a 61%-20% margin, respondents said they disapprove of how the Trump administration is handling the files related to the death of Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender who died by suicide while in prison six years ago.\n\nThat included almost 9 in 10 Democrats and 7 in 10 independents. Republicans, though, were more split — 45% approved, 25% didn't and 30% said they don't know enough to say.\n\nBut two-thirds of Republicans (and 77% of respondents overall) said they support releasing all the files with the names of victims redacted. So they appear to be giving Trump the benefit of the doubt to do what they think should happen — eventually.","summary":"On hot button issues, a majority say children should be vaccinated; controlling gun violence is more important than gun rights; and Epstein files should be released, in a new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/01/nx-s1-5558304/poll-political-violence-free-speech-vaccines-national-guard-epstein-trump","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/937x702+345+83/resize/937x702!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4a%2F99%2Fea5a45f24cc3b7164379f703123b%2Fmarist-poll-20250930.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 09:00:00","author":"Domenico Montanaro","authors":["Domenico Montanaro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.202},{"id":365123214,"title":"Donald Trump’s Approval Rating Dramatically Shifts With Gen Z","text":"The proportion of Gen Z adults who approve of President Donald Trump has increased, according to a new poll.\n\nAs per new polling by AtlasIntel, Trump’s approval rating among this group, classed as adults ages 18 to 29, has improved by 35 percentage points in two months.\n\nNewsweek contacted the White House by email outside of normal business hours to comment on this story.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nYoung people tend to swing toward the Democrats in elections, but a conservative shift among Gen Z voters proved key to Trump’s success in the November 2024 elections. \n\nAccording to AP VoteCast, voters ages 18 to 29 supported then Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump by 51 percent to 47 percent. This was a narrower margin than in 2020, when Joe Biden carried the same age group by 61 percent to Trump’s 36 percent.\n\nIf this trend continues, Republicans may enjoy more success in future elections. And the Democrats, in turn, may struggle to regain lost ground. This will be of particularly importance in November 2026, when voters head to the midterm elections.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump listens to a reporter’s question during a bilateral meeting with President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky at the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) at the UN headquarters on September 23, 2025 in New York City.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nIn AtlasIntel’s July polling, 35 percent of Gen Z adults said they approved of Trump while 65 percent said they disapproved of him, leaving him with a net approval rating of -30 percentage points.\n\nBy September, 49 percent said they approved of Trump while 44 percent said they disapproved, giving him a net approval rating of +5 percentage points.\n\nThe July poll, conducted between July 13 and July 18, had a margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points. The September poll was conducted between September 12 and September 16 and had a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.\n\nThe AtlasIntel polling follows April findings by the Yale Institution for Social and Political Studies, which found that voters aged 18 to 21 lean Republican by 11.7 points when asked who they would support in the 2026 Congressional elections.\n\nMeanwhile, in July, YouGov/The Economist polling found that Trump’s favorability among Gen Z was on the up. His net approval among this group stood a -28 percent percentage points, an improvement on July when this figure was -38.\n\nHowever, Trump’s popularity differs among various age groups, recent polls show. New polling by The Economist/YouGov says Trump’s net approval rating among millennials, roughly those born from 1981 to 1996, plunged by 14 percentage points in the last month.\n\nAs for the next eldest generation, Gen X, according to a July CNN/SSRS survey, Trump’s popularity had increased by 23 points since April with voters aged 50 to 66.\n\nMeanwhile, it comes amid broader negative polling about the President. A recent Echelon Insights poll, conducted between September 18-22, showed that Trump’s disapproval rating had jumped from 51 percent to 53 percent since last month, while his approval rating was down two points to 45 percent. Overall, his net approval dropped by four points.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nSpeaking to Newsweek, Lucas Walsh, a youth political behavior expert and professor at Monash University in Australia said: “While Gen Z is often characterised as progressive and diverse, recent polling that shows a share of younger voters leaning toward Donald Trump might be less about ideology and more about frustration, survival, and distrust.”\n\nHe added: “Gen Z’s turn toward Trump might reflect not ideological alignment, but economic anxiety, disaffection, and deep distrust in democratic institutions. For a generation living in great uncertainty—from the GFC to COVID to cost-of-living pressures—Trump’s disruptive appeal offers both a protest and a sense of control.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nAs his presidency continues, Trump’s favorability among different demographics is likely to fluctuate. The extent to which he commands broad support will be tested when voters head to the midterm elections in November 2026.","summary":"According to a new poll, Trump&#039;s approval rating among Gen Z voters has improved by 35 percentage points in two months.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-approval-rating-dramatically-shifts-with-gen-z-10798709","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2236958610_c868be.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 09:00:00","author":"Kate Plummer","authors":["Kate Plummer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":365120582,"title":"'This Is Republicans' Shutdown': Former US VP Kamala Harris","text":"Washington, DC: Democratic political figures began weighing in on the government shutdown early on Wednesday, largely placing blame on US President Donald Trump and Republicans for the federal government shutdown.

But his message was also directed at Russian President Vladimir Putin, Iran, North Korea, Hamas, Venezuela, China, and anyone else testing his resolve.\n\n“I have your backs 100%,” Trump said to the military brass assembled for the unprecedented forum in Quantico, Va.\n\nThe gloom and doom predictions of the left with their shorts in a bunch about the gathering were dispelled immediately when the Pentagon broadcast first Hegseth, then the president, addressing the generals and admirals. It’s proof that the left cannot come to grips with the fact that taxpayers are fed up with the bull.\n\nTrump stressed that “merit” is the metric that now counts in the military and should elsewhere. It’s the “opposite of political correctness.”\n\nWe need to “solve wars instead of having to fight wars,” he said.\n\nAgain, the exact opposite of what pundits were predicting. It’s a simple equation: Deterrence through strength.\n\nThe president announced $1 trillion would be spent on the military in 2026, and soldiers and sailors would receive a 3.8% raise. There was more: He’s investing in a “Golden Dome” to protect the U.S., building 19 more ships for the Navy and launching a “sixth-generation” fighter jet — the F47.\n\nThat should curl Kamala Harris’ hair.\n\nThe military, both men said, will have a focus on fitness and ability, and “defending the homeland” will be a priority.\n\nHis message about avoiding war should be hailed today: “Count on people like me to keep you out of wars,” Trump said, adding if the military is called upon, he won’t hesitate.\n\nHe praised the gathering as straight out of “central casting.” That’s not a commander-in-chief belittling his generals, as some predicted he would. It’s the exact opposite.\n\nTrump said he is laser-focused on “putting America first.”\n\nThat should be every government worker’s goal.\n\n“It’s amazing what strength can do,” he said late in his address, telling the brass the military is “the knife’s edge.”\n\nThe president added, “The purpose of America’s military is not to protect anyone’s feelings. It’s to protect our republic. … We will not be politically correct when it comes to defending American freedom. And we will be a fighting and winning machine.”\n\nBe prepared for the spin as Trump’s and Hegseth’s words are parsed. That’s to be expected.\n\nBut in our Nuclear Age, this is exactly what America needs today, with wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and tensions all over the world. NATO needs to step up, Canada, too. But the U.S. under President Trump will remain the guardian of the world.\n\nThe haters — and that includes the Associated Press and other outlets that refuse to listen to this administration before writing — need to tap the brakes. We are on the razor’s edge and leadership is needed at this juncture in our history.\n\nThat’s exactly what President Trump and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth delivered. It was televised for all to see. Your military will now be trained to fight.","summary":"“The purpose of America's military is not to protect anyone’s feelings. It’s to protect our republic. ...

Their selection bias is transparent.\n\nPolitiFact was live-blogging and throwing “Pants on Fire” rulings on their X account. For example, Trump claimed we were losing 300,000 Americans to fentanyl, which is exaggerated. Trump can’t say grocery prices are down. They’re up 2.7% in 2025.\n\nCNN’s Daniel Dale was on speed dial from Canada for a televised pounce. Like the other “independents,” Dale couldn’t stand Trump taking credit for ending a list of wars, and then comes the nitpicking that some of these were disputes, not hot wars, and temporary ceasefires could be temporary. CNN’s “Facts First” website is dedicated to attacking Trump.\n\nOne may certainly argue that an American president making a speech at the United Nations is a news event worth fact-checking. But it’s all in the targeting. Try to remember Dale or PolitiFact touching on President Joe Biden’s speech to the U.N. last year.\n\nKamala Harris is now going on a book tour. Does anyone think the “fact-checkers” will get involved? On “The Rachel Maddow Show,” Harris uncorked a whopper about Trump: “I called him at my speech on the Ellipse a tyrant. We used to compare the strength of our democracy to communist dictators. That’s what we’re dealing with right now in Donald Trump, and these titans of industry are not speaking up.”\n\nTrump is a communist dictator? That’s what’s implied. Last year, PolitiFact threw a “Pants on Fire” when Trump called Harris a communist. We can only guess that they won’t do the same in reverse. Democrats have routinely called Trump a “fascist” and compare him to Hitler and Mussolini, and PolitiFact and their ilk sit on their hands.\n\nThey don’t “fact-check” Maddow and the rest of the cable-news hotheads. Maddow said to Harris: “I feel like a lot of the defenses that we tried to build up in advance of this type of a sort of would-be authoritarian takeover were about warning people about how serious the threat was.”\n\nYou can say “authoritarian playbook” every 30 seconds and know the “fact-checkers” will not point out that Trump and the Republicans were democratically elected.\n\nHarris then boosted Jimmy Kimmel: “As it relates to the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel. We saw the power of the people over the last few days, and it spoke volumes, and it moved a decision in the right direction.”\n\nKimmel can lie his face off about Charlie Kirk’s assassin being a Trump supporter, and the “fact-checkers” didn’t ding the “comedian.” His heart’s moving in the “right direction,” so facts, schmacts.\n\nJimmy Kimmel only has two PolitiFact checks over the 18 years of their existence. “Comedians” get a break when they lie. Trump has 213 “Pants on Fire” punishments. Trump’s attacks on liberals are very likely to be tagged as falsehoods, but almost everything is considered “fair game” when you attack Trump.\n\nTim Graham is director of media analysis at the Media Research Center and executive editor of the blog NewsBusters.org.","summary":"You can say \"authoritarian playbook\" every 30 seconds and know the \"fact-checkers\" will not point out that Trump and the Republicans were democratically elected.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/10/01/graham-fact-checkers-play-political-favorites/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BHR-Z-GRAHAM-01_f90772.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 07:06:06","author":"Tim Graham","authors":["Tim Graham"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.431},{"id":365103984,"title":"Why mass shootings spur finger-pointing by politicians as they’ve become heartbreakingly common","text":"It seems like there’s a mass shooting every other day, to the point where some aren’t covered and others get a day or two of media attention before they’re eclipsed by other news. What’s also striking is that the deranged loners who had no ties to outside groups, whose families say they had no interest in politics, suddenly decide to pursue their grievances and open fire, even at schools. They have access to guns and turn into monsters, often getting themselves killed, or killing themselves, in the process. MICHIGAN CHURCH SHOOTER'S ROMANCE HISTORY EMERGES AS SUSPECT'S FATHER APOLOGIZES TO VICTIMS' FAMILIES This applies to the Mormon Church shooter and arsonist in Michigan, who never got over a breakup with a devout Mormon a decade ago, felt pressure to join the church and started calling it the Antichrist. Some shooters have served in the military. And that, with stunning speed, brings us to the blame game. Both the Trump Republicans and the Democrats rush to attack the other side, even before we know much about the shooter, who by any reasonable definition is clinically insane. Jon Stewart had a rant the other night which I mostly agree with: \"There’s a mass shooting now like every couple of hours. Previously, the routine would be we express our shock; we express our sadness; we offer our thoughts and prayers; we spend a day, maybe two, arguing about the appropriateness of bringing up guns at all; and then we do nothing until the next time. But as our politics becomes more polarized, even that learned cycle of helplessness has been replaced by a new, post-shooting pastime. That new pastime is, ‘Was this one of yours?'\" After playing clips of conservative and liberal shows, Stewart said: \"The game is so ubiquitous, now we often play it before we even know who the perpetrator is … Now call me old-fashioned, but I miss the good old days of mass shootings when networks took a principled stance to not shower attention on acts designed to get attention.\" SECOND DETAINEE DIES AFTER DALLAS ICE FACILITY SNIPER ATTACK, FAMILY SPEAKS OUT The \"Daily Show\" host says the MSM are following the lead of social media, and the left got to celebrate when the late killer had a Trump/Vance sign in front of his house. \"Who the f*** cares? These mass shootings do not fit neatly into our left-right paradigm.\" Now I agree that the media are narcissistic, but that’s not what’s at play here. And the reason I never talk or write about these lunatics by name is to avoid giving them the notoriety they crave. We’ve forgotten the names of most of the shooters — even that of the second would — be assassin who was ready to fire at President Trump last year — and they should all be anonymously condemned to the dustbin of history. But there is a left-right paradigm that, honestly, is the foundation of much of the media, especially cable news. It’s what we know. It’s what we do. FROM AOC TO ZOHRAN MAMDANI, THE DEMOCRATS ARE PEDDLING FAR-LEFT POLITICS Most of the recent political violence is coming from the left, no question about it. Yet liberals seem unsure what to do about it, with rote statements that try to deflect liability. They’re almost defending the worst of the worst. That’s why they were buoyant over the Michigan shooter who rooted for Trump and Vance – to remind people that there are also political shootings from the right wing. Now it’s conservatives playing defense – as if shooting and setting fire to a Mormon church service wasn’t horrifying enough, killing at least four people and wounding eight. \"Why are we taking the bait from these psychos?\" Stewart asks. But the montage of clips he played don’t feature pundits; they show lawmakers and other leaders being interviewed. Which is part of what the media do to cover an ongoing story, at least as long as it stays in the news. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We keep falling into the trap. Finger-pointing often crowds out reporting of each tragedy. Maybe we’ve all become inured to it now that mass shootings are so tragically commonplace. Footnote: While the Washington punditocracy has been trashing Kamala Harris’ book tour as hurting Democrats and reminding them of Joe Biden’s decline, sales of the book are another story. Simon & Schuster says she has sold 350,000 copies so far, and has ordered a fifth printing to bring the total to 500,000. The publisher predicts it will be the best-selling memoir of 2025. So despite the slings and arrows, she’s laughing all the way to the bank.","summary":"Mass shootings now spark instant political blame between Republicans and Democrats, overshadowing victims as tragedies become heartbreakingly routine.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/why-mass-shootings-spur-finger-pointing-republican-democrat-politicians-theyve-become-heartbreakingly-common","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/09/dallas-ice-facility-shooting-law-enforcement.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6380355108112","publish_date":"2025-10-01 07:00:35","author":"Howard Kurtz","authors":["Howard Kurtz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.334},{"id":365074010,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert appear on each other's shows: The 5 best moments","text":"The late night circuit got its version of a unique crossover event Tuesday night as Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert appeared as guests on each other's shows. It was a fitting stunt considering both talk show hosts have been at the center of noteworthy professional situations shrouded in political and national significance, and both orbit in the same universe of President Trump's contempt. The two hosts, who have vocally supported each other through the respective ordeals on their shows, were now able to continue the mutual backing in full force, face-to-face. In the wake of the fallout of Kimmel's suspension earlier this month over comments he made related to the death of conservative pundit Charlie Kirk, the recently reinstated host charged ahead with moving his L.A.-based show to Brooklyn for a week as planned, with Colbert among the star-studded list of guests. Colbert was effusive in his support of Kimmel after ABC pre-empted his talk show, criticizing the decision as \"blatant censorship.\" Kimmel, meanwhile, appeared on \"The Late Show,\" alongside pop star Sam Smith. Earlier this year, CBS announced it was canceling \"The Late Show\" and would end after the season wraps in May 2026 — marking not only the end of Colbert's run at the helm, but also bringing the late night institution to a close after a 30-year run. The decision, the company said, was due to financial reasons and not — as many have speculated — because of Colbert's criticism of a deal between the Trump administration and Paramount, the parent company of CBS, the network that airs \"The Late Show,\" over.a 2024 \"60 Minutes\" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Kimmel was one of the many who expressed disdain over the decision, even campaigning for Colbert to win an Emmy though Kimmel was on the same ballot. (Colbert ultimately won.) Ahead of Kimmel’s appearance on “The Late Show,” Colbert hosted another late-night host, Conan O’Brien, who appeared as a guest Monday, opening the conversation with, “Stephen, how’s late night? What’s going on? I’ve been out of it for a little bit — catch me up on what’s happening.” “I’ll send you the obituary,” Colbert replied. Here are five standout moments from the night of shared grievances. In his first sit-down interview since the \"The Late Show\" was canceled, Colbert walked Kimmel through the timeline of his show's cancellation. He said he received the news from their mutual manager, James Dixon, after the taping of his show on July 16. He got home to his wife, Evie McGee-Colbert, two and a half hours later. As he walked into the apartment, according to Colbert, his wife said, \"What happened? You get canceled?\" Dixon knew for a week but had been hesitant to relay the news to Colbert, who was on vacation. Once he learned the show's fate, Colbert said he was unsure about when he should break the news to his staff, debating whether to wait until after the summer break or in September. His wife, though, said he would tell them the following day. \"We get into the building,\" he said, \"I go up the elevator, I walk through the offices. By time I get to my offices, I have sweat through my shirt because I didn't want to know anything my staff didn't know. And I said, 'I'm going to tell my staff today,' but then we couldn't do a show if I told them because everybody would be bummed out and I would be bummed out.\" He only told executive producer Tom Purcell at first. He got through the whole show. And then he asked the audience and staff to stick around for one more act so he could record the announcement. \"My stage manager goes, 'Oh no, we're done, Steve, we're done.' And I said, 'nope, there's one more act of the show. Please don't let the audience leave.' And he goes, 'No, boss, no. Boss. I got that. I got the thing here. We've done everything.' And I said, 'I'm aware of that. And I'm here to tell you there's one more act of the show,'\" he explained. \"So I went backstage, I said, 'Everybody, get on Zoom.' I told everybody as briefly as I could so they wouldn't find out about it on air. And then I went back out on stage to tell everybody. And I was so nervous about doing it right — because there was nothing in the prompter, I was just speaking off the cuff — that I f— up twice. And I had to restart and the audience thought it was a bit and they started going, 'Steve, you can do it.' Because I always messed up on the sentence that told them what was happening. And then I got to the sentence that actually told them was happening, and they didn't laugh.\" Kimmel, in turn, shared that he found out about \"The Late Show's\" cancellation while attending a No Kings protest march. Like Colbert, Tuesday marked the first time Kimmel had been interviewed since his suspension earlier this month, and he detailed the day he got the news he was being pulled from the air. Kimmel's office is busy — there's roughly five other people working in there with him at all times, he told Colbert. So when ABC executives wanted to speak with him less than two hours before he was set to tape that night's episode, Kimmel resorted to the bathroom to take the call in private. \"I'm on the phone with the ABC executives, and they say, 'Listen, we want to take the temperature down. We're concerned about what you're gonna say tonight, and we decided that the best route is to take the show off the air,'\" Kimmel said before the audience interjected with boos. \"There was a vote, and I lost the vote, and so I put my pants back on and I walked out to my office,\" before telling some of his producing team the news, he said. \"My wife said I was whiter than Jim Gaffigan when I came out.\" The decision on Kimmel's suspension came so late in the day that the audience was already in their seats and had to be sent home, Kimmel told Colbert. While touting the crossover event in his monologue (“We thought it might be a fun way to drive the President nuts so…”), Kimmel took time to stress the groundswell of support Colbert has both in New York, where he does his show, and in Kimmel’s homebase of L.A. To prove it, the camera cut to a photo showing signs that were displayed over the 101 freeway in L.A. when Kimmel went back on the air following his suspension. They read: “Public pressure works — Kimmel is back!” “And this is the sign that is up now,” Kimmel continued, cutting to video of more recent signage over the freeway. “It says, “Now do Colbert.” The California governor — who also moonlights (by proxy of his social media team) as the unofficial No. 1 Trump troll — made the cross-country trip to Brooklyn to surprise Kimmel on stage. Or did he? As the host mentioned the politician’s latest jab at Trump during his monologue, Newsom barreled onto the stage on a bike before finding his place next to Kimmel for a roughly six-minute spiel, delivered in his best California bro speak, on his mission to bring people together. \"L.A and N.Y.C., we're not so different,\" Newsom said. \"I mean, we both just want to be free to smoke weed while riding our electric scooters to a drag queen brunch.\" As Kimmel pressed how exactly they can succeed in coming together, a blustering Newsom responded: “We already started, dog. These people get it. They have their own great late night hosts here in NYC, but tonight they chose my homie from L.A. They could be partying with my dude, J-Fall and The Roots crew — they're a rap band … because you did look confused. Anyway, these Brooklyn-istas came to see you instead of checking out the political commentary of John Oliver or J-Stew or pay their respects to Colbert before he shipped off to Guantanamo Gay, or they could have gone and watched whatever that little creep Seth Meyers is doing … dude dresses like a substitute Montessori teacher. I mean, do you know why he sits down for his jokes? Same reason yo’ mama sits down to pee.\" Cue a special appearance from Seth Meyers, Kimmel’s friend and fellow late night host to rein in … his brother? For the non-late night connoisseurs reading this: Meyers’ brother, Josh, played the \"Covid bro\" version of Newsom during the pandemic in sketches that aired on NBC's “Late Night with Seth Meyers.” Newsom took the gag further on Tuesday, impersonating Josh impersonating himself on Kimmel’s stage. “We're bros, but no, we're not,” Newsom as Josh said. “Look, I get this all the time, probably because we're both so hot.” Meanwhile, keeping the planned awkwardness going, Kimmel took the opportunity to mention to Meyers that he was in town if he wanted to get dinner. Meyers responded: “What happened with your show? I thought this whole thing was, you know … “ “We're back on the air,” Kimmel said. “We're back on now.” It should also be noted that Kimmel, Colbert and Meyers later posed for a photo onstage and uploaded it to their respective social media accounts with the caption, “Hi Donald!” Looking ahead at the remaining months Colbert will be on the air, Kimmel asked the host when he was going to \"go nuts,\" and suggested he lose his glasses and \"maybe do some ayahuasca on set.\" Kimmel then gifted him a bong with a Statue of Liberty design, which he called a \"chemistry set.\" Colbert started playing along by unbuttoning his blazer and saying \"f— that\" to a signal that he only had a minute left in the segment. (\"What are they gonna do, cancel me?\" Colbert asked). Then, as if right on cue, Guillermo Rodriguez, Kimmel's friend and sidekick on his show, came onto the stage with tequila (and three shot glasses) in hand. On the first round of Don Julio, Colbert made a toast: \"To good friends, great jobs and late-night TV.\" Colbert then poured another round and Kimmel pulled out the bong he had gifted the host. The group then took one more shot together and Kimmel toasted to Colbert. Guillermo, who got a round of hearty cheers from the crowd, is known for giving out shots and toasting with A-Listers at awards shows and other Hollywood events.","summary":"Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert were guests on each other's shows Tuesday.

Discussing how Miller was recently called a “fascist” online, the White House deputy chief said the party has become one that “openly aids and encourages and foments violence.” (RELATED: Democrat Senator Says His Party Should Not Tone Down Rhetoric Against ICE Agents After Shooting)\n\n“We all lived through the unspeakable tragedy of two nearly successful assassination attempts on President Trump. A bullet came within a centimeter of taking his life. We watched in agony and horror as a crazed left-wing terrorist murdered Charlie Kirk just while he’s giving a speech having a debate on a college campus. We watched the UnitedHealthcare CEO get gunned down in cold blood. We saw just days ago a sniper try to take out ICE officers,” Miller said. “What do all of these killers and assassins have in common?”\n\n“They’ve been radicalized by Democrat Party rhetoric that describes anyone who doesn’t share their warped, twisted worldview as fascist, worthy, by implication of execution. They are using this language to mark people, to put a target on them,” Miller added. “Then on top of all of that, what else do they do? When Antifa, when these left-wing terrorists attack our law enforcement, Democrat judges won’t put them in jail. Democrat-led police departments refuse to arrest them. Democrat mayors and governors refuse to pursue them. So when violence is openly occurring against the targets that they have named and identified, they will not arrest the violent agitators.”\n\nOn Friday, Democrat California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s press office posted, “STEPHEN MILLER IS A FASCIST!” just weeks after Republicans called out the labels Democrats have attached to them. Republicans quickly accused the office of inciting violence.\n\nFollowing Kirk’s assassination, the president signed the NSPM on Thursday, which accuses the political violence seen in recent years of not being random attacks but instead ones of sophistication. Miller went on to say that with the executive order in place, the administration will begin its national counterterrorism strategy.\n\n“That’s when you change the formal national security policy of the country. So President Trump issued an NSPM last week that for the first time ever establishes a national counterterrorism strategy to dismantle these radical left-wing terror groups, including but not limited to Antifa,” Miller said.\n\n“President Trump’s going to find the members. He’s going to find the funders. He’s going to find the violent terrorists. He’s going to find everybody involved in these criminal conspiracies. And one by one, we’re going to dismantle them,” Miller said.\n\nSince last year, tensions between Republicans and Democrats have risen during the 2024 presidential election cycle, as corporate media and former Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign escalated their rhetoric against Trump. The then-GOP presidential candidate was called a fascist by Harris, with former President Joe Biden saying he should be locked up.\n\nLast week, a shooter opened fire on the Dallas facility where ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations conducts arrests and deportations, killing at least two detainees. FBI Director Kash Patel, on X, posted photos of shell casings from the attack, showing one engraved with the phrase “Anti-ICE.”\n\nThe shooting comes shortly after a 63-year-old Sacramento man was accused of shooting at ABC affiliate KXTV and allegedly writing both Patel, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and Attorney General Pam Bondi as “next.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

I thought the right wasn't into cancellations.\n\nDon't tell that to Trump-loving stalwart Benny Johnson. He's all fired up because Bad Bunny sings 'no songs in English.'\n\nI will tell you this, Benny: his voice is so sexy, I can't understand a word he's singing but I know exactly what he's saying.\n\nThere's one obvious reason Bad Bunny got the gig – he's supremely talented. A couple of my friends recently flew to Puerto Rico to catch one of his shows and said he was such a powerful showman that they were 'ugly crying.' (I haven't ugly cried at the Super Bowl since Chris Stapleton performed the national anthem in 2023 and he's a lib!)\n\nBunny boy also has a massive international fan base – and the NFL is desperate to spread the Gospel of the Pigskin to every corner of the globe. If you haven't noticed – they love money, too.\n\nLook, I get it, Bad Bunny has some bad takes. Mr Bunny (né Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio) has said some incendiary things – like refusing to play in the United States for fears that 'f*****g ICE could be outside' the venues. (Funny how that moralizing melted away when he was offered the biggest gig in music). \n\nI'm also aware that the past few Super Bowl halftime shows have been underwhelming, oddly sexual and just plain weird (yes, I'm talking to you Kendrick, Rihanna and Usher).\n\nBut I know a genuine star when I see one. \n\nI stumbled upon Bad Bunny getting out of an SUV at 30 Rock in New York before his appearance on Jimmy Fallon earlier this year. The guy was sweet and humble and embraced his fans with a rare earnestness. I remember, just from that brief moment, that he's a nice guy with a good heart.\n\nA little juice from this hunky island squeeze can only be a win, right?\n\nIf I refused to listen to any music written by someone who doesn't share my politics, I'd be running on the treadmill in silence.\n\nPrince arguably had the very best Super Bowl performance in history - tickling his guitar to a beautifully filthy rendition of 'Purple Rain' during an actual deluge. Do you think he was a big tariff guy? I'm guessing no.\n\nI'm also certain that I don't care what his or any singer's politics are as long as they can deliver a performance that cuts through the processed meat chunks in my 7-layer baloney casserole and slices right into my soul.\n\nTo the loud and proud MAGA faithful, vigilantly standing guard to fight every cultural battle, I kindly ask: Can't you fellas just sit this one out for once?\n\nWhat could be more unifying that watching White House Border Czar Tom Homan sucking down Pabst Blue Ribbons and dancing the salsa with his wife to 'Tití Me Preguntó.'\n\nThere are battles to be fought against formative foes who truly wish us ill, but this ginned-up pitchforking of Bad Bunny is not one of those skirmishes.\n\nGive the guy the benefit of the doubt and let him sing and dance and take off his pants, but keep your shirts on! And who knows, if Bad Bunny sucks eggs maybe next year Roger Goodell will change course and have Morgan Wallen and Kid Rock co-headline. And we'll all watch the liberal freak-out together – and laugh.\n\nSelena Gomez and Hairy Bob Dylan got married this weekend in front of a slew of celebs from Ed Sheeran to Taylor Swift, but the hirsute groom couldn't even bring himself to shave for the big day.\n\nIt got me thinking... when you start out as the Wolfman on your honeymoon, what do you turn into during a full moon – Vin Diesel?\n\nEveryone hates Kamala!\n\nKamala Harris's admission in her book that she didn't pick Mayor Pete Buttigieg to be her veep because he was gay sent Jon Stewart into apoplexy.\n\n'Oh my God, it's actually reverse affirmative action,' Stewart vented on his Weekly Show podcast.\n\nHe's right. If only Joe Biden had done the same in 2020, his discriminating taste would've saved us all a lot of grief.\n\nJenny from the Block is opening up about her divorce from miserable shlub Ben Affleck, telling CBS News Sunday Morning the humiliating split was 'the best thing that ever happened to me.'\n\nDivorce isn't usually one of life's romps, but since this is Lola's fourth marital fissure maybe she has finally realized that matrimony doesn't agree with her.\n\nDaisy duke-less\n\nWe haven't seen the likes of Disappearing Jessica Simpson since 90s heroin chic. Except this time around, gals are using a different kind of needle.\n\nNow, 45-year-old Jessica's deflated dukes are pimping a new lingerie line for Walmart that she's calling 'one of my best kept secrets.'\n\nHoney, that's not your only secret.\n\nSpeaking of stick thin, Ariana Grande has been pointing a bony finger at Trump supporters.\n\n'I have one very genuine question… has your life gotten better?' she posted on Instagram. 'Have your groceries gotten cheaper? Has your health insurance premium gone down? Has your work/life balance improved? Has you taken a vacation yet? Are you happier?'\n\nUm, bro… that's six questions.\n\nEat a sandwich and stay in your lane.\n\nWhat a witch\n\nHave you watched the Harry Potter movie where Hermione is reduced to a steaming pile of goo?\n\nOh, wait!

His latest album, “Debí Tirar Más Fotos,” became the first of 2025 to surpass 7 billion Spotify streams on Sunday.\n\nIn 2020, he was among the guest performers for the Super Bowl LIV halftime show, co-headlined by Latina superstars Shakira and Jennifer Lopez.\n\nHe is known for proudly representing his home island of Puerto Rico in his music and on his social media platforms, where he shares the US territory’s culture and the challenges that it faces. (Puerto Ricans are US citizens.)\n\n“What I’m feeling goes beyond myself,” Bad Bunny said in a statement announcing his selection. “It’s for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown … this is for my people, my culture, and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”\n\nBad Bunny recently wrapped up a sold-out 31-show concert residency in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which drew hundreds of thousands of fans and is estimated to have generated more than $700 million for the island. Later this year, he will embark on a worldwide stadium tour that will include stops in Mexico, Japan, Australia and France.\n\nThe US mainland was noticeably missing from his list of tour venues.\n\nHe said in a recent interview with i-D magazine that he was worried that US mainland shows would have exposed his Latino fan base to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.\n\n“ICE could be outside. And it’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about,” he said in the interview.\n\nHe was already on shaky ground with Mr Trump’s supporters.\n\nIn 2024, Bad Bunny offered his support for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, sharing a video of her plans for Puerto Rico on his Instagram - just moments after a speaker at Trump’s rally in New York City referred to the US territory as a “floating island of garbage.”\n\nBad Bunny has been vocally critical of Mr Trump. In 2017, he arrived at the Somos Live benefit concert, which was held to raise money for disaster relief, weeks after Hurricane Maria, wearing T-shirt that read: “¿Tu eres twitero o presidente?” (“Are you a tweeter or president?”) And he explicitly criticised Mr Trump with vulgarities in a 2020 song.\n\nIn July, he took aim at Mr Trump’s immigration policies in the music video for his song “NUEVAYol,” featuring a voice that sounds like Trump’s apologising to immigrants.\n\n“I made a mistake,” the voice says. “… I want to say that this country is nothing without the immigrants. This country is nothing without Mexicans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Colombians, Venezuelans, Cubans.”\n\nWhat are MAGA commentators saying?\n\nThe Super Bowl announcement triggered swift criticism from MAGA influencers, including several from the sports world.\n\n“No songs in English should not be allowed at one of America’s highest rated television events of the year,” Danica Patrick, a former professional racing driver and rising conservative pundit, wrote on X.\n\n“Do a little homework and it’s obvious that Bad Bunny is so much worse than most realise. Can you say, DEMONIC??” wrote Sage Steele, a former ESPN anchor and conservative speaker.\n\nTomi Lahren, a conservative commentator, reposted an AI-generated video of Bad Bunny saying he was never performing in the United States again because of ICE concerns and suggested sending Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, to the Super Bowl.\n\nJack Posobiec, another right-wing commentator, suggested that Turning Point USA host a “counter-Superbowl halftime show” with rock band Creed. He blamed “Barack Obama’s best friend” Jay-Z for the selection of Bad Bunny as the headliner. Jay-Z’s company Roc Nation has a partnership with the NFL to produce the halftime show.\n\n“The NFL is self-destructing year after year,” Benny Johnson, a prominent podcaster, wrote on X.\n\nSome prominent Democrats responded to Johnson’s post. “Another MAGA Karen trying to censor popular artists,” wrote Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Arizona).\n\nWhat has Trump said about Bad Bunny?\n\nMr Trump has not commented on Bad Bunny’s selection as the Super Bowl headliner, but that could change any minute.\n\nMr Trump has long had a tumultuous relationship with the NFL, predating his first term as president. As a businessman, Mr Trump tried unsuccessfully on several occasions to become an owner of an NFL team.\n\nDuring his first term as president, Mr Trump demanded that NFL owners fire or suspend players who kneel during the national anthem in protest and urged fans to boycott.\n\nThe league, which has long marketed itself as a bastion of patriotism, eventually created policies to keep protesting players in the locker room during the anthem.\n\nMr Trump’s relationship with the NFL has seemingly improved. Earlier this year, he became the first sitting US President to attend the Super Bowl. In May, Mr Trump announced that the 2027 NFL Draft will take place on the National Mall in Washington.\n\n© 2025 , The Washington Post","summary":"‘Make America Great Again’ supporters have zeroed in on Bad Bunny’s music, fashion and recent comments, criticising the artist ahead of his Super Bowl performance.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/lifestyle/culture/bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-show-singers-selection-as-headliner-sparks-maga-fury-c-20198747","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-20198747/fdbaef661570d541c66cb363500bd496b26a1033-16x9-x1y0w2446h1376.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 03:14:10","author":"Sabrina Rodriguez,Sabrina Rodriguezth","authors":["Sabrina Rodriguez","Sabrina Rodriguezth"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.42},{"id":365028556,"title":"Trump pulls his nominee to lead Bureau of Labor Statistics after accusations of offensive social media posts: report","text":"President Donald Trump has withdrawn his nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, EJ Antoni, weeks after reports accused him of writing since-deleted inflammatory tweets.\n\nA White House official confirmed to the Associated Press that his nomination was being pulled, but didn’t elaborate on the reasons behind the move. \n\nAntoni was a “brilliant economist,” a White House official told The New York Times, adding that Trump would announce a new pick soon.\n\nThe Senate received paperwork formally withdrawing Antoni’s nomination on Tuesday, the AP reported.\n\nThe Independent has asked the White House for more information.\n\nTrump tapped Antoni, the chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, for the post in August after ousting the agency’s last commissioner Erika McEntarfer.

Kamala's Book Is a Hit! California's Doom Loop\n\n | \n\nPosted By RCP RadioOn Date September 30, 2025\n\nTuesday on the RealClearPolitics radio show, Tom Bevan, Carl Cannon, and Andrew Walworth discussed the speech to military officers today by Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, and the politics of a government shutdown as another funding deadline expires. They also examine the surprisingly good sales numbers for Kamala Harris' new book, and the consequences of a federal judge blocking the Trump administration from firing more than 500 employees of the U.S. Agency for Global Media\n\nLater, RCP contributor Maggie Miller talks with Ana Kasparian about her new piece for RealClearInvestigations on the state of the California economy: \"All That Glitters: How Taxes and Regulation Are Tarnishing the Golden State\"\n\nYou can listen to the show weeknights at 6:00 p.m. on SiriusXM's POTUS Channel 124 and then on Apple, Spotify, YouTube, and here on our website.\n\nThe show opened with Secretary of War Pete Hegseth's speech this morning to generals and officers declaring the end of the \"woke military\" and a return to the performance standards of the 1990s -- applied equally to men and women. \n\n\"I thought Hegseth was superb today,\" Bevan said. \"He was calm, cool, concise, in total command. And on substance, it was appropriate. This is what the American public voted for.\"\n\nCannon agreed: \"This idea that he's 'fat shaming' these out-of-shape generals and officers waddling around the Pentagon has a certain appeal, I guess.\" \n\nAfter that, starting at minute 16, the federal government is set to enter \"shut down\" mode at midnight because Democrats and Republicans in Congress failed to reach a budget agreement in time. The difference this time is that President Trump has directed the OMB to take advantage of the shutdown to permanently cut as much as he possibly can. How could this play out?\n\n\"It\u0019s not novel that each side thinks the politics are on their side\u0014Republicans and Democrats talk themselves into it,\" Cannon said. \"Now you have a different dynamic: the executive branch isn\u0019t closing agencies; the government\u0019s been closed. and it's the Democrats who did it.\"\n\n\"I don\u0019t know if Trump can pull it off\u0014he tends to blurt out the stage directions\u0014but they can make cuts and then say these jobs weren\u0019t needed, and we saw that during the shutdown that you orchestrated,\" Cannon continued. \"Politically and in policy terms, that\u0019s tough for Democrats, and I think courts are more likely to uphold these kinds of firings than the ones heretofore.\"\n\nAnd then, around minute 26, the gang wonders how the new campaign book, \"107 Days,\" by Kamala Harris, has sold 350,000 copies in just a couple of weeks, despite mixed reviews. Is it a great book? \n\n\"It\u0019s a publishing phenomenon! You never can tell\u0014it's alchemy. God bless Kamala Harris for an unlikely hit,\" Cannon said. \"But I guess this means she\u0019s going to run for president again. If someone is out there buying in bulk, they may get more than they bargained for\u0014she\u0019ll take it as a mandate.\"\n\n\"To be clear, we have no evidence someone is buying in bulk\u0014\" Walworth added. \"Politico says her memoir is on track to match Britney Spears, Taylor Swift, Prince Harry\u0014 that's big numbers.\"\n\nTom Bevan says either way, this makes it much more likely she's running in 2028: \"If you\u0019re Kamala Harris and you see this, it cements in your mind that you have that star quality.\"\n\nNext, starting at minute 30, a federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from firing more than 500 employees of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees things like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe. Are they back in business right in time for the government shutdown? \n\n\"Their plan wasn\u0019t to eliminate it entirely\u0014keep about six employees to keep the shortwaves going. The judge didn\u0019t like that,\" Walworth explained. \"But if the Defense Department becomes the Department of War\u0014no nation-building\u0014then you need Voice of America more than ever.\"\n\nFinally, at minute 29, RCP contributor Maggie Miller talks with Ana Kasparian about her new piece for RealClearInvestigations on the state of the California economy: \"All That Glitters: How Taxes and Regulation Are Tarnishing the Golden State\"\n\nShe discusses how rising crime, high taxes, strict regulations, and one of the nation\u0019s highest minimum wages are driving businesses out and leaving workers with fewer opportunities.

These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”\n\nCarr said that his “easy way, or the hard way” comment was referring to news distortion complaints and that “there’s an easy way that these can be dealt with — either the TV stations and the national programmers can work it out … privately. Or there’s another qay, which is people can file news distortion complaints at the FCC, and that’s what happened, in which case we have to run an FCC process on that.”\n\nBut in other comments in the Benny Johnson interview, Carr did bring up the prospect of Kimmel being fired and the possible revocation of station licenses.\n\nHe said: “Look, there’s calls for Kimmel to be fired. You could certainly see a path forward for suspension over this. Again, the FCC is going to have remedies that we can look at. We may ultimately be called to be a judge on that.”\n\nHe also said that “it’s time that a lot of these licensed broadcasters themselves push back on Comcast and Disney and say, “Listen, we’re going to preempt, we’re not going to run Kimmel anymore, and so you straighten this out because we, licensed broadcasters are running into the possibility of fines or license revocation from the FCC if we continue to run content that ends up being a pattern of news distortion.”\n\nHours after the podcast interview, Nexstar, the largest station group, announced that it was pulling Kimmel’s show for the foreseeable future. Soon after, ABC announced that it was dropping the program indefinitely. Another station group, Sinclair, also announced that it would not air Kimmel’s show.\n\nBut following a backlash, Disney-owned ABC reversed course, and reinstated Kimmel the following week. Several days later, Sinclair and Nexstar said that they would restore the show to their stations, while claiming that the decision to pull the show was not due to government pressure.\n\nNevertheless, Carr’s comments were seen as a threat by GOP figures including Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). Cruz compared Carr’s remark to a mafia boss, warning that it was “dangerous” in that Democrats may deploy similar tactics when they return to power.\n\nAsked wether Cruz also was taking his comments out of context, Carr said, “I have no comment on that. Obviously you’re free to ask them about their views. What I’ve been clear about is that if you look ar the full context, not only what I said, but what the companies themselves have said about their decision. It was a business decision.”\n\nNexstar is seeking FCC approval of its merger with Tegna, and also has been one of the leading corporate advocates urging the agency to lift a national media ownership cap. Sinclair also wants the FCC to relax that rule.\n\nThe FCC meeting drew about a dozen demonstrators, several of whom interrupted the proceedings by shouting “Fire Carr the censorship czar!” They were escorted out by security. Members of the group also wore T-shirts with the FCC logo but the words “Federal Censorship Commission.” Outside, a truck sponsored by the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders with the message, “The FCC’s policing of content is abuse of power.”\n\nCarr, though, signaled that he would continue to scrutinize individual shows, including ABC’s The View, whose co-hosts have been at times scathing in their criticism of Donald Trump.\n\nCarr has raised the prospect of reviewing whether the show still fell under the bona fide news exemption of the FCC’s equal opportunity rule. That requires that shows that feature political candidates provide rivals equal time upon request. Talk shows have traditionally fallen under the same exemption given to news and documentary programming.\n\n“We should be refreshing and reinvigorating our approach across the board,” Carr said. “So there may come a time where it’s appropriate for the FCC to take a look at the bona fide news exemption, perhaps sunset any guidance that has been out there, for any program right, left, center. It doesn’t matter to me.”\n\nAnna Gomez, the sole Democrat on the commission, said that what Carr has been doing is making threats over content, even though he lacks authority to do so.\n\n“The threats are the point,” she said. “This administration wants capitulation before it gets to the courts, because they want the companies to alter their behavior now, and they don’t want to risk having it go to court.”\n\nShe noted that among the complaints that the FCC has yet to act upon is one brought by a conservative group over the way that 60 Minutes edited an interview with Kamala Harris. The complaint alleged a violation of the FCC’s news distortion policy. But companies can only be found liable only if it can be proven “that they have deliberately distorted a factual news report.” That’s a high standard, Gomez said.\n\nCBS has challenged the complaint, but it also settled Trump’s lawsuit over the 60 Minutes interview for $16 million. Trump’s lawsuit was seen as a hurdle to overcome as Skydance sought government approval to merge with CBS’ parent, Paramount Global.\n\nCompanies, Gomez said, “are fraying our First Amendment and our democracy every time they capitulate, but I understand. They are businesses. They have obligations to their shareholders. So it’s also our obligation not to threaten and not to have these complaints hanging over people’s heads, and not to continue to threaten people with news distortion findings.”\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.

For instance, photos emerged of him outside the Capitol during the Jan. 6 protest and the White House later called him a “bystander” in the matter. Also, CNN alleged that Antoni ran a now-deleted Twitter account featuring offensive content.\n\nPrior to being nominated to lead the BLS, Antoni was chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation’s Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget. In a statement on Tuesday night, Kevin Roberts, president of The Heritage Foundation said that Antoni “continues to be one of the sharpest economic minds in the country.”\n\n“It is undeniable that BLS needs reform and E.J. was the right man for the job,” Roberts said.“E.J. will keep calling for that reform and serving the interests of the American people from his invaluable role as chief economist at Heritage.”\n\nAntoni also said he supports suspending the closely watched monthly job reports from the BLS because of inaccuracies. Those economic reports led to McEntarfer being abruptly fired in August by Trump right after new employment numbers produced by the agency showed major downward revisions from previous months.\n\nMcEntarfer had been head of the BLS since 2024. That report revealed that some 258,000 fewer jobs were added in May and June than previously reported.\n\nTrump had accused the BLS of “rigging” the employment numbers, a claim that drew condemnation from many in the economics space. He alleged the BLS under McEntarfer revised the numbers before the election to favor Democrats and presumably then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nRISING BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT RINGS ALARM BELLS FOR LABOR MARKET\n\n“That’s why, in both cases, there was massive, record setting revisions, in favor of the Radical Left Democrats,” Trump wrote on social media.\n\nBut the accusation was confounding, because the revisions would have been expected to hurt Harris and Democrats rather than help, because they showed that the labor market was worse than expected under the Biden-Harris administration just days before voters headed to the polls.","summary":"President Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics has had his nomination pulled amid speculation that he wouldn’t get enough confirmation votes in the Senate.

These events feel so far away now, when we read them from within the frequent shocks of the Trump presidency, from troops on the streets of Washington to the indictment of former FBI director James Comey. But the chapter titles – beginning “July 21. 107 Days to the Election” – remind us the election was just last year. \n\n“It says a lot about how traumatised we both were by what happened that night that Doug and I never discussed it with each other until I sat down to write this book,” Harris reflects about election night: her campaign at an end and Trump triumphant.\n\nThe book is not the whole story – not by a long shot. But her words about these events resonate with a ring of truth.\n\nBook review: 107 Days – Kamala Harris (Simon & Schuster)\n\nThe first chapter, Sunday July 21, covers the day Joe Biden – who disintegrated before our eyes in his catastrophic debate with Trump – withdrew from the race, with no road to victory. \n\nHe did want to endorse Harris, but “not for a day, maybe two”. She told him that would be “ruinous”. She argued that she was not just “the candidate in the strongest position to win”, but “the only person” who would preserve Biden’s legacy. “At this point, anyone else was bound to throw him – and all the good he had achieved – under the bus.”\n\nShe draws on her call notes to supply the reactions of various senior Democrats to the news that day, from Bill Clinton (“Oh my god, I’m so relieved!”) to Gavin Newsom:\n\nHiking. Will call back. (He never did.)\n\nThroughout, Harris is relentlessly sharp in recollecting the campaign – and very candid on all the principals, including the love of her husband, Doug Emhoff. \n\nIt takes courage to write about such an agonising, devastating defeat – after an historic, exhilarating campaign – so quickly and so personally. Memoirs are rarely written this quickly. (We are still waiting, five years later, for the second volume of Barack Obama’s memoirs.)\n\nIn writing this book, she got by with a little help from a “special friend”: Pulitzer prize winning Australian author Geraldine Brooks. Harris’ acknowledgements note her deep appreciation of working with Brooks, whose “ferocious and brilliant artistic insights were indispensable.” \n\nThe book fully reflects that. And who knows? Brooks one day might collaborate with Kamala on an inaugural address.\n\nCandid, but loyal about Biden\n\nHarris is candid about Biden’s decline, but still essentially loyal. \n\n“On his worst day, he was more deeply knowledgeable, more capable of exercising judgment, and far more compassionate than Donald Trump at his best,” she writes. “There was a distinction between his ability to campaign and his ability to govern.”\n\nBob Woodward, the dean of presidential journalists, reached the same conclusion in his last book, War.\n\nHarris writes:\n\nof all the people in the White House, I was in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out. I knew it would come off to him as incredibly self-serving if I advised him not to run. He would see it as naked ambition.\n\nThe choice, she says, should not “have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.”\n\nIn other words, this was a decision his family and associates did not want to make. But it was imperative the national interest be placed above Biden’s personal interest.\n\nThe Harris campaign kept the core of Team Biden. “I didn’t have time to build a new plane; I had to fly the aircraft available.”\n\nOne of Biden’s closest advisors, Mike Donilon (criticised in Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s recent Biden book, Original Sin) left Harris’ campaign two weeks in. \n\nShe describes him, during Biden’s 2024 campaign, filtering poll data and presenting “the numbers in soothing terms […] really there was nothing to see here”. At these briefings (which “made no sense to me”), she writes, “Doug had wanted to stop sitting next to me because he got tired of me kicking him under the table when I asked a question and got a nonanswer.”\n\nPete Buttigieg ‘too big of a risk’ as VP\n\nHarris delivers the goods on her vice-presidential search. She admits Pete Buttigieg (a personal friend) was her first choice and the “ideal partner” – but the then transportation secretary, with his husband and children, was “too big of a risk” for “a Black woman married to a Jewish man”.\n\nJosh Shapiro, governor of Pennsylvania, came across to her as wanting a co-presidency. “At one point, he mused that he would want to be in the room for every decision […] I had a nagging concern that he would be unable to settle for a role as number two.”\n\nShe viewed senator and retired astronaut Mark Kelly of Arizona very favourably, but was afraid the Trump attack machine would try to take him down on his (excellent) military service record – just like the Republicans did to John Kerry in 2004. The man who led that effort, Chris LaCivita, was now a top Trump campaign aide.\n\nCould a captain, used to deference and respect, adapt to an opponent’s national campaign specifically designed to disrespect him, to cut a hero down to something small?\n\nOf course, the military service slander she feared with Kelly was employed against her eventual choice. Minnesota governor Tim Walz, who served in the National Guard for 24 years, was accused by vice president JD Vance of “stolen valor” for his misstatement, while arguing for an assault weapons ban, that “these weapons of war that I carried in war” had no place on civilian streets, though he didn’t serve in combat.\n\nHarris found the chemistry she wanted with the “genuinely self-deprecating” Walz: an all-American decent guy next door, with great values and common sense. “He had no fixed ideas about what the role of vice president would be, saying he would do whatever I found was most useful for him to do.”\n\nShe writes that her senior staff favoured Walz, “to a person”, as did her sister – while husband Doug Emhoff, interestingly, leaned towards Shapiro.\n\nWe will never know if Shapiro or Kelly would have carried their swing states, perhaps changing the outcome of the election.\n\n‘Don’t ever let them make you cry’\n\nTrump’s outrages on the campaign trail were rife. Harris takes us behind the scenes to reveal her reactions to key moments, like Trump’s infamous statement to the National Association with Black Journalists: “I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black.” (Her mother is Indian; her father Jamaican.) \n\nTo campaign aide Brian Fallon, who wanted her to “punch back with a big speech about my racial identity”, she retorted:\n\nToday he wants me to prove my race. What next? He’ll say I’m not a woman and I’ll need to show my vagina?\n\nHarris takes us into her July 25 meeting with Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu during her campaign. She also tells us she believes Israel was right to respond to “the atrocities of October 7”, but criticises the “ferocity” of Netanyahu’s response, including “the number of innocent Palestinian women and children killed and his failure to prioritize the lives of the hostages”. She was tough. \n\n“I interrupted to reiterate the need for an immediate ceasefire and a day-after plan that gave Palestinians some kind of political horizon.” Netanyahu did not like what he was hearing – especially from her. “He wanted Trump in the seat opposite him. Not Joe. Not me.”\n\nHarris does acknowledge Biden gaffes, like when he put on the MAGA hat of a Trump supporter he was joking with, who offered it to him. Her internal monologue went: “Don’t take it […] Don’t put it on.” Then: “He put it on.” That photo carried the caption, “Biden endorses Trump over Harris.” A bad day on a trail that had only 107 days. \n\nWhen Harris talks about being a woman in politics, she sounds a lot like Julia Gillard. \n\n“As any woman in a public-facing job knows, it takes us longer,” she writes about the two hours she needed to get ready on the campaign trail – make-up, hairstyling, “more complicated apparel choices”. Women are still judged on these seeming trivialities, she writes, over “the consequential matters we’re engaged in”.\n\nShe relates a conversation with German chancellor Angela Merkel. “They used to call me this – this ugly bird. And at first it hurt me deeply.” Angela leant towards Kamala. “Don’t ever let them make you cry.”\n\nHarris never does.\n\n‘I know Donald Trump’s type’\n\nHarris’ speeches hit Trump where it hurts. As California’s attorney general, she told crowds:\n\nI took on predators of all kinds […] Predators who abused women, who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own game. So hear me when I say […] I know Donald Trump’s type.\n\nThe crowds “exploded” at this line, she writes. \n\nThere are phrases in English that do a lot of work for you. “I know his type” is one of them. We’ve all said it about someone of low character whom we’ve personally known.\n\nShe had big rallies. And big money. She was fully competitive.\n\nHarris told America what Day One of President Kamala Harris would look like. “When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list full of priorities on what I will get done for the American people.”\n\nBy contrast: “On day one, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list.” Does anyone following American politics today doubt that?\n\nBy her own account, the wisest advisor in her campaign was David Plouffe, who ran Barack Obama’s successful 2008 campaign. But like a Shakespearean ghost, Plouffe’s warnings haunt this play. He counselled her Trump was doing better than in 2016 and 2020, and the assassination attempt had pushed his turnout up 20%. “Whatever you think his turnout will be, add ten per cent.” \n\nHer campaign strategists were not happy about Harris’ continued praise for Biden in her speeches, urging her to stop. Plouffe put it bluntly: “People hate Joe Biden.” Harris quotes those words twice.\n\nWhy does she believe she lost?\n\nThis is her verdict: “One hundred and seven days were not, in the end, long enough to accomplish the task of winning the presidency.”\n\nTrump got three million more votes in 2024 than he did in 2020. Harris got six million fewer votes than she and Biden did in 2020.\n\nAll that Harris was proud of – the landmark legislation on infrastructure, health care and clean energy – would not deliver their full benefits before the election. In the run up to November, she writes, inflation and interest rates were high, and there was no immediate relief.\n\nHarris wanted to talk directly to Trump supporters, but it never happened. She wrote:\n\nI wished I could ask every one of them. What are you angry about? What about me makes you angry? Is it your health care, your grocery bills, a backbreaking job that doesn’t pay what you’re worth – and what can I do to help you?\n\nShe did not reach them.\n\nShe combated Trump’s strength on immigration and border issues, and the issue of Gen Z facing a future without good prospects. An anti-trans campaign ripped across the country: “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.” It was reported more than US$21 million was spent by Trump and Republicans on anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ television ads as of October 9 2024.\n\nHarris peaked in mid-September. She never had a lead clear of the polls’ margin of error. \n\nOn election day, she believed she would win.","summary":"In her campaign memoir, Kamala Harris reveals her true thoughts on Joe Biden, takes us behind the scenes of her presidential candidacy and dishes the occasional dirt.","url":"https://theconversation.com/kamala-harris-candid-memoir-reveals-her-ideal-vice-president-and-why-she-thinks-she-lost-266047","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693559/original/file-20250930-56-jz4e2v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C49%2C3999%2C1999&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 00:48:32","author":"Bruce Wolpe,Non-resident Senior Fellow,United States Study Centre,University of Sydney","authors":["Bruce Wolpe","Non-resident Senior Fellow","United States Study Centre","University of Sydney"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.114},{"id":365317630,"title":"White House withdraws E.J.
