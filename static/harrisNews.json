In one of Harris' sorties during the campaign, Stallion performed the song \"Body\" while expressing her support for the then-Vice President of the U.S.A.According to rapper Glasses Malone, there are parallels to what Stallion did during Harris' 2024 campaign to pop star Nicki Minaj's appearance at Erika Kirk’s Turning Point USA Event earlier this month. For Malone, Minaj's talk with Kirk was not worse than when Stallion twerked during Harris' campaign. \"No. Because Megan is a twerker,\" Malone said. \"If Nikki would have got up there and bust a rap, we could have just talked s**t and it would have been the end of it. Bust a rap. Just get up there and rap.\"He clarified later on that he did not want to put anyone in a box, the same way \"white folks\" did to NBA superstar LeBron James, when he was speaking up on social issues. \"I don't want to do her like, you know, I'm not like the white folks saying to LeBron James like, you know, shut up and dribble,\" Malone said. \"I'm saying don't try to fly a rocket, (like) talk about the s**t you know,\" he added. Currently, Stallion has been in the news for her relationship with Dallas Mavericks guard Thompson. Megan Thee Stallion shows love for Klay Thompson through cookingMegan Thee Stallion has been focusing on her relationship with Klay Thompson in the past months. During Thanksgiving, Stallion said she cooked for the Thompson family to prove her love to the Mavericks player during one of her Instagram videos. “I was really nervous because I was like, ‘Dang, I’m really finna cook for my man and his whole family,'” she said. “I hope they love this because to show them that I really love their son.”In a separate interview with ESPN, Stallion gave a glimpse of what happened in the kitchen. “Ms. Julie was the star of the show. Ms. Julie was the hostess with the mostest,” she said. “Mr. Thompson said I could own my own restaurant. I am glad that I got the stamp of approval from the father. But Ms. Julie was my number one stamp of approval.”Stallion has been Stallion has been seen supporting Thompson during games as the Mavericks look to climb up the Western Conference standings in the upcoming weeks.","summary":"Klay Thompson's girlfriend Megan Thee Stallion has been vocal about her support for Kamala Harris during her run for the presidency in 2024.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/news-glasses-malone-drops-wild-megan-thee-stallion-parallel-nicki-minaj-s-appearance-erika-kirk-s-turning-point-usa-event","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/12/27885542-1766867116.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 21:13:09","author":"Rob Andrew Lo","authors":["Rob Andrew Lo"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.208},{"id":389507050,"title":"Kennedy Center Head Richard Grenell Draws Spotlight After Trump Name Backlash","text":"Richard Grenell has suddenly become a name people are searching as controversy swirls around the Kennedy Center’s leadership and its expanding political storm. Grenell, a long-time Republican and close Trump ally, was appointed president of the Kennedy Center earlier this year after President Donald Trump reshaped the board.\n\nThe latest dispute began after the center’s board — appointed under Trump’s chairmanship — voted to add Trump’s name to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Within days, jazz musician Chuck Redd canceled his annual Christmas Eve concert, explicitly citing the name change as his reason for withdrawing. Redd told The Associated Press, via WDTV, that when he “saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert.”\n\nJazz musician Chuck Redd hosted the Kennedy Center annual Christmas Eve jazz event for 20 years.\nHe cancelled this year after the Kennedy Center board at Trump’s urging renamed the center the Trump-Kennedy Center.\nHats off to Mr. Redd!\nTrump and his appointees violated the… pic.twitter.com/zArgfgyyhm\n— Feisty is proud to be a Democrat! (@FeistyLibLady) December 26, 2025\n\nThat cancellation hit a cultural nerve. According to WSLS, Grenell fired back in a strongly worded letter to Redd, calling the decision “classic intolerance” and saying it was costly for the nonprofit arts institution. He added that the center would seek $1 million in damages “for this political stunt.”\n\nThe clash over the music event is now entwined with broader legal and political fights. Democratic Representative Joyce Beatty of Ohio has filed a lawsuit to challenge the name change, arguing that altering the Kennedy Center’s name without Congressional approval might violate federal law. She also claims she was muted during the virtual board vote and prevented from speaking.\n\nThe left is boycotting the Arts because Trump is supporting the Arts.\nBut we will not let them cancel shows without consequences.\nThe Arts are for everyone – and the Left is mad about it. https://t.co/zej4PnBNtz\n— Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) December 27, 2025\n\nAnd to top all the controversy surrounding the center, the broadcast of the Kennedy Center Honors hit a historical low this year. “The Kennedy Center Honors on CBS drew its smallest audience ever on the night of December 23, 2025, averaging an estimated 2.65 million viewers,” Programming Insider data revealed. If Trump thought that his stint as the host for the annual event would draw the numbers, he was sadly wrong.\n\nGrenell’s rise to the top of the Kennedy Center was part of a sweeping overhaul initiated by Trump earlier in 2025. Before this role, Grenell served as the United States ambassador to Germany and as acting director of national intelligence, both under Trump’s previous administration. He also worked in foreign policy and media before returning to public service.\n\nCritics say Grenell’s leadership style and political ties have injected partisan tensions into what was traditionally a bipartisan cultural institution. Since the renaming and leadership changes, several artists and performers have distanced themselves from the Kennedy Center, citing discomfort over the institution’s direction after the Trump name was added, per People.\n\n🚨NEW: Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (D-OH) has filed a lawsuit to stop the Trump Administration from renaming the Kennedy Center, claiming that only Congress has the legal authority to do so.\nRETWEET to thank @RepBeatty for standing up to Donald Trump! pic.twitter.com/3Spl8R1Ypq\n— Protect Kamala Harris ✊ (@DisavowTrump20) December 23, 2025\n\nFor many arts fans and observers, the Redd cancellation wasn’t isolated. Even earlier this year, musicians and performers expressed frustration with Grenell’s management, including an exchange of emails about diversity and programming decisions that went viral.9\n\nSupporters of Grenell argue he is defending the center’s financial health and broad audience reach. But opponents see the latest legal and cultural fights as emblematic of how deeply politics has seeped into an institution once seen as a national cultural bridge.\n\nAs debate over the Kennedy Center’s name and mission continues to escalate, Grenell’s role — and his ties to Trump — remain central to the controversy, keeping his name trending in both the cultural and political spotlight.","summary":"A cultural fight puts the Kennedy Center’s leader in the headlines again","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/kennedy-center-head-richard-grenell-draws-spotlight-after-trump-name-backlash","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Richard-Grenell-Donald-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 19:31:58","author":"Tracey Ashlee","authors":["Tracey Ashlee"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.127},{"id":389509774,"title":"Can We Stop Pretending Kwanzaa Is a Real Holiday?","text":"Karenga didn't hide what he was doing, either. He openly described Kwanzaa as a cultural and political project meant to give African Americans an explicitly ideological alternative to Christmas. Everything about it — the timing, the symbolism, the rituals — was deliberately constructed to serve that purpose. There's nothing ancient or traditional about it. It's less than 60 years old.\n\nBut tell that to the NFL.\n\nOn Friday, my social media feeds filled up with \"Happy Kwanzaa\" posts from professional football teams. MLB and NBA teams joined the parade, too. All of them rushing to celebrate a holiday that most black Americans don’t actually observe. But because Kwanzaa gets pitched as a black holiday, corporate America loves to virtue signal its support for anything related to diversity, and so it is essentially compelled to pretend the holiday is important. So the posts roll out, graphics get designed, and we’re supposed to “ooooh” and “ahhhh” and pretend this matters.\n\nWhile professional sports teams were crawling all over each other with their stupid Kwanzaa messages, the real proof that posting about Kwanzaa is just shameless pandering came from none other than Kamala Harris.\n\nLast year, when she was still vice president, she posted a Kwanzaa message from her official account. \"When I was growing up, Kwanzaa was a special time of reflection with family and friends,\" she wrote. \"Let us carry the wisdom of the seven principles with us as we work to build a brighter future. Happy Kwanzaa.\"\n\nWhen I was growing up, Kwanzaa was a special time of reflection with family and friends.

Happy Kwanzaa. pic.twitter.com/LtMJdp4ss4— Vice President Kamala Harris Archived (@VP46Archive) December 26, 2024\n\nThis year, however, the only holiday message she shared was a Christmas post, sharing a selfie of her and her Jewish husband.\n\nFrom our family to yours, merry Christmas! We hope your day is filled with good people and good food. pic.twitter.com/SPQgkyRd8S— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) December 25, 2025\n\n It is now the day after Kwanzaa, and there is nothing on her X or Facebook accounts acknowledging the holiday she previously claimed was a tradition in her household.\n\nOf course, that story was a steaming pile of crap, too. Kamala was born in 1964, two years before the holiday even existed. No one truly believes her family celebrated this brand-new, barely known pseudo-holiday when she was a toddler. On top of that, Kamala is of Indian and Jamaican descent, not African. Her parents divorced in 1972, when she was seven, and she was raised primarily by her Indian mother, who followed Hindu traditions. The idea that Kwanzaa played any significant role in her childhood is absurd. Kamala didn't even try to identify as black until she ran for president.\n\nNow that she's out of public office and not running for anything, Kamala couldn't be bothered to acknowledge Kwanzaa this year. The holiday she once claimed was central to her identity? Gone. Not even a perfunctory tweet. She doesn't need to pretend anymore.\n\nBut professional sports teams? They're still at it, flooding social media with Kwanzaa greetings for a holiday almost nobody celebrates. It's performative nonsense, and everyone knows it. But seriously, enough is enough. If Kamala can’t even bother to pretend anymore, neither should anyone else.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2025/12/27/can-we-stop-pretending-kwanzaa-is-a-real-holiday-n4947590","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2011/286/543a986c-a6c3-47f5-a72e-f27941ba2664@news.ap.org.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 19:23:00","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.192},{"id":389484520,"title":"Trump says midterms will revolve around ‘pricing’ – despite claiming affordability was a Democrat ‘hoax’","text":"President Donald Trump said that the 2026 midterm elections will revolve around “pricing” despite repeatedly describing affordability as a “hoax” perpetuated by Democrats.\n\nDuring an interview with Politico on Friday, the Republican president expressed confidence that midterm voters — who will decide which party controls Congress next year — will embrace his economic agenda.\n\n“I think it’s going to be about the success of our country. It’ll be about pricing,” Trump told the outlet. “Because, you know, they gave us high pricing, and we’re bringing it down. Energy’s way down. Gasoline is way down.”\n\nThe president’s recent emphasis on the cost of living comes after Democrats romped to victory in a string of states earlier this year, largely by tapping into economic concerns.\n\nRecognizing the potency of the issue, Trump went on the offensive, hitting the campaign trail in Pennsylvania earlier this month to highlight his economic agenda and assuage anxieties. However, he veered off script and repeatedly downplayed worries.\n\n“They have a new word. You know, they always have a hoax. The new word is affordability,” Trump said during a December 9 speech in Mount Pocono.\n\nDemocrats have complained that “prices are too high,” Trump added. “Yeah, they're too high because they caused them to be too high. But now they're coming down.”\n\nHe also advocated for austerity measures, stating that American children should be content with “one or two” pencils and “two or three” dolls.\n\nA day earlier, the president appeared supremely satisfied at the state of the U.S. economy, giving it an “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus” rating in an interview with Politico.\n\nTrump’s latest comments come on the heels of a series of economic reports showing the economy performing better than many expected.\n\nIn November, inflation fell to 2.7 percent year-over-year, the smallest increase recorded since July, according to the latest consumer price index report from the Labor Department. And data published by the government this week revealed that the economy grew at an annual rate of 4.3 percent, the fastest clip in two years.\n\n“You saw the 4.3 percent?” Trump said to Politico on Friday. “The Democrats were exploding. Their heads were exploding.”\n\n“Electricity is down. It’s way down,” Trump added. “You know, when the gasoline goes down and when the oil and gas go down, the electricity comes down naturally. But it’s all coming down. It’s all coming down. It’s coming beautifully.”\n\nStill, other indicators paint a less favorable picture of the economy. For example, between January and November, corporate bankruptcies soared to a 15-year high as companies struggled to cope with Trump’s trade wars.\n\nAnd recent polls show that most Americans — including many of Trump’s own voters — are indeed feeling squeezed by the present economic climate.\n\nA Politico survey conducted in November revealed that 46 percent of respondents believe the current cost of living is the worst they can remember. This figure includes 37 percent of Trump 2024 voters and 53 percent of voters who cast their ballots for former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAt the same time, nearly half reported struggling to afford essentials like groceries, health care and housing, while more than a quarter said they’ve skipped medical appointments in the past two years due to high costs.","summary":"President’s comments come after a series of recent economic reports showed the economy performing better than many expected","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-midterms-pricing-affordability-hoax-b2890984.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/27/17/13/GettyImages-2252765745.jpeg?crop=8256,5504,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mfVMsyhz-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-27 18:35:11","author":"Brendan Rascius","authors":["Brendan Rascius"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.247},{"id":389490186,"title":"Too Fun to Check: Has Hunter Gone MAGA?","text":"Alternate headline: Second look at nepo babies?\n\nThe poster boy for dissipated scions has decided to re-insert himself into the public consciousness, apparently not yet satisfied with his presidential pardon from his padre's puppeteers. Earlier this week, Hunter Biden opened up on a podcast about a wide range of topics, including his father's performance in the White House. First, though, Hunter decided to set the record straight on the infamous laptop that Joe Biden insisted was a Russian intelligence operation, his lawyers claimed was privileged and stolen, and that Hunter now says ... never existed?\n\nHunter Biden told podcaster Shawn Ryan in an interview that aired Monday that former Republican Mayor Rudy Giuliani of New York City “concocted” the laptop that was the subject of an October 2020 New York Post report. ...“What I can tell you about the laptop is that there is no laptop. That’s bullshit. What was provided out there, what the-” Biden said, with Ryan asking, “There was no fucking laptop?”“There is an actual physical laptop that somebody had, but the guy that had, that said he had the laptop, the existence of the search for the laptop came before he was even a twinkle in Rudy Giuliani’s eye,” Biden said. “There were people, talk to Lev Parnas. Lev Parnas literally went to Ukraine to get a laptop from Dmytro Firtash, to get a hard drive, Hunter Biden’s hard drive from Dmytro Firtash and Andrii Derkach, in Ukraine, in Austria, four months before John Paul Mac Isaac ever even… existed. And so, what they did is they cobbled together [a] stolen, concocted, fabricated mishmash of digital information, largely, which is, you know, thousands and thousands and thousands of emails… from 25 years. I mean, no laptop could have held all of that.”\n\nOh, I don't know ... My new Macbook Pro came with a two-terabyte drive. That's more than enough room for all of my photography and email storage needs, even the pics of my experiences with hookers, blow, and guns. Of course, I mean this theoretically, since this laptop actually belongs to the Powers That Be of Townhall. Theoretical, I say. \n\nReally, fellas. I only have my church photography on it. Anything else on it was planted on me by the guys at Power Line. I, uh, dropped it off at a repair shop in Minneapolis, and ... you know the rest. It could be a Fraters Libertas dirty trick, too.\n\nTruly, though, this latest claim from Hunter might tend to dent his credibility on other matters, and that's too bad. Hunter sounded much more connected to reality when it came to assessing his father's legacy as president, at least to the extent that Joe ever was president. Hunter decided to weigh in on two of his father's biggest disasters in the same podcast with Shawn Ryan, immigration and Afghanistan. And Hunter acknowledged the reality of both:\n\nDisgraced first son Hunter Biden turned on his father, Joe, in a wide-ranging podcast interview this week, acknowledging that the 46th president’s lax immigration policy and move to pull US forces out of Afghanistan were both catastrophic failures.“We need vibrant immigration,” the 55-year-old told “The Shawn Ryan Show” during a five-and-a-half-hour conversation that dropped Monday.“But we don’t want immigrants that are coming here illegally, draining us of resources, and being prioritized above people that are actual, literal heroes, that are still recovering from 21, 20 years of endless war — or anybody else in our society.”\n\nHunter did try to shift the blame to Trump, but ...\n\n“And then Donald Trump stepped in six months before the [2024] election, and told [Republicans] that he was gonna primary every single one of them that voted for that, because we’re addicted to the problem,” said the younger Biden.\n\nYeah, well, good luck with that explanation. The crisis began as soon as Joe took office and reversed Trump's tough policies on asylum and border security. House Democrat Henry Cuellar tried to warn the Biden team about the coming catastrophe, but Joe and Kamala Harris got exactly what they wanted out of it. They wanted to pressure Republicans into accepting a high level of illegal immigration as a new baseline with that bill in exchange for a minimal amount of enforcement, claiming that it was the only way to solve the problem. Trump exposed this flim-flam within weeks of taking office, eliminating the border flood altogether without any new legislation at all. \n\nHunter didn't even attempt a blame-shift on Afghanistan:\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Hunter admitted to interviewer Shawn Ryan that the botched bugout from Afghanistan “was an obvious f—ing failure.”“I think that there was a better way to do it, and … I can blame it on his generals, I can blame it on [other] people [for] the way in which we did it, but — and my dad always knew this also, is that the buck stops with him.”\n\nWell ... yeah, and that's exactly what MAGA argues, too. Donald Trump actually did have a better way to do it, which would have allowed for us to hold Bagram as a way to secure Kabul and the Afghan government we had meticulously nurtured for two decades. It still might have collapsed over time anyway, but it wouldn't have created Saigon II: Taliban Bug-Out-aloo. The rout in Kabul exposed Biden as an incompetent to not just MAGA but to everyone, and Biden's approval ratings never recovered from it. \n\nOf course, Hunter is not going to put on a red cap and shout \"USA! USA!\" at the next Trump rally. But at least he's a little more connected to reality than the rest of his family. \n\nEditor’s Note: Every single day, here at Hot Air, we will stand up and FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT against the radical left and deliver the conservative reporting our readers deserve.

During a discussion on “Kudlow,” guest host David Asman asked why prominent left-wing billionaires have not stepped in to help stabilize the DNC’s finances. Epstein said the silence from the donor class reflects a broader “vote of no confidence” in the Democratic Party.\n\n“I think what we’re seeing with the donor class right now is a lack of confidence, a vote of no confidence in the Democrats. And I think it stems back to a couple things,” Epstein told Asman. “The lie about Biden’s mental health, the incompetency of the Harris campaign, and the fact that all of the data shows that the Democratic Party is deeply out of touch on almost every single economic and social cultural issue.”\n\nEpstein said elite donors helped pull Democrats away from the political center.\n\n“The irony here, David, is that the donor class is perhaps the most leftist class of the Democratic Party. They are the ones driving the Democratic Party to be out of touch. Now they are withholding their money because they don’t like the results of sort of the far-left drift,” Epstein added. “So I don’t really know where the Democrats go from here. I’ve argued for a Sister Souljah moment, but I don’t think a lot of people are listening to that.”\n\nThe DNC’s debt problems are not new, as the committee entered the midterm cycle months ago at a clear financial disadvantage, weighed down by lingering debt from former Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2024 presidential campaign and weak donor enthusiasm. At the time, the Republican National Committee reported raising $10.7 million in September with roughly $86 million in cash on hand, while the DNC brought in $10.3 million and held about $12 million in reserves.\n\nThe strain partly traces back to liabilities carried over from Harris’s failed presidential bid, which spent roughly $1.5 billion in just over three months. The DNC shelled out another $1.6 million in September to settle campaign-related bills, pushing total payments linked to Harris’s effort past $20 million, according to Axios.\n\n(Featured Image Media Credit: Screenshot/Fox Business)\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Who that?\" I was like, \"I got to change it up a little bit.\"' \nIn February, as he paid a visit to Late Night With Seth Myers, Davidson also discussed getting rid of his tattoos. \nThe actor explained that he didn't initially understand that the process would take years. \n\nView gallery\n\nA second image showed Hewitt also holding their baby Scottie who was swaddled in a pink blanket\n\nView gallery\n\nEarlier this year in January, a source told People that the actor 'just woke up one day and wanted them gone, and it's been a years-long process'; seen in 2021 \n\nView gallery\n\nIn regards to what caused the star to begin the removal journey, he explained, 'I got sober and I saw myself in the mirror and I was like, \"Nah.

But if it's a color tattoo, it takes forever.'\nSeth Myers then asked if there was a tattoo that he was thrilled to remove, to which Pete replied, 'All of them.'\nThe Pickup actor added, 'Well, I made a lot of those decisions when, you know, before rehab. So I got the dumbest tattoos.' \nDavidson has also reportedly been sober for around a year, and in July 2024, he checked into a wellness facility to seek treatment for his mental health, including PTSD and borderline personality disorder. \nBack in 2023, the actor also spent time at a facility to focus on his mental health - with a source telling People at the time that mental health has 'always been a priority' for Davidson. \nAn insider explained: 'Pete will often check himself into rehab to work on these issues. His friends and family have been supportive during this time.' \nPete has been open about the topic for years, and he previously told Variety in 2018 that he has 'been in and out of mental-health facilities' since he was nine. \n\nPete Davidson kisses pregnant girlfriend Elsie at their baby shower\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:13\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nView gallery\n\n'No, I didn't realize it would take — like, when I'm 40, it'll all be gone, like the chest and the back,' he said; seen in 2023 on SNL\n\nView gallery\n\nOn December 18, it was announced that he and Elsie welcomed their first child together - a daughter named Scottie - on December 12\nHe added, 'The last few years have been real rough with me.

This trio has seemingly provided enough far-left rhetoric (anti-rule-of-law, pro-open-borders, “defund the police” and wreck the economy via “universal income,” etc.) to ensure tens of millions of “common sense” Americans will come out to vote against their policies in 2026 and 2028. Next, we have Minnesota Governor Tim Walz (D). He is the gift which keeps on giving if you are a Republican, a fan of President Trump, or in favor of not having your hard-earned federal tax money stolen. First, he became the anchor attached to the 2024 Kamala Harris campaign, helping to sink that political vessel through his own personal flights of fancy and provable ineptitude. But now Walz surfaces yet again amid a Minnesota mess of fraud. The story is reminding the public why Trump is entirely correct to push for a regulated and secure immigration system, while also fighting to ensure that immigrants don’t game the system to abuse Americans' natural generosity. Under Walz's leadership, Minnesota has become the poster child for the issues of both immigration and fraud. Billions are alleged to have been stolen or misappropriated — shocking allegations which have naturally spurred many to look much more deeply into the finances of other blue states led by Democratic governors. Gavin Newsom's California, anyone? All of a sudden, more and more Americans are starting to wonder how many tens of billions of their taxpayer dollars have potentially been stolen in these blue-democratic cities and states. Republicans did not cause them to think that way, but rather repeated Democratic miscues in those cities and states. For a brief, shining moment, some Democrats believed they had stumbled upon an issue that would hurt Trump and the Republicans heading into 2026: “affordability.” Not so much anymore. On its own, the scandal in Minnesota derails that potentially winning issue, since it bothers tens of millions of hard-working American citizens who often have so little for themselves and their families. It is hardly \"affordable\" to have Democratic policies, enabled by Democrats' incompetence, make a mockery of their understanding and kindness toward newcomers. But now we also have the nation's GDP growing at a \"blistering 4.3 percent\" annual pace. Fears about inflation are subsiding, thanks to strong wage growth and Trump's own affordability policies. That is an economic victory for Trump and the Republicans, and it has to be cited in every left-of-center news outlet across the country. To one extent or the other, bread and butter issues are always top of mind for most Americans, especially the working class. And no matter which narrative the Democrats use to attack Trump, those same Americans realize that he is the first true businessman to inhabit the Oval Office in their lifetimes — a massively successful one at that, who has built an iconic global brand. As we head into the new year and its critically important November elections, several questions arise for the Democrats as they gaze into the mirror: Who are we? Have we confused the American electorate with our split personalities? What can we honestly tout as a victory? How will we deal with the coming civil war with the far left if we pretend to be more centrist? And how many more misappropriated-money shoes are still to drop? In the meantime, Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and the Republicans are in charge. They will gladly stand aside and let the public's focus fall on all the Democratic infighting to come.

Gavin Newsom moved himself into front-runner status for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028, emerging from a pack of contenders to clear leading status. It was a strong year for Newsom, whose combative approach to taking on President Trump resonated with Democrats and won favorable headlines for his team. “The headline on Newsom is that this year, he became the default answer of who Democrats are thinking about for 2028,” Democratic strategist Joel Payne said. “He became the stand-in at a time when the party was looking for leadership and a good spokesperson.\" “Newsom has been the officeholder who has been in the best position to counter Trump,” he said. The question for Newsom and his operation going forward is whether he can keep the excitement level up and maintain front-runner status past the midterm elections, after which the presidential battle will really heat up. Despite his strong 2025, some Democrats have openly wondered if it’s possible Newsom is peaking too soon. “He fits the mood of the country and the party now, but things change quickly,” one Democratic consultant said. “Politics is all about timing, and it may be too soon. We’re still at least a year away from that cycle starting.” Newsom’s lead in the Real Clear Politics average of polls for the Democratic nomination is narrow. He gets 23.6 percent compared with former Vice President Kamala Harris’s 21.4 percent in an average of polls taken between Aug. 25 and Dec. 19. Newsom’s lead is wider in one recent poll. An Atlas Intel poll this month, for example, had him getting 35 percent support compared with 16 percent for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who is widely seen as a strong candidate from the left. Two other recent polls included in the Real Clear Politics average, however, show him with just a percentage point lead over Harris in the case of an Echelon Insights poll, and trailing the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee by 11 points in a Big Data Poll. Whether any of those polls mean anything is also a matter of debate. “It’s insane to anoint anyone a front-runner or look at polls this far out,” said Democratic strategist Eddie Vale, who opined that Newsom “had a great year.” “It’s a very open question to see if that success translates into Democratic primary voters thinking he can win the electoral college,” Vale added. A CNN poll out this past week showed Newsom leading other would-be candidates on the Democratic side. But the same poll also said two-thirds of those surveyed said they didn’t have a specific candidate in mind for 2028. That’s a reminder that while the Beltway class is heavily focused on 2028, most of the country is not. Either way, Newsom has solidified his brand over the last year as the Trump battler-in-chief. Just last week, for example, Newsom took to social platform X to hit Trump on his newly installed White House hall of presidents, where he used plaques to hit former Democratic presidents including Joe Biden and Barack Obama. “Inflation is up. Unemployment is up. Grocery prices are up. Electricity costs are up. And Donald Trump is spending his time doing this,” Newsom wrote in his post on X. On a more substantive level, Newsom led the effort on behalf of California’s Proposition 50, the ballot measure that voters overwhelmingly approved in November to redraw the state’s congressional districts to give Democrats an edge. The effort was a direct response to a Trump-backed effort by Texas Republicans to help GOP House candidates in the Lone Star State. It was a national political fight given its implications on the 2026 battle for the House majority. If Democrats do win back control of the House, it will be a considerable curb on Trump’s power over the latter half of his term. “I think it was brilliant and it was needed,” Democratic strategist Adam Parkhomenko said of the Newsom-led redistricting fight in California. “He showed that he’s not only talking the talk but walking the walking.\" “He has shown Democrats how to fight like it’s 2028. Not 1998,” Parkhomenko added. “And the key is that he didn’t necessarily invent a new playbook. He took Trump’s and made it better.” A Democratic donor added that Newsom “helped carry the Democratic Party on his shoulders this year while most of the party was asleep.” Trump has also helped to keep Newsom in the heart of the news cycle, frequently taking aim at the Democrat while helping to burnish his brand as a fighter, Democrats say. Last month, in an interview with Fox News, Trump called Newsom a “horrible governor.” “I knew Gavin for four years,” Trump said at the time. “I get along great with him. But he’s gone radical left.” In the months ahead — particularly as he eyes 2028 — Democrats say Newsom will have to pivot from Trump-bashing to a purveyor of ideas, particularly on economic issues. “He has tried a 1000-flowers-bloom approach and has done a little bit of everything and that’s OK for now, but he has to define what his path is going to be,” Payne said. “I imagine we will start to get a glimpse of what a post-gubernatorial Newsom sounds like in the coming months. The big question is what issue does he glom onto and make his hobby horse?” But so far, Democrats say, the nomination fight is his to lose. “I think the only one who could f‑‑‑ it up for Gavin Newsom is Gavin Newsom,” Parkhomenko said.","url":"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5662785-newsom-trump-battler-2028/","image":"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/Newsom_Parnes_AP_KarenWarren.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 17:00:00","author":"Amie Parnes","authors":["Amie Parnes"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.041},{"id":389457142,"title":"Lizzo Trashes Nicki Minaj After TPUSA Appearance: Joined Trump's 'Side' for Money & 'Privileges'","text":"Left-wing pop star and Kamala Harris 2024 presidential surrogate Lizzo claims rap megastar Nicki Minaj only joined President Donald Trump’s “side” because she sees it as “more profitable and more beneficial,” predicting that the public will start seeing “an influx” of celebrities who will follow suit.\n\nRather than look into the reasons why Minaj would support President Trump, Lizzo oversimplified the matter by chalking it up as the “Super Bass” singer simply seeking “money” and certain “privileges.”\n\n“So I’m getting texts, like, about Nicki, and I’m like, ‘What are you talking about?’ I didn’t even know,” Lizzo said, adding, “Then I researched and saw what was going on, and I’m gonna say it like this: celebrities’ opinions of other celebrities does not matter — so my opinion of her does not matter.”\n\n“But what I will tell you is you’re about to see an influx of people who see that it is more profitable and more beneficial to join that side. You’re gonna see it. It already started, and it’s going to continue,” the “Rumors” singer continued.\n\nLizzo went on to say, “We got three more years” of Trump being president, during which time there will be “people who are going to surprise you,” suggesting that she knows there are closet conservatives in the entertainment industry who may feel emboldened to let their opinions be known in the coming years.\n\n“It’s going to hurt your feelings,” Lizzo told her fans. “It’s going to disappoint you.”\n\n“And you have to know that, like, there’s money behind everything,” she added. “There are privileges behind every move people in these positions make, and I’m not surprised.”\n\nInterestingly, Lizzo’s comments about Minaj convey that the “Truth Hurts” singer — who endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 election — holds the narrow-minded view that no one could possibly see any advantage in supporting a Republican president unless they have some financial incentive.\n\nMoreover, some may see the pop star’s remark that “there’s money behind everything” as Lizzo — who has gone to bat for Democrats — inadvertently revealing that she might know celebrities can, in fact, be paid for political endorsements, including possibly by Democrats, which the left has denied.\n\nBut for decades, it has been widely understood that many conservatives in the entertainment industry deliberately hide or downplay their political views in public, strongly suggesting that they do not see openly supporting Republicans as beneficial to their careers, which exist in an industry dominated by the left.\n\nNotably, Lizzo’s remarks come after Minaj took the stage at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest last weekend, where she praised President Trump and said that being at the event was more important than any concert she has ever performed anywhere in the world, because slain conservative icon Charlie Kirk’s organization is “a direct link between young people and God.”\n\nBut Minaj has also offered reasons as to why she supports Trump, citing the president intervening and taking the “mass slaughter” of Christians in Nigeria by radical Islamists “seriously” — an issue that is close to her heart.\n\nOn Christmas, President Trump announced that he directed the United States to carry out a “powerful and deadly strike” against ISIS terrorists in Nigeria, whom he identified as responsible for targeting and killing innocent Christians at historically severe levels.\n\nAlana Mastrangelo is a reporter for Breitbart News.

She outperformed Kamala Harris in 48 of Virginia’s 52 rural localities.\n\nNational Democrats, excited by Spanberger’s success, have made their own moves: Beyond the DCCC’s eight-figure investment into rural voters and voters of color and the new farmer-focused ad campaigns, a caucus of more than 100 moderate Democratic lawmakers recently released a policy agenda that includes passing a farm bill, expanding rural broadband funding and federal funding for local food purchases.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Kush Desai defended the Trump administration’s policies and said “supporting rural Americans has been a key focus,” which is why the administration has sought to use tariffs to open up new export markets for farmers.\n\nThe RNC isn’t fazed either.\n\n“Rural America won’t suddenly be tricked into thinking elite Democrats stand for their beliefs and values. The DNC spending a few bucks won’t fool rural Americans into thinking Democrats have touched grass,” RNC spokesperson Delanie Bomar said.\n\nOne Big Beautiful Mess\n\nTrump’s signature tax-and-spending law provides Democrats with another opening to contrast their pitch against Republicans.\n\nRural health care centers across the country have already shuttered in response to the law’s Medicaid cuts, which will disproportionately hit communities where hospitals are few and often primary employers. Low-income Americans are quickly learning they may no longer qualify for federal food aid — even as most of the tax breaks the GOP has touted will benefit the wealthy.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association and represents a ruby red state, recently called the law “a slap in the face to rural America.”\n\nAnd POLITICO’s November poll revealed that voters are more likely to rely on Democrats when it comes to health care policy. More than 40 percent of those surveyed said they trusted Democrats to bring down health care costs for ordinary Americans, compared with 33 percent who said they trusted the GOP.\n\nThe message for Democrats is “wrapped up and with a nice, tidy bow on it in the Big, Beautiful Bill,” said Christopher Borick, a political science professor who runs the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. “It’s cuts to your health care, it’s cuts to rural hospitals. It’s cuts to SNAP benefits, and it’s just so tidy and neat for Democrats to go there.”\n\nThe strategy seems to be working. In a heavily Republican congressional district in Tennessee, Democrat Aftyn Behn beat expectations and outperformed Harris’ 2024 margins in a bid to unseat GOP Rep. Matt Van Epps this month.\n\nBehn’s ads largely focused on affordability and the fallout from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which she called the “one big BS bill.”\n\nThat tactic resonated with voters in an off-cycle election and will only gain steam: Americans’ health care premiums are set to skyrocket ahead of the 2026 midterms after Republicans declined to extend Covid-era “enhanced” subsidies of Affordable Care Act plans in their big bill.\n\nWill history repeat itself?\n\nStill, some political experts question how much Democrats can loosen the GOP’s hold on rural America.\n\nThe president’s first-term tariff war also hammered farmers, but their political ties to Republicans hardly wavered at the time. Democrats in 2024 used roughly the same playbook they’re seeking to capitalize on now, arguing that Trump’s proposed policies would increase the cost of living and that his tariffs would impose a new tax on the middle class — but they failed to gain enough ground with rural voters, enabling Republicans to win a trifecta.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/27/democrats-rural-voters-economy-trump-midterms-00700822","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/266c071/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F7e%2F4e%2F69db3c884b4a91b0b1dc8c8c5152%2Fvoting-lists-states-sued-34269.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 15:00:00","author":"Marcia Brown,Rachel Shin,Samuel Benson","authors":["Marcia Brown","Rachel Shin","Samuel Benson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":389490376,"title":"Kim Kardashian's daughter North West shares cozy Christmas moment with dad Kanye's wife Bianca Censori","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBlake Lively\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nU.K. Showbiz\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Dec 27th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaunting final image of 19-year-old who vanished on Christmas Eve in Texas human trafficking hotspot\n\nInside the downfall of newlywed who murdered his wife in dispute over football as tragic note reveals his dark secret\n\nCelebrity Christmas dinners ranked from tasteful to tacky: From a Kardashians feast to JLo's photoshop fail\n\nLate billionaire's heirs agree to pay IRS $750 million to settle biggest individual tax fraud case in US history\n\nYear-end tax trap if you don't act BEFORE December 31: Trump's megabill could cost you thousands... use this expert guide to make sneaky savings and avoid hellish charges\n\nFirst my middle-aged husband was distant.

Ilhan Omar’s husband’s venture capital firm quietly scrubbed key officer details — including former Obama officials — as scrutiny grows over the family’s skyrocketing wealth, The Post has learned.\n\nOmar (D-MN) went from nearly broke to being worth up to $30 million in just a year — as a massive, up to $9 billion fraud scheme involving the Somali community in her district unfolded right under her nose in Minnesota.\n\nClose to 90 people have been charged so far, including at least three with direct ties to the lefty Squad member, though she has not been charged. \n\nIt was Somalia-born Omar — who was seen in a resurfaced video last month dishing out food in a restaurant now at the heart of the scandal — who introduced the legislation critics say paved the way for what the feds have called the largest fraud of the pandemic.\n\nThe Jimmy Choo wearing socialist introduced the MEALS Act in Congress in 2020, relaxing oversight of government sponsored children’s meals programs during the pandemic, which critics say allowed fraudsters to claim they served millions of meals without verification, while pocketing millions of dollars in government subsidies.\n\nShortly after the scheme played out, Omar’s husband, political consultant Tim Mynett, launched Rose Lake Capital in 2022, a venture capital management firm.\n\nThe company saw its reported value go from nearly zero in 2023, to between $5 million and $25 million in just a year, and somehow claims to having already amassed $60 billion assets under management — an amount many money managers on Wall Street only dream of.\n\n“There’s a lot of strange things going on,” said Paul Kamenar, counsel to the National Legal and Policy Center. “She was basically broke when she came into office and now she’s worth perhaps up to $30 million…she needs to come clean on these assets.”\n\nRose Lake Capital, which touts its “deep global networks built from on-the-ground work in more than 80 countries,” had less than $1,000 in assets in 2023, according to Omar’s financial disclosure.\n\nYet despite the reported windfall, the business’s only address is a WeWork in DC, according to its LinkedIn page.\n\nBetween September and October — when federal prosecutors announced charges to eight more individuals, including six of Somali descent, for their roles in the welfare scheme — the names and bios of Rose Lake Capitals’s nine officers and advisors were removed from the website. None of them were charged in the fraud.\n\nThese names include lobbyist and former Obama Ambassador to Bahrain Adam Ereli; former Senator and Obama Ambassador to China Max Baucus; DNC Finance Chair associate Alex Hoffman; former DNC treasurer William Derrough and former ex-CEO of Amalgamated Bank Keith Mestrich, who once described Amalgamated as “the institutional bank of the Democratic Party.” \n\nMeanwhile Mynett’s other business, a California winery that previously faced fraud allegations and was declared a failed venture in 2023, was suddenly worth between $1 million and $5 million in 2024 — a windfall of 9,900%.\n\nThe fraud case involved a wine investor suing Mynett in Oct. 2023, accusing him of swindling him of $900,000 as he “fraudulently misrepresented … that estCru, LLC was a legitimate company.” Mynett claimed he simply struggled to build a business during the pandemic.\n\nThe case settled out of court in November.\n\nThe winery, eStCru, at some point around 2022 promoted a line of wines with names like “Blockchain” and “The Devil’s Lie,” with a prestigious California winemaker who said she abruptly stopped getting paid in early 2023. The business was only worth between $15,000 and $50,000 in Omar’s financial disclosure that year, making the sudden windfall the next year even more puzzling.\n\nIt, too, is listed as operating out of a WeWork, and doesn’t appear to actually sell any wines anymore, according to extensive internet searches.\n\nDespite the high worth placed on the business, its website is a broken link, the phone number is disconnected and the last social media post for the winery dates back to 2023.\n\nWhen she first took office in 2019, the left-wing “Squad” member declared a net worth between negative $25,000 and negative $65,000, claimed to own no assets and only carrying student and car debt.\n\nNow Omar’s assets have suddenly skyrocketed to anywhere between $6 million to $30 million, according to her latest financial disclosure — just months after the congresswoman dismissed claims she was a millionaire as “ridiculous” and “categorically false.” \n\nHer links to the Minnesota welfare scheme have started to come to light in recent weeks.\n\nHer campaign received $7,400 in direct donations from at least three now-convicted fraudsters, though the Squad member defended she returned the donations after the scandal broke.\n\nShe’s been closely linked to at least two individuals from Minnesota’s Somalian community who’ve been charged in the fraud.\n\nOne is Salim Ahmed Said, the co-owner of Safari Restaurant, where Omar held her 2018 congressional victory party.\n\nSaid was found guilty in August of stealing more than $12 million for serving 3.9 million “phantom” meals during the COVID-19 pandemic, blowing much of the money on a $2 million Minneapolis mansion and a $9,000-a-month shopping habit at Nordstrom, according to prosecutors.\n\nAs the scam was underway in 2020, Omar even appeared on video at Minneapolis’ Safari Restaurant to praise the program.\n\n“Every day Safari provides 2,300 meals to children and their families,” she boasted in Somali in the video while being filmed handing trays of food in a parking lot with her pandemic-era facemask pulled down below her nose.\n\nThe other individual, Guhaad Hashi Said, worked on Omar’s campaign in 2018 and 2020, and pleaded guilty in August to running a fake food site called Advance Youth Athletic Development, where he falsely claimed to serve 5,000 meals a day and pocketed $3.2 million out of the food program. \n\nOn Capitol Hill last week, Omar said she had no regrets about introducing the MEALS Act. \n\n“Absolutely not, it did help feed kids,” she told a reporter.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Omar’s communications director sent The Post a message saying the entire office was closed until Jan. 5 – without offering an alternative contact.\n\nMynett did not return The Post’s messages, and both his businesses’ numbers were not functional.\n\n“Does Ilhan Omar know these people? Are they from her wonderfully managed Home Country of Somalia?” President Trump posted on his Truth Social platform in September when the news of new charges first broke.\n\nMinnesota governor Tim Waltz – Kamala Harris’ former running mate – has also faced intense scrutiny for letting the scandal unfold under his watch.\n\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon wrote a letter calling for him to resign, and Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN) hinted at possible criminal charges.\n\n“Minnesota, under Governor Waltz, is a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity,” Trump said last month. “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great state, and billions of dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from.”\n\nThe Treasury and Justice Department has already launched an investigation into the alleged money laundering.","summary":"The Jimmy Choo wearing socialist introduced the MEALS Act to Congress in 2020, relaxing oversight of children's meals programs and paving the way for the scheme the feds said could top $9 billion.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/27/us-news/ilhan-omars-hubbys-30m-firm-quietly-scrubs-names-from-website-as-squad-member-faces-mounting-questions-on-sudden-wealth-amid-minnesota-welfare-fraud/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/117887193.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/LI6D0KUw-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-27 14:18:07","author":"Gabrielle Fahmy,Geoff Earle","authors":["Gabrielle Fahmy","Geoff Earle"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.438},{"id":389448598,"title":"Elon Musk Calls Tim Walz a 'Crook' and Demands Prosecution Over £7bn Minnesota Fraud Scandal","text":"Tech billionaire Elon Musk has intensified his attacks on Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, branding him a 'crook' and calling for his prosecution over a sprawling fraud scandal that federal prosecutors say could involve up to £7 billion ($9 billion) in stolen taxpayer funds.The Tesla and SpaceX CEO shared a post on X calling to prosecute Walz in response to investigative content posted by YouTuber Nick Shirley, whose videos have exposed alleged fraud schemes across Minnesota's welfare and Medicaid programmes.'Tim Walz is a crook', Musk wrote on Sunday.A Minnesota Department of Human Services staff account replied: '[Walz] absolutely is hiding fraud AND has retaliated & destroyed the lives of many whistleblowers'.Federal Prosecutors Call Fraud 'Industrial-Scale''The fraud is not small. It isn't isolated. The magnitude cannot be overstated', First Assistant US Attorney Joe Thompson said during a press conference on 18 December. 'What we see in Minnesota is not a handful of bad actors committing crimes. It's a staggering, industrial-scale fraud.'Federal authorities have uncovered alleged schemes spanning 14 high-risk programmes, including housing assistance, autism therapy, and disability supports. Thompson had earlier suggested that half or more of the £14 billion ($18 billion) billed since 2018 could be fraudulent.The investigations grew from the £195 million ($250 million) Feeding Our Future scandal. Autism-related Medicaid claims surged from £65 million ($83 million) in 2021 to £267 million ($342 million) in 2024.House Republicans Join Calls for AccountabilityHouse Oversight Committee (HOC) Chairman James Comer told reporters that the 'walls are caving in' on Walz. 'The key to a good congressional investigation is having whistleblowers. And, fortunately for us, we have some state employees who have bravely stepped forward.'US House Majority Whip Tom Emmer echoed Musk's criticism on X. 'There's no way the Walz administration didn't know about the billions being stolen in fraud', the Minnesota Republican wrote.

Wiles' strategy would be a bold departure from that midterm playbook.\n\nAnd it means the party will embrace a full-throttle defense of the policies and platforms that led to the President's dominating performance in 2024 when he easily dispatched Kamala Harris, whom Democrats and a compliant media heavily promoted as the second coming of Obama.\n\n\"Typically, in the midterms, it's not about who's sitting at the White House. You localize the election, and you keep the federal officials out of it,\" Wiles said in an appearance on \"The Mom View\" podcast. \"We're actually going to turn that on its head and put him on the ballot.\"\n\n\"Because so many of those low propensity voters are Trump voters,\" she added, noting that some results in 2025 show \"what happens when he’s not on the ballot and not active.\"\n\n\"He's going to campaign like it's 2024 again…He's a difference maker, and he's certainly a turnout machine.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Dems' Theory on Kamala’s Loss Goes Up in Smoke: Shocking Analysis Shows Trump Could Have Won by Even More\n\n'We Don't Dispute' It: Georgia 315k Vote Bombshell Blows a Big Hole in 2020's 'Most Secure Election' Lie\n\nWiles said she hasn't quite broken the news to President Trump that he'll be touring the country on the campaign trail yet, but we doubt he'll be adamantly opposed to holding rallies and dancing to the YMCA for candidates who support him.\n\nThis will be welcome news for conservatives who remember the frustration of past midterms. In 2018, during Trump's first term, Republicans lost control of the House in a significant setback, flipping dozens of seats to Democrats despite holding the Senate.\n\nFast forward to 2022, when the much-hyped \"red wave\" never materialized. Republicans narrowly took the House but failed to deliver the sweeping victories expected under a deeply unpopular Biden administration. Turnout among the MAGA base was lackluster in several battlegrounds, allowing Democrats to overperform.\n\nRepublicans opposed to the new strategy might want to look at their own record before chiming in. President Trump has been working tirelessly since re-entering the Oval Office. The GOP-led Congress? Not so much.\n\nThat might not be the best record to run on.\n\nA study of the 2024 presidential election revealed that, contrary to the media narrative, Harris was not a victim of low turnout. In fact, GOP turnout was strong thanks to Trump being on the ballot, and the study suggested that had he driven more voters to the polls, his already big victory would have been even larger.\n\nDavid Shor, a Democrat data scientist and political consultant renowned for analyzing political polls, refuted the theory that voter turnout would have helped give Kamala the edge.\n\n\"The reality is if all registered voters had turned out, then Donald Trump would’ve won the popular vote by 5 points [instead of the roughly 1.6+ points],\" he explained. \n\n\"So, I think that a 'we need to turn up the temperature and mobilize everyone' strategy would’ve made things worse.\"\n\nAnd there you have it. Republicans, as Wiles is suggesting, \"need to turn up the temperature and mobilize everyone.\" Who better to do that than the most consequential political figure of the modern era? The man who swept the battleground states where GOP candidates in 2022 struggled.\n\nBy nationalizing the midterms and putting Trump front and center—with rallies, endorsements, and his massive war chest—Republicans can drive turnout among the working-class voters who propelled him to victory last year.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy RedState's conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

Republicans sought to cement President Donald Trump’s gains, while Democrats, fearing they could lose an increasingly disaffected segment of the electorate for a generation, launched a series of initiatives to prevent that. Ahead of next year’s midterms, some Democrats say the momentum is shifting. High-profile Democrats running in last month’s elections — Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Zohran Mamdani in New York City — improved on the party’s poor performance among young men one year before. Some 2028 Democratic presidential contenders launched policy initiatives aimed at men and boys. And in Trump’s first year in office, many young men say they feel a continued economic and social malaise, cutting into his support with that key group. “I never want to hear again that the Democratic Party has a problem with young men,” Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin told reporters after the November elections. While some Democrats are taking an early victory lap, members of both parties say the fight is far from over. “There’s some bed-wetting going on amongst some folks who are like, ‘Well, Trump’s numbers have slipped with all these groups that he won big with last year,’” said a senior Republican strategist, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the matter. “That’s just shortsighted. ... The Republican ecosystem is just a little bit stronger in this space.” In addition, multiple Democrats said that while they’ve been encouraged by the progress the party has made, there remains a level of discomfort among some party leaders in speaking to those issues. At last month’s Symposium on Young American Men, a conference put on by The Lafayette Company, a conservative communications firm, to discuss crises facing the demographic, Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., said some in the party still have a fear of being “canceled” for homing in on the subject. “It’s OK to reach out to men,” Gallego said. “Talk to men. Talk about men being men.” Republicans, meanwhile, plan to hammer Democrats ahead of the midterms as out of touch with the concerns of young men while projecting improved economic standing for them in the new year, pointing to tax provisions in Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” including some about tipped wages. The senior Republican strategist said the midterms will be decided by voters’ attitudes on Trump and the economy, predicting sentiment will improve as Trump’s agenda fully sets in. “There’s a lot of folks who feel that they are not where they should be, they’re falling behind,” this person said. “There’s a general unsettlement. Young men are especially there when you look at job prospects, AI, there’s uncertainty in general. And you add in the fact that you can’t buy a house, you can’t find a girlfriend. ... A lot of folks look to Trump for solutions.” The fight could define several critical midterm races, with Democrats hoping to build on their 2025 gains while Republicans still work to figure out how to get inconsistent voters to turn out without the president at the top of the ticket. A senior GOP Senate aide said that “to the extent” Republicans are pondering how to get disaffected young men back to the polls next fall, “they’re just hoping Trump does it” for them. While it’s difficult to measure how Trump’s standing among young men has ebbed, this month’s Yale Youth Poll found his gains with young voters last year have largely been wiped out this year. The survey found that just 34% of voters ages 18 to 22 approved of Trump, in addition to 32% of voters ages 23 to 29. Last year, Trump won 42% of those under 30, a traditionally left-wing electorate that shifted substantially rightward from 2020. Economic sentiment appeared to be the biggest factor in the shift. Mamdani, Spanberger and Sherrill all focused on affordability in their campaigns and not only improved among young men over 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris but were also able to win over 7% to 9% of Trump voters in their elections, per NBC News exit polls. Youth unemployment — for those ages 16 to 24 — was at 10.8% in July, rising year over year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate in November for U.S. residents ages 20 to 24 hit 8.3% in November, BLS data showed, down from 9.2% in September but still the highest since 2021. And this spring’s Harvard Youth Poll found that roughly 4 in 10 of those under 30 were “barely getting by” financially. Christian G., 25, an independent from Clifton, New Jersey, said it was continued disappointment with the economy that had him voting for Sherrill after having backed Trump. “I feel like I expected certain things to be improved or certain things to become more affordable, and it did the exact opposite,” he said in a recent focus group observed by NBC News and produced by Syracuse University and the research firms Engagious and Sago, adding: “I would say for me it is kind of a testament to how, I guess, trust was lost over the year. Whereas I voted for him back in ’24, now, a year later, I’m feeling let down. I wanted to be a little more logical in my approach and vote for someone who I thought would benefit me more.” It’s not what many Democratic leaders figured when they entered the year trying to tackle Republicans’ advantage among young men — an edge they believed was due to the “manosphere,” a universe of apolitical to explicitly right-wing podcasters and streamers who embraced Trump in last year’s election. Some Democrats urged party leaders to break into that space, while others were willing to spend millions to fund their own male-friendly content platform. Thinking about the project to essentially create a left-wing Joe Rogan, Virginia state Del. Josh Thomas, a Democrat who spoke at last month’s Symposium on Young American Men, laughed. “I’m laughing because it ain’t that hard if you’re being yourself,” he said, adding: “And so I don’t know if it’s a good use of donor funds to try and re-create a new ecosystem or shoehorn people into an existing ecosystem. But we have ... very earnest and sincere Democratic leaders who are men who can speak authentically about what it means to be a man at an earlier time and also what it means to be a man today.” One Democratic man who found success in such spaces was Mamdani, who won young men by roughly 40 points over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo last month. He has made a series of high-profile podcast appearances this year, including on “Flagrant,” a prominent comedy program Trump appeared on last year, and “The Adam Friedland Show.” In an interview, Mamdani said he was struck by how many New Yorkers he engaged with came across him only through his appearances on shows like “Flagrant.” He said a critical lesson for Democrats “is to stop treating young people and young men with the condescension that we often see and hear in our politics.” “What I found time and time again is that affordability was not something that needed any translation in young people’s lives, that this was something that was the difference between whether or not they could move out of their parents’ apartment and live on their own or not,” said Mamdani, the 34-year-old avowed democratic socialist. “There’s oftentimes even this attempt at trying to speak to young people, especially young men, slowly, through the prism of friends or memes, when you can, in fact, speak directly to them and to their problems.” Mamdani also connected issues around the cost of living with male loneliness and alienation. “Part of this story that we are telling is that the crisis of cost has also denied so many people the engagement with their own city and the sense of themselves as being someone who does more than just exist between work and home,” he said. Mamdani, whose campaign held high-profile free events, including a soccer tournament and a scavenger hunt, said he’s thinking of how to spur more free or low-cost events in the city that young people can take part in. Elsewhere, Democrats across the spectrum are coming forth with ideas to address an array of male-centric issues. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore recently announced an initiative to hire more male teachers, while California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said Democrats had “walked away” from men’s and boys’ issues, signed executive orders this year to address male suicide and launch a “California Men’s Service Challenge.” In an interview, Thomas noted that he authored legislation to create Virginia’s first governor’s advisory board on boys’ and men’s issues. “I think men have seen ... there’s been a different focus in the Democratic Party that maybe didn’t exist in October of last year,” he said. Yet voters often feel differently about state and local elections than they do about national ones. Alex Lieberman of Brooklyn, New York, said that even though he backed Mamdani in November, he would vote for Trump for a third time if he could. (Without Trump on the ballot, Lieberman said, he would back whoever the more populist option is.) “I think he has fulfilled his campaign promises,” Lieberman, who is in his 20s and said he was inspired to vote for Mamdani in part because of his focus on affordability and small-business issues, said of Trump. “And I think that everything that people are not happy with, I just don’t, frankly, understand, because it was exactly what it was like in the first term.” In office, Trump hasn’t made such explicit appeals to young men, though allies have said his agenda — particularly on the economy, diversity and immigration — has them in mind. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., told NBC News at the Symposium on Young American Men that Trump has sought to bolster the standing of young men, “but I haven’t heard him speak specifically ... about young men much, other than celebrating excellence and achievement, celebrating hard work.” Lankford said he has heard the conversation around issues affecting young men shift over the past year, saying he no longer hears much, if any, discussion of “toxic masculinity,” a concept that conservatives have criticized for years as part of broader left-wing excess. Similarly, the right has taken sharper aim this year at diversity initiatives, claiming they hamper the prospects of younger white men. To maintain their strength with young men, a longtime pro-Trump operative said, Republicans will capitalize on diversity policies they feel a future Democratic presidential nominee will embrace. “I don’t think we’ve lost them,” this person said of young men. “I still think our party will be the one that has a more appealing vision. Will they turn out in the midterms for random Republicans? Maybe not. Were they turning out for the midterms before? No. Really, what we’re talking about is will they be there in ’28.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/fight-young-men-2026-midterm-elections-rcna249513","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251224-zohran-mamdani-vl-1014p-9b7ea7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 11:00:00","author":"Allan Smith","authors":["Allan Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.046},{"id":389398104,"title":"Five Senate Seats Most Likely to Flip from Republicans to Democrats in 2026","text":"Democrats are hoping to overcome a challenging map and win control of the Senate in November as polls suggest several races in states won by President Donald Trump could become competitive. In a statement to Newsweek, NRSC Regional Press Secretary Nick Puglia expressed confidence in Republicans’ chances, saying that Democrats are “the most unpopular they’ve ever been.” Why It Matters Roughly one-third of Senate seats are up for re-election in November. Democrats are optimistic about their chances of winning control of the House—but their math in the Senate is tougher. Republicans hold 53 seats, and Democrats hold 47 seats, so they must pick up four seats to win a majority. They will have to win more conservative states to win a majority. What to Know The seats held by GOP Senator Susan Collins in Maine, a state Trump has lost in each of his three runs, and retiring Senator Thom Tillis in North Carolina, which Trump won by only about 3 points last November, are viewed as Democrats’ best pickup opportunities. But no other Republicans representing single-digit Trump or states won by former Vice President Kamala Harris are up for reelection. This means Democrats must win more solidly conservative territory to win a majority. Democrats are also defending two seats in states won by Trump—the seats in Georgia held by Senator Jon Ossoff and Michigan by retiring Senator Gary Peters. Stephen Farnsworth, political science professor at the University of Mary Washington, told Newsweek the Senate “seems more likely to remain in Republican hands than not.” “Democrats have good pickup opportunities in NC and ME—and perhaps an outside chance in Ohio. Even so, a very good election night for Democrats in the upper chamber would only bring the Senate to 50-50, with a Republican VP serving as the tie-breaker,” he said. Trump’s messaging on the economy will be a key question for Republicans. “Voters will not be distracted from poor economic performance. Republicans need voters to feel better about their financial situation - and soon—if they hope to retain control of the House,” he said. The Cook Political Report lists five Republican-held seats as potentially being competitive. Maine and North Carolina are viewed as toss-ups, Ohio is viewed as Leans Republican, and Iowa and Texas are both viewed as Likely Republican. Here is a look at the GOP-held seats considered the most competitive ahead of the midterms. Maine In Maine, Collins has won in tough environments before—most recently in 2020, when she won despite former President Joe Biden carrying the state by 9 points. But 2026 may prove to be her toughest race yet. Despite the nation drifting 6 points rightward in 2024, Maine barely budged, backing Harris by 7 points. It’s not clear who she will face in the general election, as Democrats in Maine are set to decide a competitive primary between Governor Janet Mills and Graham Platner. Mills has won by large margins in her elections, so many Democrats view her as the strongest candidate to defeat Collins. But more progressive Democrats believe Platner may have a more inspiring message and represent a new generation of leadership. He has faced backlash for old social media posts, but it’s not clear how that has reshaped the campaign. The most recent poll of the race shows a close election. The Pan Atlantic Research poll of 820 likely voters from November 29-December 7, 2025, showed Collins and Mills in a tie (43 percent each), while Platner led Collins by a single point (43 percent to 42 percent). A poll from the Maine People’s Research Center gave Collins an advantage over Mills (46 percent to 42 percent), but Platner a lead over Collins in the hypothetical matchup (45 percent to 41 percent). It surveyed 783 likely voters from October 26-29, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. North Carolina North Carolina represents Democrats’ other prime target. It gave Trump a 3-point victory last November and remains one of the most evenly divided battlegrounds across the country. Democrats haven’t won a Senate race in the Tar Heel State since 2008, but the party believes its candidate, former Governor Roy Cooper, may be poised to change that next year. Republicans have coalesced around Michael Whatley, the former Republican National Committee chair who has received support from Trump. Early polling gives Cooper an advantage. A Harper Polling survey showed Cooper up 8 points over Whatley (47 percent to 39 percent). It surveyed 600 likely voters from November 9-10, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Meanwhile, a Change Research survey from September showed Cooper with a 7-point lead (48 percent to 41 percent). It surveyed 855 likely voters from September 2-8, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. Ohio Ohio, once a premier battleground state, has steadily become more Republican over the past decade, backing Trump in each of his presidential races. But Democrats view the race to finish out Vice President JD Vance’s full term as potentially being competitive. Senator Jon Husted, appointed to the seat after Trump and Vance’s victory last November, is viewed as the likely Republican nominee. Former Senator Sherrod Brown, who lost reelection last November, is seen as the frontrunner on the Democratic side. Ohio backed Trump by about 11 points last November. The most recent polls point to a close race. An Emerson College poll of 850 registered voters from December 6-8, 2025, showed Husted up three points (49 percent to 46 percent), but a Bowling Green State University survey of 800 registered voters from October 2-14, 2025, had Brown up by a single point (49 percent to 48 percent). Texas Democrats have been eyeing Texas as an emerging swing state for years—but that dream hasn’t come to fruition. They are hoping the 2026 midterms could be another opportunity to make inroads with the largest red state in the nation. How competitive the race could become may depend on the primary. On the Republican side, Senator John Cornyn is facing a challenge from Attorney General Ken Paxton and Representative Wesley Hunt. Cornyn is viewed as a stronger incumbent, and polls suggest he would be in a stronger position than his rivals. The Democratic primary pits Representative Jasmine Crockett against state legislator James Talarico. So far, polling gives Crockett, who has risen to national prominence, an advantage. A University of Houston/Texas Southern University poll from earlier in the fall showed Cornyn with a 6-point lead over Crockett (50 percent to 44 percent) and a three-point lead over Talarico (48 percent to 45 percent). Paxton led Crockett by 2 points (49 percent to 47 percent) and Talarico by 3 points (49 percent to 46 percent). Meanwhile, Hunt led Crockett by five points (50 percent to 45 percent) and Talarico by 6 points (50 percent to 44 percent). The poll surveyed 1,650 registered voters from September 19 to October 1, 2025. Iowa Democrats are also hoping to make the Iowa Senate competitive, vacated by GOP Senator Joni Ernst. Like Ohio, it has shifted away from Democrats during the Trump era, backing him by 13 points last November. Republican candidates include Representative Ashley Hinson and former state Senator Jim Carlin; Hinson has been endorsed by Trump. Democratic candidates include state Senator Zach Wahls, state Representative Josh Turek and KNIA market director Nathan Sage. There have been no polls on the race since Ernst said she wasn’t running. What People Are Saying NRSC Regional Press Secretary Nick Puglia told Newsweek: “Democrats are the most unpopular they’ve ever been with the American people. Radical leftists like Jon Ossoff, Janet Mills and Roy Cooper think the answer is more progressive policies like men in women’s sports and higher taxes. Good luck with that.” Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson Maeve Coyle wrote in an October statement: “This week, as open enrollment begins, millions of Americans across the country are receiving notices that their health care premiums have skyrocketed – in many cases doubling or more – because Senate Republicans continue refusing to address the health care crisis that they created. These health care price hikes will hurt working families and will be an electoral albatross for every Republican Senator and candidate who created this crisis, and voters will hold them accountable in 2026.” What Happens Next Candidates will spend the coming months making their cases to voters in hopes of winning a majority of support in key races. Issues like Trump’s approval rating and the economy are likely to loom over the midterms.","summary":"Democrats are hoping to win back control of the Senate in 2026 despite a challenging map.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/five-senate-seats-most-likely-to-flip-from-republicans-to-democrats-in-2026-11268917","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TK-Senate-Seats-Most-Likely-to-Flip-from-Republicans-to-Democrats-in-2026-1.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-27 09:00:00","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.013},{"id":389346608,"title":"'Where’s Joe?' Why Biden's Christmas Family Photo Has Gone Viral For All The Wrong Reasons","text":"A picture is worth a thousand words, and former United States President Joe Biden must have been reminded of the timeless phrase after his Christmas Eve family photo blew up on social media—not for all the right reasons.\nIn the photograph shared on X, Biden stands at the back of the group, partly obscured by his wife Jill Biden, while other family members, including his son Hunter Biden, occupy more prominent positions in the frame. The former president’s daughter Ashley, Hunter’s wife Melissa Cohen and two other grandchildren are also seen in the family photo.\n\nWishing you a peaceful and joyful Christmas Eve filled with love. pic.twitter.com/OB5GouvxTJ\n— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) December 25, 2025\n\nDespite Biden’s caption wishing followers a “peaceful and joyful Christmas Eve”, many users quickly zeroed in on the former president’s placement, leading to a flurry of reactions online. Users on X and other platforms joked that Biden was “hidden” or “buried” in his own family photo, questioning why he appeared almost invisible behind family. Some even suggested the image looked like a deliberate snub or a symbolic sign of diminished stature.\n“I think it’s disrespectful to put the eldest family member in the back of a photo taken for the former president’s social media,” a user wrote.\nSome questioned Hunter’s placement in the picture, with a user saying: “Hunter is the alpha now.”\n“Ouch,” an X user commented. “Way to shove the family namesake to the back, cover part of his face, then post it to his social media account.”\nSeveral commenters also pointed to Biden’s recent health challenges, including treatment for prostate cancer, as context for their reactions, though others defended the family and offered warm holiday wishes.\n“Wishing you a peaceful Christmas Eve too, Mr President. Let’s hope the spirit of goodwill extends into the new year and helps bridge some of the divides we’ve seen. The image is a nice reminder of simpler times,” a user wrote.\nSince stepping away from the 2024 presidential race, Joe Biden has largely receded from the public and political spotlight.\nDuring his time in office, however, Biden frequently drew attention for a series of high-profile verbal slips and faltering debate performances. These included mistakenly referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as “President Putin,” confusing then Vice President Kamala Harris with Donald Trump, and misnaming Defence Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III during a public address.\nEarlier this month, Biden again stumbled over his words while delivering a speech, failing to clearly say the name of the country he once led. While criticising what he described as “the many crises caused by this administration,” he misspoke, saying, “We’re the United States of Amerigotit… That’s who we are.

During a discussion on “Kudlow,” guest host David Asman asked why prominent left-wing billionaires have not stepped in to help stabilize the DNC’s finances. Epstein said the silence from the donor class reflects a broader “vote of no confidence” in the Democratic Party.\n\n“I think what we’re seeing with the donor class right now is a lack of confidence, a vote of no confidence in the Democrats. And I think it stems back to a couple things,” Epstein told Asman. “The lie about Biden’s mental health, the incompetency of the Harris campaign, and the fact that all of the data shows that the Democratic Party is deeply out of touch on almost every single economic and social cultural issue.”\n\nEpstein said elite donors helped pull Democrats away from the political center. (RELATED: Democrats Ask For Money While Blaming Trump, GOP For Shutdown)\n\n“The irony here, David, is that the donor class is perhaps the most leftist class of the Democratic Party. They are the ones driving the Democratic Party to be out of touch. Now they are withholding their money because they don’t like the results of sort of the far-left drift,” Epstein added. “So I don’t really know where the Democrats go from here. I’ve argued for a Sister Souljah moment, but I don’t think a lot of people are listening to that.”\n\nThe DNC’s debt problems are not new, as the committee entered the midterm cycle months ago at a clear financial disadvantage, weighed down by lingering debt from former Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2024 presidential campaign and weak donor enthusiasm. At the time, the Republican National Committee reported raising $10.7 million in September with roughly $86 million in cash on hand, while the DNC brought in $10.3 million and held about $12 million in reserves.\n\nThe strain partly traces back to liabilities carried over from Harris’s failed presidential bid, which spent roughly $1.5 billion in just over three months.

She added that people should choose someone they enjoy spending time with in both everyday activities, like going to the grocery store or taking a walk, and in more formal settings.\n\nThe core of her commentary came when she described the concept of different types of relationships depending on a person’s current phase in life. Laughing alongside the host, she said, “Depending on what phase you’re in, maybe you’re going to choose that you want to have that kind of Friday night relationship or you want that Sunday morning relationship.” Harris acknowledged that sometimes the two align—and sometimes they do not. She added, “Sometimes you can get both, and sometimes it’s oil and water.”\n\nContinuing, Harris urged people to be honest about the kind of relationship they’re in and not try to force it into something else, stating, “The first step is to be honest about what you’re in. And not try and make it something that it’s not because that usually doesn’t work out so well.” She added, “Be in those phases where you are having fun. Be in those phases where you have a sense of ‘I just want something more.’”\n\nHarris made the remarks during an appearance on the Rich Little Brokegirls podcast, where she was promoting her new memoir, 107 Days. The interview was part of a broader book tour, which she has focused on instead of addressing questions about a potential 2028 presidential campaign.","summary":"In a recent podcast appearance, former Vice President and failed presidential candidate Kamala Harris shared her dating advice for single women.\n\n\nThe post Kamala Harris Offers Young Women Dating Advice: ‘Friday Night or Sunday Morning Relationship’ appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/12/26/kamala-harris-offers-young-women-dating-advice-friday-night-or-sunday-morning-relationship/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/12/Kamala-Harris-on-Dating-640x335.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-26 22:59:58","author":"Jasmyn Jordan","authors":["Jasmyn Jordan"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.153},{"id":389306820,"title":"Trump tells The Post he’s not ready to embrace Somaliland independence — unlike pal Netanyahu","text":"WASHINGTON — President Trump told The Post that he won’t quickly follow Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in recognizing the independence of Somaliland — saying he has to “study” his longtime Mideast ally’s pitch on behalf of the breakaway republic.\n\nIsrael on Friday became the world’s first country to recognize Somaliland’s split from anarchic Somalia and Netanyahu vowed to deliver a message to Trump, with whom he is meeting Monday.\n\n“I’ll communicate to President Trump your willingness and desire to join the Abraham Accords,” Netanyahu told Somaliland President Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi in a video call celebrating the diplomatic breakthrough.\n\nBut Trump said that he wasn’t swayed and expects his talks with Netanyahu will prioritize the Gaza Strip, where Trump brokered an October cease-fire and now chairs a United Nations-approved Board of Peace to oversee implementation and reconstruction.\n\n“Just say, ‘No, comma, not at this —,'” Trump told The Post in a phone interview, before modifying his answer on recognizing Somaliland to: “Just say, ‘No.'”\n\n“Does anyone know what Somaliland is, really?” Trump asked aloud from his golf course in West Palm Beach.\n\nTrump sounded unimpressed by the Muslim-majority state offering to join the Abraham Accords — through which Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the UAE established relations with Israel — and equally unimpressed by Somaliland’s offer of land for a US naval base near the mouth of the Red Sea.\n\nAsked about Somaliland’s offer to the US of a military port, Trump dismissively replied, “Big deal.”\n\n“Everything is under study,” the president added.\n\n“We’ll study it.

Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who opposes autonomy for the northern region, declaring, ” As long as I’m in Congress, no one will take over the seas belonging to the nation of Somalia.”\n\nThe breakaway nation has strong relations with neighboring Ethiopia, but other countries such as Turkey advocate against its independence. \n\nTrump said in August that he was considering granting Somaliland recognition, saying at the time: “We’re looking into that right now.

Four outrageous stories from Trump’s first year back that you may have forgotten about","text":"In 2019, former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon told PBS’ Frontline program how President Donald Trump was engaged in a deliberate strategy to overwhelm the press and his critics by rolling out massive and controversial policy changes while distracting them with trolling to keep them from ever focusing on any one thing that could matter.\n\nHe described the tactic as “flooding the zone.”\n\n“Every day, we hit them with three things. They'll bite on one, and we'll get all of our stuff done, bang, bang, bang,” he said. \n\nNearly a year into Trump’s second term, their “flood the zone strategy” has been in full effect. \n\nHis administration has unveiled sweeping changes to how America’s government operates in ways that have had and will have dramatic effects on how everyday people live for years to come. But those changes have come in such rapid-fire succession that nearly 365 days after Trump was sworn in on a freezing January day last year, it’s hard to even begin to remember what he’s done.\n\nHere are some of the wildest stories from the White House in 2025: \n\nFive days after his swearing-in, Trump committed a Friday-night massacre of the independent inspectors general who root out waste, fraud and abuse within federal agencies and departments.\n\nThe late-night purge removed the inspectors general at nearly every Cabinet-level agency without warning and in violation of a longstanding law requiring the president to notify Congress of his intent to fire any such official 30 days before actually doing so.\n\nOnly the watchdogs at the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security were permitted to remain in their jobs. \n\nTrump, who fired a number of inspectors general during his first term in an effort to kneecap their ability to investigate wrongdoing by his appointees, defended the illegal move as “very common” while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to the first weekend golf outing of his second term.\n\n“I don’t know them … but some people thought that some were unfair or some were not doing their job. It’s a very standard thing to do,” he said.\n\nThe purge took out Senate-confirmed watchdogs at the departments of Defense, State, Transportation, Labor, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Energy, Commerce, Treasury and Agriculture, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, Small Business Administration and the Social Security Administration. The move allowed Trump fill the positions with loyalists. \n\nLess than a month in the White House, Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for an official visit. \n\nNetanyahu’s trip was his first appearance there in quite some time, as Trump’s predecessor, former president Joe Biden, had declined to invite the Israeli leader due to election-year sensitivities around Israel’s brutal campaign of bombing civilian targets in Gaza to retaliate for the October 7, 2023, terror attacks by Hamas.\n\nJust weeks earlier, the Biden and Trump teams had shared credit for what was billed at the time as a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal between Israel and Hamas, though the agreement quickly collapsed.\n\nBut as Netanyahu stood beside him in the East Room, Trump offered up another plan for the war-torn territory that sent Middle East experts’ heads spinning as the president claimed the U.S. would “take over” Gaza, displacing the 2.1 million Palestinians living there while the territory is rebuilt as “the Riviera of the Middle East.” \n\nThe president’s shocking proposal to put the Gaza Strip — territory that Israel has occupied since the end of the 1967 Six-Day War — under American control came at the start of a madcap marathon press conference in the East Room following a bilateral meeting with Netanyahu, the first foreign leader Trump has hosted since returning to the White House last month. \n\nHe claimed that “everybody” he had spoken to about the plan “loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent.”\n\n“I've studied this very closely over a lot of months, and I've seen it from every different angle, and it's a very, very dangerous place to be, and it's only going to get worse. And I think this is an idea that's gotten tremendous ... praise. And if the United States can help to bring stability and peace in the Middle East, we'll do that,” Trump added. \n\nHis comments drew widespread criticism around the world, with Saudi Arabia saying it “unequivocally rejected” the forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, and Hamas branding the idea “ridiculous and absurd.”\n\nThe White House walked back the idea less than a day later, and the president’s aborted plan was later superseded by the ceasefire agreement negotiated between Israel and Hamas with the aid of Egypt, Qatar and other regional powers in October. \n\nDuring his 2024 campaign against former Biden, and later former vice president Kamala Harris, Trump was fond of telling supporters that he would be their “retribution” if he was elected again.\n\nSince taking office, he’s made good on that promise in ways that critics say have strained the rule of law and undermined the independence of the Department of Justice. \n\nBut Trump took an unprecedented step on his “retribution” tour in April by ordering the Department of Justice to investigate one of his most prominent first-term critics — for anything that can be found to investigate. \n\nThe order singled out Miles Taylor, a veteran of multiple Republican administrations who served as chief of staff to then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly during the president’s first term. During that time, Taylor infamously penned an anonymous New York Times op-ed — and later a book — describing efforts by Trump administration personnel to shield the government from Trump’s worst instincts.\n\nWhite House Staff Secretary Will Scharf said at the time that the order stripped Taylor “of any active clearance that he has in light of his past activities involving classified information” even though Taylor’s writings weren’t alleged to have included anything classified at all.\n\n“It's also going to order the Department of Justice to investigate his activities, to see what else might come up in that context, given his egregious behavior during your previous administration,” Scharf added.\n\nThe same day, Trump signed a similar order directing a probe of Chris Krebs, the security expert who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency during his first term. Krebs had incurred Trump’s ire in the immediate wake of the 2020 election — which Trump lost to Joe Biden — by stating publicly that the election was the most secure in the country’s 250-year history. \n\nHe also said there was “no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised” during the 2020 election, directly contradicting Trump’s false claims of fraud. \n\nThat order further targeted Krebs’ employer, the cybersecurity firm SentinelOne, by ordering the stripping of security clearances “held by individuals at entities associated with Krebs, including SentinelOne, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.” \n\nEight months later, neither Taylor nor Krebs has been accused of any crime, but Trump has continued to escalate his campaign of revenge against critics and adversaries by ordering the Justice Department to prosecute ex-FBI director James Comey and New York State Attorney General Letitia James, among others.\n\nThose efforts have thus far been stymied by federal judges who dismissed a pair of indictments against both Comey and James on the grounds that the ex-White House official who Trump installed as a prosecutor in Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, had been unlawfully appointed. \n\nLess than a month after he swore to “preserve, protect and defend” the U.S. Constitution, Trump took to social media to push back against the myriad challenges to his blitzkrieg of executive actions and threats to federal agencies from the then-Elon Musk-ed Department of Government Efficiency by invoking a movie quote from a film about Napoleon, who justified his despotic regime as the will of the people of France.\n\nWriting on X and Truth Social on February 15, Trump said: “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.”\n\nTrump, whose efforts to gut federal funding, fire thousands of aid workers and unilaterally redefine the 14th Amendment had been swiftly blocked by federal courts across the country in the opening salvos of what has become a series of months-long legal battles, appeared to be lifting a line 1970 film Waterloo, in which actor Rod Steiger’s Napoleon states that he “did not ‘usurp’ the crown.”\n\n“I found it in the gutter, and I picked it up with my sword, and it was the people … who put it on my head,” he says. “He who saves a nation violates no law,” Steiger said.\n\nFour days later, Trump went even further by crowning himself “king” of his former home, New York City, after the Department of Transportation purported to order the withholding of federal funds to New York unless it nixed the congestion pricing plan that the Democratic-led city government implemented.\n\n“CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD,” he wrote February 19 on Truth Social. “Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING!”\n\nThe White House’s X account then shared his statement with a mock cover of Time magazine featuring a portrait of the president wearing a crown with the caption “long live the king.”\n\nThen-White House Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich also shared an AI-generated image of the president wearing a crown and regal cape.\n\nIn response, ​​New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority sued Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and federal transportation officials, arguing the Trump administration unlawfully and “precipitously — and for blatantly political reasons— purported to ‘terminate’ the program, as then-candidate Trump proclaimed he would do in his first week in office.”\n\nA federal judge later blocked the Trump administration from withholding funds in retaliation for the congestion pricing scheme, and the MTA’s lawsuit seeking to permanently enjoin the administration from doing so remains ongoing.","summary":"A selection of the craziest stories from Trump’s first year back in office","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-president-2025-white-house-drama-b2888565.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/17/22/42/GettyImages-2196824430.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mfdInaz9-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-26 18:06:55","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.01},{"id":389257712,"title":"Bari Weiss defends decision to pull 60 Minutes episode on El Salvador prison","text":"CBS News’ editor-in-chief, Bari Weiss, defended her decision to pull a 60 Minutes episode on allegations investigating a notorious prison in El Salvador, arguing that the network’s priority was to ensure its coverage was “comprehensive and fair”.\n\nIn the memo sent to staff on Christmas Eve, Weiss said news organizations needed to do more to win back the trust of the American public and vowed that “no amount of outrage” would “derail us”.\n\n“We are not out to score points with one side of the political spectrum or to win followers on social media,” according to the memo, signed by Weiss and other CBS News leadership and published in full by several media outlets. “We are out to inform the American public and to get the story right.”\n\nThe internal battle over the story exploded into public view after CBS announced the segment would not be a part of the show, despite extensive promotion. Weiss’s last-minute decision to hold the episode sparked outrage and charges of censorship amid Donald Trump’s second administration, though some conservative commentators generally aligned with the president have defended the move. In a private email sent to 60 Minutes correspondents that was subsequently made public, CBS correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi, who spent weeks reporting the episode, called the decision a “political one”.\n\nIn the memo to staff, Weiss acknowledged the uproar her decision had caused internally and externally – but she rejected the accusation that politics played a role in her determination to hold the segment.\n\n“Such editorial decisions can cause a firestorm, particularly on a slow news week,” Weiss wrote. “And the standards for fairness we are holding ourselves to, particularly on contentious subjects, will surely feel controversial to those used to doing things one way. But to fulfill our mission, it’s necessary.”\n\nWeiss has said she was concerned about the episode airing without a sufficient response from the Trump administration. But Alfonsi said it had been “screened five times” as well as cleared by CBS attorneys along with its standards and practices department. She also said her team had unsuccessfully requested comment from the White House, the US state department, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\n“If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient,” Alfonsi wrote.\n\nThe episode has since appeared online, after it was published by a streaming platform owned by Global TV, the network that has the rights to 60 Minutes in Canada. In it, Alfonsi visits the prison in El Salvador and interviews deportees who offered powerful testimony about torture and abuse inside the notorious prison where the Trump administration had sent more than 200 Venezuelan migrants from the US in what a federal judge recently ruled was a violation of their due process rights.\n\nCBS’s decision to hold the episode comes amid a widening feud between the Trump administration and 60 Minutes – one of journalism’s most venerated institutions known for hard-hitting investigations. During the 2024 election, Trump declined to sit for an interview with 60 Minutes, then sued the network over how the show handled an interview with his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris. In a highly controversial move, Paramount, the parent company of CBS, agreed to pay Trump $16m to settle the lawsuit.\n\nEarlier in December, Trump fumed on Truth Social that the network had treated him “far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,’ than they have ever treated me before”.\n\n“If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!” the Republican added. A week earlier, he assailed the show for an interview with his ally turned critic, the outgoing Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, whom he called a “very poorly prepared Traitor”, and said of parent company Paramount: “THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP.”\n\nWeiss’s management of CBS has come under sharp scrutiny since she was installed as CBS News’s editor-in-chief by Paramount’s CEO, David Ellison, the son of Larry Ellison, a Trump ally and donor who is one of the world’s richest people. Paramount also acquired Weiss’s Free Press, the conservative-friendly publication she founded after leaving the New York Times as a columnist, in a reported $150m deal.\n\nHer appointment was met with frustration and concern by CBS’s editorial staff while media watchdogs questioned Weiss’s qualifications to lead the storied news network and raised concerns about further media politicization. Weiss, who built a reputation as a provocative opinion writer and media operator, has no experience working in broadcast television.\n\nParamount is now waging an extraordinary hostile takeover bid to gain control of Warner Bros Discovery, which had reached a deal to sell its storied film and television properties to Netflix. Trump has made clear that he plans to be involved in the acquisition’s regulatory review process.","summary":"CBS News editor-in-chief argues in memo that network’s priority was ‘comprehensive and fair’ coverage\n\n\nWho is Bari Weiss, the new editor-in-chief of CBS News?\n\nCBS News’ editor-in-chief, Bari Weiss, defended her decision to pull a 60 Minutes episode on allegations investigating a notorious prison in El Salvador, arguing that the network’s priority was to ensure its coverage was “comprehensive and fair”.\n\nIn the memo sent to staff on Christmas Eve, Weiss said news organizations needed to do more to win back the trust of the American public and vowed that “no amount of outrage” would “derail us”.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/dec/26/bari-weiss-60-minutes-el-salvador-prison","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79e619dbbc8ce2d36af522eb582ae8c2985dd676/713_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-26 17:55:20","author":"Lauren Gambino","authors":["Lauren Gambino"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.254},{"id":389249566,"title":"Democrats and Republicans tied on economy heading into 2026, survey finds","text":"For Republicans, the findings serve as a bit of a wake-up call. The party has traditionally held the advantage in voters’ opinions on the handling of the economy, a matter that has remained at the forefront of voters’ minds for the last few election cycles. \n\nPresident Donald Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris made the economy a focal point of their campaigns, with the victorious president promising to lower costs on Day One and revitalize the economy through an “America First” agenda. \n\nBut polling suggests that voters are not pleased with the results they have seen so far from the GOP trifecta in Washington. In August, a Third Way survey found that Republicans held a substantial lead over Democrats in handling the economy, with 42% to 36% support. They held a slight lead over inflation and trailed Democrats by only two percentage points in handling the cost of living.\n\nThe August poll came out after congressional Republicans successfully passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and signed it into law, legislation that the GOP has hailed as the largest tax cut for Americans despite opposition over the drastic cuts to Medicaid. \n\nThe think tank found that nothing that occurred in the first six months of Trump’s second term on Capitol Hill and in the White House did much to alleviate voters’ concerns about the state of the country. However, many had eyes on how voters’ temperaments improved in the days and months following Trump’s signing the Big Beautiful Bill Act into law on July 4. \n\nSix months later, voters are trending toward Democrats on the economy after they were underwater in the think tank’s summer survey, and they hold an 11-point lead on the cost of living compared to the survey released in August. Much of that has come after Trump’s tariffs have affected key voting blocs, such as farmers and small business owners.\n\nBut that does not mean Democrats can take a large victory lap. The centrist think tank found that, while Democrats are holding slight leads on key economic matters, they are unable to match what is needed to have a resounding victory in 2026.\n\n“President Trump and congressional Republicans have ceded the advantage on these issues they held just one year ago,” Third Way wrote in its analysis. “The question is whether congressional Democrats can fully convince Americans that they will be focused on cost-of-living and not that scandal of the week.”\n\nSeveral Democrats have largely attributed their 2024 losses, including Trump’s defeat of Harris, to the party’s failure to address kitchen-table matters and instead focusing on social and cultural matters. A handful of lawmakers came out in the aftermath of last year’s election to blame their party’s messaging on the economy and criticize the emphasis put on matters such as abortion or the LGBTQ community. \n\nAffordability has proven to be a winning message for Democrats this year. In November, Democrats dominated the three top elections of the 2025 cycle, with victories in the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races and a historic win for Zohran Mamdani in New York City’s mayoral contest. \n\nDespite Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) and Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) favoring centrist agendas, and Mamdani turning heads with his democratic-socialist policies, all three candidates hammered hard on the economy and affordability to flip key areas and significantly outperform the GOP.\n\n“Democrats really never dominated on trust on the economy, what we’ve been able to do is fight it to a draw in periods that have been very good for us electorally,” Matt Bennett, Third Way’s EVP of public affairs, told Politico Playbook. “What we need to do is at least keep it close, and I think that’s where we are.”","summary":"Voter confidence in Democrats and Republicans regarding the handling of the economy is evenly split, according to recent polling, highlighting the challenge both parties face on a central matter ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. A survey released on Thursday from Third Way, a centrist-left think tank, found that both parties are tied at 38% [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/4362182/democrats-republicans-tied-voters-economy-2026-survey/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25198776044421.jpg?w=696","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-26 17:23:21","author":"Rachel Schilke","authors":["Rachel Schilke"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.294},{"id":389317962,"title":"Kamala '28 Makes Even A CNN Democrat Laugh!","text":"CNN News Central\n\nJOHN BERMAN: One curveball here, Meghan. I'm a little bit obsessed with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and his Twitter feed over the last six months. Because, look, he ran for president and did not do well, right? And I think a lot of people saw him as stiff, unapproachable, prickly. \n\nSo on social media the last several months, he's tweeting about music. He's tweeting about sports. He's offering sort of unplugged commentary. I don't know if you've had a chance to see it, But it's the kind of stuff that makes you think either this guy has no Fs left to give, or, he thinks I need to show a different side of myself if I'm going to have a future in politics. \n\n. . . Melik, who do you think Republicans fear the most? \n\nMELIK ABDUL: I think that Republicans, well, who they should fear the most, I would argue it's between Shapiro and Gavin Newsom. \n\nYou remember the Fox News debate between Gavin Newsom or Ron DeSantis? Gavin Newsom actually performed very well. And even though he's from California, he is very, he looks the part. He's very stately. And those types of things matter from an optics perspective. But also, Shapiro being from a battleground state. I think that that is something that we also have to watch. I don't think that Wes Moore, he's the governor of Maryland. No one cares about the governor of Maryland. I don't think Pritzker, he has a lot of money. It won't matter. \n\nI think that the two standouts will be Gavin Newsom, and Shapiro.\n\nAnd notably, who we're not talking about, Kamala Harris. \n\nBERMAN: Why aren't we talking about her, Meghan? [Abdul chuckles.]\n\nMEGHAN HAYS: [Nervous laughter] Uh, [Abdul laughs out loud] you know, it's interesting [more nervous laughter.] \n\nI just am not sure [Abdul having a ball, continues to chuckle] she, I don't know that she's going to run. I know she talks about leaving the door open, but I think running, you have to have a base. You have to be able to raise a lot of money, and I think there's a lot of people in the race, and I'm not sure that that's a path she wants to take again.\n\nBut, you know, again, there's probably going to be 20, 25 candidates. So, the water is warm.","summary":"For politicians, scandal and controversy can be bad. But becoming the object of ridicule can be even more devastating. So if Kamala Harris happens to read these words, we'd advise her NOT to watch CNN's 7 am Christmas Day hour. What she'd find under the tree would be something worse than a lump of coal. It'd be a steaming pile of . . . ridicule. \n\nIt's almost 2026, so why not a horse race segment on 2028 presidential contenders? After former Biden aide Meghan Hays and Republican strategist Melik Abdul named their favorites, Abdul observed: \n\n\n\"Notably, who we're not talking about: Kamala Harris.\"\n\n\nHost John Berman put it to Hays: \"Why aren't we talking about her, Meghan?\" \n\nAbdul was manifestly amused to see Hays thusly put on the spot, and even Berman couldn't suppress a grin. Hays proceeded to engage in an extended bout of nervous laughter. She questioned whether Harris would run, and was dubious about the existence of a Harris base or her ability to raise money.\n\nOn second thought, perhaps Kamala should v","url":"https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/mark-finkelstein/2025/12/26/kamala-28-makes-even-cnn-democrat-laugh","image":"https://cdn.newsbusters.org/styles/mobile_thumb_700x400_/s3/2025-12/Image69.jpg?itok=-CqmAx2K","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-26 17:12:00","author":"Mark Finkelstein","authors":["Mark Finkelstein"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.206},{"id":389263822,"title":"Singles turn to parents to help with dating apps","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nAmericas Newsroom December 26, 2025 04:06 \n\n Singles turn to parents to help with dating apps \n Project Soulmate co-founder Jennifer Zucher joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss a rising trend of single Americans turning to parents, family and friends to help with online dating and former Vice President Kamala Harris' advice on dating.\n Tags MEDIAMENTAL HEALTHSHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRAMERICA'S NEWSROOMV-VIDEOPERSONALITIES","summary":"Project Soulmate co-founder Jennifer Zucher joins &apos;America&apos;s Newsroom&apos; to discuss a rising trend of single Americans turning to parents, family and friends to help with online dating and former Vice President Kamala Harris&apos; advice on dating.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6386951132112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/3d6865fb-358b-4a7f-9aa3-de906c2043e2/1bd7e249-5cb8-4130-b20e-10cff423e19a/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-26 16:46:28","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.462},{"id":389346550,"title":"Holly Ramsay wears white as she and her family head to Bath ahead of her wedding to Adam Peaty - as his mother makes major U-turn on nuptials","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBlake Lively\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nU.K. Showbiz\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Dec 26th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichigan confirm Sherrone Moore replacement as Kyle Whittingham signs stunning $41m five-year deal\n\nFears for 19-year-old girl who vanished without a trace on Christmas Eve morning walk in Texas human trafficking hotspot\n\nFBI director Kash Patel announces permanent closure of J.

Things went downhill from there.\n'His mum was unhappy some of the family weren't there and confronted Gordon at the event.\n'Guests were made to sign non-disclosure agreements and hand in phones as the party was filmed.'\nIt was also revealed that Peaty's sister Bethany is the only member of his side who appears to have survived the bitter family fallout ahead of his wedding.\nThe hen-do snub sparked a huge response from the Peaty family, with Adam's aunt Louise blasting her nephew and his fiancée, Holly, in a series of Instagram comments.\nShe later claimed her sister Caroline wasn't invited to their wedding due to her appearance and not having the correct 'look'.\nBut one member of Peaty's family appears to have survived the feud, his sister Bethany - who did make the cut for Holly's picture-perfect Cotswolds hen do.\nIt's been reported that the real reason Bethany made the cut is that she 'fits in' to the Ramsays' glamorous world because 'she's blonde and pretty'.\nThere are claims that Bethany herself has had her head turned by the celebrity lifestyle, and has been asked to be one of Holly's bridesmaids.\nA friend close to the family told the publication: 'Bethany has always been very close to Adam and she is really taken with the celebrity lifestyle, she's had her head turned by all the glitz and glamour.\n'She was over the moon to be at the hen party, hanging out with Victoria Beckham and couldn't wait to tell all her friends about it. She really fits in with the glam world – she's blonde and very pretty.'\nEarlier this week it was claimed that Adam and Holly have reportedly sparked outrage after banning the public from a historic church for their wedding day.\nAccording to a new report, the ceremony itself will last just 90 minutes, yet the couple have allegedly block-booked the abbey so no other weddings can take place. \nTourists are expected to be denied entry, with security stationed around the site to prevent onlookers from taking photos.\nWhile hiring the abbey for a wedding typically costs around £2,500, the pair are thought to be paying several thousand more to secure exclusive use of the venue.\nAnd a picture of a notice posted at the abbey states it is 'closed all day for a wedding' on December 27. \nThe decision has not gone down well with locals, with one resident telling the publication: 'It seems rather selfish to be hiring the abbey for the whole day when your wedding service only lasts for an hour and a half or so.'\nThe Daily Mail has contacted Adam and Holly's representatives for comment. \nThe toxic family feud currently overshadowing Holly's imminent wedding to Adam was brushed aside on Monday evening as they dined with friends at her father's Mayfair restaurant.\nWith guests already arriving ahead of the ceremony, Ramsay dined out on prawns and caviar-coated sushi at Ramsay's Lucky Cat eatery, where a lavish meal from the 'chef's table' costs as much as £180 per person.\n\nView gallery\n\nAdam's mother Caroline has been barred from the service following an increasingly toxic and inconveniently public row that began in November (Adam and Holly seen together)\n\nView gallery\n\nAdam and Caroline are pictured together\n\nView gallery\n\nThey will marry at Bath Abbey on December 27 with the historic venue reportedly closed to the public for the day \nThe influencer was joined by Eve Winnington, the wife of Australian swimmer Elijah Winnington and a close friend of the couple.\nTaking to Instagram, Winnington shared a bathroom selfie with Ramsay alongside various images of her pre-wedding meal.\nThe bride-to-be appeared to favour a healthy £135 seafood platter on the night, with a selection of sushi, salted edamame and sweet and sour prawns adorning her table.\nPeaty stunned followers last month when it was revealed he had uninvited his relatives from his wedding, after his mother Caroline was not invited to Holly's swanky hen do.\nHolly RamsayAdam PeatyLondonGordon Ramsay\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHolly Ramsay wears white as she and her family head to Bath ahead of her wedding to Adam Peaty - as his mother makes major U-turn on nuptials\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNorth West shows off her extravagant diamond 'SHARK TEETH' grill made by celebrity jeweler\n\nAdele makes rare appearance with fiance Rich Paul and his three kids at Christmas party on Sunset Strip\n\nEXCLUSIVESoaking wet and naked Pamela Anderson chased me... but I wouldn't do what she desired: Famed photographer tells all \n\nBritney Spears REUNITES with one of her two sons for Christmas while the other celebrates with grandma Lynne and aunt Jamie Lynn\n\nMarvel star addresses wild rumor he had affair with Michelle Obama\n\nWhy we are crushing on retro!

It was completely jarring.\n\n\"It's dystopian, like something from a George Orwell novel.\"\n\nShowing the videos was suggested as amounting to a \"hate crime\" in one document seen by the Telegraph.\n\nThe politics lecturer was accused of causing his students, aged 17 and 18, \"emotional harm\".\n\nThe teacher launched a grievance procedure against the college but was effectively forced to resign from his £44,000-a-year post, receiving a £2,000 payoff.\n\nThe Free Speech Union said it believes laws initially intended to protect children from serious criminals were being twisted to go after adults with unfashionable opinions.\n\nThe teacher's case was an example of child safety protocols \"being weaponised to silence someone for political reasons\", the Union said.\n\nHenley College began its investigation in January 2025 following two complaints by students in his class which accused him of \"biased\" and \"off topic\" teaching.\n\nThe teacher was alleged to have shown videos of Donald Trump and his campaign \"propaganda\" and other videos which were \"unrelated\" to what was being taught.\n\nThis made a student \"feel quite uncomfortable\".\n\nThe teacher said: \"It was just terrifying; just mind-boggling. We were discussing the US election, Trump had just won and I showed a couple of videos from the Trump campaign.\n\n\"Next thing, I was accused of bias. One of the students said they were emotionally disturbed and claimed to have had nightmares.\"\n\nThe teacher, a practising Catholic, admits he is a Republican supporter but said he was \"not an extremist\" and that his views are mainstream.\n\nIn return, he said the college itself has a \"complete Left-wing bias\" and does not \"tolerate anything about Donald Trump\".\n\nOn the college's referral to the safeguarding Local Authority Designated Officer, a report said the teacher's views \"could be perceived as radical\" and told the school they should refer him to Prevent.\n\nThe report added that his behaviour \"could cause harm to a child\" and that there could be a \"criminal offence\" that could amount to a \"hate crime\" and that promoting his views could be considered \"radicalisation\".\n\nThe teacher said: \"I felt completely insulted at the suggestion I was a danger to children.\n\n\"It impacted my mental health. I had to see a counsellor. It upset my physical health. It was absolutely appalling. It really overwhelmed me.\"\n\nBy April he was accused of misconduct in a formal letter. His alleged offence was to have caused students \"emotional harm\" by showing them \"inappropriate content\" and videos and presenting \"potentially extremist views\" with a \"lack of balance\".\n\nIt cited complaints made by his students as evidence.\n\nOne of the videos in question was a music video, Daddy's Home by Roseanne Barr, a US comedian and Trump supporter, with Tom MacDonald, a Canadian known as the Maga Rapper.\n\nThe YouTube video was suggested to him by one of his pupils.\n\nThe teacher said he could not understand how showing this video could lead a student to be \"emotionally disturbed\".\n\nHe had been switched to teach politics in September 2024 amid staff shortages, previously teaching business studies at the college and receiving praise for his work.\n\nHe believes a group of students targeted him following this change.\n\nNow, the teacher is working part-time as a supply teacher while hunting for a full-time post.\n\nHe has extensive family ties to the US but insists his Republican views are not extremist.\n\nThere was also balance in the videos he showed, he claimed, adding that he had shown videos of Kamala Harris to the class too.\n\nFive Trump-related videos had been shown to the class before the complaint was made, he said.\n\nIn April, while being accused of misconduct, he wrote a letter to US vice president JD Vance complaining of \"communist-style silencing\" at his school but received no reply. He was unsure if Mr Vance ever received the letter.\n\nHe contacted the Free Speech Union, which claimed in his defence that he was a victim of \"bullying and harassment\".\n\nThey pointed out that the accusation he had shown a \"genocide video\" to children was false as the video was part of set teaching materials provided by the Holocaust Education Trust.\n\nHenley College said: \"The Henley College does not comment on individual allegations or ongoing investigations.\n\n\"We are committed to safeguarding the wellbeing of all our students and staff, and follow statutory safeguarding procedures in line with Keeping Children Safe in Education 2025.\n\n\"Allegations are handled with due care, in accordance with statutory guidance, with appropriate support provided to all involved.\"","summary":"Oxfordshire lecturer accused of causing students 'emotional harm' and forced to resign from £44,000-a-year post","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/uk-teacher-referred-to-counterterrorism-programme-after-showing-trump-videos-to-politics-class-b1264013.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/12/19/12/7c23bd6e411faa421a289627b40db52eY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzY2MjMwNTY4-2.81990300.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-26 15:31:15","author":"Sami Quadri","authors":["Sami Quadri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.622},{"id":389252910,"title":"Who thinks Republicans will suffer in the 2026 midterms? Republican members of Congress","text":"The midterm elections for Congress won’t take place until November, but already a record number of members have declared their intention not to run – a total of 43 in the House, plus 10 senators. Perhaps the most high-profile person to depart, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, announced her intention in November not just to retire but to resign from Congress entirely on Jan. 5 – a full year before her term was set to expire.\n\nThere are political dynamics that explain this rush to the exits, including frustrations with gridlock and President Donald Trump’s lackluster approval ratings, which could hurt Republicans at the ballot box.\n\nRather than get swept away by a prospective “blue wave” favoring Democrats – or possibly daunted by the monumental effort it would take to survive – many Republicans have decided to fold up the beach chair and head home before the wave crashes.\n\nAs of now, two dozen Republican House members have either resigned from the House or announced their intent to not run for reelection in 2026. With only two exceptions – Republicans in 2018 and 2020 – this is more departures from either party at this point in the election calendar than any other cycle over the past 20 years.\n\nThere is also growing concern within the House Republican caucus that Greene’s announcement is a canary in the coal mine and that multiple resignations will follow.\n\nAs a political scientist who studies Congress and politicians’ reelection strategies, I’m not surprised to see many House members leaving ahead of what’s shaping up to be a difficult midterm for the GOP. Still, the sheer numbers of people not running tells us something about broader dissatisfaction with Washington.\n\nWhy do members leave Congress?\n\nMany planned departures are true retirements involving older and more experienced members. \n\nFor example, 78-year-old Democratic congressman Jerry Nadler is retiring after 34 years, following mounting pressure from upstart challengers and a growing consensus among Democrats that it’s time for older politicians to step aside. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker who will turn 86 in March, is also retiring.\n\nSometimes, members of Congress depart for the same reasons other workers might leave any job. Like many Americans, members of Congress might find something more attractive elsewhere. Retiring members are attractive hires for lobbying firms and corporations, thanks to their insider knowledge and connections within the institution. These firms usually offer much higher salaries than members are used to in Congress, which may explain why more than half of all living former members are lobbyists of some kind.\n\nOther members remain ambitious for elective office and decide to use their position in Congress as a springboard for another position. Members of the House regularly retire to run for a Senate seat, such as, in this cycle, Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan. Others run for executive offices, including governor, such as Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina. \n\nBut some are leaving Congress due to growing frustration with the job and an inability to get things done. Specifically, many retiring members cite growing dysfunction within their own party, or in Congress as a whole, as the reason they’re moving on. \n\nIn a statement announcing his departure in June, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., mused that “between spending another six years navigating the political theater and partisan gridlock in Washington or spending that time with my family,” it was “not a hard choice” to leave the Senate.\n\nWhat’s unique about 2026?\n\nIn addition, there are a few other factors that can help explain why so many Republicans in particular are heading for the exits leading up to 2026.\n\nThe shifting of boundaries that has come with the mid-decade redistricting process in several states this year has scrambled members’ priorities. Unfamiliar districts can drive incumbents to early retirement by severing their connection with well-established constituencies. \n\nIn Texas, six Republicans and three Democrats – nearly a quarter of the state’s entire House delegation – are either retiring or running for other offices, due in part to that state’s new gerrymander for 2026.\n\nAll decisions about retirement and reelection are sifted through the filter of electoral and partisan considerations. A phenomenon called “thermostatic politics” predicts that parties currently in power, particularly in the White House, tend to face a backlash from voters in the following election. In other words, the president’s party nearly always loses seats in midterms.\n\nIn 2006 and 2018, for example, Republican members of Congress were weighed down by the reputations of unpopular Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Trump. Republicans had arguably even greater success in midterm elections during Barack Obama’s presidency.\n\nCurrently, 2026 looks like it will present a poor national environment for Republicans. Trump remains highly unpopular, according to polls, and Democrats are opening up a consistent lead in the “generic ballot” question, which asks respondents which party they intend to support in the 2026 midterms without reference to individual candidates. \n\nDemocrats have already been overperforming in special elections, as well as the general election in November in states such as New Jersey and Virginia, which held elections for governor. Democrats are on average running 13 points ahead of Kamala Harris’ performance in the 2024 election.\n\nAs a result, even Republicans in districts thought to be safe for their party may see themselves in enough potential danger to abandon the fight in advance.\n\nRetirement vs. resignation\n\nOne final, unique aspect of this election cycle with major consequences is not an electoral but an institutional one. \n\nHouse conservatives are quietly revolting against Speaker Mike Johnson’s leadership style. That members may be frustrated enough not just to retire but resign in advance, leaving their seats temporarily vacant, is a notable sign of dysfunction in the U.S. House. \n\nThis also could have a major impact on policy, given how slim the Republicans’ majority in the lower chamber is already. Whatever the outcome of the midterms in November, these departures clearly matter in Washington and offer important signals about the chaos in Congress.","summary":"The president’s party almost always loses seats in the midterms.

For example, a British professor was forced out of his job and compared to terrorists for showing his students videos of the U.S. president.\n\nOxfordshire’s Henley College forced out a teacher who showed clips of Donald Trump’s inauguration to his A-level students, per GB News. Accused of “emotional harm” and a possible “hate crime” by deranged child protection officials, the former teacher was reported to the UK Government's Prevent counter-terrorism program. \n\nIt is unclear how many students were supposedly traumatized, as the original complaint was apparently from one person. But the griping eventually got out of control, to the point of costing the teacher his job.\n\nFirst of all, Donald Trump is the most powerful world leader, so of course, in a politics course (which this was), it would make sense to watch videos of him. Secondly, even if we were to accept the preposterous premise that Trump is an evil dictator, just for the sake of argument, isn’t seeing photos and videos of dictators educational? Have these young people never watched a speech by Hitler or seen a photo of Stalin? Have they never been made to deal with photographic evidence of such atrocities as the Nazi death camps, Mao’s Great Famine, Pol Pot’s killing fields, or Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre?\n\nRelated: Trump Strikes ISIS in Nigeria, Shielding Persecuted Christians\n\nHow did we get to the point where UK college students, whose grandfathers won WWII, are distraught by merely listening to a leader with whom they disagree? The current prime minister of Britain is a globalist tyrant, but I’m not going to collapse in tears because I listened to a clip of him lying.\n\nGB News reported: \n\nThe lecturer, who is in his 50s, was effectively compelled to leave his £44,000-a-year position at Henley College following the referral, ultimately accepting a £2,000 settlement… Among the footage shown was Mr Trump's inauguration and five campaign-related videos. One clip was a music video called Daddy's Home featuring comedian Roseanne Barr and Canadian performer Tom MacDonald… The lecturer maintains he presented balanced content, including Kamala Harris videos, as part of lessons on politics and propaganda following the President's election victory.\n\n“They likened me to a terrorist. It was completely jarring. It's dystopian, like something from a George Orwell novel,” the sixth-form college teacher described his experience. He was “completely insulted at the suggestion I was a danger to children” and ended up going to counseling after losing his three-decade career.\n\n“We were discussing the US election, Trump had just won and I showed a couple of videos from the Trump campaign. Next thing, I was accused of bias,” the professor explained. “One of the students said they were emotionally disturbed and claimed to have had nightmares.”\n\nThe teacher, a Catholic with right-leaning views, had previously been lauded for his business classes. More recently, he started teaching politics, and unfortunately, across the West, politics is increasingly divisive.\n\nDocuments reviewed by The UK Telegraph show accusations that the teacher’s “behaviour could cause harm to a child” and “could be perceived as radical.”\n\nIt is no wonder a British WWII veteran recently wept on TV and said his country now is not the country for which he fought and for which so many died.\n\nEditor’s Note: Support and follow PJ Media’s coverage of key news this holiday season with our special Christmas sale.

This incident led to accusations of posing a risk to children and even resulted in a referral to a government counter-terrorism program.\n\nThe teacher, in his 50s, from Oxfordshire, shared with his students footage of Trump’s inauguration as part of a lesson on U.S. politics. However, this educational decision took an unexpected turn, as reported by the Telegraph.\n\nHenley College, a sixth-form institution in Henley-on-Thames with over 2,000 students, flagged the situation to the local child safeguarding authority. This prompted further action, resulting in the teacher being referred to Prevent, the UK government’s counter-terrorism initiative, as a matter of priority.\n\nChoosing to remain anonymous, the teacher expressed his shock to the Telegraph, stating, “They likened me to a terrorist. It was completely jarring.” He further described the ordeal as “dystopian, like something from a George Orwell novel,” highlighting the bewildering nature of the situation.\n\nThe teacher, who does not wish to be identified, told the Telegraph: ‘They likened me to a terrorist. It was completely jarring.\n\n‘It’s dystopian, like something from a George Orwell novel.’\n\nShowing the videos was suggested as amounting to a ‘hate crime’ in one document seen by the Telegraph. \n\nThe politics lecturer was accused of causing his students, aged 17 and 18, ’emotional harm’.\n\nThe teacher did not take the terrible allegations lying down however, launching a grievance procedure against the college.\n\nDespite this, he was still effectively forced to resign his £44,000-a-year post but received a £2,000 payoff.\n\n The Free Speech Union has said they believe the laws that were initially intended to protect children from murderers and rapists were being twisted to go after adults with unfashionable opinions.\n\nThe teacher’s case was an example of child safety protocols ‘being weaponised to silence someone for political reasons’, the Union said. \n\nHenley College began its investigations in January 2025 following two complaints by students in his class which accused him of ‘biased’ and ‘off topic’ teaching.\n\nThe teacher was alleged to have shown videos of Donald Trump and his campaign ‘propaganda’ and other videos which were ‘unrelated’ to what was being taught.\n\nThis made a student ‘feel quite uncomfortable’. \n\nThe teacher said: ‘It was just terrifying; just mind-boggling. We were discussing the US election, Trump had just won and I showed a couple of videos from the Trump campaign.\n\n‘Next thing, I was accused of bias. One of the students said they were emotionally disturbed and claimed to have had nightmares.’\n\nThe teacher, a practising Catholic, admits he is a Republican supporter but said he was ‘not an extremist’ and that his views are mainstream.\n\nIn return, he said the college itself has a ‘complete Left-wing bias’ and does not ‘tolerate anything about Donald Trump.’ \n\nOn the College’s referral to the safeguarding Local Authority Designated Officer (LADO), a report said the teacher’s views ‘could be perceived as radical’ and told the school they should refer him to the counter terrorism programme, Prevent.\n\nThe report added that his behaviour ‘could cause harm to a child’ and that there could be a ‘criminal offence’ that could amount to a ‘hate crime’ and that it was possible that promoting his views could be considered ‘radicalisation’.\n\nThe teacher said: ‘I felt completely insulted at the suggestion I was a danger to children.\n\n‘It impacted my mental health. I had to see a counsellor. It upset my physical health. It was absolutely appalling. It really overwhelmed me.’\n\nBy April he was accused of misconduct in a formal letter, his alleged offence was to have caused students ’emotional harm’ by showing them the ‘inappropriate content’ and videos and presenting ‘potentially extremist views’ with a ‘lack of balance’.\n\nIt cited complaints made by his students as evidence towards this. \n\nOne of the videos in question was a music video – Daddy’s Home by Roseanne Barr, a US comedian and Trump supporter, with Tom MacDonald, a Canadian known as the Maga Rapper.\n\nThe YouTube video was suggested to him by one of his pupils.\n\nThe teacher said he could not understand how showing this video could lead a student to be ’emotionally disturbed’. \n\nHe had been switched to teach politics in September 2024 amid staff shortages, previously teaching business studies at the college and receiving praise for his work.\n\nHe believes that a group of students targeted him since this take over.\n\nNow, the teacher is working part time as a supply teacher while hunting for a full-time post.\n\nHe has extensive family ties to the US but insists his Republican views are not extremist. \n\nThere was also a balance involved in the videos he was showing, he claimed contrary to their allegations, adding that he had shown videos of Kamala Harris to the class too.\n\nFive Trump related videos had been put on for the class before the complaint was made, he said. \n\nIn April, while he was being accused of misconduct, he wrote a letter to US vice president JD Vance, complaining of ‘communist-style silencing’ and his school but he received no reply, unsure if Mr Vance ever received the letter.\n\nLooking for further support, he contacted the Free Speech Union (FSU) who claimed in his defence that he was a victim of ‘bullying and harassment’.\n\nThey pointed out that the accusation that he had shown a ‘genocide video’ to children was bogus as the video was part of the set teaching materials provided by the Holocaust Education Trust.\n\nHenley College, said: ‘The Henley College does not comment on individual allegations or ongoing investigations.\n\n‘We are committed to safeguarding the wellbeing of all our students and staff, and follow statutory safeguarding procedures in line with Keeping Children Safe in Education 2025.\n\n‘Allegations are handled with due care, in accordance with statutory guidance, with appropriate support provided to all involved.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, a British teacher found himself entangled&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: UK Teacher Under Scrutiny: Counter-Terror Concerns Arise Over Trump Video in Classroom first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/uk-teacher-under-scrutiny-counter-terror-concerns-arise-over-trump-video-in-classroom/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Teacher-referred-to-counter-terror-programme-for-showing-Trump-videos.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-26 11:36:12","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.692},{"id":389163120,"title":"'Save Women's Sports' 2025 culture war timeline — the year the tides turned","text":"Someway, somehow, \"What is a woman?\" became one of this decade's defining cultural questions. And now, the nation is in a full-scale legislative war over the argument of whether males should be allowed to play women's and girls' sports. In 2025, that war escalated to historic heights. President Donald Trump returned to office and unleashed a volley of countermeasures to \"save women's sports.\" But many Democrats fought back, even as a majority of their base sided with Trump on the issue, per multiple polls. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM And on the front lines, activists, athletes, celebrities and journalists dug a deepening cultural divide. Emotional arguments made their way to school board meetings, live interviews, the chambers of the capitol building, and plenty of social media threads. January Weeks before Trump's inauguration, The New York Times put out a poll that found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports. \"Thinking about transgender female athletes — meaning athletes who were male at birth but who currently identify as female — do you think they should or should not be allowed to compete in women’s sports?\" the survey asked. Of the 2,128 people who participated, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. Of the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democrat, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women. HOW TRANSGENDERISM IN SPORTS SHIFTED THE 2024 ELECTION AND IGNITED A NATIONAL COUNTERCULTURE It was seen as one of the scapegoat issues highlighted for the Democrats' sweeping 2024 election defeat. One of the first bills the GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed in the new year was the \"Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act\" on Jan. 14, which sought to establish a national policy that only females could compete in women's and girls' sports at tax-payer-funded institutions. The bill passed the House with the support of two Democrat representatives. But party leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were hard nos, making unsubstantiated arguments that the bill would somehow enable sexual predators to give genital exams to children. No language in the bill included any mention of genital exams. The argument proved to alienate some Democrat voters, as the party saw waning public support and net losses in voter registration throughout the first month of the year. February Trump signed the \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order on Feb. 5 to tackle the issue, as the bill wouldn't reach the Senate for another month and a half. The NCAA complied the very next day, changing its policy to only allow biological females to compete in women's sports across the college sports landscape. But a handful of Democrat-controlled states did not comply, and instructed their public schools to continue following state policy that allows males in girls' sports. California, Maine, Minnesota and Illinois were among those states. Maine's defiance of the order allowed for almost immediate consequences, when a trans athlete won an indoor girls' track and field state championship. The incident ignited attention from the Trump administration and a heated political feud within the state. Maine lawmaker Laurel Libby was censured by the Democrat-controlled state legislature, and quickly became a symbol for conservative resistance in the state. Trump engaged in an in-person spat with Gov. Janet Mills during a bipartisan meeting of governors at the White House on Feb. 21 after threatening to cut funding from the state. There, Mills defied Trump's order to enforce the executive order right to his face, so the president threatened to cut federal funding to Maine right to her face. Trump's department of Education launched a Title IX investigation into the state later that day. But some Democrat-controlled states, including Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, complied with the order, passing reforms to their high school policies that complied to only allow females in girls' sports. March Senate Democrats united to block the \"Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act\" on March 3, via the filibuster. It left the floodgates open for states to defy Trump's executive order, and ensured thousands of American public schools continued to let males in girls' sports. Minnesota's legislature blocked a similar bill that would have protected girls' sports on the state level that same week. Later that week, at Trump's Joint Address to Congress, former girls' high school volleyball player Payton McNabb was a guest attendant, sitting right next to second lady Usha Vance. When Trump introduced McNabb and her story of suffering permanent brain damage when she was spiked in the face by a transgender opponent, only the GOP side of the room applauded her. The Democrats remained seated and silent. It was one of the many controversial points of etiquette exhibited by Democrats during the speech, alongside not applauding childhood cancer patient DJ Daniels, and Rep. Al Green, D-Tex., being escorted out for shouting and pointing his cane at Trump early in the speech. Just days after that, California Gov. Gavin Newsom threw a wrench into the debate when he, as one of the top figures within the Democrat party, hosted Charlie Kirk on his podcast and admitted to believing trans athletes in women's sports was \"deeply unfair.\" The comments pushed the conversation around the Meanwhile, the feud within Maine had only just begun. Libby filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn her censure on March 11. It would eventually go all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Trump administration made a series of unmet ultimatums with Maine's educational agencies. Behind the scenes, Maine's Department of Education was actively instructing schools not to follow Trump's executive order, as seen in public records obtained by Fox News Digital. By the end of the month, the state had been referred to the Department of Justice after noncompliance. The March exchanges between Trump and Maine even included a temporary funding freeze to the Maine University System, before the system proved that it hadn't been allowing males in women's sports, and wouldn't be going forward in compliance with the NCAA's new policy. But another institution got a much more consequential funding freeze. The University of Pennsylvania saw $175 million in federal funds frozen as part of an investigation into the state's handling of infamous trans swimmer Lia Thomas in 2022. It would be one big domino in reaching a historic resolution, which came later in the year. April On the first day of April, California's Democrat-controlled state legislature blocked two bills that would have banned males from girls' sports in the state. Every Democrat voted against it, with Assembly member Rick Chavez Zbur arguing that one of the bills \"is really reminiscent to me of what happened in Nazi Germany in the 1930s.\" Zbur said this while in the presence of a descendant of a holocaust survivor, who had to excuse herself from the chamber, according to GOP Assembly member Kate Sanchez. Newsom, who had admitted he didn't think males in girls' sports was fair the previous month, told reporters he \"didn't pay any attention\" to the bills the following day. \"Well, I didn't pay any attention to the committee yesterday. I was, literally, spent most of the day talking about LA fire recovery with our teams. And progress is being made there, by the way, but we're starting to run up into some of those ‘abundance’ conversations around permitting that's already starting to take shape, where most of my focus was yesterday,\" Newsom said. Meanwhile, April 1 also saw the neighboring state of Nevada's high school sports league take action to change its policies to ban trans athletes from high school sports, complying with Trump's On the second day of April, a budding hero was born when footage of fencer Stephanie Turner kneeling to protest a trans opponent at a USA Fencing event went viral. Turner was penalized and disqualified for refusing to face the trans athlete, and became a sudden martyr at the heart of the national \"save women's sports\" movement. Turner's protest became a global news story that ignited widespread backlash against USA Fencing and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC). It would eventually culminate in a federal investigation and hearing the following month. And on that same day, Trump's administration cut USDA funding directly to Maine, escalating the ongoing feud with the state. Just two days after that, the Department of Education and Department of Justice announced it would be jointly launching a Title IX task forced dedicated to protection of women's and girls' sports and private spaces across the country. The move sent a message that the Trump administration was doubling-down on addressing the issue, as states continued to defy the White House. On April 16, the Trump DOJ announced it was suing Maine for refusing to comply with Trump's executive order. Turner was present at the press conference to announce the lawsuit. The suit is set for its first hearing in January. Later that month, Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison went on the offensive, announcing he was suing Trump and the DOJ in order to protect the state's policies that allow males in girls' sports. May On May 7, the House Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE) brought the legislative war to the halls of congress with a hearing titled \"Unfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports.\" Marjorie Taylor Greene used the platform to hammer national governing bodies, specifically subpoenaing USA Fencing Board Chair Damien Lehfeldt. Lehfeldt, who had previously avoided voluntary testimony, was forced to defend his organization’s inclusion policies while sitting just feet away from fencer Stephanie Turner and former volleyball player Payton McNabb. The hearing put the growing partisan rift on display. Republicans tore into Lehfeldt's social media history and the organization's policy, while lauding McNabb and Turner as heroes for their activism. Democrats didn't direct any questions toward Turner or McNabb, and instead only made exchanges with other witnesses in defense of policies that enable trans inclusion, while also criticizing Trump on other issues. On May 20, the Supreme Court ruled in the legal battle between Libby and Maine's Democrat-controlled legislature. In a 7-2 emergency ruling, the High Court ordered the Maine House to immediately restore Libby’s voting rights, which had been stripped since February after she refused to issue a \"forced apology\" for a social media post identifying a transgender athlete. Libby, who had been silenced for over 80 days and missed hundreds of legislative votes, including on the state budget, hailed the decision in an interview with Fox News Digital as a \"civil rights win\" for both her constituents and for women’s sports advocates nationwide. On the high school front, the spring sports season saw multiple controversies garner national attention as trans athletes advanced to state championships in multiple girls' sports. In Minnesota, a trans softball pitcher garnered national notoriety amid dominant performances throughout the season and going into the playoffs, and prompted a lawsuit by three anonymous female players. In California, a trans track and field athlete's dominance caused postseason meets to devolve into political rallies. As the athlete progressed through the postseason, and close to a championship, the situation eventually caught Trump's attention. On May 27, Trump escalated the situation with a Truth Social, writing a \"transitioned male athlete\" was \"practically unbeatable\" and called the situation \"NOT FAIR, AND TOTALLY DEMEANING TO WOMEN AND GIRLS.\" He even wrote that he was \"ordering local authorities, if necessary, to not allow\" the athlete to compete and threatened to cut off California’s federal funding \"maybe permanently\" if the state didn't fall in line. Within hours of Trump’s post, the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) buckled under the pressure, announcing a desperate \"pilot entry process\" for the state championships. The new rule dictated that any \"biological female\" who narrowly missed qualifying because of a transgender competitor would be allowed to compete anyway. Furthermore, the CIF declared that if a trans athlete won a medal, the highest-finishing biological girl would also receive a gold medal. The rule change would result in shared podium finishes when the athlete ultimately won two gold medals and one silver at the state championships in Clovis on the final day of May, capping off a championship meet that featured multiple competing protests, an airplane banner that advocated for the protection of girls' sports, and even the arrest of a pro-trans protester for alleged assault of an opposing protester. June In the aftermath of the track championships, on June 2, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Trump DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, issued a hard June 9 deadline for every public school district in California to \"certify in writing\" that they would not follow the state’s gender identity rules. Meanwhile in Minnesota, the transgender pitcher was leading a dominant postseason run, securing their school's first-ever state tournament berth with a shutout victory in the sectional final. The trans athlete would go on to lead their team to the state title, and the online reaction would domino into a much larger cultural event. On June 9, Olympic gymnastics legend Simone Biles ignited a viral social media feud with Riley Gaines. Reacting to the Minnesota controversy and Gaines’s advocacy, Biles posted a scathing message on X, calling Gaines \"truly sick\" and suggesting she \"bully someone your own size, which would ironically be a male.\" The post backfired on Biles, drawing a mountain of backlash from conservative athletes and fans who accused Biles of abandoning the very women she inspired. Biles' own former Olympic teammate, MyKayla Skinner, even publicly condemned Biles as a \"bully.\" Biles ultimately settled for apologizing to Gaines. Amid the chaos of the feud, it was revealed that USA Gymnastics deleted its transgender participation policy. It foreshadowed a much larger change that would come to USA Gymnastics the following month. July On July 1, the University of Pennsylvania reached a resolution agreement with the Trump administration’s Department of Education after a Title IX compliance battle rooted in the Lia Thomas controversy. UPenn agreed to bar transgender athletes from women’s teams and to revise its women’s swimming record books, erasing Thomas’s marks from the program’s history. The settlement carried a blunt political message: if an elite university could be forced to retroactively \"correct\" what the government said was a Title IX violation, any school in the country could be next. San Jose State University, which was embroiled in a similar national controversy in 2024 over Blaire Fleming, has also been under investigation since February. SJSU came under heavy scrutiny in July amid Fox News Digital reporting of how an investigation into misconduct allegations was carried out. The White House, Department of Justice and multiple members of congress condemned the handlers that enabled the situation at SJSU. On July 3, the U.S. Supreme Court of the United States agreed to take up multiple high-profile cases involving state bans on transgender athletes. The cases — Little v. Hecox from Idaho and West Virginia v. B.P.J. from West Virginia — asked the justices to decide whether laws prohibiting transgender girls and women from competing in girls’ and women’s sports violate the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause and federal civil rights law, Title IX. On July 9, just like it had against Maine in April, the DOJ filed a lawsuit against the California Department of Education (CDE) and the CIF, alleging that the state’s policies allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports violated Title IX. The lawsuit also clarified what the Trump administration wanted the fight to be about: not just \"sports fairness,\" but civil rights enforcement. Arguably the biggest quake of the year on the issue happened on July 21. That day, the USOPC updated its athlete safety policies to comply with Trump's \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order. USA Fencing, the subject of widespread criticism after Turner's protest, was one of the first US Olympic organizations to publicly announce it had updated its gender eligibility policy to comply with the USOPC's new guidance. By the end of July, the movement to \"save women's sports\" had all the momentum. But resistance remained. August On Aug. 1, Wagner College quietly reached a resolution with the Trump administration to address the fact that the school rostered the transgender fencer that Turner protested earlier in the year. The private Staten Island school agreed to revise its athletic policies to comply with the administration’s interpretation of Title IX, barring males from women’s teams and aligning itself with the NCAA’s updated standards, similar to the resolution with UPenn. The Wagner resolution was notable not because of the school’s size or athletic profile, but because it reinforced a growing pattern: universities were increasingly choosing settlement over resistance. But resistance came via the trans athletes themselves. A pair of trans athletes began to file their own lawsuits against institutions in response to allegedly being kept out of women's events. Trans athlete Evelyn Parts sued Swarthmore College for alleged removal from the women's track and field team, but the lawsuit also claimed Parts was added back onto the team later in the season, despite the NCAA's new guidelines. Another trans athlete sued a smaller school that was not part of the NCAA, Westcliff University and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletes (NAIA), alleging removal from the women's volleyball team. Later in the month, Trump suggested that the U.S would push for mandatory gender testing at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, framing the move as a necessary safeguard to protect women’s sports on the world stage. The statement marked the administration’s clearest signal yet that its definition of sex would not stop at American schools or governing bodies, but would be carried into global competition. That philosophy went into effect on the global level that same month. World Boxing, the international governing body for the sport of boxing, announced a new policy mandating sex testing to ensure only females compete in the women's category. The change came a year after the world watched Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting, two boxers who previously failed sex tests, win women's Olympic boxing gold medals in Paris, prompting global backlash. September Two girls' high school volleyball players in California thrust their school district into a national spotlight when they stepped away from their team in protest of a trans athlete, and later filed a lawsuit against the school district over their alleged experience with the trans athlete over the previous three years. One of the girls, a Muslim American, added a new layer to the debate by pointing out that sharing a locker room with, and changing in front of, a male was a violation of her religious beliefs. Many critics on social media pointed out how the Democrats' ongoing support of trans athletes in girls' sports was now also compromising a person who belonged to a group they also claimed to champion in recent years. Newsom's office ultimately addressed the situation and suggested the state's growing wave of trans athletes competing in girls' sports, and opposition to it, was not his responsibility. \"CIF is an independent nonprofit that governs high school sports. The California Department of Education is a separate constitutional office. Neither is under the Governor’s authority. CIF and the CDE have stated they follow existing state law — a law that was passed in 2013 and signed by Governor Jerry Brown (not Newsom) and in line with 21 other states. For the law to change, the legislature would need to send the Governor a bill. They have not,\" Newsom's office told Fox News Digital. Another high-profile Democrat distanced themselves from the topic that same month. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, in her book \"107 Days\" set the record straight on her stance on the issue. \"I agree with the concerns expressed by parents and players that we have to take into account biological factors such as muscle mass and unfair student athletic advantage when we determine who plays on which teams, especially in contact sports,\" Harris wrote. Toward the end of the month, a lawsuit brought by Gaines and a group of other current and former female college athletes against the NCAA over their experience competing against Thomas and other trans athletes reached a crucial procedural turning point. U.S. District Judge Tiffany R. Johnson issued a ruling on Sept. 25 that dismissed most of the plaintiffs’ claims against the NCAA and other defendants, but allowed a central Title IX claim against the NCAA to proceed to the next phase of litigation. Gaines' attorney Bill Bock told Fox News Digital that a key condition to settle the lawsuit would be the NCAA agreeing to a consent decree. October In early October, a coalition of Minnesota school board members launched a formal appeal to state authorities to bar transgender athletes assigned male at birth from competing in girls’ sports, urging compliance with a recent federal Title IX finding that the state’s inclusive policy violated federal nondiscrimination standards. Signers — representing roughly 40 school districts across the state — sent a letter to the Minnesota Department of Education, the Minnesota State High School League, the state attorney general, and the governor calling for state policies to align with the federal government’s position and avoid the loss of education funding. Minnesota had been one of the states most resistant to complying with Trump on the issue, and dying on that hill was starting to garner backlash from educators within the state, just as it had in Maine and California. Weeks later, the Supreme Court cases set to define the future of transgender athlete bans continued moving forward. In Little v. Hecox, a federal judge rejected an attempt by transgender plaintiff Lindsay Hecox to dismiss the case before the justices could rule, despite arguments that the dispute was moot. The decision ensured Idaho’s Fairness in Women’s Sports Act would remain before the Supreme Court alongside West Virginia v. B.P.J. Culturally, the movement to \"save women's sports\" gained another high-profile ally. Olympic gymnast MyKayla Skinner announced she had joined XX-XY Athletics, a brand and advocacy group dedicated to protecting women’s sports based on biological sex. In late October, USOPC leadership publicly acknowledged that sex-testing policies used internationally were being discussed at the highest levels, while stopping short of endorsing mandatory testing in the U.S. The comments signaled that even as the administration pushed for harder biological standards ahead of the 2028 Olympics, Olympic leadership remained cautious — aware the global and legal stakes were only rising. Then, in the final days of the month, seemingly out of nowhere, Ocasio-Cortez went after Gaines, who had just given birth, in a series of disparaging social media posts. Gaines initially posted a photo featuring Ocasio-Cortez, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. Gaines wrote, \"We’re being destroyed from within.\" Ocasio-Cortez responded, \"Maybe if you channeled all this anger into swimming faster you wouldn’t have come in fifth,\" referencing Gaines' fifth-place tie with Thomas at the 2022 NCAA championships. Ocasio-Cortez later suggested Gaines should \"get a real job.\" Gaines challenged the congresswoman to a debate on the subject, to which Ocasio-Cortez never accepted. November Early in November, reports indicated the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was actively considering changes to its transgender eligibility framework, moving away from its long-standing hands-off approach that left decisions to individual sports. The shift came amid growing pressure from international federations that had already adopted sex-based eligibility rules, and with the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics looming. On Capitol Hill, 130 congressional Democrats filed an amicus brief at the Supreme Court urging justices to strike down state laws barring transgender athletes from women’s sports. The brief argued such bans violated Title IX and equal protection, formally aligning Democratic leadership with the legal effort to preserve trans inclusion as the high court prepared to hear the lawsuits of Idaho and West Virginia. The list of signees included Ocasio-Cortez, Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi and other members of the Democrat party's left wing like Ilhan Omar and Jasmine Crockett. The Democrats who had suffered so much scrutiny for dying on the hill of trans athletes in women's sports dating back to the last election cycle weren't backing down. They doubled-down. At a World’s Strongest Woman–affiliated competition, backlash erupted after a transgender athlete competed in the women’s division. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced an investigation into the event, examining whether allowing a male athlete to compete violated state law. Meanwhile, USA Fencing, which had been the target of months-long backlash following the Turner incident, put out a statement suggesting it was looking to turn the page after a change to its gender eligibility policy and leadership. \"We recognize the challenges of the past several months and are focused on moving forward with integrity, transparency, and a clear vision for the future,\" read a statement provided to Fox News Digital December As 2025 came to a close, December proved to be a quieter month on the culture war's front lines. The Supreme Court cases remained center stage in the conflict, and saw a handful of famed athletes jump into the fight.

CNN anchor Jake Tapper and journalist Alex Thompson co-wrote \"Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,\" an account of the cover-up that features high-level Democratic sources. The book, which was released in May, was mocked by critics who noted CNN and other mainstream outlets downplayed or were even hostile to the suggestion that Biden could be losing his grip before the infamous debate against President Donald Trump. Tapper’s network was among the most egregious offenders. Videos of Biden freezing up or appearing confused at various events went viral throughout 2024, but the White House aggressively pushed back, saying some of them were edited in a misleading fashion or didn't show what they purported. CREDIBILITY CRISIS: MEDIA EMBRACED BIDEN WHITE HOUSE'S 'CHEAP FAKES' NARRATIVE LEADING UP TO ILL-FATED DEBATE The term \"cheap fakes\" was popularized, and press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre noted from the podium that fact-checkers and mainstream outlets also embraced the term. CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz pushed the White House’s narrative last year about a video of Biden appearing to freeze up at a fundraiser with Jimmy Kimmel, saying Biden had merely \"looked out at the crowd for a few seconds\" before walking offstage with President Barack Obama, adding that \"Republicans and right-leaning media outlets\" \"used this moment to say that President Biden froze.\" Moments later during a panel discussion, CNN commentator and former Kamala Harris adviser Jamal Simmons called Biden's fundraiser moment an \"obviously selected video.\" \"These are cheap fakes, [as] the White House and Biden people are calling them,\" Simmons told CNN's Erin Burnett. However, Tapper suggested he felt differently when promoting his book, which featured numerous anecdotes of Biden appearing confused, tired and out of step, all while his team publicly proclaimed he was completely fit. In one infamous moment confirmed by George Clooney, Biden appeared to forget who the famous actor was when they spoke face-to-face. \"The Biden White House falsely — when people showed that clip and asked what was going on — said it was a ‘cheap fake.’ They did this all the time when there was video that seemed to show Biden acting in an odd or unusual, seemingly out-of-it way, they would call it a ‘cheap fake.’ It was not fake. It was actual video,\" Tapper said in May. Prior to Tapper’s about-face, CNN also cited experts expressing concern about \"ageism,\" including in the aftermath of the Robert Hur report that portrayed Biden as forgetful and confused during an interview. CREDIBILITY CRISIS: PRESS DISMISSED HUR REPORT ON BIDEN'S MEMORY ISSUES LONG BEFORE CONCERNS BECAME UNDENIABLE Ex-CNN media reporter Oliver Darcy repeatedly hammered proponents of the idea that Biden was in mental decline in his \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter before leaving CNN last year. Some conservatives took aim at Tapper directly, alleging he was part of the cover-up and tried to \"re-write history\" with his book. In October 2020, Tapper touted the Biden talking point, even showing a clip from the DNC convention of a 13-year-old Biden supporter with a severe stutter who turned to the Democratic nominee for inspiration, during a tense exchange with then-Trump 2020 campaign advisor Lara Trump (now a Fox News host), who drew attention to Biden's cognitive decline at a campaign event. \"How do you think it makes little kids with stutters feel when they see you make a comment like that?\" Tapper asked indignantly after showing a clip of Lara Trump commenting on Biden struggling for words. CREDIBILITY CRISIS: WHITE HOUSE REPORTERS SPEAK OUT ON WHETHER BIDEN'S MENTAL DECLINE WAS DELIBERATELY HIDDEN \"First and foremost, I had no idea that Joe Biden ever suffered from a stutter,\" Lara Trump responded. \"I think what we see on stage with Joe Biden, Jake, is very clearly a cognitive decline – \" \"Okay,\" Tapper quickly interrupted while talking over her. \"It's so amazing to me — a ‘cognitive decline.’ I think you were mocking his stutter. Yeah. I think you were mocking his stutter and I think you have absolutely no standing to diagnose somebody's cognitive decline. I would think somebody in the Trump family would be more sensitive to people who do not have medical licenses diagnosing politicians from afar.\" After Lara Trump insisted Biden's cognitive decline was \"very concerning,\" Tapper cut the interview short. \"Thank you, Lara. I'm sure it's from a place of concern. We all believe that,\" Tapper sarcastically told her before ending the interview. Tapper has since said he feels \"humility\" about his past work on Biden and praised conservative media outlets for discussing what was in plain sight. Tapper has even suggested that he covers Trump’s age more aggressively to make up for overlooking Biden. While Tapper’s book helped bring the issue to the forefront, CNN was hardly alone in its gentle coverage of Biden. The Washington Post used the term \"cheap fakes\" line to shield Biden from scrutiny as early as July 2022 in a fact check accusing a Republican National Committee social media post of painting \"a misleading picture of mental fitness\" based on a viral moment Biden had while in Israel. It defined \"cheap fakes\" as \"the practice of misrepresenting events that take place in a video by adding or leaving out context.\" SHIELDING BIDEN: JOURNALISTS SHED LIGHT ON THE MEDIA'S COVER-UP OF A WEAKENED PRESIDENT Fast-forward to June 2024, when The Post published a lengthy report combating Republicans sharing embarrassing clips of Biden during his trip to Normandy, including when he awkwardly paused while bending to sit down as others remained standing. \"Such deceptively edited videos, known as ‘cheap fakes,’ have become staples of Republican attacks against the president,\" The Post told readers at the time. NBC News accused Republicans of pushing a \"false\" narrative by claiming Biden was wandering aimlessly at the G7 summit. \"Experts have warned that while advanced technology like generative artificial intelligence can spread misinformation, so-called cheap fakes that often use only minor or selective editing can be more effective at spreading false narratives,\" NBC News wrote. NYT, MSNBC, PBS JOURNALISTS PRESSED ON HOW THEY COVERED BIDEN'S AGE: WE PROBABLY NEED TO DO ‘SOUL-SEARCHING’ The New York Times ran a story with the headline \"How Misleading Videos Are Trailing Biden as He Battles Age Doubts,\" insisting the viral clips were either \"edited or lack[ed] context,\" and CBS News released a report sounding the alarm on \"cheap fakes\" and their impact on the upcoming election, echoing the White House's claim that Biden is \"victim to a simpler version of ‘deepfakes.’\" MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace condemned the \"highly misleading and selectively edited videos,\" calling out the \"insidious\" trend from right-wing media.

He didn’t like what he saw.\n\nBy Kate McGee\n\nEarly this year, Texas House Republicans were at war with each other who their next speaker would be. A new megadonor emerged siding with hardline conservatives. But his splashy entrance into the conservative political arena exposed him to some divisive tactics led by conservative powerbroker Tim Dunn. Now he’s had a change of heart. From the story: \n\nFor five hours, Tim Dunn and his advisers walked Alex Fairly through the network of consulting, fundraising and campaign operations they have long used to boost Texas’ most conservative candidates, target those who they deem too centrist and incrementally push the Legislature toward their hardline views.\n\nThe two men talked about political philosophy and strategy. They discussed the Bible at length. Fairly was impressed, he said, if not surprised by the sheer magnitude of Dunn’s “political machine.”\n\n“I think most people underestimate how substantial and how many pieces there are that fit together and how coordinated they are,” Fairly said in an interview with The Texas Tribune.\n\nDunn ended the tour with an ask: Would Fairly be willing to partner with him?\n\nIt was a stunning sign of how suddenly Fairly had emerged as a new power broker in Texas politics. Three years ago, few outside Amarillo had heard the name Alex Fairly. Now, the Panhandle businessman was being offered the chance to team up with one of the most feared and influential conservative figures at the Capitol. \n\nHistory repeated itself when the Guadalupe River swept away Camp Mystic. Why few lessons were learned after the 1987 flood.\n\nBy Alejandra Martinez and Zach Despart\n\nIn 1987, 10 youth campers were killed by rapidly rising floodwaters in Kerr County. That flash flood is strikingly similar to the July 4, 2025 flood that claimed the lives of 27 girls at Camp Mystic and more than 100 others. From the story: \n\nThirty eight years and two weeks later, about 25 miles west of the bus washout, the Guadalupe jumped its banks again during heavy rain. Just like in 1987, locals and visitors were caught off guard in the middle of the night by the rapidly rising river. And once again, young campers on summer break drowned in the raging flood.\n\nThis time, the water killed at least 135 people in Kerr County and other counties in Central Texas.\n\nBut despite the ample warnings that the Guadalupe would flood the region again and the decades of time to act, the Fourth of July flood this year revealed that little had been done to protect the community against future storms.\n\nAfter the 1987 flood, river gauges were installed to provide real-time information to forecasters and emergency managers. But as the years passed, political will and funding for flood warning infrastructure diminished. An effort to get flood sirens never came to fruition; local governments were repeatedly passed over for grants by the state; and the county eliminated its own flood protection tax.\n\nIn rapidly diversifying Tarrant County, a summer of GOP redistricting hits Black and Latino representation\n\nBy Eleanor Klibanoff\n\nAs part of an effort to create more GOP House seats, the Texas Legislature embarked on a bonus round of redistricting this year. Despite explosive growth turning Tarrant County into a racially diverse swing district, it was redrawn to have whiter, more Republican representation. From the story: \n\nIn a county where 47% of voters went for Kamala Harris in 2024, there will likely be just one Democrat on the county commissioner’s court, and one corner of the county represented by a Democrat in Congress. The new districts virtually guarantee Republican candidates their seats, without having to court communities of color they picked up in Tarrant County.\n\nIt’s an evisceration of political power that community leaders fear will set them back decades. It’s especially painful that this is coming right as these communities have finally seen their political clout grow to match their increasing population numbers, Lillie Biggins said.\n\n“We don’t have a voice except through our elected officials,” she said. “If you earn something, you’ve earned it. But if you’re demanding it [or] just taking it — that’s not how this is supposed to work.”\n\nA Houston mother held by ICE must choose: indefinite detention or be deported without her family \n\nBy Uriel J. García\n\nMargarita Avila, a Houston mother of nine, was detained by ICE after an altercation that led to no charges. Her close-knit family members weigh their futures if she is deported. From the story: \n\nJeremiah crumpled his card, which bore a note written in Spanish in his child’s scrawl: “Mother, I love you, and thank you for having me.” He leaned against his other sister, 27-year-old Ester Avila, who hugged him as she wiped her tears away.\n\nIt was the first time any of them could remember Margarita missing a Mother’s Day. She had been sitting in a cell in an immigrant detention center since March as the Trump administration was preparing to deport her to Belize, where she left two decades ago because of threats to her family.\n\n“It’s really hard to see everything my wife is going through,” José said. “It hurts not being able to be with my wife — and seeing my kids sad — because their mother is always around.”\n\nMargarita Avila, 50, is among the tens of thousands of immigrants in the U.S. targeted for deportation in President Donald Trump’s second term. Trump has said his administration is going after “the worst of the worst” in an attempt to deport 1 million immigrants annually. But six months into Trump’s second administration, at least 70% of the more than 56,000 immigrants detained across the country didn’t have a criminal record, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a nonprofit that collects and analyzes federal government data.\n\nHow the political tide turned on Mark Welsh, the four-star general ousted as Texas A&M president\n\nBy Kate McGee and Nicholas Gutteridge\n\nShortly after videos of a Texas A&M professor teaching gender identity were posted online, the popular university president was forced to resign. But that was just the final straw for the political officials and university system regents who were clamoring for a more explicitly conservative leader. From the story: \n\nDuring the short meeting at the Capitol, Gov. Greg Abbott peppered Mark Welsh with questions about the comments Texas Scorecard had dug up, and about Welsh’s views on diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. Abbott was apparently unsatisfied with Welsh’s answers, according to five people briefed on the encounter.\n\n“There’s no doubt the governor was looking for somebody that was conservative in nature, and I think that he felt that maybe Mark was not as conservative as he was hoping he would be,” Regent Bob Albritton said.\n\nBut the regents felt Welsh was the right leader for the moment. They wanted a steady leader who could calm the waters after a tumultuous summer of back-to-back personnel scandals that led Welsh’s predecessor to resign.\n\nOver the next two years, Welsh repaired relationships with many students, faculty, and alumni. But the skepticism about the “Obama appointee” and his conservative bonafides never went away. This September, a video was posted on social media of a student confronting a professor over the teaching of gender identity at A&M. Welsh defended the professor privately to the student, which was also caught on video, setting off right-wing outrage. Soon after, Albritton, who is now chair of the regents, called Welsh to tell him he could either resign or be fired.\n\nBlamed for the nation’s historic measles outbreak, West Texas Mennonites have hardened their views on vaccines\n\nBy Lindsey Byman\n\nThe small West Texas town of Seminole was the epicenter of a global measles outbreak this year. Some in the community of Mennonites who live there say they’re less likely to get vaccinated today and more skeptical of government mandates. From the story: \n\nBut outside of the West Texas town of 7,000, health experts watched in horror as the once-dormant disease spread like a drop of blood in water across Seminole and the outlying counties, hitting at least three other states and breaching international borders. It killed two children, both Mennonites like Anita Froese. It sickened at least 762 Texans — more than half of whom live in Seminole’s Gaines County — and hospitalized 99 statewide. The West Texas outbreak was the nation’s largest in more than 35 years.\n\nBut for the Mennonites at the center of it, the scrutiny was worse than the disease itself. Today, Froese and others say they’re no more likely to get vaccinated, and they’re even less trusting of the government and health officials who they feel targeted them and blamed them for causing the outbreak.\n\nMennonites questioned why measles forced their religious community into the national spotlight. They didn’t know why TV crews clamored to film them grieving little girls who they believed died from underlying conditions or negligent hospitals rather than measles. They didn’t understand the messages from outsiders demanding they leave the country for exercising their right to not vaccinate.\n\n“You’re looked at as this ignorant people that’s almost fueling this thing, like we’re having measles parties, and that was never the case,” said Pastor Jake Fehr of Mennonite Evangelical Church.\n\nThey couldn’t save their daughters’ lives in the July 4 floods. Now they’re dealing with the grief and the guilt.\n\nBy Emily Foxhall\n\nRJ and Annie Harber have leaned on faith, their community and each other to move through each day after losing their daughters and RJ’s parents. But memories of that night still haunt them. From the story: \n\nRJ faced an impossible choice: He could try to save his kids and almost surely die trying, maybe killing them too, or he could turn back. He could trust the house would hold and the river wouldn’t top the roof and that his daughters would ride out the flood, rattled but alive.\n\nTrees flew past RJ. Then a car came right at him. He started to realize the river could easily take him.\n\nIf RJ could get himself back to Annie, maybe they’d all make it through this alive. He turned the kayak around.\n\n“I had to make a decision,” he said. “And it haunts me every single day.”\n\nOnly later, around 4:15 a.m., would he see one of the texts his youngest daughter sent. “I love you,” it said.\n\n“I love you,” RJ messaged back from a house on higher ground where he and Annie sheltered with other neighbors. “Go to the roof.”\n\nEast Texans united to stop a water sale to Dallas suburbs — for now\n\nBy Jess Huff\n\nAfter a deal to pipe water from Lake O’ the Pines to North Texas came to light, residents voiced opposition everywhere they could to block it. From the story: \n\nLake O’ the Pines is one of the state’s 188 reservoirs built for drinking water. The lake’s almost 18,700 acres of surface water stretch across five northeast Texas counties: Marion, Harrison, Upshur, Morris, and Camp.\n\nBuilt in the 1950s, deep in the thick pine forest near the Louisiana border, the lake has provided drinking water to seven cities surrounding the lake: Avinger, Daingerfield, Hughes Springs, Jefferson, Lone Star, Ore City and Pittsburg. Over the next 70 years, Lake O’ the Pines became a defining force in the region’s economy and culture. Boats regularly dot the lake while visitors cast lines for ​​bass, catfish and crappie.\n\nChristopher Lepri, a Jefferson resident, said selling the water would result in a decline in tourism, growth and property values.\n\n“Lake O’ the Pines is East Texas’ lifeblood, and that lifeblood should never be for sale,” Lepri said at one town hall meeting. “If Lake O’ the Pines is drained or sold, there would be a decline in tourism, growth and property values.”\n\nAfter El Paso joined Abbott’s border crackdown, the number of dead migrants in the New Mexico desert surged\n\nBy Uriel J. García, Yuriko Schumacher and Pat Lohmann of Source New Mexico\n\nSince El Paso joined Operation Lone Star in 2022, migrant remains discovered in the desert west of the city have increased every year, even as they have declined in every other border sector. From the story: \n\nHistorically, Border Patrol’s El Paso sector — which includes all 180 miles of New Mexico’s border with Mexico and 84 miles of El Paso and Hudspeth counties in West Texas — has had among the fewest migrant deaths across the southern border.\n\nThat changed in late December 2022, according to an investigation by The Texas Tribune and Source New Mexico, when the city of El Paso joined forces with Gov. Greg Abbott to participate in his signature border mission, called Operation Lone Star.\n\nBy 2024, the El Paso sector had become the deadliest place for migrants to cross along the entire U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nFrom January 2023 to August 2024, 299 human remains were reported in the El Paso sector, the most of any sector along the southern border, according to the most recent data available from federal government data. That’s more than double the number of cases reported during the 20 months prior, when 122 remains were recorded before El Paso had adopted Operation Lone Star.\n\nSince El Paso joined Texas’ border mission in 2022, migrant remains discovered in the El Paso sector have increased every year, even as they have declined in every other part of the border.\n\nFive years after shedding Confederate moniker, a West Texas high school may be Lee High again \n\nBy Carlos Nogueras Ramos\n\nThe Midland school district rebranded Robert E. Lee High as Legacy High in 2020, part of a nationwide trend to distance public places from the Confederacy. From the story: \n\nFive years ago, she was proud of the Midland Independent School District. Its board of trustees had voted to rename a school carrying the name of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, which she considered a stain on the community, to Legacy High School.\n\nThat pride may soon give way to shame. A new configuration of the Midland school board is set to consider reverting the school’s name to Midland Lee, affixing Lee’s legacy once more. A vote may come as early as Tuesday.\n\n“My daughter is going to this school, and she’s an athlete, representing the school, not just in Midland, but when we travel,” La’Toya Mayberry said of her youngest, Erinn, a junior varsity basketball player. “What does this say to her that you want to restore a name that meant whites only?”\n\nHow building a new hospital cost this rural Texas town a place to deliver babies\n\nBy Eleanor Klibanoff\n\nA small Texas town promised locals it would build a new hospital at no additional cost to tax payers. But a series of issues plaguing rural health care providers led to leaders having to eliminate the labor and delivery unit. From the story: \n\nFacing a budget shortfall and rising costs, the hospital board had decided to cut what has long been its costliest service.\n\nOlney’s shiny new hospital, designed to serve the region for the next 100 years, would not be able to deliver babies.\n\nThe decision divided the typically tight-knit town of about 3,000 people, angering residents, frustrating local employers and economic development leaders, and pitting the doctor who still wants to deliver babies against the hospital board members who have to balance the budget.\n\n“We cannot make it make sense for us, financially,” Dale Lovett told The Texas Tribune in an interview. “We all want the same thing, to deliver babies and offer every service we can, but it wasn’t an option.”\n\nTrump vowed to end “wasteful” federal spending. Beloved Texas school programs got caught in the middle. \n\nBy Jaden Edison\n\nSweeping and sudden funding changes this year put two revered after-school programs for low-income Texans and a rural teacher training initiative at risk of closure. From the story: \n\nBut two weeks before their arrival on Capitol Hill, President Donald Trump’s administration threw one of many curveballs lobbed during the first months of his second term. The U.S. Department of Education notified state education officials on the last day of June that it would pause the disbursement of nearly $7 billion in funds for teacher development, support for students learning English, and before- and after-school programs predominantly serving low-income families, pending a review of how schools had put the money to use. That notice went out a day before states expected to begin receiving the money.\n\nFor Texas, it meant a potential loss of nearly $670 million. For Na’Siah Martin and H’Sanii Blankenship, it potentially meant losing the Boys and Girls Club, a space that has aided their growth as both leaders and individuals. Martin, 18, graduated from Navarro Early College High School in June and has participated in the club since elementary school. Blankenship, a 17-year-old incoming senior at the same school, has participated in the club for about as long as Martin.","summary":"As 2025 draws down, the Tribune reflects on some of its most memorable storytelling of the year.","url":"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/12/26/texas-tribune-2025-best-reads/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.texastribune.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0806-Texas-Capitol-RB-01.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&quality=89&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-26 11:00:00","author":"Rebekah Allen","authors":["Rebekah Allen"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.089},{"id":389167008,"title":"Trump promised to lower prices — it hasn’t worked out that way","text":"There was an event held at Donald Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, during the 2024 presidential campaign that I think about with some regularity. It involved the former-and-future president speaking to reporters while surrounded by tables showing various grocery items and the increase in their prices during President Joe Biden’s administration. \n\nTrump mostly talked about how bad his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, would be for the country, eventually meandering around the tables and reading from the labels. (“I haven't seen Cheerios in a long time,” he remarked. ) The imagery was incongruous: The billionaire president emerging from his high-end golf club to observe that the prices for things he doesn’t buy had surged during the pandemic. He never really explained how he might bring prices down; he just insisted he would.\n\nIn most cases he hasn’t. \n\nonSome of these surges in costs are directly downstream from the tariffs Trump imposed on imports.\n\nA review of nearly 170 items tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) indicates that seven in ten have seen prices increase since January. Trump has gone from being the guy outside the system complaining about things getting worse to being the guy in charge and getting blamed for still-rising costs. \n\nWhat hasn’t changed for Trump, though, is that he’s still the guy who likes to slather buildings in gold and visit his private clubs and resorts (which he’s done on 123 of the 340 days of his second term, as of December 23). He’s the guy spending hundreds of millions of dollars to build a ballroom at the executive mansion, while the price of ground beef skyrockets.\n\nBeef is one of the categories that’s seen the highest price increases since January, according to consumer price index data for urban areas through November (the most recent date available). Some of the other largest increases are in the costs of tax preparation, the price of jewelry and the prices of audio equipment and coffee. The prices of those items serve as a reminder of another way in which Trump is poorly positioned to talk about tackling inflation: Some of these surges in costs are directly downstream from the tariffs Trump imposed on imports.\n\nAn analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAgain, not all prices have increased. The price of eggs, for example, is down substantially since January — though that’s in large part because an outbreak of avial flu caused the price of eggs to soar in 2024.\n\nIn only one category tracked by the BLS have prices dropped on average: transportation, which benefits from a decline in fuel prices. Everywhere else, including in topline indices themselves, prices are still increasing.\n\nAn analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThis isn’t surprising, of course. Prices tend to go up; while deflation — prices going down — carries its own problems. But Trump promised repeatedly that he would halt or reverse price increases, promises that were obviously unattainable.\n\nIn some cases, the items with the largest price increases in 2025 are ones whose prices were already increasing over the course of 2024. Often, though, prices only started to spike this year, while Trump was president. \n\nYou can see both in the charts below, showing the 24 categories in which the price index increased the most in 2025.\n\nAn analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nYou can likewise see that the items for which prices decreased exhibited both patterns: some drops began only this year, while others (like gas prices) began to fall in 2024.\n\nAn analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAs you might expect, Trump mentions the price of eggs a lot. (Such as during his address to the nation last week, for example.) On the subject of inflation overall, though, he tends to be dismissive, clearly not wanting to talk about it. He’s blamed discussions of affordability on Democrats and the media — and suggested that it’s overstated.\n\nPerhaps he thinks it is. He doesn’t go grocery shopping. He doesn’t buy Cheerios.

It was completely jarring.\n\n'It's dystopian, like something from a George Orwell novel.'\n\nShowing the videos was suggested as amounting to a 'hate crime' in one document seen by the Telegraph. \n\nThe politics lecturer was accused of causing his students, aged 17 and 18, 'emotional harm'.\n\nThe teacher did not take the terrible allegations lying down however, launching a grievance procedure against the college.\n\nDespite this, he was still effectively forced to resign his £44,000-a-year post but received a £2,000 payoff.\n\n The Free Speech Union has said they believe the laws that were initially intended to protect children from murderers and rapists were being twisted to go after adults with unfashionable opinions.\n\nThe teacher's case was an example of child safety protocols 'being weaponised to silence someone for political reasons', the Union said. \n\nHenley College began its investigations in January 2025 following two complaints by students in his class which accused him of 'biased' and 'off topic' teaching.\n\nThe teacher was alleged to have shown videos of Donald Trump and his campaign 'propaganda' and other videos which were 'unrelated' to what was being taught.\n\nThis made a student 'feel quite uncomfortable'. \n\nThe teacher said: 'It was just terrifying; just mind-boggling. We were discussing the US election, Trump had just won and I showed a couple of videos from the Trump campaign.\n\n'Next thing, I was accused of bias. One of the students said they were emotionally disturbed and claimed to have had nightmares.'\n\nThe teacher, a practising Catholic, admits he is a Republican supporter but said he was 'not an extremist' and that his views are mainstream.\n\nIn return, he said the college itself has a 'complete Left-wing bias' and does not 'tolerate anything about Donald Trump.' \n\nOn the College's referral to the safeguarding Local Authority Designated Officer (LADO), a report said the teacher's views 'could be perceived as radical' and told the school they should refer him to the counter terrorism programme, Prevent.\n\nThe report added that his behaviour 'could cause harm to a child' and that there could be a 'criminal offence' that could amount to a 'hate crime' and that it was possible that promoting his views could be considered 'radicalisation'.\n\nThe teacher said: 'I felt completely insulted at the suggestion I was a danger to children.\n\n'It impacted my mental health. I had to see a counsellor. It upset my physical health. It was absolutely appalling. It really overwhelmed me.'\n\nBy April he was accused of misconduct in a formal letter, his alleged offence was to have caused students 'emotional harm' by showing them the 'inappropriate content' and videos and presenting 'potentially extremist views' with a 'lack of balance'.\n\nIt cited complaints made by his students as evidence towards this. \n\nOne of the videos in question was a music video - Daddy's Home by Roseanne Barr, a US comedian and Trump supporter, with Tom MacDonald, a Canadian known as the Maga Rapper.\n\nThe YouTube video was suggested to him by one of his pupils.\n\nThe teacher said he could not understand how showing this video could lead a student to be 'emotionally disturbed'. \n\nHe had been switched to teach politics in September 2024 amid staff shortages, previously teaching business studies at the college and receiving praise for his work.\n\nHe believes that a group of students targeted him since this take over.\n\nNow, the teacher is working part time as a supply teacher while hunting for a full-time post.\n\nHe has extensive family ties to the US but insists his Republican views are not extremist. \n\nThere was also a balance involved in the videos he was showing, he claimed contrary to their allegations, adding that he had shown videos of Kamala Harris to the class too.\n\nFive Trump related videos had been put on for the class before the complaint was made, he said. \n\nIn April, while he was being accused of misconduct, he wrote a letter to US vice president JD Vance, complaining of 'communist-style silencing' and his school but he received no reply, unsure if Mr Vance ever received the letter.\n\nLooking for further support, he contacted the Free Speech Union (FSU) who claimed in his defence that he was a victim of 'bullying and harassment'.\n\nThey pointed out that the accusation that he had shown a 'genocide video' to children was bogus as the video was part of the set teaching materials provided by the Holocaust Education Trust.\n\nHenley College, said: 'The Henley College does not comment on individual allegations or ongoing investigations.\n\n'We are committed to safeguarding the wellbeing of all our students and staff, and follow statutory safeguarding procedures in line with Keeping Children Safe in Education 2025.\n\n'Allegations are handled with due care, in accordance with statutory guidance, with appropriate support provided to all involved.","summary":"The Oxfordshire teacher in his 50s said he was 'likened to a terrorist' after he showed the videos, one including Mr Trump's inauguration, to A-level students.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15413933/UK-teacher-accused-posing-risk-children-referred-counter-terror-programme-showing-Trump-videos-US-politics-class.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/26/10/105027039-0-image-a-10_1766743667012.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-26 10:43:41","author":"Editor,Jake Holden","authors":["Editor","Jake Holden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.662},{"id":389233042,"title":"13 facts you didn't know about Love Actually!

You have a pre-conception in places in the world where life is very hard that love wouldn't be one of the things that people's minds are on, whereas my experience when I go to Africa is that that's completely not true.'\nIn another interview shared by the channel, Richard expressed he was also sad to lose the storyline with Anne Reid, which was there to get across that everyone in life 'has their own complicated tale of love'.\nKeira Knightley and Thomas Brodie-Sangster's age gap\n\nView gallery\n\nKeira's character, Juliet, marries Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor), but Peter's best man, Mark (Andrew Lincoln), is secretly in love with her (Keira and Andrew pictured)\n\nView gallery\n\nAnd while her script involved a very mature and grownup storyline, she was aged 17 and was just five years older than Thomas (seen), who played the youngest love story in the movie\nKeira's character, Juliet, marries Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor), but Peter's best man, Mark (Andrew Lincoln), is secretly in love with her. \nThis led to a famous scene where he confesses his feelings using cue cards on her doorstep, ending with a brief kiss before he leaves, and she returns inside to her husband. \nAnd while her script involved a very mature and grownup storyline, she was aged 17 and was just five years older than Thomas, who played the youngest love story in the movie. \nThomas played Sam, the young stepson of Daniel (played by Liam Neeson) - a boy grieving his mother who learns to play drums to impress his crush, Joanna (played by Olivia Olson), culminating in an airport dash to confess his feelings.\nAfter his airport dash, Thomas and Joanna share a kiss, which is believed to have been Joanna very first kiss in real life. \nAnd this wasn't the only time Thomas and Olivia starred as characters in love as they also had a romantic storyline on Phineas And Ferb, where Thomas voiced Ferb and Olivia voiced Vanessa Doofenshmirtz. \nFerb has a long-standing crush on Vanessa, the daughter of Dr. Doofenshmirtz. \nTheir story line evolves from chance encounters during their childhood to a confirmed romantic relationship when they are teenagers in a flash-forward episode.\nColin Firth's lake scene led to injury\n\nView gallery\n\nThe lake in which Colin Firth and his co-star Lúcia Moniz swam in was only 18 inches deep and they had to kneel down, pretending to be in deeper water\nColin plays writer Jamie, who retreats to Portugal after finding his girlfriend cheating with his brother. \nHe falls for his Portuguese housekeeper, Aurelia (played by Lúcia Moniz) and their romance blossoms despite having a language barrier. \nTheir day-to-day romance culminates the iconic scene where she jumps into a lake to save his dropped papers. \nThis lead to a proposal where he learns Portuguese to ask her to marry him. \nBut during their lake accident the two actors were actually swimming in 18 inches of water and had to kneel down to pretend the water was deep. \nColin was also injured during this scene as the lake was over run with mosquitos.

Elected after two impeachments and a felony conviction, sworn in indoors amid brutal cold, and unleashing an unprecedented executive-order barrage in his first 100 days, Trump also entered office as the oldest president ever at inauguration. A Musk-backed “DOGE” initiative further blurred lines between government and private tech. These milestones redefined modern presidencies. First president who is also a felon Trump became the first US president to win election after a felony conviction. In 2024 May a New York jury found him guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records tied to a $130,000 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election, as detailed in court records and Associated Press. Sentenced on January 10, 2025, to an unconditional discharge (no jail time, fines, or probation due to his incoming presidency), the conviction didn't disqualify him under the Constitution's eligibility clauses. Congress certified his electoral-vote victory over Kamala Harris on January 6, 2025, paving the way for his inauguration. ALSO READRead FE 2026 Money Playbook: Your Ultimate Investment Guide for the new year First to be elected after two impeachments Trump is the only US president elected after two impeachments by the US House. The House impeached him first on December 18, 2019, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress over Ukraine aid withholding (acquitted by Senate February 5, 2020). The second came on January 13, 2021, for incitement of insurrection post-January 6 Capitol riot (acquitted February 13, 2021). No prior president faced even one impeachment pre- or post-election, per Congressional Research Service records. Oldest President at Inauguration At 78 years and 7 months on January 20, 2025, Trump broke Joe Biden's record as the oldest president sworn in, surpassing Biden's 78 years and 2 months from 2021. This milestone fuelled scrutiny over presidential fitness, prompting Republican-led pushes for a 25th Amendment review clause (though none materialised) and ongoing health disclosures under the Americans with Disabilities Act precedents. The first indoor inauguration in modern memory Severe cold in the Washington DC forecast prompted the White House to move much of the January 20 ceremonies indoors, a step Trump himself announced, making the 2025 ceremony notable as an indoor inauguration (with related parade elements relocated to nearby arenas). Media coverage and inauguration-day dispatches documented the exceptional logistics and security arrangements that accompanied the move, Reuters reported. Executive orders at a breakneck pace Perhaps the most consequential \"first\" was the pace of executive action. During his first 100 days back in office Trump signed well over 140 executive orders, a number that, by multiple counts, exceeded the prior modern record for orders in that 100-day benchmark and dwarfed most recent predecessors.

DOGE: From meme coin to Department of Government Efficiency One of the stranger storylines of 2025 was the rise of a Musk-linked tech effort inside the federal government known as “DOGE”, a name borrowed from the Dogecoin meme that began as a joke in online crypto culture. Short for the Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE showed up repeatedly in press coverage and was even mentioned by Trump, including ideas about returning some of its claimed \"savings\" to Americans. Later reports claimed that DOGE personnel were working inside federal agencies and using AI and data-analysis tools, sometimes in ways that sparked controversy. Depending on who you asked, DOGE was seen as a serious attempt to speed up the government, a flashy PR experiment, or a troubling expansion of surveillance inside the state. He broke down White House's structure Trump dismantled traditional White House hierarchies, installing family scions like son-in-law Jared Kushner as senior advisor and creating ad-hoc \"war rooms\" for policy blitzes, bypassing Chief of Staff structures. By March 2025, he fired interim Chief Susie Wiles and restructured into flat \"task forces\" led by loyalists like Stephen Miller, as per Axios, contrasting siloed directorates under Bush or Obama. ALSO READUS National Trust vs Trump: Lawsuit filed against White House ballroom’s construction Why these firsts mattered Taken together, these firsts changed the tenor of US governance in 2025. A president taking office despite a felony conviction raised novel legal and political questions about accountability, pardon power, and public trust. An indoor inauguration underscored both the administration’s messaging priorities and the practical constraints of weather and security. And the executive-order blitz fundamentally shifted how policy was made, privileging speed and unilateral action while prompting a wave of litigation and state-federal pushback. Meanwhile, integrating private-sector tech teams like DOGE into government operations raised fresh debates about oversight, civil-service norms and surveillance. Overall, 2025 will be remembered as a year in which precedent was repeatedly tested. The core takeaway is simple: these \"firsts\" didn’t just make headlines, they reconfigured how power was exercised and scrutinised in modern America under Trump.","url":"https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/us-news/trumps-2025-historic-firsts-felon-president-oldest-leader-indoor-inauguration-and-executive-frenzy/4079221/","image":"https://images.financialexpressdigital.com/2025/12/rachael-3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-26 09:36:11","author":"Disha Jana","authors":["Disha Jana"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.091},{"id":389123244,"title":"Google reveals the top trending searches of 2025","text":"As 2025 winds down and the new year is around the corner, Google has unveiled its Year in Search, spotlighting the events, people and pop-culture moments that prompted the biggest spikes in search interest.\n\nCharlie Kirk topped this year’s list as the No. 1 trending search in the US.\n\nThe Turning Point USA founder was shot and killed while speaking at a campus event at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10, fueling a nationwide surge in search activity.\n\nRounding out the top five were Netflix’s hit film “KPop Demon Hunters,” the viral plush collectible Labubu, Apple’s iPhone 17 and the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which was signed into law in July.\n\nOther major spikes in search activity included New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, the AI platform DeepSeek, the government shutdown, the FIFA Club World Cup, and tariffs, according to Google.\n\nTop trending US searches of 2025\n\n1.

The Labor Department reported last week that consumer prices rose 2.7% in November compared with a year earlier. That’s an improvement from the September rate of 3%.\n\nMany economists had predicted a steeper rise. But even core inflation, “which strips out volatile food and energy prices,” The Wall Street Journal reported, came in below expectations at 2.6%. Deeper data showed progress in both housing and food costs, important markers to many voters. Food prices rose at a much slower pace in November (2.6%) than in September (3.1%). The same was true for housing costs, which were up 3.6% in September but only 3% in November.\n\nThe markets responded positively to the news. The Dow rose more than 180 points last Friday. The S&P 500 was up nearly 0.9%, and the Nasdaq reflected a healthy increase of 1.3%.\nDemocrats have been banging away at the Trump administration of late on the “affordability” issue, sensing a political advantage.\n\nThis is ironic from numerous perspectives.\n\nInflation was an afterthought for years until it again flourished under President Joe Biden. Abetted by a Democratic spending spree as the nation emerged from the pandemic, Biden presided over the worst inflation in four decades, with prices rising consistently from the start of his presidency until inflation reached 9% in June 2022. The Biden White House for months pretended the problem didn’t exist. And even as inflation began to slowly recede in 2023, it remained above 3% for much of his last year in office.\n\nIn addition, Democrats offer little in the way of policy prescriptions that will actually make anything more “affordable.” Instead, their go-to solutions typically involve additional government interventions in the marketplace — rent control, price controls, subsidies for energy usage — that disguise higher prices rather than create the economic conditions for growth and increased competition that will down prices and ensure more widespread prosperity.\n\nIt is true that, thanks to the government shutdown during October and into November, the latest data is not as comprehensive as usual. We’ll learn more next month when December numbers are released. But that doesn’t mean the November numbers are irrelevant. “It’s possible that this does reflect a genuine drop-off in inflationary pressures,” Paul Ashworth, Capital Economics’ chief North America economist, told NBC News.\n\nRising prices contributed to Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump last year. Voter malaise over the economy remains a threat to Trump and the GOP as the midterms approach. The November report is good news for the administration, but Trump and Republicans can best combat the Democratic “affordability” onslaught by emphasizing a tax and regulatory agenda that encourages economic growth and middle-class job creation.\n\nLas Vegas Review-Journal/Tribune News Service","summary":"The November inflation numbers are in, and they’re a disappointment for Democrats.

She warned that similar incidents would become commonplace within the US unless lawmakers took decisive action against Islamic extremists and sources of funding, and called upon followers to repeat Dipu Chandra Das's name.Speaking about the lynching in Bangladesh, Loomer warned that it was \"Coming to America soon if we don’t start demanding our lawmakers speak out about Islam and the Islamic-funded effort on the right to mainstream Jew hatred, anti-Christian hatred.\" She also alleged that certain American media personalities were deliberately attempting to downplay Islamist narratives that fuel radicalism and extremism, taking the name of Tucker Carlson, whom she referred to as \"Tucker Qatarlson\".

It’s delicious. But, the scent can be overbearing at times,\" said Loomer.LAURA LOOMER ON LYNCHING OF HINDU MAN IN BANGLADESHIn her latest post in which she referred to Dipu Chandra Das, the Bangladeshi Hindu who was lynched, Laura Loomer urged her followers to demand American lawmakers \"speak out about Islam\", warning that similar sentiments were well on their way to spreading from South Asia to the West unless decisive action was taken.Laura Loomer had previously warned of the \"Islamist takeover of America\" after the electoral victories of several Indian-origin Democrats like Zohran Mamdani and Ghazala Firdaus Hashmi.Dipu Chandra Das was a Bangladeshi garment worker and the sole earner of his family who was lynched by an Islamist mob who had levelled accusations of blasphemy against him. The incident took place in the midst of violent anti-India protests across Bangladesh following the assassination of firebrand student leader Osman Hadi.The incident led to outrage within India and Hindus across the world.

Warnock was elected Georgia’s first Black senator in 2021 and has been a pastor at Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church for about two decades.\n\nOn Wednesday, CNN’s Dana Bash had her panel look at the odds of prominent Democrats winning the party’s 2028 presidential nomination based on prediction market company Kalshi.\n\nBash said Newsom’s odds “shot up,” showing that he has a 36 percent chance at being the Democratic presidential nominee. \n\n“And in fact, he shot up in August when he started the fight for, which he won, for Prop50 to change the [congressional] maps in response to the fact that Texas changed the maps mid-decade. AOC is very far behind him. And [former Vice President] Kamala Harris even behind AOC,” Bash said.\n\nOcasio-Cortez had a 9 percent chance at the nomination and Harris trailed with 7 percent. \n\nBloomberg opinion columnist Nia Malika Henderson later chimed in: “The other person I might add to that is Raphael Warnock out of Georgia, who is [an] incredibly talented politician, has won in Georgia, just recently gave a speech about spirituality and affordability at the Center for American Progress. So, he is the one I think, to that list of 500 people, I would add him.”\n\nNBC News’ Kristen Welker mentioned Warnock’s Center for American Progress speech on Meet the Press earlier this month and asked how faith can address “the deepening divides” in America. \n\nWarnock said, “There’s kind of a spiritual heaviness in the land as people see a deepening and widening chasm between what they need from their government. Everything is basic as the safety of their children when they leave them…on a school campus all the way to healthcare. And as that chasm broadens, I think a kind of cynicism and despair sets in.\n\n“And rather than people turning toward each other, they are tempted to turn on each other. And that creates just the kind of atmosphere where strongmen emerge, promising to solve all of our problems in one fell swoop. We have to resist that and recognize that the way to our own wholeness and well being is to affirm the humanity of our neighbors,” he added. \n\nWarnock later added, “Donald Trump, if he’s better at something than anybody else, it’s dividing us.”\n\nHe then went on to attack Trump’s economic agenda, saying that people’s “cost for health are doubling while Congress engages in everyday political games. They’re seeing their utility costs go up, their grocery costs go up.”\n\nWhile affordability still remains an issue for many Americans, inflation is cooling. The Consumer Price Index, which tracks changes in the prices consumers pay for goods and services, found that prices rose at a 2.7 percent annual rate in November, down from 3 percent in September.\n\nTrump later lashed out at Warnock on Truth Social, writing, “Warnock spent the entire show using Religion to try and divide the Country! If a Republican, in particular ME, made those statements, it would be FRONT PAGE NEWS. He ended by saying that he was going to his Church to preach now, and while I think that’s fine, I do say, ‘What ever happened to separation of Church and State?’ That would be the first thing they would use against us but, actually, it’s something that never much bothered me.”\n\nIn response to his attack, Warnock said in an Instagram video, “Mr. President, my faith is not a weapon, it’s a bridge, and I invite you to Bible study. Maybe you can meet the Jesus I know. In the meantime, I’m going to keep fighting for the people.”\n\nWhile some are predicting nominees for the 2028 presidential election, Democrats have a more pressing matter — the 2026 midterm elections. To gain control of Congress, Democrats will have to win a net gain of about four seats in the Senate and five seats in the House.","summary":"Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia was named as a possible candidate to be the 2028 Democratic presidential nominee","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/2028-election-democrats-nominee-raphael-warnock-b2890565.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/26/2/28/Screenshot-2025-12-25-at-9-47-50-PM.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/0fhoPgjO-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-26 03:09:12","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.006}]}
