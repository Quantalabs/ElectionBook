The camera peeks around an over-flowing bouquet of purple flowers and furtively captures the singer struggling to control her emotions.\n\nTaylor, it's your camera crew and your documentary. This is less organic than Kylie Jenner's rack. \n\nSo, why is Taylor so teary?\n\nShe had, we're told, just met the families of victims of a horrific July 2024 stabbing spree in the UK's seaside town of Southport. Axel Rudakubana pleaded guilty to attacking a Taylor Swift-themed dance school event, killing three little girls and injuring ten.\n\nNow, it is of course right and decent for Taylor to counsel these families privately. \n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that she is devastated by the murder of her beautiful young fans. And the parents' pain must be unfathomable. \n\nBut I can't shake the feeling that publicizing her backstage tears – in a documentary she produced – makes the mourning a little less authentic.\n\n'I'm gonna meet some of these families tonight,' she says between sobs, 'and put on a pop concert, you know.'\n\nNo, we didn't know. You could have kept that private.\n\nIn another scene, Swift is comforted by her mother Andrea, and says: 'From a mental standpoint I just do live in a reality that is very unreal a lot of the time. But it's my job to be able to handle all these feelings and then perk up immediately to perform. That's just the way it's got to be.'\n\nYeah, you are the real hero here, Taylor! How do you do it?\n\nOn Thursday, Swift joined fellow Kamala Harris-endorser Stephen Colbert on his dying late night show to promote all the second-rate music she released this year, her next album and, yes, her victimhood.\n\n'What I look up to the most in people is career longevity — career longevity, friendship longevity, longevity in their relationships,' she said. 'And there are also [some people] that are like, \"Give someone else a turn! Can't you just go away so we can talk about how good you were?\" I'm like, \"I don't want to\",' she huffed, like a four-year-old told to share her toys.\n\nThat set off a growing legion of fed-up former fans who posted online, sentiments such as: 'Honestly… does it ever get exhausting to play the victim over and over and over?' and 'It just screams insecurity to me.'\n\nWhen Taylor then named-dropped Stevie Nicks, that sealed it for me.\n\n'I have Stevie Nicks in my life in a way that affects me positively constantly,' she told an enthralled Colbert. 'Being able to talk with her and have a phone call with her and hear what she's been through... she paved the way for me and many other artists out there.'\n\nGirl, you're no Gypsy. And, you know it.\n\nHorror show\n\nMrs Kanye West's latest stunt is a creepy 'art' performance called BIO POP (THE ORIGIN) during which the trained architect, dressed head to toe in burgundy latex, bakes a cake and serves it on a 'human furniture' table and chairs made from lady mannequins (her doppelgangers) twisted into S&M positions.\n\nShe's even slinging knickknacks inspired by medical devices, like a speculum bracelet that will set you back $2250.\n\nNo word yet if she'll sell straitjackets.\n\nOnce an outspoken climate activist, gas-guzzling uber nerd Mark Zuckerberg is getting an early start on his Bezos-strength midlife crisis.\n\nHe's taken to polluting the seas in his $300 million mega yacht, a floating monument to consumerism that runs on 291 gallons of diesel every hour.\n\nThis from a man who endorses globalist edicts like the Paris Climate accord and lectures to ordinary folk about living like a peasant.\n\nZucks to be poor!\n\nBeloved screen legend Dame Judi Dench is being dragged for seemingly lobbying for jailed rapist Harvey Weinstein.\n\nBack in 2017, when allegations about the depraved sicko broke, Dench was one of the first to condemn his 'horrifying' behavior.\n\nNow, shocked fans have accused her of tone deafness after she extended forgiveness and suggested Harvey has 'done his time'.\n\nHell, at 90 she might actually be deaf, dumb and blind!\n\nGeorge Clooney is boohooing about how hard it was growing up in Kentucky. 'I was a tobacco farmer. I cut tobacco for $3.30 an hour,' he claimed this week.\n\nGeorge, it was more like an after-school job at your grandparents' farm. Your dad was a successful local news anchor and your aunt Rosemary was a famous singer and actress.\n\nI'm from southern Indiana and went to Dairy Queen a lot. That doesn't make me a cow.\n\nNeon nitwits\n\nAre Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner huge fans of the McLaren F1 racing team?\n\nAt the LA premier of Timmy's latest movie Marty Supreme, the pair looked supremely insane dressed as matching fluorescent tangerines.\n\nCertified USDA\n\nSydney Sweeney took a lie detector test to set the record straight on her boobies.\n\nSweeney's actress-buddy Amanda Seyfried titillatingly asked, 'Are your boobs real?'\n\nTo which Sugar-t**s replied, 'Yes. I've never gotten any work done anywhere.'\n\nThe golden globes are real, folks! She may not need any augmentation, but her acting sure could use a little work.","summary":"On Friday, billionaire pop tyrant Taylor Swift released her new six-part Eras Tour docuseries.

We've paid a terrible price for pandering to eco zealots - this is why we'll all be better off now their lies have been exposed: MATT RIDLEY","text":"Finally, thankfully, the global warming craze is dying out.\n\nTo paraphrase Monty Python, the climate parrot may still be nailed to its perch at the recent Cop30 summit in Belem, Brazil – or at Harvard and on CNN – but elsewhere it's dead. It's gone to meet its maker, kicked the bucket, shuffled off this mortal coil, run down the curtain and joined the choir invisible.\n\nBy failing to secure new pledges for a cut in fossil fuels, Cop30 achieved less than nothing. The venue caught fire, the air conditioning malfunctioned – and delegates were told on arrival not to flush toilet paper.\n\nBill Gates's recent apologia, in which he conceded that global warming 'will not lead to humanity's demise' after he closed the policy and advocacy office of his climate philanthropy group, is just the latest nail in the coffin.\n\nIn October, the Net Zero Banking Alliance shut down after JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs led a stampede of banks out of the door. Shell and BP have returned to being oil companies, to the delight of their shareholders.\n\nFord is about to cease production of electric pick-ups that nobody wants. Hundreds of other companies are dropping their climate targets. Australia has backed out of hosting next year's climate conference.\n\nAccording to an analysis by The Washington Post, in the US it is not just the Republicans who have given up on climate change: the Democrat party has stopped talking about it, hardly mentioning it during Kamala Harris's campaign for president.\n\nThe topic has dropped to the bottom half of a table of 23 concerns among Swedish youths. Even the European parliament has now voted to exempt many companies from reporting rules that require them to state how they are helping to fight climate change.\n\nIt has been a long, lucrative ride. Predicting the eco-apocalypse has always been a profitable business, spawning subsidies, salaries, consulting fees, air miles, bestsellers and research grants.\n\nDifferent themes took turns as the scare du jour: overpopulation, oil spills, pollution, desertification, mass extinction, acid rain, the ozone layer, nuclear winter.\n\nEach faded as the evidence became more equivocal, the public grew bored or, in some cases, the problem was resolved by a change in law or practice.\n\nBut no scare grew as big or lasted as long as global warming. I first wrote a doom–laden article for The Economist about carbon dioxide emissions trapping heat in the air in 1987, nearly 40 years ago. I soon realised the effect was real but the alarm was overdone, that feedback effects were exaggerated in the models. The greenhouse effect was likely to be a moderate inconvenience rather than an existential threat.\n\nAnd for this blasphemy I was abused, cancelled, blacklisted, called a 'denier' and generally deemed evil.\n\nIn 2010 in the pages of The Wall Street Journal I debated with Bill Gates, who poured scorn on my argument that global warming was not likely to be a catastrophe – so it is welcome to see him come round to my view.\n\nThe activists who took over the climate debate, often with minimal understanding of climate science, competed for attention by painting ever more catastrophic pictures of future greenhouse warming.\n\nThey altered the name to 'climate change' so they could blame it for blizzards as well as heatwaves.\n\nThen they inflated the language to 'climate emergency' and 'climate crisis', even as projections of future warming came down.\n\n'I'm talking about the slaughter, death and starvation of six billion people this century. That's what the science predicts,' said Roger Hallam, founder of Extinction Rebellion, in 2019, though the science says no such thing.\n\n'A top climate scientist is warning climate change will wipe out humanity unless we stop using fossil fuels over the next five years,' tweeted Greta Thunberg in 2018.\n\nFive years later she deleted her tweet and shortly after decided that Palestine was a more promising way of staying in the limelight.\n\nScientists knew that pronouncements like this were nonsense but they turned a blind eye because the alarm kept the grant money coming. Journalists always love exaggeration. Capitalists were happy to cash in.\n\nPoliticians welcomed the chance to blame others: if a wildfire or a flood devastates your town, point the finger at the changing climate rather than your own failure to prepare. Almost nobody had an incentive to downplay the alarm.\n\nUnlike previous scares, climate fear has the valuable feature that it can always be presented in the future tense. No matter how mild the change in the weather proves to be today, you can always promise Armageddon tomorrow.\n\nSo it was that for four long decades, climate change alarm went on a protracted march through the institutions, capturing newsrooms, classrooms and boardrooms.\n\nBy 2020 no meeting, even of a town council or a sports team, was complete without a hand-wringing discussion of carbon footprints.\n\nThe other factor that kept the climate scare alive was that emissions reduction proved impossibly difficult. This was a feature, not a bug: if it had been easy, the green gravy train would have ground to a halt.\n\nReducing sulphur emissions to stop acid rain proved fairly easy, as did banning chlorofluorocarbons to protect the ozone layer. But decade after decade, carbon dioxide emissions just kept on rising no matter how much money and research was thrown at the problem. Cheers!\n\nSwitching to renewable energy made no difference – literally. Here's the data: the world added 9,000 terawatt-hours of energy consumption from wind and solar in the past decade, but 13,000 from fossil fuels. Not that wind and solar save much carbon dioxide anyway, their machinery being made with coal and their intermittency being backed up by fossil fuels.\n\nDespite trillions of dollars in subsidies, these two 'unreliables' still provide just 6 per cent of the world's energy.\n\nTheir low-density, high-cost, intermittent power output is of no use to data centres or electric grids, let alone transport and heating, and effectively poisons the economics of building and running new nuclear and gas generation by preventing continuous operation.\n\nQuite why it became mandatory among those concerned about climate change to support these unreliables so obsessively is hard to fathom. Subsidy-addiction has a lot to do with it, combined with a general ignorance of thermodynamics.\n\nNow the climate scare is fading, a scramble for the exits is beginning among the big environmental groups. Donations are drying up. Some will switch seamlessly to trying to panic us about artificial intelligence; others will follow Gates and insist that they never said it was the end of the world, just a problem to be solved.\n\nA few will even try declaring victory, claiming unconvincingly that promises made at the Paris conference a decade ago have slowed down emissions enough to save the climate.\n\nOf course, Al Gore, the former US vice–president who did more than anybody else to alarm the world about climate change and made a $300million fortune from it, has been at the recent conference in the Brazilian jungle – the one where they felled a forest to build the access road.\n\nAs he railed against Gates last month for abandoning the cause and accused him of being bullied by Donald Trump, he sounded like one of those Japanese soldiers emerging from the jungle who did not know the Second World War was over.\n\nPerhaps Gore might now regret his exaggerated preachings of hellfire and damnation.\n\nIn his 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth, for which he shared a Nobel prize, he predicted a sea-level rise of up to 20ft 'in the near future' – out by about 19ft 9in.\n\nIn 2009 he said there was a 75 per cent chance all the ice in the Arctic Ocean would disappear by 2014. In that year there were five million sq km of the stuff at its lowest point – about the same as in 2009. This year there were 4.7 million sq km.\n\nAt the film's showing at the Sundance Festival, Gore said that unless drastic measures to reduce greenhouse gases were taken within ten years, the world would reach a point of no return. Yet here we are 19 years later.\n\nGore is correct that fear of retribution from the Trump administration drives some of the corporate retreats. President Trump has already cancelled $300billion of green infrastructure funding and purged government websites of climate rhetoric.\n\nBut even if the Republicans lose the White House in 2028, it will be hard to reinflate the climate balloon. The proportion of Americans greatly worried about climate change is dropping.\n\nIf Trump takes America out of the 1992 treaty that set up the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change it would require an unlikely two-thirds vote of the Senate to rejoin.\n\nBjorn Lomborg, a Danish economist, is president of the Copenhagen Consensus which aims to give meticulously prepared evidence to support global decisions on major issues.\n\nHe has fought a lonely battle against climate exaggeration for decades. He recently explained the shift in public opinion: 'The shrillness of climate doom also wears down voters,' he said. 'While climate change is a real and man-made problem, constant end-of-the-world proclamations from media and campaigners massively overstate the situation.'\n\nA key figure in the collapse of the climatocracy is Chris Wright, the pioneer of extracting shale gas by hydraulic fracturing who was appointed by Trump as energy secretary this year.\n\nWright commissioned a review of climate science by five distinguished academics that set out just how non-frightening the facts of climate change are: slowly rising temperatures, mainly at night in winter and in the north, correspondingly less in daytime in summer and in the tropics where most people live, accompanied by a very slow rise in sea level showing no definite acceleration, minimal if any measurable change in the average frequency and ferocity of storms, droughts and floods – and record low levels of deaths from such causes.\n\nPlus a general increase in green vegetation, caused by the extra carbon dioxide.\n\nIndoor air pollution caused by poor people cooking over wood fires because they lack access to gas and electricity kills three million a year.\n\nSo yes, Gates, influenced by Lomborg and Wright, is correct to say that getting cheap, reliable, clean energy to the poor is by far the more urgent priority.\n\nSources tell me that Wright is treated like a rock star at international conferences: his fellow ministers, especially those from Africa and Asia, are thrilled to talk about the need to get energy to people instead of being hectored about emissions. Only a few western European ministers sneer, but even some of them (the British being an exception) quietly admit that they need to climb down off their green high horses.\n\nFortunately, they now have convenient cover for doing so: artificial intelligence. We would love to go on subsidising wind and solar, say the Germans privately, but if we are to have data centres, we need lots more reliable and affordable power, so we will build gas turbines and maybe even some nuclear.\n\nLikewise, throughout the tech world of the American west coast, emoting about climate suddenly seems like a luxury belief compared with the need to sign contracts with power suppliers mostly burning natural gas – or get left behind in the AI race.\n\nThe world's gas glut is impossible to overstate: thanks to fracking, we have centuries' worth of cheap gas. The tech bros are piling into nuclear, too, but that won't address the needs for extra power until well into the next decade, and the need is now.\n\nThe climatastrophe has been a terrible mistake. It diverted attention from real environmental problems, cost a fortune, impoverished consumers, perpetuated indoor pollution and poverty, frightened young people into not having children, wasted years of our time, undermined democracy and corrupted science. Time to bury the parrot.\n\nA version of this article appeared in The Spectator.","summary":"To paraphrase Monty Python, the climate parrot may still be nailed to its perch at the recent Cop30 summit in Belem, Brazil - or at Harvard and on CNN - but elsewhere it's dead.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-15379667/debunking-climate-crisis-hysteria-terrible-price-pandering-eco-zealots.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/12/21/104687733-0-image-m-43_1765573368746.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-13 01:21:35","author":"Editor,Matt Ridley","authors":["Editor","Matt Ridley"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.415},{"id":386969810,"title":"Poll: Majority of Catholics Support President Trump's Mass Deportation of Illegal Aliens","text":"A majority of Catholic voters support President Donald Trump and his immigration policies, a poll conducted for a Catholic TV network found.\n\nThe poll published Thursday by EWTN News and RealClear Opinion Research showed how those voters lean towards the Trump administration and its crackdown on illegal immigration which has wreaked havoc on American communities, the Catholic News Agency reported.\n\nThe article said the poll surveyed 1,000 Catholics between November 9 and 11.\n\n“About 54% of Catholic voters said they support ‘the detention and deportation of unauthorized immigrants on a broad scale.’ Only 30% said they oppose this policy, and 17% neither support nor oppose it,” it read.\n\nThe outlet then noted:\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that prosperous nations have an obligation, “to the extent they are able, to welcome the foreigner.” The immigrant has an obligation “to respect with gratitude the material and spiritual heritage of the country that receives them, to obey its laws and to assist in carrying civic burdens.”\n“Political authorities, for the sake of the common good for which they are responsible, may make the exercise of the right to immigrate subject to various juridical conditions,” it adds.\n\nIndeed, a statement from U.S. Catholic Bishops recognized governments have a legal right and moral duty to curb migration “for the sake of the common good,” Breitbart News reported in November.\n\nAfter beating former Vice President Kamala Harris (D) and her leftist running mate, Minnesota Gov.

That’s how long Kamala Harris’s book tour will be when combining the fall leg of the tour and the additional spring dates she announced on Wednesday. That eclipses the 107 days she spent on the campaign trail.\n\nHer speaking tour complaining will now exceed the time she spent campaigning. Perhaps that’s appropriate for Harris. It’s symbolic of the fact that she will be remembered much more for losing than for anything she accomplished in office.\n\nUnfortunately for Harris, her book tour is coming at a time when her prospects for the 2028 presidential campaign are dimming. (RELATED: The Spectacle Ep. 279: Kamala Harris’ Book Tour of Excuses)\n\nWhile in February she led all Democratic presidential candidates in a SurveyUSA poll with 37 percent support, an August Emerson poll placed her well behind Gavin Newsom. In that survey, Newsom received 25 percent support, followed by Buttigieg with 16 percent support, with Harris trailing at 11 percent support. (RELATED: Kamala Finally Says Something True, And Now She’s Truly Cooked)\n\nRecent state polls have also placed her behind both Newsom and Buttigieg. A November St. Anselm poll put Pete Buttigieg in the lead at 28 percent support, followed by Gavin Newsom at 24 percent support. Harris came in third, but well behind, with 6 percent support. A November Emerson poll in Nevada put Newsom in the lead with 37 percent support, Buttigieg in second with 19 percent support, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in third with 9 percent support, and Kamala Harris in fourth at 6 percent support. (RELATED: Pete Buttigieg: America’s Second Gay President?)\n\nLast month, the Washington Post placed her in the “middle of the pack” of Democratic presidential contenders, saying that many Democrats have taken issue with her decision to blame others for letting Biden run for office again (when she herself was his vice president and repeatedly claimed that he was cognitively capable). (RELATED: Josh Shapiro–Kamala Harris Feud Heats Up)\n\nOne question Democrats are increasingly asking themselves is why they should go with Harris in 2028 when she already had her chance and failed. Even one Democratic senator, who remained anonymous, put forward this line of reasoning against a second Harris bid.\n\nHarris is struggling with Democrats on both sides of the political spectrum. Progressives are upset with her for prioritizing winning over moderate Republicans during the 2024 election, while many moderate Democrats perceive her to be a progressive in disguise, given her extremely liberal voting record in the Senate. This week, a progressive think tank, RootsAction, put out a report blaming her loss on her decision to act as a moderate throughout the campaign, which it says caused poor turnout among Democratic strongholds.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times published this week, in which the newspaper said of Harris, “Is she now suddenly a figure of [the Democratic Party’s] past?”, Harris fared quite poorly at answering the question of why she should have a political future.\n\nShe was unable to put forward a coherent vision for the Democratic Party or explain what direction she wants to go politically. When asked by the Times what the party should do, she said, “This sounds really corny, but we have to stand for the people. And I know that that sounds corny. I know that. But I mean it. I mean it.” As for her answer on the direction she personally wants to go politically, the Times was baffled. “The elevator pitch of Ms. Harris’s ideology remains as elusive as ever,” said national political correspondent Shane Goldmacher.\n\nOne thing Harris did attempt to do in her interview was combat the idea that her national political career will simply be remembered for failure. She already has a storied place in history, Harris claimed. “But there will be a marble bust of me in Congress. I am a historic figure like any vice president of the United States ever was,” she said.\n\nHarris’s vice presidency was, of course, far from impressive. It began with a year-long period in which she was kept at arm’s length by a Biden camp uncomfortable with the dysfunction within her office. And it ended with no notable policy wins or initiatives. Her election defeat while sitting as vice president sealed the nation’s displeasure with her term in office.\n\nHarris is using her book tour to prepare for a 2028 presidential run. It’s a way to travel through swing states and interact with voters. But Harris seems not to have asked herself if spending more time mulling over her defeat is a good way to prepare for a new presidential bid.\n\nWith every book tour she does — and she has 18 more stops to go across 13 different states — she binds herself more closely to her 2024 defeat, letting it define her entire political identity.\n\nPoliticians may be granted a year to mourn a devastating political loss, but dragging her mourning period (she says of her loss that she “grieved in a way that I have not since my mother died”) into 2026 may go too far for anyone in the Democratic Party.\n\nREAD MORE from Ellie Gardey Holmes:\n\nCheaters Faking Disabilities Are Dragging Colleges Into Crisis\n\nTexas Might Be the Only State Strong Enough to Face Real Evil\n\nRev.

Or maybe it’s my irrepressible optimism (if you know me, you’ll know that’s sarcasm). Or maybe it’s my budding Christmas spirit, which is building even despite the disturbing lack of decent Christmas movies this year (Hollywood can’t make ANY decent movies. Why would Christmas flicks be any different?). But I’m listening to all these talking heads and assorted doomsayers and Eeyores who can’t stop talking about what a disaster 2026 is going to be, and, well…\n\nI just don’t agree.\n\nI think people will be surprised at how good a year America is about to have.\n\nAnd you should probably not scoff at it when I offer up such a prognostication. After all, I’m the guy who wrote the Mike Holman novels (find them here on Amazon), and they’re full of so many things which ultimately came true that I’ve been accused of predictive programming, like I was some sort of CIA info operative (and if I’m that, then my check is clearly lost in the mail). (RELATED: You Get (and Deserve) What You Tolerate. That Isn’t Good News for the UK.)\n\nBut I don’t need Holman and friends to work this crystal ball. The green shoots are visible if you’re willing to look for them. To wit…\n\n1. The Economy? It’s Getting a Little Better. And That’ll Continue.\n\nThis week, it came out that we’re now experiencing five straight quarters of wage growth outpacing inflation, which is something — assuming it continues — that people are going to begin seeing and feeling.\n\nGasoline is way down pretty much everywhere. I don’t know about you, but I hit the supermarket earlier this week and picked up a full load of groceries, and for the first time in a while, I wasn’t aghast at what it cost — it was still high, but not higher, and that was a notable change. I’m pricing a new TV for the master bedroom, and it’s considerably less than I expected.\n\nNew house? New car? OK, fine. Still got a lot of work to do there. (RELATED: A 50-Year Mortgage Is a Financial Narcotic)\n\nInsurance is the killer for a lot of American families. But a year without a hurricane making landfall on the U.S. mainland is going to help drive home insurance rates down a bit, and in several states, car insurance is going down. That’s understandable — getting rid of illegal aliens means getting rid of uninsured drivers. And getting serious about urban crime, if it’s done effectively, means a lot fewer cars get stolen, which is also a big driver of high insurance rates. Controlling our border is a big deal where car theft is involved, too — lots and lots of stolen cars go to Mexico, and the cartels are in that business.\n\nHealth insurance is a mess, and it isn’t going to get better. And the Democrats are going to do everything they can to stop any legislation that would fix the problem, other than just to throw more money at Obamacare subsidies. That’s a whole column in itself. (RELATED: Trump’s Pivot Could Make Health Care Affordable Again)\n\nBut on Thursday, the White House noted there are real wins out there…\n\nU.S. exports are up 6 percent over last year — rising to their second-highest value on record — while Inflation-adjusted exports of consumer goods are the largest ever.\nThe seasonally adjusted trade deficit with China has narrowed to its second-smallest since 2009.In the third quarter of 2025, real exports grew by a 4.1 percent annual rate, and imports fell by around 5 percent — adding about 1 percent to real GDP growth.As President Trump delivers better terms for American workers, farmers, and manufacturers, November’s deficit was cut by more than half compared to the same month last year, fueled by soaring tariff revenues.\n\n🚨 CNBC: September trade deficit comes in better than expected“-$52 billion would be the lightest going back to… WOW we’re really going back!… We’re all the way back to June of 2020!” https://t.co/opzmTSCAIk pic.twitter.com/NnU6kQHtCb— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 11, 2025\n\nHere’s another win, and it’s significant. For two reasons. First, it involves housing, and second, you can and should see this as a result of good policy.\n\nGood news for affordability. Renting is now cheaper than owning in the 50 largest metros and down nearly 4% since 2022. https://t.co/AJzzEnD5cA— Quantus Insights (@QuantusInsights) December 11, 2025\n\nRents dropping below mortgage costs are a direct result of more than two million illegal aliens going home. There is less competition for housing in America’s cities because Americans aren’t competing with as many foreigners, and that should tell you that the more illegals are sent home, the easier it will be to find a place to live. (RELATED: America Is a Real Country, Not the World’s All-Star Team)\n\nAnd eventually, the owners of those housing units who can’t rent them for satisfactory rates will look to unload them, which means more available housing stock for purchase.\n\nThere are lots and lots of things which can and should be done to make housing more affordable — Steven Crowder actually did a really good podcast not long ago going through a bunch of them — but the most brute-force effective one is simply to take demand off the board by getting rid of the illegals.\n\nYou’ll notice there are awfully few poor and working-class Americans screaming about ICE raids, right? One of my favorite scenes from Operation Swamp Sweep here in Louisiana was the one when Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol agent in command, showed up in a convenience store in a black part of New Orleans and was mobbed by the neighborhood folks who were ecstatic about what his task force was doing. The Democrats don’t want you to see this picture…\n\nYou aren’t going to see the real economic effects of the mass deportations until next year, but they’re going to be significant and beneficial for the Americans who’ve been struggling most.\n\nI could do a lot more on this, but I’ve got four more things to touch on. Next…\n\n2. The Death of the Climate Change Scam\n\nPeople are not giving this the weight it deserves, and I’m not sure why.\n\nYes, Mr. and Mrs. Loyal American Spectator Reader, I know what you’re saying. You’re discounting the climate change thing because to you, it’s been disproven as a grift a long time ago. And I’m with you there.\n\nBut remember, in marketing, you’re not selling to yourself, you’re out there hawking product to the great unwashed. And the great unwashed have had the climate change crap forced down their throats for a couple of decades now. (RELATED: The Welcome Demise of Climate Change Catastrophism)\n\nIt’s never actually taken with them, but the fact that all of the climate change narratives have utterly crashed has changed things. Even The Hill, which has fanned the climate change narratives with unbridled enthusiasm for practically its entire online existence, is running op-eds declaring that the jig is up…\n\nThe gap between alarmist predictions and observed reality is no longer possible to hide. Scientists deliberately misled the public with cherry-picked data, tortured computer models until they produced the “correct” scary result and misrepresented natural weather events as proof of climate change. What masqueraded as “consensus” was nothing more than a cartel of profiteers feeding on public guilt and taxpayer money.This was not good-faith scientific inquiry but rather a narrative designed to frighten, to control consumer choices and to justify a massive political and economic reorganization. Much of the public, sensing this dishonesty, no longer listens. The authority of the climate “experts” has been damaged, perhaps irrevocably. Their incessant cries of “wolf” failed to produce the climate beast.The climate cult declared war on the very engines that lifted humanity from hunger and hardship. Its legacy is economic vandalism and moral decay.But the spell is breaking, and what’s emerging from the rubble is not despair, but liberation — a long-awaited return of reason to a world held hostage by fear.\n\nThere are all kinds of factors to this. Obviously, Trump calling it out as a scam was a big one. That we had zero hurricanes this year, after years and years of the alarmists guaranteeing us that more and stronger hurricanes were a necessary consequence of global warming, didn’t help their cause. The skyrocketing price of energy in Western countries, something that in America is exacerbated by the necessity of more electricity to power data centers the AI revolution will require, has severed the climate change crowd from the Big Tech overlords who’ve been on their side, and that’s consequential. (RELATED: Has the Left Moved on From Climate Change?)\n\nOK, fine, you say. Climate change alarmism is melting away. So what? Why does that matter?\n\nWell, it’s one less thing standing in the way of economic growth. For several reasons, but perhaps most importantly, you’ll see fewer stupid decisions being made based on net-zero or other faux environmental rationales. (RELATED: Bill Gates Has Discovered Something More Profitable Than the Climate Apocalypse)\n\nWhen people are unfettered to make smart decisions, they’ll make smarter decisions. That means more efficiency, more growth, more progress. That means less money wasted making EVs, which means more availability of cars people actually want to buy, which means people getting hired at car plants and cars being available at more affordable prices. (RELATED: Celebrating the End of EVs)\n\nThat this is happening now, or beginning to happen, means you could start seeing real results by the second half of 2026.\n\nAnd the Democrats will have a messaging problem: do you try to revive the climate change thing, knowing that ordinary Americans are going to hate it, or do you abandon it and demoralize the Trader Joe’s Parking Lot Feminists with their Think Globally, Act Locally bumper stickers on their Subarus who make up the hardest core of their base?\n\nRemember — since Barack Obama and his gang took over that party, their electoral strategy hasn’t been attempting to seize the center. It’s been to turn out more of their radicals and hard-core ideologues than the GOP can. So when you say the obvious answer is to dump the climate change stuff, you aren’t wrong as a function of practical politics, but for them, it isn’t that simple. (RELATED: Feminism, the Nose-Ring Theory, and Our Potential Extinction)\n\nAnd when you recognize that climate change nuttery has been up there at the top of the Democrats’ list of political sacraments like abortion, anti-white racism, LGBTQ supremacism, and open borders, it’s not so easy to move on from it without paying a price in turnout. The people who’ve spent a lot more than 12 years believing planetary collapse was but 12 years away aren’t going to ignore such a betrayal.\n\nEspecially when the rest of us are healthier, wealthier, and laughing at them.\n\n3. Get Ready for the YUGE Foreign Policy Wins\n\nNo, I’m not talking about Ukraine. Eventually, that war will end — it might well end before the election in 2026 — but at this point, the number of Americans who care about Ukraine anymore is basically minimal. You might notice that your Facebook friends on the Left quietly took their blue-and-yellow profile-pic filters down, and the fact that the Trump administration is engaged in diplomacy in trying to end that conflict makes it a lot less of a political football.\n\nUkraine pales in comparison to two things that are almost certain to happen in 2026.\n\nThe first is that the Iranian regime is going to collapse.\n\nYes, people have been saying this for a long time. I get that. It’s been 46 years since the Twelver Shi’a lunatics took power in Tehran, and the world has been waiting for them to fall apart ever since. (RELATED: Iran Is Not Iraq, Afghanistan, or Libya)\n\nBut while the Iranians have spent half a century trying to punch above their weight as the military and political superpower of the Middle East, they’ve not done such a fantastic job at the basics.\n\nYou’re aware of the fact that the entire city of Tehran is about to run out of water, and the regime is now talking about having to move the capital away, right? Yeah, that’s happening.\n\nYou can’t evacuate a capital city of 15 million people without massive civil unrest. Where are those people going to go? They’re going to destabilize their destinations.\n\nNot to mention that this situation is going to call into question all that money the Iranians spent bankrolling Hamas and Hezbollah and a stupid missile and nuclear program, which the U.S. and Israel pretty much turned into smithereens this year. That cash probably could have been used a little better on desalination plants and pipelines from the Persian Gulf and Caspian Sea, dontcha think?\n\nThere is an enormous amount of activity among the Iranian expat community now in an effort toward making a plan for a new, peaceful, and secular Iran. When the theocratic revolution fully collapses there — let’s face it, when Allah won’t send enough rain to raise the crops or wash Ali’s feet, it starts to look like Allah isn’t as happy with the ayatollahs as they say he is — those discussions will start to look a lot more consequential.\n\nIran’s collapse doesn’t even require U.S. participation. It’s going to happen because of those empty reservoirs. Hungry people are angry people. Thirsty people go crazy, fast.\n\nIn Venezuela, though, we will need to do something. I’ve got a couple of links from RVIVR — one which is a piece of mine, the other is by Trent Kubasiak from RealClear — talking about the justification and necessity to take down the Maduro regime by force if necessary. (RELATED: We Should Declare War on the Cancerous Cartel in Caracas)\n\nIran going down will be a big prestige boost for the Trump administration and a nice morale hit for the average American — and particularly everybody Gen X and above who remembers the hostage crisis and is still pissed off about it. Images of happy, free Iranians waving U.S. flags, mobbing the C-130s at the airport as they offload pallets and pallets of bottled water after the regime collapses will make Democrats look like morons.\n\nBut Venezuela turning over will be a lot bigger deal than that.\n\nVenezuela turning over will have an interesting and quite likely consequential effect on our election results. I’ll just leave it at that.\n\nIt’ll also have an effect on crime in our cities. Additionally, you’ll see a lot of self-deportations as Venezuelans return home.\n\nWe used to do a lot of trade with Venezuela when it was a free country. That’s over now. Returning it to status as a market democracy will likely bring some of that trade back, though how soon we see it is a question.\n\nBut most of all, while the Democrats might look like idiots when Iran’s regime is toppled, when Maduro goes, they’ll look like… something else.\n\nAnd I’m going to just let that be for now.\n\n4. Hollywood and Big Media’s Collapse Will Matter Next Year\n\nEverybody talks about how there’s nothing on TV, and the movie industry is basically done. The record industry is done. Kamala Harris’s campaign last year wasted millions of dollars trying to enlist celebrities to throw their star power behind her, and that failed.\n\nAnd if you’re paying attention, you’re noticing that Big Media is collapsing (just like I talked about in Blockbusters — available on Amazon — which you should buy dozens of copies of and give them to all your friends for Christmas, but anyway). I’d said that Skydance’s takeover of Paramount was the most entertaining corporate saga of the modern age, but it might be that the takeover fight in which Skydance, Paramount, and Netflix are at war over Warner Bros. Discovery is even better. (RELATED: Netflix Doesn’t Want Competition — It Wants Narrative Control)\n\nWhy do you care about that? Well, consider the caterwauling at CBS News over Bari Weiss’s burgeoning dominion there. That’s a direct consequence of David and Larry Ellison taking over one of the old three major broadcast networks, and they can all see what’s coming. (RELATED: The New Editor-in-Chief of CBS News Is Not Like the Others)\n\nWeiss isn’t even a conservative. Far from it. But she isn’t a Marxist propagandist, and she now runs CBS News — and has an axe to grind against the Marxist propagandists who ran her out of legacy corporate media.\n\nBear in mind that both CNN and MSNBC — excuse me, MSNOW — have been set adrift by Big Media. Warner Bros. Discovery dumped CNN on its Discovery Global Networks spinoff, and MSNOW is part of something called Versant after Comcast jettisoned it. The legacy corporate TV news business was always a loss leader for the entertainment companies that controlled major media in this country, but those companies don’t make much money on their crappy entertainment product anymore, and now they’re getting eaten by others.\n\nIf Skydance gets Warner Bros., they’re going to control more of American entertainment than Disney does. And Skydance is not woke. At all.\n\nThis is going to matter because it will affect what’s on TV and what’s at the theater, and it’ll also affect what’s on the news.\n\nSo, your assumption that the slimeballs in the media will report this thing and that thing in a way that will kill Republicans politically? Don’t be so sure it’ll stay that way nine months or a year from now.\n\n5. Primary Season Is Going To Be Lit\n\nThis far out from a midterm election, you get an inordinate amount of pontification based on macro trends. But the thing to understand is that we know who very few of the candidates will be.\n\nIn the past, that’s been sort of a mixed bag. Frequent readers of this column know that I’ve been howling about the sabotage Mitch McConnell has done to conservative Senate candidates in GOP primaries pretty much as long as I’ve been writing in this space, and the political corpses lie just about everywhere.\n\nBut McConnell is a political corpse himself. He’s done after next fall. And his influence on, say, the NRSC is waning rapidly.\n\nI am not here to tell you the NRSC has become a positive force for the conservative movement. Just a month or so ago, I had some 20-something cub operative from that organization email me attempting to spread dirt on Blake Miguez, one of the more MAGA candidates running to unseat establishment hack Bill Cassidy in Louisiana’s GOP primary, and it was all I could do not to publish that email at The Hayride. I didn’t, because if I had, I would have blown up the poor girl’s career without getting at whoever put her up to the hijinks she was attempting.\n\nExcept here are all of these people saying that it was the NRSC that was responsible for baiting Jasmine Crockett into the Texas Senate race and scaring off Collin Allred and the other Democrats who could actually win. Even Matt Gaetz is saying it.\n\n“[Jasmine] Crockett for Senate is a total Republican op. It is a BRILLIANT Republican op. Here’s why:”Matt Gaetz discusses the Jasmine Crockett for Senate op in Texas with @PearsonSharp on a new ‘Anchormen Show”.Catch live at 7pm Eastern/4pm Pacific: https://t.co/UYoOIw87IY pic.twitter.com/8wFVGcnTfb— Former Congressman Matt Gaetz (@FmrRepMattGaetz) December 11, 2025\n\nI had this in my last column, referencing a RedState story by Teri Christoph, and I was dubious about it. But since then, I’ve had people in the know who aren’t establishment GOP fans contact me and tell me it’s real. (RELATED: Did Jasmine Crockett Take Republicans’ Bait?)\n\nIf the NRSC is going to spend the primary season sabotaging Democrats rather than conservative Republicans — even if it’s only some of the time, rather than 100 percent of the time like it used to be when McConnell ran that organization with an iron hand — this will be different.\n\nAnd Trump has almost literally nothing to do other than to go to war against RINOs who have held back his agenda. He isn’t running again, and while they might want to make him a lame duck, he’s got a lot more juice left in him than they do.\n\nAs the idiot Republican state senators in Indiana who literally gave away two congressional seats on Thursday are likely to find out.\n\nWe don’t know who the candidates are going to be, that’s what I’m saying. You might assume an angry public is going to turn on the Republicans in charge of the House and Senate, but how do you know that’s going to manifest itself in the general election? What’s just as likely is that the Cassidys and John Cornyns of the world get taken out by GOP primary voters long before the Democrats get to do it, and then it’s somebody fresh, and not hated by his or her own voters, running in the fall.\n\nAgainst the Jasmine Crocketts that the Democrats can’t stop nominating.\n\nThere’s a poll out there showing that voters over 50, who typically play a lot bigger role in midterm elections, are +8 for the GOP this year. That’s a big number.\n\nThe 2026 midterms may not be shaping up to be a wipeout for the Democratic Party, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Thursday.The Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 46 percent of Americans aged 50 and older — who tend to participate more in non-presidential elections than younger voters — said they were planning to vote for the Republican candidate in their congressional district in the midterms. Meanwhile, just 38 percent of U.S. voters aged 50 and up said they intend to vote for a Democratic congressional candidate, according to the survey.The newly released survey “shows there is still a lot of work ahead for Democrats to unify their base and to demonstrate they can meet the moment,” Joel Payne, a longtime Democratic strategist, told Reuters.In December 2021, older U.S. voters favored Republicans by 43 percent, compared with 42 percent who viewed Democrats more favorably, Reuters reported. Comparatively, Democrats notched a lead among older Americans during the same month ahead of the 2018 election, 40 percent to 38 percent, according to Reuters.\n\nAgain, I’m not making any hard and fast predictions. It’s too damned early for that. What I’m giving you is the green shoots coming through cracks in this conventional wisdom narrative everybody is trying to sell you.\n\nAnd if the people everybody is most irritated with on the Republican side end up getting blown out of the GOP primary, are you so sure the party loses that seat in November?\n\nEspecially after what could be a very good year next year?\n\nDon’t prejudge it. Let it play out some. You might be pleasantly surprised.\n\nREAD MORE from Scott McKay:\n\nDid Jasmine Crockett Take Republicans’ Bait?\n\nAre They Illegal?

And those voters may be less swayed by the kind of cost-of-living issues that have animated recent Democratic campaigns, the poll found.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continueReport Ad\n\nThe poll “shows there is still a lot of work ahead for Democrats to unify their base and to demonstrate they can meet the moment,” said Joel Payne, a longtime Democratic strategist.\n\nDemocratic candidates have in recent months been able to leverage voters’ concerns about the economy and President Donald Trump’s overall unpopularity into a series of wins that have injected energy into a party that was moribund after Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris' loss last year.\n\nThe most recent victory was in Miami, where Eileen Higgins on Tuesday became the first Democrat in almost 30 years to be elected mayor. That came on the heels of Democrat Mikie Sherrill winning the New Jersey governor’s race and Democrat Abigail Spanberger being elected Virginia’s governor last month.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nWARNING SIGN FOR DEMOCRATS\n\nBut the Reuters/Ipsos poll contains some blinking-red warning signs heading into a year where the party needs a net gain of three seats to win back control of the U.S. House of Representatives and a net gain of four seats to take the Senate.\n\nSome 46% of U.S. voters aged 50 and older said they planned to vote for the Republican running in their congressional district, 8 percentage points more than the 38% who said they would vote Democrat, according to the poll, which concluded on Monday.\n\nThe strong Republican lead marks a significant change from past midterm election cycles, held midway through U.S. presidential terms.\n\nIn December 2021 - ahead of the last midterm elections - older voters favored Republicans by only a single point - 43% to 42%. In the same month ahead of the 2018 election, when Democrats ended up winning the House, they had a small lead among older Americans age 50 and up, 40% to 38%.\n\nAs they have traditionally, Democrats enjoy an advantage among younger voters. The poll gave them an 11-point lead on the generic congressional ballot among voters under 50 -- 42% to 31%. Summing together voters of all ages in the latest poll, 40% picked Democrats and 39% picked Republicans, pointing to a tightly divided country.\n\nOLDER VOTERS MORE OFTEN TURN UP IN MIDTERMS\n\nItem 1 of 2 Democratic candidate for New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani waves next to his mother Mira Nair onstage after winning the 2025 New York City Mayoral race, at an election night rally in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, New York, U.S., November 4, 2025.

Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab Read more\n\nBut older voters are deemed more reliable voters in midterm elections, meaning there is some chance that key parts of the Democratic base won’t show up without Trump on the ballot.\n\nDoug Sosnik, a former political adviser to former President Bill Clinton, said that Democrats now excel at turning out high-propensity voters except when it comes to older Americans, which could pose a problem next year.\n\n“You have to look at everything through the prism of the midterm,” Sosnik said.\n\nVoters over 50 made up 56% of the electorate in last year's presidential elections but comprised 64% of voters in the 2022 midterm contests, according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, which surveyed 4,434 adults nationwide, found 60% of older voters strongly agree with a statement that they would regret not voting in next year's congressional elections, compared to 40% of younger voters who said the same.\n\nThat pattern played out in the recent gubernatorial elections, where both Sherrill and Spanberger managed to squeeze enough support from older voters to prevail. Both won about two-thirds of voters under 45, according to exit polls conducted by a consortium of networks including CNN, but a bare majority of voters 45 and over.\n\nReaching those voters may remain a challenge. Affordability was a central theme to both Sherrill's and Spanberger's campaigns, as well as Higgins’ candidacy in Miami. But the Reuters/Ipsos poll found that older voters are less likely to cite the cost of living as the most important issue for how they will vote next year. While five in 10 voters age 18-49 said the cost of living was the top issue, just four in 10 older voters said the same.\n\nOLDER VOTERS HAVE DIFFERENT WORRIES\n\nOlder voters may be more insulated from day-to-day worries, Sosnik said: “Wealth creates an environment of a different set of issue concerns.”\n\nSome 27% of voters age 50 and up said democratic values and norms were the most important factors, compared to 22% of younger voters. People also differed by age in which democratic values were most pressing, with older folks more likely than younger voters to cite the dangers of noncitizens voting and election fraud.\n\nIn addition, some 19% of voters age 50 and up said immigration was their top concern, compared to 12% of younger voters -- an area where Republicans have historically kept an edge.\n\nSosnik said that Democrats don’t need to revamp their message next year but rather must tweak it to draw older voters, making prosperity “an issue for all age groups.”\n\nThat means, he said, going beyond job creation and affordability to making it easier for Americans to build careers and accumulate wealth.\n\nThe latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted online, had a margin of error of 2 percentage points among all registered voters, including those age 50 and up. Among younger voters, the margin of error was 3 percentage points.\n\nReporting by Jason Lange and Jim Oliphant; Editing by Scott Malone and Lisa Shumaker\n\nPurchase Licensing Rights\n\nJason LangeThomson ReutersJason Lange is a Washington correspondent focused on political data.

The data tells a different story","text":"In the spring of last year, then-President Joe Biden tried to convince skeptical voters that the struggling economy was healthy. Then-candidate Donald Trump seized on the moment and vowed to lower prices for American consumers, beating his eventual Democratic rival Kamala Harris in part with a winning economic message.\n\nNow it's President Trump who's trying to persuade the public that the state of the economy is sound, after prices rose 3% in the 12 months ending in September and with consumers spending less on big-ticket items. \n\nBetsey Stevenson, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, says making that argument could be a tall order in the face of rising costs for a number of goods and services.\n\n\"My personal takeaway from the experience we had [in 2024] was that you can't tell people that prices aren't up when they're up,\" she said.\n\nWhile the prices of some items such as gasoline have fallen on Trump's watch, the overall cost of living has continued to climb. For example, grocery costs are up 2.7% for the year ending in September and electricity costs have jumped more than 5%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\"Trump's claims about inflation are false,\" Stevenson said, \"and you can go to the grocery store and see it yourself.\"\n\nBut, in a wide-ranging speech to supporters on Tuesday, Trump both defended his administration's track record on the economy and said that talk of affordability was overblown. Trump told the crowd in Mount Pocono, Pa., that he believed the term \"affordability\" was a \"hoax\" perpetrated by Democrats. Trump's recent assertions dismissing inflation are not backed by official government economic data.\n\nConsumers are feeling high prices firsthand\n\nWhile it's true that inflation hit a 9% high during the summer of 2022 under the Biden administration, that was during the pandemic and it dropped significantly after that. Inflation dipped to an annual rate of 3% in January during Biden's final month in office, the same rate it was in September under Trump.\n\nNow many voters are questioning how well Trump is tackling the stubbornly high costs of everyday items. Some 57% of voters said in a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll released this week that Trump was \"losing the battle against inflation,\" while 68% of respondents to a AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll from October said the economy was poor or very poor.\n\nVoters' souring attitudes on the Trump administration's handling of the economy come less than a year before the U.S. midterm elections, in which Republicans will aim to maintain their majorities in both houses of Congress. But in a warning sign for the GOP, November's odd-year races saw Democrats who campaigned on affordability win major contests in New York City, Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nPolitical consultant and pollster Frank Luntz says Trump risks appearing out of touch if he continues to claim that affordability is a \"hoax\" when Americans feel like they're paying more — and actually do pay more.\n\n\"When you talk about affordability, it is all perception,\" Luntz told NPR's Morning Edition. \"The greatest danger is if you tell people happy days are here again, and it's 1929,\" he added, referencing the beginning of the Great Depression.\n\nLuntz added that Trump blaming Biden for the failures of the economy may have worked during the campaign season and even for some time after.\n\n\"That said, it's now a year since the election, and the public does expect this administration to take charge. At a certain point, they will not accept the blame game,\" he said.\n\nTrump's tariffs are contributing to inflation\n\nBut getting inflation to slow down or prices to drop will be easier said than done for the Trump administration, which has embraced economic policies such as tariffs that force prices upward, according to Stevenson. Trump and other administration officials have argued that tariffs are necessary to correct past global trade policies that have been unfair to the U.S. and to bring back domestic manufacturing.\n\nAlthough tariffs are raising about $30 billion per month in revenue for U.S. coffers, the new import taxes levied by the Trump administration have increased prices on a number of items, from food to clothing to furniture.\n\n\"What I find surprising is that he's out there telling people: 'This isn't happening. This is a con job.

Discovery, which recently put itself up for sale and holds the rights to movie franchises ranging from “Lord of the Rings” to “Harry Potter.” \n\nWhile Netflix moved to acquire Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion, Paramount has significantly upped the ante by launching a hostile takeover bid. \n\nParamount Skydance announced Monday it has launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire the outstanding shares of Warner Bros. \n\nDiscovery for $30.00 per share in cash, with the company suggesting it’s a “superior” offer than the recently announced $82.7 billion Netflix deal.\n\n“Just yesterday morning, my beloved parent company, Paramount, reportedly launched a hostile takeover bid for Warner Brothers valued at $108 billion. Wow. If my company’s got that kind of green, I’m sure they can afford to un-cancel one of their best shows,” he said.\n\nColbert was making a tongue-in-cheek reference to the cancellation of his own show, which will be axed by CBS in spring 2026. \n\nThe show’s cancellation follows the network and its parent company’s settlement with Trump earlier after he sued both for “election interference” over a “60 Minutes” interview edit of his 2024 opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nThis is also amid a widespread decline in the popularity of late-night talk shows as a format amid a shifting media landscape and generational change.\n\nAs the audience erupted in cheers, he eventually asked them to sit down, joking that the actual show he was talking about was the crime drama series “the Equalizer” starring Queen Latifah, and not his own show. \n\n“CBS, you head the people, bring back ‘The Equalizer!’ We need our queen to return. Why do you think America has become so UN-equalized?”\n\nColbert has not been shy about criticizing his parent company. \n\nBut one aspect of the deal, Colbert joked sarcastically, is particularly foreboding.\n\n“Turns out, Paramount got a little assist on the cash front. Their bid includes $24 billion from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi wealth funds, and when the dictator of Saudi Arabia gives you billions of dollars, I’m sure there’s no catch,” he said with clear sarcasm, going on to joke, “In a totally unrelated story, I’m looking forward to next season’s new CBS hit comedy, “Young Mohammed bin Sheldon.”","summary":"Stephen Colbert received praise after he said his show could've been saved since Paramount had more than enough cash to take over Warner Bros.

The deal would give the world’s largest streamer ownership of a 102-year-old archive including Hollywood’s most legendary film and television IP—from Casablanca to The Color Purple. The monumental sale arrives at a time of extreme economic headwinds and unprecedented job losses in the entertainment industry.\n\nThis isn’t just a historic transaction. It powers a broader global trend toward massive consolidation in media. \n\nBut beneath the headlines is a more urgent question: What does the world’s most powerful streamer combined with the most storied studio mean for Black creatives, Black culture, and Black economic power inside Hollywood?\n\nHere’s my forecast.\n\n1. A shrinking seat at the table\n\nClearing redundancies and restructuring are inevitable in acquisitions at this scale, and shareholders mandate it to reduce costs. Unfortunately, Black senior leaders and Black middle managers often bear the brunt of cuts. Warner Bros. Discovery only has a handful of Black senior leaders, including Channing Dungey, Warner’s Chairman and CEO of their television group, and a longtime entertainment leader who previously ran ABC Entertainment. Under Netflix rule, a company with a vastly different operating structure, does Dungey’s role and influence survive?\n\nAnd what of Black employees in the middle layers of the company, who are already significantly outnumbered? Consolidation typically leads to fewer Black decision makers in the room, fewer champions for diverse storytelling, and waning influence during a period already defined by anti-DEI backlash.\n\n2. Conglomerates trigger steely gatekeeping\n\nSinners delivered a culture-shifting win for Warner Bros, defying the decline of theatrical releases, with a global box office nearing $400 million. But the scale of Warner’s $90 million investment on the Coogler–Jordan partnership is an anomaly. For the average Black filmmaker, passing through Hollywood’s steely gatekeepers remains extraordinarily difficult. Even when projects clear that bar, many face early cancellations or one-season fates.\n\nIn summer 2021, HBO infamously cancelled Misha Green’s Lovecraft Country after a single acclaimed season and has offered very few Black-led series since. But it’s also important to acknowledge historical context. Consolidation does not automatically mean fewer opportunities for Black film and TV.\n\nIn the era when Time Warner operated as one of the world’s most powerful entertainment conglomerates, it housed Warner Bros., Warner Music Group, Time Inc., including People, Entertainment Weekly, Essence, and the book publisher Simon & Schuster.\n\nDuring that period, Warner fueled the heyday of Black cinema in the 1990s with titles like Set It Off, Friday, and Hoodlum, and powered the rise of Black sitcoms, among them include classics Family Matters and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\n\nBut that same conglomerate also produced the nadir of Black cinema and the dearth of the Black sitcom, often justified under the biased theory Black-led stories are “too niche” or lacked broad cultural appeal.\n\nConsolidation creates possibility and danger. Historically, offering Black storytellers a platform and later, snatching it away.\n\n3. Data-driven decision-making overrules creative risk\n\nNetflix is fundamentally a technology company. Its ethos prioritizes data, optimization, and agility. This is smart business but often overshadows creative risk-taking, which is the spinal cord to cultural progress.\n\nUnder a Netflix-led Warner Bros., would Sinners have been greenlit at that scale? Would Coogler have secured such a rare, creator-favorable deal structure?\n\nData-driven forecasting is often used to reinforce the disproven myth that Black film and TV don’t perform. When data intelligence overrules cultural intelligence, Black storytelling becomes vulnerable to algorithmic erasure.\n\nTo Netflix’s credit, the streamer backed series like Mara Brock-Akil’s Forever and Survival of the Thickest starring Michelle Buteau and Tasha Smith. But inheriting Warner’s creative engine means the bar must be set higher. Way high up. Not merely maintained.\n\n4. Deepened dependency on Black dollars and cultural power, with little investment\n\nA Netflix–Warner Bros. combination creates the single most powerful entertainment company in the world. But no entertainment company generates meaningful profits without Black consumers, who historically over-index on time spent on entertainment, and whose cultural leadership and taste drive innovation across the industry.\n\nNetflix leans heavily into “Strong Black Lead”, a social-first marketing vertical launched early 2018 to increase Black subscribers. The streamer’s leadership, including co-CEO Ted Sarandos, publicly supported former Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential run. But there remains a wide gap between messaging and the company’s investment in Black senior leaders, Black producers, and Black original programming.\n\nA merger at this scale could also trigger subscription cost increases, disproportionately impacting communities already facing inflation in housing, food, and digital access. Black influence fuels the entertainment business. Yet Black creatives rarely receive equitable investment in return.\n\nThe Road Ahead: antitrust, power, and the stakes for Black culture\n\nAlthough the sale is agreed upon, it still requires regulatory approval. The Department of Justice and the FCC will evaluate antitrust implications—concerns that often lead to required divestitures, spin-offs, ownership caps, or mandates around content distribution.\n\nFollowing Netflix’s deal announcement, Paramount, in a last ditch effort, launched an even more aggressive bid to secure Warner Bros, including its television networks, valued at $108.4 billion. David Ellison’s SkyDance company acquired Paramount for $8 billion summer 2025 with support from father Larry Ellison, co-founder of software company Oracle. Skydance has since laid off over 1,000 Paramount employees. Both father and son have shown political alignment with President Trump behind-the-scenes. Reportedly, Trump is more enthusiastic about Ellison’s bid for Warner, signaling the president would push for speedy FCC approval. \n\nThough the Ellisons’s offer for Warner far exceeds Netflix by some $36 billion, Sarandos remains confident its deal will close.\n\nEven if Netflix wins FCC approval to merge Warner into their streaming operations, in a Trump nation begetting anti-DEI actions, chances regulators prioritize protections for Black creatives are slim. What does it say about Hollywood and America if the most consequential entertainment merger of our time leads to measurable decline in Black influence and Black creative access? Hollywood sits on the backbone of Black talent and storytelling. This moment will pressure-cook a time of mercurial change and will test if the industry intends to honor this truth or consolidate past it.","summary":"The NetflixWBD Sale Means Fewer Seats for Black Creatives and Culture","url":"https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/the-netflix-wbd-sale-means-fewer-seats-for-black-creatives-and-culture/","image":"https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/3eeb42c7-656d-4992-9b52-f7179cbe727d.png?w=600&h=315&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-11 01:34:27","author":"Geneva S.

But hurdles loom large","text":"“We’re putting in the work,” Fried said. “We’re getting great candidates, and now it’s time for us to continue building this momentum into 2026.”\n\nBut Democrats still have to contend with some serious headwinds in Florida. They’re heading into the midterms with a 1.4 million-voter registration disadvantage against Republicans. And the GOP in Florida has massively more cash than Democrats, raising $12.7 million during the first three quarters of this year compared to Democrats’ $1.5 million — not to mention severe morale and infighting issues that plagued the state party.\n\n“This was a small win for Democrats … but they’ve turned this into big national news to keep their donors happy,” said Angie Wong, a Republican executive committee member in Miami.\n\nMiami, unlike most of Florida, has a 23,000-person voter registration advantage in favor of Democrats when counting both active and inactive voters. While Trump won Miami-Dade County by 11 points in 2024, he lost the city to former Vice President Kamala Harris by 1 point. Its outgoing GOP mayor, Francis Suarez, started out his years in office shunning policies from Trump and DeSantis — though he’s come around since. Despite losing Miami, Republicans won a special election for the state Senate on Tuesday night and maintained a majority on the Miami city commission.\n\n“Republicans are gaining strength, and trajectory on voter registration is not slowing,” said Evan Power, chair of the Republican Party of Florida. “The fact is, Democrats making a lot of noise about a Kamala City shows how little movement they have. The Democrat Party is still on the verge of extinction in Florida.”\n\nFlorida Democrats also faced cratering morale and infighting earlier this year, with the state Senate Democratic leader leaving the party and two state House members flipping to the GOP after the 2024 election. One Miami-based Democratic political organizer, who was granted anonymity to relay a candid assessment, said there was still 11 months until the next election with “infinite opportunities for leadership” to mess it up, including if they choose to “meddle in primaries” or “get bogged down in the whole progressive vs. establishment” fight.\n\nStill, the Miami race gave Democrats a jolt of excitement as it became more nationalized, coming a week after the party overperformed in a House special election in Tennessee. The Democratic National Committee sent volunteers to help, and major Democrats — including rumored 2028 candidates for president — popped into the Magic City or endorsed Higgins over social media as her prospects for victory improved.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/10/miami-democrats-florida-midterms-00685470","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/fc98d0c/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F34%2F24%2F47a1b5c947a89c18d55bf7672b51%2Felection-2025-mayor-miami-89452.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 23:00:00","author":"Kimberly Leonard","authors":["Kimberly Leonard"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.033},{"id":386928088,"title":"Kamala Harris quells new speculation about CA governor run in 2026","text":"Kamala Harris’ team is shooting down speculation that the former vice president is again considering a run for California governor next year, after she announced in July that she would not.\n\nFueled by polls showing a weak Democratic field of gubernatorial candidates, political circles were abuzz this week that Harris, the former Democratic presidential nominee, was having second thoughts.\n\nTwo sources close to Harris who were unauthorized to speak publicly confirmed Wednesday that she plans to stay out of the race.\n\nAfter her 2024 loss to President Donald Trump, Harris initially considered running in California’s open governor’s race next year but in July announced that her future public service “will not be in elected office.” On Wednesday, an aide pointed to that announcement when asked if Harris was reconsidering.\n\nHarris recently told the New York Times that she planned to “ramp up” her political engagement in 2026, forming a political action committee and paying the Democratic National Committee $7 million for her email list.\n\nShe has spent the last two months on a book tour for “107 Days,” her memoir about her truncated presidential campaign, and on Wednesday announced added more than a dozen new stops in early 2026.\n\nRumors flew around political circles in recent days that Harris was reconsidering her decision to stay out of the California race, citing the lack of a gubernatorial frontrunner. With six months to go until the primary election, recent polls have shown nearly a third of California voters are undecided about whom to support in the governor’s race.\n\nAttorney General Rob Bonta is also believed to be considering a run for governor after initially saying in February that he would focus on his current position — a claim he reiterated last week to reporters. His adviser, Dan Newman, did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.\n\nAn Emerson college poll conducted in early December showed two Republican candidates leading the state’s gubernatorial field, with Democrats Eric Swalwell and Katie Porter close behind.\n\nAfter losing the 2024 election, Harris initially regrouped in Los Angeles out of the public eye.\n\nIn her memoir and in interviews, she has swiped at Newsom, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who she considered as a running mate before deciding on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nShe wrote that Newsom initially declined her calls after former president Joe Biden dropped out and endorsed her because he was on the treadmill, and later on a hike.\n\nLater that night, Newsom endorsed Harris.

The nonpartisan race turned into a red-versus-blue contest with President Donald Trump’s endorsement of Emilio Gonzalez, a Republican, and the infusion of resources Higgins got from national Democrats. But does this mean Florida — and Miami-Dade County, which Trump easily carried in 2024 — are back in play for the Democratic Party?\n\nWithout doubt, Higgins made history as the first woman to lead Miami and the first elected mayor to run as a Democrat since the 1990s. But we should be careful with extrapolations, especially when turnout in city elections are embarrassingly low: fewer than 38,000 Miamians voted Tuesday — out of 176,000 registered voters.\n\nWe wish this election had remained nonpartisan. But in today’s politically polarized climate, it was only a matter of time before local races— where issues such as affordability, infrastructure and public transportation shouldn’t be partisan — became embroiled in party politics.\n\nAlas, that ship has sailed.\n\nThe mayoral race became a test for two things: whether Democrats can crawl their way out of the electoral hole they dug for themselves in South Florida, and whether a Trump endorsement sinks or elevates candidates in a general election.\n\nGonzalez lost by nearly 20 points. The fact that Trump’s support did not get him elected is no surprise. The president’s endorsement may work in a GOP primary but a general election in a city that Kamala Harris carried, albeit by a slim margin, in 2024 is a different story. Trump’s support also failed to get several candidates elected in important U.S. Senate and gubernatorial races across the country in 2022. Trump has also lost support among Hispanic voters, a key demographic in Miami.\n\nIn hindsight, would Gonzalez have been better off running only on his résumé as a former city manager and retired Army colonel who reversed in court the city commission’s decision to move the 2025 elections to next year without voter approval? Even that might not have been enough to close the gap on Higgins’ advantage.\n\nThe Tuesday election was a “shot in the arm” for Democrats, Fernand Amandi, a Miami Democratic pollster, told the Herald Editorial Board.\n\n“I think, for the first time, they have something they can start to build on,” he said.\n\nHiggins’ win will encourage Democratic donors to take a second look at Florida, a state the party has essentially written off in recent elections, and it’s an indicator they should not ignore the state anymore, Amandi said. But even the most optimistic Democrats are probably not saying this suddenly means Florida is back in play for them. The 2026 elections will still be a challenge for the party that has been hemorrhaging voters and has ceded control to the GOP, including in former blue bastions like South Florida.\n\nNow that Higgins has won two competitive races — for mayor and Miami-Dade County commissioner in 2018 — consultants will inevitably begin looking at her next political move (she gave up her county seat less than halfway through her second term to run for mayor). But Higgins must focus on implementing an ambitious agenda that includes streamlining the city’s slow permitting system, building more affordable housing and improving public transit.\n\nAbove all, Higgins’ legacy will be defined by whether she can change the image of Miami from a city hall where scandals and bad behavior are the status quo. She will have to accomplish all of that with the limited powers Miami’s charter gives her position. Unlike the mayors of Miami-Dade County and other cities, she will not have administrative powers, which are delegated to a city manager she can appoint. Higgins, however, should be strategic with her existing powers to veto legislation and whip votes on the commission on issues she cares about.\n\nMiami’s mayoral election was a good night for the Democratic Party, but the real measure of success will be if the next four years are better for the residents of the city.","url":"https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/editorials/article313584485.html","image":"https://www.miamiherald.com/public/latest-news/ugoj2y/picture313568181/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/MIA_EILEENHIGGINSELECTIONAGS085.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 19:24:56","author":"The Miami Herald Editorial Board","authors":["The Miami Herald Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.586},{"id":386887352,"title":"Kamala Harris to visit Madison book tour about failed presidential bid","text":"MADISON - Kamala Harris will bring her book tour to Madison next year, promoting her account of the whirlwind 2024 presidential election and her loss to Donald Trump.\n\nHarris will appear at the Orpheum Theater in downtown Madison at 1 p.m. on Sunday, March 1.\n\nThe event is being held in partnership with local bookstore A Room of One's Own. \n\nThe visit is one of 18 appearances Harris will make across the U.S. this spring, following her 17-stop fall 2025 tour. \n\nThe former Democratic nominee for president stepped into the race after Joe Biden dropped out, after facing pressure and scrutiny regarding his age and mental faculties.\n\nBut her run, limited to 107 days, was not without controversy, which is detailed in her book, aptly named \"107 Days.\"\n\nHarris shares details about her relationship with Biden, her regrets regarding the campaign and goes as far as to criticize her running mate, Minnesota Gov.

Once upon a time, aspiring public intellectuals and digital-native commentators had blogs. Then they had Twitter accounts, snarking from behind cartoon avatars; then podcasts, speaking into microphones into the void; then newsletters, publishing reams of text into our inboxes. In all of those formats, the human body was conspicuously absent—but no longer. With the rise of the somewhat oxymoronic video podcast, the de-rigueur medium is a digital talk show of one, an eponymous production performed—face, body, outfit, and soul—for the camera. We don’t just listen to Friedland, Ezra Klein, “Call Her Daddy” ’s Alex Cooper, “Talk Easy” ’s Sam Fragoso, “Throwing Fits” ’s James Harris and Lawrence Schlossman, or myriad other podcast proprietors anymore; we watch, often in closeup, every expression that flits across their faces, and thus cultivate a kind of parasocial intimacy usually reserved for Hollywood actors. There is no more hiding behind a byline; the moment mandates hair stylists and makeup. And, with the end of faceless punditry, measured neutrality moves toward obsolescence, too. The quality that hosts need in order to court and maintain audiences online is a dose of charismatic feeling, preferably caught in thirty seconds or less.\nA few early adopters have been broadcasting their podcasts on video for many years. Joe Rogan has been filming his podcast since it launched in 2009, and the tech tastemaker Lex Fridman started filming his conversations back in 2018. But the mass rush toward video podcasting began with the 2024 Presidential race, which made clear just how much influence on public opinion shows like Rogan’s exerted. Donald Trump, J. D. Vance, and Elon Musk all took their turns doing three-hour gab sessions with Rogan in the run-up to Election Day; that August, Trump went viral discussing addiction in an unusually touchy-feely moment on Theo Von’s video podcast. MAGA’s success reaching voters this way—and Kamala Harris’s regrettable decision not to go on Rogan—sparked a realization that the medium was more than passive man-cave listening. Early this year, YouTube revealed that a billion monthly users consumed podcasts on its platform and declared itself “the most frequently used service for listening to podcasts in the U.S.”\nDuring Trump’s first year back in office, D.I.Y. footage of two people talking into microphones has shaped the news cycle as much as any cable network. In January, the Times columnist Ross Douthat patched Steve Bannon in over Zoom for a conversation first aired on an episode of the Times’ “Matter of Opinion” podcast and then syndicated on Douthat’s new video podcast, “Interesting Times.” In a surreal mise en scène, Douthat, appearing in high res in a cozy studio, watched Bannon’s face on a laptop as he denounced “Broligarchs” such as Musk, whose DOGE operations were ramping up at the time, signalling the first clear schism between the MAGA right and the tech overlords who backed Trump in 2024. (Watching someone watch a Zoom call is a video-podcast innovation of dubious appeal.) Then, in February, Musk made a redux appearance on Rogan’s show and delivered one of his most in-depth public discussions of DOGE; on YouTube, the episode racked up more than fourteen million views. The video podcast was suddenly a news-making venue, a makeshift press conference at a time when, thanks in part to Trump’s draconian approach to the First Amendment, press was more limited than ever.\nWhat’s motivating the turn to video goes beyond the strategic utility of cultivating intimacy with an audience; the trend has equally to do with the structural mechanics of disseminating content online. Even as podcasts exploded in popularity during the early twenty-tens, the form had problems with discovery and distribution. Isolated bits of audio were not likely to go viral, because there was no centralized social-media-style feed for audio content, and because the major podcasting apps did not use algorithmic recommendations to help creators find fresh audiences. If you are an audio podcaster looking for listeners, you have to rely on word of mouth or pop up on other productions hoping to grab some of their fans. But, if you piggyback your audio release on video channels, you can reach new audiences through the automated feeds of YouTube, TikTok, and X. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, apparently hoped to benefit accordingly when he débuted a video podcast, “This Is Gavin Newsom,” in March, that seemed intended to plant him in the public psyche as a 2028 Presidential contender. (By the next election, perhaps YouTube-channel-subscriber numbers will be as meaningful as a candidate’s performance in the polls.) The same month, Amy Poehler, an actor, writer, and comedy power-producer who ostensibly has little need for a new platform, launched her own video podcast, “Good Hang,” fostering a direct audience outside the usual Hollywood channels. There’s a certain levelling effect at play: no matter how big your name is, the ideal media strategy today seems to be a stage set and a microphone. In August, Taylor Swift used “New Heights,” the video podcast co-hosted by her now fiancé Travis Kelce, to divulge details of her latest album. Watching fans pore over the footage for clues in the couple’s body language, one couldn’t help but think that audio doesn’t stand a chance.\nThe video podcast has established a new aesthetic of information—or perhaps just revived one that was more familiar in the era of “Crossfire” debates on CNN. We watch for signs of emotional gravitas as much as for the content of what is being said. Authority adheres to hosts through their acts of sheer duration, with some broadcasting several times a week or for hours every day. Through video, we get to know our pundits the same way we engage with influencers, and the more we are convinced by their multimedia performances the more readily we join their podcasting personality cults. Increasingly, this world of digital broadcasting is embroiled in slow-burning rivalries and rhetorical fights, a Marvel universe of independent opinion-givers. In September, the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates appeared on Ezra Klein’s hit Times podcast, “The Ezra Klein Show,” which transitioned to video late last year. Coates was there to discuss a column that Klein had written about the assassination of the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, in which Klein argued that Kirk had practiced politics “the right way.” Coates had published a rejoinder in Vanity Fair, pointing out that Kirk had “reveled in open bigotry.” Their tête-à-tête on Klein’s show, staged at a bare-bones studio table, added a human component to their battle of ideas. Coates looked visibly taken aback as he discussed Klein’s choice not to call out Kirk’s hateful ideology, and supportive viewers turned his skeptical face into a kind of reaction meme. Klein’s more placid affect, meanwhile, did little to absolve him of critiques of political abstraction and whitewashing. In the video-podcast era, those best able to project their authenticity through the small screen win—and it’s not always the people who film themselves the most often.\nAs the internet’s content-distribution channels become overwhelmingly cluttered with spam, misinformation, and A.I.-generated slop and propaganda, video podcasts have the considerable advantage of serving as markers of reality, at least for now. Viewers are reassured to see a voice coming directly out of a face, and a conversation documented for a stretch of time that would seem difficult to fake. ChatGPT can blandly spit out infinite facts, but individual eloquence is still in limited supply. What’s unclear is whether the video-podcast format can sustain the explosion of entrants as more talking heads in journalism, politics, entertainment, and tech jockey for attention in a digital landscape already beset by chronic distraction. In the past few months alone, we’ve seen the arrival of new video podcasts from Emily Sundberg’s buzzy New York City newsletter “Feed Me”; the sports agent Rich Paul and the ESPN commentator Max Kellerman, under the umbrella of The Ringer; the comedian Ilana Glazer; and PBS. (The New Yorker is not immune from the trend: it now films some episodes of The New Yorker Radio Hour.) Least expected, perhaps, was the launch of “The Liz Truss Show,” hosted by the former British Prime Minister, on YouTube. Truss’s time in office lasted all of six weeks, but, with a clip-on microphone and a wonkish backdrop, perhaps she can gin up a new kind of following, one videotaped chat at a time. ♦","summary":"Whether you’re a pundit, a politician, or an A-list comedian, the best media strategy these days is a D.I.Y. stage set and a microphone.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/why-video-podcasts-multiplied-beyond-the-man-cave","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6938aacbf24a4b29fd17babc/16:9/w_2800,h_1575,c_limit/NewYorker_podcasts_final%20.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 18:27:33","author":"Kyle Chayka","authors":["Kyle Chayka"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.06},{"id":386903004,"title":"This High-Profile Race Shows Exactly What Has Changed In The Democratic Party","text":"WASHINGTON — There’s plenty of reason to be skeptical of Rep. Jasmine Crockett’s chances in Texas’ U.S. Senate race. While Crockett’s television hits and podcast interviews delight liberals, she’s only ever won in safely Democratic seats. Her preferred strategy of focusing on increasing base voter turnout has little track record of success. Republicans are openly ecstatic about her decision. \n\nBut if Democratic elected officials share this skepticism, they’re unwilling to say it out loud. They’re also not willing to fully back her campaign or endorse her over her primary opponent, state Rep. James Talarico. \n\n“It’s entirely possible that she can put together a good campaign,” said Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.).\n\n“She’s an outstanding person and an important voice in her state,” added Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.).\n\n“I’m obviously focused on the House, not the Senate,” said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), declining to speak on the ambitions of one of the most high-profile members of his caucus.\n\nUncertainty about the utility of Crockett’s bid extended even to Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), one of the members of the so-called “Fight Club” group of progressive senators pushing for a more aggressive approach to combating Donald Trump.\n\n“There are some places where the primaries are good, and there are places where they can be a pain in the ass,” Murphy told HuffPost. “A primary can, you know, ultimately cause a lot of new people to register and cause a lot of new people to get involved.”\n\nThe wishy-washiness greeting Crockett is reflective of the party’s uncertainty about how to navigate the anti-Trump, anti-establishment energy coursing through the party, which closely mirrors the GOP’s crack-up in the first half of the 2010s. Democrats are hoping to mirror the incredibly strong midterm election performances Republicans had in those years.\n\nBut they are hoping to avoid the downsides the GOP experienced in those years: Primary voters repeatedly picking weak candidates who handed winnable elections to the opposition. The consensus among party operatives is Crockett is the Democratic equivalent of Christine O’Donnell or Richard Mourdock, a candidate whose fighting spirit animates the party’s base but whose rhetoric — like Crockett saying conservatives are “inherently violent” or suggesting Latino Trump supporters have a “slave mentality” — repels swing voters. \n\n“This feels like a Democratic tea party moment,” said Adam Carlson, founder of the Democratic polling firm Zenith Research. “Democratic primary voters are tired of having candidates dictated to them, and they’re saying, ‘Stop telling us who’s electable. We’re going to vote for who we like the best.’” \n\nThe party’s establishment has long succeeded at closely managing primaries. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), known as a ferocious recruiter, was also adept at subtly and not-so-subtly discouraging candidacies, helping the party avoid contentious primaries in Florida and Kansas in recent years. \n\nAnd voters largely went along with party leaders’ wishes. In the first midterm under Trump, wins by insurgent progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) were the exception rather than the rule, with voters — especially in swing states and districts — backing moderate candidates seen as safe choices to win. That trend largely continued through the 2020, 2022 and 2024 elections. \n\nDemocrats in those elections often benefited from anti-Trump energy, and clear cases of the party picking the wrong nominee were few, far between and often limited to lower-stakes races for the U.S. House. But some party operatives fear they could be far more common this cycle.\n\nSen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) indirectly compared Crockett to Aftyn Behn, the Tennessee state legislator whose liberal stances and controversial social media posts some Democrats blamed for blowing the party’s shot at a deep-red House seat earlier this month.\n\n“I do know that Texas is red, and then I do know that you have to bring some people over to the other side,” Fetterman told HuffPost. “And now, what happened in Tennessee? You know, we had that total train wreck on our side, and that could have been actually really, truly competitive if it was like a more reasonable kind of a candidate.”\n\nCrockett’s entrance into the race seemingly forced former Rep. Colin Allred, potentially a much stronger candidate, to challenge Rep. Julie Johnson for a safe Democratic House seat instead. Allred ran 6 percentage points ahead of former Vice President Kamala Harris in the state when he challenged Sen. Ted Cruz last cycle.\n\nAllred’s team portrayed his decision, which leaves Talarico as Crockett’s only competition in the primary, as a selfless one that would give the party’s nominee a 13-week head start in the general election by avoiding a runoff, which is a near certainty in the GOP primary between incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt. (Texas requires runoffs in primaries if no candidate breaks 50% of the vote.)\n\nBut as the likelihood of Crockett running for Senate became clear in recent weeks, Democrats in the state couldn’t find anyone willing to discourage her. Senate Democrats do not yet view Texas, an ultra-expensive state that might only be competitive if Cornyn loses to the deeply conservative and ethically challenged Paxton, as an essential part of their pathway to the majority. \n\nEven if they had, Crockett, to put it lightly, does not seem to be the type swayed by the pleas of party elders. \n\n“It’s weird that people believe that I could win the races that I won and I’m just like out here willy-nilly,” she told CNN last week before officially announcing her decision. “But OK. I am very self-aware, right?”\n\nWith Allred out of the race, it is now a showdown between Crockett and Talarico, widely seen as another rising star in the party and someone who has amassed a $5 million war chest since entering the race this summer, according to the Federal Election Commission filings from October. (Crockett has roughly $4.6 million in her account.) \n\nCrockett’s unelectability, in the eyes of most Democratic operatives, comes down to both her insistence on turning out Democratic base voters at the expense of persuasion and her tendency to actively insult Trump voters.\n\n“There just aren’t enough Democrats to win using a base-heavy strategy in Texas,” Carlson said.\n\nThe other concern Democrats have about Crockett is, as one strategist put it, her “robust self-image.” Her campaign announcement did not include any mention of policies or voter concerns; it was a video of herself with audio of Trump insulting her. Early on in her kickoff speech, Crockett said she was running because “what we need is for me to have a bigger voice.” \n\nCrockett’s campaign did not respond to an email requesting comment. During an appearance on CNN on Monday night, Crockett went further than previously in suggesting she would reach out to some Trump voters. \n\n“We are going to be able to get people that potentially have voted for Trump even though I, obviously, am one of his loudest opponents because at the end of the day, they vote for who they believe is fighting for them,” she told host Laura Coates.\n\nBut she reiterated her top priority would be turning out otherwise apathetic voters, a strategy even many other progressives have backed away from. “Our goal is to make sure that we can engage people that historically have not been talked to because there are so many people that get ignored, specifically in the state of Texas,” she said. “Listen, the state of Texas is 61% people of color. We have a lot of good folk that we can talk to.”\n\nOne Democrat working for a House campaign in Texas’ heavily Latino Rio Grande Valley — an area that has swung sharply to Republicans over the past decade — noted Crockett’s announcement video included no mention of the high cost of living, a message the party has used to successfully win back Latino voters elsewhere in elections this year.\n\n“It’s simply not the message these voters are looking for,” said the operative, who requested anonymity to speak frankly because his candidate is neutral in the Senate primary. “People here are worried about a downballot bloodbath.” \n\nWhile Crockett has an advantage in name identification and starts out in the lead, Democrats watching the race say she also has uniquely high unfavorable ratings, even among members of her own party. Talarico allies hope a closer look at Crockett’s record — including her past support for Israel, her ties to the cryptocurrency industry and her acceptance of corporate political action committee money — rather than just her TV appearances, will convince the party’s voters Talarico gives them the best chance of winning statewide in Texas for the first time in 30 years. \n\n“We’re building a movement in Texas — fueled by record-breaking grassroots fundraising and 10,000 volunteers who are putting in the work to defeat the billionaire mega-donors and puppet politicians who have taken over our state,” Talarico said in a statement after Crockett’s entrance into the race. “Our movement is rooted in unity over division — so we welcome Congresswoman Crockett into this race.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/texas-senate-race-democratic-party_n_6939989de4b0758c1aff338e?origin=home-whats-happening-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/69399929190000caf87f3c31.jpeg?cache=cdWWm9a14L&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 18:19:43","author":"Igor Bobic,Kevin Robillard","authors":["Igor Bobic","Kevin Robillard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.129},{"id":386974102,"title":"Mike Johnson Finally Reveals GOP’s Health Care Plan—and It’s Rough","text":"“Lemme tell ya.

It didn’t work in Miami","text":"Donald Trump wants to help Republicans by putting himself front and center in next year’s midterm elections.\n\nHe tried it in the race for Miami mayor and it didn’t work.\n\nThe candidate Trump endorsed in the race, Republican Emilio González, lost by nearly 20 points to Democrat Eileen Higgins Tuesday in a city Kamala Harris barely won last year, and became the city’s first Democratic mayor in three decades.\n\n“For the president to weigh in on a local race like this and to lose is embarrassing,” anti-Trump Republican political consultant Mike Madrid said.\n\nThe surge of support in Miami for a Democratic candidate could be a harbinger of what’s to come next year when voters decide which party will control Congress — and Trump’s involvement didn’t stem the tide of Republican losses that began in New Jersey and Virginia last month.\n\nAfter those losses, Trump’s midterm strategy is to get more involved. He plans to endorse Republicans in races that presidents don’t normally weigh in on, according to his chief of staff Susie Wiles.\n\n“Typically in the midterms, it’s not about who’s sitting in the White House. You localize the election and you keep the federal officials out of it. We’re actually going to turn that on its head and put him on the ballot,” Wiles said in an interview released Monday by an online show called The Mom View.\n\nWiles, a longtime Florida Republican political consultant and lobbyist, pointed to last month’s Republican losses elsewhere in the country as evidence of “what happens when he’s not on the ballot and not active.”\n\n“He’s going to campaign like it’s 2024 again,” she added. “He doesn’t help everybody, but for those he does, he’s a difference maker.”\n\nOn Tuesday night, however, Trump put himself on the Miami ballot and it didn’t make a clear difference: Higgins garnered 59% of the vote Tuesday to González’ 41%.\n\nFor Democrats, Tuesday’s results are exactly the type of win against a Trump-endorsed candidate they hope to replicate during the regular election cycle next year.\n\n“Mayor-elect Eileen Higgins’ win is a testament to what Democrats can accomplish when we organize and compete everywhere, including in Miami,” DNC chair Ken Martin said Tuesday night.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee pointed to it as a warning sign to Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, who has recently been openly critical of Trump and called his latest immigration crackdown “un-American.”\n\n“Tonight’s victory proves yet again that Democrats are on offense in some of the most competitive political terrain in the country as we continue to expand the battlefield,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Madison Andrus echoed.\n\nLongtime Florida Democratic consultant Steve Schale said Higgins’ win is clearly not an indicator “Florida is back in play” for Democrats, but he said the significance of Democrats winning a mayoral seat in Miami can’t be written off as simply an off-year result.\n\n“Her winning is a bigger deal than what happened in New York City,” he said, pointing to Zohran Mamdani’s win over Trump-endorsed Andrew Cuomo.\n\nHe also took a long-term view, harkening back to Florida mayoral wins two decades ago that proved to be an early sign of Florida becoming more competitive ahead of Barack Obama winning Florida in 2008.\n\n“Florida looked really uncompetitive after the 2004 presidential election. We had a governor’s race decided by a dozen points. We had a presidential race that wasn’t close,” Schale said. “The first sign that showed that Florida was potentially reverting back to the mean of being a little bit more competitive was a number of mayor’s races in 2005.”\n\nFor Democrats, building back a beleaguered party against a Republican party that holds every statewide office and holds a supermajority in the state Legislature is a massive lift that one December election is unlikely to change. But Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried hopes the win will start to convince national investors not to write Florida off as permanently red.\n\n“How can the rest of the nation not wake up and see that we are making progress?” Fried told the Herald ahead of Election Day.\n\nRepublicans minimize the loss\n\nSome Florida Republicans insisted that Higgins’ win wasn’t a referendum on Trump and that instead, Trump’s presence in the race wasn’t emphasized enough. Trump’s endorsements were limited to social media posts, not a visit or robocalls, and came after Higgins placed well ahead of González and 12 other candidates during the Nov. 4 general election.\n\n“I actually think [Wiles] has the right formula. Where it failed this time for Miami was that we didn’t push Trump enough,” Miami Republican Executive Committeewoman Angie Wong told the Herald Tuesday night. “I think the messaging was lost in Miami that we had a Trump-endorsed candidate.”\n\nGonzález downplayed the partisan framing of the race — a contest that had both campaigns sending mailers highlighting Trump’s endorsement of González. One Florida Democratic Party mailer told voters to “send a clear message: Trump’s endorsement will be rejected in Miami.”\n\n“I wanted this to be a municipal race,” he said at his Election Night party in downtown Miami about 30 minutes before the results came in. “I wanted this to be about Miami.”\n\nThe Republican – who called Higgins a “soft socialist” on the campaign trail – insisted he was also courting Democrats throughout the campaign, and wouldn’t have minded some high-profile Democratic support, too. He was up against a 8,800 Democratic voter registration advantage in the race.\n\n“Hell, I’ll take Biden’s endorsement,” he said of the former president, the one candidate to beat Trump in an election. “When you get endorsed by a president, that means a lot.”\n\nGonzález said he thought the president’s backing galvanized Republicans during the runoff and boosted his party’s motivation to vote. While Democrats cast about 1,200 fewer ballots in the runoff than they did in the first-round election last month, Republicans cast about 1,200 more than they did in November. “More Republicans turned up,” González said.\n\nBoth candidates emphasized local issues throughout their campaign, with a focus on rejecting corruption and bringing integrity and honesty to city hall.\n\nLeading up to election day, Republicans lowered expectations for a win. Despite Trump’s endorsement in the race, Florida GOP chair Evan Power called Miami a “Kamala district.”\n\n“We’re fighting there because we’re fighting everywhere,” he said Monday.\n\nDemocrats have typically won the city in major elections and lead in voter registration, even though they haven’t held the mayoral seat since the late 1990s. Manny Diaz, mayor from 2001 to 2009, went on years later to be chairman of the Florida Democratic Party, but renounced his affiliation with the party prior to his first election.\n\nMiami Dade GOP Chairman Kevin Cooper cautioned people from making too much of the results.\n\n“The unfortunate result of one campaign,” he said, “is not the unfortunate result of an agenda or of a party.”\n\nMiami Herald staff writers Doug Hanks and Tess Riski contributed to this report.\n\nThis story was originally published December 10, 2025 at 12:32 PM.","url":"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article313579467.html","image":"https://www.miamiherald.com/public/latest-news/e08cjs/picture312795392/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/MIA_42TRUMPAMERICABUSINESSFORUM.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 17:32:01","author":"Claire Heddles","authors":["Claire Heddles"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":386974108,"title":"Federal Judge Orders Trump to Get Troops Out of Los Angeles ASAP","text":"“Lemme tell ya.

He's in the country illegally, for starters, but it gets worse than that; Saucedo-Portillo is a registered sex offender, with at least one conviction for driving while impaired. So, not exactly an Eagle Scout.\n\nBut when Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) tried to pick Saucedo-Portillo up on the campus of Augsburg University, a small private college in Minneapolis, where he was unaccountably taking classes despite being in the country illegally, a school administrator and - get this - campus security tried to stop them.\n\nThat's right. A school administrator and the campus security apparatus tried to stop the legal arrest of an illegal alien and convicted criminal.\n\nOn Monday night, DHS, responding to a local news report, said on X that ICE agents arrested Jesus Saucedo-Portillo, a criminal illegal alien and registered sex offender with a prior conviction for driving while impaired.That arrest was hindered when a school administrator teamed up with campus security and attempted to prevent ICE agents from doing their job.Saucedo-Portillo is an undergraduate student at Augsburg University in Minneapolis.\n\nNot anymore, he isn't. Is it belaboring the obvious to note that this guy could have actually posed a danger to the students of Augsburg University?\n\n\"Our officers told the school Administrator and campus security that ICE had a warrant for the illegal alien's arrest. The school Administrator told ICE officers they were violating university policies,\" the statement said. \"Our officers informed them that federal law supersedes any University policy and that if campus security would not stop blocking the law enforcement vehicle from exiting, they would be obstructing justice.\"Despite the warning, the administrator refused to back down and ordered campus security to block the ICE vehicle, according to DHS.\"Our officers followed their training to use the minimum amount of force necessary to clear the area and successfully arrested this criminal illegal alien,\" the statement finished.In an interview with Minnesota Public Radio, Augsburg President Paul Pribbenow corroborated that Saucedo-Portillo is a student and claimed that the arrest was \"illegal\" and that ICE did not have a warrant.\n\nThe officers were correct. ICE is under no obligation to give any consideration to the university's policies. Augsburg University can pass all the policies they like, they can define pi as 3 and insist that the stars are the lights of the heavens shining through holes in the celestial spheres for all they like, and that won't change the facts on the ground, that being that federal law that enables ICE to do their jobs supersedes anything they decree. The arrest wasn't illegal, just because this turbocharged son of a vacuum-cleaner salesman says so, in total disregard for the safety and well-being of his students.\n\nRead More: ICE Strikes Back: Dangerous Illegals Nabbed in New Minneapolis Sweep\n\nYou can't even parody these people. They are already beyond that.\n\nHere's the thing: If this same, exact action were taken during, say, the Obama administration, it's a near-certainty that Paul Pribbenow wouldn't have offered a peep in reply. And the Obama administration was, to be fair, no slouch in kicking illegals out of our country. So, where were the leftist protests then? Where were the useful idiots setting fire to cars and waving Mexican flags? \n\nThis isn't about the illegal aliens. It's not about immigration law. It's about Trump Derangement Syndrome, pure and simple. If Kamala Harris had won the 2024 election, and we should be grateful every waking moment that she didn't, and if she had implemented this exact crackdown on illegal immigration, the left would have not only ignored it - they almost certainly would have celebrated it. Augsburg University would have handed this guy over on a silver platter.\n\nAugsburg officials did not return multiple requests for comment.\n\nYou don't say.\n\nEditor’s Note: Thanks to President Trump, illegal immigration into our great country has virtually stopped.

While a portion of the online discourse it provoked was centered around whether or not the album was actually good, a parallel wave of attacks accused Swift and the album of promoting ultra-right-wing ideology.\n\nUsers across platforms claimed that the song “Wi$h Li$t,” in which Swift sings about her only wish being to settle down, was an implicit endorsement of MAGA values, even though the singer had publicly endorsed Trump’s opponent, former vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election. Some even claimed that a line in the song, in which Swift sings “have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you” in reference to her fiancé, football player Travis Kelce, had white supremacist connotations.\n\nAccounts also claimed that the lines “I’m not a bad bitch, and this isn’t savage” in the song “Eldest Daughter” and “sleepless in the onyx night, but now, the sky is opalite” from the song “Opalite” were racist digs at Kelce’s ex-girlfriend, who is black.\n\nOther posts even claimed that a necklace merch with lightning bolts on it was actually a Nazi dog-whistle for vaguely resembling “SS.”\n\nNow, according to new research from behavioral intelligence startup GUDEA, at least a good chunk of these online attacks were spurred by inauthentic social media accounts in what looks to be a coordinated attack on Swift’s reputation.\n\nGUDEA examined thousands of posts from 18,000 accounts across 14 social media platforms made in the first two weeks following the album’s release, to find that the “Taylor Swift is a Nazi” narrative was spurred by accounts that behaved like bots. The inauthentic narrative acted as a catalyst for authentic conversations, like one comparing Swift to self-proclaimed Nazi Kanye West.\n\nSurprisingly, though, it was the Swifties that inadvertently ensured that the attacks reached their intended impact. These false narratives were basically “rage bait” designed to provoke real users and strengthen the narrative’s visibility. So ultimately, it was established accounts and influencers that took the false narrative from the confines of the fringe corners of the internet to the mainstream conversation.

She is the first woman to serve as vice president, and., and she still defaults to acting as if every question is part of a deposition where answers can and will be used against her.\n\nUNLEASHED! LAWYERLY LANGUAGE REMAINS HER SAFE SPACE\n\nI guess that's how toney, lickspittle NYT reporters describe what we knuckle-draggers commonly called Kamala's 'word salad.'\n\nThey then thoughtfully provide an example of the former vice president's lawyerly language.\n\n...She has mostly been a bystander in the Democratic Party’s raging debate over its direction. Should Democrats veer to the left or center? More populism? More progressivism? Both? Neither? What exactly should the party stand for?\n\nGracious. That was deep.\n\nDeep but truly authentic Kamala word salad - yup.\n\nHarris is thrilled people are paying good money to line up and hear her word salads on this tour, and the Times points out only one other Democrat has had the drawing power in national tours that Harris enjoys - Bernie Sanders.\n\n She believes there should be a bust of her in Congress.\n\n...Ms. Harris has made clear she doesn’t “feel burdened” — yes, she still uses that phrase — by where she fits in the punditry pecking order or the polls or the cable chyrons. She is enjoying the freedom from what she calls the “transactional” constrictions of campaigning, of asking people for a vote.Her place in history is already secure, and she knows it.“I understand the focus on ’28 and all that,” she said in the interview. “\n\nHer sense of her own place in history is so secure that Harris even called the newly elected mayor of New York to advise him on how to fill his team and be an effective executive, having been so effective herself at every opportunity.\n\n.“,” she said of Mr. Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, praising the excitement he has generated from younger voters.\n\nThe NYT authors don't point out that pinning down what exactly Harris's 'ideology' is is difficult thanks to her utter vacuousness and vapidity.\n\nAgain, they redefine Harris's space-cadet-like delivery and vagueness as 'elusive.' Isn't that a much prettier word?\n\nDamn near makes a questionable intellect mysterious instead of laughable.\n\nIn public and in private, she has been exploring issues of trust, misinformation, social media, community and artificial intelligence. She is particularly obsessed with young people and their growing disillusionment, which she shares.“,” she told Stephen Colbert in her first interview about her book. “”\n\nI believe Kamala Harris owes a portion of the $7M she made selling her email list to the DNC to these two reporters for the tongue bath.\n\nIs the country ready for a run at Word Salad Redux? You'll note I'm not asking if we want one - we won't have much choice if Democrats don't have much choice.\n\nStu Burguiere, discussing the article with Megyn Kelly - who howls over the 'historic' figure conceit - contrasts Harris's style (lawyerly, don't forget) with Jasmine Crocker, who blurts out every word the second it pops into her head.\n\nHarris, he says, is trying to do the exact opposite, just 'trying to survive, because she's not quick enough on her feet to come up with a real answer.'\n\nFor the moment, Harris is playing coy Hillary Clinton word games, and having surrogates make sure they use the terms 'white boys.'\n\n...Black voters, particularly in the South, have swung the party’s last two open presidential nominating contests. Ms. Harris has made a point of traveling through the South on her book tour. Her stop in Birmingham, Ala., was so popular that the venue added a second event.“” said Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina legislator who has been an informal Harris adviser, referring to the governors of Pennsylvania and California and to Mr. Buttigieg, the former transportation secretary. “She is so important to so many people.”At the Ryman, \n\nGavin Newsom's name does pop up towards the end of the article.\n\nA 'very talented' California rival\n\nThat has to sting a smidge as does the recounting of the Newsom anecdote from Harris' book, where she'd called to ask for his endorsement and got a 'Hiking. Will call back' text. She says she never heard from him again, even though Newsom did quickly endorse her.\n\nWhy so catty in the book, then - Newsom wanted to know, too. So he says he asked her.\n\n...Mr. Newsom has questioned why the episode was included, given that he endorsed her so quickly. He texted Ms. Harris to ask her this after her book came out, he recounted recently to a video game streamer.“Anyway,” Mr. Newsom said with a laugh, “that’s the relationship.”\n\nThe love letter to the Word Salad Queen ends as love letters do - with a swoon over Harris' heroics.\n\nThe authors recount Harris's visit to Tennessee to support young legislators there who were being censured for disrupting the session with their antics while encouraging protestors storming the Capitol.\n\n....Ms. Harris, however, has a correction to that timeline.\n\nCan't you hear that in your head in that nasal delivery of hers?\n\n600K copies of her book have been sold, and venues have been packed for her appearances. This has to be tickling the ambitious fantasies of her 'very talented' California rival, who, coincidentally, has announced the release of a no doubt riveting memoir of his own next year.\n\nWhat a novel approach.\n\nAnd who, somehow, is enjoying an inexplicable tick-up in popularity at the moment that defies reality on the ground.\n\n amid rumors he could run for the Democratic nomination in 2028.The governor’s willingness to battle the president has made his popularity soar, with a new poll finding that Newsom’s overall approval rating is now at 56%, a 10% jump since June. Among Democrats in California, his approval rating is 82%., fueling new speculation about a 2028 presidential run.\n\nAnd Gavin Newsom promises pathos, having been born the poor child of black sharecroppers...or something close.\n\n...“” Newsom said in the announcement.The book release comes as Newsom is seeing a bump in approval after his attacks on Trump on social media, his forceful pushback against immigration raids and his successful November campaign for Prop 50, which allowed redistricting in California to counter Republican redistricting in other states.\n\nJust another proof point @GavinNewsom had the best 2025 of the 2028ers. Period. https://t.co/MVUaoatk8z— dan turrentine (@danturrentine) December 9, 2025\n\nI could swear this sticky Randall Flagg Lite wannabe was THE WORST if I didn't remember I'd just written 500 words or so about Kamala Harris right above that.\n\nAlthough I will give greasy Gavin the edge because he's actually been in charge of something and done nothing but botch it horribly for so long. Anything Harris was ever 'in charge of,' even as Attorney General, had other people doing the work for her (they never did find any trial transcripts where she was the lead attorney, I don't believe).

During an interview on “The Lead with Jake Tapper,” Crockett denied saying they all have “slave mentality” and argued most of them likely do not support what Trump is doing.\n\n“‘The immigration thing has always been something that has perplexed me about this community … It almost reminds me of what people would talk about when they would talk about kind of like slave mentality and the hate that some slaves would have for themselves. It’s almost like a slave mentality that they have. Now about the time that that was published last year, around a million Latino voters in Texas were voting for Trump,'” Crockett told Vanity Fair. (RELATED: Jasmine Crockett’s Senate Campaign Going As Well As You’d Expect)\n\nAfter reading the quote, Tapper pointed out that a record-high number of Latinos voted for Trump.\n\n“Now about the time that that was published last year, around a million Latino voters in Texas were voting for Trump. Do they all have slave mentality?” Tapper asked. \n\n“No, and that’s not what that said at all, to be clear. It did not say that every Latino has that type of mentality,” Crockett said. “No, no, but slave, the ones that vote for people who believe in strong or Trump’s immigration policy. So, so I don’t believe that the people that voted for Trump believe in what they’re actually getting.” \n\nTrump achieved the highest share of the Latino vote ever recorded for a Republican nominee, winning approximately 46% to 48% in the 2024 election. He won the Latino male vote 54% to 44% against former Vice President Kamala Harris, according to an NBC News exit poll.\n\nCrockett launched her Senate campaign on Monday and claimed she can flip Texas blue.

The CBS Mornings co-host is now boarding CBS Evening News as the program's new anchor, the network announced on Wednesday, Dec. 10.\n\n Dokoupil, 44, will anchor his first broadcast on Monday, Jan. 5, 2026 amid one of the first major lineup changes under editor-in-chief Bari Weiss. The TV journalist has co-hosted CBS Mornings alongside Gayle King and Nate Burleson since 2019 after joining CBS News in 2016.\n\n “After 20 years in journalism, traveling through all 50 states and talking with people in hundreds of far-flung American places, I realize why a country this big needs a show this ambitious,” Dokoupil said in a statement.\n\n He added, “The strength of our nation is that we benefit from fair reporting and the open discussion of all ideas. For more than 60 years, the Evening News has been a bedrock of that process. I’m honored to join a fearless team at this important moment, and with what I can promise is a commitment to trust and the plain truth.”\n\n CBS Mornings also shared the news on Wednesday, with Dokoupil telling King, 70, Burleson, 44, and Vladimir Duthiers that it’s “an amazing thing to say.” He added, “It’s been almost seven years that we’ve been doing this together and I am not joking that this has been the best job I have ever had in journalism. If things didn’t change around us, I would never change this.”\n\n “Until next year!” King quipped in response. She also noted that their co-host will remain on the program for the rest of the week.\n\n In her own statement shared by CBS News, Weiss, 41, called the new anchor \"the person to win\" back viewers' \"trust in the media,\" citing his \"old-school journalistic values.\" Saying that Dokoupil \"is what everyone wants in an evening-news anchor,\" CBS News president Tom Cibrowski added that he was \"authentic, compassionate [and] unafraid.\"\n\n The hire makes Dokoupil the sixth anchor of the broadcast in the last decade, following Scott Pelley, Jeff Glor, Norah O’Donnell, John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois, who announced his CBS Morning News exit on Thursday, Dec. 4 less than a year after taking over with Dickerson, 57. Dickerson announced his exit from CBS in October after 16 years.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n It was also announced that Matt Gutman has been named CBS News chief correspondent, with the former ABC News journalist set to start on the same days as Dokoupil.\n\n Gutman, 48, will report for CBS Mornings and CBS Evening News, where he will serve as a fill-in anchor for the broadcast. Additionally, he will also serve as a lead correspondent for 48 Hours and is slated to contribute to 60 Minutes. \n\n The staffing switch-up comes amid several changes at CBS News following Skydance’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount, CBS' parent company. The merger came after CBS News settled a lawsuit with President Donald Trump, who accused 60 Minutes of deceptively editing former Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 campaign trail appearance on the show.\n\n Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to the president's future presidential library. Initially, the lawsuit sought $10 billion in damages, and led to concerns over the precedent Paramount would set for media companies by giving into Trump's demands.\n\n Also in October, Weiss, best known for running the opinion website The Free Press, was named editor in chief of CBS News, despite having no experience running a news organization the size of CBS.\n\n “Tony’s superpower is listening to people. We want to serve Americans in the best way possible by meeting them where they are every night — and we’ll do that with this cross-country kick-off tour,” CBS Evening News executive producer Kim Harvey said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n She added, “Tony knows what makes this country great and what challenges we face.

González, en unos comicios municipales que, pese a ser oficialmente no partidistas, se desarrollaron bajo la intensa sombra de la política nacional.Higgins se convierte así en la primera mujer y la primera persona no hispana en llegar a la Alcaldía de Miami, además de la primera demócrata elegida en 24 años para gobernar el municipio, históricamente dominado por republicanos cubanoamericanos, en un duro revés al partido del presidente Donald Trump.La demócrata, excomisionada del condado de 61 años, derrotó a González, de 68, quien había recibido el respaldo de Trump y del gobernador de Florida, Ron DeSantis, y logró 40,5% de los votos.\n\n“Esta noche, la gente de Miami hizo historia. Juntos dejamos atrás años de caos y corrupción y abrimos la puerta a una nueva etapa para nuestra ciudad – una marcada por liderazgo ético, responsable y enfocado en resultados reales para nuestra gente”, señaló Higging en un comunicado tras conocersen los resultados preliminares.La contienda atrajo atención nacional tras el intento republicano por extender a la ciudad de Miami el dominio electoral que consolidaron en 2024, cuando Trump ganó sorpresivamente el condado Miami-Dade por más de diez puntos frente a Kamala Harris.\n\nPara los demócratas, la victoria de Higgins representa un impulso simbólico y estratégico. El Comité Nacional Demócrata había concentrado esfuerzos en su campaña, y el senador Rubén Gallego viajó a Miami el fin de semana para respaldarla, en un momento en que el partido busca recuperar terreno en Florida tras años de retrocesos.La elección, sin embargo, se desarrolló en un contexto local complejo. Aunque el condado Miami-Dade se movió claramente hacia los republicanos en 2024, algunos reportes indican que en la ciudad de Miami Harris ganó por un margen mínimo, haciendo de esta contienda un termómetro clave para medir la capacidad demócrata de reconectar con un electorado cambiante.\n\nLa ciudad de Miami, con cerca de medio millón de habitantes, tiene una población hispana que ronda el 70 %.Higgins basó su campaña en enfrentar el aumento del costo de vida, mejorar los servicios municipales y reforzar la transparencia del gobierno local.En contraste, González, coronel retirado de la Fuerza Aérea y exdirector de Servicios de Ciudadanía e Inmigración de Estados Unidos (USCIS), centró su mensaje en seguridad pública, crecimiento económico y preparación ante emergencias, apoyado en su experiencia militar y administrativa.\n\nAmbos candidatos también reflejaron visiones opuestas sobre migración. González defendió las estrictas medidas del Gobierno de Trump, que en semanas recientes impuso nuevas restricciones para solicitar la ciudadanía a cubanos y venezolanos. Higgins calificó esas políticas de “inmorales”.La segunda vuelta se convocó después de que ninguno alcanzara más de 50% en las elecciones del 4 de noviembre, cuando Higgins obtuvo el 36 % de los votos y González 19%.\n\n History in Miami elections: a woman, a non-Hispanic candidate, and a Democrat was elected\n\n(LPL) – Democrat Eileen Higgins became Miami’s new mayor on Tuesday with nearly 60% of the vote after defeating Republican Emilio T. González in the runoff election. Despite being officially nonpartisan, the municipal elections were heavily influenced by national politics.\n\nHiggins thus becomes the first woman and the first non-Hispanic person elected mayor of Miami, as well as the first Democrat elected in 24 years to govern the city, historically dominated by Cuban-American Republicans. This represents a significant setback for President Donald Trump’s party.\n\nThe 61-year-old Democrat, a former county commissioner, defeated González, 68, who had received the backing of Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, and garnered 40.5% of the vote.\n\n“Tonight, the people of Miami made history. Together, we left behind years of chaos and corruption and opened the door to a new era for our city—one marked by ethical, responsible leadership focused on real results for our people,” Higgins said in a statement after the preliminary results were announced.\n\nThe race attracted national attention following the Republican attempt to extend to the city of Miami the electoral dominance they consolidated in 2024, when Trump surprisingly won Miami-Dade County by more than ten points against Kamala Harris.\n\nFor Democrats, Higgins’ victory represents a symbolic and strategic boost. The Democratic National Committee had focused its efforts on her campaign, and Senator Rubén Gallego traveled to Miami over the weekend to support her, at a time when the party is seeking to regain ground in Florida after years of setbacks.\n\nThe election, however, unfolded against a complex local backdrop. Although Miami-Dade County clearly shifted to Republicans in 2024, some reports indicate that Harris won the Miami mayoral race by a narrow margin, making this contest a key barometer for gauging the Democratic Party’s ability to reconnect with a shifting electorate.\n\nThe city of Miami, with nearly half a million residents, has a Hispanic population of around 70%. Higgins based his campaign on addressing the rising cost of living, improving municipal services, and strengthening local government transparency.\n\nIn contrast, González, a retired Air Force colonel and former director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), focused his message on public safety, economic growth, and emergency preparedness, drawing on his military and administrative experience.\n\nBoth candidates also reflected opposing views on immigration. González defended the Trump administration’s strict measures, which in recent weeks imposed new restrictions on citizenship applications for Cubans and Venezuelans. Higgins called these policies “immoral.”\n\nThe second round was called after no candidate received more than 50% of the vote in the November 4 election, when Higgins won 36% of the vote and González 19%.","summary":"(LPL/EN) &#8211; La demócrata Eileen Higgins se convirtió el martes en la nueva alcaldesa de Miami con cerca de 60% de los votos tras imponerse en la segunda vuelta al republicano Emilio T.

Inflation, however, remains above the Fed's 2% target at 3%.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump's administration has removed tariffs from dozens of food products and touted its rollback of fuel efficiency standards and Trump-branded retirement accounts for children as cost-of-living fixes.\n\nIn an excerpt from an interview with Politico released on Tuesday, Trump was asked what grade he would give the economy.\n\n\"A plus-plus-plus-plus-plus,\" he said.\n\nIn a sign the policy pivot might be cutting through, Trump's approval rating rose three points to 41% in a new Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nBut many Americans remain downbeat over the economy.\n\nAlaina Hunt, 37, told the BBC she lost her job in April as a designer at a construction company in Oklahoma City, partly because of Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminium.\n\nThe construction sector \"really took a hard hit very early on\", she said, adding that she had applied for at least 75 jobs to no avail.\n\nShe said that rising grocery bills - about $25 extra per week - had added to the strain.\n\n\"I was able to scrape by a lot easier in years before,\" said Ms Hunt, who voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024. \"I don't think that the federal government is listening at all.\"\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, was sceptical of Trump's messaging on the economy. He told CBS News that the president's view \"does not reflect the reality on the ground here in a community where many Pennsylvanians voted for him in the last election\".\n\nCiting issues such such as trade tariffs, Shapiro continued: \"The record is clear: his policies have hurt the very communities that propelled him to the White House.\"\n\nThe economic data itself paints a mixed picture.\n\nUS consumer confidence fell in November to its lowest level since the spring.\n\nBut the stock market continues to hover near record highs. And forecasters expect the economy to expand by 1.9% this year, slower than last year's 2.8% but still better than expected.\n\nSome recent data also indicates the job market may be picking up, after a significant hiring slowdown earlier this year.\n\nAt the rally, Trump said \"prices are coming down tremendously from the highest prices in the history of our country.\"\n\nBut prices are not falling - which is disinflation - rather, prices are rising at a slower rate.\n\nAs of September, inflation stood at 3%, the same rate as in January when the president took office and stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.\n\nIt is still way below a peak of 9.1% under former President Joe Biden when the US faced its worst inflation in four decades.\n\nOverall prices have surged 25% over the last five years, generating widespread frustration, despite wage growth over that period.\n\nBeth Richardson, a 45-year-old from Kansas, said she had been floored by some of the prices at the grocery store near her, recalling a pack of Mentos gum she picked up recently that rang up to almost $5 with tax.\n\n\"I'm like, I'm just going to go die now because this cannot be,\" she said.\n\nMs Richardson was laid off from her job in sales support at a tech-related company in late 2023, after the firm shifted jobs overseas. She voted for Kamala Harris last year.\n\nShe said while she knew presidents were often blamed for economic forces over which they had little control, she felt in this case Trump and his policies, like tariffs, were \"shooting ourselves in the foot\".\n\nOn Tuesday night, Trump called tariffs his \"favourite word\", pointing to hundreds of billions of dollars of US revenue from the import taxes.\n\nMany Trump supporters have said they still support the president, despite feeling the pinch themselves.\n\nJohn Mohring, 60, a widower and construction worker from Kenosha, Wisconsin, has backed Trump since 2016.\n\nHe said grocery prices started rising before Trump returned to the White House \"and it doesn't seem like it's going down\".\n\nHe now typically spends $100 on groceries just for himself, even when avoiding buying meat and sticking with cheaper items.\n\nStill, Mr Mohring said he backed the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs on imported goods and his border policies.\n\n\"I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt,\" Mr Mohring added.\n\nBrad Smith, a corn and soybean farmer in north-western Illinois, was hurt earlier this year when China, previously a major buyer of US soybeans, froze its purchases amid a trade war with Washington.\n\nBut the market, he said, had been gradually recovering since late October, when the two countries reached a deal and China resumed some purchases.\n\nTrump on Monday also announced a $12bn aid package for US farmers.\n\nMr Smith said he still believed in Trump's plans for the economy, despite being getting caught in the crossfire.\n\n\"There's probably bigger things at play other than just the soybean and corn market,\" Mr Smith said.\n\n\"The whole America First idea is good.\"","summary":"President Donald Trump has told a campaign-style rally that consumer prices are falling \"tremendously\", as he seeks to allay voter anxiety about the cost of living in the US.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/trump-vows-to-make-us-affordable-again-as-americans-feel-the-pinch/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1002.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 14:46:08","author":"Bbc 46pm,Emmanuel Tetteh","authors":["Bbc 46pm","Emmanuel Tetteh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.39},{"id":386875222,"title":"Too Good to Check: Did the NRSC Deke Dems Into Clearing the Field For Crockett?","text":"Let me start with a disclaimer: I do not for one second believe this rumor to be true. It's not that the strategy would be bad; it's that it's too good for the GOP to pull off. Think Todd Akin, only in California or Massachusetts. \n\nUnless Claire McCaskill has switched sides and now does strategy for the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), color me skeptical about this report from NOTUS. Deeply skeptical:\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee put out a poll in July with Crockett’s name included, which showed her as the leading Democrat in a hypothetical matchup.“When we saw the results, we were like, ‘OK, we got to disseminate this far and wide,’” a source familiar with the process told NOTUS. The fact that Crockett was included in the poll was no accident.In June news broke that Texas Democrats Colin Allred, James Talarico, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke and Rep. Joaquin Castro met to discuss the 2026 election. Operatives at the NRSC realized that Crockett — whose political stock had been rising — wasn’t included in that meeting and also hadn’t been included in any credible poll. So they decided to change that.Following the NRSC’s polls, other surveys began to include Crockett and showed similar results: She was surging in the primary.\n\nAccording to their sources at the NRSC, the manipulation didn't end there. The NRSC then started \"seeding\" the poll results into \"progressive spaces,\" which not only raised Rep. Jasmine Crockett's profile but also apparently convinced Crockett herself that she could win the election. That snowballed into this week, when a candidate that might have competed well enough to make Republicans nervous after their own bruising primary – Colin Allred – decided to withdraw in Crockett's favor.\n\nOr so these NRSC sources claim. \n\nIs this true? Is it even possible? Well, McCaskill certainly proved it possible in 2012, but this situation is a little different. Akin was less of a national figure at the time than Crockett is now, which means that Crockett's radical nature is already well known. (Akin's issue was more a lack of preparation for the big step up to the scrutiny a Senate race produces.) Crockett had already become a popular leading figure among progressive activists. Perhaps the NRSC kicked a stone or two to start an avalanche, but some of the rocks had been shifting for the last couple of years. \n\nAlso, the panic suggested by NOTUS and other media outlets over the upcoming GOP primary fight may be overblown. Without a doubt, John Cornyn faces the fight of his life against Ken Paxton, a MAGA favorite. RCP has aggregated three polls in this race, and all three show a dead heat between the two, with former House Republican Wesley Hunt suddenly getting a significant amount of support, too. However, the primary will take place in March, which leaves the Texas GOP plenty of time to heal up any divisions that will open up over the next three months before the voting starts in the general election. \n\nDonald Trump beat Kamala Harris by 14 points last November. Ted Cruz beat Allred by nine points in 2022. The Senate race will not be a special election; Texans will be prepared to turn out and will still be decisively Republican, not suddenly blue. This isn't a case where a purple state could produce surprises, and the Lone Star State certainly isn't the Big Apple, even if Crockett seems confused by the difference:\n\nRep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, pointed to Mamdani-Trump voters, AOC-Trump voters and Obama-Trump voters when confronted Tuesday on her difficult path to victory in the Texas Senate race.MS NOW host Chris Hayes asked Crockett about people who question her ability to win the \"8 to 10% of Republican voters necessary to win this race,\" who cited the voters who supported both President Donald Trump and Democrats like Zohran Mamdani, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and former President Barack Obama.Crocket, who launched her Texas Senate bid on Monday, disagreed with the notion that she needs to win over a percentage of Republican voters and said she hoped to energize her base in a way Democratic candidates have failed to do in the past.\"I don’t think anyone who is super in love with Trump would ever vote for me or any other Democrat. That is just the reality. I think what it is, is who is going to talk to people and make them understand that they will fight for them. That is why you have Mamdani-Trump voters. That is why you have AOC-Trump voters. That is why you had Obama-Trump voters,\" she told Hayes.\n\nEr ... AOC-Trump voters? Ocasio-Cortez won her NY-14 seat last year by 69.2/30.8. Kamala Harris won that district by a 65/33 split. If there were any AOC-Trump votes, you could probably cast those on your fingers and toes. The slight difference in percentage may be largely accounted for by voters who declined to mark their ballots in one election or the other. Even if one assumes that the difference is entirely attributable to voters who chose both AOC and Trump, though, that would be voters in a very, very radical-Left district. The notable point about those votes wouldn't be MAGAs who voted for AOC, but Democrats who couldn't stomach Harris. \n\nAnyway, I hope I'm wrong about the NRSC, and that they have truly learned to play McCaskill's game at Machiavellian levels. I'm more inclined to think they got lucky that Democrats decided to get stupid. Frankly, I'll take either explanation. \n\nEditor’s Note: Every single day, here at Hot Air, we will stand up and FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT against the radical left and deliver the conservative reporting our readers deserve.

Former county commissioner Eileen Higgins won Tuesday’s runoff election, a closely watched race that drew attention from national political figures, including President Donald Trump.\n\nUnofficial results from Miami-Dade County show Higgins winning 59% of the vote, according to The Washington Post. She defeated Emilio González, a former Miami city manager, who received nearly 41%.\n\nIn a victory statement, Higgins said: “Tonight, the people of Miami made history. Together, we turned the page on years of chaos and corruption and opened the door to a new era for our city — one defined by ethical, accountable leadership that delivers real results for the people.” \n\nFederal backing\n\nThough Miami’s mayoral election is technically nonpartisan, it drew attention from big-name politicians.\n\nFormer Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg offered support for Higgins. While Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis backed González, with the president saying he’s “fantastic” and calling the election an “important race.”\n\nSignificance of the race\n\nWith Higgins’ victory, she becomes not only the first Democratic mayor in nearly three decades, but she’s also the first woman mayor in the history of Miami and the first non-Hispanic mayor since the 1990s. \n\nHer victory represents a shift in South Florida politics. Democrats have seen a string of competitive showings this year, including close contests in traditionally Republican districts. Still, strategists from both parties cautioned against reading the Miami results as a sign that nearby congressional seats are likely to flip in 2026.\n\nPolitics in Miami\n\nMiami’s recent political trajectory has leaned increasingly Republican. In 2024, Kamala Harris narrowly defeated Trump in Miami, a steep drop from Joe Biden’s 19-point margin in 2020.\n\nRepublicans DeSantis and Sen. Marco Rubio won decisively in Miami-Dade in 2022, breaking a longtime Democratic stronghold.\n\nIn 2024, Trump became the first Republican presidential candidate in 36 years to win Miami-Dade County. The president is now planning to build his presidential library in Miami. \n\nHiggins’ victory interrupts that trend — at least at the local level — returning the mayor’s office to Democratic control for the first time since the mid-1990s.\n\nThe post Miami elects its first Democratic mayor in nearly 30 years appeared first on Straight Arrow News.","url":"https://muvitv.com/2025/12/10/miami-elects-its-first-democratic-mayor-in-nearly-30-years/","image":"https://muvitv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25344035489895_Lynne_Sladky__The_Associated_Press_clean-daUl2i.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 14:14:40","author":"Muvi","authors":["Muvi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.088},{"id":386861028,"title":"Mark Kelly Says He’s “Been Through Harder Things” Than Pete Hegseth’s Attacks","text":"Raised in northern New Jersey, Kelly has for 17 years lived in Arizona, the state he now represents as a Democratic US senator. In between, Kelly was an astronaut who made four trips into space and a Navy pilot who flew 39 combat missions over Iraq. That military background has now put Kelly into Trump’s crosshairs. Last month, as the president gleefully cheered on the bombing of boats allegedly running drugs from Venezuela, Kelly appeared in a video to remind US troops they have a duty to refuse illegal orders.\nTrump was furious. He called for the Democrats to be jailed and railed that the video was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”\nThe idea for the message had originated with Michigan senator Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA analyst, and the video included four other members of Congress who served in the military or in US intelligence agencies. But Kelly has become the prime target for retribution because he retired as a Navy captain—and could be recalled to active duty and punished. Hegseth announced he was launching a probe into Kelly to determine whether Kelly had violated military law, with the results due December 10—even though in 2016, Hegseth publicly made essentially the same point about refusing illegal orders.\nThe 61-year-old Kelly is unfazed, even though he has been besieged by graphic death threats ever since Trump’s attack and has hired private security guards for his own protection. “He is not intimidating me, and he’s not going to,” Kelly says. “I have been through, you know, harder things than this.” Chief among them is the assassination attempt that led to Kelly running for office in the first place: In 2011 his wife, Arizona Democratic congresswoman Gabby Giffords, was shot in the back of the head during a constituent meeting, violence that erupted amid escalating political rhetoric.\n“I sat next to my wife’s hospital bed for months, without any idea of how it was gonna turn out,” Kelly says. “Most people don’t survive that kind of wound.” Giffords barely did. In 2020, he ran in, and won, a special election squeaker to fill the remainder of the late John McCain’s Senate term. Kelly was elected again, to a full term, in 2022.\nThe primary audience for the video, Kelly insists, is the enlisted men and women who are on the front lines of Trump’s belligerent agenda, and who could be vulnerable to prosecution for war crimes. “They’re going to be under tremendous pressure to do something they will later regret, that they might find was not lawful,” Kelly says. And while the action is in the Caribbean Sea right now, the senator is concerned it could shift into American cities. “[Trump] talks about sending the military to train on US citizens, and people think, ‘Oh, well, he’s not going to do it. It’s just Trump being Trump.’ That’s how we got here,” Kelly says. “We know who Donald Trump is, right? We knew who he was even when he was running for office the first time. This is a guy who talked about killing—killing—women and children. He said we should have the military kill the family members of terrorists. You know, you can't put that shit back in the donkey.”\nWhich is one reason the video statement by Kelly and his colleagues has resonance beyond any literal battlefields. For decades, conventional wisdom ceded national security, as a political issue, to the Republicans. But that’s been slowly changing. Recent, prominent examples include wins last month for Democrats Mikie Sherrill (a former Navy officer) and Abigail Spanberger (a former CIA officer) in gubernatorial races (in New Jersey and Virginia). Democrats are recruiting more veterans to run elsewhere as part of an appeal beyond the coastal elites. “Voters trust veterans,” says Matt Corridoni, a Democratic strategist who has worked with vet candidates. “They're not afraid to go out there and reclaim patriotism and reclaim the flag, and they do it with a level of authenticity and credibility that your standard politician doesn't have.”\nLast year, Kelly was one of three finalists—along with Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro and Minnesota governor Tim Walz—in Kamala Harris’s search for a running mate. “That would have been fun,” Kelly says now. “I think the election would probably have had the same outcome, unfortunately.” Currently, Kelly barely shows up in polling about the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination—but it’s still early. “I like that Kelly is out there and he’s not just taking it from the president,” says Rebecca Pearcey, who was a top strategist for Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 primary bid. “He’s fighting back when Democrats have lost some energy because it’s so exhausting.”\n“He’s got a weighty and appealing resume, and the field is going to be wide open,” another veteran Democratic presidential campaign strategist stays. “Why wouldn’t he take a shot?”\nWhen I tell Kelly that a friend suspects he’s already running—because she receives more fundraising emails from him than anyone else—the senator laughs. “I’m not the lead fundraiser. I hire people to figure that stuff out for me,” he says. “I’ve got a lot on my plate right now. Apparently tomorrow the Navy is supposed to say something about my court martial.” He lets out another, tighter laugh. “Trump is not gonna scare me,” Kelly says. “He's a wannabe authoritarian, and we've gotta make sure he doesn't get there.”","summary":"In an interview, the Arizona senator says the defense secretary “is not intimidating me, and he’s not going to”—though he’s less forthcoming about a potential 2028 presidential run.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/mark-kelly-pete-hegseth-investigation-interview","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/693976b9a348c67d922bd563/16:9/w_3360,h_1890,c_limit/2167175727","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 13:36:17","author":"Chris Smith","authors":["Chris Smith"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":386844632,"title":"Harris says she remains confident in her legacy as &#8216;historical figure&#8217;","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for president in 2024, said she has reached a point in her public life where she no longer feels pressured to secure her place in history.
