The Republican accused ABC of bias on Sunday, posting: \"I ask, why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network?\" His campaign maintains that the debate should occur under the conditions agreed with Biden before he dropped out, although the ex-president himself has said the mic issue \"doesn't matter to me. I'd rather have it probably on\". Harris's team says the Trump camp wants the mics muted to help the Republican maintain discipline when not speaking, because \"they don't think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes\".

This element of democratic adventurism has been an important aspect of the competitive methodology of electoral choice in the American polity ever since Barack Obama became the first black President of the USA in 2008. In an ironic twist it was the same factor of adventurous choice that led to the election of an irredeemable autocrat named Donald Trump as Obama’s successor. In spite of the fact that Trump used terminology that was profoundly anti-democratic as the core sentiment of his political vision in his campaign for office in 2016 the political system accommodated his worst attitudes to a surprising extent. As a consequence, although he conducted a deeply misogynistic campaign against Hilary Clinton, and actually failed to gain a popular majority he was able to claim victorious ascendancy through the deployment of electoral votes. In his response to Kamala Harris’s challenge to his effort to return to office Trump’s blustery abuse has made it plain that he expects to use the same tactic against her. It is clear that Donald Trump’s approach to political contest is based on personal conceit and opportunism, two elements of human behaviour which he is adept at deploying. Before he entered the political arena in 2015 this aspect of his personality had been successfully utilised in his career as a reality show host on television, and he transferred this success to the political arena by assuming that the electorate would succumb to his blustery blandishments. He was proven right in 2016 but after four years in power the insubstantiality of his presumptions had begun to be recognised by the average voter and he lost the attempt to hold on to power. However, his response to public rejection has been so vehement that he has provoked the worst instincts of public disenchantment in the American electorate. His response to Kamala Harris’s emergence has shown that he intends to use this emotion to provoke the adventurous spirit of American political sentiment to support and justify his most selfish attitudes. In confronting this reality Kamala Harris has adopted exactly the opposite formula of contestation by articulating a vision of governance based on common sense rather than bluster. Donald Trump on the other hand has chosen to accelerate his annoyance in response to Harris’s calm sense of sanity and good order in the hope that some irrational elements of the electorate will be inspired by his habitual bluster. The gravest danger that this situation poses is to the survival of a sane and stable order of democratic governance in America. While the sense of adventurous competitive choice might have encouraged diversity and change, as in the case of the election of Obama, it was the same spirit of adventure that led to the experimental selection of Donald Trump in 2016. The major challenge that has evolved from this conjunction of boisterous rhetoric and systematic decision-making is for common sense to become the motivation that ignites public sentiment as opposed to conceited bluster. It is however very dangerous to assume that the outcome of this interaction will always result in the best and most representative result for the electoral community. The eventual result of such adventurous contestation can lead to some of the most distressing results if the process is allowed to be manipulated by formal allies of the more opportunistic participant, and Donald Trump is clearly hoping to be able to take advantage of any such opportunity. In that case Kamala Harris’s team of supporters and the Democratic Party’s officials must be extraordinarily vigilant over the conduct of the forthcoming polls. They must campaign energetically in the so-called battleground states in the weeks before the elections with the effective objective in mind of mounting serious defence of controversial results after the elections, especially if Harris is declared victorious. In the days, weeks and months following the polls Donald Trump’s penchant for blustery rhetoric and manipulative conspiracy theories will be unveiled most vehemently if Kamala is declared the winner. If she loses the contest he will probably mount a boisterous verbal assault on her credibility in order to regale his supporters with proof of his superiority and to justify his dysfunctional victory. In such an event the ascendancy of his blustery character will be revealed in all its splendor and Kamala Harris’s attempt to consolidate the common sense view of earlier government decisions will be rubbished totally by the machinery of state led by Donald Trump. The unique element of this electoral competition is not only defined by the unusual origin of the Democratic Party’s candidate but also by the dangerous consequences that are threatened if she loses. For this reason, some knowledgeable observers have described the forthcoming contest as the most vital and controversial Presidential contest to take place in the USA for more than a century. In fact, this is one contest in which the adventurous perception of the electorate should be deployed in defence of the popular will rather than in defence of privilege. Kamala Harris has demonstrated the eloquence of common sense in only a few days while Donald Trump has for a long time exhibited the undeniable resilience of self-willed bluster. The American electorate now has a unique opportunity to demonstrate the relevance and true value of its adventurous decision making to preserving genuine democracy at the polls. · Barrett is a Jamaican-born Poet, Novelist and Journalist","summary":"&#160;The forthcoming election is&#160;one in which the adventurous perception of the electorate should be deployed in defence of the popular will rather than in defence of privilege, argues&#160;LINDSAY BARRETT The","url":"https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2024/08/28/commonsense-vs-bluster-americas-unique-political-adventure/","image":"https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Kamala-Harris.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 00:35:35","author":"Adeyinka Salami","authors":["Adeyinka Salami"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":255065424,"title":"Harris will sit down with CNN for her first interview since launching presidential bid","text":"News & Politics Harris will sit down with CNN for her first interview since launching presidential bid Vice President Kamala Harris is sitting down with CNN this week for her first interview since President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid. By ADRIANA GOMEZ LICON The Associated Press August 28, 2024 at 12:29AM Vice President Kamala Harris is sitting down with CNN this week for her first interview since President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid. The Democratic presidential nominee will be joined by her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in an interview with CNN anchor Dana Bash in Savannah, Georgia. The interview will air Friday at 9 p.m. Eastern time. Harris' lack of access has become one of Republicans' key lines of attacks against her as she ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket after Biden's July 21 announcement. The CNN interview may be an opportunity for Harris to quell criticism that she is unprepared for uncontrolled environments, but it may also carry risks as her team tries to build on momentum from the ticket shakeup and Democratic National Convention. During her three-plus years as vice president, she has done on-camera and print interviews with The Associated Press and many other outlets, often at a pace more frequent than Biden. The Trump campaign has kept a tally of the days she has gone by as a candidate without giving an interview. On Tuesday, the campaign reacted to the news by noting the interview was joint, saying ''she's not competent enough to do it on her own.'' Earlier this month, Harris had told reporters that she wanted to do her first formal interview before the end of August. Harris travels with members of the media on Air Force Two for all trips and nearly always comes to the back of the plane to speak to them for a few minutes before takeoff. Her office insists that those conversations are off the record, though, so what she says can't be used publicly. She will rally voters in Savannah on Thursday as part of a bus tour that kicks off on Wednesday.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris is sitting down with CNN this week for her first interview since President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid.","url":"https://www.startribune.com/harris-will-sit-down-with-cnn-for-her-first-interview-since-launching-presidential-bid/601132581","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 00:33:01","author":"Adriana Gomez Licon","authors":["Adriana Gomez Licon"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.065},{"id":255065376,"title":"Harris will sit down with CNN for her first interview since launching presidential bid","text":"By ADRIANA GOMEZ LICON Vice President Kamala Harris is sitting down with CNN this week for her first interview since President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid.

The debate between Vice President Harris and former President Trump is scheduled for September 10, in what will be their first-ever bout in the run-up to the Presidential election. But on Sunday, Trump took to social media and labeled ABC ‘FAKE NEWS’ asking, ‘Why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network?’ Also while campaigning in Northern Virginia on Monday, Trump was asked again whether he should to the debate. He replied: ‘I think ABC really should be shut out. I’d much rather do it on NBC. ‘I’d much rather do it on CBS. Frankly, I think CBS is very unfair, but the best of the group. And certainly, I’d do it on Fox.’ In response, Kamala Harris’ campaign team released a video of Donald Trump speaking to Fox News, in which he rails against ABC and says doesn’t need to debate his rival as he has a lead in the polls, with chicken sounds added. The Kamala HQ team posted the video on X, asking: ‘You scared, Donald Trump?’ Trump tore into the network after 10pm on Sunday night in a post on Truth Social, where he gave bad reviews to the network’s weekend programming before raising the threat. ‘I watched ABC FAKE NEWS this morning, both lightweight reporter Jonathan Carl’s (K?) ridiculous and biased interview of Tom Cotton (who was fantastic!), and their so-called Panel of Trump Haters, and I ask, why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network?’ he wrote. He was referencing the network’s Jonathan Karl, who questioned Trump at the White House during his presidency. Then he went on to go after members of the network’s ‘This Week’ panel, including Donna Brazil, a member of the DNC who parted ways with CNN after hacked emails posted on WikiLeaks in 2016 revealed her shipping debate questions to the Hillary Clinton camp. ‘Will panelist Donna Brazil give the questions to the Marxist Candidate like she did for Crooked Hillary Clinton? Will Kamala’s best friend, who heads up ABC, do likewise. Where is Liddle’ George Slopadopolus hanging out now? Will he be involved. They’ve got a lot of questions to answer!!! Why did Harris turn down Fox, NBC, CBS, and even CNN? Stay tuned!!!’ Trump wrote. Stephanopoulos apologized in July after he was caught on video speaking to a passerby about President Joe Biden. ‘I don’t think he can serve four more years,’ the host said, days before Biden decided to get out of the race. Trump was at it again during an appearance at a shopping center filled with Vietnamese shops and restaurants in Falls Church, Virginia. ‘I think it’s disgraceful, and I think ABC is a disgrace,’ Trump said. ‘I think having Donna Brazile sitting on that panel, she’s the one that gave the answers and the questions to Hillary Clinton before a debate. I think ABC is really, should be shut out. I’d much rather do it on NBC. I’d much rather do it on CBS, frankly, I think CBS is very unfair, but the best of the group, and certainly I’d do it on Fox. I’d even do it on CNN,’ Trump said. He again complained about the ABC roundtable, saying the ‘hostility is crazy.’ Trump called Harris a ‘dummy.’ The two camps continue to haggle over the terms of the upcoming debate, the only one left that both sides have agreed to. Harris advisor Brian Fallon said both candidates should have their mics kept live throughout the broadcast. ‘Our understanding is that Trump’s handlers prefer the muted microphone because they don’t think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own,’ he said in a statement. The Trump camp, meanwhile, says Harris wants a seated debate that allows for notes and opening statements. The Harris camp disputes this. ‘All three parties (Trump, Harris and ABC) have agreed to standing and no notes, and we never sought otherwise,’ said Fallon. Trump said he would ‘probably’ rather have the mics remain hot, but said ‘I think it should be the same,’ meaning the pre-negotiated rules without a hot mic should remain in place. Whatever Trump’s criticisms of the network, he may feel pressure to show up. Trump’s June 27 contest with Biden began the cascading events that forced the 81-year-old president to end his campaign. And next month he will confront a Harris campaign that is on the move after her political convention and a fresh fundraising haul. Harris has also turned around the race in ‘Blue Wall’ battleground states while evening the race in others. Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have moved to ‘lean Democratic’, according to the latest NPR analysis out Monday, while while Nevada, Arizona, and North Carolina have moved to ‘tossup’ status. Karl clashed with Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton on Sunday’s ‘This Week,’ after he blasted Kamala Harris for her past support of Mecicare-for-all. Cotton compared it to ‘taking away health insurance on the job for 170 million Americans.’ ‘What do you mean taking away health insurance? What are you talking about?’ Karl shot back. ‘I mean, that is not her position now,’ Karl continued. Harris has since walked back her position from the 2020 primary, and is now in line with the Biden administration on health policy. ‘How do you know that is not her position now?’ countered Cotton. Trump has threatened to bail out on debates in the past, including earlier this month, when he threatened to hold back from the ABC debate, preferring an earlier one on Fox that Harris has not agreed to.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris has taunted Donald Trump with chicken noises after he suggested&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris&#8217; team taunts Donald Trump with &#8216;chicken sounds&#8217; following his threat to withdraw from &#8216;unfair&#8217; ABC debate in the coming month. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/world-news/kamala-harris-team-taunts-donald-trump-with-chicken-sounds-following-his-threat-to-withdraw-from-unfair-abc-debate-in-the-coming-month/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/27/13/88974277-0-image-m-277_1724760798691.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 00:29:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.145},{"id":255065282,"title":"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sawed the head off a whale and drove it home, daughter says","text":"It is a violation of long-standing federal law to collect parts from the carcass of a protected marine animal if there are still “soft tissues” attached. It becomes political intrigue if the collector was Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and the severed head of a possibly protected marine mammal streamed “whale juice” down the side of the family minivan three decades ago. On Monday, the political arm of the Center for Biological Diversity, a progressive environmental organization, called on federal authorities to investigate an episode, recounted by Kennedy’s daughter in a 2012 magazine article, in which she said Kennedy chain-sawed the head off a dead whale on a beach in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, bungee-corded it to their vehicle’s roof, and drove it five hours to the family home in Mount Kisco, New York. “It was the rankest thing on the planet,” Kick Kennedy, then 24, told Town & Country in the article, which described Robert Kennedy as someone who likes to study animal skulls and skeletons. The story recently resurfaced, including in an entertainment publication, The Wrap, on Sunday and in a New York Post article Monday. In a letter to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees marine protection, Brett Hartl, the national political director for the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund, wrote: “There are good reasons why it is illegal for any person to collect or keep parts of any endangered species.” “Most importantly, vital research opportunities are lost when individuals scavenge a wildlife carcass and interfere with the work of scientists. This is particularly true of marine mammals, which are some of the most difficult wildlife species in the world to study.” Some species of whales, Hartl noted, are so rare that scientists can learn about them only through their carcasses washed ashore. Kennedy, he wrote, may have violated not only the Marine Mammal Protection Act (1972) and the Endangered Species Act (1973) — two seminal marine conservation laws — but also the Lacey Act of 1900, a conservation law signed by President William McKinley that prohibits the transportation of illegally gathered wildlife, dead or alive, across state lines. Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment. Representatives for NOAA did not respond to a request for comment. The whale has now joined a baby bear, at least one emu and a worm whose deaths have been intimately associated with Kennedy, the independent presidential candidate — and environmental lawyer — who last week joined forces with former President Donald Trump’s campaign. The Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president. Kennedy, 70, is a lifelong collector, trainer and handler of wild animals. At his home in Los Angeles, where he has been taming a pair of wild ravens, he also keeps a taxidermied turtle (a former pet) and a rare Sumatran tiger (a gift to his father). Other former pets include at least two emus, one of whom was killed by a mountain lion, the other by a family dog. This month, Kennedy acknowledged that he had left a dead bear cub in Central Park in 2014 because he thought it would be “amusing” — an admission that came ahead of a piece in The New Yorker that detailed the episode. Kennedy told Roseanne Barr that he found the dead bear and had planned to skin the bear and put the meat in his refrigerator, but instead staged it with a bicycle in Central Park. While some of his pursuits with wildlife have been merely curious, some may have skirted the line of the law. The North American Migratory Bird Treaty Act, for example, prohibits the “capture” of at least two species of ravens. New York law prohibits the “illegal possession” and the “illegal disposal” of a bear. In an interview Tuesday, Hartl said the whale incident, if true, would represent a “far worse” violation than the bear cub. (And if Kennedy still has any part of the whale’s skeleton, he could still potentially be charged with a federal offense even 30 years later, Hartl said.) “When you swear into the bar” as a lawyer, “you take an oath to uphold the law,” said Hartl, noting that he, like Kennedy, is an environmental lawyer. “This isn’t a stupid rule. This is the law — laws that were passed almost unanimously” decades ago, he said. “This is not some silly current thing of the ‘corrupt deep state’ that he now claims to care about.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"Three decades later, an environmental organization is calling for an investigation.\n\n\nThe post Robert F.

I’ll never take anyone or anything for granted, and I know my own self-worth now. You could maybe have walked over me in the past, but now I know my strength.' The dancer had found a lump in her breast the day before heading on honeymoon in May last year and after undergoing treatment, she was given the all clear this year.

She said: 'When you suffer from a chronic illness or cancer, there’s a weird sense that the world is spinning without you. Your normality is taken away and you lose a sense of purpose. I’m usually such a busy bee, but I was waking up every day and not doing what I love, so the book gave me purpose in what was a very lonely dark time.' It comes as Amy fans were left 'sobbing' and branded her an 'inspiration' on Monday night as she bravely opened up about her breast cancer journey in her heartbreaking BBC documentary, Cancer and Me. in a new interview, Amy told how she's taking a positive outlook on life after coming through the other side, admitting she's no longer 'angry' at the disease 'Cancer has changed me forever. I’ll never take anyone or anything for granted, and I know my own self-worth now. You could maybe have walked over me in the past, but now I know my strength' While she's over the worst, the Welsh beauty candidly admitted that there were times that she didn't think she'd make it through the illness as negative thoughts engulfed her Amy positively told how she's moved on from those thoughts now and that her cancer experience had even helped her to not stress about her Crohn’s as it had to 'take a backseat' over cancer Amy decided to let the cameras in to document her journey, with the film following Amy through several stages of her fight with the disease. Read the full interview in Prima’s October issue, on sale Wednesday 28th August The film saw several heart-wrenching moments, including Amy facing her first chemotherapy session, the agonising wait for results and the TV star shaving her head as she tackled her hair loss. Watching the scenes unfold, several viewers rushed to X, formerly known as Twitter, to share their admiration for the Welsh dancer, with several noting they were in tears as they watched her health struggle. They penned: 'Tough watch, but what an inspiration.' 'Oh my dear Lord, #AmyDowden is such an inspiration, Bless her heart. Am sobbing Xx.' 'Sat here watching Strictly Amy : cancer and me, and I'm crying. Love you, Amy.' I’ve come through the other side, and I can’t be angry any more. I can’t change what’s happened, I can only move on. I have the rest of my life ahead of me and I can’t give it any more time than it has already taken.'

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world and affects more than two MILLION women a year Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. Each year in the UK there are more than 55,000 new cases, and the disease claims the lives of 11,500 women. In the US, it strikes 266,000 each year and kills 40,000. But what causes it and how can it be treated? What is breast cancer? It comes from a cancerous cell which develops in the lining of a duct or lobule in one of the breasts. When the breast cancer has spread into surrounding tissue it is called 'invasive'. Some people are diagnosed with 'carcinoma in situ', where no cancer cells have grown beyond the duct or lobule. Most cases develop in those over the age of 50 but younger women are sometimes affected. Breast cancer can develop in men, though this is rare. Staging indicates how big the cancer is and whether it has spread. Stage 1 is the earliest stage and stage 4 means the cancer has spread to another part of the body. The cancerous cells are graded from low, which means a slow growth, to high, which is fast-growing. High-grade cancers are more likely to come back after they have first been treated. What causes breast cancer? A cancerous tumour starts from one abnormal cell. The exact reason why a cell becomes cancerous is unclear. It is thought that something damages or alters certain genes in the cell. This makes the cell abnormal and multiply 'out of control'. Although breast cancer can develop for no apparent reason, there are some risk factors that can increase the chance, such as genetics. What are the symptoms of breast cancer? The usual first symptom is a painless lump in the breast, although most are not cancerous and are fluid filled cysts, which are benign. The first place that breast cancer usually spreads to is the lymph nodes in the armpit. If this occurs you will develop a swelling or lump in an armpit. How is breast cancer diagnosed? Initial assessment: A doctor examines the breasts and armpits. They may do tests such as a mammography, a special x-ray of the breast tissue which can indicate the possibility of tumours. Biopsy: A biopsy is when a small sample of tissue is removed from a part of the body. The sample is then examined under a microscope to look for abnormal cells. The sample can confirm or rule out cancer. If you are confirmed to have breast cancer, further tests may be needed to assess if it has spread. For example, blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the liver or a chest X-ray. How is breast cancer treated? Treatment options which may be considered include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone treatment. Often a combination of two or more of these treatments are used. Surgery: Breast-conserving surgery or the removal of the affected breast depending on the size of the tumour. Radiotherapy: A treatment which uses high energy beams of radiation focused on cancerous tissue. This kills cancer cells, or stops them from multiplying. It is mainly used in addition to surgery. Chemotherapy: A treatment of cancer by using anti-cancer drugs which kill cancer cells, or stop them from multiplying. Hormone treatments: Some types of breast cancer are affected by the 'female' hormone oestrogen, which can stimulate the cancer cells to divide and multiply. Treatments which reduce the level of these hormones, or prevent them from working, are commonly used in people with breast cancer. How successful is treatment? The outlook is best in those who are diagnosed when the cancer is still small, and has not spread. Surgical removal of a tumour in an early stage may then give a good chance of cure. The routine mammography offered to women between the ages of 50 and 71 means more breast cancers are being diagnosed and treated at an early stage.

The candidate running for president as a Republican announced to his followers that he will be introducing a new set of trading cards. Customers who buy ,500 worth of these cards will also get a fragment of his suit as a bonus. “Back by popular demand, my TRUMP DIGITAL TRADING CARDS, Series 4: The America First Collection, is available RIGHT NOW, and I think you’ll love it!” he announced on Truth Social alongside a video of him talking in front of American flags. The collection includes 50 new digital trading cards that feature pictures of Trump dancing and posing in superhero costumes. He’s also pictured holding Bitcoins in some of the cards. There are multiple tiers of perks for those who purchase one of his digital trading cards. For those who buy 15 digital cards, a physical card will be sent in the mail along with a piece of Trump’s suit that he wore to debate President Joe Biden. “People are calling it the knock-out suit,” Trump said in the video. “I don’t know about that but that’s what they’re calling it.” He added that the suit marked a “piece of presidential history.” Each digital trading card is priced at $99, so supporters will have to purchase a total of $1,485 worth of digital cards to receive the physical card and piece of Trump’s suit. “This is something to give your family, kids, your grandchildren,” he added. Trump explained that those who purchase the $1,485 worth of digital cards will receive a small piece of the fabric he wore when he debated Biden. Five of those pieces will also be autographed by the former president. The second tier of prizes is for those who purchase 75 digital trading cards, a price point of $7,425. They will receive a piece of Trump’s suit, a physical card, and an invitation to join the former president for a gala at his private club in Jupiter, Florida. “We really have tremendous dinners with my collectors, we have a lot of fun together, we’ll have a great time,” he continued in the video. Supporters must put in their e-mail addresses to purchase the cards and can pay with cryptocurrency or their credit cards. “They call me the crypto president – I don’t know if that’s true or not but a lot of people are saying that, so don’t miss out,” Trump said. “We’re going to have a lot of fun, we’ll be talking about this for a long time,” Trump continued. Trump’s digital trading cards are a staple in his campaign. He previously sold The MugShot Edition cards in December after he was indicted on election interference charges in August 2023. Trump also included pieces of the suit he wore when he was arrested to those who bought 47 cards. His first round of digital trading cards was launched in 2022 and they sold out in less than a day. MORE ON THE SUIT Trump is cutting up the suit he wore to debate Biden as a prize for his digital card collectors. Trump and Biden debated one another on June 27, hosted by CNN moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. Biden entered the debate with increasing fears of his age and mental fitness as Trump needed to prove his appeal to moderates. Biden failed to ease concerns he could beat Trump in November, and calls quickly came from Democrats for him to step aside. He stood firm in his intent to run and chalked up his debate performance to a “bad night.” Biden explained that he was exhausted from previously traveling for the anniversary of D-Day in France and the G7 meeting in Italy. “I don’t speak as smoothly as I used to. I don’t debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth,” he reiterated at a rally soon after in North Carolina. However, after multiple appearances in the press and a continued push on the campaign, Biden ended his bid for re-election on July 21 in a letter to the nation. Vice President Kamala Harris quickly stepped in as the Democratic nominee and formally accepted the nomination at the Democratic National Convention on August 22. ROUND 2? Even though Trump and Biden’s debate marked the beginning of the end of Biden’s re-election bid, Trump also made some blunders himself. Politifact tracked 15 false statements Trump made, while the New York Times cited 20 and another 21 that were misleading or lacked context. The Associated Press corrected 11 false statements from Trump and four from Biden. In comparison, Politifact pointed out three false statements from Biden, and the New York Times found zero. While Biden has dropped out of the race, Trump will have another chance to prove his debating skills against a new challenger. The debate has sparked back and forth between Harris and Trump since Harris launched her presidential campaign. After weeks of controversy, the two agreed to debate in the swing state of Pennsylvania moderated by ABC News on September 10.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nALTHOUGH Donald Trump may have pivoted to politics, he&#8217;s reminding supporters of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;Trump Offers &#8216;Piece of Presidential History&#8217; with Knockout Suit Worn at Debate Under $1,500&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/trump-offers-piece-of-presidential-history-with-knockout-suit-worn-at-debate-under-1500/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trump-selling-pieces-of-‘knockout-suit-he-wore-at-debate.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 00:08:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.133},{"id":255064974,"title":"Prosecutors Resubmit Charges That Trump Tried To Overturn Election","text":"Prosecutors on Tuesday filed a revised indictment of Donald Trump, pressing ahead with bombshell charges that he tried to overturn the 2020 US election after losing to Joe Biden.The superseding indictment retains the same four charges against Trump as in an earlier version but takes into account a recent Supreme Court ruling that a former president has broad immunity from criminal prosecution.The new indictment of the 78-year-old Republican White House candidate is 36 pages long, down from 45 pages previously, and removes material affected by the immunity ruling from the conservative-dominated top court.It retains the same core, stating that Trump lost in 2020 but \"was determined to remain in power\" and attempted to subvert the results.The Supreme Court ruled in July that an ex-president has broad immunity from prosecution for official acts conducted while in office, but can be pursued for unofficial acts.This threw into doubt the historic prosecution of the ex-president.Trump referred to the new indictment as an \"act of desperation\" that was part of a \"witch hunt\" against him.\"The illegally appointed 'Special Counsel' Deranged Jack Smith, has brought a ridiculous new Indictment against me, which has all the problems of the old Indictment, and should be dismissed IMMEDIATELY,\" he posted on his Truth Social platform.The new indictment comes three days before Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges against Trump, and lawyers for the former president had been set to file a schedule for pre-trial proceedings.Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is presiding over the case, had also scheduled a status hearing for September 5 in Washington and it was not immediately clear if that would go ahead now, following the filing of the superseding indictment.Trump's lawyers have been seeking to delay a trial until after November's election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate.Trump is accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the January 6, 2021 joint session of Congress that was attacked by Trump supporters.Trump is also accused of seeking to disenfranchise US voters with his campaign of false claims that he won the 2020 election.He was originally scheduled to go on trial on March 4, but that was put on hold while his lawyers pushed his claim of presidential immunity all the way up to the Supreme Court.It will be up to Chutkan, an appointee of former Democratic president Barack Obama, to decide which of Trump's actions regarding the 2020 election were official acts and which were unofficial acts subject to potential prosecution.That and other pre-trial issues are expected to take months, making it unlikely the case will go to trial before the November 5 presidential vote.The new indictment drops references to Jeffrey Clark, a former senior Justice Department official who was one of six co-conspirators listed in the original indictment allegedly enlisted by Trump to press his false claims of election fraud.The Supreme Court, in its immunity ruling, said a president's communications with members of the Justice Department should be considered official acts.The remaining co-conspirators, who include Trump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, \"were acting in a private capacity,\" the indictment said, \"to assist him in his criminal efforts to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election and retain power.\"Regarding the ruling on Trump's immunity, Supreme Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson said that she was \"concerned\" about the July verdict, according to an interview released by CBS news on Tuesday.\"I was concerned about a system that appeared to provide immunity for one individual under one set of circumstances, when we have a criminal justice system that had ordinarily treated everyone the same,\" she said. Jackson was among three justices to dissent from the court's ruling. Trump was convicted in New York in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels.Sentencing has been scheduled for September 18, but Trump's lawyers have asked for his conviction to be tossed, citing the Supreme Court immunity ruling, and sentencing to be delayed.Trump also faces charges in Georgia related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election.Trump was also charged in Florida with mishandling top-secret documents after leaving the White House.The judge presiding over the documents case, Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee,

Trump Tried To Overturn Election","text":"Prosecutors on Tuesday filed a revised indictment of Donald Trump, pressing ahead with bombshell charges that he tried to overturn the 2020 US election after losing to Joe Biden.The superseding indictment retains the same four charges against Trump as in an earlier version but takes into account a recent Supreme Court ruling that a former president has broad immunity from criminal prosecution.The new indictment of the 78-year-old Republican White House candidate is 36 pages long, down from 45 pages previously, and removes material affected by the immunity ruling from the conservative-dominated top court.It retains the same core, stating that Trump lost in 2020 but \"was determined to remain in power\" and attempted to subvert the results.The Supreme Court ruled in July that an ex-president has broad immunity from prosecution for official acts conducted while in office, but can be pursued for unofficial acts.This threw into doubt the historic prosecution of the ex-president.Trump referred to the new indictment as an \"act of desperation\" that was part of a \"witch hunt\" against him.\"The illegally appointed 'Special Counsel' Deranged Jack Smith, has brought a ridiculous new Indictment against me, which has all the problems of the old Indictment, and should be dismissed IMMEDIATELY,\" he posted on his Truth Social platform.The new indictment comes three days before Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges against Trump, and lawyers for the former president had been set to file a schedule for pre-trial proceedings.Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is presiding over the case, had also scheduled a status hearing for September 5 in Washington and it was not immediately clear if that would go ahead now, following the filing of the superseding indictment.Trump's lawyers have been seeking to delay a trial until after November's election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate.Trump is accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the January 6, 2021 joint session of Congress that was attacked by Trump supporters.Trump is also accused of seeking to disenfranchise US voters with his campaign of false claims that he won the 2020 election.He was originally scheduled to go on trial on March 4, but that was put on hold while his lawyers pushed his claim of presidential immunity all the way up to the Supreme Court.It will be up to Chutkan, an appointee of former Democratic president Barack Obama, to decide which of Trump's actions regarding the 2020 election were official acts and which were unofficial acts subject to potential prosecution.That and other pre-trial issues are expected to take months, making it unlikely the case will go to trial before the November 5 presidential vote.The new indictment drops references to Jeffrey Clark, a former senior Justice Department official who was one of six co-conspirators listed in the original indictment allegedly enlisted by Trump to press his false claims of election fraud.The Supreme Court, in its immunity ruling, said a president's communications with members of the Justice Department should be considered official acts.The remaining co-conspirators, who include Trump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, \"were acting in a private capacity,\" the indictment said, \"to assist him in his criminal efforts to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election and retain power.\"Regarding the ruling on Trump's immunity, Supreme Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson said that she was \"concerned\" about the July verdict, according to an interview released by CBS news on Tuesday.\"I was concerned about a system that appeared to provide immunity for one individual under one set of circumstances, when we have a criminal justice system that had ordinarily treated everyone the same,\" she said. Jackson was among three justices to dissent from the court's ruling. Trump was convicted in New York in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels.Sentencing has been scheduled for September 18, but Trump's lawyers have asked for his conviction to be tossed, citing the Supreme Court immunity ruling, and sentencing to be delayed.Trump also faces charges in Georgia related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election.Trump was also charged in Florida with mishandling top-secret documents after leaving the White House.The judge presiding over the documents case, Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, dismissed the charges on the grounds that Smith, the special counsel, was unlawfully appointed.Smith has appealed Cannon's ruling.","summary":"Prosecutors on Tuesday filed a revised indictment of Donald Trump, pressing ahead with bombshell charges that he tried to overturn the 2020 US election after losing to Joe Biden.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/prosecutors-resubmit-charges-that-trump-tried-overturn-election-3741007","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4543957/special-counsel-jack-smiths-appointment-was-declared-illegal-florida-judge.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 00:06:10","author":"Chris Lefkow","authors":["Chris Lefkow"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.385},{"id":255065722,"title":"Fox News Host Is Dragged For Sexist Remark That Army Generals Will ‘Have Their Way’ With Kamala Harris","text":"Source: Kevin Hagen / Getty MAGA America is continuing to struggle to find ways to attack Vice President Kamala Harris without being racist, sexist or both. In the GOP, bigoted attacks on Harris had gotten so bad a closed-door meeting needed to be convened by congressional Republican leaders to warn Republican lawmakers to stop with the race-baiting and misogyny—at least until they can reelect to the White House their race-baiter-and-misogynist-in-chief, Donald Trump. But right-wing “news” commentators have not gotten the memo that these attacks on Harris are out of touch and prone to backfire on white conservative America, which is why they’re still out here pushing sexist and, frankly, childish arguments about how Harris “slept her way to the top” even though she has held elected offices for most of the time she has been in the public eye. Anyway, recently, Fox News host Jesse Watters demonstrated that some of these MAGA pundits just can’t help themselves as he manages to be appallingly sexist as hell—possibly on accident. Watters insisted that if Harris became president, the Joint Chiefs of Staff “would have their way with her” in the Situation Room. “What is her foreign policy? This is where the president has his most impact,” Watters said Monday during an episode of Fox’s The Five. “We don’t know who she is. We don’t know what she believes. She’s gonna get paralyzed in the Situation Room while the generals have their way with her.” Now, Watters will likely pretend he didn’t intentionally make a meeting between the POTUS and the Joint Chiefs of Staff sound like a bad date with Bill Cosby, or that he would have ever used that kind of suggestive language when discussing a male candidate. But even Watters’ conservative MAGA-Karen co-panelists, Dana Perino and Jeanine Pirro, gave Watters a “What in the Law & Order SVU is going on here?” look and chided him for his weird observation. “Figuratively, again. Have their way with her, control her—not in a sexual way,” Watters said in an effort to clean up his absurdly sexist faux pas. Again, the crazy thing is this was probably Watters’ best attempt at being inoffensive. His remarks were about as jarring as they were when he mocked Black Democratic co-host, Harold Ford Jr., by insisting he is “white” and then questioning his racial identity on live air just so he could make some white and fragile point about the “White Dudes for Harris” political action group. Watters’ bigotry was arguably more blatant when he was spreading around the racist white nonsense that Trump would attract more Black voters after his mugshot had gone viral, or when he let his true white nationalist colors show when he insisted Barack Obama lacks “American perspective” because his “father has roots in Africa.” Anyway, plenty of folks on social media clocked the inherently misogynistic language Watters chose to describe Harris’ hypothetical meetings with policy officials, including Kerstin Emhoff, the ex-wife of Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff. “There are many things to worry about, but Kamala being manhandled in the situation room is not one of them,” Kerstin tweeted. One thing right-wing pundits need to worry about regarding a Kamala Harris presidency is how they’re going to get through the next four years at least without continuing to make their networks look like a cross between a Klan rally and a campaign to turn America into The Handmaid’s Tale. Or maybe they can just finally learn to read the room.

They say they can’t abide by Kamala Harris’ position on the war in Gaza. If I understand their view correctly, they believe that voting for the Democratic nominee is voting for genocide. I have already explained why I think third-party candidates who are seeking the presidency are scammers. They can’t win. They know they can’t win. And they know they are lying to people when they say they can. But I want to address something else: that third parties give the impression that voting is the only tool of democratic politics. It isn’t. Small democratic politics happens continuously. It’s all around us. It is the force by which normal people are able to make the world a better place. It happens when we voice opinions about this or that issue. It happens when we give money and time to important causes. It happens when together we decide matters of right and wrong. Wherever there are Americans who are arguing over history, ideas, interests, resources and the law, there is also democratic politics. Because democratic politics is a feature of the American condition, it is larger than electoral politics, which is to say, elections and voting. Democratic politics is so normal as to be invisible, but electoral politics comes around only occasionally, every two years for congressional elections and every four for presidential ones. Because electoral politics is recurring, not ongoing, it gets our attention, and because it gets our attention, we tend to think it’s more important. Americans shouldn’t forget that democratic politics is part of the air we breathe, but unfortunately, we do. And when we forget, I think we become susceptible to ideas that are fundamentally anti-democratic. In the case of third parties, we become susceptible to the idea that we must vote for third party candidates, or not vote at all, if or when the major parties espouse policies that we believe are unconscionable. When it comes to America’s military support of Israel, and Israel’s devastation of the Palestinian people, this appears to be the most common question: How can I get Kamala Harris to change America’s stance – or, if you will, how can I get her to stop supporting genocide – when supporting her gives her reason not to change? Not only is this question common, it appears to be persuasive among young Americans who have little or no feeling for US-Israeli relations. In fact, Kamala Harris struck a new balance at her acceptance speech. By “new,” I mean she put more and better emphasis on the side of the Palestinians than Joe Biden has so far. After describing the horror of the Hamas attacks nearly 10 months ago, Harris said: “What has happened in Gaza … is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again. “The scale of suffering is heartbreaking. President Biden and I are working to end this war, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.” Young people don’t know much, but their ignorance isn’t the problem. The problem is the lessons the rest of us teach them. Somehow, we are teaching them to think that voting is the only means of exercising their democratic power and that the choices on Election Day are their only choices. As a consequence, we are teaching them to see third parties as an expansion of choices when the truth is they are the illusion of it. You throw away a vote and you throw away possibilities and hope. Voting for Jill Stein or any third-party candidate in protest of the Democratic Party’s position on Gaza is going to yield nothing. Third-party candidates, no matter what they say, can’t win. If there’s no winning, there’s no power, and without power, you get nothing for your vote. Nothing, except perhaps victory for the Republican nominee. The immediate impact of third-party candidacies is taking votes from one of the other two presidential candidates. As things stand right now, a vote for Jill Stein is a vote for Donald Trump. But they take more than your money, time and vote. They take your hope. They convince supporters that the system is rigged in favor of the major parties. (It isn’t.) Then, when they lose, and they always lose, the loss seems to prove that third-party candidates were right. Supporters either keep throwing away their votes by sticking with third parties or they throw away their hope by refusing to vote at all. Whenever I write about third parties, I risk being accused of shilling for the Democrats. What I’m actually doing is shilling for democratic politics. I’m reminding people of the choices they already have. If young voters fully understood their true democratic power, rather than seeing it as reduced beyond recognition to one day every two to four years, they might not be so attracted to third parties and their false promises. Third-party candidates want you to believe that your choices are limited and that the system is impossibly rigged against you. They want you to believe that because then, you will need them. In that sense, they are demagogic. They are anti-democratic. Fortunately, there are good people, and good young people, who are refusing to learn bad lessons. They are reminding us that elections are just one of the many productive tools of democratic politics. They are remembering that their choices are not limited by parties but by the creativity they put into solving the problems of a democratic society. For example, one of the Connecticut delegates to the Democratic National Convention is Essam Boraey. He voted “present” in the roll-call vote for Harris’ nomination. He didn’t vote against her but he didn’t vote for her either. During President Joe Biden’s speech last Monday, he held up a banner demanding the US “stop arming Israel.” Though he declined to be interviewed by local news media, his vote and protest made headlines throughout the state. He honored his conscience while seeming to leave room to pressure the party. Swaranjit Singh is another delegate from Connecticut who seems to understand. He has called for a ceasefire, but in his interview with the Connecticut Post, he said: “At least [Harris] included Palestine in her remarks, and the struggle of people … and self-determination, which is big. How are we going to reach that? It’s going to be a lot of work. First thing we have to do is elect her and keep the conversation going.” That’s the way to do it.","summary":"Now that Robert F Kennedy Jr has dropped out, some of his voters appear ready to move their support over to Jill Stein, the Green Party’s candidate.

Still, his father thinks there was potential for more. Curry's father, former NBA guard Dell Curry, is 6-foot-5. Dell pointed out his son's height during a recent episode of their Audible podcast, \"Heat Check with Stephen and Dell Curry.\" \"You were always the smallest, shortest, skinniest kid on all your teams, from 6 years old, 6th grade and all the way up, and I (attribute) that to your mother,\" Dell said in the episode. Steph's mother, Dell's ex-wife, is 5-foot-3. Curry's parents first met at Virginia Tech, where Dell played basketball and Sonya played volleyball. They got married in 1988 and had three children. However, the couple announced their divorce in 2021 after 33 years of marriage. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Dell began his NBA career with the Utah Jazz after being selected with the 15th pick in the 1986 draft, but he was most known for his 10-year stint with the Charlotte Hornets, where he won sixth man of the year in 1994. Despite the three inches Dell had on Steph, the younger Curry had the superior basketball career by a wide margin. However, Steph's height did pose some barriers early on. At Charlotte Christian High School in North Carolina, Steph was named all-conference and all-state and led his team to three conference titles and three state playoff appearances. But he had a hard time getting a scholarship for basketball because of his height. At the time, he hadn't even grown into his 6-foot-2 frame. STEPH CURRY ENDORSES KAMALA HARRIS AFTER SUGGESTING FUTURE PRESIDENTIAL RUN Steph wanted to play at Virginia Tech like his father but was only offered a walk-on spot, partially due to his slender 160-pound frame at the time. He turned that offer down and instead stayed in North Carolina to play at Davidson. Curry has said his size disadvantage is what motivated him to put in extra work to become a stronger player. \"The physicality deficiencies I had early, and, you know, there was always just an encouragement to just work, figure it out, build confidence as you go,\" Steph told Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett during a November 2023 edition of their \"Smartless\" podcast. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"It’s kind of forced upon you just by that’s all you’re in … you’re in a gym all the time. You develop a love for it.\" Steph became the NCAA scoring leader by his junior year at Davidson in 2008-09 and was named a consensus first-team All-American. He was then drafted higher than his father with the No. 7 overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft by the Golden State Warriors, with whom he's won four NBA titles and two NBA MVP awards. Curry won his first Olympic gold medal with an elite shooting performance for the U.S. in the Paris Olympics earlier this month.

The president “never once reached out to any of our families. Kamala Harris has never reached out,” said Cheryl Juels, aunt of Marine Sgt. Nicole Gee; the only person who has reached out to our family over and over again — and all 13 families — is Trump.” The dad of Marine Lance Cpl. Jared Schmitz: “I personally have never heard from Vice President Harris since Day One of her taking office.” And: “We haven’t heard anything from her at all,” said Alicia Lopez, mother of Marine Cpl. Hunter Lopez. “On the contrary, we have received multiple calls and messages from President Trump and his campaign.” Libertarian: Kam’s Tax Cuts Are Really Hikes Kamala Harris vows to cut middle-class taxes, but what’s known about her proposals suggests families will “face a tax hike in a Harris administration — albeit an indirect one,” warns Reason’s Eric Boehm. “Nearly all Americans would face a higher federal tax burden” if Harris follows through on “Biden’s plan for $5 trillion in tax hikes — including a $1.3 trillion increase of the corporate income tax.” Recall, “higher corporate taxes are passed along to consumers, employees, and investors in the form of high prices, lower wages, and lower investment returns.” Yet Donald Trump’s plan for new tariffs also “would cost Americans,” because: Whether you tax corporations or imports, those “taxes are paid by people in the end.” From the right: Durov’s a ‘Hero,’ Not a Villain Since Telegram founder Pavel Durov’s arrest in Paris Saturday, the West has somehow presumed him “guilty,” yet Durov,” roars Shaun Maguire on X, is actually a “hero.” He created “a platform that enabled citizens to communicate with each other transcending borders and autocratic regimes.” Indeed, “Telegram has played an essential role in many pro-democracy protests”; “Durov has been the enemy of autocratic governments his entire adult life. And many Western governments are rapidly descending towards autocracy, so Durov is now their enemy as well.” The charges against him “could be levied against any social media platform.” Alas, liberal values “are under attack in the West to a magnitude that very few people understand.” Elex watch: Dems’ Deceptive Kamala Portrait Democrats have “updated” Mario Cuomo’s adage that “you campaign in poetry” but “govern in prose,” argues The Wall Street Journal’s Gerard Baker: In campaigns, they “present themselves as a kind of idealized version of themselves as mainstream Americans,” seeking merely to bring “unity and compassion” to a nation in need of reform. “Once in office they act as if they have a mandate to remake a benighted country, to reorder an unjust system, to replace American exceptionalism with European social democracy, and to rewrite the nation’s values with the precepts of their cultural Marxism.” Think a President Kamala Harris would resemble the wholesome “Candidate Harris” depicted at last week’s convention? If so, “then it isn’t poetry you’ve been reading. It’s a fairy tale.” Gaza war: Hamas’ Tunnels Are Key The IDF’s rescue of a hostage from a tunnel in Gaza on Monday is “a moment for celebration,” notes Commentary’s Seth Mandel, but also “for a reality check”: The tunnels “remain operational and must continue to be a focus of the war.” Not only does Hamas hide hostages in them; without the tunnels, the terrorists “would be unable to rearm and resupply in perpetuity” across the Gaza-Egypt border, or Philadelphi Corridor. Handing the corridor to Hamas and Egypt means endless war, yet the Biden-Harris folks have been pressing Israel to abandon it. Sorry, but you “are either for Hamas rearmament or you are against it.” The tunnels are “the instruments of rearmament and hostage taking. The Israeli-Palestinian future depends on their dismantlement.” — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"On the third anniversary of Abbey Gate, “several family members of [the] fallen soldiers said that all they’ve gotten in the past three years is radio silence” from the Biden-Harris team, reports National Review’s Audrey Fahlberg.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/27/opinion/crickets-from-harris-biden-kamalas-tax-cuts-are-really-hikes-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/united-states-president-joe-biden-82797177_339505-e1724797591984.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 23:57:54","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.075},{"id":255065360,"title":"Cryptocurrencies tumble amid a wave of long liquidations, bitcoin falls under $60,000","text":"According to CoinGlass, the futures market has seen $93.52 million in long ether liquidations, which forces traders to sell their assets at market price to settle their debts, across centralized exchanges.

Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) proposed in the deal last winter, was still available, potentially rendering meaningless Harris’s sudden willingness to spend money on a border wall. “That February, when we were bringing this up, that’s what we had left — the $650 million,” said Lankford. “The assumption that $650 million is still sitting there, I doubt. I couldn’t tell you I know where it is, but I doubt that that is still sitting there ready to go at this point.” The revelation came after Axios reported Tuesday that a Harris campaign aide disclosed that she would support the bill’s hundreds of millions of dollars to fund more 18- to 30-foot-tall steel barriers at the southern border — projects that were funded by Congress during the Trump administration but not completed. Harris, once running as a liberal Democrat, has been ardently opposed to the border wall in the past. She claimed on multiple occasions while still serving in the Senate that she would block former President Donald Trump’s funding requests to construct new sections of border wall dismissing it as Trump’s “medieval vanity project.” However, the vice president’s 2024 campaign did not directly refute Axios’s Tuesday report indicating the vice president had flip-flopped on constructing a new border wall, and she has grown noticeably more hawkish on the subject of immigration since taking over the top of the Democratic ticket from President Joe Biden in July. At the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago this past week, Harris steadfastly blamed Trump and Republican lawmakers for killing the bipartisan border bill and vowed to, if elected in November, sign that bill into law while simultaneously advancing a legal pathway to citizenship for DREAMers. “I refuse to play politics with our security, and here is my pledge to you,” the vice president declared. “As president, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law.” However, Lankford voiced skepticism to the Washington Examiner that Harris had truly had a change of heart on border wall funding and noted that she and her team had never reached out to him at any time since last fall, including in the days since she stated at the Democratic National Convention last week that she would sign his border deal into law. “She’s definitely not reached out to me, nor anyone on our staff, on this,” said Lankford. Lankford said the bipartisan deal that he spent months brokering with Sinema and Murphy, as well as Biden administration officials including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, was likely not up for consideration any longer. “When you get into 2025, it’s a different moment,” said Lankford. “We have no idea what the border is going to be, and I have no optimism that President Harris would enforce the border any different than President Biden has. But at that point, you’re not going to just take a bill as-is and drop it into a new year and say that’s what it’s going to be.” At the time of the negotiations last fall and into February this year, the number of migrants apprehended by the Border Patrol for entering the United States from Mexico illegally hit an all-time high. Nearly 250,000 illegal immigrants were stopped at the southern border in December 2023, and the bill was drafted to deal with the historic border crisis at hand that has since dramatically changed in terms of demographics crossing. Republicans revolted at news that Harris was supportive of building more border wall and claimed her new position was nothing more than a political play that she would rescind post-election. “San Francisco liberal Kamala Harris’ fake promises to secure the border will never become reality,” said National Republican Congressional Committee press secretary Will Reinert in a statement. “The same Kamala who wanted to abolish ICE and decriminalize illegal border crossings will cave to House Democrats’ open-border demands.” A spokeswoman for Trump knocked Harris’s behind-the-scenes policy pivot as “preposterous.” “Kamala’s RECORD proves she is pro-open border. She called the wall ‘un-American,’ a ‘waste of taxpayer money,’ ‘medieval,’ and said it isn’t going to ‘stop’ illegal immigration,” said Karoline Leavitt, Trump’s campaign press secretary. “How much longer will the mainstream media allow Kamala Harris to hide and use staff to speak on her behalf? It’s DAY 37 of ZERO interviews and Kamala’s anonymous campaign sources are now claiming she supports President Trump’s border wall.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Conservative-leaning Heritage Action for America Executive Vice President Ryan Walker chastised Harris’s “flip-flop.” “Kamala Harris’ newfound support for the border wall is the latest flip-flop of many in her fledgling campaign, which just goes to show she’s a phony that will do anything to get in power,” Walker said in a statement.","summary":"EXCLUSIVE — The bipartisan Senate border package that Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign has promised to support if she is elected president is unlikely to be revived, according to the Republican senator who negotiated the deal.

The Office of US Special Counsel Jack Smith has filed a revised indictment against former US President Donald Trump regarding claims of interference in the 2020 presidential election. The move follows the high court’s decision finding Trump partially immune from prosecution. The updated indictment features the same charges accusing the Republican presidential hopeful of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 vote, Smith specified. Trump dismissed the new indictment as an attempt to divert the attention of the US electorate from the catastrophes inflicted on the country by the current administration. \"This is merely an attempt to interfere with the election, and distract the American people from the catastrophes [Vice President] Kamala Harris has inflicted on our nation, like the border invasion, migrant crime, rampant inflation, the threat of World War III, and more…,\" Trump wrote on his page on Truth Social.","summary":"The updated indictment features the same charges accusing the Republican presidential hopeful of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 vote","url":"https://tass.com/world/1834815","image":"https://cdn-media.tass.ru/width/1200_4ce85301/tass/m2/en/uploads/i/20240828/1426871.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 23:51:26","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.297},{"id":255063878,"title":"Kamala’s 180 on the border wall is the latest idea she stole from Trump","text":"Welcome to the Trump Train . . . Kamala Harris? After years of slamming former President Donald Trump’s plan to build a wall along the southern border, Harris is subtly co-opting his message to sell herself as a border hawk. At her DNC speech, Harris pledged to bring back the border security bill killed in the Senate last year, which pledges hundreds of millions of dollars to expand the border wall, and sign it into law if elected. And she used photos of already-built sections of the wall in an ad touting her record as a “border-state prosecutor.” Harris hated the wall until about five seconds ago; in 2017, she called it a “stupid use of money” and vowed to “block any funding for it.” In 2019, she slammed the “medieval vanity project” and promised, “I’m not going to vote for a wall under any circumstances.” And of course she was border czar in an administration that literally sold off the not-yet-used wall-building material it inherited. But now she’s facing an electorate furious over the millions of illegal immigrants waved in by the Biden-Harris administration. In 2024, 35% of voters see the border crisis as the country’s No. 1 issue, and a majority of Americans (53%) support a border wall. So Harris wants to look like she does, too. That’s not the only MAGA idea she’s cribbed: She copy/pasted the “no taxes on tips” policy that Trump has been speaking about at rallies since June; she’s also proposed a $6,000 child tax credit, embracing an idea the left had been slamming Sen. J.D. Vance for. Meanwhile, nearly every day some Harris aide says (mostly anonymously — why?) the candidate no longer holds one or another past (on the record) position, whether it’s the fracking ban she’s long wanted or the major price controls she announced this month. Tuesday, top campaign aide Ammar Moussa blast-emailed the “news” that Harris doesn’t want to ban non-electric cars . . . though as proof she only cited Biden administration policies, without actually disavowing the bills Harris backed in the Senate to outlaw them as soon as 2035. Harris’ plan for winning in November sure seems to involve going MAGA. Or at least Trump-ifying just enough to convince Americans she has the cure for the ills that her administration caused. It’s all bull: Even if she dons a MAGA cap, all she has below it are the dysfunctional policies of the Biden-Harris years. Even with most of the media eager to help sell her supposed transformation, this Kameleon strategy is pure spin on a Biden 2.0 agenda.","summary":"After years of slamming former President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the southern border, Kamala Harris is co-opting his message to sell herself as a border hawk.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/27/opinion/kamala-harris-border-wall-pivot-copies-donald-trump/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-copen7so9-1724801444745.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1724787151&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 23:50:08","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":255064418,"title":"Trump selling pieces of ‘knockout suit’ he wore at debate for under $1,500 as he touts ‘piece of presidential history’","text":"ALTHOUGH Donald Trump may have pivoted to politics, he's reminding supporters of his roots as a businessman with his latest sale.

Trump and Biden debated one another on June 27, hosted by CNN moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash.

Biden failed to ease concerns he could beat Trump in November, and calls quickly came from Democrats for him to step aside. He stood firm in his intent to run and chalked up his debate performance to a \"bad night.\" Biden explained that he was exhausted from previously traveling for the anniversary of D-Day in France and the G7 meeting in Italy. \"I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth,\" he reiterated at a rally soon after in North Carolina. However, after multiple appearances in the press and a continued push on the campaign, Biden ended his bid for re-election on July 21 in a letter to the nation. Vice President Kamala Harris quickly stepped in as the Democratic nominee and formally accepted the nomination at the Democratic National Convention on August 22. ROUND 2?

Politifact tracked 15 false statements Trump made, while the New York Times cited 20 and another 21 that were misleading or lacked context. The Associated Press corrected 11 false statements from Trump and four from Biden. In comparison, Politifact pointed out three false statements from Biden, and the New York Times found zero. While Biden has dropped out of the race, Trump will have another chance to prove his debating skills against a new challenger.

A fact that Offerman made crystal today about Donald Trump once again on YouTube with a new version of his “Proud to Be a Kamala Man” song. Performed from the POV of a GOP voter who has had enough of Trump’s “cons and lies/ the rapes and rants,” the tune is a slicker mix of the song Offerman offered up on the virtual Comics for Kamala fundraiser earlier this month. “I am very enthusiastic to be supporting the presidential campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz,” Offerman says in an intro to the song and its video of Trump’s greatest fails. “For obvious reasons, there are a lot of Republicans who are suddenly very Kamala curious,” the actor who played a MAGA man in Ava DuVernay‘s Origins last year adds. “There are all these organizations of Republicans for Kamala, and it’s very exciting.” “Without further ado, let me offer you a song that’s from the point of view of one of these Republicans, one of these good citizens who formerly was a little bit, blinded by misinformation, who has now found their way to see clear to decency.” Hear and see Offerman’s “Proud to Be a Kamala Man” here The music of the self-described and tongue firmly cheek song may sound a lot like Trump fave Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA”, but the lyrics from Offerman and Mark Rivers are as anti-MAGA as you can get. With lines like ‘Cuz there’s no denyin’/Trump’s a f*cking d*ck” and “Kamala’s got momentum, and that lady she’s no quitter/Plus, she never hid nuclear secrets in the Mar-a-Lago shitter,” Offerman puts all his cards on the table – as you can hear above Having picked up almost 26,000 views in the past 10 hours since the new and improved “Proud to Be a Kamala Man ends with a “Donate Today KamalaHarris.com” slate. The fact that the Kamala song is still available online is a little odd. Offerman’s original and more low-fi version was posted on YouTube back in first week of August after the $530,000 raising Comics for Kamala event. It was quickly pulled down due to a “copyright claim from Greenwood Legacy Music.” In an election that has seen the former Celebrity Apprentice host’s campaign hit again and again by artists like Celine Dion and the Foo Fighters wanting the ex-POTUS not to use their music, the fact that ‘Proud to Be a Kamala Man” 2.0 has been taken down is surprising. Deadline reached out to reps for Greenwood, who performed over all four nights of the RNC back in July. Nothing yet. However, if and when we do get a response this post will be updated. And yes, using the description Democratic VP nominee Walz has popularised on the GOP ticket, there is a “weird” in there. Case in point: “And J.D.

Vance, Donald Trump’s 2024 running mate, went on to slam American Federation of Teachers boss Randi Weingarten, insisting: “[S]he doesn’t have a single child. If she wants to brainwash and destroy the minds of children, she should have some of her own and leave ours the hell alone.\" The freshman senator, Yale-educated lawyer and former venture capitalist, first lobbed a widely derided slur about women who had never given birth during a 2021 interview with then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson. He lamented that the US was under the control of “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” Vance went on to slam Vice President and Democratic presidential contender Kamala Harris, Transportation Secretray Pete Buttigieg, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a cabal “without children,” who shouldn’t be making decisions for others. “How does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?” Vance asked Carlson. Vance didn’t limit the “cat ladies” insult to women, either. Also in 2021, Vance took aim at economist Paul Krugman, tweeting: “Paul Krugman is one of many weird cat ladies who have too much power in our country. We should change this.” Vance has also argued that those without children should pay higher taxes and have diminished voting rights. His offensive remarks have been met with outrage along with people sharing their personal stories. Former Democratic Rep.

Tim Walz, had tried and failed to conceive via IVF. “To suggest we are somehow lesser is disgraceful,” Giffords posted. Actress Jennifer Aniston also slammed Vance for his insensitivity to women struggling to conceive, posting to social media that she hoped Vance’s own daughter is “fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.” “I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option,” Aniston said. “Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.” Vance responded and called Aniston’s take “disgusting.” At the Democratic National Convention earlier this month, Oprah Winfrey made a dig at Vance by saying that if a house was on fire that happened to belong to a “childless cat lady,” she’d still try to save her and her pet. On Sunday, Vance tried to walk back his comments, saying during an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press: “I made a sarcastic comment years ago that I think that a lot of Democrats have willfully misinterpreted.” He said he had “a lot of regrets,” but that “a joke three years ago is not at the top 10 of the list.”","summary":"Republican vice presidential candidate made offensive remarks at a 2021 Center for Christian Virtue forum","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jd-vance-kamala-harris-childless-cat-ladies-trump-b2602793.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/25/17/vance_mtp_august.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xPMau62d-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-27 23:37:39","author":"Justin Rohrlich","authors":["Justin Rohrlich"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.484},{"id":255065154,"title":"Behind the DNC’s Trojan horse campaign","text":"Last week, Democrat power players delivered a succession of self-congratulatory speeches at the Democratic National Convention, riddled with the-best-is-yet-to-come buzzwords like “change,” “joy,” and even “wonderfully magical.” After Democrats dethroned our incoherent sitting president, these self-described “defenders of democracy” have installed Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic Party ticket — without a single voter casting a ballot to put her there. Biden may be out of touch and incompetent, but the dangerously liberal Harris-Walz ticket is the most extreme ever to get so close to the presidency. The convention quickly disposed of Biden on the first night. It was hard to find anyone who seemed to remember that Kamala Harris has been helping him create crisis after crisis for the past four years. “Hope is making a comeback,” Michelle Obama told the convention audience. Which raises the question: Where has hope been over the last four years of Harris’ administration? It’s not 2008. We don't need you to articulate the Democrat dreamscape; most of us are already living the nightmare after your party reigned for 12 of the past 16 years. In her acceptance speech, Harris spoke as if she has not already been in office for more than 1,000 days. She wants Americans to forget that she has the power to act, negotiate legislation, and “unite” us as she promised — right now. Why hasn’t she done that already? She’s asking voters for a huge promotion but failed to mention her job performance so far. Despite attempts from Democratic Party puppeteers to shelter Harris from the press and veil her radical policy platforms, it has become increasingly clear that Biden has not been in control for some time, meaning Harris has been in the driver’s seat of this disastrous administration. Worse still, the socialist record of her pick for vice president, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, shows her administration would move our country even farther to the left — not toward the center as her shrouded campaign would have voters believe. Biden may be out of touch and incompetent, but the dangerously liberal Harris-Walz ticket is the most extreme ever to get so close to the presidency. There are so many far-left and unpopular policies in their arsenal that it’s hard to decide where to start. First, since Joe Biden put her in charge of the border — a fact Democrats are trying to bury or deny — Harris has overseen the worst invasion in U.S. history. As governor, Walz handed out driver’s licenses, free health care, and taxpayer-funded college tuition to illegal immigrants. Harris promised to ban fracking — putting hundreds of thousands of people out of work and driving energy prices even higher, all to appease climate alarmists. Meanwhile, Walz has pushed for Minnesota to copy California’s radical vehicle emission standards that will enrich China, kneecap the state’s auto industry, and empower bureaucrats over the free market. Harris and Walz, both vocal proponents of “Medicare for all,” argue for eliminating private health insurance entirely. This would force all Americans into government-run health care plans, causing many to lose their doctors and forcing hospitals to operate with the same efficiency as DMVs. And despite student performance declining on his watch, Walz staunchly opposes parental rights and school choice, blocking parents from choosing the best education for their children and preventing students from having the best opportunities to succeed. As a teachers’ union darling, Walz kept Minnesota schools closed for months in response to COVID-19, even though data had proven it was safe to put kids back in classrooms. The following year, just 45% of Minnesota students were proficient in math, a 10-point drop after Walz took office. In a manner similar to corrupt Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Harris and Walz are radically pro-criminal. As California’s attorney general, Harris opposed the state’s “three strikes” law that keeps violent criminals in jail and worked to end cash bail, putting more criminals back on the street. As a U.S. senator in 2020, Harris helped bail out dangerous Black Lives Matter rioters. Meanwhile, Walz wants murderers and rapists to vote. He signed a bill allowing convicted felons to vote before completing their probation or parole. There is nothing joyous, liberating, or “wonderfully magical” about the possibility of a Harris-Walz regime. As their record shows, they want to concentrate power and expand federal control over virtually every aspect of American life. Americans are already feeling the repercussions of Harris and Walz’s progressive policies. Even DNC “freedom” branding can’t mask the most extensive overreach of federal power to date. Harris’ Trojan horse campaign will continue to hide behind rich celebrities, cringey memes, and happy talk from the Obamas — but Americans should know the dangers of what Kamala Harris is attempting to slip through the gates of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.","summary":"Last week, Democrat power players delivered a succession of self-congratulatory speeches at the Democratic National Convention, riddled with the-best-is-yet-to-come buzzwords like “change,” “joy,” and even “wonderfully magical.”\n\n\n\n\tAfter Democrats dethroned our incoherent sitting president, these self-described “defenders of democracy” have installed Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic Party ticket — without a single voter casting a ballot to put her there.\n\n\n\n\tBiden may be out of touch and incompetent, but the dangerously liberal Harris-Walz ticket is the most extreme ever to get so close to the presidency.\n\n\n\n\tThe convention quickly disposed of Biden on the first night.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Niomi Harris For Mailonline Published:23:34 BST, 27 August 2024 |Updated:00:29 BST, 28 August 2024 e-mail 4 View comments Linda Nolan has given a heartbreaking cancer update, revealing that her tumours have 'grown' as her treatment has 'stopped working'. The singer, 65, was first diagnosed with stage-three breast cancer in 2005 before getting the all-clear in 2006. But in 2017 she was diagnosed with a form of incurable secondary cancer in her hip, which spread to her liver in 2020. Last year, she shared the news that the cancer had spread to her brain, with two tumours discovered on the left side of her brain which left her struggling with her speech and balance. However, while the disease appeared to be stable in Linda's recent updates, her latest prognosis has revealed the devastating news that two of her largest tumours has grown in size, while further cancer spots have been found. In a new interview, Linda admitted she was left 'sobbing' as the doctor delivered the results, saying how she wished cancer would just 'leave her alone.' Linda Nolan has given a heartbreaking cancer update, revealing that her tumours have 'grown' as her treatment has 'stopped working' The singer, 65, was first diagnosed with stage-three breast cancer in 2005 before getting the all-clear in 2006. But in 2017 she was diagnosed with a form of incurable secondary cancer in her hip, which spread to her liver in 2020 She told The Mirror: 'I sobbed when my consultant first told me. I know so many people are suffering and going through things, but I thought, just for once, could cancer just leave me alone? My heart sank.' Detailing how she suspected something was amiss beforehand, she said: 'I had feared something was wrong. My balance has been getting worse and my memory - my sisters have to prompt me when I get lost in the middle of a sentence.' Linda told how she was accompanied by sister Maureen and her MacMillan nurse at the appointment and immediately asked her consultant if the cancer had spread. After it was confirmed, she told how she then enquired straight away what the next course of treatment would be. The Nolans star is set to start on a new course of treatment on Wednesday which will include the life-extending breast cancer drug Enhertu - which is not currently available on the health service in England after its manufacturers and the NHS spending watchdog failed to reach an agreement on price. Linda said of the treatment: 'To be able to try a new drug is amazing, I just wish everyone could have this opportunity. To be able to try this is hope - it’s a plan B not everyone is being allowed. To take this drug away from women is to take away their hope.' But while Linda welcomes the new drug, the singer is dreading the side-effects after medics informed her it was a 'possibility' that she'll lose her hair - which will be the fifth time for Linda amid her years of chemotherapy. The brave star is trying to keep a positive outlook however as she insisted that she's 'ready to try anything', declaring that as she's done tis before, she can 'do it again'. In Linda's recent updates, her latest prognosis has revealed the devastating news that two of her largest tumours has grown in size, while further cancer spots have been found 'I sobbed when my consultant first told me. I know so many people are suffering and going through things, but I thought, just for once, could cancer just leave me alone? My heart sank' (pictured with sister Anne in August 2020) In April, Linda revealed that she's always 'keen to squeeze the most out of life' amid her cancer battle. Read More Coleen Nolan checks thoroughly for cancer every day after its tragic effect on her family In an interview she has told how her main focus is 'making memories' with her family and filling up her schedule with happy plans. She told The Mirror that since her birthday celebrations in February her and the family have had a stream of 'knees-ups' including her niece Amy's birthday, her sister Coleen's birthday and St Patrick's celebrations. Linda told the publication: 'The WhatsApps are flying. Like I said to my counsellor, it's a funny life in my head. Never mind tumours, it sometimes feels like I have worms wriggling in there. 'I'm constantly so keen to squeeze the most out of life; to make memories, to enjoy every second, and to ensure everyone enjoys their time with me. In April, Linda revealed that she's always 'keen to squeeze the most out of life' amid her cancer battle This week I'm realising perhaps I'm putting too much pressure on it all. Can you have too much fun? Nah. But life doesn't stop teaching you lessons, does it? And just when you think you have this cancer malarkey all figured out.' Just days ago, Linda's sister Coleen said it has become a daily ritual for her to check for signs of cancer everyday after the tragic effects the disease has had on her family. The Loose Women presenter, who is one if six sisters, candidly admitted she is terrified she will be the family member targeted by the disease next. Cancer has significantly affected the Nolan family after the sisters lost Bernie, 52, in 2013 after a three year battle with breast cancer. Meanwhile both Anne, 73, and Linda have also both battled breast cancer. Speaking to The Mirror Coleen opened up about the preventative measures she takes as she explained: 'We have had so much heartache... I'm always checking. I still have this thing when I think, \"What if I have missed it?\" Just days ago, Linda's sister Coleen said it has become a daily ritual for her to check for signs of cancer everyday after the tragic effects the disease has had on her family Cancer has significantly affected the Nolan family after the sisters lost Bernie, 52, in 2013 after a three year battle with breast cancer. Meanwhile both Anne, 73, and Linda, 65, have also both battled breast cancer In 2013, Bernie Nolan passed away after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010, and despite being given the all-clear the disease returned in 2012 'Whenever I'm in the shower, I will have a good feel and check and if there is ever a time when I think \"I don't like that\", I will go to the doctor straight away. And they will say \"It's fine, it's a little cyst or an infection\". While Coleen hopes she doesn't get the disease, she explained that if she is unfortunate she wants to catch it early. Revealing how much she spends on health care, she admitted: 'My breast specialist is £225 a year. People say, \"It's all right for you, you've got money\". But you could probably spend that in a year on takeaways, down the pub or on cigarettes.' The TV star pays for regular appointments with a breast specialist, in addition to her NHS mammogram every two years.

Now that’s funny","text":"It’s official. The Harris-Biden administration is a joke. And none of us should be laughing. On Monday, Facebook founder and Meta honcho Mark Zuckerberg revealed some unfunny truths in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). “In 2021, senior officials from the Biden Administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain Covid-19 content, including humor and satire, and expressed a lot of frustration with our teams when we didn’t agree,” wrote Zuckerberg, who, as of late, seems to be exhibiting signs of early onset red-pilling. Trying to suppress political satire is a dangerous knock at the First Amendment, and an insult to our American values. Kamala Harris owns this dystopian overreach. This, however, isn’t the first we’ve learned of this current administration’s plot to make America glum again with digital censorship. Joy, we hardly knew ye. In 2023, Jordan released information that the Biden White House’s Senior Advisor Andy Slavitt, who left his job in June 2021, demanded Facebook remove a hyper-viral, vaccine-critical meme. It was a shot of Leonardo DiCaprio from “Once Upon A Time in Hollywood,” pointing at the television and, essentially, saying how in 10 years’ time, we’ll be seeing ambulance-chasing law firm commercials targeting vaccine recipients who may be entitled to compensation. Slavitt was outraged and reportedly said the post “was directly comparing Covid vaccines to asbestos poisoning in a way that demonstrably inhibits confidence amongst those the Biden administration is trying to reach.” We won two world wars and defeated communism, but a meme is too scary and potent. This effort to disappear a topical joke displayed a low regard for Americans’ intelligence — and the administration’s own appetite for authoritarianism. But to see it in black and white, in Zuckerberg’s own words, is particularly jarring: The White House wanted to kill not just something they viewed as covid disinformation (what a dumb word), but also humor that chipped away the left’s stranglehold on a narrative that subjugated us. Or maybe just gave us a chuckle. A narrative that sowed fear, justified prolonged school closures, destroyed businesses and, in some cases, required people to take a vaccine just to retain their job. It’s criminally unfunny. Humor and satire are necessary parts of a free and functioning society. They help us deal with our crappy lives and unspeakable tragedies. They unify and disarm. And, when deployed in a searing, effective way, they hold a mirror up to our society’s absurdities, poking holes in our overlords’ worst impulses. It’s been most necessary this last decade or so, especially as our culture has become an epic pile-up of lunacy. We masked little kids and were mandated to stand 6 feet apart, a figure that Anthony Fauci now admits was pulled out of his hiney. Tall strapping males like Lia Thomas called themselves girls and joined women’s college swim and cycling competitions. We were supposed to revere trans athletes for their bravery, and threatened with ruin should we point out the obvious farce. And wealthy white women like Robin DiAngelo — now an accused plagiarist — made a boatload of cash lecturing corporations about racial equity. In another era, all of these would be fresh ingredients for the best episodes of “Saturday Night Live” or “In Living Color.” But as the once funny left developed sacred cows, people have been canceled for daring to say the obvious. Or blasted for exercising the smallest bit of critical thinking skills — even if was cloaked in yuks. Just ask Jon Stewart, who applied logic on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” in 2021. In the now infamous appearance, Stewart — the 2022 recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor (yes we have one of those) — hilariously said it was obvious the virus came from the Wuhan lab, adding: “The disease is the same name as the lab!” Or Woody Harrelson’s gonzo “SNL” monologue in 2023, which took aim at the virus and vaccines. That led to a fierce tsk-tsk from the mainstream media, with many dismissing it as dangerous conspiracies. And still, humor has been a lifeboat in a rising tide of woke-ism. Efforts at suppression, mostly by our now scoldy cultural institutions, have forged a thriving and edgy comedy scene — Andrew Schulz, Shane Gillis, Tim Dillon— as well as a handful of hard-charging podcasts, like Tony Hinchliffe’s “Kill Tony” and Ryan Long’s sketches that reliably ridicule our obsession with identity and politics. And look at what happened in 2022, when Twitter suspended the account of the sharp satire site the Babylon Bee for the high crime of misgendering HHS second-in-command, Dr. Rachel Levine, a biological man who transitioned in 2011. As a rejoinder to USA Today naming Levine “Woman of the Year,” they awarded the doctor “Man of the Year.” It set off a firestorm and meaningful discussion about free speech. And truth. And it also helped push Elon Musk to buy Twitter, though not without many tears from the ultra progressives who once ruled the platform with a castigating iron fist. Eventually, the people will have the last laugh.","summary":"We won two world wars and defeated communism, but a jokey meme was too scary and potent for the White House.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/27/opinion/biden-admin-tried-to-censor-covid-19-satire-now-thats-funny/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/censorship_720.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=720","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 23:27:31","author":"Kirsten Fleming","authors":["Kirsten Fleming"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.024},{"id":255065388,"title":"Trump, Kamala Harris Agree To Mute Mics For September 10 Debate","text":"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Tuesday an agreement has been reached to have closed microphones at the Sept. 10 U.S. presidential debate with Democratic rival Kamala Harris. The Harris campaign did not immediately return a request for confirmation about the ABC-hosted debate. The candidates campaigns clashed on Monday over the previously agreed-upon debate, with the vice president's team seeking a return to open microphones while Trump threatened to pull out entirely after suggesting the network was biased. In a social media post on Tuesday, Trump said the rules for next month's debate will be the same as they were for the June CNN debate he had with President Joe Biden, whose poor performance led him to drop out of the 2024 race. \"The Debate will be 'stand up,' and Candidates cannot bring notes, or 'cheat sheets.' We have also been given assurance by ABC that this will be a 'fair and equitable' Debate, and that neither side will be given the questions in advance,\" Trump wrote. The CNN debate did not have a live audience. Trump's post did not mention that. Harris' campaign had said it wanted the broadcaster to keep the candidates' microphones on throughout the event, not muted when their opponent was speaking as in the last presidential debate. So-called \"hot mics\" can help or hurt political candidates, catching offhand comments that sometimes were not meant for the public. While Trump's team said it had already agreed to have closed microphones, Trump later told reporters that he preferred to have his microphone kept on. Trump's campaign has floated an additional debate on Sept. 4 on Fox News network but the Harris team rejected that.

The new Grand Jury indictment comes after the Supreme Court granted Trump some “immunity” from criminal prosecution for his “official actions in office.” Meanwhile, a group of more than 200 Republicans who worked for President George W Bush and senators John McCain and Mitt Romney have endorsed Harris for president over Trump.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump described the updated indictment as an effort by Smith to bring back “a dead” witch hunt, and added that the updated superseding indictment had “all the problems of the old indictment,” and “should be dismissed.” Trump’s post comes after a Washington, D.C. grand jury returned a superseding indictment with four charges: conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. “In an effort to resurrect a ‘dead’ Witch Hunt in Washington, D.C., in an act of desperation, and in order to save face, the illegally appointed ‘Special Counsel’ Deranged Jack Smith, has brought a ridiculous new Indictment against me, which has all the problems of the old Indictment, and should be dismissed IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote. Trump noted that Smith’s “Florida Document Hoax Case” had been dismissed, and the updated superseding indictment was “an attempt to interfere with the election.” In July, a Florida judge tossed out a documents case against Trump, ruling that Smith was not appointed constitutionally or in a lawful manner. “This is merely an attempt to INTERFERE WITH THE ELECTION, and distract the American People from the catastrophes Kamala Harris has inflicted on our Nation, like the Border Invasion, Migrant Crime, Rampant Inflation, the threat of World War III, and more,” Trump added. The four charges are the same charges Smith had previously brought against Trump. In response to the Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity in July, some aspects of the indictment were taken out and changed. “The superseding indictment, which was presented to a new grand jury that had not previously heard evidence in this case, reflects the Government’s efforts to respect and implement the Supreme Court’s holdings and remand instructions in Trump v. United States,” Smith wrote in a court document.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump criticized Special Counsel Jack Smith for filing a superseding indictment with the same four charges Trump was originally charged with regarding alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\n\nThe post Trump Responds to Jack Smith Filing Superseding Indictment: &#8216;Should Be Dismissed&#8217; appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/08/27/trump-responds-to-jack-smith-filing-superseding-indictment-should-be-dismissed/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/08/Donald-Trump-and-Jack-Smith-640x335.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 23:15:37","author":"Elizabeth Weibel","authors":["Elizabeth Weibel"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.033},{"id":255064206,"title":"Strictly's Kai Widdrington 'will NOT be paired with a celebrity partner in 2024 series' in latest blow to scandal hit BBC show","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Wednesday, Aug 28th 2024 1AM 14°C 4AM 13°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Pregnant Barbie actress Margot Robbie looks swell in unbuttoned white shirt as she enjoys sweet babymoon with husband Tom Ackerley in Sardinia 'It defies justice': Murder victim Zara Aleena's family tell of their horror as female prison worker, 33, is charged with having an 'inappropriate relationship' with the man serving 38 years for killing the law graduate Linda Nolan shares heartbreaking cancer update as she reveals her tumours have 'grown' after her treatment 'stopped working' Peloton's former billionaire CEO reveals he's 'lost all his money' and is selling his possessions - as he breaks his silence on Sex and the City debacle The tricks one driver used to slash an astonishing £18,601 off their car insurance... and how you can do the same Science shows this supplement really can slow down ageing and experts are excited.

The professional dancer, 29 - who was paired with Angela Rippon in the 2023 series - is said to be 'gutted' over the decision made. The BBC have decided to bench the Strictly star, who split from girlfriend Nadiya Bychkova in June, in the latest blow to the scandal hit show. Although he was confirmed to be returning to the series, Kai has been forced to step down from the competition due to the small amount of female celebrities taking part. He will still take part in the group dances. In this year's line-up, only six women will compete against nine men - a first in the show's history. Kai Widdrington, 29, 'will not be paired with a celebrity partner' in the upcoming 2024 series, according to new reports The professional dancer - who was paired with Angela Rippon (pictured) in the 2023 series - is said to be 'gutted' over the decision made A source told The Sun: 'Kai has become the first casualty of this year’s male-heavy line-up. With so few female celebrities it was inevitable that some of the professionals would miss out on a pairing, but it’s a real blow that Kai is one of them. 'He had a great run last series with Angela and is a fan favourite. But, just like last year with Nadiya when she wasn’t given a partner, bosses have to look at a number of factors when choosing which dancer to pair with which celebrity. 'They look at everything from height through to chemistry tests to see who will work best together and it’s meant Kai has missed out. He will be part of the group dances alongside other males who haven’t been selected this year.' MailOnline have contacted Kai and Strictly Come Dancing for a comment. The male-heavy line-up follow a flurry of bullying allegations after Amanda Abbington and Zara McDermott spoke about their experiences in rehearsals. This year, Giovanni Pernice, 33, and Graziano Di Prima were on the receiving end of allegations they had mistreated their celebrity dance partners. Giovanni has vehemently denied any wrongdoing while Graziano, 30, initially confirmed and regretted his actions against Zara. The identities of the contestants competing in series 22 of Strictly, beginning in September, were unveiled from August 5. It comes after it was confirmed that a verdict on the Giovanni-Amanda Abbington row is expected to be announced within days. But the BBC have decided to bench the Strictly star, who split from girlfriend Nadiya Bychkova (pictured) in June, in the latest blow to the scandal hit show Although he was confirmed to be returning to the series, Kai has been forced to step down from the competition due to the small amount of female celebrities taking part (pictured with Angela last year) This year, Giovanni Pernice and Graziano Di Prima were on the receiving end of allegations they had mistreated their celebrity dance partners Giovanni has vehemently denied any wrongdoing while Graziano initially confirmed and regretted his actions against Zara The Strictly scandal erupted when Sherlock actress Amanda quit the show in 2023. She claimed that her dancing partner Giovanni was abusive towards her which led to her later quitting the show. In July, Graziano was sacked, accused of 'kicking' his celebrity dancing partner Love Island star Zara McDermott during their time together.

Bob Casey dodges question about Harris’ fracking flip-flop","text":"Kamala Harris’ fracking flip-flop could spell trouble for Pennsylvania Democrat Sen. Bob Casey, who dodged rather than defended the VP on the issue, which is key to Keystone State voters. At a press conference in Philly earlier this month, The Post asked Casey about Harris’ frenzied position on hydraulic fracking, a practice that supports more than 5% of Pennsylvania’s workforce, per analysis from the American Petroleum Institute. “I’ll let the vice president speak to it herself,” Casey replied, adding that she’ll have plenty of opportunities to answer for herself on the issue at the plentiful Pennsylvania visits she has upcoming. “It’s clear to me that she has a position that would ensure that we don’t have fracking bans like some have proposed in Congress. I’ve always opposed, and will continue to oppose,” the senator added. Last month, Harris’ campaign claimed that she is no longer in favor of banning fracking — a major policy reversal. Prior to becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, she adamantly opposed it, telling CNN in 2019: “There is no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.” The fracking issue has become front-and-center in must-win Pennsylvania, where 85% of voters support more domestic oil and gas production. Casey’s GOP challenger Dave McCormick has been campaigning on Harris’ fracking foibles, running an ad featuring Harris telling a TV interviewer that fossil fuel industry workers should have “an ability to transition,” should the fracking ban she once favored take place. At the Democratic National Convention last week, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro defended Harris’ change of heart on this hot-button issue in an interview with CBS News. “Kamala Harris did say that in 2019. And then she showed up in Pennsylvania a whole bunch, she listened to people, and she has made clear that now she wants to continue natural gas extractions. She wants to continue to help Pennsylvania be a leader when it comes to energy production,” he said, referencing the five year old comments from her Democratic primary debate. “I appreciate the fact that she listened and I appreciate the fact that her position evolved,” Shapiro added. Shapiro is a popular purple state governor who has become a major Harris booster in his must-win swing state, so giving the veep a pass on her fracking flip-flop may just absolve her of her sins with Pennsylvanians. But not with Brianna Howard, the mayor of Mount Jewett, Pa. and a member of 4th generation family-owned-and-operated oil and gas company, who told The Post the VP is merely a shill for the green energy agenda. “Harris’ constant flip-flopping and backtracking on fracking is a reminder that she knows how important our American energy industry is, but because she’s a puppet of the climate alarmists who seek to impose their radical ‘green energy’ agenda on every day Americans, she refuses to acknowledge the necessity of fracking.” With 70 days to go, the presidential race in Pennsylvania is in a near dead-heat. Emerson College Polling released Friday showed Trump narrowly leading Harris in the state, 49% to 48%.","summary":"Kamala Harris' fracking flip-flop could spell trouble for Pennsylvania Democrat Sen.

The Minnesota governor hit peak Midwestern Dad stride on the show Subway Takes. Hosted by Kareem Rahma, video clips involve asking people on the New York subway to share their opinions on something that may be controversial or unpopular. “My take is the most neglected part of home ownership is the gutters,” Kamala Harris running mate said. “It’s personal for me.” “I’ve had problems with gutters before, you get your basement wet, you get ice dams,” he added. “It caused a lot of problems.” Walz then lauded the beauty of Minnesota in the fall before discussing the dangers of gutter maintenance. “I’ve seen many a man fall off a ladder,” Rahma said. The VP nominee went on to recommend a “gutter helmet” to prevent leaves from getting into the troughs. “I try not to be judgemental on people, but when I see a well-tended gutter, it says a lot about somebody,” Walz said to laughter from Rahma. When asked if he preferred a well-tended lawn or having the gutters taken care of, Walz didn’t hesitate. “I’d go with the gutters ... I think gutters are a big thing, that they really matter,” he said. The top comment on the video is from Walz himself: “Gutter helmets. Trust me on this one.” The Harris campaign on TikTok called Walz, “America’s dad.” “Name a person in the White House in the last 20 years that has personally taken care of gutters. I love this guy,” one commenter wrote. Harris Deputy Campaign Manager Rob Flaherty shared the Subway Takes episode on X, where it quickly won more than a million views. “80/20 odds at this point they put Walz on Hot Ones,” one user said. “There has never been a more dad-coded man than Tim Walz. Pure,” podcaster Patrick Wyman wrote. “VP Walz is 100 percent going to be on a scissor lift at the Naval Observatory cleaning gutters next year,” another account holder said.","summary":"‘My take is the most neglected part of home ownership is the gutters,’ Democratic vice presidential nominee advised on Subway Takes","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/tim-walz-kamala-harris-2024-b2602666.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/27/21/SEI218291516.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mrXN5kfu-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-27 23:01:15","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.098},{"id":255063298,"title":"Letters: Commander-in-chief | Criticism to strength | Reintroduce reason | Attacking Gus | Israel support | Global status","text":"Trump is proven poor commander-in-chief An American president’s main duty — some say their only duty — is to protect the nation. Donald Trump has totally disqualified himself from ever being commander-in-chief. He has displayed open contempt for current service personnel, veterans and their families; reduced veterans’ aid; debased and ignored intelligence services; has an affinity for enemies; weakened alliances; and vowed to use the military to suppress dissent at home and to round up immigrants for deportation. Military personnel swear an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, not trample it. Put country ahead of partisan politics. William Briggs Morgan Hill Harris could turn criticism to strength Many people agree that Kamala Harris has an uphill battle against Donald Trump. There is less time for her to communicate her agenda. She promised an opportunity economy where everyone has an opportunity to compete and a chance to succeed. She has reclaimed the freedom mantle away from the GOP. Harris has promised to restore abortion rights and tackle gun violence, pollution and climate change. Two areas where she may be vulnerable are immigration and inflation. She mentioned that after the bipartisan bill on curtailing border crossings was ready, Trump asked GOP senators to reject it. Already, with the current policy of shutting down asylum acceptance, the border crossings have gone even lower than when Trump was in office. Since the last presidential election, food prices have gone up 26%. This is an area where her promise of investigating price gouging can be used. This is not price control. Mohan Raj San Jose GOP and independents can reintroduce reason Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is reaching out to voters in the middle who are not necessarily registered with her party. Maybe now is the time for reasonable, responsible Republicans and independents to join together and put forward their goals and program proposals and see if they can join in common cause with mainstream Democrats. Known conservatives, such as Condoleezza Rice and David Brooks, could serve as the starting point for such a coalition. This might have the further benefit of bolstering support for Republican candidates who are in swing districts. The next Congress, convening in 2025, will need more centrists than we have had in recent years. We must do whatever is needed to bring reason and agreement back into our political process. John Cormode Mountain View Attacks on Gus Walz hurt entire community Last Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz accepted the Democratic nomination to be the next vice president. His family’s response was prominently featured, particularly his son Gus’ outpouring of love and pride for his father. Through tears while mouthing “that’s my dad,” Gus showed us all what family love looks like. Unfortunately, in our full-contact political world, some felt it necessary to criticize the beauty of a display we don’t see often, especially related to our political world. His parents understanding this could happen gave an interview in People magazine explaining their son’s conditions. Without this knowledge, I would still be writing this admonishing anyone attacking Gus. With this information, as a behavioral health professional, I would ask everyone in our community to understand what these attacks amount to: an attack on our own families and the decency and goodness of our special-‘power’ kids’ display of love. Go, Gus. David Mineta San Jose Harris must reconsider support for Israel Vice President Harris recently advised Americans to do something when they encounter injustice. In that spirit, I want to draw attention to the ongoing attacks by IDF forces in Gaza and settler violence in the West Bank. These acts of slaughter and starvation against innocent Palestinians are being carried out with weapons funded by billions of our tax dollars. I urge Harris to reconsider her pledge of unconditional support for Israel, which is responsible for these horrific killings and the suffering that makes life a living hell for Palestinians. Republicans are already accusing the administration of monumental hypocrisy, and such accusations will be impossible to defend if this anti-humanitarian policy continues. Jag Singh Los Altos U.S. must change view of ourselves in world After all the fluff and fizz of the DNC convention evaporates, our unwillingness to confront history’s latest genocide remains. What do we do amidst all that giddy self-delusion? We need to concentrate our efforts on showing the obsolete and unworkable nature of that constant refrain, “We are the prime mover and shaker of the world.” That thinking is over 30 years out of date. Our real movers and shakers, if they really love their grandkids, need to transition to our being an “indispensable nation,” not the “undisputed leader.” There is a real difference between the two. The former is reality-based while the latter is nostalgic thinking. Just look at how our corrupt and morally bankrupt position relating to the Gaza genocide is hastening our diminished status in the eyes of the world. Our continuation of this rancid self-adulation is a Shakespearean farce. The RNC has already achieved that much.

Sharing a post on the social media platform Truth, Trump said, \"I have reached an agreement with the Radical Left Democrats for a debate with Comrade Kamala Harris. It will be broadcast live on ABC FAKE NEWS, by far the nastiest and most unfair newscaster in the business, on Tuesday, September 10th, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\" This comes after Trump suggested over the weekend he might cancel the debate amid a feud between the campaigns over the rules. Trump said on Truth Social he and Harris had reached an agreement to follow the same set of rules he and President Joe Biden did during the June 27 CNN debate, including no live audience and muted microphones when the candidates aren't speaking. \"The rules will be the same as the last CNN debate, which seemed to work out well for everyone except, perhaps, Crooked Joe Biden. The debate will be \"stand up,\" and candidates cannot bring notes, or \"cheat sheets.\" We have also been given assurance by ABC that this will be a \"fair and equitable\" debate and that neither side will be given the questions in advance (No Donna Brazile!).\" The Republican presidential candidate further stated that a third debate has not been agreed upon by the Radical Left. The post said, \"Harris would not agree to the FoxNews debate on September 4th, but that date will be held open in case she changes her mind or, Flip Flops, as she has done on every single one of her long-held and cherished policy beliefs. A possible third debate, which would go to NBC FAKE NEWS, has not been agreed to by the Radical Left. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\" Notably, Biden's halting and disjointed performance in his June debate with Trump at CNN ultimately led him to drop out of the presidential race. Harris entered the fray for the presidential ticket after US President Joe Biden announced in July that he was withdrawing from the election bid. If elected president, the 59-year-old Harris would become the first woman in history to become the US president. The vice president is only the second woman ever nominated for the presidency by a major political party.

Yohenry Brito, 24, of Venezuela crossed the border illegally into El Paso, Texas, and was apprehended by border agents May 9, 2023, according to a House Judiciary Committee report on the migrant’s file exclusively obtained by The Post. Days later, on May 17, 2023, the Department of Homeland Security authorized his release into the US on his own recognizance because of a “lack of detention space.” Brito had indicated he needed asylum in the US because he feared returning to Venezuela. Brito went on to be arrested multiple times for a slew of crimes in New York City — including the melee beating of a pair of NYPD officers in Manhattan in January. The suspect is currently being held on bond over the beating and several other of the crimes. DHS was slow to turn over the records on Brito to congressional officials, sitting on them for three months after Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement Chairman Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) first requested them, the committee said. The Judiciary panel called out “President Joe Biden and ‘border czar’ Vice President Kamala Harris” for the release of Brito — and “well over 7 million illegal aliens” — into the US, saying the move unleashed crime across the country. “The results are all too predictable: cities overwhelmed, public services crushed, and communities shattered by the criminality of some illegal aliens,” the Judiciary report states. “Although the Biden-Harris Administration claims that illegal aliens are vetted before being released into the United States, the reality is much more disturbing.” When the 59-year-old Harris was serving as California’s junior senator, she also supported left-wing immigration policy stances — including the decriminalization of illegal border crossings — but has since walked those positions back since replacing Biden, 81, at the top of the 2024 Democratic ticket. When Brito was released from detention on the US border, he was given instructions warning him not to “associate with known gang members, criminal associates, or be associated with any such activity” and not to “commit any crimes.” Soon after, he allegedly helped savagely beat the two cops alongside at least two other migrants tied to the ruthless Tren de Aragua Venezuelan gang. Brito was charged with assault and obstruction and indicted for tampering with physical evidence. He and his six alleged accomplices were released from custody shortly after the violent caught-on-camera incident. Then, after public outcry, he was ordered held on $15,000 cash or $50,000 bond — when it surfaced he had allegedly sparked the attack while having two pending misdemeanor theft cases. Brito was eventually again freed in February when the Rev. Juan Ruiz, the activist minister of Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, put up the $15,000 for his release. “Our church is basically a sanctuary,” Ruiz told The Post at the time. “We assume that people are innocent until they are proven otherwise.” But Brito got caught red-handed two months later for petit larceny after allegedly trying to steal children’s clothing and “fragrances” from Macy’s Herald Square flagship store. Judge Laura Ward said in Manhattan Criminal Court that she was “furious” he was arrested again while out on bail for the NYPD beating case, warning that another slip-up would land him behind bars. “I am very tempted right now to put you in jail. I am telling you right now, if I learn you are rearrested for anything at all between now and this case being finished, I will order a warrant, and I will place bail so high, you will not get out,” she said. “If you jaywalk, if you jump a turnstile, if you do anything at all and I have to issue a warrant, you will not see the light of day until this case is over,” Ward said. It wasn’t long before Brito was accused of more alleged crime — this time for serial theft. He allegedly robbed a Sephora twice, once in July when he cut security wires on display cases to steal perfumes, and again in early August when he ripped off $1,358 worth of merchandise from store shelves before fleeing with an accomplice, who was not arrested, police sources previously told The Post.

Out of the 929 registered voters surveyed between August 23 and 25, 47 percent backed Harris, while 43 percent of respondents said they supported Trump for president. Harris' lead is slightly outside the poll's margin of error of 3.2 percentage points.The vice president held the same lead among likely voters surveyed by PolCom Lab, where 49 percent backed Harris, compared to 45 percent supporting Trump.The results are a significant leap for Harris, who a month ago was trailing Trump by 5 percentage points (49 percent to 44 percent), according to a PolCom Lab survey conducted in the days leading up to Harris entering the 2024 presidential race on July 21. In a separate poll conducted at the end of July, Harris and Trump were locked in a tie among U.S. voters in a head-to-head match-up at 46 percent.Harris has specifically made inroads among self-described independent voters included in PolCom Lab's sampling. While back in July the key voter demographic was fairly split between the two candidates (45 percent Harris and 43 percent Trump), the latest survey shows Harris being backed by 48 percent of independents, while Trump is supported by 35 percent.Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign via email for comment.Tuesday's poll follows Harris' formal nomination at the DNC last week, alongside her running mate and Vice presidential candidate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. It also comes after Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his 2024 campaign and threw his endorsement behind Trump late last week.Kennedy's decision has not appeared to impact the momentum behind Harris' campaign for weeks, however. In a poll released Monday by Angus Reid Global, Harris was found to have a 5-point lead over Trump among registered voters (47 percent to 42 percent.)The vice president held a similar lead in a Morning Consult poll released this week as well, where Harris maintained a four-point lead over Trump (48 percent to 44 percent). That same poll also found that voters' approval rating of Walz jumped after the DNC--in the days following the convention, 42 percent of registered voters said they hold a favorable view of the vice presidential candidate, compared to the 39 percent favorability rating Walz had before the DNC.As of Tuesday, the vice president is leading Trump by 3.5 percentage points on average across national polls, according to FiveThirtyEight.","summary":"The vice president has taken a four-point lead in the latest poll from the Florida Atlantic University Political Communication and Public Opinion Research Lab.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-overtakes-donald-trump-new-poll-1945154","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2459157/harris-overtakes-donald-trump-new-poll.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 22:58:04","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":255063762,"title":"With campaign at full tilt, surprise! Jack Smith strikes again","text":"Smith was apparently in a race against time because the Department of Justice frowns on prosecutors indicting candidates too close to an election, and we are obviously getting close to an election. From the Washington Post: “In about 10 days, a Justice Department policy known as ‘the 60-day rule’ will take effect forestalling any new filing of charges against the former president, who is again the Republican nominee for the White House.” Now, you can look up the “60-day rule” and see that some experts believe the actual number is sort of vague or that it is really a 90-day rule. If that is the case, Smith missed the deadline by a lot. If the number is 60 days, he just made it. And by the way, the old 60- or 90-day rule was based on the fact that there was an actual election day when nearly everyone voted. That is no longer the case; in many states, it’s more like election month. And with early voting starting as early as Sept. 20 in some states, Smith blew up the rule any way you look at it. The new indictment comes 24 days before voting starts in those states. In any event, Smith has without doubt violated an explicit DOJ guideline that says, “Federal prosecutors and agents may never select the timing of any action, including investigative steps, criminal charges, or statements, for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.” By any accounting, Smith has stomped all over that one. How else would one describe an indictment of a presidential candidate that comes after both conventions and two weeks before the candidates’ debate?

SUBSCRIBE NOW: Just $1.00 an issue!Indeed, the public interest in the presidential campaign is so intense — focusing on polls, Vice President Kamala Harris’s positions, her upcoming first interview, the debate, and more — that one could sometimes forget that Trump has multiple criminal indictments still against him. And then there is a looming sentencing Sept. 18 in another criminal case in New York in which he was found guilty of business fraud in a prosecution some experts found entirely without merit. But remember why many Democrats cheered on the elected Democratic prosecutors in New York and Georgia, and the prosecutor appointed by Democrats in Washington, D.C., who pursued the lawfare charges against Trump. With Trump running away with the Republican nomination, and with President Joe Biden’s age and infirmity depressing Democratic enthusiasm and support for his reelection bid, the future looked grim for the party’s prospects in the 2024 presidential race. At times, the only bright spot was the lawfare campaign, which many Democrats hoped would cripple Trump if all else failed. In her still-young campaign, Harris has made Trump’s criminal charges, plus a couple of lawsuits against him in New York, a central moment of her stump speech. For example, at a rally in Wisconsin, Harris said that as a prosecutor, “I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type.” (Harris was referring to the E. Jean Carroll suit and then the New York lawsuit against Trump, as well as the New York indictment.) Harris is certain to bring up the Trump prosecutions when the two meet in their Sept. 10 debate — and again and again after that, all the way until Election Day. After all, what was the lawfare campaign all about? This new indictment keeps interest fresh. Reacting to the charges, Trump focused on the election angle. “This is merely an attempt to INTERFERE WITH THE ELECTION, and distract the American people from the catastrophe Kamala Harris has inflicted on our nation, like the border invasion, migrant crime, rampant inflation, the threat of World War III, and more,” Trump posted on Truth Social. Of course, Democrats will deny that the new indictment has anything to do with the election, but look around. Look at the news coverage. Look at the calendar. The Trump prosecutions are a huge part of the election, and many Democrats wouldn’t have it any other way.","summary":"WITH CAMPAIGN AT FULL TILT, SURPRISE!

A source with knowledge of the incident said the cemetery official tried to prevent Trump staffers from filming and photographing in a section where recent U.S. casualties are buried. The source said Arlington officials had made clear that only cemetery staff members are authorized to take photographs or film in the area, known as Section 60. When the cemetery official tried to prevent Trump campaign staff from entering Section 60, campaign staff verbally abused and pushed the official aside, according to the source. Trump participated in an event to mark the third anniversary of a deadly attack on U.S. troops in Afghanistan as U.S. forces withdrew from the country; 13 U.S. service members were killed in the attack. The Trump campaign has blamed President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, now the Democratic presidential nominee, for the chaotic withdrawal. In a statement to NPR, Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign spokesman, strongly rejected the notion of a physical altercation, adding: \"We are prepared to release footage if such defamatory claims are made. \"The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony,\" Cheung said in the statement. The Trump campaign declined to make that footage immediately available. In a statement to NPR, Arlington National Cemetery said it \"can confirm there was an incident, and a report was filed.\" “Federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries, to include photographers, content creators or any other persons attending for purposes, or in direct support of a partisan political candidate’s campaign,\" according to the statement. \"Arlington National Cemetery reinforced and widely shared this law and its prohibitions with all participants.\"","summary":"The cemetery official tried to prevent Trump staffers from filming and photographing in a section where recent U.S. casualties are buried, a source with knowledge of the event told NPR.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/27/nx-s1-5091154/trump-arlington-cemetery","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1024x683!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa5%2F27%2F4f1bf65d4e0a999565326c690e8d%2Fgettyimages-2168623932.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 22:55:03","author":"Quil Lawrence","authors":["Quil Lawrence"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":255063082,"title":"The Last-Minute Curveball for a Big FTC Ban","text":"In the early days of 2023, the Federal Trade Commission made a big announcement: It was proposing a new rule banning noncompete agreements for almost all American workers. The proposed ban was set to take effect next week, but a federal judge in Texas ruled to block it last week. An FTC spokesperson told me in an email that the agency was “seriously considering” appealing the Texas judge’s ruling. Even if the agency doesn’t salvage its own ban, though, a surprisingly diverse group of lawmakers seem poised to try to take these agreements down. The idea of a noncompete agreement first emerged in the 1400s, Evan Starr, a professor at the University of Maryland’s business school, told me, when a master craftsman tried to prevent his well-trained apprentice from practicing his trade elsewhere. Today, companies that use noncompetes argue that they are valuable as a way to keep employees from poaching their client lists, to make sure that their investments in training employees don’t wind up benefiting other businesses, and to protect trade secrets. About a third of American companies now include noncompete terms in every employee contract, Starr noted, and an estimated 20 percent of the American workforce is subject to noncompete agreements. Some are top business executives whose bosses don’t want to see them jump ship to a competitor. But others are lower-wage employees in a variety of roles for which the case for a noncompete isn’t always as compelling: dancers, camp counselors, house cleaners, many of whom are trying to move to higher-paying jobs or start their own business. In an infamous example, Jimmy John’s employees once faced temporary restrictions from working at nearby sandwich-making businesses (the company dropped noncompetes in 2016 after settling a lawsuit on the matter). Noncompetes are not always technically enforceable, but they can still be very expensive to fight in court, and lead some employees to avoid seeking jobs with better wages or conditions for fear of violating a contract. A wealth of research has established that being free from noncompetes leads to higher wages and better mobility for workers (the FTC estimates that a typical worker would make $524 more a year if noncompetes were banned). But framing noncompetes solely as a labor issue misses the point, Orly Lobel, a law professor at UC San Diego, told me: “Beyond the protection of workers, it’s about harm to the economy and the market.” Employers benefit, she argued, from a less rigid economy, where new entrants have a chance to compete. The explosion of entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley—located in a state in which noncompetes are largely banned—played a big role in getting government officials to look more seriously at banning noncompetes, Lobel said. By the time President Barack Obama took office, he was calling on states to ban the agreements for some workers, arguing that it would boost wages and foster competition. The Biden administration kept pushing on the issue, and Vice President Kamala Harris has called the FTC’s attempted ban “a huge win.” The FTC “may not have been the right vehicle” for banning noncompetes, Starr said, because its authority to do so was not clear—the Texas judge argued as much when she blocked it. Several business groups have sued the FTC over the ban, and the agency may face pushback in higher courts if it appeals the Texas decision. As William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University and a former FTC commissioner told me in an email, the FTC is currently seeking “expansive interpretation of its authority” at the same time that federal courts, including the Supreme Court, are demanding that agencies show they have the backing of Congress before using broad regulatory power. But the FTC’s move wasn’t the only recent effort to quash the noncompete. Last year, employees at another federal agency, the National Labor Relations Board, received a memo from its general counsel determining that such agreements violate the National Labor Relations Act (the law that protects employees’ right to collective bargaining) in most circumstances. A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a bill last February that would narrow the use of noncompetes; Senator Marco Rubio has also advocated for a version of a noncompete ban for low-wage workers. The FTC proposal has helped inspire states to rethink their own restrictions on noncompetes, too, experts told me. As both a labor and a free-market issue, noncompetes bring unlikely groups of allies together. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Matt Gaetz, for example, both came out as strong supporters of the FTC ban. This range of support suggests that the battle against noncompetes is far from over.

Sharing a post on the social media platform Truth, Trump said, \"I have reached an agreement with the Radical Left Democrats for a debate with Comrade Kamala Harris. It will be broadcast live on ABC FAKE NEWS, by far the nastiest and most unfair newscaster in the business, on Tuesday, September 10th, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\" This comes after Trump suggested over the weekend he might cancel the debate amid a feud between the campaigns over the rules. Trump said on Truth Social he and Harris had reached an agreement to follow the same set of rules he and President Joe Biden did during the June 27 CNN debate, including no live audience and muted microphones when the candidates aren't speaking. \"The rules will be the same as the last CNN debate, which seemed to work out well for everyone except, perhaps, Crooked Joe Biden. The debate will be \"stand up,\" and candidates cannot bring notes, or \"cheat sheets.\" We have also been given assurance by ABC that this will be a \"fair and equitable\" debate and that neither side will be given the questions in advance (No Donna Brazile!).\" The Republican presidential candidate further stated that a third debate has not been agreed upon by the Radical Left. The post said, \"Harris would not agree to the FoxNews debate on September 4th, but that date will be held open in case she changes her mind or, Flip Flops, as she has done on every single one of her long-held and cherished policy beliefs. A possible third debate, which would go to NBC FAKE NEWS, has not been agreed to by the Radical Left. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\" Notably, Biden's halting and disjointed performance in his June debate with Trump at CNN ultimately led him to drop out of the presidential race. Harris entered the fray for the presidential ticket after US President Joe Biden announced in July that he was withdrawing from the election bid. If elected president, the 59-year-old Harris would become the first woman in history to become the US president.

Here’s what to know about the claims. Zuckerberg alleges government pressure in letter to Judiciary Committee Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg answers a question during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Jan. 31, 2024. In the letter, addressed to House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Zuckerberg acknowledged that there is “a lot of talk right now” about how the U.S. government interacts with media companies like Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook. The letter, sent Monday, is the latest in the committee’s investigation into how tech companies work with the federal government and make content moderation decisions. Zuckerberg said Meta has produced “thousands of documents” for the committee’s investigation and will make employees available to interview. To further aid the investigation, the tech mogul said he was writing the letter to “share what I’ve taken away from this process.” The letter was shared on the House Judiciary Committee GOP’s Facebook page, where they said it was a “big win for free speech.” “Mark Zuckerberg just admitted three things: 1. Biden-Harris Admin ‘pressured’ Facebook to censor Americans. 2. Facebook censored Americans. 3. Facebook throttled the Hunter Biden laptop story,” the panel wrote.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Zuckerberg claimed senior Biden administration officials pushed Meta to censor certain content related to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. “In 2021, senior officials from the Biden Administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, and expressed a lot of frustration with our teams when we didn’t agree,” he wrote. Zuckerberg said he believes the government pressure was “wrong” and that the company was not “more outspoken” on the issue at the time. He added that Meta made decisions that they would not make today with “the benefit of hindsight and new information.” He added later in the letter: “We’re ready to push back if something like this happens again.” Meta demoted Biden family article over Russian disinformation fears Meta’s logo is seen on a sign, Nov. 9, 2022, at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. Vásquez, File) Zuckerberg said the FBI warned Meta about a “potential Russian disinformation operation” in the lead up to the 2020 presidential election between [President Joe] Biden and former President [Donald] Trump. He noted in the letter that the potential operation was about the Biden family and its ties to Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company linked to the president’s son Hunter Biden. The company made the decision to demote an article from the New York Post about corruption allegations against Biden, who, at the time, was the Democratic presidential nominee. “We sent that story to fact-checkers for review and temporarily demoted it while waiting for a reply,” Zuckerberg said. “It’s since been made clear that the reporting was not Russian disinformation, and in retrospect, we shouldn’t have demoted the story.” Meta has updated its policies and procedures, including no longer temporarily demoting posts in the U.S. while waiting for fact-checkers, he added. CEO acknowledges contributions to ‘last presidential cycle’ This photo shows the mobile phone app logos for, from left, Facebook and Instagram in New York, Oct. 5, 2021. (Stock) In the final paragraph of his two-page letter, Zuckerberg said he wanted to address the “contributions I made during the last presidential cycle to support electoral infrastructure.” While the contributions were intended to be “non-partisan,” per the Meta founder, they have been accused of being unfairly distributed among left and right-leaning areas, which Republicans labeled “Zuckerbucks.” Zuckerberg said the “Chan Zuckerberg Initiative” was intended to be distributed across urban, rural and suburban communities. He said despite seeing analyses showing otherwise, “I know that some people believe this work benefitted one party over the other.” “My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another — or to even appear to be playing a role,” he concluded. “So I don’t plan on making a similar contribution this cycle.” Trump responds claiming 2020 election was rigged Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks at the National Guard Association of the United States’ 146th General Conference, Monday, Aug. 26, 2024, in Detroit.

The former president was responding to a post from his lawyer, Alina Habba, which targeted the Biden administration and Trump’s new Democratic rival in the election, Vice President Kamala Harris. “This is exactly what this administration (WHICH INCLUDES KAMALA) has done to our country,” Habba wrote. “Censorship is what happens in communist countries not this republic.” The White House defended its actions in a statement to The Hill. “When confronted with a deadly pandemic, this Administration encouraged responsible actions to protect public health and safety,” a spokesperson wrote in the statement. “Our position has been clear and consistent: we believe tech companies and other private actors should take into account the effects their actions have on the American people, while making independent choices about the information they present.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n(The Hill) &#8212; Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote a letter to the House&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Key takeaways from Zuckerberg&#8217;s claim of Biden administration influence on Meta content moderation first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/key-takeaways-from-zuckerbergs-claim-of-biden-administration-influence-on-meta-content-moderation/","image":"https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/zuckerbergmark4_013124gn.jpeg?w=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 22:46:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":255064516,"title":"Harris set to give first interview since launching presidential bid","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris is sitting down with CNN this week for her first interview since President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid.
