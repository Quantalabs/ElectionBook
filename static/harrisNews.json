Grande, 32, reshared “A Bit Fruity” podcast host Matt Bernstein’s Instagram post on Sunday, which criticised voters who cast their ballots for Trump instead of former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. “Save your tears, Ariana. Because President Trump’s actions ended Joe Biden’s inflation crisis and are bringing in trillions in new investments,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement, quoting the title of the ‘Wicked’ star’s remix with The Weeknd, according to the New York Post. Desai continued, “He even signed an executive order just like magic that paved the way for the FTC to crack down on Ticketmaster for ripping off Ariana Grande’s concert-going fans. Get well soon, Ariana!”Grande's repost questioned the impact of Trump's presidency on various aspects of life. The original post read: “I want to check in with Trump voters. I have one very genuine question: it’s been 250 days. Now that immigrants have been violently torn from their families and communities have been destroyed, now that trans people have been blamed for virtually everything and live in fear, now that free speech is on the brink of collapse for us all — has your life gotten better?” “Have your groceries gotten cheaper? Has your health insurance premium gone down? Has your work/life balance improved? Can you take a vacation yet? Are you happier? Has the widespread suffering of others paid off for you in the way he promised it would, or are you still waiting?” Grande publicly supported Harris, 60, over Trump in the election last year.","summary":"The White House issued a fiery clapback to singer Ariana Grande after she reposted an anti-Trump message criticizing his 2024 voters.

Gavin Newsom, who is termed out.\n\nAtkins, a former San Diego City Council woman, acting mayor, assemblywoman, Speaker of the Assembly and President pro tempore of the California State Senate, announced her gubernatorial candidacy in January 2024.\n\nIn announcing her withdrawal from the governor’s race, she said she will continue to fight against the politics of President Donald Trump.\n\n“My intention was to build on that progress, to bring real solutions from day one, and to do good work for the people. That’s why it’s with such a heavy heart that I’m stepping aside today as a candidate for governor,” Atkins wrote in a letter to supporters. “Despite the strong support we’ve received and all we’ve achieved, there is simply no viable path forward to victory. Though my campaign is ending, I will keep fighting for California’s future.\n\n“With Donald Trump and his allies threatening everything we’ve worked for — gutting health care, cratering our economy, and stripping away fundamental rights and freedoms — we’ve got to make sure California has a Democratic governor leading the fight, and that means uniting as Democrats.”\n\nIn August 2023, Atkins announced she would step down as Senate president pro tem — planned for early next month. She is the first person in more than 150 years to have held both that job and the position of Speaker of the California State Assembly — which she held from 2014-2016 before being elected to the Senate.\n\nAtkins grew up in rural Appalachian Virginia and moved to California in 1985.\n\nShe was elected to the San Diego City Council in 2000 and was acting mayor for six months in 2005 following the resignation of Dick Murphy. She has also filled in for the governor temporarily when he was out of state. Atkins was elected to the Assembly in 2010 and became Majority Leader less than two years later. She is termed out from running for the Senate again.\n\nAccording to an August poll by Emerson College, Atkins was polling at around 2%, while former Rep. Katie Porter led all Democrats in a crowded field at 18% — up from 12% in a similar poll in April. Republican Steve Hilton led candidates from the other side of the aisle with 12% in the poll.\n\n“With Kamala Harris officially out of the race, Katie Porter has emerged as the Democratic frontrunner, increasing her support from 12% to 18% since the April Emerson poll,” said Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling. “Steve Hilton, who was not in the race in April, has jumped to 12%, while the share of undecided voters has dropped from 54% to 38% over the summer. Porter leads among voters over 50 (22%), those with a postgraduate degree (35%), and white voters (23%).”","summary":"Longtime San Diego legislator Toni Atkins announced Monday she was bowing out of the 2026 race to replace Gov.

The settlement marks YouTube, owned by Alphabet’s Google, as the final major tech company to resolve one of the trio of lawsuits Trump brought against social media platforms after leaving the White House. Settlement Details and Distribution According to WSJ, Google aimed to keep its payout smaller than the $25 million settlement paid by Meta Platforms earlier this year. Of YouTube’s $24.5 million settlement, approximately $22 million will go to the nonprofit Trust for the National Mall, earmarked for the construction of a Mar-a-Lago-style ballroom Trump is planning at the White House. The White House has indicated the $200 million ballroom will be funded by Trump and other private donors. The remaining $2.5 million will be distributed among other plaintiffs in the case, including the American Conservative Union and writer Naomi Wolf. The settlement documents do not specify attorney fees. Context and Broader Impact This settlement completes Trump’s legal victories over Big Tech companies stemming from his lawsuits filed after the 2020 presidential election. Meta settled in January for $25 million, most of which was directed toward a fund for Trump’s presidential library, while X (formerly Twitter) agreed to pay $10 million, much of which reportedly went directly to Trump. Since winning last fall’s election, Trump has accumulated over $80 million in settlements from lawsuits against Big Tech and media companies. For instance, Paramount Global recently settled for $16 million over a lawsuit Trump filed concerning a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump’s cases against the social media giants were filed four years ago by attorneys John P. Coale and John Q. Kelly. Coale credited Trump’s recent election victory as a pivotal factor in pushing the companies toward settlement, stating, “If he had not been re-elected, we would have been in court for 1,000 years. It was his re-election that made the difference.” Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News and around the World.","summary":"YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump over his account suspension after the January 6 Capitol riot.

Netanyahu, 75, has seldom been personally popular—recent polls suggest only 40% of Israelis trust him—but long ago established himself as “Mr. Security,” the man best placed to protect Israel from its enemies, notably Iran and its allies Hezbollah and the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. To his critics inside Israel, “King Bibi” is a ruthless and corrupt danger to democracy who prioritizes his own interests over Israel’s. The right-wing leader is, nevertheless, the most influential figure in Israeli politics today, and arguably the entire Middle East. Both friends and foes describe Netanyahu as the ultimate political survivor, one who is motivated by both an overwhelming sense of his own importance—“Without Bibi the country is lost,” his wife, Sara, often says—and a deep pessimism. “I’m asked if we will forever live by the sword: Yes,” he told Israeli lawmakers in 2015.\n\nWhat shaped his worldview?\nHis father, in large part. Bibi was born in Tel Aviv in 1949, the middle son of Benzion Netanyahu, a Polish-born medieval historian—“Jewish history is in large measure a history of holocausts,” he once said—who believed in a Greater Israel that would encompass modern-day Jordan. Netanyahu’s teenage years were spent between Israel and the U.S., where his father taught; at 18, in 1967, he returned to Israel for military service. During five distinguished years in the army, he fought in Lebanon and served in the Israeli special forces alongside his brothers Iddo and Yoni, the latter of whom was especially close to Bibi. In 1976, while Netanyahu was studying at MIT, Yoni was killed during a special forces raid to free Israeli hostages held by Palestinian and German terrorists at Uganda’s Entebbe International Airport. In death, Yoni became a national hero and inspired his brother’s political career.\nIn what way?\nNetanyahu said his brother saw himself engaged in a “struggle between civilization and barbarism.” In the wake of Yoni’s death, “[I] devoted myself to this battle.” The Netanyahus founded an Israeli anti-terrorism institute in Yoni’s memory; Bibi headed the organization, which gave him the connections to enter politics. Appointed Israel’s representative to the U.N. in 1984, he became a regular presence on U.S. cable news, defending Israel’s policies with skill and charm. Elected to the Knesset in 1988, Netanyahu was named head of the right-wing Likud party in 1993 and three years later became prime minister after defeating Shimon Peres’ Labor by less than 1 percentage point. His first term was troubled. He infuriated right-wingers by ceding chunks of the West Bank to Palestinian Authority control, while accusations of corruption damaged him with centrists. He lost the 1999 election.\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

In 2009, he was elected prime minister again, capitalizing on a rightward shift in Israel fueled partly by Hamas’ takeover of Gaza and fear of Iran’s nuclear ambitions. In office, he nurtured Israel’s high-tech economy, forged anti-Iran alliances with Arab monarchies, and gained notoriety for trying to consolidate power. His attempts at media manipulation, allegedly offering deals in return for favorable coverage, embroiled him in two criminal cases; his proposed “judicial reform” law would allow for greater political influence over the judiciary. On the Palestinian issue, Netanyahu has worked to undermine a two-state solution. His governments, which have included far-right parties since 2022, have let Israeli settlers build on West Bank land designated as Palestinian by the U.N. And until the massacre of Oct. 7, 2023, Netanyahu let Qatar send millions of dollars a month to Gaza, believing a strong Hamas would serve as a counterweight to the West Bank–based Palestinian Authority.\n\nHow did Oct. 7 affect him?\nThe attack by Hamas, in which nearly 1,200 Israelis were killed and 251 taken hostage, was the result of serious intelligence failings, and initially dealt a crushing blow to Netanyahu’s reputation. His relentless prosecution of the war in Gaza since—in which more than 65,000 people have died, according to Palestinian authorities—has weakened Israel’s alliances with many Western nations and bitterly divided Israelis, though the campaign still enjoys significant support in the country. Critics allege he has kept the war going to appease far-right members of his coalition, delay a reckoning over his security failures, and reduce the possibility of his being tried on corruption charges. “My Matan is being sacrificed on Netanyahu’s altar,” Einav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan Zangauker, said earlier this month.\nWhy is Netanyahu still in power?\nBecause the war’s continuation has let him play to his strengths as Mr. Security. Under Netanyahu’s leadership since Oct. 7, Israel has not merely destroyed Hamas as a military force but also decapitated its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, and inflicted major damage on Iran’s military capabilities and nuclear program, with U.S. assistance, in its 12-day war with the Islamic Republic. While Israel’s regional enemies are weaker, Netanyahu warned last week that growing international condemnation could force Israel to become a “super Sparta” with “autarkic features,” meaning little engagement with international trade—presumably with himself in charge. “He thinks he’s the one who can save Israel from the imminent threat of annihilation,” said Aviv Bushinsky, who worked as an aide to Netanyahu for nine years. “He really believes that he is the only one on Earth that can do it.”\nDealing with Washington\n“Who the f--- does he think he is? Who’s the f---ing superpower here?” These were reportedly Bill Clinton’s words after his first meeting with Netanyahu, in 1996. The Israeli prime minister knows the U.S. and its media well, and—buoyed by pro-Israel lobby groups and support from the Christian Right—he has felt confident to push back against Democratic presidents who have sought to rein in Israel. Barack Obama’s officials described him as “untrustworthy.” In 2015, Netanyahu accepted a Republican invitation to address Congress and railed against the nuclear deal Obama was brokering with Iran. Bibi had better relations with President Joe Biden, especially after Oct. 7. But by the time Biden left office, he was privately referring to Netanyahu as an “asshole.” President Trump has given Netanyahu free rein to wage war in Gaza and attack Israel’s enemies across the Middle East. But there are signs that, like his predecessors, Trump is losing patience with Bibi. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that, after Israel’s strike on Hamas leaders in U.S.-allied Qatar, Trump told aides, “He’s f---ing me.”\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nExplore More\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu\n\nThe Week US\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nTrump promotes an unproven Tylenol-autism link\n\nTrump gave baseless advice to pregnant women, claiming Tylenol causes autism in children\n\nTrump: Demanding the prosecution of his political foes\n\nTrump orders Pam Bondi to ‘act fast’ and prosecute James Comey, Letitia James, and Adam Schiff\n\nRussia is ‘helping China’ prepare for an invasion of Taiwan\n\nIn the Spotlight\nRussia is reportedly allowing China access to military training\n\nYou might also like\n\nTrump promotes an unproven Tylenol-autism link\n\nTrump gave baseless advice to pregnant women, claiming Tylenol causes autism in children\n\nTrump: Demanding the prosecution of his political foes\n\nTrump orders Pam Bondi to ‘act fast’ and prosecute James Comey, Letitia James, and Adam Schiff\n\nShould Tony Blair run Gaza?\n\nToday's Big Question\nFormer PM is a key figure in plans for a post-war Palestine and could take up a formal leadership position\n\n‘Making a political donation shouldn’t be this dangerous’\n\nInstant Opinion\nOpinion, comment and editorials of the day\n\nUkraine: Trump’s latest stalling tactic\n\nTrump plans to impose sanctions on Russia only if all 31 NATO states join in and agree to ban Russian oil imports\n\nCancel culture: Now coming from the Right\n\nConservatives are encouraging the firing of hundreds of Americans over their negative opinions on Charlie Kirk\n\nCrackdown: Trump’s new blue city targets\n\nTrump has vowed to deploy the National Guard, FBI, and ICE to Memphis, naming St. Louis and New Orleans as his next targets\n\nDemocrats: Harris and Biden’s blame game\n\nKamala Harris’ new memoir reveals frustrations over Biden’s reelection bid and her time as vice president\n\nView More ▸\n\nContact Future's experts\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookie Policy\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nThe Week is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

It also raises fresh questions about how much space there will be for his trademark symbolism and social commentary — including his past criticism of President Donald Trump — given the NFL's history of keeping performances tightly managed.\n\nHere are some things to know about the selection.\n\nHow the show comes together\n\nThe halftime show is a collaboration between the NFL, Roc Nation and Apple Music.\n\nRoc Nation, Jay-Z’s entertainment company, has curated performers since 2019 and returns alongside veteran producer Jesse Collins. Apple Music distributes the performance, while the NFL ultimately controls the stage, broadcast and branding.\n\nArtists don’t get a paycheck for performing. However, their payoff is global exposure. That imbalance gives the league leverage, though history shows that high-powered stars sometimes defy the league’s guardrails.\n\nA stage with boundaries\n\nThe NFL has a track record of pushing back when artists get political. However, some performers don't always comply.\n\n• In 2020, the league asked Jennifer Lopez to cut a segment featuring children in cages, a critique of U.S. immigration policies. She refused.\n\n• In 2022, it was reported that Dr. Dre and Eminem were both advised not to kneel or reference police, but they went forward.\n\n• Rapper M.I.A. flashed a middle finger during Madonna’s set, earning a hefty fine in 2012. She and the NFL ultimately reached a settlement ending their multimillion dollar dispute a couple years later.\n\nWhy Bad Bunny matters\n\nWhile Bad Bunny is a known hitmaker, he’s also an artist who ties his music to Puerto Rican identity, colonial politics and immigrant struggles. His Super Bowl announcement included a pointed dedication: “This is for my people, my culture, and our history.”\n\nThat alone sets the stage for a performance that could carry layered meanings far beyond spectacle.\n\nIn his career, Bad Bunny has become one of the world’s most streamed artists with albums such as “Un Verano Sin Ti,” an all-Spanish-language record.\n\nThe 31-year-old artist born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio has won three Grammys and 12 Latin Grammys. He has become a global ambassador for Latin music, starred in films such as “Bullet Train,” “Caught Stealing” and “Happy Gilmore 2,” and collaborated with top fashion houses. He enters November's Latin Grammys as the leading nominee with 12, dethroning producer and songwriter Édgar Barrera.\n\nBad Bunny v. Trump\n\nBad Bunny has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. In the final weeks of the 2024 campaign, he backed former Vice President Kamala Harris after a comedian at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally mocked Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.”\n\nDays later, Bad Bunny posted a video showcasing Puerto Rico’s beaches and artists, captioned simply: “garbage.”\n\nSince Trump took office, Bad Bunny's criticism hasn’t slowed. This year, he shared an Instagram video appearing to show immigration agents making arrests in Puerto Rico, with the voice behind the camera cursing the agents.\n\nOn July 4, he released the video for “NUEVAYoL”, featuring a Trump-like voice apologizing to immigrants: “This country is nothing without the immigrants.”\n\nBad Bunny also shifted his touring strategy. The first nine nights of his 31-show Puerto Rico residency were reserved for island residents, and he skipped U.S. tour stops.\n\n“There was the issue of—like, (expletive) ICE could be outside,” he told i-D magazine. He’s since taken his tour to Latin America, Europe, Asia and Australia.\n\nBut on Sunday, before Bad Bunny made the Super Bowl announcement, he said: “I've been thinking about it these days, and after discussing it with my team, I think I'll do just one date in the United States.”\n\nA divided reaction\n\nThe halftime announcement has already drawn split responses. California Gov. Gavin Newsom cheered the booking, writing on X: “California is excited to welcome you to Super Bowl LX.”\n\nSome Make America Great Again-aligned influencers were quick to push back.\n\nRyan Fournier, chair of Students for Trump, said “whoever picks these people should be fired.”\n\nConservative podcaster Benny Johnson called Bad Bunny a “massive Trump hater” and “anti-ICE activist,” and criticized that he doesn't have songs in English.\n\nBad Bunny has long shrugged off such critiques. Asked by The New York Times earlier this year how he felt about fans who don’t understand his lyrics, he sang into the microphone: “I don’t care.”\n\nTrump's attention on sports and culture\n\nTrump has a long history of inserting politics into sports. He’s pushed for the late Pete Rose’s Hall of Fame induction, threatened to block Washington’s new stadium deal if the team didn’t restore its old name, and frequently used sporting events as political platforms.\n\nThe moves are part of his broader efforts to shape the country’s cultural mood, weighing in on entertainers and companies alike. He blasted late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, whose show briefly faced suspension after the Trump administration signaled potential repercussions following remarks in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s assassination.\n\nHe also revived his long-running feud with Rosie O’Donnell, saying earlier this year that he was considering “taking away” her U.S. citizenship after she criticized his proposed spending cuts.\n\nAnd just last month, Trump inserted himself into the backlash over Cracker Barrel’s new logo, posting on Truth Social that the company should stick with its old design. When the chain reversed course, he celebrated the decision as a personal victory.\n\nWhat’s at stake\n\nFor Bad Bunny, the halftime show is the ultimate stage to showcase his music, heritage and global influence. For the NFL and Apple Music, it’s a balancing act: deliver a spectacle that celebrates diversity without igniting controversy that scares off advertisers.\n\nIf Bad Bunny leans strictly into spectacle, the moment could be historic for Latin music. If he threads in political symbolism, it could become one of the most dissected halftime performances in Super Bowl history.","summary":"The selection of Bad Bunny to headline the Super Bowl halftime show is about more than music.

Gavin Newsom. Atkins told supporters in a letter Monday afternoon that during a childhood in rural Virginia, she often felt \"too country, too poor, too gay\" to fit in. After building a life on the West Coast, where she found acceptance and opportunity, she worked for decades to build on \"the promise of California\" and extend it to future generations, she said. \"That’s why it's with such a heavy heart that I'm stepping aside today as a candidate for governor,\" Atkins wrote. \"Despite the strong support we’ve received and all we've achieved, there is simply no viable path forward to victory.\" Atkins began her political career on the San Diego City Council after serving as a women's clinic administrator. She became the first out LGBTQ+ person to serve as Senate president pro tem, the top position in the California Senate. She was also the speaker of the state Assembly, making her the first legislator since 1871 to hold both leadership posts. In Sacramento, Atkins was a champion for affordable housing and reproductive rights, including writing the legislation that became Proposition 1 in 2022, codifying abortion rights in the California Constitution after national protections were undone by the U.S. Supreme Court. With President Trump and his allies \"gutting health care, cratering our economy, and stripping away fundamental rights and freedoms,\" Atkins told supporters Monday, \"we've got to make sure California has a Democratic governor leading the fight, and that means uniting as Democrats.\" Under California's nonpartisan primary system, the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, advance to the general election. Votes on the left could be fractured among a half-dozen Democratic candidates, creating a more viable path forward for one of the two high-profile Republicans in the race to make it to the November ballot. Atkins picked up millions of dollars in donations after entering the governor's race in January 2024, and reported having $4.3 million on hand — more than most candidates — at the end of the first half of the year. More recent reports from major donations suggest her fundraising had lagged behind former Orange County-based U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former state Atty. Gen. and Biden appointee Xavier Becerra. Although well-known in political circles, Atkins is not a household name. Recent polls, including one conducted by UC Berkeley and co-sponsored by The Times, showed her support in the single digits. Nine months before the primary, the field of candidates is still in flux, and many voters are undecided. At the end of July, former Vice President Kamala Harris made the biggest news of the campaign when she said she would not run. Shortly afterward, her political ally Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis abandoned her gubernatorial bid and announced she would run for state treasurer. Some polling has shown that Porter, who left Congress after losing a bid for a rare open seat in the U.S. Senate, is the candidate to beat. Last week, lobbyist and former state legislative leader Ian Calderon, 39, launched his campaign for governor, calling it the advent of a \"new generation of leadership.\" Calderon, 39, was the first millennial elected to the state Assembly and the youngest-ever majority leader of the state Assembly. He is part of a political dynasty from southeastern Los Angeles County that's held power in Sacramento for decades. His family's name was clouded during his time in Sacramento when two of his uncles served prison time in connection with a bribery scheme, but Calderon was not accused of wrongdoing.","summary":"San Diego Democrat and former state Senate leader Toni Atkins dropped out of the 2026 California governor's race Monday, part of a contraction of the wide field of candidates vying to replace Gov.

John Fetterman, D-Pa., is distancing himself from the name-calling rhetoric associated with America’s enemies during World War II.\n\n“If you want a Democrat that’s going to call people Nazis or fascists or all these kinds of thing, well, I’m not going to be that guy,” the Pennsylvania senator told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo in a Sunday interview. \n\nFetterman also expressed that becoming a Republican was still off the table.\n\n“No, I’m not going to switch, but I’m just going to be an independent voice in the Democratic Party,” Fetterman told Bartiromo. \n\nThe Sunday comments come after Fetterman also urged on X a lowering of the political temperature.\n\n“Unchecked extreme rhetoric, like labels as Hitler or fascist, will foment more extreme outcomes. Political violence is always wrong—no exceptions. We must all turn the temperature down,” Fetterman wrote.\n\nHis statement on the social media platform also referenced an Axios report on a new study, which found that 2025 marked “the first time in more than 30 years that left-wing attacks outnumber those from the far right” in the United States. \n\nOver the past several years, rhetoric about President Donald Trump by his Democrat opponents would sometimes veer into allegations that he was a danger to democracy.\n\nFor example, in a speech given in July 2016, then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said, “This man [Trump] is the nominee of the party of Lincoln. We are watching it become the party of Trump, and that’s not just a huge loss for our democracy, it is a threat to it.” \n\n“We saved democracy in 2020, and now we must save it again in 2024,” then-President Joe Biden said at the Democratic National Convention last year. \n\nBiden’s former presidential campaign also did not shy away from comparing Trump’s speech to the infamous leaders of two of the Axis Powers. \n\n“He’s [Trump] going to echo the rhetoric of Hitler and Mussolini, and we’re going to make sure that people understand just how serious that is every single time,” the communications director for the Biden campaign argued in December 2023. \n\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, then-Vice President Kamala Harris explicitly told Anderson Cooper during a CNN town hall she thought Trump was a fascist.\n\nThe World War II referencing rhetoric has also been employed by members of Congress. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, has described Trump as a “Temu Hitler” that “thinks that he is going to become the dictator of the United States.” Temu is an online shopping marketplace for discounted goods. \n\n“Donald Trump is America’s Hitler,” Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said at a political protest in June. \n\nRecently, California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s press office extended the name-calling to a member of Trump’s inner circle, posting on X, “STEPHEN MILLER IS A FASCIST!” referring to the White House deputy chief of staff.\n\nThe move to brand Miller with the term comes after the phrase “Hey, fascist! Catch!” was found on a bullet casing tied to the alleged shooter of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. \n\nFetterman’s comments on Sunday are not the first time he has sought to combat violence tied to political causes. He previously criticized the Los Angeles riots in June that broke out over the enforcement of immigration law by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \n\n“My party loses the moral high ground when we refuse to condemn setting cars on fire, destroying buildings, and assaulting law enforcement,” Fetterman noted on X at the time. \n\nThe Pennsylvania Democrat also reiterated in his Sunday interview with Bartiromo his support for the state of Israel. \n\n“And this truth right now, it’s firmly on Israel through this. And it’s also always wrong to shut our government down,” Fetterman said. “And that’s where my voice is, and if that puts me as an outlier, that’s where I am.”","summary":"Sen.

Get well soon, Ariana!'\n\nAriana Grande has drawn the ire of Donald Trump's White House after sharing a rare political statement with her 523 million Instagram followers; seen in November 2024\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to Grande's representatives but have not heard back. \nGrande has openly backed progressive candidates in the past, voting for Kamala Harris in 2024 and Bernie Sanders in 2020. \n\n Ariana Grande hits out at Trump supporters in scathing social media post \nShe has also been vocal about LGBTQIA+ rights, Palestinian rights, reproductive rights, and voter registration.\nReactions to her latest post were split. \nMany fans applauded the singer for speaking out, with one writing on X: 'Girl, MAGA will go bankrupt trying to buy groceries as long as it means they deported Jorge from Home Depot trying to feed his kids.' \nAnother supporter added: 'I love this woman with every fiber in me!'\nOthers criticized her involvement in politics.\nSome accused her of hypocrisy, pointing back to her 2015 donut-licking scandal, when she was caught on camera saying, 'I hate Americans. I hate America.'\n\nOn Sunday, the star reposted a message from podcaster Matt Bernstein that slammed Trump's second term and asked his supporters to reflect on whether their lives had truly improved\nOne user wrote: 'Isn't she the same person who said she hates America while sneaking a lick on a donut in a shop, causing the health dept to reprimand a small business? I happened to be in that area and spoke to the owner right after. She almost ruined that business.'\nGrande's political comments also come three months after she reposted a tweet from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling for Trump's third impeachment following what she described as his 'disastrous decision to bomb Iran without authorization.'\nWhile the Florida-born singer rarely speaks out on politics, her post reaffirmed her willingness to challenge Trump and his supporters directly.\nIn June, she was among more than 100 Hollywood stars who signed an open letter, slamming the Trump administration’s proposal to cut funding for LGBTQ youth suicide prevention programs. \n\nGrande's decision to reshare the post quickly sparked headlines and a pointed response from the Trump administration (the president is seen in June)\n'We are heartbroken by the proposal to eliminate federal funding for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline’s LGBTQ+ Youth Specialized Services — a move that will have devastating, life-threatening consequences for young people across the country,' the letter, published by The Trevor Project, read. \nIt continued: 'As artists, creators, and public figures, our platforms come with responsibility. And today, that responsibility is clear: we must speak out to protect the mental health and lives of LGBTQ+ youth. We will not stay silent.' \nThe letter also stressed that, at a time of deep division that this 'about people, not politics.' \n'No young person should be left without help in their darkest moment. Stripping away this lifeline leaves LGBTQ+ youth with the message that their lives are not worth saving. We refuse to accept that message,' the performers concluded. 'Every LGBTQ+ young person reading this: you are not alone. We see you. We value you.'\n\n'Save your tears, Ariana, because President Trump's actions ended Joe Biden's inflation crisis and are bringing in trillions in new investments,' Kush Desai told the Daily Mail\nOver the years, Grande has repeatedly spoken out against gun violence and has advocated for gun control in the US and other nations.\nIn 2017, her concert at Manchester Arena was the target of a terror attack, which killed 22 people, and injured many more. \nA year later, the performer revealed she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and severe anxiety from the event. \n'I don't think I'll ever know how to talk about it and not cry,' she told British Vogue in 2018. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nWhite House erupts at Ariana Grande after singer torches Trump's record on immigrants and trans rights\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 260\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The next Super Bowl will take place Feb. 8 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, near San Francisco.\n\n“What I’m feeling goes beyond myself,” Bad Bunny said in a statement. “It’s for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture, and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”\n\nBad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, was born in Puerto Rico and rose to fame through hits such as “MIA,” “I Like It,” “Me Porto Bonito” and “Dákiti.” He has been nominated for 10 Grammys, winning in the best música urbana album category for “Un Verano Sin Ti” and “El Último Tour del Mundo,” and in the best Latin pop or urban album category for “YHLQMDLG.” He has also won 12 Latin Grammys.\n\nOn Saturday, Bad Bunny will host the season opener of “Saturday Night Live.”\n\nThis will be the seventh Super Bowl halftime show produced by Roc Nation, the entertainment and sports company founded by billionaire rapper Jay-Z. Its agreement with the NFL came amid tensions over the league’s handling of protests by quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had begun kneeling during the national anthem to protest police violence against people of color.\n\nBad Bunny has been vocal about social issues affecting Puerto Rico. In an interview this month with i-D magazine, he said he did not incorporate the mainland United States into his latest tour because he was fearful his fans would be targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. On Sunday night, shortly before the Super Bowl announcement, Bad Bunny posted on social media that, “after discussing it with my team, I think I’ll do just one date in the United States.”\n\nIn a social media post last fall, Bad Bunny published an eight-minute video in Spanish in which he described his pride for the island. He captioned the post “garbage,” an allusion to when comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” during a campaign rally for Donald Trump. Weeks later, Bad Bunny endorsed Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n“Every time that I express myself about something, I do it because I feel it,” Bad Bunny said in an interview with The New York Times published in January. “It’s not because I’m Bad Bunny and I have 40 million followers and I want to — no. I’m a normal human being and I have feelings and I get mad and I get happy and that’s how I make my music.”\n\nThe next Super Bowl halftime show, sponsored by the streaming service Apple Music, will be broadcast on NBC. The NFL announced Bad Bunny’s selection on social media and during halftime of NBC’s “Sunday Night Football” with a video of the artist sitting atop a yellow goalpost crossbar on a beach. His song “Callaíta” played in the background.\n\n“What Benito has done and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring,” Jay-Z said in a statement. “We are honored to have him on the world’s biggest stage.”\n\nThere had been weeks of rumors that pop star Taylor Swift would be the headliner. Her 21-month Eras Tour, which ended in December, grossed a record $2 billion in ticket sales, and she announced her engagement to the Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce in August after nearly two years of dating. She will release her 12th original studio album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” on Friday.\n\n“We would always love to have Taylor play,” Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, said in a recent interview on the “Today” show, a comment that fed the speculation. “She is a special, special talent, and, obviously, she would be welcome at any time.”\n\nThe NFL in 2019 partnered with Roc Nation, asking the company to produce the Super Bowl halftime shows. Since then, the halftime performances have predominantly featured hip-hop and R&B artists: Lamar, Usher, Rihanna and, in 2022, a medley including Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and Eminem. The partnership’s first Super Bowl halftime show, in 2020, featured Latin music in performances by Jennifer Lopez and Shakira.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n© 2025 The New York Times Company","summary":"Latin superstar Bad Bunny, who has won three Grammys while bringing Spanish-language music to the top of the charts, will headline the Super Bowl halftime show in February, the NFL announced Sunday.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/09/29/breaking-news/bad-bunny-will-headline-super-bowl-halftime-show/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/web1_20250929_brk_bbu01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-29 19:30:00","author":"New York Times","authors":["New York Times"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.231},{"id":364655436,"title":"Highlights From Kamala Harris’ New Memoir","text":"Kamala Harris has released 107 Days, a new memoir detailing her 2024 run for president against Donald Trump.

The second time I watched it, I just got depressed, and drove home in radio silence.\nPlease interpret all that as a thumbs-up review: If Ye has ever meant something to you, whether you’ve since had it up to here with his bullshit or somehow still can’t get enough of said bullshit, you should absolutely see this film while you can. It’s still playing in limited release across the country, and may have pulled in enough money in its first and second weekend to stick around a bit longer—although it’s likely to get knocked out of the cultural conversation (and off more than a few multiplex screens) when Taylor Swift’s The Official Release Party of a Showgirl opens theatrically on Friday. Yes, at least zeitgeist-wise, Taylor is about to interrupt Kanye; if you’re a student of history and/or an afficionado of fridge-temp revenge, I probably don’t have to explain what's both funny and poetic about that.\nThe first time Nico Ballesteros pointed a camera at Kanye West, it was 2018, and West was standing outside an office building in Calabasas, eating a taco from Taco Bell off the rear trunk lid of his Maybach. Ballesteros was only 18 at the time, an aspiring filmmaker from Orange County. He was still in high school, but through studious social-media networking and a few lucky breaks he’d worked his way to the outer edge of Ye’s inner circle. He’d become known to the team at Ye’s Calabasas office—the headquarters of Yeezy, Ye’s fashion brand, but also a more general-purpose creative hub that Ye called “the Energy Center”—as a videographer, and before long he got the call that changed everything. The indie-rock group Francis and the Lights, one of Ye’s favorite bands around that time, were doing a private show at the Yeezy offices, and Ye’s team needed someone to document the event.\nThey told him to come to the office the next day. They told him to bring a night-vision camera. “They were like, ‘Kanye just wants you to film,’” Ballesteros recalls. “‘Just don't stop filming. The moment you find him, just follow him. Don’t stop until somebody says stop.’”\nSo Ballesteros sourced two camcorders with night-vision capability off Craigslist. And the next day, he drove to Calabasas. He’d never been there before. The sun was setting over the rolling hills as he arrived. “It’s, like, this mystical place,” he says. The Yeezy office was a mystical place, too, but one that Ballesteros was more familiar with. He’d spent years observing Ye through the keyhole of social media; he’d seen a million pictures of Ye walking out of this very building.\n“There was so much aura with this office,” he says. “For me to now go there—it was the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory moment.”\nAnd not long after Ballesteros got there, so did Ye. Ballesteros found him outside, standing with the director and photographer Eli Russell Linnetz, and started shooting. Nobody said stop. “He just didn’t acknowledge my presence—in a good way,” Ballesteros says. “He was just enjoying his taco, talking to Eli.”\nYe’s then-wife Kim Kardashian arrived. The concert started. Ballesteros moved through the crowd with his night-vision camera, filming Ye while also taking note of the ecosystem of the room. Creative directors and wannabe creative directors and designers and online demi-celebs. How they interacted with each other, how they spoke, how they navigated the gravitational fields of power in that room.\nThen there was a commotion. Ballesteros saw Ye getting excited. “I whip-pan,” he remembers, “and Elon Musk comes in. And I’m like, ‘Wait a minute. Whoa. This is really interesting.’”\nThe next day, Ballesteros got another call from the team in Calabasas. Ye wanted him to start coming out to the office every day, to film the meetings he was taking there. Ballesteros’ first thought was about how that would work logistically; the drive from Orange County to Calabasas at rush hour takes ninety minutes on the best of days. But he wasn’t about to say “No.”\n\nFor the next six years, wherever Ye went, Ballesteros went with him, filming him more or less continuously, usually with a handheld iPhone. In Whose Name, culled from nearly 3,000 hours of footage Ballesteros collected during that six-year period, is in theaters now. It’s a bleak yet fascinating work of art wholly unlike the authorized, myth-burnishing docu-mercials cluttering up the “Music Documentaries” tab on Netflix or Hulu.\nThere are no talking-head interviews, no narration, and—aside from title cards dividing the story into three acts, like the episodes of a Greek tragedy—no onscreen text to tell us what we’re looking at and why. It doesn’t hold our hands and lead us to a conclusion; it doesn’t attempt to explain Ye’s decisions, or justify them, or condemn them. It just says, Here’s what it was like—what it was like to be Ye, during one of the most chaotic and difficult periods of his rarely-undifficult life, and (by implication) what it was like to be Ballesteros, an iPhone-toting fly on Ye’s wall.\nThose Netflix/Hulu docs are artistically middling in part because they’re usually produced with the cooperation of their subjects, by filmmakers willing to barter away some measure of creative control in exchange for access, music rights, and everything else a documentary filmmaker can’t go without. Ballesteros, by contrast, had Ye’s cooperation, and seemingly-unfettered access to his creative, professional and personal life, but collected all this footage without ever making any kind of formal arrangement with Ye about what he might do with it afterwards; he even used his own credit card to buy the various iPhones he used to shoot it.\nHe and Ye did talk about what they wanted the movie to be. In the beginning, Ye imagined they were making a film about mental health (and in a sense, given that almost everything that happens in the movie could arguably be categorized as a downstream result of Ye’s decision to stop taking psychiatric medication, they sort of have). But he wasn’t involved creatively in the finished product. (He has, though, seen the movie three times, in various stages of completion; Ballesteros says he called the final product “crisp,” which was high praise, and gave the movie his full locked-in attention each time he watched it, which one imagines is even higher praise.)\nIn Whose Name is a more-or-less authorized film that feels like an unauthorized one, something fans might pass around as a Vimeo link, even against their hero’s wishes. Instead, it’s screening in 1,000 theaters across the country—although this almost didn’t happen. Nick Jarjour, Ballesteros’ manager, tells me that in the wake of Ye’s anti-Semitic heel-turn circa 2022, one early distribution deal was yanked off the table almost immediately, and that convincing anyone to even watch the film, let alone distribute it, got significantly harder after that.\n“Somehow it felt like the negativity surrounding Ye had been transferred onto Nico,” Jarjour says. “Every chairman, every streamer, everybody had slammed the door shut.” (Unusually for a high-profile documentary feature, In Whose Name was not screened at even one major film festival; one person familiar with the situation suggests that programmers passed on it out of fear that Ye himself would show up.)\nEventually, though, Jarjour says, he screened the film for Gee Roberson, a film producer and veteran artist manager who’d actually managed Kanye decades earlier and had brokered his deal with Roc-a-Fella Records. Roberson had liked it enough to introduce Jarjour to a “very discreet and powerful operator” within the entertainment industry. And that operator connected them with Simran Singh, a powerful music-business attorney who was also blown away by Nico’s footage. “You don’t get that type of access,” Singh tells me on a Zoom call. “Even documentaries I’ve been part of—they are highly influenced by what the artists involved want to portray, for a lot of reasons. Studios, I think, are afraid of that backlash.”\nThey decided to distribute it independently; Singh flew around the country screening the movie for exhibitors like Cinemark and AMC. “Essentially, we built out a full-fledged theatrical distribution company, just for this film,” Singh says. (When it’s suggested that this is similar to the way Taylor Swift brought out her Eras Tour film, partnering directly with AMC in an end run around the studios, Singh says yes, it is, but points out: “She could have gone anywhere she wanted, anywhere in the world—any company would have taken her,” which was clearly not the case here.) Singh also went on to put millions of dollars of his own money into a marketing campaign for the movie. He is, he says, “heavily invested” in the project, in all senses. “I don’t know if my publicist would advise me to tell people that,” he says, “but, yeah. I do crazy things, man. I do crazy things.”\nWhen I talk to Singh and Jarjour about the movie they both say they fought for it because they believe in Ballesteros, and the film, and what they think it has to say about mental health—namely, that mental-health struggles can take anyone down, even one of the most famous people in America. In the sense that In Whose Name, broadly speaking, serves as a case study of what can happen to someone who stops taking a prescribed psychiatric medication they believe is dimming their natural creativity, a mental-health documentary is exactly what it is. Whether it’s a particularly useful case study is another question; the circumstances it depicts are pretty specific to exactly one person’s extremely rarefied experience.\nKeith Richards once said, after one of his many run-ins with the authorities, that what he had was not a drug problem but a police problem. Ye’s issue, during the era depicted in this movie, is seemingly less that he’s bipolar and has chosen to forego medication and more that he’s bipolar and has chosen to forego medication and someone is constantly putting him in front of a microphone or a camera and broadcasting whatever he says to the entire world, including the publicly-traded companies that are his partners and are then obligated to take action. In some ways, as a rich guy with a catalog of hit records and an influential fashion brand, Ye is more shielded from direct consequences than a more average off-their-meds American, but he also had far more to lose.\n\nJust over a week before In Whose Name opens in theaters, I meet Ballesteros at a post-production facility near Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, to talk about the movie and the years he gave over to making it, and the logistical and psychological effort it took to winnow those 3,000 hours down to the length of a commercially-releasable feature film. (Ballesteros always saw it as a feature, rather than, say, a limited series. The finished version clocks in at a compact 106 minutes; one early cut ran two hours and 40 minutes, before a friend gently told Nico that audiences would probably balk at the idea of sitting through an almost-three-hour documentary, complete with intermission, about anybody, even Kanye West.)\nBallesteros is slim and tall and polite and serious, with a sparse mustache and longish dark hair that makes him look a bit like a young Nick Cave. Today, though, he’s dressed like a young Nick Cave on his way to teach grad-school English in the Texas hill country—silver-tipped belt, reptile cowboy boots, woven summer sport coat.\nHe’s 26, and this is maybe the second or third interview he’s done about the movie that’s consumed his life for seven years. He’s articulate and focused, a complete-thoughts-in-complete sentences type of speaker, but sometimes he gets lost in context, in recounting every single event that led up to some turning point or other, and it takes us forty-five minutes, in conversation, to get to the part of the story where he films Ye eating that taco. At one point he tells me that the story of Jack Kerouac’s “infinite scroll” version of On the Road—the first draft of the book, which Kerouac typed in its entirety on a single 120-foot sheet of paper—influenced his approach to the editing of In Whose Name, a process that at one point involved nine thousand individual strips of paper, each one representing ten to maybe sixty seconds of the film, taped to the walls of an Airbnb in Palm Springs.\nThe day after we have this conversation, he calls me on the phone, and I start to worry that he’s going to ask me to strike some sensitive detail from the record. But it turns out he just wants to fill me in on a trip he took to Paris while making the film, where he met Tony Shafrazi, who’d been Basquiat and Keith Haring’s art dealer once upon a time, and he wants to tell me this because he thinks I should know it was Shafrazi who urged him to read Kerouac. Everything is connected, everything is pivotal; it’s not hard to understand how the movie itself became a bit of an infinite scroll, at least for a while.\nBallesteros first picked up a video camera when he was about eight years old. He started filming his day-to-day life, the way another kind of kid might keep a journal. But the important part was what happened at the end of the day, when he’d run back what he’d shot.\n“I would play the day back on the TV,” he says. “I would relive my day, and try to understand the phenomenology of a lived experience captured and then replayed, and how that feels.”\nLater he’d learn about the psychological phenomenon in which people viewing images in sequence ascribe different emotions to the same picture of a human face depending on what it’s juxtaposed with. This is called the Kuleshov Effect, although of course eight-year-old Ballesteros didn’t know that. He just knew that when he’d hook the camera up to the TV and play his day back on a screen, even things that had happened a few hours earlier seemed to take on a different meaning.\nHe went to Orange County School of the Arts, a public arts charter school in Santa Ana, centrally located between his mother’s house in Fullerton and his father’s house in Mission Viejo. By the time he got there he knew he wanted to make films. But he wasn’t thinking about making the next Star Wars or becoming his generation’s Spielberg. He was interested in the technical side of filmmaking—by the time he was a sophomore, he was working as a DP on other students’ senior-project films—but he didn’t really watch a lot of movies. He watched YouTube, early vloggers like Casey Neistat, and Vice’s gonzo news shows. A documentary-film class lit his brain up. He started to think about nonfiction filmmaking as a space in which he could thrive.\nBack then he still wore regular jeans and button-down shirts, like any other high schooler. Fashion, to him, was something remote—the word made him think of The Devil Wears Prada. But then he started making friends with kids at his school for whom fashion was a subcultural identity with a language and value system all its own—kids who wore Supreme and (yes) Yeezys, and spoke with reverence of “Rick” and “Raf” and “the Antwerp Six.” These kids got Ballesteros interested in hip-hop, streetwear, skateboarding, high fashion, and Japanese style, and the designers and other creatives whose work lived at the intersection of those things, including Virgil Abloh (then the creative director of Ye’s mystery-shrouded creative agency DONDA) and Ye himself.\nThose kids took Ballesteros to see Travis Scott kick off his Rodeo Tour at the Observatory in Santa Ana. And one day in early 2016 they all ditched school to sit in a theater and watch a live stream of Ye unveiling two new projects—his third Yeezy collection for Adidas, and his seventh studio album The Life of Pablo—at Madison Square Garden.\nIt was a pinnacle moment in Ye’s history, a massive crossover event uniting celebrity and subculture, attended by a galaxy of stars. The Kardashians in furs and custom Balmain; everyone from Naomi Campbell to Lil Yachty modeling Ye’s post-apocalyptic athleisure; Travis Scott and A$AP Rocky jumping around like contest winners behind Ye, the man of the hour, as he worked the aux cord in a dad hat and a red I FEEL LIKE PABLO sweatshirt, busting with pride as he premiered what’s still maybe the best music he’s ever made, from gospel-infused instant classics like “Ultralight Beam” and the infamous Taylor Swift-baiting “Famous.”\nIn that moment, on a weekday in February, sitting in an AMC multiplex in Santa Ana watching Ye’s moment of triumph, Ballesteros knew what he wanted to do with his life. He wanted to make a documentary about Ye and the cultural zeitgeist, and how those two forces shaped each other. He’d entered high school intending to go on to USC film school after he graduated; by senior year, the whole idea of college had fallen off his radar. “All my friends are going to NYU,” he remembers. “Some are going to Harvard. Everybody’s going to great schools. And I’m the kid who’s like, No. I’m going to go make a documentary with Kanye.”\nBy then Ballesteros had started making connections with Instagram tastemakers who moved in Ye’s orbit—people like the content creator Kerwin Frost and then-teenage model Luka Sabbat and Instagram fit-pic kingpins known by handles like “Mike the Ruler” and “Asspizza.”\nIn those days, Ballesteros says, it was easier to build a network through friends of friends. “Social media changed,” he says, “because of TikTok. The algorithm now is an intention map, where it just puts everything out at the same level, and anything that gains certain traction can pick up in the algorithm. But back then, it was a social map. So it mattered who followed you, who you followed, who liked your photo. That’s what the algorithm was based around. That was clout culture.”\nHe volunteered to shoot a launch event for a collaboration between Frost’s crew, Spaghetti Boys, and Abloh’s brand Off-White. “I take the photos, the photos go up. Boom—now Virgil’s liking the photos. I’m like, Oh, OK—this is organically happening,” he says.\nAfter that, things moved fast; the degrees of separation between him and Ye began collapsing. “I’m in class, I’m texting people, and they’re like, We’re with Kanye in Malibu. Link up later?”\nBut a number of other things happened before Ballesteros actually met Ye. In October 2016, Ye cut short a show in New York City after learning that Kim Kardashian had been held at gunpoint and robbed in a Paris hotel suite. On November 8, Donald Trump was elected President of the United States. In November, after resuming his Saint Pablo Tour, Ye delivered a 25-minute monologue during a show in San Diego, announcing that if he’d voted that year, it would have been for Trump. On November 21st, Ye announced that he was cancelling the remaining dates of the tour due to exhaustion and stress.\nThat same day, Ye’s trainer Harley Pasternak visited Ye at his home in Los Angeles. Later, in a deposition quoted by The New York Times, Pasternak would say he’d found Ye “writing Bible verses and drawing spaceships on bedsheets with a Sharpie.” A doctor called 911, and Ye was placed on involuntary psych hold at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for nine days. So began a new and strange chapter in Ye’s life and career. In 2017, he revealed that he’d been diagnosed with bipolar disorder during his hospital stay. The following year, he began telling interviewers that he’d stopped taking the psychiatric medications he’d been prescribed, believing that the meds were blunting his creativity.\nBallesteros says Ye’s hospitalization “was when everything changed.” He realized, he says, that the film he wanted to make about Ye would have to be about more than just the cultural union of hip-hop and high fashion: “It’s about something much greater. It’s about the psychology of an artist, and chasing ideas, the consequences of that.”\nHe started reading Freud and Jung, wrestling with big ideas. He was 18 by then; he was, he says, “dealing with a lot of angst, just trying to find myself…I wanted to get out of high school so bad. My senior year was just horrible. I hated being in class. All I wanted was to be with my new friends out in LA or New York, or wherever they were.”\nSo when he got the call about the Francis and the Lights show, he didn’t hesitate. And when they asked him to come back, he came back. He’d wake up in Orange County in the same bed he’d slept in as a kid, push through traffic on the 5 and the 101, and get to Calabasas in time to film Ye meeting with the director Steve McQueen, or The Weeknd, or Spike Jonze, or NFL great Jim Brown, or Drake.\nWhat he didn’t do, at least at first, was talk—not to Ye, anyway, not for a while. There’s footage of the Drake meeting in In Whose Name; we see Ye introduce Drake to Ballesteros. “That was the first day Ye talked to him,” Nick Jarjour says. “He had already been there for months, literally. Like Silent Bob.”\nWhen asked what it was that led Ye to trust him with this much access to the inner workings of the Energy Center on the basis of very little, Ballesteros answers, “Youth.” There were a lot of young people in Ye’s orbit around that time. Jarjour calls them the “culture kids”—would-be artists, would-be designers, would-be documentarians, all looking to trade ideas and intel for clout.\n“These baby Virgils and baby Stanley Kubricks,” Jarjour says, “all hanging out together.”\nBut Ballesteros, Jarjour says, “wasn’t like the other culture kids, who would demand their place, their credit, their name, who would try to outshine the master…Everybody is constantly selling themselves, trying to do this, trying to do that. [Ballesteros] didn’t require any of that validation from Ye or any of those people around, which made him—this is a Hollywood thing to say, but it’s like it made him already a star.”\nWithin a few months of Ballesteros’ arrival on the scene, Jarjour says, “Ye cut everybody else out. He’s like, ‘It’s all about Nico.’”\n\nAt first it was a nine-to-five job, although nine-to-five sometimes meant nine-to-six, or nine-to-7. But before long, Ballesteros found himself in Wyoming, filming at the sessions for Ye’s collaborative album with Kid Cudi, Kids See Ghosts. After that, Ye took a vacation, and Ballesteros took a vacation, but when he got back to California he got word that Ye had a lot of travel coming up and wanted Ballesteros with him.\nAfter that, Ballesteros says, he and his subject started “just jet-setting all over the place.” They went to New York, for a party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Ralph Lauren, and then to Chicago, where they moved into the Waldorf-Astoria for a while. Ballesteros would get up in the morning, walk down a hallway lined with Kanye’s security guards, and knock on the door of Kanye’s room. He’d be in there eating breakfast, doing business on the phone. Nico would start filming. And then, boom, Kanye would get another idea—like when he decided he wanted to work with the rapper 6ix9ine, because he wanted to work with people who’d been cancelled, and it turned out that 6ix9ine was in Colombia, so Ye and Ballesteros went to Colombia.\nThat was where Kanye drew a little sketch of Ballesteros, just a mouthless face with sunglasses and a fringe of hair, filming with his iPhone, and captioned it “NICO WITH THE CAMERA,” and posted it on his Instagram, and after that Ballesteros was a visible mystery man, a known satellite in Kanye’s galaxy, part of the Yeezy Extended Universe. People on Reddit and Instagram had been taking note of his presence in the background of photos, but NICO WITH THE CAMERA made him, he says. “I was like, ‘Okay, this is official. This is who I am now.’”\n“He grew his own weird cult following,” Jarjour says, “that was 99% art-house creative kids. He built this little culture around him that’s really based on, You can take nothing and turn it into something. This kid with an iPhone that followed Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, the biggest celebrities in the world at that time, twenty-four hours a day.”\nTwenty-four hours a day is an exaggeration, but only slightly—whenever Ye was working, Ballesteros was there filming, sometimes for eighteen hours at a time. After that he’d go back to wherever they were staying, order something off the late-night menu, shower and get to sleep by three or four o’clock in the morning, and the next day he’d be up at seven, packing bags and charging batteries while doing what he could to archive the previous day’s footage. The clips were unwieldy—sometimes he’d shoot for two hours straight, but shooting for eight hours wasn’t unheard of.\n“I didn’t want to stop recording, ever,” he says, “because I felt like if I stopped, lo and behold, that would be the only moment that I missed, the most important moment ever.” It got to the point, he says, “where I just started buying more iPhones. If I filled up a phone and I didn’t have time to dump [the contents], I would just buy another phone on my credit card and keep it going.”\nHe wouldn’t eat when everybody else ate, because he’d be busy filming everybody else eating and couldn’t put the camera down. “Eventually,” he says, “what happened was I would do this thing where I’d prop the phone up on a glass of orange juice and eat some eggs. I did eventually do that, but in the beginning, I'm just so in it and thinking, \"I got to document and I got to be present.\" And I don't want to break the fourth wall in a way or become a part of the mise en scène. I wanted the mise en scène to be untouched by me.”\nSome of what he captured was banal. But only some of it, according to documentary filmmaker Justin Staple, who was one of the first editors to try cutting a movie out of Ballesteros' footage and has an co-executive-producer credit on In Whose Name. “This is someone who wanted to creative-direct the world, to change the world, and was becoming the richest Black man in America, and all these historic things,” Staple says. “And the 3,000 hours were highly, highly watchable. Every day, all of it could have been usable, in some sense.”\nAround the time Ballesteros began following him with a camera, Ye became one of the most controversial entertainers in America—or maybe one of the most controversial people, period. He’d touched the third rail of the culture before—with his off-script declaration that “George Bush doesn’t care about Black people” during a 2005 telethon for Hurricane Katrina relief, by interrupting Taylor Swift’s Grammy acceptance speech, and by tweeting “BILL COSBY INNOCENT!!!!!!!!!!” in 2016, after more than fifty women had accused the comedian of sexual misconduct.\nBut in December 2016, he visited Trump Tower to meet with a President-elect most of his liberal fans viewed as an ascendant supervillain. By 2018, he’d become Trump’s most visible Black supporter, tweeting approvingly about the President’s “dragon energy”; that September, he wore a MAGA hat during a performance on Saturday Night Live, then delivered an extended rant, cut from the live broadcast, about the liberal media, “monolithic thought,” and his support for the President. A month later, Ye visited the Oval Office, where he hugged the President in front of news cameras while Trump grinned his best canary-eating I-love-this-crazy-guy grin.\n\nChances are you remember most of this stuff; it wasn’t that long ago. Ye tweeted about, and then started palling around with, conservative commentator and onetime Turning Point USA communications director Candace Owens. Owens' onetime boss Charlie Kirk shows up very briefly in the film, which is an odd coincidence for a movie released this month, but it's Owens who seems to have gotten in Ye's head early and often; it's Owens we see in the movie diagramming for Ye, on a dry-erase board, how politics is downstream from culture. You may recall the Paris fashion show where Ye and Owens showed up in matching t-shirts that read WHITE LIVES MATTER, a provocation about on par with any other idea ever hatched, as this one appears to have been, inside the offices of the Daily Wire. And then not long after that, as if looking for a hotter stove to place his hand on than the idea that Black Lives Matter was a scam, Ye started making increasingly overt anti-Semitic comments and social-media posts, like the instantly-infamous tweet in which he announced plans to take a nap and then go “death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE.”\nIn Whose Name doesn’t answer, or attempt to answer, the bigger question that’s hung in the air throughout Ye’s years-long MAGA-morphosis—namely, whether his support for Trump (and later, his avowed anti-Semitism) was something he actually believed, or a vast lib-triggering performance piece concocted by an artist so averse to being told what to do that he felt obligated to hurl himself against the new social barricades of the so-called “woke” era, over and over, even at the cost of his career.\nWhether “death con 3” was an actual heartfelt statement of hatred or a shitpost or a mentally ill man’s cry for help—and it was probably all of the above—it accelerated things precipitously. Ye continued to say and type out-of-pocket statements about Jewish people. He went on the podcast Drink Champs and bragged, “I can say anti-Semitic shit and Adidas cannot drop me.” Adidas then dropped him. Around the same time, the Gap (which had continued to sell products from a cobranded Yeezy Gap line even after Ye announced that he was terminating his two-year-old partnership with the retailer) pulled all Yeezy items from its stores and Web site, citing Ye’s recent public statements. By month’s end, Balenciaga, CAA, JP Morgan Chase, and Vogue magazine (a Condé Nast publication, as is GQ) had also cut ties with Ye.\nThis is more or less where the film leaves off; by the time Ye fired off the “death con 3” tweet, Ballesteros had also started to distance himself from his subject, less because of the growing controversies and more because he’d amassed a mountain of footage since 2018 and felt the need to bring the project to some kind of conclusion. They met and filmed sporadically after that; in the last third of the movie, the time-jumps between scenes become noticeably bigger, as if Ye is accelerating toward some career-derailment event horizon. Which he kind of was. In the years since Ballesteros finally stopped filming new material for the doc, Ye has veered into more and more indefensible territory while producing very little art worth separating from the artist.\nAs such, In Whose Name feels a bit like a time capsule. The Ye it depicts is unreasonable and impolitic and a bit of a screamer, but seems like a not-terrible hang in comparison to the Ye of 2025, a self-proclaimed Nazi who makes songs like “Heil Hitler” and “Cousins” (in which he claims to have engaged in sexual activity, at 14, with a cousin half his age) and seems to have recently exhausted the patience, or possibly the conscience, of the venal novelty rapper Dave Blunts, a collaborator who allegedly said, in a text exchange bringing their partnership to a close, that Ye was “very lost” and needed to “Find God.” We need not relitigate the other data points here: the “I LOVE HITLER” tweets, the Super Bowl ad directing interested shoppers to a Web site selling swastika-branded Yeezy t-shirts, the pileup of lawsuits from former employees and the disturbing allegations made therein, the rumors about Ye abusing both AI and nitrous oxide, or the YZY memecoin whose launch he announced after declaring that memecoins “PREY ON THE FANS WITH HYPE”—except to point out that all of those things happened this year alone.\nAlso this year, in March, when Ye met with the YouTube personality DJ Akademiks for a hotel-room interview, he arrived in street clothes before changing into a black Ku Klux Klan hood and robe and a bejeweled swastika medallion. In the video, he proceeds to unleash the full stream of his aggrieved consciousness circa 2025, alleging conspiracies against Sean “Diddy” Combs and Playboy Carti and “the kid from Linkin Park” and railing against enemies such as “the Jews,” “the whites above the Jews,” Universal Music Group chairman Lucian Grainge, Jay-Z and Beyoncé, “street n*ggas” and “faggot-ass celebrities,” the National Football League, Kamala Harris and Barack Obama, former GOOD Music recording artist John Legend (for “wearing sweaters in motherfuckin’ Barbados”) and even his late friend and collaborator Virgil Abloh. When Akademiks asks Ye a question about the Abloh beef—an unusual one, in that it seems to postdate Abloh’s death, of cancer, in 2021, an event Ye publicly mourned at the time—Ye responds simply, “I’m evil,” his voice under the hood as coldly venomous as the Riddler or the Zodiac speaking.\nAkademiks is, let's say, unprepared to steer this encounter toward substantive dialogue; over the course of an hour and change, he just kind of hangs on to the Grand Dragon’s tail for dear life. Akademiks does make one provocative observation, though, pointing out that Ye is proof that “cancellation” doesn’t work—and he is probably right about this, because few people have ever been more cancelled than Ye, and yet we will still be thinking about him for the rest of our goddamn lives, even as Ye keeps on pushing through to whatever unknown public status lies on the other side of cancellation, doing everything he can think of to render himself repugnant, as if trying to prove that whatever love America once professed for him was always false and conditional underneath it all.\nIn a silly interlude on The Life of Pablo, Ye rhymes knowingly about fans who moan about missing the “old Kanye\" (and who lament \"I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye.\") The one constant in our lives as Kanye fans is that there's always a new Kanye around the corner. Past performance being indicative, this means that just as In Whose Name is enough to make you miss a Kanye who was actively becoming a pariah, a newer iteration of Ye may come along one day to make us miss the guy who made all that AI slop with Dave Blunts.\nBut you never know. Somebody told me he's doing better of late. I'm as ready for this to be the case as I've been since 2016. One of my favorite artists of all time is Bob Dylan, who during his Christian period cursed the unbelievers of Sodom from the stage (and around the same time, told one rebellious audience, “You can go and see Kiss, and you can rock and roll all the way down to the pit!”); another of my favorite artists of all time is David Bowie, who in 1976 at the height of the Station to Station cocaine-bullet-train period he would later claim to barely remember, told a press conference “As I see it, I am the only alternative for the premier in England…I believe Britain could benefit from a fascist leader. After all, fascism is really nationalism,” and later called Hitler “one of the first rock stars” in an interview with young Cameron Crowe. Both Dylan and Bowie went on to write more chapters in their books; they also went through their cancellable phases before social media existed. When Bowie put out Let's Dance in 1983 there was no way to Google “David Bowie + Nazi” like I did a second ago while writing this paragraph. Charlie Sheen is not one of my favorite artists, but even he's on the comeback trail now, and it didn't take that long. It felt like we talked about \"tiger blood\" for two solid years, but these days, who can remember?\nBallesteros tells me that he wanted In Whose Name to be more than a movie about Kanye West—that he wanted it to act as a mirror, a Rorschach test, not just a study of Ye’s downfall but something historians could watch in the future to understand the historical moment in which it took place. The finished film opens with the epigram “Dedicated to America, whatever that is,” from Kerouac’s Visions of Cody, a posthumously-published quasi-novel that revisits some of the same territory as On the Road, morphing Neal Cassady into the fictional “Cody Pomeroy.” Ballesteros liked what Kerouac wrote in the author’s note to that book: “Instead of just a horizontal account of travels on the road, I wanted a vertical metaphysical study of Cody’s character and its relationship to the general ‘America.’” That idea, Ballesteros tells me, after Googling the quote and reading it to me off his phone, “was my number-one inspiration.”\nIn its years-long engagement with its subject and the way its pace makes you feel the protractedness of that engagement even as the airplane-dream editing blurs the passage of time, Ballesteros’ film feels at least like a metaphorical expression of the defining characteristic of America’s relationship with Ye—our inability to stop paying attention to him, no matter how upsetting our enmeshment becomes, or how complicit it makes us feel in his downfall. What else the historians of tomorrow will get out of In Whose Name is hard to predict. Its perspective is pretty tightly locked on one particular American, albeit one who gets tossed around more than most by the tempest that is the last five or six years of American history. But maybe it's a vertical metaphysical study of America in that the same powerful brain-warping forces that were waiting to bombard Kanye West the minute he stopped taking his medication—the cosmic rays of troll-farm ideology—are working on all of us, every day, and Ye is just one canary in a country-sized coal mine.\nAs Carl Jung is supposed to have said to James Joyce after analyzing Joyce's schizophrenic daughter Lucia, “You are both submerged in the same water, but you are swimming, and she is drowning.” The fact that most of us don't currently behave like Ye doesn't mean we're any less inherently vulnerable to the delusion that we're not delusional. If there's anything we should all understand after the last five or six years, either by observation of society or by observation of our own lives, it's that it feels good as hell to slip into paranoid unreason if you can convince yourself you're finally waking up. It certainly seems to feel good for Ye in this movie, except when it really, really doesn't.\n\nBallesteros didn’t actually film inside of the Oval Office, by the way—the footage of the Trump meeting that appears in the movie is from a TV-news feed. But he was there on the ride in, sitting in the back of a bulletproof SUV with Ye, watching him demand to be admitted to the White House through the same entrance a visiting head of state would use, telling Jared Kushner over the phone, “I put my life in danger by wearing the [MAGA] hat and I need to be loved and respected as such.”\n“I didn’t really feel a type of way for not being in the room,” Ballesteros says, “because I was like, ‘Well, that room”—and what was about to happen there—“is already so publicized.’ What always interested me was the quiet moments before and after those things.”\nBut in the movie, after the White House visit, even the quiet moments start getting pretty noisy. In Whose Name is also, in flashes, a close-up study of the Kardashian-West marriage as it frays; in one tense phone conversation, after Kim warns Ye that if he continues to burn bridges (by, for example, referring to the corporations he does business with as “slave ships”) he could wake up one day and have nothing, Ye screams at her, telling her to never put that idea out into the world.\nThis section of the film becomes a little movie unto itself about Ye screaming at women. Ye’s voice rings off the walls of Kim’s mausoleum-like Axel Vervoordt kitchen as he browbeats Kris Jenner about his hospitalization, asking “Did you have an effect on my mental health?”; Kris says yes, then breaks down crying. (Ballesteros is briefly visible here, a lanky shadow reflected in a window.) And then we’re in Uganda, in a makeshift recording studio inside some kind of glampy geodesic tent, watching Ye scream at his cousin, Kim Mitchell.\nWhat's at issue in this moment is murky—something about a possible threat to Ye’s life, and a difference of opinion between the security detail he’d brought with him and the local guys he’d hired on the ground as to whether it was safer to fly home immediately or spend the night in the bush and leave in the morning. Or maybe he's upset because he's been told he can't broker a meeting between Ugandan president Yoweri Musveni and the opposition leader Bobi Wine.\nBut by only letting us catch what we can of that context, the film shifts the focus to the immediate impact of Ye’s paranoia—a common symptom of bipolar disorder—on the people around him. It’s unclear if any actual danger has presented itself but you can feel everybody’s cortisol levels spiking; Kim Kardashian seems to be coming to grips with the extent of her husband’s mental-health issues in real time, in front of Ballesteros’ camera.\n“I remember thinking, ‘This will pass. This is just the moment,’” Ballesteros says. But he left Uganda early. When he landed at LAX, he drove straight to Big Sur, pitched a tent, and spent the night there, trying to process what he’d just experienced. Ultimately, he decided to keep following the story—“I feel like that’s what I’m called to do,” he remembers thinking, “and like that’s what [Ye] wants as well.”\nNick Jarjour says this dynamic continued throughout Ballesteros’ time with Ye. “The lifestyle and the excess mixed with the extreme episodes that he was experiencing every single day, mixed with the creative genius,” he says, “created this thing that he wanted to leave, but always wanted to go back to every morning.” Jarjour says he wrestled with the ethics of not stopping Ballesteros from going back into a situation that seemed to be taking a dark turn. After a while, he says, “it was almost like a wellness-check system that me and him had, where as long as he knows he’s got enough oxygen in the tank, boom—he’d go back down for another SCUBA mission.”\n\nAfter Uganda we see Ye telling someone over the phone that he’s stepping back from politics to focus on architecture and parenting. These moments are a kind of refrain in the film; later, he says he’s getting out of the fashion industry to focus on schools and sustainable architecture. This is also a movie about a guy who’s decided that his job is revolutionizing things, and wanders the world looking for something to revolutionize. Ye seems to be forever in search of some new arena he can enter where what he has to offer will finally be properly valued; when he’s not immediately greeted as a genius, or encounters any friction at all, it proves every point he’s trying to make about the forces arrayed against him, and soon enough it’s on to the next arena. One battle after another.\nHe’s also, seemingly, forever searching for some higher calling to surrender himself to. First it’s Trumpism. Then it’s God, via his “Sunday Service” events at Coachella and elsewhere. He goes to Houston, where he speaks at Joel Osteen’s megachurch but also leads a gospel choir inside the county jail. The incarcerated worshippers wear orange, the choir wears blue. Like the Sunday Service sequences, the scene is a reminder that even after he put on the red hat, Ye could still create moments of striking beauty, reaching in his art (in his music, yes, but also in the clean and minimal and aesthetically-unified look and feel of his stage presentations, his clothing and shoe designs, and the interiors of the spaces where he lives and works) for a degree of calm and spaciousness and order he seems utterly incapable of cultivating in his actual life.\nThe Jesus period is just a moment, though. It doesn’t last. In the film Ye always seems to be building something and abandoning it, like the futuristic moon-colony we see him constructing in the wilds of Wyoming (on property since “left to rot,” per one tabloid.) He ramps up again. In 2020, on the Fourth of July, he announces he’s running for President as a third-party candidate, despite it being too late for his name to appear on the ballot in at least six states. At one campaign event, he gets onstage in a bulletproof vest in Charleston, South Carolina, rails against guns and porn and Percocet, and breaks down scream-crying about how he and Kim almost made the decision to abort North: “I almost killed my daughter.”\nIn 2021, reportedly under contractual pressure to deliver a finished version of his tenth album Donda to Def Jam/Universal, he moves into Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, paying (again, reportedly) somewhere between $150,000 and one million dollars a day to live in a locker room and work around the clock until the record is finished. We watch him go off, James Brown/Buddy Rich style, on some of his Donda guest rappers for not taking the mission seriously; Rick Rubin sits behind him, approvingly bobbing his head as if this rant is Ye’s new music, and on some level, who’s to say it isn’t? Eventually a listening party does occur—he burns down a replica of his childhood home, he stages a surreal mock wedding with his soon-to-be-ex-wife Kim as a veiled corpse-bride, he sets himself on fire.\nAnd Marilyn Manson’s there, for some reason, hanging out on the replica porch of Ye's replica house. Why the fuck is he there? His presence robs Ye of whatever shred of moral authority his crusade against cancel culture might have had. When Donda launched, Marilyn Manson wasn’t cancelled because liberal society couldn't handle his ideas. Marilyn Manson doesn't have ideas. Marilyn Manson was considered cancelled, in that moment, because he’d been accused of psychological and sexual abuse by at least six women, including his former partner Evan Rachel Wood. But his presence does give Ballesteros’ film its best comic-book-movie image—a low-angle shot of Manson, Playboi Carti in Pennywise clown makeup, and the stylist Burberry Erry, a punk with an enormous head of liberty spikes, looking down at Ye from the top of a small flight of stairs. They look like supervillains, seemingly beckoning him to walk up there and take his place in their Legion of Doom, to join them on the Dark Side of the Force. Manson doesn’t seem to have become a fixture of Ye’s world, but they hung out a couple of times and since then Ye’s entered the Going Door To Door Trying To Shock People phase of his career. I refuse to believe this is entirely coincidental.\n\nBallesteros imagined Donda might be the end of his movie: Ye survives it all and turns his album rollout into a darkly majestic opera depicting the loss of his marriage and his public immolation, turning personal devastation into an aesthetic triumph. It would have made for a nice, clean arc. But then “death con 3” happened, and the Adidas and Gap deals blew up, and that became the climax of the story instead.\nBy then, Ballesteros says, he’d already started to feel like whatever story he’d been telling was approaching a natural endpoint. He rattles off events that felt like signs: Virgil Abloh had died. Ten fans had been trampled to death at a Travis Scott concert. The whole zeitgeist Ballesteros had once yearned to capture in a film seemed to be dissipating. Even the Yeezy office in Calabasas closed; temporary spaces came and went after that, and for a time Ye worked out of a warehouse in downtown Los Angeles. Ballesteros went there on occasion, and it’s there that he captures a great moment in which Ye decides to prove he’s not an anti-Semite by bringing out his Jewish friend, who turns out to be cancelled American Apparel founder Dov Charney. But it wasn’t the same; there was no longer a fixed center to Ye’s universe.\nMaybe more importantly, Ballesteros wasn’t the kid who’d walked into the Energy Center with a night-vision camera and a dream anymore. He’d begun to think of his unmade movie as a coming-of-age film, even if its autobiographical component would never be apparent to anyone but him; having now come of age, he felt it was time to close the book on the story.\nBy then Ballesteros had attracted his own coterie of culture kids, people he trusted and had tried to bring along professionally, he says, “in the same way that I saw Virgil develop people, in the same way I saw Ye develop people.” One of them was Jack Russell, another aspiring filmmaker who’d moved to L.A. from Idaho a few years earlier and pestered Ballesteros with replies to his Instagram stories until finally Ballesteros broke down and said, Let’s meet.\nBallesteros was renting a tiny house in Pacific Palisades, steps from the beach; they called it The Dojo. Toward the end of Ballesteros’ time with Ye, he and Russell became roommates there, and Russell took it upon himself to start logging and organizing all of Ballesteros’ Ye footage, which at the time was stored on over fifty different LaCie hard drives scattered around the Dojo.\n“That was my job,” Russell says, “because no one wanted to do it. Nico, basically, psychologically, couldn’t do it. He was like, ‘I just can’t relive my own life in totality again. It’s just so overwhelming.’ So I was like, ‘I’ll do it. I’ll watch it all, label it all, put it all in order, figure out which hard drive it’s on, make sure it all links together.”\nIn the summer of 2022, after taking about five months off from filming the movie, Ballesteros went to see Ye, who was staying at a hotel in Los Angeles. He didn’t film; they just talked. Ballesteros told him about the footage he and Jack had been logging, acting out scenes: And then you said this, and then Jacques Herzog said this. And Ye listened, and then said, “We got to start filming again.”\nBallesteros said, Definitely.\nThe last leg of the journey might have been the most intense phase of the process. “We would go to London, and then we’d be back in LA, and then we’d go to Paris, and we might go back to London. We’d go to Tennessee and then we’d be back in LA. We went back and forth between Europe and LA, I kid you not, probably 20 times in the span of three weeks, or something wild like that.” Ballesteros remembers sleeping on a lot of planes, touching down in three or four time zones over the course of a few days; things got pretty blurry.\n“I was there with him in some of the most exhausted states of mind toward the end,” Jack Russell says. “I could see, visibly, how tired he would be, and I don’t know how he would do it. He would wake up at 7:00 AM and get back at it the next day.”\nAt some point Russell finished cataloguing everything Ballesteros had shot to that point; having caught up, he’d ingest each day’s new material, living Nico’s life on a one-day delay. “It was like, ‘You can go out and shoot, and just know I’ll be here labeling and cutting what you did the prior days, and when you get back I’ll make sure there’s some food to eat. I’ll even make sure your bag’s packed, whatever,’” Russell says. “I was kind of just holding down those little details just so he could keep going.”\nBallesteros remembers being in New York with Ye around this time, asking him “Have you ever thought about how long you may want me to film you?” Ye thought about it and said, “I was just thinking, maybe one day North grows up”—meaning, in his mind, eventually Ballesteros would be there (with an iPhone 46 or whatever) to document that, too.\n“I remember, I was just like, ‘Yeah!’ I was just so in it,” Ballesteros says. “I was like, ‘Yeah, man—that could be a part of the story.”\nIt could have gone on forever: Ye living his big and ever-more-complicated life, Ballesteros bearing witness, Ye forever doing or saying some new crazy thing that would change what that story was, and Jack Russell back home in the dojo, logging footage, keeping Ballesteros fed and logistically backstopped. A stable system. In a way, “death con 3” and its cascading consequences gave Ballesteros his life back.\n“I was like, ‘Well, this is an end to the story, for now.’ I felt called to take a step back,” he says. “I was like, ‘All right. I’m going to go edit the film now.’”\nHe’d been getting calls from reporters looking for comment on Ye's situation; he changed his phone number, got off social media. He went home for Thanksgiving, drove north to Carmel and stayed at the La Playa, the resort hotel where Steve Jobs unveiled the prototype of the Macintosh during a retreat with his Apple development team in 1983; the ensuing celebration, which involved alcohol, a beach bonfire, and skinny-dipping, got Apple banned from the place for almost 30 years.\nIt was there that Ballesteros decided he needed to get out of the country. “I feel like in order to tell this story,” he told his team, “I need to get out of America, because it’s such an American story that I need to reset.”\nSo Ballesteros, Russell, and a third friend-turned-story-editor—a theater actor and writer named Shy Ranje who Ballesteros had met in 2019 and bumped back into years later—packed everything (the hard drives, a server, some ultra-wide monitors) into padded Pelican cases and took everything to a house in the jungle down in Costa Rica, where they worked on the movie for an entire year.\nThis was partly a security measure; in the wake of Ye’s public implosion, plenty of media outlets would probably have killed to get their hands on 3,000 hours of unedited Ye footage. (When I meet Ballesteros, all that material is under lock and key in a vault in Beverly Hills, like in the Gatlin Brothers song about all the gold in California.) But why Ballesteros and Co. felt it necessary to get this far away—why they decided to take their hard drives to the fucking jungle for a year—is harder for everyone involved to explain.\n“I don’t know if there really is a cohesive, sensible answer,” Jack Russell says, when asked why they couldn’t have just moved their operation up the 405 to Pacoima and put their cell phones in a drawer. “It was not, in hindsight, super logical or easy, as far as transporting the hard drives and computers. That was a big part of the story in the beginning—just, logistics.”\n“It was just this big thing,” he says. “We set off into the world. I think we did it for the story, in some ways. I wouldn’t say I could say that for Nico, but it felt that way.”\n“I was honestly just really inspired, I guess you could say, by people like Kanye,” Ballesteros says, “and [his] idea of, ‘We gotta go to Hawaii to make the album.’ So, I was like, ‘We got to go to Costa Rica.’”\nA year flew by. After that would come a gradual process of reintegration, of bringing the movie together and bringing it into the world—Ballesteros decided that having spent that time in the jungle, they needed to go to the desert, and that’s when they taped all those strips of paper to the wall in Palm Springs, and then after that they holed up at the Chateau, and Ballesteros and Justin Staple sat with a six-hour cut of the movie, carving it down to size, and in time they had something Ballesteros could show to other people.\nThat part of the process—showing it to people, hearing what they think—will continue through opening weekend, when Ballesteros will bounce around watching it on different big screens in theaters all over town, with audiences that he’s surprised to discover are full of teenagers, kids around the age Ballesteros was when he watched the Life of Pablo livestream at that Santa Ana AMC. At one screening he’ll get recognized after it’s over; one of those kids in the crowd will ask him to sign a copy of Ye’s Graduation, an album that came out when Ballesteros was seven years old, as if he’d had something to do with making it.\nIt’s possible that those teenage fans are an endlessly renewable resource, that as long as there are new culture kids coming of age and looking to define themselves, Ye will never stop making new fans. Whether any of those fans will make anything as profound as In Whose Name is harder to say. At one point in our conversation Justin Staple points out that by enlisting someone to film him all day every day, Ye anticipated the rise of the “streamers”—the Kai Cenats and IShowSpeeds of the world, who’ve made always-on reality shows from just hanging out and doing whatever.\nYe himself has spent some time in front of streamers’ cameras of late, as if he misses being the subject of someone’s endless movie. He used to have Nico; now he has Sneako. It feels like a downgrade. Streamers, by definition, exist to pull eyes and fill time and build brands, nothing more. Narrative isn’t the point; scale and reach and sponsorship deals are. The camera is just there to feed information to the Internet, to the chat. It’s not there to capture—or, at any rate, no one will ever bother to ingest what it records and place it in context or arrange it into a story. In the end, In Whose Name is a sad movie not just because it’s a record of a genius blowing up his whole life through a series of unforced errors, but because it may be the last time anyone puts this much time and care into presenting his life as a story. Ye is an irresistible subject and there will always be someone else ready to point a camera at him—but it's hard to imagine he'll ever be seen quite this clearly again.","summary":"In Whose Name, a documentary about West shot over six years by first-time filmmaker Nico Ballesteros, follows Kanye through the wormhole of cancellation and out the other side.","url":"https://www.gq.com/story/one-last-look-at-the-old-kanye-west","image":"https://media.gq.com/photos/68daa72ad3e262f1e3c82421/16:9/w_1520,h_855,c_limit/Ye%20hand%20on%20head.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-29 18:17:34","author":"Alex Pappademas","authors":["Alex Pappademas"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.084},{"id":364609600,"title":"Bad Bunny to perform at Super Bowl halftime despite Trump immigration policies halting US tour","text":"View this post on Instagram \n\nEntertainment company Roc Nation picked Bad Bunny to perform.

(WSVN) - New audio recordings of alleged controversial comments in the classroom have landed a South Florida teacher under investigation and reassigned.\n\nControversial comments in the class room were brought to light after a student recorded her teacher’s rant the day after conservative political activist Charlie kirk was killed.\n\nSteven Babice, a teacher at Everglades High School in Miramar, got into a heated disagreement with a student in his classroom, and many believe that Babice crossed a line by cursing and bringing his own political beliefs into the classroom. \n\nBabice: […]”Because you’re going to go vote for Kamala Harris and she’s going to f*** you,”[…]”I grew up white okay everybody I know was taught to not be racist we’re all equal that’s what we were taught then I become an adult and guess what I find out as an adult that black people are taught to hate white people so who’s the racist”\n\n7News spoke with the mother of the student who recorded the incident, and masked her voice to keep her identity private. \n\n“My initial reaction was I was appalled It was okay to say this if he was having drinks with his buddies, it was okay to vent with his children, his wife, but to a classroom full of 18 and 17-year-old kids, absolutely not,” said the concerned mother. “He told them that things could be open discussion, but as soon as the child said, Charlie Kirk was a racist, he kicked him out.”\n\nThe student claimed that Babice also said that Charlie Kirk had done more for black people than people like Barack Obama did. \n\nThe concerned mother said that not only did he go off on a tangent, but he also became physically aggressive in the class. \n\n“Why should our children have to sit in a classroom and see a man pound his fist into a desk, my daughter doesn’t even see that at home,” said the mother.\n\nBabice:”How come there’s a parade and riots and murders and burning cities down? Because George Floyd, a career criminal, died. But when that white girl on the train got stabbed in the neck, just whispers.”[…]”Why do black people hate white people? Because the cops are killing blacks? Is that what’s going on? Are more whites getting shot by cops than blacks? Somebody say yes, because that’s the fact.”\n\nUltimately, Babice kicked the student out of his class, and can be heard in the recording very displeased talking about the teenager in a controversial manner. \n\nBabice: “The black kid’s got the balls to say it to me, he don’t know, he’s ignorant to the whole situation.” \n\nStudents at the school say they’re not really surprised by the teacher’s words. \n\n“That’s like one thing about him. That was his whole like persona. I feel like he was a very like a political guy,” said a former student of Babice, Ahmed Dogan.\n\n7News then asked him if he could tell which way Babice swung politically, and Dogan said yes.\n\n“Yeah, 100%, everyone did, it was like a matter of time that something like this happened,” responded Dogan.\n\nAnother student, suggesting that bias’s should be left out if politics are going to be brought up by educators.\n\n“If teachers want to bring politics into a classroom, they should definitely take the nonpartisan route of it,” said Taylor Berry.\n\nBroward County Public Schools released a statement on the situation that reads as follows,\n\n“We take all allegations seriously and will thoroughly investigate to ensure our learning environments remain safe, respectful, and inclusive for every student and family. The employee in question has been reassigned pending the outcome of the investigation.”\n\n“This is not hearsay, this is not the child’s word against the teacher’s word, you heard it for yourself, what more do you need?” Said the mother.\n\nThe teacher had previously been reprimanded by the school district, and the mother says she will use this as a learning lesson for her daughter on how to have proper political discourse even when you disagree.\n\nCopyright 2025 Sunbeam Television Corp.

Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”\n\nThe Grammy-winning singer, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, also a shared congratulatory post from California Gov. Gavin Newsom on social media. “California is excited to welcome you to Super Bowl LX,” Newsom wrote.\n\nMoreover, local support for Bad Bunny’s upcoming starring role in the “one of the most anticipated and iconic musical performances in the world” came from the Bay Area Host Committee president and CEO Zaileen Janmohamed.\n\n“We are confident that Bad Bunny will deliver an unforgettable experience for fans in Levi’s Stadium and watching globally,” Janmohamed said in a news release. “This selection further amplifies the Bay Area’s position as a premier destination for world-class events, and we look forward to a spectacular show that showcases the unique spirit and diversity of our region.”\n\nIndeed, the Super Bowl is consistently the most-watched television program of the year, with more than 130 million people viewing last season’s Halftime Show featuring rapper Kendrick Lamar, the New York Times reported.\n\nThis fact was not lost on right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, who amassed more than 39,000 likes for a post on X in which he shared a laundry list of grievances against Bad Bunny, aka Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, a global superstar, known for such hits as “MIA,” “I Like It,” “Me Porto Bonito”” and “Dákiti.”\n\n“Massive Trump hater; Anti-ICE activist; No songs in English … The NFL is self-destructing year after year,” Johnson wrote. He also cited Bad Bunny’s statement about refusing to incorporate the mainland United States into his latest tour because of concerns that his fans would be targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nIn response to Bad Bunny’s concerns about ICE raids, someone, replying to Johnson’s post, said that ICE should be at the Super Bowl, checking people’s papers, “especially Bad Bunny’s crew and their families. This is how we heal as a nation.”\n\nPerhaps anticipating such a response, Bad Bunny posted on social media before the Super Bowl announcement: “After discussing it with my team, I think I’ll do just one date in the United States.”\n\nAnother Trump-aligned pundit, Robby Starbuck, railed against the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell for making the Super Bowl “political” by building a halftime show around Bad Bunny. “The guy literally says he isn’t touring the U.S. because of Trump’s ICE raids and just released a video mocking President Trump,” Starbuck wrote on X. “This is not a pick designed to unite football fans or let people just enjoy the show. It was a pick designed to divide fans and no doubt Bad Bunny will find some way to push a woke message.”\n\n“Does this guy really scream American football to anyone?” Starbuck continued. “Be for real with me. No one thinks he does. This isn’t about music, it’s about putting a guy on stage who hates Trump and MAGA.”\n\nConservative journalist Owen Shroyer called for a more MAGA-friendly halftime show, according to the Daily Beast. He said such a show could be led by Creed, whose frontman Scott Stapp is the brother-in-law of Mike Waltz, Trump’s former national security adviser who was just named ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nIn recent weeks, there also had been rumors that Taylor Swift could be the halftime act for Super Super Bowl LX, while Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich recently told Howard Stern that it would be “a dream come true” for his band to perform at this Super Bowl because it’s being played in the Bay Area. But he also said they had not been approached.\n\nAs for Bad Bunny being a “political choice,” he has been vocal about social issues affecting Puerto Rico, according to news reports. He also threw his support behind Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election, following an offensive comment that comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made about Puerto Rico at a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden in October. Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” and said that Latinos “love making babies.”\n\nIn endorsing Trump’s opponent, Bad Bunny shared a video from Harris in which she said: “There’s so much at stake in this election for Puerto Rican voters and for Puerto Rico.” Harris also decried Trump’s response to Hurricane Maria in 2017 during his first administration, when the Republican leader came off as anything but “a caring and competent leader.” At the time, Trump drew criticism while visiting the island to survey the damage and playfully tossing paper towels into a crowd of residents. Harris said: “He abandoned the island, tried to block aid after back-to-back devastating hurricanes and offered nothing more than paper towels and insults.”\n\nBad Bunny also took up the issue of the Trump administration’s response to Hurricane Maria in one of his more recent songs, “Una Velita.”\n\nIn an interview Monday morning with Apple Music, Bad Bunny said he’s “always doing everything with purpose” and suggested that he uses his music to advocate for Puerto Rico and for his community. He also said he was still trying to figure out what he would do for the halftime show, which is being produced for the seventh time by Roc Nation, the entertainment and sports company founded by the billionaire rapper Jay-Z.\n\nThis also would be Bad Bunny’s second Super Bowl halftime show performance. He made a guest appearance at the Super Bowl LIV show in 2020, headlined by Jennifer Lopez and Shakira. Both singers congratulated Bad Bunny for being named the headliner for the upcoming show. “Welcome back to the Super Bowl stage! Here comes my Latin people!” Shakira wrote on Instagram.","summary":"The Puerto Rican-born singer and rapper has been critical of Trump's anti-immigration policy.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/29/bad-bunnys-super-bowl-gig-maga/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BadBunny.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-29 17:23:52","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.581},{"id":364566874,"title":"Krista Kafer: These top notch Republicans have a shot next year, let’s not spoil it with my endorsement","text":"As an unapologetic Trump critic and so-called RINO (Republican in Name Only), my endorsement could cost a good Republican candidate votes, so I don’t endorse good candidates.\n\nThus, I will not be endorsing the intelligent, hard-working State Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer for Colorado governor. Sensible, principled, and conservative but able to work across the aisle, Kirkmeyer is the best Republican candidate to run for governor in years.\n\nLikewise, I will not be endorsing the smart, affable, and fabulously mustached former president of the State Senate and current Fremont County Commissioner Kevin Grantham for state treasurer. Both of these candidates have solid platforms and neither one raves hysterically on social media, so do not look for my name on their list of endorsements. They have a chance in 2026, albeit a slim one, so I won’t risk it. Although Colorado is solidly blue, weakened support for Democrats and a softening economy may give these two Republicans the chance they need to take a statewide office.\n\nA recent Magellan Strategies poll finds that of those who voted for Kamala Harris last year, 47% now have an unfavorable view of the Democratic Party. The same poll shows 52% have an unfavorable opinion of Gov. Jared Polis’ job as governor. Forty-four percent disapprove of U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and 49% U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper. As a recent Denver Post editorial noted, “After years of enjoying popularity, Colorado’s top Democrats are now showing a remarkable drop in their approval ratings among voters.” Democrats cannot coast through the next election and a strong Republican may have a chance.\n\nGiven this possibility and the risks associated with a Kafer endorsement, I will not endorse the strongest candidates but the weakest for the position they are best suited.\n\nI endorse State Rep. Scott Bottoms, who is also running for governor, to play the next Church Lady on Saturday Night Live. Of all his colleagues, he most frequently mentions Satan on the dais. Comfortable as he is with calling everything socialist and Marxist, he could also play Sen. Joe McCarthy in a dramatization for the History Channel, if he shaved his beard that is. Bottoms is an election conspiracy theorist who plans to release former County Clerk Tina Peters from prison if elected. With the Magellan Strategies poll showing 59% disapproval of Trump, choosing a full tilt MAGA candidate is the best strategy for keeping Colorado solidly in the Democratic column.\n\nIf that’s the goal, State Sen. Mark Baisley, another gubernatorial candidate, would also fit the bill. He once blamed Antifa for the Jan. 6 insurrection and once wrote that having hit their “socialist stride” the Democratic Party’s ultimate goal was “Sharia.” Keep Colorado blue, vote Baisley!\n\nFor embodying the axiom “if at first you don’t succeed, try, try again” I endorse former U.S. Rep. Greg Lopez who has run for governor twice and lost twice in the primary. Go for three! Tied with Lopez for the “try, try again” distinction is former State Rep. Janak Joshi who plans to run against Sen. John Hickenlooper who never loses and could probably run from the grave and win. Unfortunately, a solid non-endorsable Republican candidate has not thrown a hat into this race.\n\nFinally, I could endorse Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell for governor, but I’ll need to Google his name and figure out where Teller County is.\n\nAll joking aside, it would be better for the party to run great candidates like Kirkmeyer and Grantham who can win not just Republican votes but bring along unaffiliated and even moderate Democrats. As elections in other blue states like Massachusetts and Maryland show, the right Republican candidate can win on occasion. To boost their chances, the candidates I have endorsed should drop out and direct their supporters and funders to a candidate who has a chance.\n\nKrista Kafer is a Sunday Denver Post columnist.\n\nSign up for Sound Off to get a weekly roundup of our columns, editorials and more. \n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by email or mail.","summary":"My endorsement could cost a good Republican candidate votes.

But in the months since 2024, a similar—albeit much quieter—form of election denial has emerged in parts of the progressive left.\n\nThese theories range from claims that Elon Musk used Starlink satellites to hack the election to a the quasi-mystical TikTok subculture known as the \"4 A.M. Club,\" whose members believe the timeline glitched and Kamala Harris won in a parallel reality. But the most prominent claims have been rooted in data-heavy spreadsheets and statistical jargon.\n\nOne of the most popular of these theories suggests that a 2024 National Security Agency audit confirmed that Kamala Harris won the election, a claim which gained notoriety after it appeared in This Will Hold, an anonymously published Substack. The post alleges that one of the audit's supposed participants, an ex-CIA officer named Adam Zarnowski, possessed insider information about a global cabal of corrupt actors, international criminals, foreign operatives, billionaires, and political insiders who conspired together to manipulate the election's outcome.\n\nAs The Atlantic recently reported, there is no independent verification of Zarnowski's background beyond his own claims. A LinkedIn profile describes him as a \"former CIA paramilitary operations officer\" but provides no evidence that he is an expert in election security or statistics. Snopes has been unable to \"independently verify Zarnowski's employment with the CIA or his alleged involvement in [the] NSA audit.\"\n\nThe Election Truth Alliance (ETA), a self-described nonpartisan watchdog group, has used statistical models to push claims that Harris won the election. In Rockland County, New York, for example, Harris received fewer votes for president than incumbent Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D–N.Y.) did for Senate. The ETA suggests that possible election tampering can be inferred from this discrepancy.\n\nBut Charles Stewart, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, points out that this apparent discrepancy isn't unusual and can easily be explained. Stewart attributes Harris' weaker performance to her unpopularity among the county's Orthodox Jewish voters relative to Gillibrand, as well as the broader trend of voters skipping races or voting split-ticket.\n\nThe organization's claims go further. In a recent interview with the progressive commentator David Pakman, the ETA's Nathan Taylor claimed that vote patterns in Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania illustrate a series of unusual relationships between candidate support and voter turnout. Using color-coded heat maps, Taylor asserts that his group has discovered statistical distortions similar to those seen in countries with a reputation for fraudulent election practices, such as Russia and Uganda. Using these maps, Taylor alleges that up to 190,000 votes cast in Pennsylvania may have been algorithmically shifted, which would be more than enough to flip the state.\n\nTo lend credibility to these claims, the ETA circulated a working paper by the University of Michigan political scientist Walter Mebane that used statistical techniques to examine Pennsylvania's 2024 election results. Mebane told The Atlantic that while he was aware the group had used his public methodology and data models, he had not reviewed their findings and did not endorse their conclusions. \n\nTo this day, no court case or credible audit has validated any of these claims. Independent experts have repeatedly affirmed that the 2024 election, like the 2020 election before it, was secure and legitimate. Jen Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told reporters in November 2024 that her office detected no threat that could \"materially impact\" the outcome, assuring everyone that \"our election infrastructure has never been more secure\" and that election officials were better prepared than ever to deliver a \"safe, secure, free, and fair\" process.\n\nAlthough this is hardly the first time that members of the left have questioned an election's outcome, political scientist Justin Grimmer told The Atlantic that this behavior is also \"strikingly similar\" to that of those on the right who rejected the 2020 election results. \"The most remarkable thing,\" he added, \"is the similarity in the analysis that we're seeing from the bad claims made after 2020 and these similarly bad, really poorly set up claims from 2024.\"\n\nDavid Becker of the Center for Election Innovation and Research put it more bluntly, telling the magazine that these claims \"ring as hollow and grifting as nearly identical claims made by those who profited off the Big Lie that Trump didn't lose the 2020 election.\"","summary":"Echoes of Trump's 2020 delusions are reborn in blue.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/09/29/the-conspiracy-theorists-who-claim-kamala-harris-really-won-in-2024/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/09/Stopthesteal-3.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-29 14:40:33","author":"Jacob R.

I have one very genuine question: it’s been 250 days. now that immigrants have been violently torn from their families and communities have been destroyed, now that trans people have been blamed for virtually everything and live in fear, now that free speech is on the brink of collapse for us all — has your life gotten better?” the message read.\n\nThe post continued: “Have your groceries gotten cheaper? Has your health insurance premium gone down? Has your work/life balance improved? Can you take a vacation yet? Are you happier? Has the widespread suffering of others paid off for you in the way he promised it would, or are you still waiting?”\n\nGrande’s political post sparked backlash on X.\n\n“Well ignorance is bliss in the little world of the wealthy,” one Trump supporter tweeted.\n\n“The suffering you refer to is a perception.

Has your health insurance premium gone down? Has your work/life balance improved?” he continued.\n\n“Can you take a vacation yet? Are you happier? Has the widespread suffering of others paid off for you in the way he promised it would, or are you still waiting?”\n\nGrande, 32, did not include any additional commentary in her repost on Saturday.\n\nThe Grammy winner made it clear in November 2024 that she voted for Kamala Harris, letting her Instagram followers know on Election Day that she submitted her Florida ballot early.\n\nWhen Trump, 79, defeated Harris, 60, Grande shared a message of support for those “feeling the immeasurable heaviness of this outcome today.”\n\nThe “Wicked” star went on to share resources for LGBTQ+ fans.\n\nThe actress shared a similar sentiment when Hillary Clinton lost the presidency to Trump in 2016 while predicting “a very dark few years” would follow.\n\n“Let’s please be active and vocal every day toward making each other feel accepted and loved for our differences. not just on election day. please,” she wrote. “it’s the only way we will be able to get through.”\n\nTwo years later, she subtly dissed the “Apprentice” alum in her “Thank U, Next” music video by reading an “Immigration and Refugee Law and Policy” book.\n\nThe songwriter’s mom, Joan Grande, confirmed via X that this was a dig at Trump and called Ariana a “passionate advocate for humanity.”\n\nWhen Carrie Underwood performed at Trump’s inauguration, Ariana “liked” a shady post quipping that the “American Idol” alum, 42, struggled to “find the note.”\n\nThat same month, Ariana reposted another of Bernstein’s uploads when Trump signed an executive order recognizing only “two sexes, male and female.”\n\nThe post read, “okay, sure, whatever you say. but let’s be very clear: queer and trans people were here before donald trump and will continue to be here after he’s dead. whether or not you want us to exist is secondary to the simple fact that we do.”\n\nBernstein concluded, “the sun does not care if you sign an executive order telling it to stop rising each morning. it just continues to rise.”\n\nAriana’s brother, Frankie Grande, is gay, and the singer wrote about the 42-year-old’s sexuality in a 2018 “love letter to the LGBTQ community.”\n\n“I can’t remember a difference between Frankie before he came out and Frankie after he came out.

She reposted a message on her social media, directed towards Donald Trump’s supporters. The message questions the voters about whether the POTUS truly managed to keep the economic pledges he made during his election campaign last year. In addition, it also asks whether the economic results delivered by the administration outweigh their many controversial policies on social and civil rights.\n\nIn particular, the message shared by Grande questions Trump’s pre-election promises to reduce health insurance premiums and grocery prices. The post that she shared says, “It’s been 250 days. now that immigrants have been violently torn from their families and communities have been destroyed, now that free speech is on the brink of collapse for us all – has your life gotten better?”\n\nIt continues, “Have your groceries gotten cheaper? Has your health insurance premium gone down? Has your work/life balance improved? Can you take a vacation yet? Are you happier?”\n\nThe social media message ends with one burning question, “Has the widespread suffering of others paid off for you in the way he promised he would, or are you still waiting?”\n\nAfter Ariana Grande reposted this on her Instagram story, it quickly went viral. On X (formerly Twitter), many people flocked to praise her bold stance against the Trump administration.\n\n“Thank you Ariana Grande,” wrote one user, while the other added, “I love this women with every fiber in me!” A third pointed out that this proves she definitely did not vote for the President.\n\nNotably, this is not the first time Ariana has publicly criticized Donald Trump. A few months earlier, she reposted one similar message amid the immigration crackdown chaos. The photo, which she shared, showed a placard that read, “Could someone explain which crimes get you deported and which ones get you elected President? It’s so confusing.” It refers to the felony charges against Trump.\n\nThen last October, while hosting Saturday Night Live, she shared yet another political remark that raised eyebrows. The pop star said, “he last time I hosted was in 2016 and we were right on the verge of electing our first female president.” Grande added, “So I guess, second time’s a charm.”\n\nHowever, when Trump ultimately beat Kamala Harris, she also took to her social media to voice her opinions on the win. “Holding the hand of every person who is feeling the immeasurable heaviness of this outcome today,” Ariana wrote on Instagram.","summary":"Ariana Grande shared a social media message for Trump supporters.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/furious-ariana-grande-has-a-few-questions-for-trump-supporters","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design-2025-09-29T173818.453.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-29 14:04:08","author":"Moupriya,Wikimedia Commons/michael Vadon/barbie Simons","authors":["Moupriya","Wikimedia Commons/michael Vadon/barbie Simons"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.052},{"id":364530936,"title":"CNN Host Takes Aim at Donald Trump in Blistering Debate on Healthcare","text":"CNN host Jake Tapper appeared visibly tense during an interview with House Speaker Mike Johnson, as the U.S. faces an imminent government shutdown unless Congress passes a funding agreement by October 1. The tension came after Donald Trump cancelled a meeting with Democratic leaders Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer. Still, he’s planning to meet with top congressional leaders to work out a deal. However, he has reportedly agreed to meet with top congressional figures in a last-minute attempt to prevent the shutdown.\n\nAccording to the Irish Star, during the interview, Tapper questioned whether Trump is genuinely open to compromise. He pointedly asked, “At this meeting tomorrow, is President Trump looking to make a deal, or is it going to be like when Michael Corleone met Senator Geary, ‘My offer is this: nothing’?”\n\nMike Johnson defended Trump, saying he wants to help and is concerned about a shutdown’s impact on military pay, healthcare access, and aid programs. He also blamed Democrats, just like President Trump, for extra expenditure on policies like healthcare for undocumented immigrants, which Republicans strongly oppose.\n\nLater, Jake Tapper countered, playing a clip of Hakeem Jeffries (House Minority Leader and Leader of the House Democratic Caucus since 2023) defending the Democrats’ position on healthcare. Jeffries asserted that Democrats were merely asking for a continuation of Obamacare subsidies.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Obamacare subsidies are a funding aid from the U.S. government that lowers the cost of health insurance for people who buy it through the Affordable Care Act (ACA). People with low to moderate income thresholds can apply for aid and receive reductions in their monthly insurance costs. Consequently, Mike Johnson called Hakeem Jeffries’s claims “absurd.”\n\nHe slammed the Democrats for allegedly trying to push unrelated demands, which include healthcare for undocumented immigrants and cuts to rural hospitals.\n\nThese tensions regarding extreme views of how Democrats and Republicans view the notion of healthcare have stemmed from their age-old thought processes and political ideologies. Previously, a new Gallup and West Health poll shows that most Americans (67%) feel healthcare isn’t getting enough attention in the 2024 presidential campaign. \n\nWhile Trump did defeat Kamala Harris and became the 47th president in 2025, people believed that Kamala Harris had a better vision and goal for improving the healthcare system in America than Trump and his administration (via news.gallup). \n\nThe Democrats focused more on improving access to care and mental health, and continuing Obamacare subsidies, while the Republicans focused more on reducing government spending and taking strict measures against the healthcare of illegal immigrants. Furthermore, the Independents also hold similar views to Democrats regarding the future of healthcare in America. \n\nLastly, coming back to CNN host Jake Tapper, he has been a longtime critic of Trump, just like many others! Hence, his attempts to ridicule POTUS’s every move don’t come as a shock.","summary":"Anchor Jake Tapper grilled Mike Johnson on Trump's healthcare stance in a brief interview!

Earlier this month, Bad Bunny shared why he chose not to include any stops in the United States during his upcoming tour that begins in November. The 31-year-old was asked by i-D magazine if his decision had anything to do with the deportations of illegals in the U.S., which is when he shared his thoughts on ICE. \"Man, honestly, yes,\" he replied. \"There were many reasons why I didn’t show up in the U.S., and none of them were out of hate —I’ve performed there many times.

I have one very genuine question,” she said in an Instagram story re-posted from podcaster Matt Bernstein’s account.\n\n“It's been 250 days.

She wrote that then-President Joe Biden’s initial desire to run for reelection was “recklessness,” that Gov. Gavin Newsom ignored her after Biden dropped from the campaign and that Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was too ambitious to trust as a running mate.\n\nIn typical Harris fashion, she’s now doing damage control.\n\nHarris considered a run for California governor in 2026 and passed and appears now to be considering another run for president in 2028 – though she repeatedly told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow this week that running for president is “not my focus” – which is usually code for “it’s all I think about.”\n\nIt seems Harris has learned nothing since her election loss to Donald Trump in 2024 and nothing from four years prior when she flamed out of the Democratic primary. Supporters, including former President Barack Obama, have blamed her loss on sexism and racism.\n\nIt has never been a particularly strong accusation, considering Obama, a black man, was overwhelmingly elected president twice and Harris, a woman of Jamaican and Indian descent, had been elected vice president once. It betrays a simpler and more obvious explanation that Harris was a weak candidate and VP to an unpopular president.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Harris. In the book, Harris argues that she really wanted to choose then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who is gay, as her running mate, but felt that the country wasn’t ready for all those firsts.\n\n“He would have been an ideal partner – if I were a straight white man,” Harris writes. “But we were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man.”\n\nInstead, she made the allegedly safe choice in Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who brought little to the ticket except lively jazz hands, because she was convinced she needed a white guy with regional balance. Wrong again.\n\nHarris’s unwillingness to look in the mirror and acknowledge her own faults is standing in her way electorally more than any perceived racism or sexism ever will.\n\nIn fact, CNN’s data guru Harry Enten cited polling this week showing that Harris’s favorability is -13 points in September 2025, compared to just -5 points a few weeks before the election, showing that she’s less popular now that she’s been on the road trying to set the record straight.\n\nAnd what setting the record straight it’s been! Harris was asked on The View about a disastrous answer she gave during the campaign that “nothing comes to mind” as to what she would have done differently from Biden – at a time when around only 40 percent of the country approved of Biden’s job performance.\n\nInstead of giving a substantive answer, or acknowledging any sort of remorse, Harris said she failed to “appreciate how much people wanted to know there was a difference.” In other words, she had no idea what the election was about and was entirely out of touch with the electorate – as she still seems to be.\n\nHarris was routinely criticized for her inability to answer hard questions, or even easy questions, and instead dishing up heaping plates of word salad. Again, nothing has changed.\n\nTo ABC’s Michael Strahan this week, who asked if Biden would have been capable of serving a second term, Harris dodged the question and instead offered a tortured explanation of how she had concerns about his ability to handle a presidential campaign, but not so much with governing.\n\n“My concern about his running for reelection was completely separate from my admiration and knowledge about his capacity to serve as President of the United States, which was consistent and never wavered,” Harris said.\n\nSee what she did there?\n\nIt’s all so strange anyway. It’s obvious now, even more so than it was at the time, that Biden was unfit to serve another term. Sure, Harris is right that presidential campaigns are grueling and a feeble, elderly man was not up to the task. But it’s insane to think that four years as president would somehow be less grueling – presidents age in dog years for a reason.\n\nHarris says only now does she realize voters wanted change. That’s incredible. Unbelievable, even.\n\nHarris is right that she was dealt a bad hand. Fairly or unfairly, she was saddled with Biden’s baggage (though she often took partial credit for the Administration’s actions) and she didn’t get much time to run a campaign.\n\nIt’s possible, likely even, that no other Democrat would have won under those conditions. But it’s also hard to imagine anyone doing worse.\n\nUnless she takes a serious look at herself and adjusts accordingly, it’s unlikely a third time will be a charm.\n\nMatt Fleming is an opinion columnist for the Southern California News Group.

The entire complaint, which is more akin to a manifesto than a formal legal document, is presented in a single paragraph. \n\nHe has named Trump, the Federal Reserve, the National Security Agency, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the State of Israel, Elon Musk’s X-Corp, T-Mobile, and Warner Bros. Studios in court documents. \n\nIn the lengthy complaint, Chansley states that he is the “true” American president and that America should only have two laws: the Bill of Rights and the original U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe QAnon shaman would also print a one-ounce gold coin, valued at $40 trillion, to pay off the country’s debts. \n\nBizarrely, one section in the lawsuit suggests that plots for Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight and James Cameron’s Avatar were plagiarized from his own writing. \n\nAlso, Chansley has alleged that the National Security Agency catfished him as Michele Rodriguez, to persuade him to use his “shamanic” abilities to deal with “other-worldly matters.”\n\nHe also claims that Donald Trump personally emailed him just two days after the Capitol Riots in 2021. \n\nTrump has recently blamed the FBI for inciting the Capitol riot, claiming that there were 274 federal agents hidden in the crowds on January 6. \n\nHowever, the Department of Justice confirmed that the agents sent to the Capitol had been ordered to investigate reports of pipe bombs and to prevent Trump loyalists from interrupting the peaceful transfer of power to the then-president-elect Joe Biden.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won 306 electoral votes alongside his running mate Kamala Harris. Meanwhile, Trump won just 232 electoral votes, as well as 7,059,526 fewer votes than his rival. \n\nFollowing the election, Trump claimed that he would “never concede” the race to his opponent.\n\n“Get smart Republicans. FIGHT,” he tweeted on the morning of the riots. \n\nDuring his speech on the same day, his supporters could be heard shouting “invade the Capitol”, “fight for Trump,” and “take the Capitol.”\n\nThe QAnon Shaman, Jacob Chansley, was convicted of obstructing an official proceeding because of his role in the riots. \n\nHe was later pardoned by Trump, alongside 1,500 other individuals, in January 2025 for his crime. \n\nChansley takes his nickname from QAnon, the far-right conspiracy theory movement that claims that Donald Trump is leading a fight against a secret sex-trafficking ring led by a global elite cabal. \n\nHowever, Chansley rescinded his support for Trump because the president refused to release the Epstein files. \n\nThe Independent has contacted The White House, the Federal Reserve, the National Security Agency, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Israeli government, Elon Musk’s X-Corp, T-Mobile, and Warner Bros.

Gavin Newsom has taken a decided lurch to the left, enlisting progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to help him pass Proposition 50, the controversial redistricting measure.\n\nIndeed, Newsom recently shared an ad featuring the star progressive congresswoman, urging Californians to vote for Prop. 50 as a way to “stop” President Donald Trump. There is also a similar Spanish-language ad aimed at California’s large Hispanic population.\n\nTo be sure, AOC has long sought to raise her national profile, but campaigning for a ballot measure 3,000 miles away from her New York district suggests that both sides hope to benefit.\n\nFor Newsom, he clearly believes that in order to win – and position himself as Democrats’ leader ahead of his own 2028 presidential bid – he must court progressives.\n\nAnd for her part, as Axios reported, AOC’s appearance in the middle of a California ballot measure debate comes as her team is preparing a 2028 run for either the White House or the Senate.\n\nWhile California’s deep-blue electorate is probably more receptive to AOC than most other states, Newsom’s strategy of courting the far-left carries significant risks, both for this vote and for his longer term viability in a presidential general election.\n\nMoreover, by nationalizing the fight over Prop. 50, should it not pass, Newsom runs the tremendous risk of turning a local defeat into a national embarrassment. \n\nTo that point, despite AOC’s high favorability among Democrats – two-thirds (65%) have a favorable view of her, per Economist/YouGov – she is a liability for Newsom among Independents.\n\nJust 3-in-10 (31%) of this critical voting bloc have a favorable view of AOC in the same poll, while nationally, she is 6-points underwater (34% favorable vs. 40% unfavorable).\n\nAt the same time, AOC is capable of rallying California’s younger, progressive voters, which Newsom needs if he wants to have any chance of winning the special election. \n\nAnd, having staked his reputation – and leadership role within the Democratic party – on passing the ballot measure, polling data reinforces that Newsom is left with few options.\n\nAccording to an Emerson College survey, among California voters, the slimmest of majorities (50.6%) say they plan to vote for Proposition 50, while 49% plan to either oppose it (34%) or are undecided (15%).\n\nThose findings – razor thin margins for Newsom – dovetail with other public polls, such as this from UC Berkeley, which showed 48% of Californians planning to vote yes, with a majority (52%) either opposed (32%) or unsure (20%). \n\nHowever, a closer look at the data underscores the role Newsom hopes progressives will play.\n\nIn the Emerson survey, support for Prop. 50 is highest among young, college educated Democrats – the core of the progressive wing.\n\nSimilarly, the UC Berkeley poll shows that three-quarters (76%) of voters who identify as “strongly liberal” back Newsom’s effort, more than 30-points higher than moderates (42%).\n\nTaken together, Newsom’s steps to enlist AOC reflect the growing importance and power of the progressive faction of a Democratic Party still struggling to find its way.\n\nIn turn, as progressives become even more important for Democratic candidates, the party as a whole, but particularly Newsom, are playing a risky game. \n\nAs the 2024 election strongly indicated, Democrats alienated a sizable share of the electorate with their recent move to the left. \n\nNot only did Donald Trump win a second term, but Republicans also took both chambers of Congress and the national conversation has turned into criticism or, outside of the major cities, outright rejection of progressive positions. \n\nCalifornia is no exception.\n\nDespite Newsom’s massive ad blitz and money advantage – he alone has raised $70 million – voters remain skeptical of abolishing the independent commission that currently draws the state’s congressional districts. \n\nIn that same vein, Donald Trump did considerably better in California in 2024 compared to his own past, as well as previous GOP candidates. \n\nTrump flipped 10 counties in the Golden State, and increased his vote share in 45, while former VP Kamala Harris – the hometown candidate – won almost 2 million votes fewer than former President Biden won in 2020.\n\nFurther, a number of state and local elections in California have shown that, while in no way a purple state, opposition to progressive politics is solid. \n\nUltimately, with midterms tending to have lower turnout than presidential elections, Newsom and AOC may be able to bring out enough young progressives to pass partisan redistricting. \n\nAnd yet, with Newsom openly depending on the progressive wing of his party, he is opening himself up to considerable risks and potential vulnerabilities down the road. \n\nSpecifically, Newsom must now try to balance appealing to this ever-more critical voting bloc, while positioning himself as a moderate if he hopes to have any shot at winning a general election for president.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political

They met in mid-September to reevaluate the hepatitis B recommendations. However, the committee postponed its vote indefinitely following several hours of intense debate and sharp disagreement.\n\nAny changes in recommendations for the childhood vaccine schedule made by the ACIP and subsequently approved by the CDC director, including the infant dose of the hepatitis B vaccine, will alter insurance coverage through private and public plans.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson told the Washington Examiner that “it has not been determined yet” whether hepatitis B will be discussed at the next ACIP meeting, which is currently scheduled for late October.\n\nMeanwhile, the leader of the GOP has weighed in squarely against vaccinating newborns for hepatitis B.\n\nDuring a press event on the causes of autism on Monday, President Donald Trump praised ACIP’s re-evaluation of the hepatitis B vaccine and told parents to wait to vaccinate their child against hepatitis B.\n\n“Hepatitis B is sexually transmitted. There’s no reason to give a baby that’s almost just born hepatitis B,” Trump said Monday.\n\nTrump reiterated the point Friday morning, posting on Truth Social that children should “TAKE HEPATITAS B SHOT AT 12 YEARS OLD, OR OLDER, AND, IMPORTANTLY, TAKE VACCINE IN 5 SEPARATE MEDICAL VISITS.”\n\nInfants most at risk for developing chronic hepatitis B\n\nBodily fluids exchanged from a hepatitis B-positive mother to her child during labor and delivery are a primary vehicle for children to be infected with the virus. Infants born to mothers who are hepatitis B-positive are most at risk for developing chronic hepatitis B. \n\nWhile only 2% to 6% of adults who contract acute hepatitis B will go on to develop a chronic infection, 90% of infants who contract the disease will have the disease their entire lives. About a quarter of those who contract chronic hepatitis B at birth will die from liver damage or liver cancer, according to the CDC. \n\nAbout 70% of the estimated 1.89 million people in the United States living with chronic hepatitis B were born overseas, mostly in Asia and Africa. Still, an estimated 25,000 infants are born to hepatitis B-positive mothers each year in the U.S. \n\nAlthough those most at risk for contracting acute hepatitis B are those who use intravenous drugs and homosexual males, the disease can also be spread through more casual contact, including through seemingly innocuous objects, such as shared toothbrushes and piercing or tattooing needles. \n\nSen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), chairman of the Senate health committee, has been one of the most vocal supporters of the universal infant dose of the hepatitis B vaccine because of his experience as a gastroenterologist specializing in liver disease.\n\nDuring the height of the AIDS epidemic, Cassidy started a hepatitis B vaccination program for low-income patients at the facility he co-founded, the Greater Baton Rouge Community Clinic in Louisiana, which has highly influenced his position on the vaccine.\n\nEarlier this month, Cassidy posted on X pictures of patients with cirrhosis from liver disease, saying that the hepatitis B shot is “about preventing illnesses like this.” \n\n“I have the experience of treating patients infected with hepatitis B at birth, who end up terribly ill like this,” said Cassidy. “Why would anyone want someone to end up like this?\n\nMAHA pushes skepticism of Hepatitis B vaccine \n\nSeveral leading Republicans in the MAHA movement have questioned the need for vaccinating all infants on their first day of life and instead have suggested that only those born to hepatitis B-positive mothers should be vaccinated and treated within 24 hours of birth. \n\nSen. Roger Marshall (R-KS) has championed this position, citing his 25 years as an OB-GYN physician. \n\nMarshall told CNN’s Jake Tapper earlier this month that testing for hepatitis is part of routine prenatal care and that physicians ought to get to know whether their patient has risk factors for the disease.\n\n“There are people that need the Hepatitis vaccine. I’m just saying, not a one-day-old, and not every baby does,” Marshall said. If we don’t know the Hepatitis status of the mom, if it’s a patient that hasn’t got prenatal care, it’s a person that’s doing drugs, of course, that baby needs the Hepatitis vaccine.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-KY), an ophthalmologist who earned his medical degree from Duke University, has also been an outspoken critic of the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns, arguing since at least 2015 that infants need not be inoculated against a sexually transmitted infection.\n\nOver Labor Day weekend, Paul and Cassidy engaged in a heated back-and-forth on X regarding whether the vaccine is necessary if a mother delivering in the hospital tests negative. \n\nPaul posted during the debate that the “only logical reason moms would not be tested is malpractice” if they were to deliver in a hospital setting, adding that Cassidy “seems to claim the doctors are incompetent to do Hep B testing of moms, but perfectly able to perform universal vaccination.”\n\nVaccinating newborns for an STI\n\nTrump, Paul, and other detractors of the infant hepatitis B vaccine argue that it is not necessary to vaccinate newborns for a sexually transmitted infection, appealing to common sense. \n\nThis isn’t new. Critics of the hepatitis B vaccine have made similar points since the CDC recommended universal vaccination in the early 1990s, when most states required the inoculation for children to attend daycare or school.\n\nElena Conis, professor of journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, and historian on the portrayal of vaccines in the media, contends that this line of critique was at least in part influenced by the role of media coverage of the hepatitis B vaccine in the 1980s at the peak of the AIDS crisis. \n\nThe first iteration of the vaccine went to market in 1981, and an even safer version was released in 1986, making it possible for the first time to start a mass vaccination campaign against hepatitis B. \n\nJournalists and scientists in the late 1980s, attempting to raise public awareness, emphasized how those most at risk for hepatitis B, homosexual men and intravenous drug users, were the same as those most at risk for contracting HIV. \n\nMedia reports highlighted the hepatitis B vaccine as a “beacon of hope in a time of fear,” Conis argued in her 2011 paper on the history of the hepatitis B vaccine. This style of reporting eventually created the perception among non-medical professionals that hepatitis B is primarily an STI.\n\nBut by the early 1990s, the CDC recognized that it was practically impossible to target adults most at risk of contracting hepatitis B before they had been exposed to the virus. Their solution, outlined in a 1991 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, was to vaccinate all newborns, regardless of maternal hepatitis B status. \n\nCases of hepatitis B have precipitously dropped since the start of the universal vaccination policy. Still, Conis argues the association between hepatitis B and HIV stuck in the public consciousness and ultimately heightened skepticism of the vaccine among parents.\n\n“Critics looked to early scientific representations of hepatitis B as a sexually-transmitted disease affecting specific strata of the adult population as evidence in support of their position,” wrote Conis.\n\nGOP supporters of Hepatitis B vaccine raise alarm bells \n\nAlthough Cassidy has been the loudest proponent of the infant hepatitis B vaccine, other Republicans in the Senate have expressed frustration with Kennedy and Trump’s direction on vaccine policy, including hepatitis B.\n\nMajority Whip John Barrasso (R-WY), an orthopedic surgeon by training, has said that he has become “increasingly concerned” about Kennedy’s leadership on vaccines since the measles outbreak in West Texas earlier this year, which claimed the lives of two children in an undervaccinated Mennonite community. \n\nBarrasso told Kennedy that “vaccines work” during a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee the week before the ACIP meeting.\n\n“I’ve been hearing from many of my medical colleagues, people I know from medical school residency and when I practice medicine in Wyoming, and their real concerns that safe, proven vaccines like measles and hepatitis B and others could be in jeopardy, and that would put Americans at risk and reverse decades of progress,” Barrasso said.\n\nBarrasso’s office declined to provide updated comments since his statements earlier this month, in light of the delayed decision from ACIP and Trump’s recommendation to delay the shot until puberty. \n\nSens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), both senior members of the Senate health committee, have also said that they are concerned by Trump’s remarks on vaccine policy and his recommendation that pregnant women not take Tylenol due to potential autism risks. \n\nHepatitis B vaccine uptake still relatively high\n\nRegardless of the controversy surrounding the infant dose of the Hepatitis B vaccine, comparatively few parents are choosing to skip or delay the inoculation.\n\nAccording to a sweeping survey on vaccine policy from KFF and the Washington Post earlier this month, only about 16% of parents have delayed or skipped some childhood vaccines, excluding seasonal ones such as the flu and COVID vaccines.\n\nRoughly two in 10 Republican parents say they have skipped or delayed recommended childhood vaccines. That increases to approximately a quarter of MAGA-identified Republicans and only 17% of non-MAGA supporters. \n\nBut only a small percentage of parents, regardless of political affiliation, are declining the Hepatitis B vaccine despite the controversy. Only 5% of parents told KFF that they entirely skipped the Hepatitis B shot, while only 4% said they delayed the vaccination. \n\nParents who identified as MAGA Republicans were more likely to say they have skipped or delayed the Hepatitis B vaccine compared to non-MAGA parents, at 16% and 9% respectively.\n\nIssue polling data released in early September from Fabrizio Ward, a pollster heralded by Trump in the past, indicates that support for the Hepatitis B vaccine has overwhelming bipartisan support. \n\nRoughly 69% of Trump 2024 voters indicated that it was important to receive the Hepatitis B vaccine, compared to 79% of swing voters and 90% of those who voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.","summary":"The question of whether parents should vaccinate their newborns against hepatitis B is threatening to split the Republican Party between traditional conservatives and the Make America Healthy Again contingent.   The hepatitis B vaccine has been a touchstone for the anti-vaccine movement since the universal birth dose of the vaccine was recommended in 1991, but [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/3826887/gop-nears-schism-over-hepatitis-b-vaccinations/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-collage-2j3zmm38o-1758914195467.jpg?1758922323&#038;w=696","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-29 12:00:00","author":"Gabrielle M.

The public settling of scores between the media elite, the Harris coterie and Joe Biden’s courtiers has crowded out a sober assessment of why Trump won. The latest instalment in this parochial finger-pointing is Kamala Harris’s 304-page excuse for why she lost. \n\nYou don’t even have to open the book to know what those 304 pages contain. The title, 107 Days, sums up her entire argument: I didn’t have enough time. As she puts it, Biden’s “reckless” stubbornness meant he stepped aside too late for Harris to mount a winning campaign. The canker in her not-guilty plea is that the book itself contains copious evidence that the more time voters had to get to know her, the worse she fared.\n\nThe flashing lights began on the first day of her campaign. The evening after Biden dropped out, Charli XCX had posted “Kamala IS brat” on X, and in a portentous sign she couldn’t resist celebrities, the Harris campaign quickly swathed their social accounts in Brat green. Hours earlier she had rung Bernie Sanders to ask for his endorsement. He told her, according to her notes from the time, to focus on the working class, not just abortion. Harris did not heed that advice.\n\nThere were other bad omens. She recalls that, at one of her rallies, protesters started shouting “Kamala, Kamala, you can’t hide. We won’t vote for genocide”. Harris writes that the protesters’ threat to withhold their vote was “reckless” – there’s that chastisement of others again – because “either Trump or I would be elected”. Yes, voters faced a choice between her and Trump. But the corollary here is that Harris thought people should vote for her whatever she promised. In other words, she deserved their vote simply by not being Trump. No wonder she didn’t feel the need to offer much more than symbolism. \n\nThis contempt for democracy found its voice in the campaign’s aesthetics. For 107 days, Harris confused courting celebrities with winning votes. She name-drops the stars who joined her on the campaign trail with abandon: Stevie Wonder; Flo Milli; Cardi B; Keegan-Michael Key; Spike Lee; Jon Bon Jovi; the cast of Saturday Night Live; rapper Fat Joe. Here is a representative sentence: “We left as Katy Perry took the stage and arrived at our last rally in Philadelphia as Lady Gaga sat down at her piano to sing ‘God Bless America’.” She was very proud of the fact an SNL producer told her that she got some of the loudest applause he’d ever heard. Even her campaign chief of staff had once worked for Bono on solving poverty in Africa.\n\nThe book is one long cast list for a film with Harris as the star. This is politics as celebrity, not policy. It eerily suggests that Harris thinks the process by which America decides who wields power is little more than a Hollywood performance. There’s Kamala dancing on stage with Usher; here’s her pretending to knock on doors which have already been vetted by the Secret Service. She and Trump put on different shows. Trump just happened to sell more tickets.\n\nNone of this is helped by the fact the blurb uses the second person as if the election was a draft script for the Bourne Identity. “Your secret Service code name is Pioneer,” it reads. “On July 21, 2024, your running mate, Joe Biden announces that he will not be seeking reelection”. This is where it resembles a more lackadaisical version of Mission Impossible: “You have 107 days”. \n\nThe surreal tone, and the unwillingness to ponder what the voters actually wanted – except as monolithic categories such as black women – is so vast that it becomes clear her only aim is to defend her reputation, not reflect on the consequences of her and Biden’s cowardice and solipsism. Or perhaps this is just how she sees politics. Harris is an erstwhile lawyer. Lawyers are trained to administer the fair application of rules. It makes sense, then, that those lawyers who become politicians are not that interested in what those rules actually are, ie the moral and ideological content of politics itself. She reminds me of an ebullient Keir Starmer with a Californian twang and bouncier hair. \n\nAnother shared trait between these pilloried politicians might be that both think a qualification for high office is to be a “nice” person. Harris periodically reminds the reader that she treats her social inferiors with respect. She would speak to hotel staff on the campaign to “let them know they were appreciated”. As she walked up the cabin on Air Force Two each day, she would high-five the head of her Secret Service detail. I welcome friendly politicians. But friendliness alone is not a reason to make someone the most powerful person in the world.\n\nHarris’s belief in the importance of being nice is perhaps why she is so blind to corporate power. She boasts about cruising around with the billionaire Mark Cuban, for instance, but forgets to explain why she entertained firing the antitrust Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan after Cuban attacked her for blocking tech mergers. Antitrust was one of the few success stories she could have exploited to counter Trump’s faux economic populism. Instead, she offered something called the “opportunity economy”. \n\nHarris is in many ways the embodiment of woke capitalism, which one might define as the use of social and ethnic positive discrimination in order to sanitise economic inequality. She admits that she was only vice president because Jim Clyburn, the chair of the black caucus who tilted the primary for Biden, wanted Biden to pick a black woman as his running mate. And she was only the nominee because she was vice president. \n\nTrump and his supporters are fringe characters in her narrative. She is incurious about the populist age in which we live. Change the names and the narrative could have slotted into any campaign in the past 50 years. All she can muster is a glib paragraph about misinformation at the end of the book. Having offered this contentless, self-exculpating analysis, she concludes that politics is so broken that she no longer thinks working inside the system can solve anything. That’s probably an affectation. But her refusal to investigate why the system is so broken is the natural outcome of her studied vacuity.\n\nThe book’s conceit is that the Democratic Party had 107 days to stop Trump, and not a decade or two. Any politician who thinks this is true is probably more interested in excusing themselves from the consequences of the loss. The entire premise of the book is a revealing self-deception: that Washington’s personality politics is what determines elections – never mind the economy or, for that matter, the voters.","summary":"Harris’s new book, 107 Days, shows a lack of curiosity about what voters want","url":"https://www.newstatesman.com/international-politics/2025/09/kamala-harris-cares-too-much-about-being-nice","image":"https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/09/29/Kamalaweb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-29 11:11:57","author":"Freddie Hayward","authors":["Freddie Hayward"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.211},{"id":364555450,"title":"Bad Bunny en el Super Bowl: Marketing Brillante, Malísima Selección","text":"La NFL anunció que el espectáculo de medio tiempo del Super Bowl LX estará encabezado por nada menos que Bad Bunny. Estamos aquí para contarte el porqué, así como lo que los medios no te dirán mientras se esfuerzan por cubrir la noticia.\n\nEl por qué es bastante simple: la liga se está expandiendo a Latinoamérica y más allá, y Bad Bunny es una auténtica superestrella mundial. Con miles de millones de descargas en su haber y una creciente presencia en el mainstream, su contratación, seis años después de aparecer en el espectáculo de medio tiempo de Shakira y J-Lo, fue una obviedad. Al menos en teoría.\n\nA primera vista, parece que la NFL contrató a Bad Bunny sin apenas investigarlo más allá de su éxito musical. Es mucho más probable que, de hecho, lo investigaran a fondo antes de contratarlo deliberadamente, lo que demuestra que la liga sigue sumida en el virus del wokismo.\n\nEl apoyo de Bad Bunny a Kamala Harris en las elecciones presidenciales de 2024 (aunque no compuso nada en Pensilvania ni en otros estados clave con una importante población hispana) demuestra que es una figura políticamente divisiva. Aboga por la independencia de Puerto Rico y su separación total de Estados Unidos- una posición favorecida tan sólo por el 12% de la población de la isla, mientras se retira a las comodidades de mansiones de lujo en Hollywood y otros lugares.\n\nLuego está el asunto de la hipocresía de Bad Bunny al cantar en el Super Bowl después de supuestamente negarse a realizar una gira en los Estados Unidos continentales debido a las redadas de ICE, que supuestamente lo obligaron a hacer una residencia de 30 fechas en Puerto Rico. narrativa que los medios promovieron a lo papagayo. Para empezar, el ICE tiene presencia activa en Puerto Rico y ha realizado redadas de acuerdo con la política migratoria vigente. Luego está el asunto de la residencia en sí. Según varios informes, la residencia fue reservada en 2023- cuando Joe Biden permitía que inmigrantes ilegales inundaran la frontera sur que se viera ni un solo agente de ICE. Lo que siguió fue una brillante estrategia de marketing destinada a asegurar un Choliseo lleno, ahorrando en viajes y logística, y sobre todo evitando la vergüenza de tener que cancelar conciertos debido a las bajas ventas en ciudades como Minneapolis.\n\nLingüísticamente, esta podría ser un show muy interesante. El Super Bowl LX se transmitirá por NBC y Telemundo, cadenas hermanas de Comcast. Mientras que NBC probablemente dejará que los balidos obscenos de Bad Bunny corran inéditos con el subtítulo de \"Singing in non-English\", los censores de Telemundo tendrán que ponerse las pilas. Consideren una minúscula muestra de las letras de Bad Bunny en, por ejemplo, Safaera (FUERTE AVISO):\n\nMi bicho anda fugao’ y yo quiero que tu me lo esconda’/ Agárralo como bonga/ Se metió una pepa que la pone cachonda/ Chinga en lo’ Audi, no en lo’ Honda/ Ey, si te lo meto no me llame’/ Que esto no es pa’ que me ame’ ey/ Si tu novio no te mama el culo/ Pa’ eso que no mame\n\nY en Baticano:\n\nLa noche se puso kinky/ Tre' dedo' en el toto, en el culo, el pinky/ La' moña' violeta como Inky Winky/ Una nalgada y la dejo como Po, ey/ Le doy por donde hace pipí, por donde hace popó\n\nLo peor de todo es que esta actuación será aclamada como una prueba evidente de que la diversidad es nuestra mayor fortaleza y como un triunfo de la cultura latina. En ambos casos, un no rotundo.\n\nLa actuación de Bad Bunny en el Super Bowl no es un triunfo de los valores tradicionales de \"Dios, patria y familia\" que los hispanos han defendido durante siglos y que trajeron a Estados Unidos desde antes de la Guerra de la Independencia. Sin embargo,es un apoteosis para una identidad latina, artificial y política, que busca perpetuar una subclase extranjera permanente, separada para siempre y ajena a la corriente principal de la cultura estadounidense (capturada).","summary":"La NFL anunció que el espectáculo de medio tiempo del Super Bowl LX estará encabezado por nada menos que Bad Bunny. Estamos aquí para contarte el porqué, así como lo que los medios no te dirán mientras se esfuerzan por cubrir la noticia.\n\nEl por qué es bastante simple: la liga se está expandiendo a Latinoamérica y más allá, y Bad Bunny es una auténtica superestrella mundial. Con miles de millones de descargas en su haber y una creciente presencia en el mainstream, su contratación, seis años después de aparecer en el espectáculo de medio tiempo de Shakira y J-Lo, fue una obviedad. Al menos en teoría.\n\nA primera vista, parece que la NFL contrató a Bad Bunny sin apenas investigarlo más allá de su éxito musical. Es mucho más probable que, de hecho, lo investigaran a fondo antes de contratarlo deliberadamente, lo que demuestra que la liga sigue sumida en el virus del wokismo.\n\nEl apoyo de Bad Bunny a Kamala Harris en las elecciones presidenciales de 2024 (aunque no compuso nada en Pensilvania ni en otros estados c","url":"https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/latino/jorge-bonilla/2025/09/29/bad-bunny-en-el-super-bowl-marketing-brillante-malisima","image":"https://cdn.newsbusters.org/styles/mobile_thumb_700x400_/s3/2025-09/Today%203rd%20Hour-10_05_09%20am-2025-09-29_0.jpg?itok=UzLRIPUA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-29 11:09:00","author":"Jorge Bonilla","authors":["Jorge Bonilla"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.608},{"id":364482098,"title":"Trump Claims He Can “Predict the Future” at UN — Couldn’t Predict Online Trolling","text":"Self-promotion is an evergreen feature of President Donald Trump, and once again, it became evident when he himself said that he can predict the future, at the UN General Assembly, and on the contrary, social media netizens couldn’t help but start their trolling. It has been for decades that scientists have been of the view that the world is heating up at a dangerous pace because with a significant reason behind it being fossil fuels.\n\nHowever, Trump has something else on his mind regarding this. He stated the change in this climate is just “a con job” and on top of that he further warned the countries that they would “fail” if they didn’t abandon what he branded the “green scam.”\n\nAnd it is not where things end as the President further bragged, “I’ve been right about everything.” With all these comments, he simply slammed the climate predictions all over the globe made by different well-known organizations regarding warming, cooling, energy transitions, and insisted that they were wrong all along.\n\nAnd quite justifiably, the internet didn’t hold back either, with a Threads user saying – “I personally think it’s wonderful that he is showing the entire world what an idiot he is.” And what made his overall speech more awkward is his talk about borders, shapes, and the atmosphere, which eventually turned his talk towards his supposed prophetic powers. “I’m really good at predicting things,” he boasted, recalling a campaign hat that declared “Trump was right about everything.”\n\nAnother person on social media posted – “I’m really good at predicting things’ says the man with 6 bankruptcies,” with another adding – “And 32 felonies.” (Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts earlier this year in a hush money case in New York.)\n\nDespite all these, the chaos still continued when Trump shed light on the radical environmentalists who are supposedly looking forward to banning cows. And more claims came like the US skies are being circled with dirty air, which is coming from China. He reflected that America now has the “cleanest air in many, many years” which actually isn’t fully the case, because according to the American Lung Association, millions of people in the country still breathe unhealthy air.\n\nScientists quickly pushed back. Andrew Dessler, a climate expert at Texas A&M, explained that while oil companies once pushed the idea of a “carbon footprint” to shift blame onto consumers, none of that validates Trump’s claim that climate change itself is fake. Viewers, meanwhile, had a field day. Memes flew across Threads, with one mocking Trump’s oversized speech notes and another featuring Kamala Harris captioned: “Oh hi there. Are you looking for the person who told you this would happen?”\n\nBut one user summed up the surreal performance best: “THIS IS IT, finally. This is the exact moment Trump s##ts the bed and crosses the Rubicon of Derangement.” Trump may have been trying to project strength on the global stage — but instead, his wild words sparked laughter, disbelief, and a flood of memes that painted him as more clown than prophet.","summary":"Trump tried to look like a prophet, but the internet crowned him a punchline.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trump-claims-he-can-predict-the-future-at-un-couldnt-predict-online-trolling","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/President-Donald-J.-Trump-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-29 11:02:55","author":"Mayukh B","authors":["Mayukh B"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.257},{"id":364475806,"title":"Editorial overhaul: Washington Post's new opinion chief feels the weight of the challenges ahead","text":"EXCLUSIVE - It's not every day a young journalist is entrusted to completely overhaul the editorial pages of a major newspaper they just joined. But that's the situation 33-year-old Adam O'Neal has found himself in at The Washington Post. \"I just feel a tremendous responsibility to get this right,\" O'Neal told Fox News Digital in his first interview since becoming The Post's new opinion editor. O'Neal joined The Post in July after serving as a correspondent for the British outlet The Economist and as an editorial page writer for The Wall Street Journal. He was \"immediately intrigued\" by the viral mission statement the paper's billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, laid out in February, saying The Post's editorial pages would promote \"personal liberties and free markets\" going forward and vowed not to publish pieces opposing those principles. Bezos' edict led to the immediate resignation of O'Neal's predecessor, David Shipley. The core principles of personal liberties and free markets were concepts O'Neal thought were \"underserved in the current media environment.\" \"Being able to start with that, as the North Star, but have the ability to build around that as an intellectual foundation, knowing that there's still a huge room within free markets and personal liberties for a robust debate about the future of America was hugely appealing to me,\" O'Neal said. \"And so, when I started speaking to The Post, I was able to be very clear and direct about what I thought this means and we kind of went from there. And I was very delighted to see, as I learned more about the role and the vision for the future, that I was aligned with it and was just very enthusiastic about getting to work on changing this place.\" WASHINGTON POST CEO URGES STAFFERS WHO DON'T ‘FEEL ALIGNED’ WITH PAPER'S NEW DIRECTION TO TAKE BUYOUT O'Neal calls the current state of the editorial pages a \"work in progress\" and that reshaping them will take time. That includes redefining the voice of the editorial board, which he says is still developing. \"So one day we might be saying, ‘Hey, you know, the president has a good point about Bagram Air Base,’ right? At the other time, we might praise Democrats who are standing up to [New York City mayoral candidate Zohran] Mamdani and his radicalism. And at the same time, we'll criticize the Trump administration when we think they get it wrong. So, if anyone thinks that our project here is about one president or just tactical partisan moves, I think that's really short-sighted, and they're just not reading or watching or listening to us very closely, frankly,\" O'Neal said. The Post's pivot, however, doesn't come without risk. Bezos' editorial announcement ignited backlash from the left, fueling resignations among staffers and a massive wave of subscription cancellations, fallout similar to when Bezos quashed The Post's endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the November election. JEFF BEZOS' TENURE AS WASHINGTON POST OWNER IN SPOTLIGHT AS PAPER GRAPPLES WITH LOW MORALE, STAFFER EXODUS \"Our readers are overwhelmingly liberal, right?\" O'Neal conceded. \"And they're all overwhelmingly located in blue states. And just a few blue states. And they're over-represented on the coasts. And so, one way to look at it would be to say, 'Well, if you're non-partisan, and you have a highly partisan readership, they may be offended by that.' And maybe that's true. But looking forward as I rebuild, I really just see it as an opportunity to expand our reach.\" He continued, \"And frankly, a lot of people don't trust The Post. And they don't trust the mainstream media more broadly. And so my mission is to hire the kinds of people from throughout the U.S. with different kinds of backgrounds, intellectual diversity, who can appeal and rebuild that trust. And I think that a lot of folks have a poor view of The Post because they don't feel that they've been well served by it.\" \"So is it possible that highly partisan readers will no longer like it when we're not just a lining on one side on every issue? I don't think that was exactly always the case, but if there are people who had a perception that subscribing to The Post was like a form of activism and that they had to do it to oppose a particular politician or party now that we're opening up our lands and writing more widely in a nonpartisan way, I don't know, maybe you'll lose people that way, but I think the upside of where the growth is by appealing to many more Americans in rebuilding that trust, to me, that's a pretty clear decision.\" WASHINGTON POST OPINIONS SECTION ANXIOUSLY AWAITS NEW LEADER AFTER JEFF BEZOS PUSHED DAVID SHIPLEY OUT O'Neal expressed excitement towards building out his team as he aims to find people \"outside of the usual places\" with different professional backgrounds, floating the idea of hiring veterans or a commodities trader versus solely relying on Ivy League graduates and esteemed economists. \"I have a journalism degree, I'm sorry to say,\" O'Neal cheekily admitted. \"So some people can kind of manage to get through [journalism school] OK, but we also really just want to cast that wide net, and I think it'll become, over time, a strategic advantage for us to get the voices and the minds that were overlooked through the traditional way of thinking about journalism.\" What counts for diversity in newsrooms is perhaps subject for debate. Former Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah, who was fired earlier this month for her social media posts about Charlie Kirk's assassination, said she was \"the last remaining Black full-time opinion columnist\" and that Washington, D.C. \"no longer has a paper that reflects the [diverse] people it serves\" (Attiah has since sent a legal threat to The Post, alleging she was wrongly terminated). While he declined to comment on personnel matters involving Attiah, O'Neal challenged the notion that her ouster means The Post's editorial team lacks diversity. \"We are going to evaluate every potential hire equally. It's the quality of their journalism, the background and the knowledge that they can bring to the job,\" O'Neal said. \"I don't think the opinion section is ever going to be in a place where we have quotas, and we're getting people just to get people because they have some immutable characteristic,\" he added. \"So, I'll never hire someone because of their race or gender or anything like that.\" WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST FIRED OVER SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS AFTER CHARLIE KIRK'S ASSASSINATION The last several years at The Washington Post have been turbulent between significant financial losses, the exodus of talent that has fled to competing outlets, and low morale in the newsroom. Will Lewis, the British media executive who will soon approach the two-year mark as The Post's publisher and CEO, has ruffled feathers throughout his tenure at the paper for his leadership style and his brash approach to tough conversations. He famously told staff in June 2024: \"People are not reading your stuff. I can’t sugarcoat it anymore.\" Lewis would later walk back those remarks. O'Neal called Lewis a \"fantastic journalist\" \"who's really damn good at his job.\" \"I came into this job with tremendous respect and also confidence in Will, and it's only grown,\" O'Neal said. \"He's been a great mentor, and we're completely aligned about the direction of travel. And we have the same values when it comes to journalism and where we want to take The Post. Will has been absolutely fantastic to work for.\" O'Neal said he hadn't read much of the critical reporting on Lewis before joining The Post. He instead relied on colleagues who had worked with Lewis at other British publications. They spoke highly of him. \"I would say he's met my high expectations — not that it's incumbent on Will to meet my expectations, but I just think really highly of the guy and, you know, going into the job I did, and I still do,\" he said. The Washington Post's editorial moves from Bezos have been seen by liberal critics as appeasing President Donald Trump, but the \"Democracy Dies in Darkness\" paper is in good company. Other legacy news organizations have been accused of bending the knee, like ABC and CBS settling multi-million-dollar lawsuits with the president. Trump's antagonistic relationship with the press has only ratcheted up during his second term between his administration brawling with The Associated Press over \"Gulf of America,\" his lawyers taking aim at The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, and his renewed feud with ABC following Jimmy Kimmel's comments about the Kirk assassination. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE At a time when his media colleagues are decrying threats to free speech, O'Neal doesn't seem concerned. \"For me, it's about our journalism. I don't really think about any noise outside of that,\" O'Neal said. \"We're just providing the most accurate, interesting and compelling journalism for America. And you'd go crazy if you just sat around thinking about how will subscribers or a politician or whoever respond to it. You just have to do what you think is right. And that's how I think about my journalism.\" Several of The Post's most high-profile columnists had taken buyouts over the summer (Jonathan Capehart, Catherine Rampell, Philip Bump just to name a few). O'Neal remains optimistic that the staffers who chose to stay are truly onboard with the new mission he is tasked to champion. \"We don't want people here who are just sort of resigned to the changes and, ‘Oh OK, maybe I can live with this,’ but who are genuinely excited about it,\" O'Neal said. \"I just came from an editorial board meeting this morning. It was energetic. We're having debates, we're all getting to know each other better. And so everybody that I'm interacting with is fired up. And look, the place is still gonna continue to change, right? We're still working on restructuring it, changing our workflows,\" he continued. \"So, it's ever evolving. But in my corner of The Post, the opinion section, I feel nothing but momentum and great energy. And we've been very clear with everybody about the direction of travel, and I'm nothing but excited about it.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Not only does O'Neal have to implement what he calls The Post's \"distinct voice\" on the editorial pages, he also has to bring the opinion section to the 21st century, acknowledging it was \"not where it needed to be\" in the ever-evolving media landscape. \"Personally, I like print newspapers. I enjoy the tactile experience of reading a paper, how it's organized. But some people want to get their news through TikTok… Some people prefer YouTube, podcasts,\" O'Neal said. \"And I think, frankly, we're playing catch-up because we've not done enough on that, and we're putting a huge amount of resources, time and energy into any piece of journalism we do eventually should be able to be provided to you in the format that you prefer.\" While he says becoming The Post's opinion editor \"is the challenge of my career,\" O'Neal insists he's \"having a lot of fun.\" \"My goal is to elevate the people around me and to make their careers as fun and interesting as possible, because I know a lot of folks are, you know, not so thrilled with journalists. And I think oftentimes with reason. There's been a lot of failures in this industry to inform the public. And so I just see this as a chance to get it right,\" O'Neal said.","summary":"The Washington Post&apos;s new opinion editor Adam O&apos;Neal spoke with Fox News Digital about the challenges he faces as he reshapes the paper&apos;s editorial pages.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/editorial-overhaul-washington-posts-new-opinion-chief-feels-weight-challenges-ahead","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/09/adam-oneal-1.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6365564307112","publish_date":"2025-09-29 11:00:43","author":"Brian Flood,Joseph Wulfsohn","authors":["Brian Flood","Joseph Wulfsohn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.257},{"id":364475814,"title":"Michigan church attack leaves at least 4 dead, suspect identified and more top headlines","text":"Good morning and welcome to Fox News’ morning newsletter, Fox News First.

We’re here to tell you the why, as well as what the rest of the media won’t tell you as they trip over themselves trying to cover the story.\n\nThe why is simple enough: The league is expanding into Latin America and beyond, and Bad Bunny is a bonafide global superstar. With billions of downloads under his belt as well as a growing mainstream presence his booking, six years after appearing during Shakira and J-Lo’s halftime show, was a no-brainer. At least on paper.\n\nAt first blush, it appears that the NFL booked Bad Bunny with little to no vetting beyond his musical success. It is far likelier that he was in fact fully vetted prior to being purposefully booked, proof evident that the league is still fully in the throes of the woke mind virus. \n\nBad Bunny’s endorsement of Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election (although of no effect in Pennsylvania and other swing states with significant Hispanic populations) proves him to be a politically divisive figure. He advocates for Puerto Rican independence and outright separation from the United States, a position favored by only 12% of the island’s population, while retreating to the comforts of mansions in Hollywood and elsewhere. \n\nThen there is the matter of the rank hypocrisy of Bad Bunny playing the Super Bowl after allegedly refusing to tour in the mainland U.S. due to ICE raids, which supposedly compelled him to do a 30-date residency in Puerto Rico instead, a narrative that the media gleefully and uncritically advanced. For starters, ICE has an active presence in Puerto Rico, and has conducted raids in accordance with existing policy. Then there is the matter of the residency itself. Per multiple accounts, the residency was booked in 2023- when Joe Biden was allowing illegal aliens to flood into the country with nary an ICE agent to be seen. What ensued was a brilliant piece of marketing meant to ensure sell outs while saving on travel, logistics, and while avoiding the embarrassment of having to cancel concerts due to poor sales in cities such as Minneapolis.\n\nLinguistically, this may be a very interesting performance. Super Bowl LX will air on Comcast siblings NBC and Telemundo. Whereas NBC will likely let Bad Bunny’s obscene bleatings ride with a “Singing in non-English” caption, Telemundo’s censors will have to run for their lives. Consider a minuscule sampling of Bad Bunny’s lyrical offerings on, say, Safaera (ADVISORY):\n\nMy cock is a fugitive and I want you to harbor it/ grab it like a bonga/ She popped a pill that made her horny/ She fucks in Audis, not in Hondas/ Hey, if I fuck you don’t call me/ This ain’t for you to fall in love- hey/ If your boyfriend doesn’t eat your asshole/ He might as well not eat at all\n\nAnd on Baticano:\n\nThe night got kinky/ Three fingers in the pussy, in the asshole the pinky/ The bud, purple like Inky Winky/ Smack her in the ass and leave her like Po, hey/ I’ll hit it where she pees, and where she poops\n\nThe worst part of all is that this performance will be hailed as proof evident that diversity is our greatest strength, and as a triumph of Latino culture. That’s a hard no on both counts. \n\nBad Bunny’s Super Bowl performance is not a triumph of the traditional “God, country, and family” values that Hispanics have espoused for centuries and brought to America since before the Revolutionary War. However, it is a high-water mark for an artificial and political Latino identity that seeks to perpetuate a permanent alien underclass forever separate and alien from the mainstream of American (captured) culture.\n\nTo showcase this brain rot at such a quintessentially American institution as the Super Bowl is a sign of the extent to which our culture remains captured by the far left.","summary":"[LANGUAGE WARNING]\n\nThe NFL announced that the halftime show at Super Bowl LX will be headlined by none other than Bad Bunny.

A gunman opened fire this week at a Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, killing one detainee and injuring two others. Less than two weeks earlier, conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated, with officials saying the suspect left behind ammunition etched with a reference to fascism.\n\nFrom the House floor to campaign rallies, Democratic lawmakers and leaders have embraced the label, arguing that Trump’s conduct in office leaves them no choice but to call it the way they see it. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, on her recent book tour this week, compared Trump and his allies to “a communist dictatorship” for quashing dissent. \n\nThat defiance was echoed last week at a press conference where Democrats denounced what they described as an assault on free expression, held after ABC suspended late-night host Jimmy Kimmel for remarks about Kirk’s assassination.\n\n“Fascism is not on the way. It is here,” Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-FL) said at the event. “The First Amendment is how generations of Americans, from civil rights activists to labor organizers, American workers, LGBTQ+ activists, have fought for progress, and it is our power.”\n\nAt the same press conference, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) was asked by a reporter whether Democrats’ rhetoric was partly to blame for political violence. He said candor was essential.\n\n“Donald Trump is trying to destroy our democracy. He is trying to silence free speech. He is acting in a way that is scarily similar to many would-be despots all across history,” Murphy said. “We have no obligation to sugarcoat the gravity of this moment. The only way we save this nation is if the people of this country rise up in peaceful protest, if they mobilize all across America.”\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) was equally blunt in a House Oversight Committee hearing that same day. “We need to stand up against this fascist takeover,” she said. “That’s not a bad word, it’s a fact.”\n\nDemocrats have steadily escalated their warnings about Trump by invoking the language of fascism. Back in 2022, former President Joe Biden described Trump’s governing philosophy as “semi-fascist.” By the next year, Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, her running mate, dropped any qualifiers, calling Trump a fascist outright. \n\nThe message sharpened further in August 2025, when Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin delivered a fiery address at the party’s summer meeting, declaring Trump represented not just partisan opposition but an existential threat. “This is not politics as usual, my friends,” Martin told the crowd. “This is authoritarianism. It’s fascism dressed in a red tie. And we, each of you in this room, and all of the Democrats throughout this country, we are the only thing standing in his way.”\n\nMartin has not backed away from the “fascist” label. But in a statement after the ICE shooting this week, he struck a different tone, condemning the violence and urging unity. “It will take all of us — not just one side of the aisle or the other — to quell this epidemic of violence, which has no place in our democracy,” he said.\n\nA Democratic strategist, speaking on background to reflect candidly on the situation, acknowledged the risks of that approach. “I think there’s no doubt that the political temperature in our country is a bit too hot right now,” the strategist said. “At this moment, I would advise any Democratic candidate or politician I work with not to use the word fascist or dictator in their jargon, especially after what has played out lately.” \n\nEven so, Democrats and their allies argue the president’s actions aren’t making it easier to hold back. They denounced Thursday’s move by federal prosecutors to indict former FBI Director James Comey, a longtime Trump target, as politically motivated and lacking merit. “The Comey stuff makes this all really complicated,” the strategist added. “But I think two wrongs don’t make a right, and Democrats need to take the high road.”\n\nRepublicans argue the Democratic language is incendiary and dangerous. “If you want to stop political violence, stop telling your supporters that everybody who disagrees with you politically is a Nazi,” Vice President JD Vance told a crowd in North Carolina on Wednesday, a reference to both the ICE shooting in Dallas this week and Kirk’s killing two weeks earlier as proof of rising risks. \n\nStrategists echoed the warning. “They are inciting crazy people to do crazy things through their very words,” GOP strategist Dennis Lennox said. “Democrats aren’t going to win next year by pouring gasoline on the fire.”\n\nGreg Manz, another Republican strategist, argued Democrats were guilty of projection. “Their history, especially during the Biden administration, is riddled with censoring free speech and weaponizing the government,” he said, speaking to the Washington Examiner. “Now they stand idle as law enforcement faces surging assaults. This smear tactic won’t stick, it’ll backfire.”\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee recently cited polling showing liberals are more likely than conservatives to say political violence is sometimes justified. “For far too long, Democrats have excused riots, smeared conservatives as ‘fascists,’ and winked at violent rhetoric from their own ranks,” spokesman Mike Marinella said. “Now the numbers prove it: the left has normalized hate and turned political violence into just another talking point.” \n\nAnd a super PAC aligned with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), the Congressional Leadership Fund, has begun targeting Democrats in vulnerable districts who have used the term, accusing them of crossing a line and abandoning “decency and morality.”\n\nTrump, speaking at Kirk’s memorial on Sunday, tied the killing to the broader fight over rhetoric. He said the same people now “screaming fascism” had implied Kirk deserved his fate.\n\n“No side in American politics has a monopoly on disturbed or misguided people,” Trump said. “But one part of our political community believes they have a monopoly on power, thought, and speech. Well, that’s not happening anymore.”","summary":"Democrats are refusing to back away from calling President Donald Trump and his allies “fascist,” even as Republicans intensify warnings that the rhetoric is reckless, dangerous, and fueling political violence. “Fascism,” a right-wing system of government led by a dictator, is historically tied to Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, an [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/congressional/3827134/democrats-refuse-tone-down-fascist-language-political-violence/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25244746187138.jpg?w=696","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-29 10:00:00","author":"Samantha-Jo Roth","authors":["Samantha-Jo Roth"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.424},{"id":364457872,"title":"AI giant Anthropic faces possible clash with White House — as backers include left-wing Ford Foundation: sources","text":"AI giant Anthropic is facing a possible head-on collision with the Trump administration — as concerns from conservatives multiply that the fast-growing firm carries a left-wing bias, The Post has learned.\n\nInvestors in the San Francisco-based company — known for its popular Claude chatbot — include the Ford Foundation, a notoriously left-leaning group that bought $5 million worth of Anthropic shares in March 2024 in the bankruptcy of disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto empire, according to little-noticed court filings.\n\nEarlier this month, Vice President JD Vance called out the Ford Foundation by name while vowing to “go after the NGO network that foments, facilitates and engages in violence” following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nThat’s after Anthropic recently irritated Trump officials by barring federal contractors from using its tools for some law enforcement purposes. Some at the White House have grumbled that Anthropic, whose CEO Dario Amodei is a prominent Democratic donor, could be “selectively enforcing its policies” due to differing political views, Semafor reported.\n\nTaken together, the two data points are likely to invite unwelcome scrutiny for Anthropic — even as rivals including Sam Altman’s OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI have worked to curry favor with the White House, a source close to the Trump administration said.\n\n“When [the White House] is looking for a collaborative partner and suddenly they start being obstinate over White House objectives, and it comes to surface that they got a significant investment from a hostile political organization – which is what I would consider the Ford Foundation to be – I think you’re going to see a lot of eyebrows being raised,” the source added.\n\nAnthropic, whose backers include Amazon and Google, is competing with OpenAI, xAI and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta for everything from lucrative federal contracts to crafting potential federal regulations around AI. \n\nBut even before the latest flap over AI usage by federal contractors, Anthropic’s relationship with the White House – and key administration officials like AI czar David Sacks – was already seen as shaky at best.\n\nAnthropic’s Amodei called Trump a “feudal warlord” in a now-deleted social media post expressing support for Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 election. In 2018, he described Trump as a “serious and legitimate threat to the rule of law.”\n\nDuring a May episode of the popular “All In” podcast, Sacks said Anthropic was part of group of tech “doomers” that he described as “committed leftists” and “Trump haters” with ties to the effective altruism movement, which once counted Bankman-Fried among its elite backers.\n\nSacks also pointed out that several ex-Biden administration staffers had joined Anthropic and that Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, a Democratic megadonor, was part of its board of directors.\n\nAmodei was one of the few tech honchos who skipped Trump’s inauguration in January, though he did attend an administration event about energy policy in Pittsburgh in July.\n\nHe has also raised the hackles of some AI leaders with frequent warnings about the technology’s risks. Amodei has said executives and politicians should stop “sugar-coating” the mass layoffs that could occur due to AI and suggested unemployment could hit 20%. He’s also warned of a 25% chance that things go “really, really badly” for humanity as AI gets more advanced.\n\nDaniela Amodei, his sister and a fellow co-founder of Anthropic, has a long history of donating to Democrats, include Harris, Joe Biden and Barack Obama.\n\n“When it comes to policy and trying to foment the golden age of American economic dominance, the White House is looking for partners who want to put America first and want to work together collaboratively,” the source close to the White House added.\n\nDespite its differences with the administration, Anthropic has secured a number of federal contracts – including a $200 million contract with the Department of War and a partnership with the US General Services Administration.\n\nAnthropic has also expressed support for the White House’s AI Action Plan, declaring it was “encouraged by the plan’s focus on accelerating AI infrastructure and federal adoption, as well as strengthening safety testing and security coordination.”\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAnthropic’s valuation was just $18.4 billion in early 2024. But as of earlier this month, Anthropic had secured an $183 billion post-money valuation. Depending on the share structure, that means Ford Foundation’s stake, while tiny compared to key backers like Google and Amazon, has seen a huge increase in value over the last year.\n\nAn Anthropic spokesperson said the Ford Foundation represents a small fraction of the firm’s overall investor base. Ford does not have any influence over Anthropic’s policy positions or business activities, the spokesperson added.\n\n“We are committed to protecting America’s lead in AI, defending and upholding America’s democratic values, and contesting the advance of authoritarian adversaries,” the Anthropic spokesperson said. “As part of that commitment, Anthropic was an early mover in deploying AI for national security and intelligence work, and we work with the intelligence community in many different capacities.”\n\nThe spokesperson also pushed back on the notion that Anthropic has a rift with the Trump administration.\n\nWhile Anthropic’s policies bar the use of its AI tools for “direct domestic surveillance and related collection of data,” multiple federal law enforcement agencies “are currently using Claude for research, analysis, and other use cases.”\n\nOther AI giants, including OpenAI, Microsoft and Google, have policies restricting use of their AI tools for surveillance purposes.\n\nA Ford Foundation spokesperson said: “Like any other passive investor in a company, the Ford Foundation has no role in Anthropic’s management or business activities.”\n\nVance, who co-hosted an episode of “The Charlie Kirk Show” after the assassination, alleged that the Ford Foundation and the George Soros-backed Open Society Foundations had provided funding to progressive magazine The Nation.\n\nThe vice president slammed the outlet for misrepresenting Kirk’s words in an article titled “Charlie Kirk’s Legacy Deserves No Mourning.” In response, Open Society said it never funded The Nation, while Ford Foundation said it hasn’t funded the outlet since 2019.\n\nThe allegation was part of a larger pledge by Vance to target progressive groups that he accused of stoking a rise of left-wing violence.","summary":"The left-wing activist group Ford Foundation owns a chunk of Anthropic – a little-noticed connection that could prove problematic for the AI giant given signs of a widening rift with the Trump administration, The Post has learned.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/29/business/ai-giant-anthropic-faces-possible-clash-with-white-house-as-backers-include-left-wing-ford-foundation-sources/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/112344877.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/g75YPViH-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-29 10:00:00","author":"Thomas Barrabi","authors":["Thomas Barrabi"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":364471998,"title":"Democrats Are in Crisis. Eat-the-Rich Populism Is the Only Answer.","text":"The strategy would be a lot more defensible if Democrats could write off Trumpism as a fever that was bound to break with time. But the evidence of the past few years points in the opposite direction — shrinking populations in blue states, an alarming drop in Democratic voter registration, dire math for retaking the Senate and crushing majorities who say the party is “out of touch.” Worst of all is the ongoing rightward shift in the working class, a challenge that goes beyond winning elections to strike at the heart of what it means to be a Democrat.\n\nA few campaigns have bucked those trends. The problem for Democrats is that the best examples come from candidates running against the Democratic Party.\n\nConsider Dan Osborn, a 50-year-old industrial mechanic and Navy veteran who is making his second bid for the Senate in Nebraska as an independent. In 2024, while Donald Trump demolished Kamala Harris by 20 points, Mr. Osborn lost by just 7. According to the analytics website Split Ticket, this was the strongest performance relative to the partisan fundamentals of any Senate candidate.\n\nWhat was Mr. Osborn’s secret? He’s a sometimes fumbling speaker, and he didn’t put together a world-beating ground game or dominate social media. But he was a credible spokesman for a message that resonated with voters in Nebraska — a blistering assault on economic elites, a moderate stance on cultural issues and the rejection of politics as usual.\n\nNow, think about the biggest story of the 2025 election season, Zohran Mamdani’s come-from-nowhere victory in the New York City mayoral primary. From the start, Mr. Mamdani positioned himself as a fresh face confronting a dysfunctional system on behalf of ordinary New Yorkers struggling to pay their bills. He’s the happy class warrior blessed with Andrew Cuomo as his foil, a convenient stand-in for a corrupt and clueless establishment.","summary":"A blistering assault on economic elites, a moderate stance on cultural issues and a rejection of politics as usual.

The custom-built encrypted platform is advertised to ensure the full anonymity of its users.\n\nEarlier this month, Homeland Security sent a subpoena ordering Meta to turn over all subscriber names, email addresses, and telephone numbers associated with the website’s Instagram account @StopIceNet.\n\nIn response, CLDC and the ACLU’s Northern California chapter challenged the subpoena on First Amendment grounds, arguing in separate court cases that their clients’ operations are a form of constitutionally protected free speech.\n\n“[A]nonymous actors engaged in protected political speech possess a First Amendment right to remain anonymous,” says CLDC’s suit, particularly “rights to anonymous speech and association.”\n\n“I am haunted by the possibility that the government will find out who I am using this subpoena,” one of ACLU Northern California’s clients, proceeding pseudonymously as “John Doe,” said in a declaration submitted to the court.\n\nAccording to a press release, CLDC partnered with the ACLU of Northern California to help each of the six suspects cited in the subpoena find representation through their “legal networks.”\n\nCLDC, which is bankrolled by the Soros-backed Tides Center, says it “supports the struggle,” namely movements that “seek to dismantle the political and economic structures at the root of social inequality.”\n\nIn recent years, CLDC has represented a number of antifa clients, including two Rose City antifa militants who investigative journalist Andy Ngo sued for brutally assaulting him on the streets of Portland. The 2019 mob-style attack left him hospitalized with a bleeding brain.\n\nIn 2019, CLDC honored “in memoriam” school shooter Charlie Landeros, a known “non-binary” antifa activist. Most recently, CLDC called President Donald Trump’s executive order designating antifa as a domestic terrorist organization “B.S.” and claimed that the “majority of Americans hold antifascist political beliefs.”\n\nAs for the contested subpoena, Judge Thomas X. Hixson, a Kamala Harris donor, has since issued a temporary stay. This means Meta is under court order not to hand over the requested records to DHS until the matter is adjudicated.\n\nAccording to company policy, Meta may independently push back on government requests if the tech giant decides that a subpoena is “not consistent with applicable law or our policies.”\n\n“If the request is unlawful (for example, overly broad, or legally deficient in any way), we will challenge or reject the request,” Meta’s frequently-asked-questions page says. “We encourage governmental agencies to submit only requests that are necessary, proportionate, specific, and strictly compliant with applicable laws, by publishing guidelines for government requests.”\n\nThe Washington Examiner contacted CLDC, ACLU Northern California, Meta, and DHS for comment.\n\nDHS subpoenaing Meta comes after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem promised to pursue anyone involved in doxing efforts against ICE officers after the names, pictures, and personal addresses of agents were published.\n\n“We will prosecute those who dox ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law. These criminals are taking the side of vicious cartels and human traffickers,” Noem said in a statement. “We won’t allow it in America.”\n\nAuthorities say the sniper who shot up a Dallas immigration detention center on Wednesday searched for similar ICE tracking apps, indicative of “pre-attack planning.” Investigators also allegedly obtained written notes left behind by the shooter, one of which read, “Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror.”\n\nAlthough relatively little is known about the suspect, his Facebook profile picture reportedly depicted an image of an armed communist captioned, “GLORIOUS EXPOSITION, COMRADE.”","summary":"An antifa legal group, in partnership with the American Civil Liberties Union, is trying to prevent Meta from fulfilling a federal subpoena that would unmask the militants behind an anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement surveillance site.
