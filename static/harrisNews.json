Gov. Janet Mills (D), who announced her run for the Senate in October, called for withholding ICE’s funding until it changes its tactics. Mills’s primary opponent, oyster farmer Graham Platner, said he would join protesters in the streets and called for Mills to direct Maine law enforcement to follow ICE agents.\n\nTheir initial reactions signal how they plan to position themselves more broadly in a closely watched primary and an even more closely watched general election.\n\nICE launched its Catch of the Day operation in Maine on Wednesday as it continued a sustained presence in Minnesota that has drawn fierce protests, litigation and, on Friday, a general strike. An ICE agent this month fatally shot Renée Good, 37, in her vehicle in a residential neighborhood in Minneapolis, and many Democrats in Maine have called for resisting ICE in their state.\n\nImmigration was a strength for Trump in his 2024 campaign, but recent polls show voters oppose ICE’s recent activities. In a CBS News survey, 61 percent of Americans said ICE was too tough when it detained people. A Quinnipiac University poll found 57 percent of registered voters disapproved of how ICE was enforcing immigration laws and 53 percent believed Good’s shooting was unjustified.\n\nCollins is the only GOP senator to represent a state that Democratic nominee Kamala Harris won in 2024. She has a long record of appealing to Democrats and independents in addition to Republicans, and she’ll need to do that again to win a sixth term.\n\nCollins did not agree to an interview or answer questions from The Washington Post. In a statement on her website, Collins neither praised nor criticized ICE’s operations in Maine. People in the United States illegally who commit crimes should be deported, she said. Immigrants who are in the country legally should not be targeted by ICE and should seek assistance through advocacy networks if they are improperly detained, Collins said.\n\nCollins called for equipping ICE agents with body cameras and giving them de-escalation training. “At this time of heightened tensions, these steps could help improve trust, accountability, and safety,” she said in the statement.\n\nMills, in an interview, called on Congress to hold up funding for ICE until it changes its tactics. As the Senate Appropriations Committee chair, Collins should be leading that effort, Mills said.\n\n“How on earth does she let him - Trump - weaponize this agency to instill terror and fear?” Mills said of Collins.\n\nMills said she has been talking to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) and monitoring the lawsuit that officials in his state filed against ICE. She said Trump has “weaponized ICE” but it’s too soon to say if she would sue over its activities in her state.\n\nMills attended a fundraiser in San Francisco the day the Trump administration launched its operations in Maine. The event did not hamper her ability to respond to ICE, she said. She has been in steady contact with law enforcement at all levels, she said, and last week warned the public that ICE could ramp up enforcement.\n\nThe Trump administration, in announcing its increased enforcement in Maine this week, singled out Mills for criticism. “Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,” Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.\n\nAs governor, Mills last month said she was allowing a law to take effect without her signature that will limit how local and state law enforcement work with immigration authorities. She expressed some reservations about the measure but said she supported it in the face of “horrifying actions” by ICE. She also rescinded a policy by a Republican predecessor that required state law enforcement to provide enhanced cooperation with federal officials on immigration.\n\nPlatner in an interview criticized the Trump administration in blunt terms. He called ICE a “political paramilitary group” that is kidnapping people and putting them in “essentially concentration camps.” He accused ICE of murder and said Trump officials are “living out their authoritarian fantasies” based on “nothing but racism and lies.”\n\nPlatner, who was in Norway this week with his wife while she received in vitro fertilization treatment, said he would join protests in Maine on Saturday. He said he supports Maine residents tracking the movements of ICE and using whistles to alert the public to agents’ presence, saying that opposing ICE requires both public officials and ordinary citizens.\n\nPlatner said the governor should direct law enforcement agencies to follow ICE agents to ensure they’re acting legally. And, he said, Mills should sue to try to limit enforcement activities in Maine.\n\nAnd Collins should be speaking out forcefully against “a federal agency being used to terrorize Mainers,” Platner said.\n\nThough the issue could hurt Collins, it carries risk for all three candidates. Platner, if he advances to a general election, could turn off moderate voters with his calls to confront officers or if he is seen as too soft on immigration. Mills, as governor, faces the prospect that she could be blamed for an escalation.\n\nDemocrats are debating the best way to respond politically. Blue Rose Research, a Democratic research firm, found in video testing that raw eyewitness footage and straightforward reporting on the Minneapolis shooting “drove meaningful increases in Trump disapproval, while ideological or maximalist rhetoric from elected officials often underperformed or backlashed,” according to a Jan. 13 memo obtained by The Post.\n\nMills has sought to fend off Platner’s more progressive rhetoric by highlighting her willingness to confront Trump. She made headlines last year when, with cameras rolling, she faced off with Trump in the White House over the state’s policies on transgender athletes. “We’ll see you in court,” she said in a clip that quickly spread online.\n\nAnother moment like the one in the White House could help her in the June primary, said Jessica Taylor, who analyzes Senate races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. But there are also major risks for Mills if anything goes awry in the state she runs, Taylor added.\n\nThe ICE surge could also affect the race for a Republican-leaning House seat in northern Maine. Democratic Rep. Jared Golden is not running for reelection, fueling Republican hopes of flipping it as they try to preserve their narrow control of the House. While most of the district is far from Portland, it includes Lewiston, where ICE has been active.\n\nBut Republicans view the Senate race as crucial to defending their 53-seat majority. The Senate Leadership Fund, the main Senate Republican super PAC, said this week that it was investing $42 million in the state, with most of the money going toward ads that will begin running in August.\n\nJason Savage, executive director of the Maine Republican Party, said he considered ICE’s operations “net neutral in an ordinary environment” because voters in the state broadly support law enforcement. But, he said, the agency’s activities are a “net positive” for Republicans “when both of the opponents are acting insane about it.”\n\nSome Democrats have argued that the deployment will hurt Collins.\n\n“Any time the Trump administration is sending ICE into communities and causing chaos, it will put the Republican legislators there - including, in this case, Susan Collins - in a very uncomfortable situation, because they are unable to break with Trump in a meaningful way,” said Lauren French, a spokesperson for Senate Majority PAC, the flagship Democratic super PAC involved in Senate races.\n\nDan Merica contributed to this report.","url":"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/24/nation/susan-collins-maine-immigration-raid/","image":"https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/QIVUZPSR5RBNJKXCYWRWF6LVMU.jpg?auth=e3c7f784f720c8ad9caa7c50aa4c8a1123519b5781b3d5e539cfcbfafe18bccf&width=1200&height=672","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 23:24:47","author":"Patrick Marley","authors":["Patrick Marley"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.213},{"id":395776548,"title":"Trump and Democrats harden their stances after Minneapolis shooting","text":"Bovino told reporters that “an individual approached U.S. Border Patrol agents with a nine millimeter semi-automatic handgun. The agents attempted to disarm the individual, but he violently resisted. Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, a border patrol agent fired defensive shots.” But when asked by a reporter when the individual drew his firearm, Bovino said the shooting is still under investigation.\n\nThe latest POLITICO Poll illustrates just how sharply views of ICE — and its presence in cities across the country — diverge along partisan lines. A majority of voters who backed Trump in 2024 — 57 percent — say risks to the lives of anti-ICE protestors are a price worth paying to carry out immigration enforcement, compared with just 15 percent of voters who backed former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBy contrast, nearly three-quarters of Harris voters — 71 percent — say it is not worth risking the lives of anti-ICE protesters to conduct immigration enforcement, a view shared by just 31 percent of Trump voters, the poll, conducted from Jan. 16 to 19, found.\n\nThe divide extends to perceptions of public safety: 64 percent of Trump voters say ICE agents make U.S. cities safer, while 80 percent of Harris voters say the opposite, that their presence is making them more dangerous.\n\nDemocrats also used heated language to describe the shooting. During a Democratic Senate primary debate in Texas on Saturday, state Rep. James Talarico raised the Minneapolis shooting, saying: “ICE shot a mother in the face. ICE kidnapped a 5-year-old boy. ICE executed a man in broad daylight on our streets just this morning. It’s time to tear down this secret police force and replace it with an agency that actually is going to focus on public safety.”\n\nHis opponent, Rep. Jasmine Crockett, also weighed in: “This is the fifth-highest funded military force in the entire world. And what are they doing? They’re killing people in the middle of the street.”\n\nWalz on Saturday urged the federal government to allow Minnesota officials to take control of the probe into the shooting. He told reporters that he said to the White House in an early morning call that “the federal government cannot be trusted to lead this investigation. The state will handle it, period.”\n\n“As I said last week, this federal occupation of Minnesota long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement,” Walz said at a press conference Saturday. “It’s a campaign of organized brutality against the people of our state. And today, that campaign claimed another life. I’ve seen the videos from several angles. And it’s sickening.”\n\nWhen asked for comment, the White House referred POLITICO to Trump’s Truth Social post and to a post on X from the Department of Homeland Security, which claimed, “The officers attempted to disarm the suspect but the armed suspect violently resisted.”","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/24/minneapolis-shooting-ice-trump-democrats-00745630","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/e211715/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F33%2F66%2Ff3dd85dc4fdbb7faa2732e801c89%2Fimmigration-enforcement-minnesota-53307.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 23:09:00","author":"Ben Johansen,Erin Doherty,Gregory Svirnovskiy","authors":["Ben Johansen","Erin Doherty","Gregory Svirnovskiy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.123},{"id":395763818,"title":"Fake US attorney steps down, and one media outlet grows a spine","text":"Injustice for All is a weekly series about how the Trump administration is trying to weaponize the justice system—and the people who are fighting back.\n\nThis week, we say goodbye to supposed U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, which is great, but we also say hello to Judge Aileen Cannon, which is very not great. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also inadvertently reminds us that the only role of the current federal government is to execute President Donald Trump’s personal demands. \n\nLol, Lindsey Halligan. Lol.\n\nHalligan has held on as long as humanly possible, swanning around the Eastern District of Virginia and signing indictments as the U.S. attorney despite a court telling her she was not the U.S. attorney. Earlier this month, a judge ordered Halligan to explain why she thought she could do this, resulting in a filing that the judge in the case, Trump appointee David Novak, said “contains a level of vitriol more appropriate for a cable news talk show and falls far beneath the level of advocacy expected from litigants in this Court, particularly the Department of Justice.” \n\nWith that, you will likely not be surprised that Novak ruled this past Tuesday that no, really, the court did not stutter: Halligan cannot keep passing herself off as the U.S. attorney. \n\nSomehow, Novak was not swayed by Halligan’s argument that even though a judge ruled she wasn’t legally in her job and never had been, that somehow applied only to the prosecutions of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Nor did he buy her whining that, since former special counsel Jack Smith may have continued to sign things as special counsel after Judge Aileen Cannon threw out the classified documents case against Trump, she gets to cosplay as the U.S. attorney. Also a nope: the usual Justice Department argument that the court has no authority to do anything Trump doesn’t like. \n\nThe DOJ also told Novak that he was impinging on the executive branch's authority by reminding Halligan of her ethical obligations as a lawyer, and that the court could take action when ethical rules were violated. Novak didn’t like that one either, pointing out that being employed by the DOJ isn't some magical shield that protects attorneys from the ethical rules everyone else has to follow. \n\nNovak’s opinion dropped on Jan. 20, the same day that a different judge in the district published a vacancy notice, soliciting applicants for the interim U.S. attorney gig. Since Halligan is out, the judges in the U.S. attorney’s office can choose their own person for the role. \n\nThat very same day, Halligan finally announced she would be stepping down, which is an odd thing to announce about a job she never actually had. But if Halligan’s appointment as interim U.S. attorney had been valid, it would have expired on Jan. 20—120 days after she was fake-appointed. \n\nHalligan’s attempt to do the “You can’t fire me because I quit” move is equal parts pathetic and hilarious. Regardless, we won’t have her to kick around any longer. \n\nMaybe. Possibly. \n\nOkay, probably not. Halligan is an extremely bad penny, and she’s bound to turn up somewhere else. \n\nThanks, Aileen Cannon\n\nJudge Aileen Cannon is clutch when it comes to coming through for Trump. She has been protecting him for over a year now, keeping part two of Jack Smith’s special counsel investigation secret because Trump wants it that way. \n\nCannon has been presiding over a case by oversight and journalism watchdogs seeking to force the release of Smith’s report documenting his investigation into Trump’s illegal retention of classified documents, which he stashed at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Cannon helpfully enjoined its release, saying she couldn’t release it while Trump’s co-defendants were still litigating their criminal charges, but the DOJ dismissed those cases ages ago. \n\nCannon dragged her feet so long that in early November, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ordered her to rule on whether to release the report within 60 days, which came and went earlier this month. Instead, Cannon let Trump intervene in the lawsuit to explain how it would be unfair and make him very sad. \n\nNow, Cannon has a motion from Trump explaining that since she voided the prosecution by inventing some new rule that special counsels were basically illegal, the underlying report can never be released. It’s a perfect opportunity for one of Trump’s pet judges to display her fealty by protecting him yet again. \n\nThe New York Times grows a spine\n\nThe New York Times is pushing back against the comically broad discovery demand issued by Trump in one of his numerous private lawsuits. This is the one where he wants $15 billion from the Times, alleging they defamed him by writing about him, essentially. How dare they.\n\nThis is the case where the court threw out Trump’s original complaint, an 85-page whine about all his grievances, including how he didn’t get enough credit for “The Apprentice.” Trump refiled a shorter complaint, one that the Times has moved to dismiss, pointing out that the new complaint still doesn’t meet the basic requirements of a defamation claim: identifying specific false statements of fact and why they are untrue. The Times also asked that, if the court won’t dismiss the case, it be transferred out of the Middle District of Florida because the allegations all relate to conduct that occurred in New York, where The New York Times is based. \n\nWhile the motions to dismiss are pending, Trump is desperately trying to keep the case in Florida, demanding that the Times cough up information on readership metrics, printing, warehousing, and more. Trump seems to think that if the Times sold enough newspapers in Florida, he gets to keep the case there. \n\nThe Times wants discovery stayed while the court rules on the motions to dismiss so that they’re not jammed up, providing burdensome reams of irrelevant sales material for a case that will get thrown out or moved to the correct venue. \n\nThe mere fact that Trump has tried to push these onerous discovery demands while those motions are pending makes it pretty clear that this is designed to harass the Times, which is all these broadsides against the media are really about. Well, that and getting those media companies to give him millions of dollars to “settle” these spurious claims. \n\nIs it good when a judge says your arguments are ‘futile’?\n\nBecause that’s what a federal judge just told the Trump administration about its attempt to keep recycling the same arguments about why it can withhold billions from sanctuary cities. \n\nThe administration has been fighting this tooth and nail since last February, arguing not just that his administration can defund sanctuary cities but can also punish local officials in sanctuary jurisdictions for obstructing justice. And the plaintiffs have won again and again, so much so that the judge on the case, William H. Orrick, sounds a wee bit exasperated that the administration keeps trotting out arguments it has already rejected. \n\nThe administration sought to get the case dismissed by arguing that a court can’t actually rule on its attempts to yank money from sanctuary jurisdictions, a move that very much did not work. \n\nNow, the plaintiffs can proceed with their lawsuit—well, until the next time the Department of Justice throws a monkey wrench in everything. \n\nThe whole administration works for Donald Trump, private citizen\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt had a revealing slip of the tongue when issuing a straight-up threat to CBS from her official government perch. \n\nAfter CBS taped a 13-minute interview with Trump as part of their overall efforts to suck up to him, Leavitt relayed to “CBS Evening News” anchor Tony Dokoupil that Trump said, “Make sure you guys don’t cut the tape, make sure the interview is out in full.” When Dokoupil said CBS was already planning to do that, Leavitt upped the ante: “He said, ‘If it’s not out in full, we’ll sue your ass off.”\n\nIn short, Leavitt used her official role to threaten a major network into bowing to Trump, or else get sued. \n\nTrump, of course, has already sued CBS over a similar complaint about the network editing an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris rather than running it in its entirety. CBS gave Trump a cool $16 million bribe to “settle” this with Trump, the private citizen.\n\nLeavitt’s remarks are a new frontier in lawlessness, however. She's either saying that the government itself will take official action against CBS if Trump doesn’t get his way, or she’s saying there is no real daylight between official Trump and private Trump, so his personal lawsuits are blessed by the administration. Both of these are very bad!","summary":"Injustice for All is a weekly series about how the Trump administration is trying to weaponize the justice system—and the people who are fighting back.\n\n\n\n\nThis week, we say goodbye to supposed U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, which is great, but we also say hello to Judge Aileen Cannon, which is very not great.

Executives or employees who have inside knowledge of a company’s plans or performance cannot use that information to gain a financial advantage. The Securities and Exchange Commission constantly polices markets for signs of insider trading.\n\nCurrently, though, similar protections do not exist for traders on prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi, which have grown massively in recent months and allow users to bet on the outcomes of events large and small, ranging from presidential elections and NFL games to specific words used in press conferences or the amount of snowfall in a given day in New York City.\n\nThe presence of insider trading in prediction markets could be seen as a feature, not a bug, by prediction market proponents who value the markets for their accuracy and their ability to reflect all the best knowledge available — whether that information is coming from insiders or not.\n\nBut in recent weeks, several high-profile instances of suspected insider dealing have raised complaints from officials and legislators who say they are worried about traders getting ripped off — or even about prediction markets creating incentives for insiders to change the course of events. Now, the prospect of regulation or legislation looms for prediction markets.\n\nRep. Richie Torres (D-NY) said that the report of the Maduro inside trade was the kick he needed to come forward with a bill designed to curb insider trading on such platforms by government officials and aides.\n\n“My team and I were thinking about it for a while, but the impetus was the anonymous trade,” Torres told the Washington Examiner during an interview.\n\nWhat are prediction markets?\n\nKalshi, Polymarket, and other prediction markets offer event contracts that allow users to wager on outcomes.\n\nPrediction markets began receiving major attention during the 2024 elections, during which President Donald Trump bested then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Many pollsters predicted that Harris had the edge or that it would be an exceedingly close contest, with some calling the race a coin flip.\n\nKalshi users, on the other hand, were implying notably higher odds of a Trump win than many pollsters were. And the prediction became reality after Trump secured a decisive victory and won every major swing state.\n\nThe idea behind prediction markets is relatively simple: Users can buy shares in possible outcomes for various events. Using the example of the presidential race, one share on that market would represent a “yes” for Trump winning, and another a “no.” The price of a yes results in $1 if Trump does indeed win, but goes to zero if he loses. If the price starts at 50 cents, that implies that he has a 50% chance of winning. Any user who thought Trump’s odds were better than that could buy a yes contract. If Trump then won, he would have gotten 50 cents for every contract he bought at 50 cents.\n\nInsider trading fears\n\nThe Maduro trades were quickly flagged as being suspicious given the timing and the top-secret nature of the operation in Venezuela. And this isn’t the first time that certain prediction market trades have raised red flags.\n\nIn October, Norwegian officials who are in charge of awarding the Nobel Peace Prize said they were investigating after Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado’s odds suddenly shot up hours before her win was announced.\n\n“We take this very seriously,” Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, told Bloomberg at the time. “It seems we have been prey to a criminal actor who wants to earn money on our information.”\n\nIn December, a user on Polymarket raked in over $1 million in 24 hours by placing bets on Google’s 2025 Year in Search rankings, which many saw as suspiciously correct.\n\n“We’ve had many reports of suspicions over the last few months of such things,” Robin Hanson, a professor at George Mason University and an expert on prediction markets, told the Washington Examiner.\n\nHanson said that, fundamentally, the concerns about insider trading on these platforms come down to people and organizations and their ability to keep secrets.\n\nIt is also true that prediction markets do their own policing of insider trading on their platforms, said Todd Phillips, assistant professor of law in the Robinson College of Business at Georgia State University and former attorney for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n\n“There are rules in place that these markets have to have their own anti-manipulation rules and surveillance happening, and so I think it’s fair to say that they do try very hard to prevent manipulation and insider trading, kind of the same way that we try to prevent insider trading on stock markets,” Phillips said.\n\nHe said that if the platforms find someone engaging in manipulation, they can give that information to government authorities.\n\nStill, Ilya Belyin, a law professor at Seton Hall Law School, said there is little information out there about the extent of self-regulation, at least on Polymarket, where the Maduro trades were executed.\n\n“We have not seen Polymarket rigorously enforce its rules, so we really don’t know about self-regulation in this area, but it seems to be weak,” Belyin told the Washington Examiner.\n\nBut what regulation is there\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission is the government agency tasked with regulating prediction markets. \n\nThe CFTC oversees markets where people trade derivatives, or contracts tied to prices, for instance, for commodities such as oil or wheat. But prediction markets with event contracts also fall under the CFTC’s purview, so as those markets continue to proliferate, the CFTC will be the agency that looks into accusations of insider trading.\n\nIn 2020, the CFTC issued Kalshi regulatory approval, making it the first fully regulated financial exchange for event contracts. But the other prediction market behemoth, Polymarket, has its main exchange operating internationally.\n\n“The Maduro event contracts were traded on offshore, unregulated exchanges, so that contract was not listed on anything that is regulated by U.S. regulators,” Phillips told the Washington Examiner.\n\nIt is an open question of how aggressive the CFTC under Trump will be in regulating these prediction markets.\n\nCFTC Chairman Michael Selig acknowledged the growth of prediction markets in an op-ed this week, saying that U.S. financial markets “are ready for a golden age.”\n\n“As new asset classes emerge and the CFTC’s role evolves, guidelines we establish should not just fit the product, but also serve a tailored regulatory purpose,” Selig said. “Prediction markets have exploded in popularity as broad swaths of market participants seek to hedge portfolio risks and test their abilities to forecast truth.”\n\nBut Belyin said he is skeptical about CFTC enforcement with event contracts, in part, because of how new it all is and because the CFTC doesn’t have much of a history of enforcement related to event contracts.\n\nA CFTC spokesperson told the Washington Examiner that Selig is “committed to promoting market integrity and investor protection in markets within the CFTC’s regulatory jurisdiction.”\n\n“As he said during his confirmation hearing, he will engage with a broad array of stakeholders and policymakers to make informed decisions about the agency’s role in regulating emerging markets,” the spokesperson added. “This will necessarily require thoughtful consideration of very complex and evolving legal and policy issues.”\n\nPossible legislation?\n\nSome on Capitol Hill are pushing to crack down on the possibility of insider trading in prediction markets.\n\nThe Torres legislation, the Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026, has attracted 39 Democratic cosponsors so far.\n\nThe bill would specifically bar lawmakers, political appointees, executive branch employees, and congressional aides from trading prediction market contracts “tied to government policy, government action, or political outcomes when they possess material nonpublic information or could reasonably obtain such information through their official duties,” according to his office.\n\nTorres told the Washington Examiner that the prediction markets could facilitate corruption at the highest levels.\n\n“If you’re both a government insider and a participant in the prediction market, you now have a perverse incentive to push for policies that will line your pockets, and that kind of self-dealing is the very definition of corruption,” Torres said.\n\nTRUMP FLOATS OVERHAUL OF TAX RULES TO CRACK DOWN ON INSTITUTIONAL HOMEBUYERS\n\nNotably, Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour came out in support of the Torres legislation, drawing a distinction between his platform and other unregulated offshore platforms.\n\n“Kalshi is supportive of the bill Ritchie Torres is looking to introduce to affirm the ban on insider trading on prediction markets,” Mansour said. “Why? Because we already implement it. However, it’s important to emphasize that this American bill only applies to regulated, American companies and not to unregulated, non-American companies, which is where the alleged issues are occurring.”","summary":"In&#160;Focus&#160;delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

Wesley Hunt, R-Texas.\n\n“In 2020, the Census Bureau undercounted in primarily deep-red states like Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas, all red, while overcounting in radical blue states like Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, and Rhode Island,” Hunt told a Nov. 19, 2025, hearing of the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on the Constitution and Limited Government.\n\n“This egregious error led to many states being denied proper representation in Congress and the Electoral College. So much so that these errors costs Republicans … six seats in the House. In addition to the 2020 miscounting, including illegal immigrants in the census has improperly granted radical Left blue states 12 additional seats in the United States House of Representatives. That is a total of 18 seats gain and that is a huge problem. And those are the facts,” Hunt told the hearing.\n\nThe Census Bureau acknowledged the overcounts and the undercounts in a May 2025 report. The Census Bureau uses its population counts as the basis for determining how many House of Representatives seats are in each of the 50 states. The census counts all present individuals without distinguishing between citizens and noncitizens, meaning a higher head count gives a state more House seats, without regard to citizenship status.\n\nIt is illegal for noncitizens to vote in all federal elections, as well as the vast majority of state and local contests.\n\nNot all of the undercounted states were red, as deep-blue Illinois was among this group, while not all of the overcounted states were blue. Ohio and Utah, both red states, were among the over-counted group, according to the census report.\n\nMost congressional Republicans, like Hunt, support requiring Census Bureau counters to at least include a question about the citizenship of every counted individual, while most congressional Democrats oppose such a requirement. The issue has intensified in recent years, especially during the Biden administration’s open-border era in which millions of illegal immigrants crossed into the U.S.\n\nLegislation originally introduced in the House of Representatives in 2025 by Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas—the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act—requires proof of citizenship when registering to vote and provides criminal penalties for violations. The measure, which has 110 House co-sponsors, including Hunt, passed the lower chamber but has not been acted upon by the Senate. President Donald Trump supports the measure.\n\nHunt did not address the issue of whether political bias within the Census Bureau’s workforce could be a factor in the significant undercounting and overcounting, but The Washington Stand’s review of Federal Election Commission campaign contribution data for the years 2023, 2024, and 2025 found a huge bias in favor of Democrats among donors who said they work for the agency.\n\nDuring the three years indicated, the FEC records disclosed 4,037 contributions by individuals who listed “U.S. Census Bureau” as their employer. Of those contributions, 3,583 went to Democrats, compared to 455 made to Republicans, for a 7-1 ratio. The average Democrat contribution was for $29, while the average Republican contribution was $229.\n\nInterestingly, the total dollar value of the contributions by Census Bureau workers to Democrats was $104,597, only slightly more than the $104,130 total given to Republicans.\n\nFederal workers like those at the Census Bureau are covered by the Hatch Act, which bars partisan political activities by government employees while on official duty. The Hatch Act does not limit the right of government employees to work for candidates while off-duty, to contribute to the candidates of their choice, or to participate in activities supporting candidates, as long as federal property is not used in the process.\n\nTwo-thirds of the Democratic contributions, or 1,999 of the 3,582 total, were given through ActBlue, a digital site that acts as a conduit for campaign funding from individuals to favored candidates. WinRed, the similar digital site created by Republicans to counter ActBlue, accounted for only 253 contributions to GOP candidates by Census Bureau workers.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris, the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, received 347 contributions from Census workers, compared to just 69 for Trump, her 2024 Republican rival.\n\nApprised of the Census Bureau employee contribution bias, Hunt provided the following statement to The Washington Stand:\n\n“The inaccuracies and deliberate manipulations embedded in Democrat-led Census reporting expose a level of corruption that plagued the previous administration and continues today under radical Left leadership. Despite these efforts, the American people saw through the deception and delivered a decisive victory for Donald Trump in the last election.\n\n“Now, with Republicans holding all three chambers of government, we have both the responsibility and the obligation to correct these abuses immediately and restore integrity to the process by ensuring that Census data reflects only United States citizens.\n\n“The irony is unmistakable. For years, Democrats have warned of a supposed threat to democracy, while actively engaging in the very practices that undermine it—manipulating systems designed to distort representation and influence elections. Democracy is not endangered by transparency and lawful governance. It is endangered by those who abuse institutions for political gain.”\n\nHunt will not be in the House of Representatives in 2027, as he is seeking the Republican nomination for the Senate in a hotly contested primary that also includes Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and the Lone Star State’s long-serving incumbent, Sen. John Cornyn. The primary election is March 3, 2026.\n\nOriginally published by The Washington Stand","summary":"Undercounting the population in red states like Texas and Florida in 2020 cost Republicans at least six seats in the House of Representatives, while overcounting...

The strategy, signed by War Secretary Pete Hegseth, emphasizes an approach of ‘peace through strength’, rebuilding US military power and prioritizing what it defines as direct American interests, alongside a demand that Washington’s allies shoulder a greater share of the burden. Israel is described as a ‘model ally’. The roughly 34-page document portrays the global security environment prior to Trump’s return to the White House in January 2025 as ‘one of the most dangerous in American history’, a pointed jab at former president Joe Biden and his administration. It sets out four main lines of effort: defending the homeland, deterring China in the Indo-Pacific, increasing burden sharing with allies and revitalizing the American defense industrial base. In contrast to the previous administration led by Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, which the document says ‘tied Israel’s hands’, the new strategy offers unusually strong praise for Israel, repeatedly defining it as a ‘model ally’. Israel is mentioned no fewer than 10 times. Among other passages, the document states: ‘In the Middle East, Israel has proven that it is willing and able to defend itself after the barbaric attacks of October 7. In short, it is a model ally. Yet instead of empowering Israel, the previous administration tied its hands.’ Later, in a section dealing with Iran and the Middle East, amid ongoing tensions and the possibility that Trump could order a strike on the Islamic republic, the strategy adds: ‘Israel has long demonstrated that it is willing and able to defend itself with critical but limited support from the United States. Israel is a model ally, and we now have an opportunity to further empower it to defend itself and advance our shared interests, building on President Trump’s historic efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East.’ The document notes that Israel received critical US support during the ‘12-day war’ with Iran and that American forces helped Israel achieve what it describes as historic operational and strategic successes. It adds that Israeli actions severely damaged Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis, while the United States conducted its own operation against the Houthis from March through May last year, Operation ‘Rough Rider’, aimed at restoring freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. Under the section detailing the war department’s missions, the strategy states: ‘The department will encourage regional allies and partners to take primary responsibility for deterring and defending against Iran and its proxies, including through strong support for Israel’s efforts to defend itself, deepening cooperation with our partners in the Arab Gulf and enabling integration between Israel and our Gulf partners, building on President Trump’s historic initiative, the Abraham Accords.’ The strategy places a renewed focus on homeland defense, including protection of US borders, the Panama Canal, Greenland and efforts to combat drug smuggling. It also reiterates deterrence against China and calls on allies to raise defense spending to 5 percent of gross domestic product, including 3.5 percent for military forces and 1.5 percent for broader security needs. In Europe, NATO allies are expected to bear primary responsibility for confronting Russia, including support for Ukraine. On the Korean Peninsula, South Korea is tasked with leading the effort against North Korea. The Middle East, including Israel, is presented as a region where ‘local partners can and should do more’. The document highlights major operations as key elements of deterrence, including Operation ‘Midnight Hammer’, the June strike that destroyed Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan, Operation ‘Absolute Resolve’ to capture Venezuelan ruler Nicolas Maduro, and Operation ‘Rough Rider’ in Yemen. Overall, the new defense strategy reflects what it calls a ‘hardnosed realism’ under the banner of ‘America First’, Trump’s campaign slogan, while rejecting what it describes as the ‘utopian idealism’ of previous administrations. It pledges that the US military will serve as the president’s ‘sword and shield’ in pursuit of lasting peace, while remaining ready to win any war if required.","summary":"The US war department publishes President Trump’s 2026 National Defense Strategy, stressing deterrence against China, higher burden sharing by allies, border and asset protection and a rebuilt defense industry while praising Israel’s conduct after October 7","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1tarkf8be","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/05/15/HJ87GKQbgl/HJ87GKQbgl_0_0_3000_2000_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 18:17:15","author":"Itamar Eichner","authors":["Itamar Eichner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":0.022},{"id":395725406,"title":"US federal agents shoot and kill man in Minneapolis","text":"A man who was shot on Saturday by US federal immigration officers in Minneapolis has died, a hospital record shows.\n\nThe shooting comes less than three weeks after Renee Good, an American citizen, was shot and killed by a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officer in Minneapolis while she was driving away from a confrontation, sparking protests nationwide.\n\nThe hospital record was obtained by the Associated Press. The man’s death was also reported by CNN, citing the city’s police chief.\n\nThe US department of homeland security distributed a photo of a handgun they said was on the person who was shot.\n\nAfter the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and screamed profanities at federal officers, calling them “cowards” and telling them to go home.\n\nOne officer responded mockingly as he walked away, telling them: “Boo hoo.” Agents elsewhere shoved a yelling protester into a car.\n\nCity officials said in their statement that the “shooting involving federal law enforcement” occurred in the area of West 26th Street and Nicollet Avenue South – and that they are “working to confirm additional details”.\n\n“We ask the public to remain calm and avoid the immediate area,” the statement added.\n\nA law enforcement source directly briefed on the situation provided the Guardian with a photo of a handgun next to a loaded magazine. “Suspect had a firearm with two magazines,” the source said. “Situation evolving. Will get ... more information ASAP.”\n\nMinnesota’s governor, Tim Walz, added in a statement shortly afterward that he has spoken with the White House “after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning”.\n\n“Minnesota has had it,” said Mr Walz, who was Kamala Harris’s running mate in the 2024 presidential election that she lost to Donald Trump. “This is sickening.”\n\n“The president must end this operation,” Walz also said, referring to the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration enforcement operation in the state.\n\n“Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota,” he added. “Now.”\n\nThe Minneapolis police department and the US department of homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday.\n\nA video circulating online, which matches the reported location of the shooting mentioned by the officials, shows a man being wrestled to the ground by several law enforcement officers before being shot, what appears to be, several times. At least two officers can be seen with their weapons drawn.\n\nLive video of the scene after the shooting shows dozens of federal agents surrounding the scene, deploying what appears to be chemical irritants into the crowd of people that have gathered in the streets where the shooting occurred. People are yelling at agents, honking horns and recording.\n\nBill Melugin of Fox News, which is generally aligned with the Trump administration, quickly reported on Saturday that he was told by “multiple law enforcement sources” that border patrol was the agency involved in the shooting. Mr Melugin reported being told the person is “down”, and medics were working on the person. \n\nOn Friday, thousands of demonstrators braved bitter cold to march through the streets of Minneapolis demanding an end to Mr Trump’s immigration crackdown in their city, part of a wider “ICE OUT!” show of defiance that organisers billed as a general strike.\n\nOn a day that started with temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees, organisers said as many as 50,000 people took to the streets, a figure that Reuters could not verify, as Minneapolis police did not respond to a request for a crowd estimate. Many demonstrators later gathered indoors at the Target Center, a sports arena with a capacity of 20,000 that was more than half full.\n\nOrganisers and participants said scores of businesses across Minnesota closed for the day and workers headed to street protests and marches, which followed weeks of sometimes violent confrontations between Ice agents and protesters opposed to Mr Trump’s surge.\n\nJust a day earlier, US vice-president JD Vance visited Minneapolis in a demonstration of support for Ice officers and to ask local leaders and activists to reduce tensions, saying Ice was carrying out an important mission to detain immigration violators.\n\nIn one of the more dramatic protests, local police arrested dozens of clergy members who sang hymns and prayed as they knelt on a road at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport in calling for Trump to withdraw the 3,000 federal law enforcement officers sent to the area. – Agencies","summary":"Second incident comes after Renee Good was shot and killed by an Ice agent in the US city earlier in January","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/2026/01/24/us-federal-agents-shoot-another-person-in-minneapolis-says-governor-tim-walz/","image":"https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/5KYPW2DYBGRGFPXOF7D3ZYYD2A.jpg?auth=e538361535ff2e207d4098be96556ce1c1a14987f89e65e71d97a6dc8acd3f9f&smart=true&width=1600&height=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 17:38:26","author":"Sat Jan 24 2026 - 17:38","authors":["Sat Jan 24 2026 - 17:38"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.384},{"id":395709926,"title":"James Carville’s On-Air Meltdown Is Hard to Watch","text":"James Carville was known as a sharp political mind until President Donald Trump broke him. He’s gone so far off the rails that it really makes no sense why anyone even bothers to get his take on current events. He confidently predicted — guaranteed, really — that Kamala Harris would win the 2024 election. He couldn’t separate his personal bias from reality, and wound up with egg on his face. He’s not sought after for his honest insight; he’s sought after because his reputation is being exploited to make leftists feel better when they’re told what they want to hear.\n\nCarville appeared on The Beat with Ari Melber on MSNOW Friday night, and quickly made clear he was in no mood for restraint. Melber introduced him as a “legendary Democratic strategist” and asked a straightforward question about the week’s polling and protests. What followed sounded like a man who has completely lost his grip on reality.\n\nCarville immediately launched into a bizarre tirade about President Trump, Davos, and social media, and it was so crazy, I kept waiting for orderlies in white shirts to come get him.\n\n“Well, let’s talk about Trump at Davos and his midnight nocturnal tweets,” Carville said. “He’s a flea-bitten dog baying at the moon. Okay, I apologize, kennel clubs and dog lovers. I don’t mean to drag the reputation of flea-bitten dogs through the mud, but it’s the best metaphor I can come up with,” he said. “He’s just howling and howling and howling, and you can’t reason with him. Oh, dear, that’s 200 and, you know, 38,855 miles away. It can’t hurt you. It’s orbiting the Earth, and Earth orbits the sun,” he said, before concluding, “You’re talking to a flea-bitten dog.”\n\nICYMI: Sen. Kennedy Schools Bill Maher, and I Bet He Hated That\n\nI haven’t even gotten to the craziest part yet. The real moment that revealed just how far off the rails he has gone came when he turned to Republicans planning a mini-convention for the midterms.\n\nAccording to Carville, this was not a routine political gathering or campaign stop. It was something far darker.\n\n“And the big news, and if you look at your story in Minneapolis, the Republicans are… claiming they’re gonna have a midterm mini-convention with Trump attending,” Carville said. “They’re gonna go to Minneapolis, and he’s gonna try to provoke a race war.”\n\nYes, a race war. On national television. Without evidence. Without specifics. Without any grounding in reality.\n\n\"Listen to me,\" he added. \"This summer, the Republicans will go to Minneapolis. He's going to try to provoke a race war... he's going to go to Minneapolis to try to provoke these people in all over, and it's going to be summertime, and the weather's going to be good. And it's, it's — he's trying to create a race war. I don't think he will succeed, because I don't think people will take the bait. But they'd better be warned. I'm serious.\"\n\nHe emphasized that point again for good measure.\n\n“I, I’m really serious when I put these two events together,” he said.\n\nThis is why Carville can’t be taken seriously anymore. He’s given up the pretense of offering political analysis and selling his paranoid meltdown as legitimate insight. He projected onto Trump the very racial chaos Democrats have spent years excusing and fomenting. It’s only been five years since the riots that left parts of Minneapolis smoldering. In Carville’s warped telling, every Trump rally is a looming catastrophe, every Republican gathering a provocation, and every expression of free speech an existential threat.\n\nThere was once a time when Democrat consultants were sane and had insightful things to say that you could actually learn from, even if you disagreed with their politics. I miss those days.\n\nCarville’s talk of a looming “race war” that the GOP would start bordered on delusion, and his suggestion that Trump would deploy the military to inflame racial violence reeks of paranoid schizophrenia, not reasoned political insight from a seasoned political consultant. He deserves a straitjacket, not a national audience.\n\nWant to support fearless journalism that exposes the left and tells the stories the media won’t?

The British pop star, whose sixth studio album became a cultural and commercial phenomenon synonymous with an attitude of spiky independence in 2024, is moving on to a new passion: film. And she has unofficially launched her new chapter here at the Sundance Film Festival with “The Moment.” The A24 film, directed by Aidan Zamiri and co-written by Zamiri and Bertie Brandes, is a satire about Charli’s life at the height of her fame, at the end of “brat summer” in 2024 as she was preparing to embark on her first arena tour. The movie, which will open in theaters Jan. 30, stars Charli as herself, Alexander Skarsgård as a pompous director trying to take over her tour and Rosanna Arquette as a steely record label head, and it includes cameos from stars like Kylie Jenner, Julia Fox and Rachel Sennott. “Right now, unlike the me in the film, I am sort of like really wanting ‘brat’ to stop and actually pivot, like as far away as possible,” Charli said from the stage of Sundance’s 2,500-seat Eccles Theatre. “And that’s not because I don’t love it. It’s just because I think for all of us as artists, you want to challenge yourself and … totally switch the creative soup that you’re in and go and live in a different bowl for a while and feel enriched by that.” Charli is definitely entering new creative territory in 2026. In addition to “The Moment,” she has acting roles in two other films at Sundance, Gregg Araki’s “I Want Your Sex,” in which she plays a character who fakes an orgasm with Cooper Hoffman, and an art world satire called “The Gallerist” with Natalie Portman and Zach Galifianakis, which premieres Saturday night. “They call it XCX Dance I hear,” Zamiri joked onstage when festival director Eugene Hernandez mentioned Charli’s diverse slate. She also wrote the soundtrack for the new Warner Bros. film “Wuthering Heights,” starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, which opens Feb. 13. “The Moment,” however, is the project that showcases Charli front and center. The artist previously described a brat as someone who likes to party, “says some dumb things sometimes” and is “honest, blunt and a little bit volatile.” After the release of “brat,” the album became an aesthetic, with its signature green color and typeface turning up in memes and even in messaging from the Kamala Harris campaign. In the film, the once-underground club artist is seen feeling disoriented by her new mainstream success and barraged by people who want to capitalize on it in questionable ways. She gets all kinds of advice, including from Jenner, who suggests, “The second you think people are getting sick of you, that’s when you have to go even harder.” “I think I am, as an artist, quite a volatile person,” Charli said onstage after the premiere. “And nice, though. I am quite nice too … right? But having been in the music industry since I was 16, it’s like I’ve gone through various different stages in my career where I’ve felt on top of the world or felt like absolute s---. ... For me, I’ve had a lot of practice reacting to all of those different characters in my real life, so I think I was drawing from that really.” The filmmakers said an inspiration for the movie’s tone was the late Rob Reiner’s 1984 mockumentary “This Is Spinal Tap.” Still, if Charli is ready to close the “brat” chapter, her fans may be harder to convince. Ticket holders and festival volunteers lined up outside the theater in the snow on Friday night wearing lime-green beanies — a promotional item from the film — and holding copies of the album. “I feel like she has been big for a while, but not as popular as she deserves,” said Hibba Ahmed, 21, from Salt Lake City. “I love her confidence. … The brand that she’s built people are so easily able to recognize and identify with,” said Gabrielle Held, 23, a production assistant from Atlanta. “It can be interpreted in so many different ways, and everybody can enjoy it for different reasons.” When asked whether they are ready to say goodbye to “brat,” some fans in line said they are on board for whatever Charli’s evolution may involve. “She said she wants to get into film. She wrote a lot about it in her Substack,” said Emma Roth-Wells, 23, who lives in Salt Lake City, adding that it’s “exciting.” “I do hope she also continues her music.” At the movie’s after-party, police on horseback forcefully pushed people away from the crowded door at the Premiere lounge on Main Street, where partygoers on the list were given brat-green wristbands to enter. Inside, as a DJ spun Rihanna, the Verve and, yes, Charli XCX, bartenders served cocktails in Poppi soda cans branded with “The Moment.” Among the attendees were stars from Charli’s other film that premiered that night, “I Want Your Sex,” including Hoffman and Chase Sui Wonders, as well as local celebrity John Barlow, the husband of “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City’s” Lisa Barlow, the self-anointed queen of Sundance. Charli’s moment at Sundance continues on Saturday, where she is expected to appear at a TikTok panel and where audiences will get their first look at “The Gallerist.” She is attending the festival in a particularly significant year, its last in Park City before moving to Boulder, Colorado, in 2027 and its first since the death of its founder, Robert Redford. Though Charli may seem ubiquitous in Park City this year, not everyone at Sundance, an event that draws cinephiles from all corners of culture, was aware of her. In a line for a panel on environmental films Friday afternoon, one attendee mentioned that night’s upcoming “The Moment” premiere to his friends. “Who’s Charli XCX?” one friend asked. “Remember ‘brat summer’?” he said. “Vaguely,” she replied. At least in that Sundance line, when it comes to moving on from brat, Charli may already be getting her wish.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/charli-xcx-sundance-film-festival-the-moment-brat-rcna255483","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260124-charli-xcx-mn-1025-44cac4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 17:15:26","author":"Rebecca Keegan","authors":["Rebecca Keegan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.392},{"id":395749282,"title":"Susan Shelley: Gavin Newsom grandstands and flops at Davos","text":"Gov. Gavin Newsom is back from his all-expense-paid trip to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum. Guess who paid for it.\n\nEvery special interest in California.\n\nKCRA in Sacramento reported that the cost of this trip, like all the governor's official travel, was paid by the California State Protocol Foundation. The mission of the foundation is \"to lessen the burden on California taxpayers by relieving California of its obligations to fund certain expenditures.\"\n\nThat's how it's described in the publicly available behested payment reports that Gov. Newsom filed, as required, with the Fair Political Practices Commission. The FPPC explains on its website that a behested payment is not a gift or a campaign contribution, but a payment made \"at the request, suggestion, or solicitation of, or made in cooperation, consultation, coordination, or concert with the public official.\"\n\nThat explanation can be shortened to just one word: \"shakedown.\"\n\nUnlike donations to a campaign committee or PAC, behested payments have no contribution limit. The only limitation is that the payments must be for a \"legislative, governmental or charitable purpose.\" Payments totaling $5,000 or more in a calendar year from a single source must be reported within 30 days.\n\nBehested payments have funded the California State Protocol Foundation. In 2025, Newsom “behested” a payment of $220,000 from the University of California Berkeley for the \"charitable\" purpose of paying the costs of attending the Vatican climate summit. He \"behested\" the U.S. Energy Foundation out of $150,000 to pay for his \"delegation\" to the COP30 climate change conference in Brazil, also described as a \"charitable\" purpose.\n\nNewsom hit up Zoox, Inc., an autonomous vehicle subsidiary of Amazon, and Centene Management Company, LLC, of St. Louis, “a leading provider of government-sponsored healthcare,” for $25,000 each \"in support of general operations\" of the Protocol Foundation.\n\nBut the largest behested payments came from Newsom's own inaugural committees. The \"2023 Governor's Inaugural Fund\" paid the California State Protocol Foundation a total of $2 million in 2023 and 2024. The \"Governor's Inaugural Fund 2019\" paid $700,000 in April 2019 and $2,436,317 in May 2020.\n\nThe reports of behested payments to the inaugural committees reveal who was on the receiving end of a “request, suggestion or solicitation” from the newly elected or re-elected governor.\n\nEverybody. Indian tribes, apartment associations, beverage companies, health care and hospital companies, the carpenters' union, the nurses' union, the teachers' union, the firefighters' union, the prison guards’ union, AT&T, Amazon, Uber, the service employees, the electrical workers, the pipe trades council, the building industry association, the operating engineers, the professional engineers, the charter schools, the aircraft manufacturers and many, many more.\n\nAbout $5.1 million of the roughly $8.8 million that Newsom asked special interests to pay for the \"governmental\" purpose of inaugural events ended up transferred to the Protocol Foundation, where it is used to prop up the governor on the world stage as he emotes for cameras about climate change and complains that not enough has been done to stop Donald Trump.\n\nNot enough? Jack Smith, Letitia James, Alvin Bragg, Fani Willis, Hillary Clinton, the January 6th Committee, two sets of impeachment prosecutors and whoever allowed that sniper on the roof in Butler must be wondering what it takes to impress Gavin Newsom.\n\nDemocratic political analyst and former Obama advisor David Axelrod wrote in an online post that he was finding Newsom's \"’Why can't people just be as courageous as ME?' routine\" to be \"tedious.\"\n\nIt was certainly predictable. Before Newsom left California for Davos, his office was telling reporters that he would present California as an alternative to the Trump administration, \"a beacon of stability and loyalty.\"\n\nWhat does that even mean? Are we going to defend Europe with $6 billion in carbon credits and a third of a bullet train?\n\nWhen he got off the plane in Davos, Newsom was a regular insult comic. He told reporters that U.S. allies were \"pathetic\" for not standing up to Trump. He said the president \"is a T-rex – you mate with him or he devours you.\" He waved around knee pads to show contempt for leaders he views as being on their knees to Trump.\n\nAsked about Newsom's criticisms, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent went full Don Rickles. Opening with, \"Governor Newsom, who strikes me as Patrick Bateman meets Sparkle Beach Ken,\" Bessent went on to roast Newsom as \"the only Californian who knows less about economics than Kamala Harris.\" He got in a dig about Newsom's \"billionaire sugar daddy, Alex Soros\" and worked in the \"$1,000-a-night meals at the French Laundry\" during the COVID lockdown.\n\nRickles might have paid a lot for that \"American Psycho\" meets \"Barbie\" joke. But Bessent was probably not joking when he said this: \"My message to Governor Newsom is the Trump administration is coming to California.

Gavin Newsom is back from his all-expense-paid trip to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum. Guess who paid for it.\n\nEvery special interest in California.\n\nKCRA in Sacramento reported that the cost of this trip, like all the governor’s official travel, was paid by the California State Protocol Foundation. The mission of the foundation is “to lessen the burden on California taxpayers by relieving California of its obligations to fund certain expenditures.”\n\nThat’s how it’s described in the publicly available behested payment reports that Gov. Newsom filed, as required, with the Fair Political Practices Commission. The FPPC explains on its website that a behested payment is not a gift or a campaign contribution, but a payment made “at the request, suggestion, or solicitation of, or made in cooperation, consultation, coordination, or concert with the public official.”\n\nThat explanation can be shortened to just one word: “shakedown.”\n\nUnlike donations to a campaign committee or PAC, behested payments have no contribution limit. The only limitation is that the payments must be for a “legislative, governmental or charitable purpose.” Payments totaling $5,000 or more in a calendar year from a single source must be reported within 30 days.\n\nBehested payments have funded the California State Protocol Foundation. In 2025, Newsom “behested” a payment of $220,000 from the University of California Berkeley for the “charitable” purpose of paying the costs of attending the Vatican climate summit. He “behested” the U.S. Energy Foundation out of $150,000 to pay for his “delegation” to the COP30 climate change conference in Brazil, also described as a “charitable” purpose.\n\nNewsom hit up Zoox, Inc., an autonomous vehicle subsidiary of Amazon, and Centene Management Company, LLC, of St. Louis, “a leading provider of government-sponsored healthcare,” for $25,000 each “in support of general operations” of the Protocol Foundation.\n\nBut the largest behested payments came from Newsom’s own inaugural committees. The “2023 Governor’s Inaugural Fund” paid the California State Protocol Foundation a total of $2 million in 2023 and 2024. The “Governor’s Inaugural Fund 2019” paid $700,000 in April 2019 and $2,436,317 in May 2020.\n\nThe reports of behested payments to the inaugural committees reveal who was on the receiving end of a “request, suggestion or solicitation” from the newly elected or re-elected governor.\n\nEverybody. Indian tribes, apartment associations, beverage companies, health care and hospital companies, the carpenters’ union, the nurses’ union, the teachers’ union, the firefighters’ union, the prison guards’ union, AT&T, Amazon, Uber, the service employees, the electrical workers, the pipe trades council, the building industry association, the operating engineers, the professional engineers, the charter schools, the aircraft manufacturers and many, many more.\n\nAbout $5.1 million of the roughly $8.8 million that Newsom asked special interests to pay for the “governmental” purpose of inaugural events ended up transferred to the Protocol Foundation, where it is used to prop up the governor on the world stage as he emotes for cameras about climate change and complains that not enough has been done to stop Donald Trump.\n\nNot enough? Jack Smith, Letitia James, Alvin Bragg, Fani Willis, Hillary Clinton, the January 6th Committee, two sets of impeachment prosecutors and whoever allowed that sniper on the roof in Butler must be wondering what it takes to impress Gavin Newsom.\n\nDemocratic political analyst and former Obama advisor David Axelrod wrote in an online post that he was finding Newsom’s “’Why can’t people just be as courageous as ME?’ routine” to be “tedious.”\n\nIt was certainly predictable. Before Newsom left California for Davos, his office was telling reporters that he would present California as an alternative to the Trump administration, “a beacon of stability and loyalty.”\n\nWhat does that even mean? Are we going to defend Europe with $6 billion in carbon credits and a third of a bullet train?\n\nWhen he got off the plane in Davos, Newsom was a regular insult comic. He told reporters that U.S. allies were “pathetic” for not standing up to Trump. He said the president “is a T-rex – you mate with him or he devours you.” He waved around knee pads to show contempt for leaders he views as being on their knees to Trump.\n\nAsked about Newsom’s criticisms, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent went full Don Rickles. Opening with, “Governor Newsom, who strikes me as Patrick Bateman meets Sparkle Beach Ken,” Bessent went on to roast Newsom as “the only Californian who knows less about economics than Kamala Harris.” He got in a dig about Newsom’s “billionaire sugar daddy, Alex Soros” and worked in the “$1,000-a-night meals at the French Laundry” during the COVID lockdown.\n\nRickles might have paid a lot for that “American Psycho” meets “Barbie” joke. But Bessent was probably not joking when he said this: “My message to Governor Newsom is the Trump administration is coming to California. We are going to crack down on waste, fraud and abuse.”\n\nNewsom had been scheduled to speak at an event connected to the World Economic Forum, but somehow he was canceled, missing out on a high-profile opportunity to claim that his state is leading the world on climate change.\n\nIf Newsom had dreams of flying to Davos and being praised by world leaders as an alternative to Trump who is both superior and inevitable, the Trump team acidly crushed them. “No one in Davos knows who third-rate governor Newscum is or why he is frolicking around Switzerland instead of fixing the many problems he created in California,” a White House spokesperson said.\n\nBut all is not lost for the governor.

Liam was reportedly apprehended by ICE agents in his suburban Minneapolis driveway as he returned home from school. Agents are accused of walking the kindergartner to the door of his home and allegedly demanded to know who was inside. When Liam’s father came to the door, he was reportedly detained. \n\nAn adult in the home reportedly begged officers to leave Liam behind, per ABC 7. Instead, ICE agents reportedly placed both the child and his father into their vehicles and took them away. \n\nIf this were an example of ICE apprehending a violent or dangerous criminal, the administration might attempt to justify the means. \n\nNeighbors said that federal immigration officers used the toddler as “bait” by telling him to knock on the door to his house so that his parents would answer, but the Department of Homeland Security called those claims an “abject lie.” It claimed his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, allegedly fled on foot and “abandoned” the boy in a running car in their driveway, the Associated Press reported.\n\nAccording to Zena Stenvik, superintendent of the Columbia Heights school district Liam attends, that is not the case. She stated publicly that Liam’s father has an active asylum case, no deportation order and no criminal record. “I have viewed the legal paperwork with my own eyes,” she claimed. Leading many folks to believe Liam was not rescued from danger, but he was leveraged.\n\nSchool district staff reportedly later arrived at the home to support Liam’s older brother, a middle schooler, who returned from school to find his father and younger sibling gone. This should have been a moment for national reflection. Instead, it became another exercise in political distortion.\n\nAt a press conference, Vice President JD Vance spoke out about the incident, some say in an attempt to reframe the incident. “I’m a father of a five-year-old little boy,” he began, before insisting that ICE did not arrest a child, but rather detained a father who allegedly fled. “What are they supposed to do? Let the child freeze to death?,” he asked.\n\nThis framing does what it always does. It vilifies the victim, absolves the system and asks the public to accept cruelty as necessity. \n\nContrast Vance’s response with a statement from Kamala Harris: “Liam Ramos is just a baby. He should be at home with his family, not used as bait by ICE and held in a Texas detention center. I am outraged, and you should be too.”\n\nThis is the line in the sand. When the state allegedly begins to use children as leverage, the debate is no longer about policy. It is about humanity.\n\nWe cannot allow ourselves to become numb to this. Not when it is children. Not when it is families. Not when it is happening in our neighborhoods. No amount of spin can make this acceptable. And no society that claims to value human dignity should tolerate it.","summary":"When ICE agents allegedly begins to use children as leverage, the debate is no longer about policy.

Then, arriving at Joint Base Andrews, Joe Biden offered farewell remarks to his loyal staff. “We’re leaving office,” he said, “We’re not leaving the fight.”\n\nBut, one year later, Washington, and the world, have mostly moved on from the 46th president. Biden, 83, has been writing a lucrative memoir, planning a presidential library and fighting prostate cancer. He was once the most powerful man on the planet, but now Biden’s public appearances have been scarce and his influence has palpably diminished.\n\nChris Whipple, an author of books including The Fight of His Life: Inside Joe Biden’s White House, said: “He’s been the invisible man. He’s been very smart to stay under the radar because the last thing the Democratic party needs is any reminders of his final year in office, his ill-starred 11th-hour abdication and the resulting defeat of Kamala Harris.”\n\nFormer presidents have by tradition tended to keep a low profile out of respect for the office, giving their successors time and space to find their feet and make the Oval Office their own. Trump, as ever, was an outlier as he continued to lambast Biden and falsely claim the 2020 election had been stolen during his political exile.\n\nBiden, who surprised many with the scale and ambition of his legislative agenda during the first two years of his presidency, saw his opinion poll numbers sag as he neared the end of his term. A disastrous debate performance against Trump fuelled concerns about his age and forced him to abandon his bid for re-election.\n\nA year ago this week he cut a forlorn figure sitting beside his wife, Jill, in the US Capitol Rotunda in Washington as Trump delivered an inaugural address that spelled out his determination to erase the Biden legacy.\n\nWhereas Biden had cast 6 January 2021 as a dark day for US democracy, Trump used his first day to issue sweeping pardons to more than 1,500 rioters, installed 2020 election deniers in senior posts and used state machinery to reframe the assault as an episode of patriotic protest.\n\nWhile Biden signed the biggest climate spending bill in history, Trump has mounted an unrestrained assault on clean-energy initiatives and championed fossil fuels as the engine of cheaper energy and the burgeoning AI sector.\n\nTrump has rejected Biden’s faith in professionalism and expertise, dismissing thousands of career officials, imposing loyalty tests and hollowing out agencies previously insulated from political interference. He elevated Robert F Kennedy Jr and other fringe voices to influential positions in healthcare.\n\nThe president has purged diversity, equity and inclusion frameworks from government and mounted a broad offensive on universities and public bodies he blames for the Biden-era “woke” agenda. It comes alongside an aggressive hardening of immigration policy, both illegal and legal.\n\nAnd on the global stage, Trump is sketching a new world order based on power, strength and self-interest, straining relations with allies through threats of seizing land and imposing tariffs and economic coercion. It is a far cry from Biden’s commitment to postwar structures such as Nato and support for Ukraine.\n\nIn the face of such an onslaught it is Barack Obama, 64, who has been more politically active, taking part in dozens of public engagements including campaign rallies during last November’s elections.\n\nBiden’s forays into public life, by contrast, have been few and far between. In May his post-presidential office announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, which had spread to his bones.\n\nIn July he spoke at the Society for Human Resource Management’s convention in San Diego, California, and said he was receiving calls “from a number of European leaders asking me to get engaged”. Biden also revealed he was “working like hell” to write a 500-page memoir, which he reportedly sold for $10m to Little, Brown & Co, an imprint within Hachette.\n\nHowever, NBC News reported that Biden was struggling to raise money for a presidential library from donors who feel fatigued and let down. Obama’s presidential library is due to open in Chicago this spring.\n\nIn October, Biden addressed an audience in Boston after receiving a lifetime achievement award from the Edward M Kennedy Institute. “Friends, I can’t sugar-coat any of this. These are dark days,” Biden said. He then predicted the country would “find our true compass again” and “emerge as we always have – stronger, wiser and more resilient, more just, so long as we keep the faith”.\n\nBut Democrats have shown little appetite for such interventions. Many still blame Biden for stubbornly clinging on to the 2024 presidential nomination until it was too late, giving Harris only 107 days to forge a campaign of her own. His failure to prevent Trump’s return to the Oval Office is seen as an indelible stain on his legacy.\n\nFrank Luntz, a political consultant and pollster, said: “He left office on a low and even Democrats feel like they were misled, so it’s gonna take a while for his reputation to return. He had a good one for the first couple of years but that’s not what people remember of his presidency. They remember how he went out, not how he came in.”\n\nNow regarded as yesterday’s news, Biden is fading more quickly from the collective consciousness than most ex-presidents. But if anyone is keeping his memory alive, it is Trump and his fellow Republicans. The 79-year-old incumbent constantly references his predecessor in speeches and at press conferences, often with insults such as “Crooked Joe” and “Sleepy Joe”.\n\nTrump installed a “presidential walk of fame” along the White House’s west colonnade, featuring portraits of past presidents, replacing Biden’s portrait with an autopen image to mock his age and legitimacy. An accompanying plaque calls him “by far, the worst President in American History”.\n\nLuntz added: “It feels like the election isn’t over. It feels like it’s being rerun. It’s Groundhog Day. The election’s being run again and again and again.”\n\nThe White House has opened an investigation into the Biden administration’s use of the presidential autopen, which Trump has called “one of the biggest scandals in the history of our country”. Republicans in the House of Representatives launched investigations asserting that Biden’s closest advisers covered up a physical and mental decline during his presidency. The Senate started a series of hearings focused on his mental fitness.\n\nBut political commentators are sceptical that, more than a year into Trump’s presidency, efforts to make the electorate look back in anger at the 46th president will have much purchase.\n\nBill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said: “Based on survey evidence, Trump’s effort to blame Biden for the current state of the economy is falling flat with the American people. By a margin of better than two to one, they say it’s Trump’s economy, not Biden’s, so from that standpoint rattling on about Biden on the most important issue facing the country is manifestly not helping him.”","summary":"The 46th president largely exists as Trump’s foil, with his successor blaming him for the country’s woes\n\nIn bitter cold beneath the US Capitol dome, he walked to a marine helicopter and shared parting words with Donald Trump.

Makeup Artists Have Thoughts.","text":"If you’ve been on TikTok the past year, you’ve likely seen the “conservative girl” trend taking over your “For You” page. \n\nLiberal comedian Suzanne Lambert kicked off the trend with a video making fun of what she believed “MAGA girlies” looked like. According to her, Republican women have poorly lined lips, mismatched foundation and clumped mascara. The overall effect is “matte and flat,” as Lambert put it in her TikTok. “It’s giving drained, it’s giving dusty.” \n\nSince Lambert’s TikTok, hundreds of others under #republicanmakeup have done similar takes on the aggressively overdone and underblended “conservative girl” look.\n\nThe videos have slight differences, but the “applied-in-the-dark” poorly done look is the same. The eyebrows are like blocks on the face. The black eyeliner creates stark circles. The concealer is too pale, and the caked, dry foundation is noticeably too pale or too orange compared to the rest of the body.\n\nOffenders include White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, new Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, among other mostly white Republican women, according to TikTok. \n\nIs this trend just a chance for TikTokers to bully Republicans who are not blending the foundation in their jawline to their liking, or is “conservative girl” makeup actually real? \n\nThe makeup artists who powder and contour politicians and political women across the ideological spectrum would know. They all had strong opinions on this TikTok trend.\n\nSome makeup artists do believe there’s a “conservative girl” look. \n\nKriss Blevens, who has done makeup on politicians ranging from Tulsi Gabbard to Hillary Clinton, has been a makeup artist for politicians through nine election cycles. She said the Republican makeup look for women is evolving, and she is a fan of the “pageantry” more of them seem to be embracing. \n\nThe best versions of the conservative-girl looks are “slightly matte” and have “a bronzed quality,” Blevens said. “They’re making the eyes, the cheeks and the lips stand out.”\n\nAnd if any of these attempts at pageantry resemble the clownish looks being skewered on TikTok, then “that’s user error,” Blevens said. “The person doesn’t know how to blend, or somebody picked out the wrong color for them, or they’re using their summer color.”\n\nIn Blevens’ view, Noem is “nailing it,” and Leavitt is “trying” and “keeps looking better and better.”\n\nEven if you cannot clock a conservative woman from a mile away, you could probably correctly guess which TV network she will appear on.\n\nMichelle Phillips, a makeup artist who has worked at both the Republican National Convention and the Democratic National Convention, said the Republican look is a “reflection of branding rather than personal preference,” she said. \n\n“Female anchors on conservative TV networks are often styled with more bold-looking makeup. In contrast, networks that are more liberal tend to favor a more understated approach with softer makeup,” Phillips said. \n\n“Women on Fox News definitely don’t shy away from makeup, as opposed to the people that are on CNN and MSNBC,” said South Carolina-based freelance makeup artist Leah Greene, who has done makeup on political figures ranging from presidential candidates Marianne Williamson and Kamala Harris to “Fox & Friends” cohost Ainsley Earhardt. \n\n“I don’t think the conservatives know there’s a different look, but I think the liberals, they recognize it more,” Greene said. She said she has gotten requests from her more liberal clients not to make them look like a guest going on Fox.\n\n“I wouldn’t do a bronzer on a non-conservative, I would do more neutral colors, lipstick and blush,” she said as an example. \n\nOf course, conservative women are not the only people who underblend. Greene said male politicians, in general, can underblend the spray tans they get in their desire to look “healthy.”\n\n“The men are the ones that you can tell their spray tanner doesn’t go all the way up to their hairline, more than the women,” she said, noting that Donald Trump “at times” has had bad spray tans, but “he’s done a much better job this time than last time on his paint.”\n\nCakey foundation and poor blending are universal.\n\nThen again, clumped mascara doesn’t necessarily mean you are a MAGA enthusiast or a radical socialist. It might just mean you are bad at makeup. \n\nNatalie Hayes, a makeup artist who has worked on Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams (D), disagreed with the notion that the poorly done “conservative girl” look is limited to right-wing women, noting that politicians are “uniquely themselves.” Some are bad at makeup, no matter what their politics are. \n\nHayes cited a current Democratic congresswoman with “overplucked McDonald’s brows to the moon” and a conservative senior White House official with “worn-off lip liner in the corners of her mouth” as examples. “Women are who they are. ‘Underblended’ knows no race, ethnicity, or political camp.” \n\n“Some sit in my chair and say, ‘Do whatever you want, I know this is not an area I’m strong in,’ and others say, ‘Here is my makeup, use this here,’” Hayes said. \n\nAngella Theriault, a Boston-based makeup artist who has worked with women of all political ideologies for weddings, similarly said the “Republican makeup” look doesn’t actually exist.\n\n“If I had a client that was like, ‘Give me a Republican makeup look,’ I would look at her like she was crazy. We’re going to cater this to you and your features, and do the job.”\n\nHowever, if there is a consistent “conservative girl” look on TV screens or in real life, it is not in the makeup application — it is in the lack of racial diversity, Theriault said.\n\nThough she finds a TikTok trend that is making fun of people’s appearances to be mean, Theriault said how the trend targets white women is an accurate reflection of how homogenous the Republican Party is. \n\nAnd it’s true: A majority of white women ― particularly evangelical and non-college-educated white women― voted to bring Trump back to the White House in 2024. \n\n“The vast majority are white. If they’re not blonde, they’re dye-blonde,” Theriault said. “Of course they all look the same in makeup because they’re largely all using the same shades.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-bad-conservative-girl-makeup-exclusively-a-republican-problem-makeup-artists-have-thoughts-goog_l_6972482ce4b0dfed7798d4e1?origin=top-ad-recirc","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/67ae4236160000230063774e.jpeg?cache=OUWmQdaOLO&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 12:00:20","author":"Monica Torres","authors":["Monica Torres"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.111},{"id":395654732,"title":"Is Bad 'Conservative Girl' Makeup Exclusively A Republican Problem?

We’re going to cater this to you and your features, and do the job.”\n\nHowever, if there is a consistent “conservative girl” look on TV screens or in real life, it is not in the makeup application — it is in the lack of racial diversity, Theriault said.\n\nThough she finds a TikTok trend that is making fun of people’s appearances to be mean, Theriault said how the trend targets white women is an accurate reflection of how homogenous the Republican Party is. \n\nAnd it’s true: A majority of white women ― particularly evangelical and non-college-educated white women― voted to bring Trump back to the White House in 2024. \n\n“The vast majority are white. If they’re not blonde, they’re dye-blonde,” Theriault said. “Of course they all look the same in makeup because they’re largely all using the same shades.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-bad-conservative-girl-makeup-exclusively-a-republican-problem-makeup-artists-have-thoughts-goog_l_6972482ce4b0dfed7798d4e1?origin=home-life-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/67ae4236160000230063774e.jpeg?cache=OUWmQdaOLO&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 12:00:20","author":"Monica Torres","authors":["Monica Torres"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.111},{"id":395649782,"title":"One year in, Hispanic voters in Central Florida are conflicted on Trump","text":"President Donald Trump entered office last January thanks in part to a wave of Hispanic voters, enough in one solidly-Democratic Central Florida County to turn it GOP red. But the tide may be changing.\n\nA year into his presidency, the driving factor for many Hispanics — Trump’s campaign promise to improve the economy — is not fulfilled. Immigration raids across the country have also sparked fear in many Hispanic communities, even among those who are U.S. citizens.\n\n“Mess around and find out,” said Ediberto Roman, a law professor at Florida International University who predicted before the 2024 election that Trump’s mass deportation plans would result in “a reign of terror” for anyone “existing while brown.”\n\n“People think, ‘We’re not them, this is about the other [Hispanics],'” Roman said. “But it’s time for the Latino and Latina communities to wake up. It’s about all of us.”\n\nAbout 70% of Latinos disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job as president, while 65% disapprove of the administration’s approach to immigration and 61% say Trump’s policies have made economic conditions worse, according to recent polling from the Pew Research Center.\n\nTrump’s approval among his own Latino voters remains positive, but it has declined since he took office. Any erosion of support could play a major role in November’s midterm elections.\n\nErin Huntley, GOP chair of Orange County, said she believes Trump’s support will hold, as Republicans focus on the values that Hispanic communities align with most: faith and affordability.\n\n“Republicans are talking about ways to cut government spending and cut taxes,” Huntley said. “Right now all the proposals coming from the Democrats side are, ‘We want to tax you more.'”\n\nIn 2024, Osceola County — where less than 28% of voters are registered Republicans and the majority of the population identifies as Hispanic — narrowly voted for Trump, flipping from 2020’s double-digit victory for Democrat Joe Biden there.\n\nWhile Republicans hail the shift in Hispanic voters as a lasting realignment, Samuel Vilchez Santiago, a Venezuelan American and the Orange County Democratic chair, argued that’s not the case.\n\nAs he runs for the state House, Vilchez Santiago says Hispanics have told him they voted for Trump because they wanted change in the country. But now they’re worried his priorities are not what they expected.\n\n“They are creating an environment of fear across communities that honestly feels very racially-targeted,” Vilchez Santiago said. “There’s a lot of mixed-status families here in Florida …and a lot of people, including those that voted for Trump, are seeing their families or those close to them directly impacted by the mass deportations.”\n\nPuerto Ricans, Cubans and Venezuelans are three key Hispanic demographics who have had very different experiences amid Trump’s immigration crackdown, as the three groups’ immigration status varies widely.\n\nPuerto Ricans have enjoyed U.S. citizenship since 1917, while Cubans — once embraced for fleeing communism — became the largest GOP supporters among Hispanics. But Venezuelans are one of the newest major demographics, with many having fled Nicolas Maduro’s regime in recent years.\n\nFor Puerto Ricans, immigration is “not really a concern,” said Fernando Rivera, the director of the Puerto Rico Research Hub at the University of Central Florida. Most who voted for Trump did so for his stated economic agenda, he said.\n\n“I think it shows how good the Republican messaging is,” Rivera said. “But if things don’t improve soon that support is going to go away.”\n\nAnnette Perez, a Kissimmee finance worker originally from Puerto Rico, voted for Trump in 2024 because of his friendly rhetoric towards business owners. While she says the economy is not doing well, she’s optimistic about the ultimate impact of Trump’s tariffs.\n\n“Prices in the grocery store being so high is worrisome … but I’m confident it will eventually get better,” Perez said in Spanish. “We are going to see things get worse before they get better.”\n\nRamon Diaz, a Puerto Rican pastor in Kissimmee, voted for Trump in 2024 because he “is not a politician but a businessman.”\n\n“He’s managing the presidency like a business and trying to get the economy out of the hole it is in,” Diaz said in Spanish.\n\nChurch members “tell me, ‘Pastor the prices keep going up, but my wages do not,'” Diaz said. “I see that people are not going out to eat as much because they have to save money, and this will continue to happen. But it will pass.”\n\nBoth said only undocumented immigrants who have criminal records should be deported — a policy not followed by the administration. Those without criminal records have become the majority among those detained, according to The Guardian.\n\n“A lot of people focus on the bad things, like immigration, but they don’t understand the good he’s doing with the economy,” Perez said. “I’m a citizen, so immigration doesn’t impact me.”\n\nMary Vega, also from Puerto Rico and who works at a credit repair company in Kissimmee, agreed.\n\n“I don’t feel at risk,” said Vega.\n\nVenezuelans, meanwhile, long saw appeal in Republican ideology as refugees from a socialist regime but have since become targets of the Trump administration, which revoked temporary protection status for thousands in Florida.\n\nAt the same time, the midnight capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month sparked mixed emotions in the community.\n\nAt a gathering in Orlando one day after Maduro’s capture, Diego Oliva, a Venezuelan American Valencia College student, applauded Trump’s action but stopped short of saying he would vote Republican.\n\n“I thank God that he allowed the end of the regime and he manifested it by using President Trump like an instrument for his glory,” Oliva said in Spanish. “I’m very thankful to Trump.”\n\nBut Maria Puerta-Riera, a Valencia College politics professor from Venezuela, says the Venezuelan community is not likely to vote for the GOP amid the immigration crackdown just because of Maduro’s removal.\n\n“Many of them are going to vote [Democratic], not because they like the Democratic Party but because they see it as a way to punish the Republican Party,” Puerta-Riera said.\n\nPuerta-Riera said despite their small voting power, Venezuelans may be able to influence a shift among other Hispanic voters.\n\n“We are like a proxy vote for the rest of the Hispanic community,” Puerta-Riera said. “We are putting pressure on some voters, especially Cuban American voters.”\n\nCubans, once the immigrant backbone of the GOP in Florida, previously enjoyed more protections from deportations than any other Hispanic group. But under Trump, just over 1,600 Cubans were deported in 2025, the New York Times reported, more than during the three previous administrations.\n\nMiami’s historic vote for Eileen Higgins, its first Democratic mayor in 30 years, highlights what could be a major political shift. She beat Trump-backed Emilio Gonzalez in the Hispanic-majority city.[\n\nGilbert Lima, 49, a Cuban-American from Miami visiting a friend in Kissimmee, said he voted for both Kamala Harris in 2024 and for Higgins. Still, he said he understands why many Latinos voted for Trump, adding the instability in the economy right now doesn’t scare them.\n\n“For better or worse, Latinos are used to hiccups in the economy or things going awry,” Lima said. “You just figure things out, as opposed to people that are more Americanized who tend to freak out more.”\n\nBut Lima said Cubans who voted for Trump should not be “surprised” by how he’s handled immigrants, stripping many of their status.\n\n“He was going to [find] a loophole, ‘Well, you came here legally [but] you’re now a criminal,'” Lima said. “Anyone who can put two and two together saw that coming from a mile away.”","url":"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2026/01/24/one-year-in-hispanic-voters-in-central-florida-are-conflicted-on-trump/","image":"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/TOS-L-VenezuelaRestaurant372.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 12:00:07","author":"Natalia Jaramillo","authors":["Natalia Jaramillo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":395658618,"title":"Pro-life movement grapples with how to maintain leverage over GOP leaders","text":"Pro-life influence in Republican politics was evident for decades. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani sat atop national polls for most of the year before the 2008 Republican presidential primaries. He was “America’s Mayor” and seen as a hero during the 9/11 terrorist attacks. His endorsement and campaign appearances were coveted by Republicans even in blue states.\n\nYet, once 2008 rolled around, Giuliani didn’t win a single primary. The main reason was abortion. Giuliani was pro-choice. He had switched to that position before his first, unsuccessful run for mayor of New York in 1989. It was seen as a necessity in such a heavily Democratic area. Giuliani did not think he could successfully flip-flop again, though he did pledge to support some abortion restrictions and nominate anti-Roe judges.\n\nFor pro-life leaders, this wasn’t good enough. They and other social conservatives banded together to oppose his nomination. This contributed to Giuliani’s disastrous decision to avoid the early states in the 2008 GOP primaries. He thought Iowa and South Carolina were too socially conservative and pro-life for him to win. Giuliani didn’t want to face Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, or John McCain in the more pro-choice state of New Hampshire.\n\nGiuliani tried to make his stand in Florida. But by the time that primary took place, the race had passed him by. Republicans did not end up nominating a supporter of legal abortion for president that year.\n\nFuture Republican presidential candidates with pro-choice pasts made different tactical decisions. Romney, who had campaigned as a backer of abortion rights in liberal Massachusetts, changed his position ahead of his first GOP presidential bid. He was rewarded with the party’s presidential nomination on his second try in 2012.\n\nThen came the thrice-married, twice-divorced reality TV star Donald Trump, Giuliani’s fellow New Yorker. He declared himself “totally pro-choice” when he first flirted with a national run in 1999, though he admitted he despised “the concept of abortion.” But when Trump sought the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, he changed his position. He opposed abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother’s life is in danger, like every GOP nominee since Ronald Reagan.\n\nWhen Trump won the nomination, he picked a solid pro-lifer as his running mate in Mike Pence. The Republican platform kept its strong language against abortion, the product of years of work by pro-life activists. He made a list of conservative potential Supreme Court nominees and pledged to fill the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s seat, kept open by Senate Republicans who blocked then-President Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland, with a like-minded jurist.\n\nTrump kept his promises. He issued the same executive orders on abortion as the last three Republican presidents. He appointed conservative judges. And when the time came, every single Trump nominee to the Supreme Court voted to overturn Roe. He has expressed pride in his contribution to that pro-life victory.\n\nBut Trump was also mindful of the liberal backlash against Dobbs. He blamed abortion for the Republicans’ underperformance in the 2022 midterm elections, which took place months after Roe fell. He urged Republicans to be politically smart about the issue.\n\n“I have to tell you from a conservative and Republican standpoint, you have to learn how to talk about pro-life, you have to learn how to talk about that decision,” Trump said in 2023. “Because you don’t know how to talk about it.”\n\nDemocrats, Trump said in South Carolina that year, “have energized this issue and the Republicans are going to have to learn how to fight it.”\n\nTrump once again won the Republican presidential nomination and chose a committed abortion foe, then-Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance, as his running mate. But Vance had seen up close setbacks for the pro-life cause at the ballot box in his home state of Ohio. Trump weakened the abortion plank in the 2024 Republican platform. Democrats planned to make it a major issue in the fall campaign.\n\nThe triangulation strategy largely worked. According to exit polls, Trump won 92% of voters who thought abortion should be illegal in most cases and 88% who believed it should be illegal in all cases. But he and former Vice President Kamala Harris split voters who thought abortion should be legal in most cases at 49% apiece.\n\nTrump carried 91% of voters who said abortion should be illegal. He still managed 29% of those who thought it should be legal. He barely lost to Harris on the question of who voters trusted more to handle abortion, 49% to 46%. Trump won the popular vote by 49.8% to 48.3%.\n\nSince returning to office, Trump has frustrated pro-life activists by not restricting access to abortion pills by mail, undercutting state-level abortion restrictions made possible by Dobbs. He also appointed a pro-choice secretary of health and human services and waffled on Hyde Amendment restrictions on abortion funding as part of an Obamacare subsidies fix.\n\nVance counseled prudence at the March for Life on Friday as activists contemplated how to maximize their influence.\n\nThere is only one anti-abortion Democrat left in Congress. The movement can’t afford to lose its place at the table in the Republican Party.","summary":"Nearly four years after the pro-life movement achieved its biggest victory with the reversal of Roe v.

If we don't fight, fascism wins.\"The local man held a sign reading \"five-years-old, dude,\" a reference to Ramos.Thousands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have been deployed to the Democratic-led city, as President Donald Trump presses his campaign to deport undocumented immigrants across the country.On a visit to Minneapolis on Thursday, Vice President JD Vance confirmed Ramos was among those detained. But he argued that agents were protecting him after his father \"ran\" from officers.\"What are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a five-year-old child freeze to death?\" he said.UN human rights chief Volker Turk called on US authorities to end the \"harmful treatment of migrants and refugees.\"Arias, the father of the boy, was at a Texas detention facility, according to an ICE database that does not list the whereabouts of under-18s.'Dealing with children'Border Patrol senior official Gregory Bovino defended his officers' treatment of Ramos, telling reporters Friday: \"I will say unequivocally that we are experts in dealing with children.\"ICE commander Marcos Charles said Friday \"my officers did everything they could to reunite him with his family\" and alleged that Ramos's family refused to open the door to him after his father left him and ran from officers.They would be detained \"pending their immigration proceedings,\" he added after alleging they entered the United States illegally and were \"deportable.\"Ramos's teacher, whose name was given as Ella, called him \"a bright young student.\"In Minneapolis, where temperatures touched -23C (-9F) on Friday, protesters wrapped in hats, gloves and scarves chanted \"ICE out\" as part of a broader anti-ICE day of action.Separately, protesters picketed outside Minneapolis-St. Paul airport over the facility's use for deporting those swept up in immigration raids.Methodist pastor Mariah Furness Tollgaard said in a statement that 100 members of clergy were arrested and charged with trespassing and disobeying a peace officer on Friday, while demonstrating at the airport.\"As a faith leader in Minnesota, my tradition teaches that every person bears the image of God and is worthy of dignity and safety, and in this moment, all people of faith and moral conscience must stand up,\" she said.'Just a baby'Former US vice president Kamala Harris said she was \"outraged\" by Ramos's detention and called him \"just a baby.\"Ramos is one of at least four children detained in the same Minneapolis school district this month, administrators said.Minneapolis has been rocked by increasingly tense protests since federal agents shot and killed US citizen Renee Good on January 7.An autopsy concluded that the killing was a homicide, a classification that does not automatically mean a crime was committed.The officer who fired the shots that killed Good, Jonathan Ross, has neither been suspended nor charged.Marc Prokosch, the lawyer for Ramos and his father, said they followed the law in applying for asylum in Minneapolis, a sanctuary city where police do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities.Children have been caught up in immigration enforcement under both Republican and Democratic administrations.Minnesota has sought a temporary restraining order for the ICE operation in the state which, if granted by a federal judge, would pause the sweeps.

But House Speaker Mike Johnson shouldn't expect many reinforcements anytime soon. This month's shocking early House retirement of MAGA firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and the unexpected death of Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa of California further shrunk the GOP's margins in the chamber. And that has House GOP leaders keeping a tight leash on the party's rank and file members. DEMOCRATIC TAKEOVER FEARS SOAR AS HOUSE REPUBLICANS CLING TO FRAGILE MAJORITY \"They'd better be here,\" Johnson recently said of his members. \"I told everybody, and not in jest, I said, no adventure sports, no risk-taking, take your vitamins.

REP. LAMALFA'S DEATH FURTHER SHRINKS REPUBLICAN HOUSE MAJORITY There are currently four vacant House districts, which means four special elections to fill the seats. But it's the Democrats rather than the Republicans who will likely benefit more from the ballot box results in the short run. Here's a look at the special elections that are on deck: Jan. 31 Voters in Texas' Democrat-dominated 18th Congressional District, which is anchored by downtown Houston and surrounding areas, head to the polls on the last day of January to choose a successor to fill the seat left vacant when Rep. Sylvester Turner died last March. Democrats Christian Menefee, a former attorney for Houston's Harris County, and former Houston City Council member Amanda Edwards are facing off in the special election. They were the top two finishers in a field of 16 candidates that faced off in an initial election in November. While Texas has redrawn its congressional maps for the 2026 midterms, as part of the high-stakes redistricting battle between President Donald Trump and Republicans versus Democrats, the special election will use the state's current district lines. FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER MCCARTHY WARNS MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE IS ‘THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE’ The winner of the special election will give the Democrats one additional House member, giving Republican leadership further headaches. Feb. 5 Eleven candidates are running in the Democratic Party primary in New Jersey's 11th Congressional District. The seat was left vacant after now New Jersey Gov. Mikie Sherrill stepped down after winning November's gubernatorial election in the Garden State. The winner of the Democratic primary will face off with Randolph Mayor Joe Hathaway, the only Republican to file for the special election, which will be held on April 16. The suburban district in northern New Jersey leans to the left, with Sherrill winning re-election in 2024 by 15 points, the same margin she carried the district in November's gubernatorial showdown. REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: HOUSE EXODUS THREATENS JOHNSON'S GRIP ON POWER AS OVER 40 MEMBERS HEAD FOR EXIT But then-Vice President Kamala Harris won the district by just eight points in the 2024 presidential election, giving the GOP some hopes of possibly flipping the seat. March 10 A whopping 22 candidates, including 17 Republicans, are running in a special election in the 14th Congressional District, in the race to succeed Greene. According to Georgia state law, all the candidates will run on the same ballot. If no contender tops 50% of the vote, a runoff election between the top two finishers will take place on April 7. The district in northwestern Georgia is solidly Republican, with Greene winning re-election in 2024 by nearly 30 points and Trump carrying the district by 37 points. June 2 Primary Day in California for the 2026 elections will also include a primary for the special election in the state's 1st Congressional District, in the race to fill LaMalfa's seat. The general election will be held on Aug. 4. The district, in northeastern California, is solidly Republican. Similar to Texas, California is also altering its congressional maps as part of the redistricting wars, but the special election will be held under the current district lines. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP The White House and congressional Republicans criticized the decision by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom to not hold a special election to fill LaMalfa's seat until August, six months after the late congressman's death. But Democrats similarly complained about Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas not scheduling the special election to fill Turner's seat until eight months after the late lawmaker died.

Not so racist Trump America that was heavily responsible for Apartheid Israel’s Gaza Genocide by provision of weapons, bombs, funding and UNSC vetoes. Instead the US and its criminal appointees will illegally rule Gaza in defiance of international law and permit continuance of the humanitarian catastrophe and Gaza Genocide. \n\nExpert assessment of the urgent aid need has been provided by expert epidemiologists published in the leading medical journal The Lancet. Epidemiologists estimated that 64,260 Gazans had died violently by 30 June 2024 (Day 269 of the killing) [1] and hence that 175,000 Gazans had died violently by 7 October 2025 (Day 731) i.e. after 2 years of killing. The wartime ratio of indirect deaths from imposed deprivation to direct, violent deaths ranges from 3 (the Iraq War, 1990-2011) to 16 (the Afghan War, 2001-2021) (see Gideon Polya, “Post-9/11 US-imposed Muslim Holocaust & Muslim Genocide” [2]). Epidemiologists “conservatively” estimated 4 deaths from imposed deprivation in Gaza for every violent death [3-5], this indicating 700,000 non-violent deaths and 875,000 Gazans in total killed by violence and imposed deprivation by 7 October 2025 (i.e. in 2 years). Assuming (in the absence of other data) that the relative proportions of child, women and men deaths are the same for indirect (non-violent) deaths and for violent deaths reported by the Gaza health authorities, then the 875,000 Gazan deaths by 7 October 2025 are conservatively estimated to include the deaths of 325,000 children, 207,000 women and 342,000 men. However this underestimates child deaths because it ignores the high vulnerability of under-5 year old infants who represent about 70% of avoidable deaths from deprivation in impoverished countries (see Gideon Polya, “Body Count. Global avoidable mortality since 1950” [6])\n\n.The “ceasefire” of mid-October 2025 substantially reduced the violent killing of Gazans by the genocidal Zionist Israelis that nevertheless remorselessly continues. US-backed genocidal Apartheid Israel still applies massive constraints on aid delivery and catastrophically excludes 37 food and medical aid groups from Gaza, this meaning that Gazans are continuing to die from Zionist Israeli-imposed deprivation. Over 27 horrific months the people of Gaza (47% children before the present Gaza Massacre) have suffered bombing, shooting, burying under rubble, near-total devastation of homes and infrastructure, and substantial deprivation from water, food, shelter, sanitation, clothing, fuel, electricity, medicine, and medical care. The Zionist Israeli-imposed Gaza Genocide has involved the mass murder of 875,000 Gazans (36.5% of the pre-war population) by violence and continuing man-made famine, starvation and huge avoidable deaths from imposed deprivation to the utter shame of a World unable to stop genocidal US state terrorism and Israeli state terrorism. \n\nThe Office of the UN Human Rights Commissioner has summarized the 19 July 2024 determinations of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the self-government of the Occupied Palestinian Territory: “Israel and other UN Member States must immediately comply with the authoritative determination by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Israel’s presence in the occupied Palestinian territory, independent human rights experts said today. The landmark ruling of 19 July 2024 declared that Israel’s occupation of the Gaza strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is unlawful, along with the associated settlement regime, annexation and use of natural resources. The Court added that Israel’s legislation and measures violate the international prohibition on racial segregation and apartheid. The ICJ mandated Israel to end its occupation, dismantle its settlements, provide full reparations to Palestinian victims and facilitate the return of displaced people” [7-10] .\n\nThe World must accordingly (a) order Apartheid Israel to immediately cease the genocide and provide requisite life-sustaining food and medical services to Gaza (as demanded of any Occupier for its Occupied Subjects “to the fullest extent of the means available to it” by Articles 55 and 56 of the Fourth Geneva Convention [11]), (b) to demand that Apartheid Israel cease the illegal Occupation as rapidly as possible, and (c) immediately impose rigorous Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) against Apartheid Israel and all its racist supporters, notably the US and neo-Nazi Germany, until requisite aid, reparations and war crimes trials are delivered. \n\nHowever the US and Apartheid Israel reject the ICJ determination and International Law and have illegally imposed the 20-point Trump Peace Plan on the circa 1.5 million survivors of the US- and Israeli-imposed Gaza Massacre and Gaza Holocaust. Indeed in proposing Gaza as an opportunity for private real estate development as a new, luxury, Miami-style “Riviera”, Trump referred to “1.7 million” Gazans to be relocated, this implying that only 2.4 million -1.7 million = 0.7 million Gazans were left, noting that perhaps 100,000 have temporarily escaped to Egypt [11-14]. Donald Trump in the Oval Office when asked if Palestinians could return to Gaza (February 2025) : “It would be my hope that we could do something really nice, really good where they wouldn’t want to return…If we can build something for them in one of the countries, and it could be Jordan and it could be Egypt, it could be other countries and you could build four or five or six areas.. we could do something where they wouldn’t want to go back” and when asked about how many people: “Everyone. We are talking about probably a million seven (1.7 million) people. Million seven, maybe a million eight. But I think all of them, I think they’ll be resettled in areas where they can live a beautiful life and not be worried about dying every day” [13, 14].\n\nThe genocidal war criminals Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump are responsible for a Gaza Holocaust in which 680,000 Gazans, mostly children, died from violence and deprivation by 25 April 2025 and 875,000 died thus by 7 October 2025 i.e. after 2 years of the killing in genocidal reprisals for 1,200 Israelis killed in the Palestinian Breakout from the Gaza Concentration Camp on 7 October 2023 (most likely killed by the responding IDF). In an Orwellian twist these child-killing mass murderers involved in the Gaza Genocide have advanced a Gaza Peace Plan that denies Gazans freedom, human rights and self-determination for an indefinite period. Both war criminal and genocidally racist proponents reject International Law and have explicitly proposed mass ethnic cleaning of Palestinians [16]. International Law-violating and fascist Trump America and neo-Nazi Germany provided the arms for the Gaza Genocide [17]. Indeed there is a shocking list of 52 Zionist- and Apartheid Israeli-Nazi Germany comparisons [17-19]. Despite the “ceasefire” the Zionist Israelis continue to kill, maim and starve Gazans, with the Ministry of Health in Gaza reporting 240 deaths and over 1,180 injuries by 5 January 2026) due to Israeli violations of the ceasefire agreement [20], this indicative of about 1,000 Gazan “deaths from violence and deprivation” (Google this phrase) since the 10 October 2025 Ceasefire. Israeli Defence Minister Katz has repeatedly stated that Israel will never leave Gaza [21]. For all that the West clings to the fig leaf of a “2 state solution”, genocidally racist Apartheid Israel totally opposes this.\n\nIn stark contrast to the evil machinations of Trump America, Apartheid Israel and the US Alliance, the ICJ has ordered immediate peace and an immediate end to the illegal Zionist Israeli Occupation with the immediate consequence of rapid assessment io the dead, injured and dangerously deprived with immediate requisite aid delivery to Gaza (plus reparations and war crimes trials for harm done) [15]. The immediate solution to all of this evil is simply “all human rights for all” including for the sorely oppressed Occupied Palestinian after a century of a Western-backed Palestinian Genocide (3.1 million Palestinians killed by violence and deprivation). \n\nWho are the key people involved in the racist, illegal and likely genocidal Trump Peace Plan?\n\nThe White House has set out the people involved in the illegal Trump Peace Plan: “Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump congratulated the formation of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), a vital step forward in implementing Phase Two of his Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict—a 20-point roadmap for lasting peace, stability, reconstruction, and prosperity in the region. The NCAG will be led by Dr. Ali Sha’ath, a widely respected technocratic leader who will oversee the restoration of core public services, the rebuilding of civil institutions, and the stabilization of daily life in Gaza, while laying the foundation for long-term, self-sustaining governance…\n\nTo operationalize the Board of Peace’s vision—under the chairmanship of President Donald J. Trump—a founding Executive Board has been formed, composed of leaders with experience across diplomacy, development, infrastructure, and economic strategy. The appointed members are: Secretary Marco Rubio, Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, Sir Tony Blair, Marc Rowan, Ajay Banga, Robert Gabriel…\n\nthe Chairman has appointed Aryeh Lightstone and Josh Gruenbaum as senior advisors to the Board of Peace, charged with leading day-to-day strategy and operations, and translating the Board’s mandate and diplomatic priorities into disciplined execution. H.E. Nickolay Mladenov, an Executive Board member, will serve as the High Representative for Gaza. In this capacity, he will act as the on-the-ground link between the Board of Peace and the NCAG…\n\nTo establish security, preserve peace, and establish a durable terror-free environment, Major General Jasper Jeffers has been appointed Commander of the International Stabilization Force (ISF)…\n\nIn support of the Office of the High Representative and the NCAG, a Gaza Executive Board is being established. The Board will help support effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza. The appointed members are: Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, Minister Hakan Fidan, Ali Al-Thawadi, General Hassan Rashad, Sir Tony Blair, Marc Rowan, Minister Reem Al-Hashimy, Nickolay Mladenov, Yakir Gabay, Sigrid Kaag. The United States remains fully committed to supporting this transitional framework, working in close partnership with Israel, key Arab nations, and the international community to achieve the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan. The President calls on all parties to cooperate fully with the NCAG, the Board of Peace, and the International Stabilization Force to ensure the swift and successful implementation of the Comprehensive Plan. Additional Executive Board and Gaza Executive Board members will be announced over the coming weeks” [22].\n\nThe Trump plan violates International Law and the determination by the International Court of Justice that continued foreign occupation is illegal. Except for the NCAG to be led by eminent Palestinian engineer Dr. Ali Sha’ath, convicted felon Trump and his appointees will ignore Indigenous Palestinians and preside over total theft of Palestinian Land for real estate development by racist crook Trump and his wealthy American associates.\n\nSet out below are the backgrounds of those involved in the illegal Trump Peace Plan for US- and Apartheid Israel-devastated Gaza. \n\n (A).

Hakan Fidan: (a) Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs, (b) Hakan Firdan: “[Israel] committing genocide in Gaza for the past two years, ignoring basic humanitarian values right before the world’s eyes… The initiatives we have led and actively participated in have played an important role in many countries’ decisions to recognize Palestine. Indeed, countries including the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Malta, New Zealand, Portugal, and Australia announced their intention to recognize the State of Palestine in September. This marks a historic turning point in international diplomacy on the Palestinian issue. The fact that these countries have now begun to voice loudly their demand for an end to the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is a long overdue but highly valuable step… [atrocities committed in Gaza] have been recorded as one of the darkest chapters in human history… [Palestinian struggle] will alter the course of history, become a symbol for the oppressed, and shake the foundations of a decaying order… Israel’s reckless attacks on Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, and Iran are the clearest sign of a terrorist state mentality defying international order” [50], and (c) the Zionist Israeli far right psychopaths object to Muslim critics of Israel being on the Board of Peace and demand occupation, annexation and Jewish settlement of Gaza [51].\n\n(4).

General Hassan Rashad: (a) Egyptian intelligence chief critically helping to violently ensure the continuation of the Abdel Fattah el-Sisi military dictatorship. Sisi led the 2013 military overthrow of the democratically-elected Mohamed Morsi Muslim Brotherhood government, the first democratically-elected government in the 6,000 year history of Egypt. 3,000 civilians were killed and 19,000 arrested and highly abusively imprisoned. Ruthless dictator Sisi was subsequently elected in successive fake elections (as in Apartheid Israel) in which opposition candidates were excluded. Under Sisi Egypt is a draconian US- and Apartheid Israel-backed dictatorship [53], (b) an estimated 100,000 Gazans reportedly escaped the Gaza Genocide in Egypt but are likely to be returned, (c ) Egypt, like other Arab countries, refuses to be part of an Apartheid Israeli ethnic cleansing of the surviving 1.5 million Gazans, and (d) Egypt is a major recipient of US military aid despite Congressional prohibition of aid to dictatorships arising from overthrow of a democratically-elected government [54] – in 2022 Ukraine received the most US foreign aid in 2022: ($12.4 billion), followed by Apartheid Israel ($3.3 billion), Ethiopia ($2.2 billion), Afghanistan ($1.4 billion), Yemen ($1.4 billion) and Egypt ($1.4 billion) [34], and between 1946 and 2024, over $1 trillion, or roughly 30% of all US foreign aid, has gone to five countries: Israel ($337.0 billion), Egypt ($198.9 billion), former South Vietnam ($193.8 billion), Afghanistan ($168.5 billion), and South Korea ($127.6 billion), after adjusting for inflation [55].\n\n (6).

Marc Rowan: Jewish American billionaire worth about $8.8 billion, co-founder and CEO of Apollo Global Management, fervent supporter of genocidally racist Apartheid Israel and hence of the vile crime of Apartheid, and eligible for citizenship of Apartheid Israel ( see A6; [37].\n\n(8). Dr Reem Al-Hashim: (a) UAE politician, and current Minister of State for International Cooperation in the United Arab Emirates’ Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, (b) favours links with Apartheid Israel , (c ) she is part of a dictatorial regime that has made huge arms purchases from Apartheid Israel, and involved with Saudi Arabia and arms-supplying Apartheid Israel fighting starving Yemen and supporting the barbaric, genocidal and raping Rapid Support Force (RSF) in Sudan [56-58]\n\n(9). Nickolay Mladenov: (a) Bulgarian politician and diplomat appointed by Trump as High Representative for Gaza and tasked with leading the Board of Peace, (b) former Bulgarian Minister of Defense and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Member of the European Parliament , (c) had various UN Middle East diplomatic roles with close dealings with Netanyahu and the Israelis , and (d) was exposed by the Pandora Letters for international financial dealings [59].\n\n(10). Yakir Gabay: (a) Cypriot-Israeli billionaire real estate businessman based in Cyprus and a fervent Jewish Zionist, (b) owns 10% of Aroundtown SA, and (c) closely involved with highly-placed US Jewish Zionists in public narrative-changing backing of Apartheid Israel in the Gaza Genocide [60].\n\n(11). Sigrid Kaag: (a) Dutch politician and diplomat who was the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process since 2025 and the Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza since 2024, (b) former Dutch Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and (c) extensive involvement as a UN diplomat in the Middle East [61].\n\n(D ). The leaders of numerous countries have been invited to join the Board of Peace ($1 billion membership fee) but so far only the leaders of 23 countries have accepted, including ICC-sought war criminal and mass murderer of 875,000 Gazans , Apartheid Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu. France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK have declined to join [62, 63].\n\nFinal comments and conclusions.\n\nThe sorely oppressed circa 1.5 million surviving residents of the Gaza Concentration Camp are overwhelmingly Muslim, Arab, and Indigenous Palestinians. Most of the utterly impoverished and traumatized Gazans are women and children and essentially none are Jews, Zionists, pro-Zionists, Israelis, Americans, or Europeans. In stark contrast the 18 key people in A to C above and identified by the White House as involved in implementing the illegal Trump Peace Plan for Gaza [22] (i.e. ignoring the national leaders who have subsequently accepted the invitation to join an expanded and war criminal Board of Peace that is set to undermine humanitarian UN activities around the World. ):\n\n(1). only 1 is from Gaza (Dr. Ali Sha’ath).\n\n(2). only 1 is a Palestinian (Dr. Ali Sha’ath).\n\n(3). only 2 are women (Dr Reem Al-Hashim and Sigrid Kaag).\n\n(4). 1 is Zionist Israeli (Yakir Gabay).\n\n(5). only 5 are Muslims (Palestinian Dr. Ali Sha’ath, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi, Egyptian intelligence chief General Hassan Rashad, and UAE Minister Reem Al-Hashimy).\n\n(6). 10 are Americans (Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, Marc Rowan, Robert Gabriel, Ajay Banga, Aryeh Lightstone, Josh Gruenbaum, Major General Jasper Jeffers).\n\n(7). 15 are from the US or European countries (the 10 Americans plus Sir Tony Blair (UK), Nickolay Mladenov (Bulgaria), Sigrid Kaag (Netherlands), Yakir Gabay (Cyprus, Israel), Hakan Fidan (Turkiye)).\n\n(8). 5 are Jewish Zionists (Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, Marc Rowan, Aryeh Lightstone, Josh Gruenbaum).\n\n(9). 7 are non-Jewish pro-Zionists ( Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, Robert Gabriel, Ajay Banga, Jasper Jeffers, Sir Tony Blair, Nickolay Mladenov).\n\n(10), 6 are obscenely wealthy (Donald Trump, Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, Marc Rowan, Ajay Banga, Yakir Gabay ). \n\n(11). Unlike the1.5 million barely surviving, traumatized and variously injured Gazans substantially deprived of water, food, shelter, sanitation, clothing, electricity, fuel, economy, medicine and medical care , all 18 are well-fed, well-housed, healthy, happy, non-traumatized, un-injured, non-bereaved, protected by all the human rights set out in the 30 Articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [64], and have access to the very best of Western medicine. It must be noted that the Occupied Palestinians have been excluded from all the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. While Israeli Palestinians can vote for the government ruling them (albeit for Zionist-approved candidates) they but are subject to 65 race-based, Nazi-style, discriminatory laws [65, 66]. In stark contrast, Occupied Palestinians are excluded from all 30 Articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and cannot vote for the government ruling them (i.e. they are subject to egregious Apartheid) [67-70 ].\n\n(12). 6 people, have an altruistic agenda namely Dr. Ali Sha’ath, Dr Reem Al-Hashim, Sigrid Kaag, Hakan Fidan, Ali Al-Thawadi and even, Egyptian intelligence chief General Hassan Rashad. The remaining 12 Zionists and pro-Zionists are compromised as part of Trump’s illegal seizure of part of Palestine in war criminal violation of the determinations of the International Court of Justice (ICJ).\n\nThe genocidal Zionist American and Zionist Israeli Occupation of Gaza is illegal as determined by the International Court of Justice that mandated Israel to end its occupation, dismantle its settlements, provide full reparations to Palestinian victims and facilitate the return of displaced people [7-9]. However serial war criminal Trump and his thieving associates evidently plan on doing the opposite for private profit including seizure of all of the land of Gaza and Gaza’s share of the Eastern Mediterranean gas and oil [71].\n\nThe core ethos of Humanity is Kindness and Truth. Indeed the core messages from the WW2 Jewish Holocaust (and indeed from all holocausts and genocides) are “zero tolerance for lying”, “zero tolerance for racism”, “bear witness” and “never again to anyone”. However these key moral imperatives are grossly violated by genocidally racist, egregiously mendacious, and endlessly thieving Zionazi Apartheid Israel and its morally degenerate global supporters who are now complicit in the ongoing mass murder of children, mothers, women and men in the ongoing Gaza Massacre, Gaza Genocide and Gaza Holocaust. \n\nAs determined from data and methodology published by exert epidemiologists in the leading medical journal The Lancet, the first 2 years of the horrific, intentional and Zionist Israeli-imposed Gaza Genocide involved 875,000 Gaza “deaths from violence and deprivation” (Google this phrase), this including the deaths of 325,000 children, 207,000 women and 342,000 men [73- 79].\n\nZionism is genocidal racism in explicit genocidal advocacy and in appalling genocidal practice by Apartheid Israel. War is the penultimate in racism and genocide the ultimate in racism. Zionazi Zionism is genocidal racism and Nazism without gas chambers but as realized in an endlessly ethnically cleansing and US-backed Apartheid Israel having 90 nuclear weapons, one of the world’s leading high technology militaries, having world-leading high technology arms and surveillance industries that exports to dictatorships and democracies alike, and having attacked the territory of 20 countries.\n\nAppallingly, Trump is now seeking to widen the membership and global scope of the Trump Board of Peace (BOP) at the expense of the United Nations. Leaders of about 60 countries have received invitations from U.S. President Donald Trump to join the Trump-led and International Law-violating Board of Peace and 26 have already accepted including ICC-sought war criminal and mass murderer of children and mothers, Apartheid Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu.[62, 63]. In a puerile temper tantrum, childish but World-threatening narcissist Trump dis-invited Canada [62] after Canadian PM Mark Carney won a standing ovation at Davos for advocating the primacy of the United Nations and International Law [80, 81] (psychopathic war criminal Trump has demanded US acquisition of Canada as well as Venezuela, Greenland, Panama and Gaza). \n\nCanadian PM Mark Carney: “Today I will talk about a rupture in the world order, the end of a pleasant fiction and the beginning of a harsh reality, where geopolitics, where the large, main power, geopolitics, is submitted to no limits, no constraints. On the other hand, I would like to tell you that the other countries, especially intermediate powers like Canada, are not powerless. They have the capacity to build a new order that encompasses our values, such as respect for human rights, sustainable development, solidarity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the various states. The power of the less power starts with honesty” [81].\n\nIn stark contrast is Canada’s sister British Commonwealth country, Australia, that has been invited to join the BOP by Trump but is still considering the matter. The cowardly, racist, unprincipled, US lackey and Zionist-perverted Australian Labor Government knows what is right under International Law but is terrified of offending psychopath Trump. The Australian Labor Government and the Coalition Opposition are complicit in the Gaza Genocide in 20 ways [82] and lie for Apartheid Israel in 35 ways [83, 84]. The recent horrific Bondi Massacre (15 killed, all but 1 Jewish) gave a huge impetus to Zionist-perverted Labor’s 2-year campaign to hide the Gaza Genocide by means of antisemitism hysteria and terror hysteria. The Labor Government and the Liberal part of the Liberal Party-National Party Coalition Opposition have passed a draconian and Nazi-style Hate Speech Law (HSL) that enables a Federal Government to proscribe law-abiding groups it doesn’t like on secret Intelligence advice with leaders of such groups (e.g. quite conceivably the anti-racist, anti-genocide and anti-Zionist Jewish Council of Australia) facing up to 15 years in prison [79].\n\nThe progressive Greens and the libertarian but Right-wing National Party opposes this unforgivable and huge assault on Australian free speech and human rights. I sent the following Letter to Australian MSM: “[Top barrister and former national president of the Australian Lawyers Alliance] Greg Barns SC on Australia’s human rights-violating Hate Speech Law (HSL): “Bad laws are the worst sort of tyranny – and this one ticks every box”. In short, the Federal Government can proscribe any group it doesn’t like based on secret Intelligence advice, and leading members of the group will face up to 15 years’ prison. Zionist-perverted and Australia-betraying Liberal and Labor (Lib-Lab) MPs voted for the draconian HSL, Hate Speech Law to HASSLE Australians that was opposed by the Greens and Nationals but fanatically supported by racist Zionists (0.5% of the population and fervent supporters of Australia-violating Apartheid Israel and hence of vile Apartheid). 2 decades ago the ABC let me make 3 nation-wide broadcasts but never mentioned me since. Since the Gaza Genocide (875,000 killed) commenced on 7/10/2023 I sent thousands of protesting Letters to Mainstream media with a publication success of 0.1%, but in August-September 2025 an astonishing 100% of my 10 Letters to esteemed Pearls and Irritations were published. However after 6/9/2025 zero (0) of my Letters were published by Australian media. Who’s responsible: Intelligence “D-notices”, VIPs, or Zionists? I have joined about 40 censored Australian writers that I have defended. Informed democracy?” [85]. Cowardly, racist, US lackey and Zionist-perverted Australia has invited mass murderer, anti-Arab anti-Semite, and genocidal war criminal Apartheid Israeli President Isaac Herzog to Australia [86]. \n\nArticles 55 and 56 of the Fourth Geneva Convention unequivocally demand that an Occupier must provide life-sustaining food and medical services to its Occupied Subjects “to the fullest extent of the means available to it” [87]. Apartheid Israel has grossly violated the Fourth Geneva Convention in the Occupied Palestinian Territory for 59 years, and most egregiously so in the ongoing Gaza Genocide (875,000 Gazans killed by violence and deprivation [73-79]. The Office of the UN Human Rights Commissioner on the demand by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for the self-government of the Occupied Palestinian Territory: “Israel and other UN Member States must immediately comply with the authoritative determination by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Israel’s presence in the occupied Palestinian territory, independent human rights experts said today. The landmark ruling of 19 July 2024 declared that Israel’s occupation of the Gaza strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is unlawful, along with the associated settlement regime, annexation and use of natural resources. The Court added that Israel’s legislation and measures violate the international prohibition on racial segregation and apartheid. The ICJ mandated Israel to end its occupation, dismantle its settlements, provide full reparations to Palestinian victims and facilitate the return of displaced people” [7-9].\n\nPresently genocidal psychopath Trump rules half of Gaza and ICC-sought genocidal psychopath Netanyahu rules the other half. The killing continues. Psychopath Trump and his criminal Zionist associates should have nothing to do with devastated Gaza. They should be immediately replaced by a representative civilian Gazan government, and UN-backed humanitarian managers and workers protected by a UN force from countries with no genocidal record and ideally Muslim and Arabic-speaking to facilitate their protection of the devastated. Muslim and Arabic-speaking Gaza population.\n\nThe century-long and Zionist-imposed genocide of the Indigenous Palestinians has been associated with 3.1 million deaths from violence (0.3 million) and deprivation (2.8 million) – a Palestinian Genocide and a Palestinian Holocaust of a similar magnitude to the WW2 Jewish Holocaust (5-6 million deaths from violence and deprivation). The World must act to remove this horrific ongoing stain on Humanity. After 69 Africans were killed in the Sharpeville Massacre in South Africa in 1960 the World immediately imposed ultimately successful Sanctions on Apartheid South Africa. The US and Zionist Israeli murder of 875,000 Gazans vastly more so demands that comprehensive Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) should be applied to Apartheid Israel, Zionist-perverted America and all supporters of Apartheid Israel and hence of the utterly vile and deadly crime of Apartheid.\n\nThe World must insist on “all human rights for all” and immediate action to stop the immense suffering, deprivation and death in Gaza that is still being imposed by genocidally racist US and Zionist Israeli perpetrators. It is intolerable that the genocidal Zionist perpetrators remain in charge of Zionist-devastated Gaza. The civilized world must apply draconian sanctions against the perpetrators of the Gaza Holocaust, namely Apartheid Israel, the United States and all other Gaza Genocide-complicit countries. Inaction is complicity. Peace is the only way but silence kills and silence is complicity. All human rights for all. MAGA: Make America Genocide-Accountable, Make Apartheid Israel Genocide-Accountable.\n\nReferences.\n\n[1].

Josh Shapiro says he pulled out of the process to become former Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate before she settled on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz after determining he would not be a good fit for the role.\n\nThe revelation was included in Shapiro's memoir, a copy of which USA TODAY obtained. The book that mixes anecdotes about politics and his Jewish faith, “Where We Keep the Light: Stories From a Life of Service,” will be released on Jan. 27.\n\nIn it, Shapiro, who's up for reelection this fall, offers new details about his conversations with Harris, who he briefly considered challenging for the nomination, as well as former President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump.\n\nShapiro, a top surrogate for Biden before he dropped out, also hints at his own future political plans.\n\nThe prospective 2028 Democratic presidential candidate presents himself as willing to go \"against the grain\" and \"say the quiet part out loud,\" even when those positions may be unpopular. Shapiro says he's always been willing to make a choice and execute it.\n\nHe has been willing to pay the political price, \"if there was one,\" Shapiro, 52, adds, \"though truthfully, what usually happened was that I was able to lead people to where I was or at least lead them more in my direction.\"\n\nCollapse of Biden's campaign\n\nShapiro's book offers a contrast, and a rebuttal, at points to Harris' own campaign memoir, \"107 Days,\" which published in 2025. Harris wrote about the \"recklessness\" of top Biden aides, herself included, who wouldn't tell the president he should not seek reelection.\n\nBiden administration officials were gossiping about him behind his back months before he bowed out of the race, Shapiro said.\n\nAt a White House state dinner that Shapiro attended in April 2024, he said Biden aides inquired about the situation on the ground in Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state. Shapiro says he gave them his honest assessment: Biden was down and falling.\n\nBiden's horrendous June debate only drove home the point. Shapiro said that by then he \"was starting to feel real doubt about how Biden would win\" but he did not think that any politician would be \"able to leapfrog\" over the sitting vice president to accept the party's nomination.\n\nWhen the president and first lady visited Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the state capital, Shapiro joined them for coffee. Biden asked how he was doing in Pennsylvania. Shapiro says he told Biden there \"were a lot of people who thought it was best for him to get out of the race\" and shared internal polling to make his point. Biden rejected it.\n\nThe conversation was respectful and cordial, he said. Biden is a \"good man\" and \"an honorable person.\"\n\nNot the 'right time' for Shapiro\n\nWhen Biden did finally drop out, Shapiro says he asked himself, \"Well, now what? Maybe there would be a process the party would engage in to replace him? Did I want to be part of that?\"\n\nHis wife, Lori, did not favor his getting in the race.\n\n“I don’t think we are ready to do this,\" she said. \"It’s not the right time for our family. And it’s not on our terms.”\n\nShapiro says that although he still considered it, he ultimately agreed with his wife. Not long after, Harris called him and asked for his support.\n\nAs the moderate governor of a large swing state, Shapiro's name immediately rose to the top of the list of Harris' possible running mates. Her campaign manager called on her behalf to see if he was interested in being vetted.\n\nLori had misgivings, as did he. \"I knew that despite the honor of it, it just didn’t feel right for some reason,\" Shapiro writes.\n\nHarris' lawyers focused on policy areas where they differed. He says that Harris' team pressed him on his support for law enforcement. He said he told them his bipartisan appeal was a huge reason he'd been elected.\n\n\"They were questioning my ideology, my approach, my world view,\" he said. \"Again, it was their right to do so, but the manner in which they did suggested to me that they really didn’t understand where the people who would decide this presidential election really were.\"\n\nHarris team asked if Shapiro was 'an agent of Israel'\n\nIn one of their later sessions, he says, Harris' team zeroed in on Israel. They took issue with his aggressive response to pro-Palestinian protesters at the University of Pennsylvania and worried about how his stances might play in Michigan, a swing state that has a large Arab-American population.\n\n\"I wondered whether these questions were being posed to just me — the only Jewish guy in the running — or if everyone who had not held a federal office was being grilled about Israel in the same way,\" he said.\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who's Jewish, was also considered. He has said little about what took place when he was vetted. Shapiro volunteered at an Israeli army base in high school and worked at the Israeli embassy in Washington early in his career.\n\nShapiro said their questions added to his growing sense that he wasn't the right fit for the ticket. Members of team suggested he pull out of the process before he met with Harris. His wife encouraged him to talk to the vice president, he said, telling him he'd regret it if he didn't.\n\nOn his way to meet with Harris in Washington, he says her team asked him, if he'd ever \"been an agent of the Israeli government\" or communicated with an undercover agent of Israel.\n\nShapiro was flabbergasted and offended. \"If they were undercover, I responded, how the hell would I know?\"\n\nWhile he waited for Harris at the Naval Observatory, Shapiro says he engaged in small talk with a member of the staff. Harris wrote in her book that he was measuring the drapes and counting bedrooms. Shapiro says his comments were misrepresented. He was trying to determine whether his children would be comfortable calling the house their home.\n\nWhen he finally spoke to Harris, she told him that if he were chosen, she'd expect his total focus. Shapiro said he told her she'd have his full commitment but he still had a state to run. Harris asked if he'd be willing to apologize for previous statements he'd made about the protesters. He told her he would not.\n\nShe shared with him then that her vice presidency had been tough, laying out some of the complaints about Biden's senior staff and their insular decision-making process that she'd go on to detail in her book. \"I was surprised by how much she seemed to dislike the role,\" he said.\n\nShapiro laid out his own expectations for the job. He wanted to be a partner to Harris, and to know she'd take his input seriously.\n\n\"She was crystal clear that that was not what she was looking for. I would primarily work with her staff. She couldn’t say to me that I would have that kind of access to her.\"\n\nTo Harris' credit, he writes, she was honest. After the meeting they had him wait at former Attorney General Eric Holder's apartment in Washington. Eventually, one of the vice president's lawyers, Dana Remus, showed up and told Shapiro she could tell he didn't want the job. Moving to Washington would be hard for him and the role would be a financial strain. His wife would have get a new wardrobe and pay for professional hair and makeup. The couple would also have to foot the bill for food and entertainment.\n\n\"I was a little slack-jawed. The comments were unkind to me. They were nasty to Lori,\" he said.\n\nShapiro says that after returning home and weighing his options with his wife he decided he didn't want the job. He called Remus and told her he was withdrawing. He wanted to personally tell Harris.\n\n\"She then told me that the VP would not handle bad news well and that I shouldn’t push. At that point, I left it to the VP’s team to let her know about what I had decided.\"\n\nHarris called two days later to say she'd officially chosen Walz. \"She could not have been nicer,\" Shapiro writes.\n\nShapiro says he wasn't sure if Remus had told Harris that he withdrew and he did not ask.\n\nHarris would write later in her own memoir that Shapiro was \"poised, polished and personable,\" but he seemed reluctant not to be in command.\n\nSources familiar with the process told USA TODAY at the time that Shapiro tried to negotiate a policy portfolio for himself. It was evident from his vetting interview that it would be a bad match, they said. His perceived ambitions and his strong connection to his Jewish identity and how it informed his views on Israel were also prominent issues in the competition to become Harris’ running mate\n\nThe Obama factor\n\nShapiro's faith was a draw for another prominent Democrat who ran for president almost two decades earlier.\n\nHe was one of Barack Obama's earliest Pennsylvania endorsers in the 2008 presidential primary, in which the former Illinois lawmaker pulled off an upset against Hillary Clinton.\n\nShapiro came to Obama's defense during the primary campaign after Obama's former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, made anti-Israel and antisemitic comments. Shapiro appeared at synagogues and community events on Obama's behalf and convened a listening session for him with prominent Jewish leaders.\n\n\"Privately, I was fielding a bunch of calls from donors who were nervous about his support of Israel, but I felt comfortable defending his beliefs. I thought the attacks were unfair. I believed in his message, and I thought that he would make a better President,\" Shapiro said.\n\nShapiro's rhetorical style has been compared to Obama's, and the former president has admitted in the past he's a fan.\n\nObama campaigned for Shapiro when he ran for governor in 2022, appearing at a rally alongside him, Biden and future Sen. John Fetterman shortly before the election.\n\nShapiro's speech came earlier than Obama's at the event, which he admits was an intimidating position to be in. After the former president spoke, Shapiro said, he came backstage and \"gave me a little bro hug.\"\n\n“'Yo man,' he said into my ear,“ Shapiro writes, of Obama. \"'I was listening to your speech. It was damn good. There’s something to that.'\n\n\"It’s a moment I still carry with me,\" Shapiro continues. \"I keep that photo of our embrace in my office, too.\"\n\nLiving 'in a bubble'\n\nShapiro and his family were sleeping upstairs when a Molotov cocktail came through the window of the governor's residence during the Passover holiday in 2025. For the first time, he realized people were trying to kill him.\n\nTrump took a week to call after the arson. When Trump finally called from his personal cellphone, Shapiro did not answer because he didn't recognize the number. Trump left him a voicemail telling him to call anytime. \"Just a terrible situation,\" Trump said.\n\nShapiro called him back. Trump answered right away. He says he raised some issues that were important to his state during the call, including steelworker jobs in Pittsburgh.\n\nHe says Trump brought up the 2028 presidential race and the Democratic Party's bench. \"He said he liked the way I talked to people and approached problems.\"\n\nHe says Trump, who faced his own near assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July 2024, also told him he \"shouldn’t want to be President, given how dangerous it had become to hold the office now.\"","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/01/24/josh-shapiro-kamala-harris-book/88316678007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/23/USAT/88327419007-20240713-t-205803-z-2114817288-rc-2-ku-8-akmtvy-rtrmadp-3-usaelectionharris.JPG?auto=webp&crop=5499,3093,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 06:00:31","author":"Usa Today","authors":["Usa Today"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.179},{"id":395582950,"title":"5-Year-Old Detained by ICE in Minnesota, Sparking Outrage Over US Immigration Practices","text":"Federal immigration agents in Minnesota have taken into custody a five-year-old boy, Liam Conejo Ramos, along with his father, igniting widespread outrage and fuelling debate over enforcement tactics used in recent immigration operations. \n\nThe detention occurred on 20 January in the Minneapolis suburb of Columbia Heights, when agents stopped the family as they arrived home from preschool, according to school officials and the family’s lawyer. \n\nLiam and his father were subsequently taken to a family detention centre in Dilley, Texas, more than 1 200 miles away, because part of a broader enforcement surge that officials say has included roughly 3 000 arrests in the region over the past several weeks. \n\nColumbia Heights Public Schools Superintendent Zena Stenvik described the scene to reporters, saying agents removed the boy from a still-running car and then instructed him to knock on the front door of his home to see if others were inside – an action she described as “essentially using a five-year-old as bait.” Offers from neighbours or district staff to care for Liam during the encounter were reportedly refused by agents, heightening community grief and concern. \n\nThe family – originally from Ecuador – arrived in the United States in 2024 and has an active asylum case, with no deportation order issued at the time, according to school officials and legal representatives. \n\nDiverse Reactions and Official Responses\n\nSchool officials, parents and community leaders have reacted with shock and dismay. Superintendent Stenvik questioned the necessity and humanity of detaining such a young child. \n\n“Why detain a five-year-old?” she asked, stressing that the family had complied with legal processes. Teachers described Liam as a bright and caring pupil whose classmates and staff miss him. \n\nAcross the political spectrum, reactions varied. Former US Vice-President Kamala Harris condemned the incident as an example of disturbing Trump-era immigration enforcement, calling the tactic unacceptable and urging greater protection for families and children. \n\nHer comments highlighted broader Democratic concerns over the treatment of migrant families. \n\nAt the federal level, Vice-President JD Vance and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) offered a contrasting account. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin emphasised that “ICE did NOT target a child,” saying the agency’s operation was aimed at arresting Liam’s father, who she described as in the United States without lawful status. \n\nAccording to the official account, the father fled on foot during the operation, leaving his son behind; an agent remained with the boy for “his safety” while the arrest was completed. McLaughlin added that ICE policy allows parents to choose whether to remain in custody with their children or designate another caregiver. \n\nSome Republican voices echoed this defence, with Vance questioning critics and stressing that law enforcement cannot ignore legal obligations to pursue people wanted for removal even when families are involved.\n\nBut critics have argued that the official narrative does not fully explain why another adult at the scene – who offered to care for Liam – was not allowed to take the child. The family’s lawyer and advocates maintain that the detention was unnecessary, painful and potentially harmful to the boy’s emotional well-being. \n\nBroader Context\n\nThis incident is not isolated. School officials say at least four children connected to the Columbia Heights public school district – including a 10-year-old and two 17-year-olds – have been detained by immigration agents in recent weeks during intensified enforcement in Minnesota. \n\nSome arrests occurred as students were arriving at school or alone, raising fears among parents and educators. \n\nThe uptick in arrests has reportedly contributed to declining school attendance, as families fear walking children to school amid what some describe as an omnipresent federal enforcement presence in neighbourhoods. \n\nParents have shared stories of anxiety, disrupted routines and trust erosion in public institutions meant to support their children. \n\nCivil rights organisations and immigrant advocacy groups have called for independent investigations into ICE conduct and increased oversight of immigration enforcement practices, especially where minors are concerned. \n\nHuman rights lawyers note that media images emerging from the episode – including one showing Liam in a hat looking bewildered – have resonated widely and intensified outcry from both domestic and international observers. \n\nAdditional support efforts, such as a GoFundMe campaign launched to aid the family’s legal fight and reunification efforts, have rapidly raised well over $100 000, underscoring the strong public response.\n\nThe Logical Indian’s Perspective\n\nThe distressing image of a young child caught up in an immigration raid forces a broader ethical reflection: where should society draw the line between enforcing law and upholding the dignity and safety of children? \n\nRegardless of one’s stance on immigration policy, the emotional and psychological impact on children – especially those legally seeking refuge – cannot be dismissed as collateral. A peaceful, empathetic society values both the rule of law and the protection of the vulnerable.\n\nThe debate in the United States over immigration enforcement tactics reveals a profound tension between governmental authority and community trust. \n\nPolicies that inadvertently harm children risk deepening social fractures and eroding belief in institutions meant to serve and protect all residents. \n\nIn line with The Logical Indian’s commitment to compassion, coexistence, and constructive dialogue, we must advocate for humane frameworks that respect legal structures without compromising on human dignity.","summary":"The detention of a five-year-old asylum-seeking child during a Minnesota immigration arrest has ignited outrage, political sparring and renewed scrutiny of how US enforcement treats vulnerable families.","url":"https://thelogicalindian.com/5-year-old-detained-by-ice-in-minnesota-sparking-outrage-over-us-immigration-practices/","image":"https://thelogicalindian.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Copy-of-Social-Thumbnail-Template-12-7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 05:00:31","author":"Syed Muskan Shafiq","authors":["Syed Muskan Shafiq"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.127},{"id":395558754,"title":"Defiant protests over US immigration crackdown, child's detention","text":"MINNEAPOLIS — Thousands of people braved icy conditions on Friday to protest the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis and businesses closed their doors amid anger over the detention of a five-year-old migrant boy.Dozens of eateries, attraction sites and other businesses shuttered as part of a day of coordinated action to defy the weeks-long federal immigration operation underway in Minnesota.Images of an apparently terrified pre-schooler, Liam Conejo Ramos, being held by immigration officers who were seeking to arrest the boy's father have rekindled public outrage at the federal crackdown, during which an agent shot and killed a US citizen.The superintendent of Columbia Heights Public Schools, where Ramos was a preschool student, said the child and his Ecuadoran father, Adrian Conejo Arias — both asylum seekers — were taken from their driveway as they arrived home on Tuesday.Ramos was then used as 'bait' by officers to draw out those inside his home, superintendent Zena Stenvik added.One protester, who declined to be named, told AFP he was marching 'because if we don't fight, we don't win.

In an unprecedented development, a 5-year-old preschooler named Liam Conejo Ramos was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents as he was coming back home from school. Caught on camera just steps away from the boy's home, the haunting scene was ultimately circulated all over the Internet. The visuals set against the fiercely cold and snow-covered backdrop of Columbia Heights, a suburb in Minneapolis, captured the young boy bundled up in winter clothes, a blue knit bunny hat with floppy ears. Even top politicians in the US couldn't take their eyes off the heart-rending picture of 5-year-old Liam Ramos' Spider-Man backpack's handle being held by a masked federal agent. Standing in the street, the preschooler is pictured staring ahead with a blank look as his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, is also taken into federal custody. From the driveway of their home in suburban Minneapolis, the father-son duo was transported on a plane to a family detention facility in Texas. Just 20 minutes later, Liam's brother, a middle schooler, came home to find his father and brother missing.

The incident incited yet another discordant clash between the left and right over two weeks after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis. School official says 5-year-old was 'used as bait' At a press conference held after Liam and his father were detained, the superintendent of the school district in Columbia Heights, a Minneapolis suburb, publicly revealed that the 5-year-old was the fourth child from the school district to be taken away by immigration authorities in over just two weeks. ICE agents in Minnesota grabbed 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos in his driveway as he returned from school with his father.Another adult who lives in the home was outside and begged to take the child, but agents refused and instead used the boy as bait to knock on doors to see if… pic.twitter.com/HbW8KfHPau— Republicans against Trump (@RpsAgainstTrump) January 22, 2026 Superintendent Zena Stenvik, who claims to have visited Liam's home after learning of the detentions, said that an agent had pulled the young boy out of the car. He is said to have been told to knock at his own door to \"see if anyone else was home – essentially using a five-year-old as bait,\" as per the school official's statement at the conference. Stenvik further shared that another adult present at the premises was outside during the encounter and pleaded to take care of Liam. Despite their attempts to prevent the boy's detention, they were denied any respite, as per the superintendent's account. How did Homeland Security respond to Liam Ramos' ICE detention? Department of Homeland Security's assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement on Wednesday night, saying that ICE was conducting a \"targeted operation\" to apprehend Liam's father. She has since described the 5-year-old boy's father an \"illegal alien.\" Further re-asserting, she said, \"ICE did NOT target a child,\" alleging Liam's father \"fled on foot - abandoning his child.\" As far as the official DHS stance goes, \"For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended [his father].\" McLaughlin also maintained, \"Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children, or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates.\" Despite school officials suggesting that an adult in Liam Ramos' home had said they would take the child, while another relative outside had \"begged\" to take him, Laughlin contradicted the claims. Per her account, officers tried to get the 5-year-old's mother to take him, but she refused. Marcos Charles, the acting executive associate director of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, in turn, similarly maintained that his officers did everything to reunite Liam Ramos with his family. On Friday, senior Homeland Security officials offered an update on Liam's situation after his detention had incited inflammatory outrage by officials and netizens alike. At a news conference outside Minneapolis, Gregory Bovino, who is leading President Trump's Border Patrol operations, said the 5-year-old was being \"well cared for\" in a Texas detention centre with his father. \"That child is in the least restrictive setting possible,\" the Border Patrol official shared, as per the New York Times. Further defending the federal authorities in light of Tuesday's detention, he said ICE officer and Border Patrol agents are \"experts in dealing with children. Not because we want to be, but because we have to be.\" The agency also claimed officers \"took care of the child, got him McDonald’s and played him his favourite music to comfort him.\" ALSO READWho is Nekima Levy Armstrong? Minnesota civil rights activist arrested after anti-ICE church protest Liam Ramos' immigration status revealed According to CNN, the family's lawyer, Marc Prokosch, has since disclosed that Liam and his family's origins trace back to Ecuador. He further detailed that the family was pursuing asylum claims and had presented itself to border officials in Texas in December 2024 despite the DHS labelling him an \"illegal alien.\" Their claims of pursuing a legal process to obtain status in the US were, however, still pending. \"These are not illegal aliens,\" their lawyer stated, as per CNN. \"They were following all the established protocols, pursuing their claim for asylum, showing up for their court hearings, and posed no safety, no flight risk and never should have been detained.\" Meanwhile, Pastor Sergio Amezcua, who has been helping Liam's mother since the detention said that the woman was simply \"terrified\" to step out because of the agents outside her door, according to CNN. \"ICE agents were trying to use the baby to get her to come out of her house, but the neighbors … advised her not to do it,\" Amezcua highlighted. ICE backlash grows after child's detention Amid exacerbated tensions over the Trump administration immigration operation in Minneapolis, former US Vice President Kamala Harris joined the ranks of people outraged by the child's detainment. In an X post, Harris wrote, \"Liam Ramos is just a baby. He should be at home with his family, not used as bait by ICE and held in a Texas detention center.\" \"I am outraged, and you should be too,\" she added. A horrific smear. ICE did NOT target, arrest a child or use a child as “bait.” ICE law enforcement officers were the only people primarily concerned with the welfare of this child. The father and alleged mother abandoned the child. Agitators scared the child. On January… https://t.co/aoyxkOnSOl— Tricia McLaughlin (@TriciaOhio) January 23, 2026 Tricia McLaughin has since responded to Harris' tweet as well, calling it a \"horrific smear,\" as officials maintain that the ICE did not target or Liam Ramos as \"bait.\" Hillary Clinton also took to her X account this week and said: \"Enforcing the law is one thing. Terrorising a population, using children as pawns, is another. My heart aches for Liam Ramos and his family.\" US Senator Tammy Duckworth wrote online: \"ICE snatched him and his father on the way home from school, then used him as bait to target his family. A family who followed the rules. A child as bait. Their cruelty knows no end.\" As established by aforementioned statements, federal authorities have vehemently spoken out against backlash arising from the left. Even Vice President JD Vance joined the DHS in defending ICE's action, pressing that the officers were targeting the boy's father over his undocumented status in the US. \"Are they supposed to let a five-year-old child freeze to death?\" he said on Thursday after a closed-door meeting in Minneapolis with federal agents and others. \"If the argument is that you can’t arrest people who have violated the law because they have children, then every single parent is going to be completely given immunity from every being the subject of law enforcement.\"","url":"https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/us-news/was-5-year-old-liam-ramos-used-as-bait-ice-reveals-why-minnesota-boy-was-detained/4117832/","image":"https://images.financialexpressdigital.com/2026/01/liam-ramos-ice-5-year-old-detain.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 04:38:24","author":"Ashima Grover","authors":["Ashima Grover"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.553},{"id":395688148,"title":"Defiant Protests Over Child's Detention By ICE Amid US Immigration Crackdown","text":"Thousands of people braved icy conditions on Friday to protest the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, and businesses closed their doors amid anger over the detention of a five-year-old migrant boy.\n\nDozens of eateries, attraction sites and other businesses shuttered as part of a day of coordinated action to defy the weeks-long federal immigration operation underway in Minnesota.\n\n Stay up to date with the latest news.

And “the effects reverberate” big-time, as AI systems “draw from these compromised articles.” Thus “source reliability becomes another front in the battle,” with pro-regime Wiki insiders “making small edits over time that gradually erode entire sections.” This is what “authoritarian information warfare looks like in 2026,” as Iran kills protesters then “erases the evidence that they existed at all.”\n\nFrom the right: Twin-City Textbook Insurrection\n\n“All the evidence indicates that an insurrection is taking place in Minneapolis,” warns The Federalist’s Breccan F. Thies, and “this one has real violence, real obstruction of official proceedings, real consequences, and actual intent.” More, it “has actual institutional support” from major elected officials. “Minneapolis always seems to be the powder keg pushing the brink of civil war” because “the left-wing protests, riots, and militant violence at work there are not organic”; rather, they’re promoted by local institutions of power that “give political and legal cover to their henchmen-acolytes.” The government must “investigate and punish insurrections” because the “other option is mob rule.”\n\nProtest beat: $ for ‘Extrademocratic Disruptions’\n\nThe Democratic Party “is configured” to respond unreasonably “to everything President Trump does,” thanks largely to a “Byzantine network of activist nonprofits” created by “liberal foundations and progressive billionaires,” laments The Wall Street Journal’s Barton Swain. Particularly since the George Floyd riots, “the progressive donor class has spread its largess to advocacy and activist organizations pushing social justice, immigrant rights, Palestinian statehood, LGBTQ rights, indigenous people’s rights” and climate. For these fat cats — George Soros, Michael Bloomberg, Jeff Bezos’ ex-wife MacKenzie Scott — “climate change and, later, systemic racism and abortion restrictions and Israeli ‘genocide’ were all existential menaces requiring marches and sit-ins and other extrademocratic disruptions. It amounts to a subtler and more effective attack on democracy than anything Mr. Trump has attempted.”\n\nHate patrol: Shapiro Won’t Back Down\n\n“Kamala Harris’s vetting team asked” Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro if he’d been “an agent of the Israeli government,” grumbles Commentary’s Seth Mandel of an incident revealed in the gov’s new book. Wow: The Harris campaign’s “attack on Shapiro is an attack on American Jewry.” He’s not telling all now to show his “toughness and nerve,” but to warn he’s not “letting them take free shots at the Jews.” Shapiro is daring “to center his Jewish pride at a moment when so many progressive activists and organizers are out for Jewish blood. It contradicts the conventional wisdom.” Look out: “Shapiro didn’t ask for this fight, but he’s not running from it.” He can’t back down because “the next generation of American Jewish activists and politicians are watching.”\n\nConservative: Trump’s Landmark Crime Stance\n\nNot until Donald Trump “has a president commented with such urgency” on acts of crime that lack “political significance,” notes City Journal’s Heather Mac Donald. His “words break through the complacency that now treats violence as an inevitable fact of urban life.” Personally affronted by grotesque acts of “street crime,” Trump disregards “presidential norms ofrhetorical restraint” in favor of an “unmediated relationship to events.” His “attempts to sic the National Guard” on crime-ridden cities “have deterred crime through their physical presence,” though only as a “short-term fix.” But Trump’s “lack of proposed” national legislation is less important than his “inclination to lay down a philosophical marker: violence is not normal.","summary":"“Iranian security forces have killed up to 20,000 protesters since December 2025,” notes Ashley Rindsberg at The Free Press.","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/01/23/opinion/irans-wiki-weaponized-info-war-twin-city-textbook-insurrection-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/doedl.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 01:40:37","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.477},{"id":395530530,"title":"Kamala Harris Slams ICE Over Detention of Five-Year-Old Child in Texas","text":"Washington DC: Former US Vice President Kamala Harris has sharply criticised the American Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after a five-year-old child was taken to a detention centre in Texas.In a post on X, Harris said the child should be at home with the family and “not used as bait by ICE and held in a Texas detention center.” She added, “I am outraged, and you should be too.”Responding to Harris’s remarks, Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, rejected the allegation that ICE used the child as bait.

During the operation, she added, agitators gathered at the scene, shouting and blowing horns, which frightened the child.“Our officers’ primary concern during the entire operation was the safety and welfare of the child,” McLaughlin said. She stated that officers followed the father’s wishes, ensured the child’s comfort, bought him food, and played his favourite music.

He's another one of those Cabinet picks who just seems to be perfect for the job. \n\nHe was in Davos this week at the World Economic Forum, along with President Donald Trump. \n\nNow, California Gov. Gavin Newsom was there as well, trying to act like a national leader, but only managing to look desperate for attention.\n\nAs we reported, Bessent had a little fun with Newsom, referring to him as a cross between Patrick Bateman and Sparkle Beach Ken, and the only person in his state who knows less about economics than Kamala Harris. Talk about right on the money. \n\nBessent went on to list some of the things, from homelessness to the Palisades fire, that Newsom had failed on, as he spends his time trying to raise his national profile. \n\nREAD MORE: Watch: Bessent Eviscerates Newsom in Savage Davos Take-Down – 'Patrick Bateman Meets Sparkle Beach Ken'\n\nMeanwhile, Newsom made some weird remarks about Trump being a T.rex. He also waved around some kneepads, claiming they were for foreign dignitaries interacting with Trump. \n\n\"This is diplomacy with Donald Trump. He's a T.rex. You mate with him, or he devours you, one or the other,\" Newsom said Tuesday. \"The Europeans could be (devoured) if they continue down this path and process. They need to stand tall, stand firm, stand united.\"\n\nI don't think that he gets people want someone standing up for America, like a T.rex. Newsom naturally was taking the position of standing up against our present government overseas. Because of course he is. Not a good look. \n\nBessent then had more to say about him. \n\n\"I think Gavin Newsom may be cracking up with some of these things he's saying. I think he may be in over his hairdo.And being on the national stage is very different than being governor of California with no signature achievements, but to say strange things, like President Trump is a Tyrannosaurus rex, what the hell does that mean? I could say, Gavin Newsom is a brontosaurus with a brain the size of a walnut. And if you brought the kneepads, maybe that was for his meeting with Alex Soros.\"\n\nOof, don't hold back there, Bessent. Dude is just savage; that \"in over his hairdo\" crack is great. But it goes to the greater point when it comes to Newsom - there's nothing there but hair gel. What policy can he point to that has made things better for the people of California? You can already tell that he's more focused on his campaign than the state he's supposed to be in charge of. \n\nThat's all Newsom has - rich donor buddies. And those are the Democrats' top choices at the moment - this guy and Kamala Harris? No wonder the Democrats are already flipping out and pre-attacking Vice President JD Vance. They know how up a creek they are. \n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy RedState’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

Here's how the Washington Post reported it yesterday.\n\nFive-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, whom the Department of Homeland Security identified as Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias in an emailed statement, were detained in their driveway Tuesday afternoon, just as they were returning from the child’s school, according to a news release from Columbia Heights Public Schools.The father fled on foot when ICE officers approached him, DHS said. “For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias,” it added.After detaining the father, ICE officers then asked Liam to knock on the door to see if any other people were inside the home, “using a 5-year-old as bait,” according to the school district.Another adult living in the home, who was outside at the time, “begged the agents” to leave the child with them, the school district said. ICE agents refused.\n\nNo one disputes that Adrian Arias fled the scene, leaving his child in the driveway. And no one disputes that ICE agents took the child to the door of the house. But the characterization of ICE using him as \"bait\" is disputed. This comes from someone at the school district who assumed Liam Ramos was brought to the door so that his mother would open the door at which point she would also be arrested by ICE. But ICE disputes that. Here's DHS's response to the post by Ken Martin denying the child was used as \"bait.\"\n\nYou’re lying for clicks yet again.ICE did not, and has never, \"used a child as bait.\" The child was ABANDONED.On January 20, ICE conducted a targeted operation to arrest Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias an illegal alien from Ecuador who was RELEASED into the U.S. by the Biden… https://t.co/bIdW7Wmx3j— U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (@ICEgov) January 22, 2026\n\nEarlier this morning, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin called this story a \"horrific smear.\" She said ICE tried to get his mother to take custody of the child but she refused.\n\nThis is a horrific smear pushed by the media and anti-ICE activists.The child was ABANDONDED by his father, and the alleged mother REFUSED to take custody of her own child. Our law enforcement took care of the child, got him McDonald’s and played him his favorite music to… pic.twitter.com/A6u9Wi9rfZ— Homeland Security (@DHSgov) January 23, 2026\n\nDid the mother really refuse to take custody of her son? CNN has a story up today suggesting that's true.\n\nDHS also said officers “made multiple attempts to get the mother inside the house to take custody of her child. Officers even assured her that they would NOT take her into custody. She refused to accept custody of the child.”But Liam’s mother, who is pregnant and also has a teenage son, was “terrified” of the agents outside her door, said Pastor Sergio Amezcua, who has been helping the mother since her husband and son were taken away.“ICE agents were trying to use the baby to get her to come out of her house, but the neighbors … advised her not to do it,” fearing she would be detained, Amezcua said.\n\nPator Amezcua was not present at the house. And the \"neighbors\" who were telling the mother not to open the door apparently included the boy's father: That's according to a school board member named Mary Granlund who was driving by at the time this all happneed.\n\nShe described a commotion at the scene, with onlookers telling agents: “What are you doing? Don’t take the child!”...When someone recognized the school board chair, Granlund said, they yelled: “The school is here! They can take the child. You don’t have to take them.”Liam’s mother looked out the window, Granlund said, but Liam’s father was yelling, “Please do not open the door! Don’t open the door!”\n\nTo sum all this up, ICE went looking for this individual from Ecuador who they say is here illegally. He and his son were outside in the driveway and when iCE approached the father ran for it. ICE then brought the boy to the door and asked the mother to open the door and take the child. At some point the father was captured and he and other people were telling the mother not to open the door for the boy. At this point, ICE took the father and son into custody and left (this is what is being described as kidnapping) and both were flown to a detention center for families in Texas.\n\nDad ran for it. Mom refused to open the door for him but ICE is to blame. That's how the left sees this.\n\nThere is also some debate about why ICE was targeting Adrian Arias in the first place. It doesn't appear that he has any criminal history or pending charges so it wasn't that. His attorney has claimed he followed the legal process to enter the country under the Biden administration but that is also being disputed by DHS, which claims they have no record of his entry.\n\nNEW: @FoxNews has obtained a DHS photo of ADRIAN ALEXANDER CONEJO ARIAS, the father of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos.

Donald Trump and company “don’t see these families as people, and that’s exactly how they’re treating them,” California Congressman Jimmy Gomez concluded. “How many children is ICE doing this to?” Virginia Representative James Walkinshaw asked. “We need an investigation, now.” The Democratic Party’s official social media organ agreed. “These monsters are sick,” read its denunciation of the law enforcement officers who used a child as “human bait.”\n\nAn equally accurate headline for this story would be \"Illegal immigrants flees ICE, leaving 5-year-old, then begs mother not to take him inside.\" Would that be fair to the father? Maybe not but it's as fair as the actual headlines the media is running are to ICE agents.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Hot Air's conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

Even if he still had a five o'clock shadow and a penis, his feelings are what mattered. That's why a guy who was caught pleasuring himself in a Planet Fitness women's restroom said criticism of his lewd act was \"transphobic\" — he identified as a woman, even though video shows he's clearly not. It's also why sex offender Richard Cox was able to enter female locker rooms in and around northern Virginia. Cox said he was a woman. \n\nIn several prisons in America, violent men are put in the same units as female inmates (including on mother-baby units) thanks to their \"gender identity,\" leading to the abuse of those female inmates and punishment from authorities when they speak out (or are victimized). At Framingham in Massachusetts, one inmate wrote, \"\"Many of us here are afraid to speak out due to the repercussions from the transgender population,\" the letter said. \"Most of the male inmates housed at MCI-Framingham still have intact male genitalia; two out of the ten have had surgery.\"\n\nThings are no better in the U.K., where NHS nurse Jennifer Melle was handed a victory in court after being racially abused by a \"trans-identifying man\" who said Melle \"misgendered\" him.\n\nThe point is this: for far too long, transgender activism has run roughshod over women and our rights. They've also pushed to do serious harm to children, which I don't want to minimize, but that's a topic for another column where it can get the attention it deserves. \n\nMany of us simply want a restoration of sanity, a world where women could be left alone in their safe spaces without intact men changing in front of us, and where our shelters and our prisons are single-sexed. We didn't get that, because the Left never takes an inch when they want a mile. They demanded \"inclusivity\" and \"tolerance\" while they erased women or broke us down to our most base biological functions.\n\nIt's part of why Donald Trump won reelection, and the cultural backlash is real. But what's not happening to trans people in America is this: they are not being genocided, and they do not qualify for asylum, in the Netherlands or elsewhere.\n\nBut one has to laugh at the fact they fled the U.S. only to end up in a camp somewhere in Europe.\n\nWhen your TDS convinces you to flee the United States to the Netherlands and you end up thrown in camps. pic.twitter.com/XQ926QBKD1— Sarah 🥨 (@cosmopterix) January 21, 2026\n\nHere's more from that Guardian article (emphasis added):\n\nTer Apel is not a prison, but it looks a little bit like one, surrounded by fences, with guards on every gate. Residents are free to come and go but must be in their rooms each morning for a bed check. After their first few days in the central reception area, asylum seekers are dispersed to different low-rise blocks, where they are given a small food allowance so they can cook their own meals.For Arc, that meant being transferred to what she calls “the queer block”, rather like a student halls of residence where all the LGBT asylum seekers are placed. There, she insists, sharing meals in the communal kitchens and over cigarettes outside, she found common ground.They all feared the police as well as their governments and fellow citizens, she said. “We were in danger from the people around us. And in fact, all of us thought of America as a place we wanted to live in – a beautiful country of opportunities. And that’s all still true, but it was surprising and sad and validating that the people there – a trans dude from Tehran and a trans woman from Libya – our stories were so similar.”Arc knows how that might sound. “I hear a lot of people saying: ‘You are an idiot. You came here from America.’ People will tell me: ‘Did you think about moving to California?’ And then I say: ‘Well, I lived in San Francisco’ and then they go: ‘Oh, that’s a heaven for gay people.’ But it’s different for trans people, particularly for trans women, to the extent that my experience in San Francisco, robot taxis aside, was indistinguishable from [that of] the people that I knew from Libya and Iran and Morocco and Algeria.”Trans men are also unsafe in the US, according to Ashe Wilde, another American who has been living in Ter Apel since the end of October. He transitioned in 2019 and anti-trans hate has only grown since then, he said, particularly with the return of Trump, who was re-elected using the attack ad: “Kamala Harris is for they/them. Trump is for you.”\n\nI'll start by pointing out that the Netherlands doesn't stick asylum seekers in fancy hotels on the taxpayers' dime. Asylum seekers get sent to a camp, often in tents, where they're given an allowance for food they have to cook for themselves. Yet I don't hear a single Leftist complaining about how inhumane those conditions are, like they do whenever we open a camp for migrants here.\n\nBut did you catch what Jane-Michelle Arc, a 47-year-old software engineer from San Francisco, said? He compared San Francisco to Libya, Iran, Morocco, and Algeria, places where homosexuality is not only outlawed but punishable by death. No gay or transperson has died on the streets of San Francisco because of their orientation and gender identity, and it's an insult to the memory of the gays who have died under those regimes to compare them to one of the most \"queer-friendly\" cities in the world.\n\nThere is no such thing as \"transphobia,\" and there is no anti-trans hatred. The Trump administration has made it clear that there are two genders, a biological reality (and here I thought the Left was all about \"following the science\"). Protecting children from mutilation and a lifetime of sexual dysfunction is also not \"anti-trans\" hate. Nor is barring men from women's sports and safe spaces \"anti-trans hate.\" The Left wanted to make all of us ignore biological reality and cater to the whims of a mentally ill minority that seems to have a propensity for violence.\n\nDemocrats insisted that Donald Trump and Mike Pence were going to round up the gays during his first term and put them in camps. That didn't happen, and yet they revisited those same talking points and upped the ante by releasing a study that says there's a \"genocidal process\" against trans people in America.\n\nThere isn't.\n\nBut as the original poster said, the Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS) is so strong that Leftists will put themselves in the camps they were trying to avoid here, and pretend they're the victims for it.\n\nOh, and this whole thing isn't going to go well for the trans asylum seekers. While they complain about how unfair and tough our immigration system is (it's actually very broken and easily exploited), the Dutch don't mess around and they don't fall for false asylum claims. In November of last year, they denied an asylum claim of a transgender American named Veronica Clifford-Carlos. The court said he \"did not show they are systematically denied protection or access to essential services.\"\n\nOne of the things Trump is very, very good at is getting his opponents to reveal just how unhinged and hypocritical they are, and how quickly they reflexively reject things they believed in and policy positions they once held simply because Trump now supports it. A decade ago, Pence was putting the gays in camps. Now the trans community is putting themselves in camps, hoping to escape the boogeyman they've created in their heads.\n\nThe irony is not lost on me.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/amy-curtis/2026/01/23/trans-people-netherlands-flee-trump-end-up-in-camps-n2669952","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/144/bc4b9b84-ae55-4694-8e77-8a0bbaa45d82.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-23 23:45:21","author":"Amy Curtis","authors":["Amy Curtis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":395520404,"title":"How Jasmine Crockett Shamelessly Turned A Viral ICE ‘Bait’ Story Into A ‘Kidnapping’ Claim","text":"My daughter is almost 17. She’s smart, empathetic and deeply tuned in to the world around her. Like a lot of teenagers, she gets much of her news from social media. And like a lot of parents, I found myself staring at the ceiling after something she brought up the other night at the dinner table, wondering how something so wrong could sound so convincing. She was trying to process something she had seen and read online. I listened to every word and stayed quiet, partly because I didn’t yet know the facts, and partly because I wanted to understand how the story had landed with her. The spark was a viral claim that ICE used a 5-year-old boy as \"bait\" to capture his father, who was in the country illegally. The images were emotional, the language inflammatory. And the framing was unmistakable: this wasn’t immigration enforcement, it was cruelty. Hillary Clinton said ICE was using children as \"pawns,\" and Kamala Harris echoed the \"bait\" term. Some went further. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a U.S. Senate hopeful, publicly described the incident as a \"kidnapping.\" That wasn’t a careless word choice. It was a loaded accusation, delivered without hesitation, and released into an ecosystem that rewards outrage far more than accuracy. From there, the escalation was predictable. Online, the comparisons piled up quickly: fascism, Nazis, Hitler. My daughter, trying to make sense of what she was being shown by people she’s been taught to trust, said it reminded her of the kinds of things Nazis had done in the 1930s and '40s. That didn’t strike me as irrational. It struck me as learned behavior. For years now, kids have watched adults, especially authority figures, respond to political events with certainty, panic and the most extreme historical language available. I’ve seen it up close. Last year, the day after Donald Trump was elected, one of my daughter’s track coaches confronted me at the school, where I was an assistant coach on the team. She was waiting for me, visibly angry. In front of more than a dozen members of the team, and without provocation, she loudly lectured me about how the country was now in grave danger, how the LGBTQ community was immediately unsafe, how abortion rights would be stripped, how everything had changed overnight. She was unhinged and unprofessional, and I was embarrassed for her. She made assumptions about my politics without ever having asked, and she delivered those assumptions publicly, as fact, to a group of kids who were watching how adults handle disagreement and uncertainty. That moment stayed with me, because it revealed something important: kids don’t just absorb information; they absorb tone. They learn which emotions are rewarded, which words carry moral authority, and which comparisons are treated as acceptable shorthand. So, when my daughter echoed the language she’d been hearing — when she reached for the most extreme historical analogy she knew — I didn’t hear recklessness. I heard the downstream effect of years of modeled hysteria. Here’s the problem: the ICE \"bait\" story wasn’t true. Had it been, I would have been enraged, too. None of this requires pretending immigration enforcement is easy, clean or painless. It isn’t. Families get separated. Children get scared. Even when the law is being enforced properly, the human cost is real, and it deserves to be acknowledged honestly. That’s exactly why the facts matter so much. When false stories spread, they don’t just mislead the public; they deepen fear among immigrant communities and make an already difficult reality even harder to navigate. According to DHS officials, what actually happened was far less sinister than what was being spun online. During an enforcement action, the father, in this country illegally, fled, leaving his young son behind. One officer stayed with the child to ensure his safety while another pursued the father. This was not a kidnapping. That detail didn’t go viral. The accusation did. This is how misinformation works now. You don’t need to fabricate an entire story. You just remove enough context, add a charged word or two, and let the algorithm do the rest. And suddenly, a teenager is wondering aloud whether she’s watching the early stages of Nazism play out on her phone. That should alarm us, not because of the teenager, but because of the adults. Words matter. History matters. When elected officials casually accuse law enforcement of kidnapping without evidence, they aren’t just scoring political points. They’re teaching a generation that facts are optional if the narrative feels righteous enough. When educators and authority figures normalize Nazi comparisons as everyday rhetoric, they flatten history into a political prop. Nazism wasn’t harsh rhetoric or unpopular policy. It was a totalitarian system that stripped people of rights, humanity and, eventually, life itself. Millions were murdered. There were no free elections. No free press. No lawful way to object without disappearing. Treating that history as a reusable insult doesn’t make us more vigilant; it makes us careless. My daughter deserves better than that. So do your children. Her instinct to care is a strength. The people who exploit that instinct for clicks, clout or political advantage are the ones who should be answering hard questions. If we’re serious about protecting kids, maybe we should start by telling them the truth.","summary":"When politicians call law enforcement “kidnappers,&quot; kids listen.

Are they supposed to let a five-year-old child freeze to death?” he said.\n\nThe UN human rights chief Volker Turk called on US authorities to end the “dehumanizing portrayal and harmful treatment of migrants and refugees.”\n\nDemocratic congressman Joaquin Castro, whose Texas constituency includes a San Antonio ICE detention center to which it was thought Ramos was taken, said he was seeking updates on his welfare and whereabouts.\n\n– ‘Dealing with children’ –\n\nBorder Patrol senior official Gregory Bovino defended his officers’ treatment of Ramos, telling reporters Friday: “I will say unequivocally that we are experts in dealing with children.”\n\nICE commander Marcos Charles said Friday “my officers did everything they could to reunite him with his family” and alleged that Ramos’s family refused to open the door to him after his father left him and ran from officers.\n\nRamos and his father were at a “family residential center pending their immigration proceedings,” he added after alleging they entered the United States illegally and were “deportable.”\n\nCharles claimed that “agitators” with shields had gathered outside the federal facility where he was speaking, a flashpoint for anti-ICE protests. \n\nThe Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office said dispersal orders were issued for an “unlawful protest.”\n\nRamos’s teacher, whose name was given as Ella, called him “a bright young student.”\n\n“All I want is for him to be back here and safe,” she said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nIn Minneapolis, where temperatures touched -23C (-9F) on Friday, protesters wrapped in hats, gloves and scarves chanted “ICE out” after anti-Trump group Indivisible Twin Cities called for a day of “No work. No school. No shopping” as part of a broader anti-ICE protest action.\n\nSeparately, protesters picketed outside Minneapolis St. Paul airport over the facility’s use for deporting those swept up in immigration raids, with local media citing organizers as saying some 100 clergy were arrested.\n\n– ‘Just a baby’ –\n\nFormer US vice president Kamala Harris said she was “outraged” by Ramos’s detention and called him “just a baby.”\n\nRamos is one of at least four children detained in the same Minneapolis school district this month, local administrators said.\n\nMinneapolis has been rocked by increasingly tense protests since federal agents shot and killed US citizen Renee Good on January 7.\n\nAn autopsy concluded that killing was a homicide, a classification that does not automatically mean a crime was committed.\n\nThe officer who fired the shots that killed Good, Jonathan Ross, has neither been suspended nor charged.\n\nMarc Prokosch, the lawyer for Ramos and his father, said they followed the law in applying for asylum in Minneapolis, which is a sanctuary city where police do not cooperate with federal immigration.\n\nChildren have long been caught up in federal immigration enforcement, under both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\nMinnesota has sought a temporary restraining order for the ICE operation in the state which, if granted by a federal judge, would pause the sweeps. There will be a hearing on the application Monday.","summary":"Thousands join a Minneapolis protest after the ICE detention of a 5-year-old boy sparks outrage.

The 41-year-old's first big splash, new CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil, has been met with ridicule and, even worse, low ratings.\n\nThe new anchor got off to a rough start on Monday, January 5, after suffering an on-air meltdown during a confusing night-one broadcast. Tuesday saw a strong negative reaction to what many deemed a \"fluff piece\" on Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nThe unplanned mistakes, along with the \"Bari backlash,\" led to the new guy doing worse than his predecessors. \n\nRatings for Dokoupil's Monday debut were significantly down across major advertising demographics. According to Nielsen data obtained by Radar, viewership was down 22 percent compared with the same day last year.\n\nOne insider blasted the newscasts and the mistakes.\n\n\"Talk about amateur hour – CBS couldn’t even get through a 30-minute show without massive errors,\" the source shared. \"And this guy is delusional enough to throw shade at Walter Cronkite?\"Trump Goes on a TearIt likely didn't help when Dokoupil found himself getting a media tongue-lashing from Donald Trump, who said the anchor owed him his job.\n\nDokoupil reported from Detroit last week and joined the president for a tour of a Ford plant. While speaking with Trump, the new anchor asked about the economy and mentioned the continuously rising gas prices.\n\nThat set the president off, who replied with his familiar talking points, only this time, tailored to Dokoupil and his own job security.\n\n\"We have now the hottest country in the world. And a year and a half ago our country was dead. We had a dead country,\" he told Dokoupil, before bringing up his prediction if Kamala Harris had won the 2024 election. \"You wouldn't have a job right now. If she got in, you probably wouldn't have a job right now. Your boss, who's an amazing guy, might be bust, okay?\"\n\nHis boss, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, is a friend of Trump's, who had promised to bring more conservative reporting to the network.Dokoupil's Big PaydayTrump continued: \"Let me just tell you, you wouldn't have this job. You wouldn't have this job, certainly, whatever the h-- they're paying you. Our country is rocketing right now. We have the hottest country in the world. If they got in, we would be Venezuela on steroids.\"\n\nDokoupil, evidently rattled by the president's charge, came back to his comments at the very end of their discussion, telling Trump: \"For the record, I do think I'd have this job even if the other guys won.\"\n\nWithout hesitation, Trump fired back: \"Yeah, but at a lesser salary.

After all, CBS got to do it for just 16 million,\" Colbert said on his show. \"Check my math. Check my math on that one.\"\n\nThe joke likely refers to Paramount's $16 million settlement in July in a lawsuit filed by Trump, who alleged the network deceptively edited an interview that aired on its \"60 Minutes\" news program featuring then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nColbert's dig toward CBS comes as \"The Late Show\" is set to air its final episode in May. Paramount canceled the late-night talk show last May, calling it \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.\"\n\nColbert says new FCC guidance is trying to 'silence' late-night TV\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission issued a Jan. 21 public notice with new guidance stating that daytime and late-night television talk shows do not have a blanket exemption under the Communications Act of 1934.\n\nThe law required FCC licensees, both in radio and later in television, to offer equal broadcast opportunities to political candidates and was amended in 1959 to exempt newscasts, news interviews, news documentaries and on-the-spot coverage of news events.\n\nColbert said the new guidance was an attempt to silence him, Seth Meyers and Jimmy Kimmel, whose show ABC temporarily pulled off the air after FCC Chair Brendan Carr made comments interpreted by some as a threat to pull the ABC station licenses if Kimmel wasn't fired over remarks about Charlie Kirk's assassination.\n\n\"Hey, I'm flattered you think that appearing on my show has the power to affect politics in any way, OK? I've been doing this job for 21 years, and let me tell you something, buddy. If our government had turned out the way I had chosen, you would not have the power to make this announcement,\" Colbert quipped.\n\nFollowing the FCC's public notice, Carr said on X Jan. 21 that the new guidance reminds talk shows to remember their obligation to \"provide all candidates with equal opportunities.\"\n\n\"For years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late night & daytime talk shows qualify as 'bona fide news' programs - even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes,\" he wrote.","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2026/01/23/stephen-colbert-cbs-trump-fcc/88323105007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/23/USAT/88323333007-20251114-t-105517-z-1254556023-rc-22-whalqibb-rtrmadp-3-awardsgqmotyla.JPG?auto=webp&crop=4528,2547,x0,y252&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-23 22:22:58","author":"Usa Today","authors":["Usa Today"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.173},{"id":395505698,"title":"Vance crushes false narrative about ICE 'arresting' 5-year-old boy","text":"An image was circulated widely this week showing a visibly upset preschooler wearing an oversized hat and Spider-man backpack standing in the company of federal immigration agents. Evidently loath to investigate the circumstances surrounding the photo and what it actually depicts, Democrats and other radicals rushed to condemn U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D), for instance, suggested ICE had treated the boy like a criminal, while twice-failed presidential candidate Kamala Harris wrote that he \"is just a baby. He should be at home with his family, not used as bait by ICE and held in a Texas detention center. I am outraged, and you should be too.\"\n\n'No one thinks that makes any sense.'\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D) went a step further, accusing ICE of \"kidnapping 5-year-olds and using them as bait\" and suggesting the agency should be defunded.\n\nThe liberal media didn't appear particularly eager to correct Democrats' false narrative, which was incubated by woke officials with Columbia Heights Public Schools, where the child was reportedly enrolled.\n\nDuring his visit to Minneapolis on Thursday, Vice President JD Vance gave the press a reality check, noting that anti-ICE propagandists glossed over some critical information about the incident.\n\n\"I actually saw this terrible story while I was coming to Minneapolis,\" said the vice president. \n\n\"And I see this story, and I'm a father of a 5-year-old — actually, a 5-year-old little boy. And I think to myself, 'Oh my God, this is terrible. How do we arrest a 5-year-old?'\"\n\n\"Well I do a little bit more follow-up research, and what I find is that the 5-year-old was not arrested; that his dad was an illegal alien; and when they went to arrest his illegal alien father, the father ran,\" said Vance.\n\nRELATED: 'Going to get someone killed': Democratic AG shocks with talk about shooting ICE agents in 'stand your ground' Arizona \n\n Photo by Jim Watson - Pool/Getty Images\n\nVance told the Minneapolis crowd, \"So the story is that ICE detained a 5-year-old. Well what are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a 5-year-old child freeze to death? Are they not supposed to arrest an illegal alien in the United States of America?\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security indicated that when ICE attempted to arrest the boy's father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, in the Minneapolis suburb of Columbia Heights on Jan. 20, the illegal alien from Ecuador \"fled on foot — abandoning his child.\"\n\nMarcos Charles, the assistant director of enforcement and removal operations for ICE, indicated on Friday that after the illegal alien ditched his little boy and was arrested, ICE officers \"stayed with the child. They cared for him, took him to get something to eat from a drive-thru restaurant, and spent hours ensuring he was taken care of. Again my officers did that. Not his father.\"\n\nCharles noted further that people inside the illegal alien's apparent residence refused to open the door for the young boy and take him back.\n\nAccording to DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, the boy's alleged mother was inside the house and would not let him in even after officers assured her that she wouldn't be taken into custody.\n\nMarc Prokosch, a lawyer representing the family, indicated during a press conference on Thursday that the boy and his father were reunited and are being kept together at the Dilley Immigration Processing Center, a family holding center in Dilley, Texas.\n\n \"Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children, or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates. This is consistent with past administration’s immigration enforcement,\" said DHS.\n\nThe vice president further suggested that the argument that ICE cannot arrest illegal aliens who have children is unworkable given that'd mean \"every single parent is going to be completely given immunity from ever being the subject of law enforcement.\"\n\n\"That doesn't make any sense.

Josh Shapiro if he had \"ever been an agent of the Israeli government\" during its vice presidential vetting process. In an op-ed Friday for The Washington Post, Kirchick wrote that the Harris campaign's implication that Shapiro harbors dual loyalty to the United States and Israel \"marks yet another sad chapter in the Democratic Party’s ongoing betrayal of American Jews.\" \"The most charitable explanation for this implication of dual loyalty, one of the oldest of antisemitic defamations, is incompetence,\" he wrote. \"Since Shapiro’s emergence as a national political figure, many progressives have alleged that he ‘served’ in the Israel Defense Forces.\" OBAMA WINGMAN ERIC HOLDER DEFENDED WALZ'S VETTING, THEN MINNESOTA’S FRAUD SCANDAL ERUPTED According to Kirchick, the claim that Shapiro served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) \"butchers the truth,\" saying the governor merely took part in a high school volunteer program that involved working on a kibbutz and assisting at an Israeli military base. \"Perhaps Dana Remus, a former official for the Obama and Biden administrations who challenged Shapiro’s American bona fides, and her boss, former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr., just had bad information,\" Kirchick wrote. \"Assuming that Remus and Holder are both familiar with Google, however, it’s fair to suspect that the real reason the Harris campaign was concerned about Shapiro was that he’s a vocally pro-Israel Jew.\" Kirchick argued that even if Shapiro had served in the IDF, \"the left’s fixation on him represents a glaring double standard,\" adding that \"what sets off progressives isn’t the principle of serving in a foreign army, but serving in the army of the Jewish state.\" Later in the op-ed, Kirchick argued that if \"progressives were more self-aware,\" they would take time to think \"before suggesting that Jewish Americans with connections to Israel, a key democratic U.S. ally, are somehow disloyal.\" \"After all, there is also a long, dishonorable tradition of progressives explicitly rooting for America’s enemies abroad,\" he added, claiming progressives \"wanted the Vietcong to win\" against the U.S. during the Vietnam War, among other examples. WALZ’S LONG-RUNNING FRAUD SCANDAL PUTS HARRIS CAMPAIGN JUDGMENT UNDER SCRUTINY In closing, the author asserted the \"appropriateness of Americans joining foreign military forces,\" such as Israel, \"boils down to one's worldview.\" He wrote that those who view Israel as an ally see Americans who served in the IDF as part of the \"same admirable continuum\" as those who defended the Spanish Republic and against Nazism. Conversely, Kirchick added, those \"such as Holder and Remus\" view a \"connection to Israel that many Americans share constitutes a potential counterintelligence threat.\" \"By casting aspersions on one of the Democratic Party’s most loyal and generous constituencies, progressives have shown what side they’re on,\" he concluded. Harris' press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. JOSH SHAPIRO DEFENDS CLAIM THAT KAMALA HARRIS TRYING TO ‘COVER HER A--’ WITH CRITICAL BOOK EXCERPT In a preview for Shapiro's upcoming book, \"Where We Keep the Light,\" published Sunday, The Atlantic reported a section devoted to what he described as \"unnecessarily contentious\" questions from Harris' team, particularly former Biden aide Remus. One question he said he received during the vetting process included: \"Have you ever been an agent of the Israeli government?\" \"Had I been a double agent for Israel? Was she kidding? I told her how offensive the question was,\" Shapiro wrote. \"Remus was just doing her job. I get it. But the fact that she asked, or was told to ask that question by someone else, said a lot about some of the people around the VP.\" Shapiro described further probing about his views on political topics, such as whether he'd be willing to \"apologize for some of his comments about protesters at the University of Pennsylvania who had built encampments to decry Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and, in some cases, intimidated Jewish students.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Shapiro added that he ultimately declined the running mate offer after Remus suggested the position \"might be a financial burden for him and his wife.\" Fox News Digital's Linsay Kornick contributed to this report.","summary":"Author James Kirchick criticized Kamala Harris&apos; campaign team for allegedly asking Pennsylvania Gov.

He's here this week with his billionaire sugar daddy, Alex Soros, and Davos is a perfect place for a man who, when everyone else is on lockdown, when he was having people arrested for going to church,\" Bessent said. \"Shame on him. He is too smug, too self-absorbed, and too economically illiterate to know anything.\"\n\nBut Bessent wasn’t done with Newsom. During a Friday interview at Davos, Bessent responded to Newsom's bizarre comparison of President Trump to a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and it was savage.\n\nRecommended: Here’s the Infuriating Reason Don Lemon Avoided Charges in the Church Mob Incident\n\n“I think Gavin Newsom may be cracking up with some of these things he's saying. I think he may be in over his hairdo, and, you know, being on the national stage is very different than being governor of California, you know, with no signature achievements,” he said. “But to say strange things like, ‘President Trump is a Tyrannosaurus Rex,’ what the hell does that mean?

But that was brutal. Bessent was alluding to the fact that he’s selling $100 kneepads on his website featuring Trump’s signature.\n\nIt’s obvious to anyone that Newsom is using Davos to audition for a 2028 presidential run, trying to present himself as Trump's opposite to a room full of European elites. The problem? It's backfiring spectacularly. Instead of elevating his standing, Newsom's performances are exposing his weaknesses. Even Stephen A. Smith blasted Newsom for his behavior at Davos.\n\n“Gavin Newsom, respectfully, what are you doing?” Smith asked on his podcast earlier this week. “You’re the governor of the state of California in the United States of America. Why are you over in Davos, Switzerland, talking to folks and speaking negatively about the president of the United States?”\n\nHe added, “I have no problem with Gavin Newsom being candid and open about his feelings about our president on United States soil.”\n\nNewsom is all hair gel and no substance. He can slick back his hair and smile for the cameras, and yet, he can’t even come out looking good after a tiff with Bessent.\n\nWant to support fearless journalism that exposes the Left and tells the stories the media won’t?

Trump gave little detail on what the board plans to do but said, “it would work with the United Nations to ensure peace in the Middle East and hinted at wider ambitions,” CBS News reported.\n\n Joining the charter reportedly requires a lofty $1 billion membership fee, though it remains unclear what the money will be used for, according to multiple outlets.\n\n Few Western nations have expressed interest in joining the new group, which is mostly made up of countries in the Middle East, Asia and South America.\n\n Nations who have accepted Trump's invite, according to CNN, include Albania, Argentina, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Mongolia, Morocco, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.\n\n The executive board has been filled out with appointed members: U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, billionaire businessman Marc Rowan, World Bank Group president Ajay Banga and U.S. deputy national security adviser Robert Gabriel.\n\n The board will be indefinitely chaired by Trump.\n\n On Thursday, Jan 22, during his monologue on The Late Show, Colbert, 61, called Trump’s billion-dollar entry fee for the Board of Peace “a little steep,” then taking a jab at his own employer by saying that CBS agreed to “obey” the president for far less.\n\n “Why, you may ask, is this even happening? Good question, me,” Colbert prefaced his roast. “Especially because the Board of Peace’s mission would overlap with the United Nations’ aim of maintaining international peace and security. So, Trump is literally just doing model UN.”\n\n “Now, admittedly, the idea of paying a billion dollars to obey Donald Trump seems a little steep,\" the comedian added. \"After all, CBS got to do it for just 16 million.”\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n Colbert has previously been critical of CBS' decision to settle a lawsuit with Trump for $16 million, which will be donated to his future presidential library.\n\n Three days before CBS made the shocking announcement that The Late Show would be canceled after its current season, Colbert criticized the network’s parent company for agreeing to settle a lawsuit with Trump.
