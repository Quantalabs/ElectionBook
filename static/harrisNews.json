The left is the party of grievance politics and “yes you can’t” messaging.\n\nNow, data collected from the 2022 Cooperative Election Study from Tufts University and reported by statistician and political commentator Nate Silver reveals that, among voters who said their mental health was poor, 45% identified as politically liberal and just 19% were conservatives.\n\nConversely, those who said they had excellent mental health identified as conservative 51% of the time, while 20% were liberal.\n\nThe stark lifestyle differences between the two are illuminating.\n\nFor one thing, Democrats have ceded a virtual monopoly on pro-family and pro-religious messaging to Republicans — the very values that can promote life meaning, interpersonal connection and mental well-being.\n\nConservatives traditionally promote family values, and it’s long been known that people who have other people who rely on them, like spouses and children, fare better than people who only worry about themselves.\n\nTake, for example, Fay Dubinsky, a 28-year-old Zoomer who actually describes herself as a happy member of the most depressed generation on record. \n\n“I take time for myself, but so much of my day is to help others, to take care of my family, to take care of my baby,” Dubinsky, a mother of a two-year-old, told The Post. “People my age, their life is about them, and serving themselves, and always seeking out more pleasure.”\n\nSome 86% of conservatives identify with a religion, according to Pew. And religious people are more likely to self-describe as “very happy” in the United States, likely because they have a connection to a higher purpose beyond the earthly world.\n\nThis likewise applies to Dubinsky: “I grew up Jewish and religious, and I think that’s probably one of the reasons that I’m not depressed or anxious. I have so much meaning in my life, and that’s not typical for my generation.”\n\nBut it’s also about the messaging coming from conservative politicians about self-reliance and self-confidence, two traits highly associated with mental well-being, according to mental health professionals and organizations alike.\n\nThe right traditionally espouses pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps messaging — teaching people they can rely on their hard work and resolve to get by.\n\nOn the flip side, Democrats have embraced just about the opposite of all of these values. Self-reliance?The libs aren’t fans.\n\nIdentity politics have overtaken the Democratic party, as lefty leaders insist that immutable characteristics like race and gender are constantly holding citizens back from their potential. \n\nOnly government intervention — and a vote for their side — can fix it, they claim. It’s the sort of ideology that saw the Biden administration attempt to give out loans exclusively to black farmers. What sort of message does that send?\n\nOr how about the endless insistence that non-white voters would be disenfranchised if voter ID laws were put in place, because they couldn’t possibly be expected to produce identification like everyone else?\n\nDemocrats have also become the party of handouts and free things — from student loan forgiveness to endless stimulus checks — implying that Americans can’t get along without their help in a world stacked against them.\n\n“Today the game is rigged — rigged to work for those who have money and power,” Elizabeth Warren declared in her memoir “A Fighting Chance.” It’s an ironic title, considering how the Massachusetts senator is pretty much implying regular Americans don’t have one.\n\n“I was born in a place where your Zip code determines your destiny,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, a graduate of Boston University and nationally famous politician, told her constituents who are from that same area.\n\nAnd sometimes it’s not even clear who exactly is holding people back … but it’s definitely someone.\n\n“There will be a resistance to your ambition, there will be people who say to you, ‘You are out of your lane.'” Kamala Harris bafflingly said in 2020. “They are burdened by only having the capacity to see what has always been instead of what can be. But don’t you let that burden you.”\n\nThere’s a term in psychology called the “locus of control,” which refers to your sense of whether things happen to you or whether you make things happen. \n\nNo surprise that the latter — a greater sense of agency — is associated with vastly better mental health. When you stop thinking everything is working against you and start taking power over what you can control, the world becomes a far less scary place.\n\nUnfortunately, the left has taught its voters to externalize their locus of control, according to Greg Lukianoff, co-author of “The Coddling of the American Mind.”\n\n“Progressivism, with its emphasis on victimhood and vulnerability to impersonal forces … weakens the sense of agency and, frankly, contributes to depression and anxiety,” he told The Post. “As the political left reevaluates its strategies on everything from abundance to identity, it should also consider adopting an ideology that empowers individuals, fosters an internal sense of control and doesn’t fuel emotional suffering.”\n\nIt’s no wonder, then, that the party of self-pity is also the party of poor mental health.","summary":"Is it any wonder liberals are having a mental health crisis&quest;","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/03/us-news/is-it-any-wonder-liberals-are-having-a-mental-health-crisis/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/mental-health_720.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=720","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/qg8i9921-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-03 22:10:54","author":"Rikki Schlott","authors":["Rikki Schlott"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.166},{"id":327813200,"title":"“THIS IS ABSURD”: Michele Tafoya Weighs in on Transgender Girls Track Champion","text":"Former longtime NFL sideline reporter Michele Tafoya, now host of The Michele Tafoya Podcast, joined The Guy Benson Show today to push back on the idea that the rarity of trans athletes in women’s sports justifies their inclusion, and that calling it unfair, uncompetitive, and saying that the participation is harmful to women does not make you bigoted.

She campaigned heavily against him last year.\n\n'If Trump wins, we lose,' Doyle wrote on Instagram a few weeks before the November election, adding 'out daughters will have fewer rights than our mothers.' She used the post to blast Donald Trump's record on women's rights and abortion rights.\n\nAnd, in August, Doyle shared a photo on Instagram at the Democratic National Convention voicing support for Kamala Harris.\n\nDoyle's memoir 'Untamed' recounts how she 'learned that a responsible mother is not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows them how to fully live.'\n\nIn the book, the host of the 'We can do hard things' podcast also discusses her coming out as a lesbian.

'The fight - that was never me.'\n\n'Oh my gosh, I don't think I saw sunlight for four years,' she said of being an adviser to the president.\n\nBut she said the main reason she's not returning to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is her children Arabella, Joseph And Theodore.\n\n'The main reason I am not going back to serve now is, I know the cost. And it's a price that I'm not willing to make my kids bear,' she said.\n\n'My primary goals were just to like, be the best freaking mom,' she said.

Borders Closed. Trump’s Second Term Is Just Getting Started.","text":"Editor’s note: This is a lightly edited transcript of today’s video from Daily Signal Senior Contributor Victor Davis Hanson. Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see more of his videos.\n\nHello, this is Victor Davis Hanson for The Daily Signal. We’re at four months now in the new Trump second administration. And a strange thing has happened. \n\nIf you look at the polls, after diving for President Donald Trump with the announcement that he was going to subject certain countries to high tariffs—which panicked the stock market. Now, the stock market’s almost recovered, or has recovered, all of its lost. It went down a little bit when Trump said he was going to continue the tariffs, to force the European Union to have reciprocal treatment toward the United States. \n\nBut nevertheless, Trump in the RealClearPolitics averages—which to be fair, have a preponderance of left-wing polls—is still only about a point, point and a half down. But in other polls, Rasmussen, he’s either even or he is a couple of points ahead. And yet, all of the media and all of the major organs on the Left, but even in the center and Right—The Wall Street Journal, to take another example we’ve discussed—they have been uniformly negative.\n\nSo, how in the world is Donald Trump—and Donald Trump has not been reticent. He has tweeted all sorts of things about, you know, Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift and Canada—things that were very controversial. How can he be almost equal and much higher than he was at his first term at this time? And the answer is twofold.\n\nNo. 1 is what he’s doing. Every time people say we’re headed for a recession or his trade war is gonna tank the economy, data comes out. This week, it was the corporate profits were unusually high, strong. It came out that we’re not in a housing recession, that housing sales are steady. Inflation is down. Energy prices are way down. Economic growth is up. Joblessness is down. So, that is one reason. \n\nThe second is Donald Trump has been touring the world. And you can call it mercantilism but essentially, the Trump doctrine is we’re not going to get into optional military engagements on the ground anywhere and we’re going to have our relations be transactional. So, even our enemies—to the degree it’s even possible—we’re gonna try to find some mechanism by which we can stop wars. Maybe rare earth mineral corridor in Ukraine or maybe we’re dangling an end of sanctions for Iran—I don’t think that’s going to work.\n\nBut the point is people appreciate the idea that Trump, first, is trying to exhaust peaceful avenues before he uses force. And he’s trying to address the theater wars that former President Joe Biden left him in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nThe economy is strong. The border is 99% closed. We’ve gone from over 150,000 entries down to less than 8,000, in many places fewer. The wall is going to be continued. The Border Patrol is increased. The deportations, despite the court orders, continue.\n\nSo, the things that he’s doing are very popular, especially to the working classes: black, white, Hispanic. They like cheap gas prices. They like news that there’s going to be $8 to $10 trillion of investment and new jobs and assembly manufacturing in the United States. They like the idea that we’re cutting unnecessary funds for government and we’re not touching Social Security. They like the idea that Trump is trying to reduce taxes on the middle class in terms of Social Security or tips. But there’s another facet. And that is not Trump, but the people who despise Trump and are attacking Trump.\n\nWhen the electorate looks at that and they say, “Well, Trump—I like everything he’s doing but I don’t like what he said about Canada. It just kind of bothers me.” Or, “I don’t like him lowering himself to attacking Bruce Springsteen, in kind.” Yes. But what is the alternative? \n\nWell, the alternative is the Left is glorifying a murderer, Luigi Mangione. And the campuses will not, cannot, do not want to stop the antisemitism. So, we see foreign guests with masks on who continue to use violence and vandalize our campuses. Now we have two wonderful Israeli citizens who have been murdered. And doesn’t seem that anybody in the core base of the Democratic Party is objecting at all.\n\nThis comes on the heels of attacks on Tesla. This comes on the heels of this strange Democratic reaction to Trump, where they use almost pornographic language: “s—,” the F-word. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz can’t give a speech without either comparing Trump to Hitler or calling him some pejorative.\n\nThe result of all this is when they look to the Democratic alternative, there is no alternative. There’s no explanation why they opened the border. There’s no explanation, opposition to what Trump is doing. Why aren’t they saying, “We like an open border. Stop it, Donald Trump”? They’re not even doing that.\n\nThey’re not presenting any positive, constructive alternative. There is no shadow government. There is nobody in the Democratic Party that is popular. Not Tim Walz. Not former Vice President Kamala Harris. Not Sen. Chuck Schumer. Not even Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Especially not Rep. Jasmine Crockett. I mean popular to the American people in general.\n\nAnd so, when you add the fact that the economic news is pretty good and there’s a lot of initiatives on the horizon—peace initiatives, foreign investment initiatives, trade initiatives. And when you look at the people around Trump—Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent—they’re very good. And when they go before Congress, they’re calm, they’re rational, they’re data-driven. The Democratic senators who press them and inquire of them and mock them are usually poorly prepared, hysterical, angry, and make fools of themselves.\n\nAdd it all up: Things are going pretty good in the country. Donald Trump is a whirlwind. He’s staging a counterrevolution. And most of the issues that he’s trying to undo of the progressive project, the public supports him. \n\nAnd his Democratic opposition—four months into his tenure—has still completely lost its mind and not only does not offer an alternative agenda, but personally, emotionally, psychologically puts people off. They do not like the way that they’re talking. They do not like the way they’re acting. And they don’t like them in general.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

That can be in the form of lone wolf ideologues, terrorist cells, or well-coordinated actors from hostile foreign governments and organizations.\n\nThe Trump administration has been correct to pin a large portion of the blame for the Boulder attack on Biden.\n\n“The Biden Admin granted the alien a visa and then, when he illegally overstayed, they gave him a work permit,” Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, wrote on X Sunday.\n\n“Immigration security is national security,” Miller wrote. “No more hostile migration. Keep them out and send them back.”\n\nThat’s right. As more details emerge about Soliman, a picture is emerging of a man who should never have been allowed in the country and flagrantly abused our immigration system once he was here.\n\n“Soliman came to the U.S. on a tourist visa in August 2022, according to a source from the Department of Homeland Security,” News Nation reported. “One month later, he applied for asylum. Soliman, his wife and their five children have been living in Colorado Springs, Colorado, since.”\n\nSoliman was reportedly granted a work permit in 2023, but it expired in March. Soliman’s wife and five children were taken into ICE custody Tuesday. \n\nSome have called this threat overblown, but that notion should be gone after Sunday. How many more people like Soliman, radicalized by the Israel-Gaza conflict, are still living in the U.S., potentially plotting other acts of violence?\n\nThere are certainly signs that other people willing to commit similar acts of terrorism have come into the country over the last four years.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee released a report in August indicating the Biden administration released 99 potential terrorists into the country since January 2021.\n\n“Under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, of the more than 250 illegal aliens on the terrorist watchlist who were encountered by Border Patrol at the southwest border between fiscal years 2021 and 2023, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released nearly 100 of them, with at least 34 others in DHS custody but not yet removed from the United States,” the committee said in a press release.\n\nIllegal aliens came from a total of 36 countries, the report says, with an “active” terrorist presence, “including Afghanistan, Egypt, Iraq, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Mauritania, Pakistan, Russia, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Yemen.”\n\nNotice that Soliman’s home country of Egypt is on that list.\n\nHow many more potential, foreign-born terrorists are lurking in America?\n\nIn 2024, the Department of Homeland Security, “identified over 400 immigrants from Central Asia and elsewhere who crossed into the U.S. in the past three years as ‘subjects of concern’ because they were brought by an ISIS-affiliated human smuggling network,” NBC reported last June.\n\nEight Tajikistan nationals with suspected ties to the Islamic State were arrested that month, but as the Immigration and Customs Enforcement director told The Daily Signal’s Virginia Allen at the time, this didn’t solve the problem. Not only were there likely many people in the U.S. connected to terrorist groups, but the vetting process made it difficult to ensure that the people brought in “legally” weren’t a danger to Americans.\n\n“Thousands of terrorists in the world are not found in any database,” Homan told The Daily Signal last June. “That is why we need to end catch and release and reestablish the ‘Remain in Mexico’ [policy].”\n\nLooks like Homan was onto something.\n\nEven former FBI Director Christopher Wray admitted in 2023 that the border crisis was opening the U.S. to the potential for an escalation of terrorism. He said of terrorists at a Senate hearing:\n\nObviously, their ability to exploit any port of entry, including our southwest border, is a source of concern. There is a lot of discussion about numbers, and numbers are important. But let’s not forget that it didn’t take a big number of people on 9/11 to kill 3,000 people. While numbers are important, numbers don’t tell the whole story. And we have seen an increase in KST, known or suspected terrorists, attempting to cross over the last five years.\n\nGiven the potential for deadly attacks on American citizens it seems like security should have been heightened, that visa vetting should have been aggressive.\n\nThe Trump administration is turning things around on that end and clearly prioritizing American security. But after four years of open borders nonsense and courts that want to continue those policies as long as possible, this problem can’t be solved overnight. \n\nThe far Left wants to “globalize the intifada.” Some of those who wish to do violence are home grown. But Biden’s border policies gave them a massive opening to magnify the threat on American soil. Shameful. It’s a good reminder the problem with Biden was about much more than just his poor health and mental condition.","summary":"President Joe Biden’s lax immigration enforcement and open borders policies made this country highly vulnerable to&#160;acts of terrorism.

Last year, she attended a Taylor Swift concert in Miami despite the pop star's endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.What to KnowOver the weekend, Ivanka shared photos of family and friends on Instagram, as well as one of the book Untamed by Glennon Doyle. The author has previously spoken out against the Trump administration.Untamed is Doyle's memoir, described on Amazon as a story about how she \"learned that a responsible mother is not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows them how to fully live. It is the story of navigating divorce, forming a new blended family, and discovering that the brokenness or wholeness of a family depends not on its structure but on each member's ability to bring her full self to the table.\"In August, Doyle shared a photo on Instagram at the Democratic National Convention voicing support for Harris.\"Because in 76 days, when the votes are being counted, we will watch knowing we did everything, everything in our power to keep our children, your children, all children protected from Donald Trump and JD Vance having any power at all over their planet, their families, their bodies, their futures,\" Doyle wrote.The author wrote in an October post that if \"Trump wins, we lose.\"\"There are 19 Days until Election Day: The day that will determine whether we will – or will not – have the right to make decisions about our bodies and our lives. And whether future generations will have fundamental freedoms,\" she wrote.Ivanka Trump has generally avoided discussing politics after her father left the White House in January 2021.

In doing so, they are continuing to take inspiration from anti-immigration movements abroad and attempting to introduce their talking points into Irish politics. \n\nOn 17 May, members of the far-right National Party attended a “Remigration Summit” in Italy, and at an anti-immigration rally in Dublin city centre on 26 April, they marched down O’Connell Street chanting: “Save the nation, remigration!”\n\nThe National Party’s only elected representative, Patrick Quinlan of Fingal County Council, repeated the call in a speech he made at the Customs House on the same day. \n\n“Ireland belongs to the Irish people. We must start a policy of mass remigration,” Quinlan told a crowd of thousands gathered along the quays who chanted: “Get them out! Get them out!” \n\n“We’ll shut the borders, we’ll house the people, we’ll rekindle our ancestors’ divine fire,” Quinlan said. \n\nThe party’s youth wing also turned up selling the same message – the mass expulsion of immigrants and those who do not fit their definition of Irishness. \n\nQuinlan is not the only Irish politician to call for ‘remigration’. Dublin City Councillor Gavin Pepper did so last year on social media, while complaining about crimes committed by Muslims in Ireland.\n\nGavin Pepper and Patrick Quinlan were contacted by The Journal and offered an opportunity to respond. \n\nAnd at the summit in Italy, National Party member John McLoughlin said that while his party does not advocate violence, when “our people reach breaking point, you most certainly won’t be able to depend on the likes of me or any other political leaders here to hold them back”. \n\nOpponents of ‘remigration’, he said, should think twice because “it’s not our last hope to save ourselves, it’s their last hope”. \n\nThe Journal sought to contact John McLoughlin via social media and the National Party, but received no response by the time of publication.\n\nThose on the far-right fringe in Ireland are following the lead of more established anti-immigration parties (and right-wing extremist groups) elsewhere in Europe, who have made mainstreaming ‘remigration’ their goal. \n\nIn the last year or so, they’ve begun to see some success.\n\nIt's great to have young men stepping up, Fair play John and well done on representing the party. https://t.co/FZ9sCxmSoy— Cllr. Patrick Quinlan (@PQuinlanNP) May 25, 2025 \n\nWhat does ‘remigration’ mean? \n\nThose who call for ‘remigration’ want to see non-white people expelled from Europe en masse, regardless of their citizenship, legal status or place of birth.\n\nThis, according to those who support the idea, can be done forcibly or through incentivising people to leave a country voluntarily. \n\nThe term ‘remigration’ has long been used in academia to describe people returning to their countries of origin voluntarily, like refugees returning to their home countries after World War II, for example. \n\nMore recently, the word has been hijacked by supporters of Identitarianism - a pan-European, ethnonationalist movement that began in France in the 2000s. \n\nRemigration is the only ticket to make Europe European again!\n\n👉🏻 Get yours now (in the comments below) and join us in that fight on Saturday the 17th of May in Milano, 🇮🇹\n\nLet’s make history together ✈️ ! pic.twitter.com/WKQv1ff93k— Remigration Summit 26 (@resum25) March 24, 2025 \n\nIdentitarians are racial segregationists. They oppose multiculturalism, globalisation and immigration in general, all of which they see as existential threats to the white populations and national cultures of Europe.\n\nLike other far-right groups, they are particularly concerned with demonising Muslims and often try to stoke fears of “Islamisation”.\n\nIn a 2019 report, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue – a think tank focused on combatting extremist ideologies – described ‘remigration’ as “essentially a non-violent form of ethnic cleansing”. \n\nA general election poster erected by a grouping of far-right parties, including the National PartyTelegram - The irish People\n\nTelegram - The irish People\n\nIf ‘remigration’ is the goal of white nationalists, the animating fear behind it is the ‘Great Replacement’ conspiracy theory, which casts foreigners – especially Arabs – as an invading force marshalled by global elites whose objective is to wipe out white people.\n\nThe ‘Great Replacement’ theory featured on general election posters erected last year by a grouping of far-right Irish parties that included the National Party, the Irish People party and Ireland First.\n\nIt also came up in the speech delivered by the Nationals Party’s John McLoughlin in Italy, when he talked about “ethnic replacement”, casting out “the invader” and referred to asylum seeker accommodation buildings as “plantation centres”.\n\nHe compared British control of the six counties in the north to how “Germany lost Frankfurt to Turkey, or France lost Paris to Algeria”. \n\nAs is typical with proponents of the theory, which originated in France, McLoughlin inverted the real history of the French invading and colonising Algeria. \n\nHe also said those who oppose ‘remigration’ aim to deny its supporters “the very heritage of our ancestors, carved in stone and soil”.\n\nDuring the speech, McLoughlin made repeated references to soil, and the phrase “stone and soil” has echoes of the Nazi slogan “blood and soil”.\n\nHe also said the National Party stands for “excellence over equality”. \n\nNational Party members represented Ireland today at the Remigration Summit 2025 in Milan.\n\nMany thanks to the conference organisers for hosting such a thoroughly well-run event despite interference from multiple state governments and their leftist foot soldiers.\n\nRemigration is… pic.twitter.com/5z8TaQyZti— The National Party | An Páirtí Náisiúnta (@NationalPartyIE) May 17, 2025 \n\nAs Quinlan and McLoughlin did in their speeches, Irish adherents to the theory cast their project as one of liberation, and resistance to the “invasion” and “plantation” of Ireland. \n\nThey do so using language that invokes the Irish struggle against British rule and colonialism.\n\nQuinlan said in his speech that Ireland has lost “that holy fire that blazed in our patriot dead”. \n\nAdvertisement\n\n“They were able to conquer tyranny because of that fire,” he said. \n\nElsewhere in Europe, white nationalists call for a new ‘Reconquista’, a reference to the campaign by Christian kingdoms to retake land conquered by Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula centuries ago. \n\nAnti-immigration protesters gather at the Customs House in Dublin.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nWho has called for ‘remigration’? \n\n‘Remigration’ has been promoted by far-right political parties and extremist groups in a number of European countries over the last ten years or so. \n\nMore recently, it’s found expression in Canada, Australia and, most notably, in the United States. \n\nThose who promote the idea aim to bring it into mainstream political discourse, which was the purpose of the “Remigration Summit” that took place in Italy on 17 May. \n\nIn 2024 the vision of Remigration became the hope of our entire continent.\nIn 2025 we will organize the first Remigration Summit: in May we will gather activists, journalists and politicians to unite our ideas, reach and influence. If we work together, Remigration is inevitable. pic.twitter.com/F0ZA0oWIXG— Remigration Summit 26 (@resum25) January 1, 2025 \n\nThe most prominent exponent of the idea in the European context has been the far-right German political party Alternative for Germany (AfD), which came second in this year’s federal election with just over 20% of the vote. \n\nThe AfD has been officially labelled a right-wing extremist group by Germany’s domestic intelligence agency (BfV) and one of its members has been convicted for using banned Nazi-era slogans. The party also has documented ties with neo-Nazi groups. \n\nThe BfV said the AfD aims “to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society, subject them to unconstitutional discrimination, and thus assign them a legally devalued status”.\n\nAhead of this year’s election, AfD leader Alice Weidel endorsed the idea of ‘remigration’ at a party conference, where she talked about “large-scale repatriations”.\n\n“And I have to be honest with you, if it’s going to be called remigration, then that’s what it’s going to be: remigration,” she said, making a U-turn on a topic that had brought intense scrutiny upon her party only a year previous. \n\nAfD leader Alice Weidel gives a speech at a party conference in Riesa, Germany.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nIn 2024, the policy was deemed too extreme by another major player in far-right European politics, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally party in France, after a report by Correctiv exposed a secret meeting between AfD members, neo-Nazis and like-minded businesspeople, at which ‘remigration’ was the main talking point. \n\nReports of the meeting led to massive demonstrations across Germany.\n\nNational Rally, which itself has Nazi-sympathising roots, and the AfD have since broken off their alliance in the EU Parliament.\n\nAnother far-right French politician, Éric Zemmour, has called for a ministry of ‘remigration’ to be established. \n\nIn Austria, the idea has been promoted by the leader of the Freedom Party (FPO), Herbert Kickl. The party laid out plans to create “Fortress Austria” ahead of parliamentary elections in 2024, in which it won around 29% of the vote. \n\nThe FPO has also called for the EU to have a “remigration commissioner”. \n\nFPO leader Herbert Kickl at a party meeting in Vosendorf, Austria.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nIn Sweden, ‘remigration’ is government policy, although it does not involve forcing people to leave the country. Sweden does not strip people of their citizenship or refugee status, unlike the more extreme ideas promoted elsewhere in Europe.\n\nThe Swedish government incentivises people to leave voluntarily by offering them money, something Denmark also does. \n\nAnd then there is the case of the United States since Donald Trump won the presidency for a second time.\n\nThere, the term has become more common since the 2024 election campaign, when Trump himself used it in a Truth Social post attacking his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris. \n\nTrump wrote: “As President I will immediately end the migrant invasion of America. We will stop all migrant flights, end all illegal entries, terminate the Kamala phone app for smuggling illegals (CBP One App), revoke deportation immunity, suspend refugee resettlement, and return Kamala’s illegal migrants to their home countries (also known as remigration).”\n\nUS President Donald Trump’s Truth Social post about immigration Source: Truth Social\n\nWhile Trump did effectively freeze all refugee resettlement on his first day in office, he also signed an executive order intended to provide white South Africans asylum status. \n\nHe has also said white people in South Africa are being subjected to “genocide”, a common myth among white nationalists.\n\nSince coming to power, the Trump administration has been expelling people from the US under dubious pretexts, some of whom have a right to reside in the country and others who are in fact American citizens. The US president’s use of the term ‘remigration’ was celebrated by those in Europe who have sought to mainstream it, including the well-known Austrian white nationalist Martin Sellner, who hailed it as a “victory”. \n\n“Remigration has had a massive conceptual career,” Sellner wrote on X.\n\n“Born in France, popularised in German-speaking countries, and now a buzzword from Sweden to the USA!”\n\nLast week, the US State Department sent a plan to congress that would transform the government agency that oversees immigration into an “Office of Remigration”.\n\nImplementing ‘remigration’ as envisioned by extremists like Martin Sellner would involve a state either revoking or breaking its own laws around citizenship. It would also mean withdrawing from international treaties that guarantee people the right to seek asylum. \n\nThis is why Germany’s AfD has been labeled a right-wing extremist organisation, because its intention is to violate the country’s constitution and deny citizens their most fundamental rights. \n\nNeed more clarity and context on how migration is being discussed in Ireland?

And of those, seven are out on leave, whether due to injury, administrative reasons or military duty. With seven retirements expected by the end of 2026, Dawley said the department is constantly trying to catch up.\n\n“We're a busy department, and we have a lot of officers that have some serious, major investigations … which take a lot of time, a lot of resources,” Dawley said. “But there's a lot of additional duties, onboarding new officers, internal investigations, clerical work, community meetings … and we just don't have enough people to do all these.”\n\nDawley said hiring remains one of the department’s biggest challenges, as fewer people are applying — and even fewer are making it through the process.\n\n“Our applicant pool is very, very low,” Dawley said. “People are either not signing up to take the test [or] they're not qualified. They're bypassed for whatever reason, their backgrounds.”\n\nTo help fill the gap, the department is looking beyond the traditional hiring process.\n\nA state law that went into effect in November 2024 gives municipalities another way to bring on entry-level officers by creating local hiring lists — separate from the statewide civil service exam. Under this system, candidates who haven’t taken or passed the traditional exam can still be hired if they meet basic eligibility criteria, such as prior military or law enforcement experience, a degree in criminal justice or a related field or prior service as a reserve or temporary officer. All recruits must still complete full police academy training before becoming active-duty officers.\n\n“The alternative pathways is hopefully going to be able to open up a whole new world for us, so to speak, where we can start taking different applicants, preferably lateral transfers,\" Dawley said.\n\nIn the past, high turnover made the department’s staffing challenges even worse — but that trend has started to shift, thanks in part to recent pay increases.\n\n“We were getting officers and they were leaving because [they were] finding other jobs that [paid] more [with] more benefits,” Dawley said. “Now we're very competitive, and I make a joke that with this alternative pathways, we're going to be pillaging from other departments, because they're going to want to come to Pittsfield … so that will help retain officers.”\n\nIn the proposed budget, captains will get a three percent raise, bringing their average salary to $155,625, while lieutenants will be receiving a 7.6 percent boost for an average of $157,028.\n\nSergeants would see a 4.9 percent raise, bringing their average salary to $147,633, while patrol officers would receive a more modest 1.9 percent bump, raising their average pay to $81,580.\n\n“We should try to be paying a good salary, because in the long run, we're paying overtime,” Councilor Earl Persip III said. “If we can get [salaries] up to where we need to be, that [overtime] number won't be so big. That's where we end up actually saving money and not wearing out our officers.”\n\nDawley said the department has also implemented educational incentives and several different stipends on top of the city’s growth opportunities to try to retain more officers.\n\nThe Fire Department’s $11.17 million budget and the $33,400 Emergency Management budget were also advanced without debate during the meeting.","summary":"A long-time staffing shortage in the Pittsfield Police Department has pushed overtime spending to record highs, prompting city leaders to pursue alternative hiring methods and approve pay raises in an effort to recruit and retain officers.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/news/central_berkshires/pittsfield-police-budget-overtime-costs/article_ff90ed3c-f772-49c6-8e1d-5a545c6d6b4c.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/ae/fae813fb-41f3-4154-bc39-7bba66c00c16/683f41c649c93.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-03 19:00:00","author":"By Maryjane Williams,Stephanie Zollshan — The Berkshire Eagle,The Berkshire Eagle","authors":["By Maryjane Williams","Stephanie Zollshan — The Berkshire Eagle","The Berkshire Eagle"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.119},{"id":327789728,"title":"Polling Conundrums: Activist Government, Sí; Democrats, No!","text":"There’s good news for liberal economics today, as well as bad news for Democratic Party economics, and all-around confusion about the public’s take on economics. The good news comes from some polling analysis released today by the Center for American Progress (CAP). The bad news, along with a smidgen of good, comes from a new poll conducted for CNN. The confusion comes when you try to reconcile the two, though I’ll take a stab at it at the end of this On TAP.\n\nThe CAP study looked at responses to questions about economic policy from voters both with and without college degrees—from both sides, that is, of the increasingly paramount gap in American politics—and found cross-class support for a number of liberal economic positions. (The surveys they studied included those of both pre- and immediately post-2024-election voters.) Fifty-eight percent of working-class voters and 61 percent of the college-educated believed the decline of unions had hurt American workers; 67 percent of working-class respondents and 58 percent of college grads supported a $17 federal minimum wage; 63 percent of the working class and 64 percent of graduates favored higher taxes on those making at least $400,000 a year; and roughly 75 percent of each group supported expanding Medicaid to cover more low-income Americans.\n\nBut this cross-class concurrence didn’t have much effect on the actual voting of these two classes. Fifty-six percent of college grads cast their votes for Kamala Harris, while 56 percent of the non-grads (who greatly outnumbered the grads) voted for Donald Trump. At minimum, this suggests that despite voters having ranked the economy as their number one concern, the economic policies listed above didn’t figure very much in their economic assessments (at least, when compared to the cost of living), or weren’t identified as policies that Democrats favored and Republicans opposed, or, very probably, both.\n\nThis weekend’s CNN-sponsored poll highlights the Democrats’ inability to brand themselves as the party with economic policies that benefit the working and middle classes. To be sure, the public is not in a libertarian mindset: Asked whether they believe that “the government is trying to do too many things” or that “government should do more to solve problems,” they opt for more problem solving by a hefty 58 percent to 41 percent margin. So, advantage Democrats? No.\n\nWhen asked which party better reflects their view on handling the economy, they prefer Republicans over Democrats by a 7 percent margin. That’s down from a 15-point Republican margin in 2022, when prices were soaring, so the Democrats’ disadvantage may still reflect public discontent with prices. Still, when you contrast Americans’ support for activist government with their discontent with the party that’s historically been the party of activist government, you’re almost compelled to reverse a venerable and fundamental rule of American public opinion: As propounded by Lloyd Free and Hadley Cantril in 1967, it asserts that Americans are philosophically conservative but operationally liberal. For the moment, that seems to have been flipped on its head.\n\nThis topsy-turvy moment comes with some caveats, however. First, since Trump took office again, there’s no question that Republicans in general and Trump in emphatic particular have been the activists, while Democrats have scrambled to find ways to respond and counter him. Asked which is the party that can get things done, 36 percent said the Republicans, while just 19 percent said the Democrats. The GOP, of course, has trifecta control of government, while the Democrats lack even a recognized leader—and their last leader, Joe Biden, wasn’t up to the task of promoting even widely popular policies like building new factories, roads, bridges, and broadband.\n\nIn a larger sense, though, Democrats have yet to make a compelling story of the economic shifts of the past half-century—the shift of income and wealth to the upper classes and the mega-rich in particular, at the expense of everybody else. Public support for discrete policies that stand little chance of enactment—labor law reform, higher minimum wages, paid family leave—won’t have much effect on voting habits unless there’s a plausible chance for their becoming law, and until they’re fitted within a credible and compelling story of the changes to American life. What stands out about the efforts of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, what makes their talks different from those of most Democrats, isn’t their “radicalism” but rather their ability to place the thousand unnatural shocks that Americans regularly experience within an explanatory narrative about the shift in wealth and power that’s dominated the past 50 years of American life.\n\nFor their part, Republicans do have a story, whose implausibility hasn’t meant it’s ineffective. It’s the immigrants’ fault, and that of welfare cheats (never mind that welfare, as such, has dwindled to a trickle). The particulars of a progressive populist story are there for the taking, with the added benefit that the culprits—Wall Streeters and other wielders and champions of financialized capitalism—are already widely and justifiably loathed. But building a progressive populist movement requires Democrats to talk about the role that finance and kindred institutions have played, which most Democrats are still reluctant to do. If they’re going to benefit from the public’s anti-libertarian, anti-oligarch turn, however, they’re going to have to Bernie-fy themselves. That doesn’t mean they have to support Medicare for All, but they do have to go after the corporatization of medicine, the pernicious role of private equity, the pricing practices of pharma, and the way those institutions’ money dominates politics—and then invite the public to draw its own conclusions. If Democrats are ever going to reclaim the advantage that once came to them as the champions of pro-working-class economics, they’re going to have to go big.","summary":"Today on TAP: Polls show support for liberal economic policies, as well as more support for Republicans than Democrats on matters economic.","url":"https://prospect.org/blogs-and-newsletters/tap/2025-06-03-polling-conundrums-activist-government-si-democrats-no/","image":"https://prospect.org/downloads/22975/download/Meyerson%20on%20Tap%20060325.jpg?cb=d518f26988e0a9f1c4496320d0df7860&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-03 19:00:00","author":"Harold Meyerson","authors":["Harold Meyerson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.279},{"id":327774734,"title":"Jack Ciattarelli ‘not one bit’ concerned Trump’s endorsement will hurt his electability","text":"“He got 500,000 more votes than Phil Murphy did in ‘21, that was last year’s election,” Ciattarelli argued on Fox News’s Fox & Friends First. “Right now, he’s pulling 7 points better than Phil Murphy in this supposedly deep-blue state.

Here’s why","text":"Yes, you read that correctly. \n\nAnd look, if Trump had a horrific start to his second term, or faced a Nixonian-level crisis, that would be one thing. But Trump 2.0 has been, by almost all practical measures, a profound success. The numbers back it up.\n\nInflation has fallen for three straight months and currently sits at 2.1%, 7 points lower than it was under then-President Joe Biden in 2022. Biden, without almost any scrutiny from the press or any questioning of his mental state at the time, claimed he inherited high inflation when he took office. \n\n“No president has had the run we’ve had in terms of creating jobs and bringing down inflation,” Biden said in a May 2024 CNN interview with Erin Burnett. “It was 9% when I came to office, 9%.”\n\nBurnett didn’t push back on that ludicrous claim. \n\nMore Trump 2.0 numbers:\n\n– Consumer confidence is at a four-year high \n\n– The S&P just had its best month since 1995 \n\n– Unemployment is at 4.2% \n\n– GDP is now forecast to grow by 4.6% in the second quarter (source: Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank) \n\n– Gas prices are down more than 50 cents per gallon compared to one year ago\n\n– Border crossings are down 95% compared to one year ago \n\nSo what exactly is warranting this 92% negative coverage? Two things: First, liberal bias is in the DNA in every newsroom and studio, and second, as Axios’s Alex Thompson awkwardly explained during what feels like a never-ending book tour with Jake Tapper, reporters are intimidated not by their readers but by others in the business who will not stand for any scrutiny of any Democrat, especially of the presidential variety. \n\n“I do think in some cases, some reporters let their ideological leanings, like, affect their reporting,” Thompson told Bari Weiss on his podcast. “But I do agree that, sort of, I think the groupthink that sets in among Washington, and the self-reinforcing, and the intimidation by the White House, and by feeling like you’re ostracized — not just by potential sources, and potentially losing access, but also by, like, your peers and colleagues who are like giving you side eye — I do think is like — I mean, listen, I mean, it made me doubt myself, right?”\n\nWe saw this intimidation take down then-CNN President Chris Licht in 2023 after he attempted to bring CNN out of Crazytown in its coverage of Trump to a more neutral place, prompting overwhelming blowback from within his own ranks. The final straw came when Licht had the audacity to invite Trump on for a town hall with Kaitlan Collins, which was totally justified considering Trump was well ahead of his competitors for the Republican nomination at the time. \n\n“This thing was madness, total madness,” said media “reporter” Bill Carter of the New York Times. “Like giving a microphone to Drunk Uncle and saying: go for it!” \n\n“This is CNN’s lowest moment as an organization,” the Atlantic’s James Fallows argued. \n\n“THIS is the 2024 Republican presidential primary,” CNN media critic Brian Stelter wrote. “Look away if you choose, but this is what it’s going to be like. Should news outlets sanitize it or stare it in the face?” \n\nStelter was part of a cabal inside CNN that was aghast over Trump being given a platform on the network. “Anchor” Anderson Cooper took it two steps further with this doozy of a monologue the next night that, in another era, would have had him fired during the commercial break. \n\n“I get it. It was disturbing,” Cooper said directly to viewers. “The man you were so disturbed to see last night, that man is the front-runner for the Republican nomination for president,” Cooper said. “You have every right to be outraged today, angry and never watch this network again, but do you think staying in your silo and only listening to people you agree with is going to make that person go away?”\n\nYep. He actually said that. No reprimand. \n\nLicht, however, would be fired less than a month later. \n\nMeanwhile, when comparing coverage of Trump’s first four months to coverage of Biden over his four years overall, the 46th president clocked in with 59% positive coverage versus 41% negative. That’s a 102-point swing upward for a president some regard as the worst of our lifetimes, given his record on inflation, crime, energy prices, spending, the border, education, and foreign policy. Yet the media found a way to provide positive coverage nearly 60% of the time. \n\nBut here’s the good news if karma means anything: Despite all the negative coverage Trump received throughout his third campaign for president, despite two assassinations attempts, and despite a lawfare effort resulting in 94 felony charges, he still won the popular vote and every swing state while Republicans took back the Senate and held the House. \n\nSo what does that tell us? \n\nLegacy media influence is a fraction of what it once was.\n\nWe saw this play out during the 2024 campaign in real time after then-Vice President Kamala Harris was installed as the Democratic nominee without one vote from the public. Trump’s strategy was to embrace new media through podcasts and attending MMA fights, which produced viral clips of Trump entering to roaring crowds and rubbing elbows with Dana White. \n\n“MMA fights. Joe Rogan. We think of them as very specific things, but the symbolism — It says something about him that she couldn’t capture,” explained Tony Fabrizio to Politico after the election. \n\n“Where she’s doing the big speech or having the big debate, the conventional warfare, traditional campaign tactics. Donald Trump goes to the McDonald’s drive-through. But in the year 2024, when we’re all living on our phones, a big speech at the Ellipse vs. Trump at the drive-through, which is going to break through?”\n\nIt’s a great point in retrospect: Which will live on in infamy? Trump in an apron, smiling and waving goodbye to customers in a McDonald’s drive-thru in photos and videos that were among the most viewed of any campaign? Or a speech by Harris at the Ellipse that no one can quote even one sentence from? \n\nNevertheless, outlets such as the Drudge Report, which has morphed into some kind of weird version of the Bulwark meets the Lincoln Project, mocked the strategy. \n\n“One fry short of a Happy Meal!” and “Felon Finds Work” were the headlines at the time. \n\n“Trump serves fries and falsehoods at McDonald’s,” was the Washington Post headline. \n\n“There is scant evidence of Mr. Trump cooking for himself,” a somber New York Times reported. \n\nMeanwhile, Harris’s speech at the Ellipse received glowing reviews, with Time magazine slobbering so much over it that the campaign’s PR team couldn’t dream it up better. \n\n“The iconic columns of the White House glowed behind her. In front of her, thousands of supporters held ‘USA’ signs and wore bracelets that lit up red and blue across the grassy acres of the Ellipse,” the magazine “reported.” \n\n“In a forceful, 30-minute speech, Harris asked voters to elect her and ‘turn the page’ on Trump,” it added. \n\nIn the end, it all didn’t matter. Trump won, and Harris lost. And the Democratic Party has been lost ever since. \n\nA CNN poll just released underscores the fact that despite legacy media still largely in the Democratic Party’s corner, just 16% of respondents say Democrats have strong leaders, and only 19% say they could get things done. \n\nThat’s horrific. \n\nFor the next 42 months of Trump’s presidency, expect more of the same from our hopelessly biased legacy media. They will show they learned nothing from the embarrassment of “missing” the Biden story (they missed nothing — they just wanted Trump defeated by any means necessary). \n\nRatings will continue to fall, as will readership. But most importantly, so will trust. And without that, old media’s impact will continue to lose out to new media, in which Democrats are way, way behind. The players there don’t seek to serve as their stenographers.","summary":"If you thought that the media would have a come-to-Jesus moment in light of the debacle that was their coverage of the Biden presidency, think again.  A recent study by the Media Research Center shows that President Donald Trump has received 8% positive coverage during his first four months in office, while 92% has been [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3429112/why-legacy-media-trump-coverage-negative/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/trump-world-leader-parade.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-03 18:00:00","author":"Joe Concha","authors":["Joe Concha"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.261},{"id":327752336,"title":"Trump insiders are tired of Laura Loomer’s sway - but admit her political influence keeps rising from the dead","text":"Those close to President Donald Trump have reportedly grown irritated with Laura Loomer, the ultra-loyal Trump supporter whose apparent influence has led to the ousting of several administration officials. \n\nLoomer, 32, has made a name for herself in Trumpworld as an unofficial, yet devoted, patron to the president – willing to publicly call out any person she believes has any ties to Trump criticisms. \n\nIn April, Loomer reportedly gave Trump a list of disloyal National Security Council staffers who were subsequently fired. In May, Loomer appeared to take some credit for pushing Trump to axe former National Security Adviser Mike Waltz after the Signal chat blunder. \n\n“Trump likes Laura, and she obviously has some influence, but she runs the risk of overestimating her influence and blowing herself up if she's not more careful,” an unnamed source close to the White House told WIRED.\n\n“I think she jumped the shark by going out and taking credit for stabbing the national security adviser and a number of people, as if it happened in a vacuum, as if there weren’t deep considerations and conversations about all of this,” the unnamed administration source said.\n\nWhile her loyalty to the president may be appreciated by Trump himself, Loomer’s history of making headline-grabbing, controversial comments and bolstering conspiracy theories, such as those related to 9/11, already made some of Trump’s official staff uneasy about her presence. That has led her to move in and out of his orbit over the years. Insiders painted a picture of thinking she is away for good only to have her return again. \n\nThose close to the president’s campaign reportedly attempted to keep Loomer, a far-right activist, at a distance the election, not giving her an official job. Despite that, Trump brought Loomer along for the ride when he debated former vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nEven after winning the election, Loomer’s presence in Trump’s orbit has not been diminished.\n\nShe’s managed to maintain communications with the president and some White House staffers, according to WIRED.\n\nLoomer is not an official member of the administration – though she’s asserted she was nearly hired on several occasions. She’s reportedly pitched her opposition research firm as a potential contract for the White House and expressed her desire to “work for President Trump.” While not having an official role, she’s still used her social media to highlight Trump’s agenda and “vet” members of the administration she believes are unworthy of their role. \n\n“You have to ask yourself: If Trump wanted her in, do you think his staff had some ability to prevent that, apparently?” an administration source told WIRED. “Like, what?”\n\nSuspicions about Loomer have grown recently as the conservative activist has dabbled more in criticizing some of Trump’s recent decisions, according to WIRED. \n\nIn May, Loomer ran an op-ed on her blog, called “Loomered,” critiquing Trump’s decision to remove oil company Chevron’s operations in Venezuela. \n\nShe also deviated from her typical praise of Trump to criticize his decision to accept a jet from Qatar. \n\n“It's one thing to attack random government employees who Trump doesn't give a s*** about, but when she's attacking him and his policies directly, that could end badly for her,” the unnamed White House source told WIRED. \n\nTrump insiders have questioned whether Loomer can remain in the president’s good graces while wadding into those waters. \n\nThen, just weeks after Walz was ousted and days after criticizing the Qatari jet gift, Loomer took to X to apologize to Trump for making comments that “made anyone feel betrayed.”\n\n“I am sorry if my comments made anyone feel betrayed or were used by the media as ammunition to sow division during an important trip for the President,” she continued. I want to apologize to President Trump more than anyone because I am a loyal person, I love President Trump, and I know I could have probably just had a private conversation about the plane instead,” Loomer wrote. \n\nThe Independent has reached out to Loomer for comment.","summary":"Last month, Loomer appeared to take some credit for Trump ousting former National Security Adviser Mike Waltz","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/laura-loomer-trump-insiders-influence-b2762826.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/12/15/newFile-11.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/N69d7VNr-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-03 17:12:06","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":327737244,"title":"Arnold Schwarzenegger Tells Environmentalists ‘Stop Whining and Get to Work’ During Trump’s Presidency","text":"Arnold Schwarzenegger shared some blunt advice Tuesday for environmentalists who are concerned about the Trump administration’s chainsaw approach to environmental sanctions and climate initiatives.\n\nSpeaking at the Austrian World Summit in Vienna, an annual, international climate conference he launched, the former Republican governor of California revealed that he is constantly asked by environmentalists and climate change experts what the point is of fighting for the environment at a time when the U.S. government “says climate change is a hoax and coal and oil is the future.”\n\nAccording to Schwarzenegger, he always tells those experts and activists, “Stop whining and get to work.” \n\nArguing that 70% of pollution can be reduced by local and state-level initiatives, he called for environmentalists to try making change in other, corporate and governmental ways.\n\n“Be the mayor that makes buses electric; be the CEO who ends fossil fuel dependence; be the school that puts (up) solar roofs,” the movie star, politician and bodybuilder said. “You can’t just sit around and make excuses because one guy in a very nice White House on Pennsylvania Avenue doesn’t agree with you.”\n\nWhile he was in office from 2003 to 2011, Schwarzenegger devoted a substantial portion of his efforts as a public official to creating and establishing climate initiatives in California. In the years since, he has continued to focus on ensuring a cleaner environmental future as both a spokesperson for environmentalists and through his Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative.\n\nSince Trump took office again in January, his administration has, conversely, been aggressive in rolling back environmental regulations implemented during Joe Biden’s presidency, withdrawn funding from climate projects, proposed major cuts to environmental agencies and pushed for an increased focus on stateside oil and gas production.\n\nDespite his history of environmentalism and his public endorsement of Kamala Harris in late 2024, though, Schwarzenegger chose not to directly criticize President Trump during his appearance at this year’s Austrian World Summit. He said that such a strategy is “not my style” and noted that he refuses to criticize any American president whenever he is outside of the United States.\n\nInstead of criticizing Trump, Schwarzenegger urged environmentalists to focus on enacting demonstrable, impactful change any way they can. “I know that the people are sick and tired of the whining and the complaining and the doom and gloom,” he explained. “The only way we win the people’s hearts and minds is by showing them action that makes their lives better.”","summary":"The former California governor weighed in on the issue at this year's Austrian World Summit\n\n\nThe post Arnold Schwarzenegger Tells Environmentalists &#8216;Stop Whining and Get to Work&#8217; During Trump&#8217;s Presidency appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/arnold-schwarzenegger-environmentalist-advice-under-trump/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Austrian-World-Summit-2025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-03 17:02:57","author":"Alex Welch","authors":["Alex Welch"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.061},{"id":327734200,"title":"CBS stalwart reveals 'the truth' about edited Kamala Harris interview that Trump is suing the network over","text":"Veteran CBS correspondent Lesley Stahl has lashed out in 'anger' at her corporate overloads potentially settling Donald Trump's $20 billion lawsuit, arguing edits of Kamala Harris' 'word salad' were done to save time rather than deceive its audience. \n\nSpeaking candidly on The New Yorker Radio Hour, Stahl, 83, addressed the controversy over an October 2024 60 Minutes segment featuring Kamala Harris, 60, which Trump alleges was edited to make the then-Vice President appear more coherent and electable.\n\nTrump, 78, sued CBS - the parent company of '60 minutes' - just days before the 2024 presidential election for $20 billion. \n\nHe and his lawyers claim that the show edited an interview with Harris in a way that hurt his 2024 campaign. \n\nHowever, according to Stahl, the editing choices stemmed not from political bias but from routine time constraints.\n\n'There was a very long answer,' Stahl explained. '\"60 Minutes\" ran one part of the answer in Bill [Whitaker]'s piece, and \"Face the Nation\" chose another part of the same answer to run on theirs. We are under time constraints, and this was done for time.\n\n'We edit to keep our pieces down to a certain length. And this is what Mr. Trump sued over,' the former Face the Nation anchor continued. \n\nStahl's comments directly dispute Trump's accusation that CBS engaged in deceptive editing to aid Harris's public image during a critical election period.\n\n'What he said was that you made clear what had actually been a word salad,' New Yorker journalist, David Remnick, who conducted Stahl's interview recounted, summarizing Trump's claim. \n\n'In other words, what he was accusing “60 Minutes” of doing was trying to make Kamala Harris look better,' Remnick added.\n\nBut, the seasoned journalist emphasized that both programs - 60 Minutes and Face the Nation - merely used different portions of the same answer to accommodate their differing formats.\n\n'That what we did. We just ran two different halves of the same answer,' she affirmed.\n\nAt the heart of the legal dispute is Trump's assertion that CBS's editorial decisions were politically motivated. However, Stahl views the lawsuit as little more than a pressure tactic.\n\n'What is really behind it, in a nutshell, is [an effort] to chill us,' she said. 'There aren't any damages. He accused us of editing Kamala Harris in a way to help her win the election. But he won the election.'\n\nDespite the lawsuit's seemingly flimsy legal foundation - Stahl flatly called it 'a frivolous lawsuit' - CBS is reportedly engaged in settlement negotiations.\n\nShari Redstone, chair of Paramount Global and a key decision-maker in the network's corporate hierarchy, is said to be open to compromise, according to the New Yorker.\n\nInstead of fighting the lawsuit, Redstone wants to settle to stay on good terms with the President while waiting for FCC approval of a major deal. \n\nOn Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Paramount offered Trump $15 million to settle, but his team rejected it, demanding at least $25 million and a formal apology. \n\nBut, Redstone's openness to settling has since raised eyebrows within the newsroom, even as Stahl downplays internal discord.\n\n'They’re in negotiations to settle this lawsuit. Shari Redstone seems willing to compromise. I have to think that the newsroom at “60 Minutes” must be in incredible turmoil,' Remnick probed. \n\n'Turmoil is too strong a word,' Stahl replied sternly. 'That suggests we almost couldn't function, but that's not true.'\n\nStill, the situation has stirred unease among some staffers, particularly with Bill Owens, the former executive producer of 60 Minutes, who has since left the outlet. \n\nStahl explained that her former 'hero' ditched the outlet after 37 years because 'he was being asked to either not run pieces or to change parts of the stories.'\n\nA CBS spokesperson told the New Yorker that no stories have been blocked by Paramount or CBS management. \n\nStahl has since expressed 'anger' at her corporate overlords.\n\n'To have a news organization come under corporate pressure - to have a news organization told by a corporation, \"Do this, do that\" with your story, \"change this, change that,\" \"don’t run that piece\" - I mean, it steps on the First Amendment, it steps on the freedom of the press. \n\n'It steps on what we stand for. It makes me question whether any corporation should own a news operation. It is very disconcerting. As I said, we have had pressure before, in earlier owners. And yet...'\n\n However, the CBS correspondent stood firm in her journalistic duty to the people, telling the New Yorker she hopes her higher-ups 'hold the freedom of the press up as a beacon.'\n\n'I’m just, frankly, and this is being a little Pollyannaish, hoping that [Larry’s son] David Ellison and the people he brings in to run his organization hold the freedom of the press up as a beacon, that they understand the importance of allowing us to be independent and do our jobs.'\n\n'That would be the best outcome,' she added.","summary":"A CBS correspondent addressed the controversy over an October 2024 60 Minutes segment featuring Kamala Harris, which Donald Trump alleges was edited to make the her appear more electable.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14776207/lesley-stahl-kamala-harris-edited-interview-trump-cbs-lawsuit.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/03/16/99001041-0-image-m-24_1748965723535.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-03 16:45:24","author":"Editor,Samantha Rutt","authors":["Editor","Samantha Rutt"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.462},{"id":327734418,"title":"Ex-DNC chair complains Democrats expected him to 'just rubber-stamp' plans during 2024 campaign","text":"Former Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Jaime Harrison lamented that he was \"taken for granted\" as a party leader and was seen as a \"rubber-stamp\" throughout the 2024 campaign, as Democrats continue to determine a way forward after their loss to President Donald Trump in November. \"I feel like, as chair, my voice was not always heard, that I was taken for granted.

He explained that the Democrats ran a bad campaign that didn’t connect with working-class people. Sanders said Donald Trump was beatable, but the Democrats failed to talk about the real problems people face, as per reports. He personally traveled around the U.S. to help Kamala win and begged the campaign to focus on working-class issues. He wanted the campaign to talk about raising the minimum wage, fixing the healthcare system, building more affordable housing, and stopping greedy landlords. But the Harris campaign ignored him and instead focused on rich friends and anti-Trump Republicans, as per BBC Radio 4. He pointed out that Kamala spent too much time with Liz Cheney, a Republican, which confused working-class voters. Sanders also said it was a big mistake to use Mark Cuban, a billionaire from Shark Tank , as a campaign supporter. He said this election should have been an easy win, but the campaign was misled by wealthy elites and bad consultants. He asked a very direct question to the Democratic Party: “Which side are you on?”, which means are you with the rich or with regular people?, according to a HuffPost report. In a separate interview, Sanders told The Washington Post that Democrats don’t do enough to actually help working-class families. He said the problem is not fighting Trump harder, but not offering a strong plan that actually helps normal Americans. He believes even some Trump supporters would vote Democrat if the party had a better agenda for working people, as per The Washington Post report. Even before the election, people were already worried that Democrats were depending too much on celebrities like Oprah, Beyoncé, Clooney, and J.Lo.

James Risch of Idaho.\n\n\"I don't want to be a part of their narrative,\" she told USA TODAY about why she didn't accept the pardon. \"And then, of course, it's a slap in the face to the Capitol police officers and to our rule of law.\"\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, Hemphill was among the thousands of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., to protest the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nShe pled guilty to one misdemeanor count of parading, demonstrating or picketing in the Capitol building and was sentenced to two months in jail, 36 months of probation and $500 restitution.\n\nOn Jan. 20, Trump pardoned more than 1,500 people charged in the Capitol attack.\n\nIn an April 2 letter to Sen.

She also voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nCan a presidential pardon be rejected? How Capitol rioter turned it down\n\nAccording to the Constitution, a pardon can be rejected by the person it is tendered to.\n\nAfter Trump issued pardons for the Jan. 6 defendants, Hemphill said she initially wrote a letter to the Office of the Pardon Attorney asking to not be included in the act.\n\nSen. Risch's office helped her file the correct paperwork, she said, and about a month later they received the formal letter acknowledging her \"non-acceptance\" of the pardon.\n\nJason Riddle, a New Hampshire man who served 90 days in jail for participation in the attack, said in January that he also rejected the pardon, according to New Hampshire Public Radio.

Cab drivers, deli cooks, and far-flung uncles have all wanted to chat about the 55-year-old rapper who’s now on trial for charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy, and transportation to engage in prostitution. There is, certainly, plenty to talk about: Federal prosecutors allege that the media mogul liked to throw baby-oil-slicked orgies—called “freak-offs”—where abuse and exploitation regularly occurred. (He pleaded not guilty; his lawyers say he never coerced anyone into anything.) But the conversations tend to be less about Sean “Diddy” Combs than about playing a guessing game: Who else was involved?\n\nSome of the people I’ve spoken with had theories about Justin Bieber, citing rumors suggesting that the singer—a teenage protégé of Diddy’s—had been preyed upon (“Justin is not among Sean Combs’ victims,” Bieber’s representative said in a statement last month). Others speculated that the Democratic Party, whose candidates Combs has campaigned for over the years, was in some way implicated in the case. Most of them agreed that Diddy was comparable to Jeffrey Epstein in that he was probably at the hub of a celebrity sex-crime ring.\n\nSince the trial began a few weeks ago, it’s become clear what these conversations were: distractions from the bleak, all-too-ordinary issues that this case is really about.\n\nThe wild nature of the conspiracist narratives surrounding Combs can’t be understated. In January, social-media users wondered if the fires that swept through glitzy L.A. neighborhoods were meant to destroy evidence pointing to the participation of other celebrities. On Amazon last year, sales spiked for a salacious memoir purportedly written by the rapper’s late girlfriend, Kimberly Porter, and published by a self-described investigative journalist using the pseudonym Jamal T. Millwood—the latter being the supposed alias that Tupac used after he, according to legend, faked his death. (Amazon pulled the book from its offerings after Porter’s family lambasted it as a forgery.) One viral fake news story, based on no evidence at all, said that Will Smith had sold one of his children into Combs’s servitude. On Truth Social last fall, Donald Trump himself shared a meme featuring a fabricated image of Kamala Harris and Diddy, with text reading, “Madam vice president, have you ever been involved with or engaged in one of Puff Daddies freak offs?”\n\nThe media also stoked the fervor. A former bodyguard of Combs’s gave an interview for a TMZ documentary saying that politicians, princes, and preachers were mixed up in the rapper’s debauchery. The conservative influencer Charlie Kirk devoted a portion of one webcast to wondering, “Maybe P. Diddy has footage of Barack Obama doing something he shouldn’t have been doing?” Piers Morgan hosted a singer, Jaguar Wright, who insinuated that Jay-Z and Beyoncé had committed crimes much like the ones Diddy is charged with. After those stars issued a vigorous denial and threatened to sue, Morgan apologized and edited any mention of them out of the interview online—and then, in February, retired General Michael Flynn presented Wright with a “Defender of Freedom Award” at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nA few actual facts underlay all of this QAnon-esque speculation. For more than a decade, Combs’s legendary White Parties attracted a medley of stars to the Hamptons, Los Angeles, and Saint-Tropez. Attendees often joked publicly about how rowdy the festivities could get. Over the past year or so, dozens of people—an array of musicians, workers, models, and others who have crossed paths with him since the 1990s—have sued Combs for a variety of offenses (all of which he denies), and some of those suits have alluded to alleged misdeeds by other celebrities. (One lawsuit naming Jay-Z was dropped after the star denied the claim; he has since countersued for defamation.)\n\nStill, the speed and sheer giddiness with which conspiracist thinking eclipsed the known details of Combs’s case confirmed a few bleak realities about the psyche of a country in which economic inequality and sexual abuse are both stubbornly endemic. A whole class of politicians, commentators, and media platforms exist to exploit the resentments that everyday people hold toward the rich and famous. Meanwhile, rates of sexual harassment and assault—reportedly experienced by 82 percent of women and 42 percent of men in the United States in their lifetime—remain as high as they were when the #MeToo movement erupted in 2017. Examining the real reasons for this is less fun—and, for many, less profitable—than imagining that Hollywood is a front for ritualistic sadism.\n\nThe trial itself, which began in Manhattan on May 12, has not yet revealed a network of super-famous evildoers. Although the testimony has surfaced vivid and bizarre details about the rarefied lives of celebrities, it’s also told an intimate, human, oddly familiar story about how power can warp relationships in all sorts of ways. I realized that in the random conversations I’d had leading up to the trial, I’d heard a lot about the imagined villains, and very little about the people they were said to have hurt.\n\nCombs’s downfall in the public eye began in November 2023, when an ex-girlfriend, the singer Cassie Ventura, filed a lawsuit alleging that he had raped and physically abused her. The suit was settled one day later out of court, but many of its details are resurfacing now. Although the federal trial against Combs is expected to last at least eight weeks and feature dozens of witnesses, Diddy and Ventura’s relationship has been central to the testimony. Prosecutors say Combs ran an organized criminal enterprise that served, in part, to assist in and cover up this one woman’s subjugation.\n\nVentura, now 38, was a 19-year-old aspiring R&B singer when she met Combs around 2005. He’d heard her first-ever single, “Me & U”; it would become a hit, but Diddy promised that he could guide her to a career of lasting success. He signed her to a 10-album deal with his label, Bad Boy Records, and released her debut album in 2006. It is still her only album to ever come out.\n\nTheir relationship soon evolved from professional to romantic. The singer said she’d initially rejected the rapper’s advances but that she’d felt pressured to do what he wanted because her career was largely in his hands. He also reportedly provided her with gifts, threatened her with punishment, and supplied her with drugs until she felt he controlled her life. She said that he then used that control liberally, dictating what she wore, whom she socialized with, which medications she took.\n\nHe also beat her. Hotel security-camera footage from 2016 published by CNN last year—and used as evidence in the trial—showed Combs chasing Ventura down a hallway, throwing her to the ground, kicking her, and pulling her by her sweatshirt. The video is a small and terrible glimpse into their relationship. Diddy is in a towel and clearly furious; Ventura, starkly alone, makes no effort to defend herself. “My behavior on that video is inexcusable,” Combs said in a filmed mea culpa last year; during the trial, his lawyers have acknowledged that he was violent toward her.\n\nOther witnesses in the trial have testified that the hotel assault was not an isolated incident. One former assistant, Capricorn Clark, reported seeing Combs repeatedly kick Ventura after learning that she’d been romantically involved with the rapper Kid Cudi. Another former assistant, George Kaplan, described a 2015 altercation between Combs and Ventura on Diddy’s private jet. He heard the sound of breaking glass in a private area, where he then saw Combs standing and holding a whiskey glass over Ventura, who was on her back. According to Kaplan, Ventura screamed, “Isn’t anybody seeing this?” No one on the plane intervened, Kaplan said.\n\nThe now-notorious freak-offs allegedly occurred against this backdrop of violence and intimidation. Ventura’s lawsuit said that toward the beginning of Combs and Ventura’s relationship, Combs hired a man to have sex with Ventura while Diddy watched. Encounters like that, involving sex workers and drugs, became regular occurrences that could last for days at a time. The freak-offs were, prosecutors say, “performances” for Combs’s pleasure. And they affected the performers; Ventura testified to having medical problems, mental-health issues, and drug addiction as a result of them.\n\nCombs’s defense argues that Ventura willingly participated in these events. His lawyers have cited text messages in which she appears to express enthusiasm: “I’m always ready to freak off,” she wrote to him in August 2009. Other texts suggest a more complicated picture—in 2017, Ventura wrote, “I love our FOs when we both want it.” She and prosecutors assert that whenever she tried to resist Combs’s commands, he would bring her to heel with physical violence and threats of blackmail and financial harm. Ventura’s lawsuit alleged that when she tried to break up with him for good in 2018, he raped her in her home (an accusation that Diddy’s defense has concertedly pushed back on during the trial).\n\nVentura is not the only alleged victim of Combs’s. His employees have shared particularly disturbing stories: Clark said that Combs kidnapped her twice; a former assistant identified as Mia testified last week that the rapper repeatedly sexually assaulted her. (Diddy’s lawyers dispute that the kidnappings ever happened and have questioned Mia’s credibility.) Prosecutors are pursuing racketeering charges on the theory that Combs didn’t act alone: For example, they say he may have had someone set Kid Cudi’s car on fire (the defense denies Combs’s involvement in that arson). In this way, Diddy’s case is also a story about what happens when it’s easier to take the check and not ask too many questions.\n\nBut fundamentally, the trial is another highly public test of the definition of consent. It recalls the prosecutions of Harvey Weinstein, the movie producer who allegedly dangled job prospects to women interested in the film industry in exchange for sex (one of his convictions was overturned last year and is being retried now). It also evokes R. Kelly, the musician who wooed aspiring singers with promises of career help and then violently kept them—and other women—in sexual servitude (behavior for which he is currently serving 31 years in prison).\n\nAnd the issues here transcend celebrity. When #MeToo erupted eight years ago, it forced many everyday Americans to reexamine experiences they’d had in their workplaces and homes. The movement has, by many indications, petered out or even curdled into backlash: Yesterday, one of Diddy’s lawyers asked Mia whether she was looking for a “Me Too money grab,” which suggests he thinks the very words Me Too might be tinged for some jury members. But to sit with the allegations against Combs—and the experiences of the alleged victims—is to again be confronted with the underlying reasons that movement happened. It’s to be confronted with the intolerable things that happen when men are given the power to pursue their desires however they want, and to extract whatever they want from their underlings.\n\nA lot of people would evidently prefer to turn away from that confrontation—and to focus on fantasy. Since I started paying attention to the case, my YouTube algorithm has become polluted by videos with AI-generated courtroom sketches of stars such as Will Smith and Jay-Z, paired with totally imaginary testimony about their involvement in Combs’s crimes. The videos are yet another sign that our society is losing any shared sense of reality. They do, however, have disclaimers stipulating that they are fiction, which raises the question: Why is this the story someone wants to hear?\n\nPerhaps because tales of demonic Hollywood cabals offer a simple, clear-cut narrative that doesn’t ask us to reflect on how domestic violence and sexual coercion really get perpetuated—and perhaps because that narrative benefits certain agendas. Last month, I tuned in to Asmongold, a popular Twitch streamer who interprets the daily news for a large audience of young, often aggrieved men. He had a glazed look in his eyes as TV news footage related to the trial played on his screen. Then he said, “I don’t care about this case at all—until Diddy starts naming names.”","summary":"The speculative guesswork distracts from the all-too-ordinary issues at the center of his case.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/06/diddy-trial-allegations-rumors/683015/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/MfidIuzu5u5P6b6R8kIPI3E3t1k=/0x43:2000x1085/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/06/diddy/original.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-03 14:48:32","author":"Spencer Kornhaber","authors":["Spencer Kornhaber"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.014},{"id":327827658,"title":"'Lilo & Stitch,' 'Minecraft' and the revenge of the PG family movie","text":"The PG rating has made a major comeback in Hollywood. It’s strange to remember now, but during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic — when studios were sending many of their family-friendly movies straight to streaming services — there were serious conversations in the movie business about whether youngsters and their parents would ever return to theaters in full force. Streaming was just too convenient and affordable, compared with a Saturday outing of two parents and 2 1/2 kids, the logic went. But in recent years, the family audience has proved to be a bulwark for the theatrical movie business. Disney’s live-action “Lilo & Stitch” topped the domestic box office again over the weekend with $63 million in ticket sales, for a total of $280 million so far. It beat the latest \"Mission: Impossible\" and the new \"Karate Kid: Legends,\" both rated PG-13. As of Sunday, \"Lilo & Stitch\" had crossed $610 million globally. Warner Bros. and Legendary’s “A Minecraft Movie,” also rated PG, has amassed $423 million in the U.S. and Canada, the best of the year so far. Adding international grosses, its global tally is $947 million. Nine PG-rated movies have been released in more than 2,000 locations this year, up from six during the same period in 2024, according to industry estimates. Those movies have accounted for 41% of ticketing revenue in the U.S. and Canada this year, compared with 21% a year ago. (The Pixar megahit \"Inside Out 2\" was released in mid-June of 2024.) Family films are a boon to studios and theaters at a time when other categories — such as comic book films and one-off dramas and comedies — have been less reliable than they were in the past. And there’s more to come, including Universal’s “How to Train Your Dragon” remake, Pixar’s “Elio” and DreamWorks Animation’s “The Bad Guys 2.” Importantly, many of these movies are coming one after the other, which is essential if the industry hopes to re-create the moviegoing habit for current and future generations, especially as social media, YouTube and video games claim more of young people’s attention. “One of the things that I think the industry has struggled with over the last number of years is just having a regular cadence of movies in the theater,” said Michael O’Leary, head of the trade group Cinema United (formerly the National Assn. of Theatre Owners). “If you're a young person, and there's a six-month gap between movies, there's a lot of things going on, and your attention wanes.” The focus on PG-rated content stands in contrast with a few years ago, when the PG-13 rating was widely seen as the way to include a broad, “four-quadrant” audience: men, women, old and young. A PG rating tagged a new release as more of a kids movie. PG-13, the label for Marvel and DC movies, had more of a cool factor for teens and young adults. O’Leary has a theory for why things have shifted, and it has to do with the media consumption habits of today’s very young, known as Generation Alpha, or those who came after Gen Z. Kids now are more than just digitally native. They’re aware of new movies and TV shows coming out, in part because of exposure to social media at an earlier age compared with past generations of children. Parents will naturally be more comfortable taking their 7- and 8-year-olds to something like “Minecraft,” because they’re less likely to be presented with objectionable content. The Motion Picture Assn.'s rating system, though sometimes fraught and misunderstood, is meant as a guide for parents. “Younger people are inundated with more and more content at an earlier age, and they've become, in some ways, more discriminating connoisseurs of what they want to see,” O’Leary said. Surely there are some parents who take their kids to the movies less often now after the pandemic with the proliferation of at-home entertainment options. But overall, family movies are leading the industry. If the pandemic proved anything, it’s that if you’re a parent, you really can’t spend all your time in the house. Gen Z — now anywhere from 13 to 28 years old — is clearly doing its part. According to a recent NRG survey, 37% of Gen Zers say they go to the movies more than six times a year, up from 29% who agreed with that statement in February 2023. Adults, too, might be interested in seeing more PG content in theaters, particularly in the American heartland. Angel Studios’ animated Jesus film “The King of Kings” performed well (though somewhat ironically, most of Angel’s live-action movies are PG-13). The post-pandemic recovery of the family audience hit a big milestone in 2023 with Illumination’s “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” which grossed more than $1.36 billion worldwide. That was followed by the success of 2024 sequels such as “Inside Out 2,” “Moana 2,” “Despicable Me 4” and “Mufasa: The Lion King,” which all benefited from multigenerational appeal. The blockbuster Broadway adaptation \"Wicked\" was also rated PG, which helped make it a family moviegoing event. Now, the category is again on a hot streak. Industry analyst David A. Gross declared in a recent edition of his FranchiseRe newsletter, “the production pipeline is full and any loss of audience to streaming during the pandemic is over.” What hasn’t come back as strongly? Most notably, superhero pictures — one of the pillars of moviegoing for the last couple decades. Before the pandemic, the industry averaged seven superhero movies a year, and those would drive billions of dollars in global revenue, Gross said. Lately, the genre has been significantly thinner and far less consistent. R-rated horror movies are thriving (look at \"Sinners\" and \"Final Destination Bloodlines\"), but other adult-oriented movies are hit and miss. Increasingly, when studios want to draw a mass audience, that means going younger. What's the magic number that will allow Paramount's $8-billion merger with Skydance to go through? The Wall Street Journal reported that Paramount was willing to part with $15 million to settle President Trump's lawsuit against the company over edits to its pre-election \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris. No surprise, that's apparently not enough. Trump's team wants more, the Journal reported. The president wants $25 million and an apology from CBS News, a source told the paper. Trump's critics, journalists and 1st Amendment experts say the lawsuit is basically a shakedown. Some anti-Trump lawmakers say a settlement by Paramount could amount to an illegal bribe. Paramount is awaiting merger approval from the FCC, which is tasked with reviewing the transfer of broadcast licenses. Sources have told my colleague Meg James that the FCC approval process has been bogged down. The company stresses that it sees the legal dispute and the FCC review as separate issues. No one believes Trump sees them that way. On Monday, Paramount said it would add three new board members. There's been an unreal amount of good TV on lately. I've been catching up on Nathan Fielder's \"The Rehearsal,\" and often can't believe what I'm seeing. Also, Marc Maron is ending his podcast after 16 years. I've linked to various episodes in this newsletter. Here's one I'm looking forward to catching up with.","summary":"It’s strange to remember now, but during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were serious conversations in the movie business about whether youngsters and their parents would ever return to theaters in full force.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/newsletter/2025-06-03/wide-shot-template","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f7925b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2700x1418+0+58/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7b%2Fcb%2F40d4ca714132bc94ef199d6982ea%2F250603-wideshot-liloa","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-03 14:00:00","author":"Ryan Faughnder","authors":["Ryan Faughnder"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.273},{"id":327692392,"title":"Joy Reid claims ‘horrified’ MSNBC bosses pressured her to stop social media posts before she was fired","text":"Joy Reid claimed MSNBC bosses were “horrified” by her presence on social media and repeatedly pressured her to stop tweeting before ultimately canceling her primetime show, “The ReidOut.”\n\nIn a wide-ranging conversation with Katie Couric released Monday on Reid’s new podcast, the former MSNBC host claimed that management at the left-leaning, Comcast-owned network discouraged her from engaging with audiences online, fearing it gave her too much autonomy.\n\n“Anytime I would tweet anything, I would get calls — I would get, ‘Please get off Twitter, we hate it,’” Reid said.\n\n“They just don’t like that it pulls their talent and their reporters out of their control because now you’re not running what you’re tweeting through Standards and Practices. It’s giving your personality directly to the audience, which they don’t like because it’s no longer managed and curated by them.”\n\nReid’s MSNBC program “The ReidOut” was canceled in February as part of a broader programming overhaul led by the network’s new president, Rebecca Kutler. Reid’s final broadcast aired on Feb. 24.\n\nThe cancellation occurred amid a network-wide restructuring that also affected other hosts, including Alex Wagner and Katie Phang.\n\nReid’s remarks come ahead of the June 9 launch of “The Joy Reid Show,” a new podcast and YouTube series.\n\nShe posted the interview with Couric to her website and YouTube channel, marking her most candid remarks yet about her February departure from MSNBC.\n\nThe network gave no public explanation when it canceled “The ReidOut,” sparking speculation that the decision was part of a broader post-election shakeup following Donald Trump’s return to the presidency.\n\nSeveral non-white anchors were let go around the same time. Former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann called it “an MSNBC purge so brutally racist it makes you think it was done by [Elon] Musk.”\n\nWhen Couric asked her directly what led to her dismissal, Reid said she’s still unsure.\n\n“I’ve been asked this so many times,” she said. “And people think that I’m just saying it to BS, but I’m being honest with you — I don’t know.”\n\nReid said she learned about the cancellation not long after exchanging emails with MSNBC’s public relations team celebrating the show’s NAACP Image Award win.\n\nReid insisted the cancellation wasn’t related to poor ratings.\n\n“It wasn’t ratings,” she said. “We had just had a ratings meeting a couple of weeks before that talking about the fact that our show … other than Rachel Maddow, we were down the least” in the wake of Trump’s win.\n\n“We were just told that we were doing … that we were holding on pretty well,” Reid added. “And then, you know, it’s not like the ratings have gotten better since I’ve been gone.”\n\nShe described the way the news was delivered as “scripted” and “just very perfunctory,” noting she received no specific reason for the show’s end.\n\n“I wasn’t told ‘The ratings were terrible,’ ‘It’s something you did,’ ‘You tweeted a terrible thing,’” she said, adding that she had already been “extra careful” online amid growing concerns inside the network about talent on social media.\n\nAlthough Reid said she doesn’t necessarily believe her outspoken criticism of Trump was the reason for her show’s cancellation, she acknowledged it may have played a role.\n\n“I’m a black woman doing the thing. You know what I mean?” she said.\n\n“I think that there’s a difference for Trump in hearing the kinds of criticisms, specifically, out of a black woman. It bothers him in a way it doesn’t bother him like anything else.”\n\n“There’s a fear of him,” Reid added. “We’re seeing it everywhere.”\n\nReid has faced multiple controversies over the years, beginning with the resurfacing of homophobic blog posts from her defunct site, “The Reid Report.”\n\nInitially claiming her blog was hacked, Reid later admitted there was no evidence to support that, though she maintained the posts didn’t reflect her views.\n\nShe also apologized for past tweets mocking Ann Coulter and Lindsey Graham with sexist and homophobic language.\n\nIn 2020, Reid was accused of Islamophobia after comparing Trump’s rhetoric to that of radical Islamic leaders, prompting backlash from Muslim-American groups.\n\nMore recently, during MSNBC’s 2024 election coverage, she called Florida a “fascist-type government” and criticized white women voters in North Carolina for not supporting Kamala Harris, blaming them for the state’s failure to protect abortion rights.\n\nReid also stirred controversy with her response to the assassination attempt on Trump, suggesting his own rhetoric may have helped incite political violence.\n\nCritics accused her of downplaying the seriousness of the attack and called for her show to be canceled.\n\nThe Post has sought comment from MSNBC.","summary":"“Anytime I would tweet anything, I would get calls -- I would get, ‘Please get off Twitter, we hate it,’” Reid said.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/03/media/joy-reid-claims-horrified-msnbc-bosses-told-her-to-stop-posting-on-social-media/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/grabs-recording-joy-ann-reid-105791566.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-03 13:58:47","author":"Ariel Zilber","authors":["Ariel Zilber"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.149},{"id":327657092,"title":"Inside the high society wedding of the year as Steve Jobs's daughter Eve is set to wed Team GB equestrian Harry Charles","text":"Inside the high society wedding of the year as Steve Jobs's daughter Eve is set to wed Team GB equestrian Harry Charles\n\nThe couple are to tie the knot in the 'society wedding of the year' \n\nREAD MORE: Daughter of Apple billionaire, 26, has dated a Netflix star, a singer and Kendall Jenner's BFF - but it's a Team GB equestrian who has stolen her heart\n\nPublished: 12:58 BST, 3 June 2025 | Updated: 14:24 BST, 3 June 2025\n\nHigh society is gearing up for the wedding of the summer as a billionaire heiress and a Team GB star prepare to walk down the aisle in a spectacular ceremony in the Cotswolds.\n\nEve Jobs, the 26-year-old daughter of late Apple founder Steve, will wed British gold medal-winning equestrian Harry Charles, 25 in the British countryside in August - a year after confirming their relationship.\n\nThe couple were first spotted in public together at last year's Olympic Games in Paris - where Harry bagged a gold medal in team jumping.

Was this the voice of presidential confidence, or was it the howl of a man watching the walls close in? When power is secure, it whispers. When it’s scared, it shouts. And Trump’s over-the-top denials say the quiet part out loud: he’s terrified.\n\nOn January 19, 1967, inside the cavernous walls of Studio One at EMI’s Abbey Road Studios, John Lennon and Paul McCartney sat side by side, piecing together what would become the final track of “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.” Lennon, hunched over his acoustic guitar, sang the haunting opening lines of “A Day in the Life,” while McCartney accompanied him on piano. \n\nWhen he reached the line “I’d love to turn you on,” the two young songwriters shared a knowing glance. They were fully aware that this phrase would raise eyebrows and likely provoke the BBC, who indeed banned the song for its perceived drug references. Yet, for the Beatles, this line was less about promoting drug use and more about signaling a cultural awakening — a call to consciousness that mirrored the societal shifts of the 1960s. This shift helped fuel a movement that forced the United States to abandon the war in Vietnam — unable to sustain a battle both abroad and at home, America gave in, leaving Vietnam to the Vietnamese.\n\nThis moment in the studio encapsulated the Beatles’ evolving role as not just musicians but as commentators on and catalysts for change. Their music was beginning to reflect a deeper engagement with the world around them, challenging norms and encouraging listeners to question not only their parents, but the status quo.\n\nThis spirit of defiance is also evident in George Harrison’s “Taxman,” a biting critique of the British government’s taxation policies. Frustrated by the exorbitant taxes levied on the band’s earnings, Harrison channeled his discontent into a song that pulled no punches in excoriating Great Britain under Harold Wilson, laying bare the inequities of the system. “Taxman” stands as an early example of the Beatles using their platform to address political issues, setting the stage for the more overtly socially conscious music that would follow.\n\nFast forward through the decades, and the echoes of that Abbey Road rebellion grew louder. From the psychedelic haze of the ‘60s to the hard-edged protest anthems of the ‘70s, ‘80s, and beyond, artists have kept their fingers on the pulse of unrest — using music not as a soothing balm but as a blaring siren.\n\nJimi Hendrix’s “Machine Gun” wasn’t just a song; it was a searing lament for Vietnam, a raw, electrified howl of anguish that warned of the blood-soaked cost of war. The Clash’s “Guns of Brixton” captured the clenched fists and breaking glass of racial tension and economic despair in Thatcher’s Britain, a warning shot fired not from a rifle, but from a Fender Precision Bass landing in a collective of record players and ricochetting in the heart of the streets, lighting torches of awareness held high by both kids and adults.\n\nBruce Springsteen, ever the chronicler of the American condition, has long carried that torch. His “Death to My Hometown” is a bitter reckoning with the economic devastation wrought by greed and indifference, while “The Ghost of Tom Joad” resurrects Steinbeck’s specter of the dispossessed, a haunting reminder that the struggle for dignity and justice is far from over.\n\nThese songs don’t just warn—they witness. They record the heartbeat of rebellion, the collective refusal to let power go unchallenged. And they remind us that music, when wielded with purpose, can shake the foundations of the ‘system’.\n\nAnd that foundation wasn’t just shaken — Bruce rocked it. \n\nOn May 14, 2025, at Manchester’s Co-op Live Arena, Springsteen opened his “Land of Hope and Dreams” tour with a fiery denunciation of Donald Trump’s administration, labeling it “corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous.” He implored the audience to “raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring,” warning that America’s foundational values were under siege. He accused the administration of rolling back civil rights, stifling free speech, and aligning with dictators over democratic allies. These remarks were not offhanded—they were recorded and released days later as part of his live EP, “Land of Hope and Dreams,” which also featured a cover of Bob Dylan’s “Chimes of Freedom,” reinforcing his message of resistance.\n\nTrump’s response was swift and vitriolic. On Truth Social, he lashed out, calling Springsteen “a pushy, obnoxious JERK” and a “dried-out ‘prune’ of a rocker,” even mocking his appearance. He demanded that Springsteen “KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country,” and later suggested investigating him and other artists like Beyoncé and Oprah for their support of Kamala Harris’s 2024 campaign—alleging, without evidence, that they were illegally paid for endorsements.\n\nBut Springsteen wasn’t alone. Artists like Neil Young and Eddie Vedder rallied to his defense, denouncing Trump’s attacks and affirming the importance of free expression. The American Federation of Musicians also stood in solidarity, emphasizing that musicians have the right to speak out against injustice. \n\nIn the aftermath of 9/11, musicians came together at the Concert for the Heroes — their voices unified, rallying beneath the flag of freedom. They sang not just for America, but for the shared humanity that terrorism tried to shatter. I often wonder: if Jimi Hendrix were alive, what would he have made of it all? His blistering, feedback-laden “Star-Spangled Banner” at Woodstock wasn’t just a national anthem—it was a battle cry, a raw, unflinching “f-you” to anyone who threatened our American ideology.\n\nToday, we’re fighting a different kind terrorism — one that doesn’t come from distant shores, but rises from within. It erodes truth, fans the flames of hate, and chips away at the foundation of democracy itself.\n\nWho better to sound the alarm than Bruce Springsteen? His voice is the call to arms we need — a reminder that freedom isn’t just a flag we wave, but a fight we must wage.","summary":"Bruce Springsteen and Eddie Vedder's speeches against Trump echo musicians throughout history who spoke up when others were silent\n\n\nThe post Born to Rant: Springsteen&#8217;s Truth to Power Screed Is the Rallying Cry We Need | Guest Column appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/bruce-springsteen-trump-rallying-cry/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/bruce-springsteen.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&quality=89&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-03 13:10:00","author":"Richard Stellar","authors":["Richard Stellar"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.555},{"id":327670396,"title":"FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez Wages a Lonely Fight for Press Freedom in Trumpland","text":"Like any liberal on Fox News, Anna M. Gomez finds herself outnumbered. But that hasn’t stopped the Democratic appointee to the Federal Communications Commission from publicly speaking out about “sham investigations” and what she calls the weaponizing of the commission to serve the interests of President Trump.\n\nAppointed by President Biden in 2023, Gomez — who spent a dozen years as an FCC staffer in various capacities in addition to working as a private-practice telecommunications attorney — recently took her efforts to combat the FCC’s actions and support press freedom to Los Angeles. A May 28 event sponsored by the advocacy group Free Press marked the first stop outside of Washington in a “First Amendment Listening Tour” Gomez is conducting to call attention to the Trump administration’s hostility toward mainstream media.\n\nThat includes attempts to punish news outlets for unfavorable reporting about the president, investigations related to DEI policies and dangling the threat of stripping broadcast licenses from owned-and-operated TV stations, or at the least holding up of mergers that would involve transferring them.\n\nIf that sounds extreme, remember that Trump has stated — including during a speech at the Department of Justice in March — that negative coverage of him was “corrupt and illegal,” based on his unfounded assertion that media outlets like MSNBC and CNN were functioning as extensions of his political opponents.\n\nAfter the panel, Gomez struck a realistic note about what she can hope to accomplish as the soon-to-be lone Democrat on the five-member body, with Geoffrey Starks having announced that he’ll formally depart later this month.“I do work with my fellow commissioners and try to add value, and where I can agree, I will,” Gomez told TheWrap. “But if not, I’m going to speak out. So this is my role.”\n\nBased on the record thus far, Gomez will find little common ground with FCC chairman Brendan Carr, who has exhibited an apparent willingness to act as Trump’s personal advocate on issues such as the approval process regarding Paramount Global’s merger with Skydance Media. FCC scrutiny comes at a delicate time for the $8 billion deal, with Trump pursuing a lawsuit against Paramount’s CBS News and “60 Minutes” over a Kamala Harris interview during the 2024 election.\n\n“It is clear this administration is weaponizing the FCC, and the FCC’s licensing authority, and that’s what’s happening,” Gomez said.\n\nPractically speaking, that doesn’t leave Gomez with many options, in part because some of the initiatives Carr has pursued haven’t played out at the commission level, meaning there are no formal votes. Instead, she said, “It’s threats, letters and investigations at the staff level, and those aren’t appealable.”\n\nMedia companies are uncertain about how far the GOP-controlled FCC may take its rhetoric, with Carr referring to diversity efforts as “invidious” discrimination, and threatening to block merger activity by any company continuing to adhere to such policies. The FCC chairman has also spoken about whether those companies are operating in the public interest — a vague standard that could be used, in theory, to try and take away or block the right to own TV or radio stations.\n\nHowever murky those statements might be in practice, media companies that have already bowed to pressure — such as announcing that they were eliminating formal DEI efforts, or that have settled lawsuits brought by Trump — don’t appear eager to test the boundaries, given the high stakes involved and the potential damage to their businesses.\n\nRepresentatives for the FCC didn’t respond to a request for comment, though Carr has stated that his inquiries involving Paramount and CBS are unrelated to Trump’s “60 Minutes” lawsuit.\n\nTo many, however, that doesn’t pass the smell test, including Carr entertaining a complaint against CBS for “news distortion,” also using that term as leverage against MSNBC parent Comcast, a regular target of Trump’s social media wrath.\n\n“The threat is the point. No lawyer thinks there’s an actual claim against CBS for news distortion,” Jessica J. González, co-CEO of Free Press, a non-profit media advocacy group, told TheWrap. She said that Carr invoking that prospect is “absolutely an attempt to harass regulated entities.”\n\nCarr’s predecessor, former FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel, sounded a similar warning shortly before Trump’s inauguration, saying the commission “should not be the president’s speech police” and “should not be journalism’s censor-in-chief.” Yet under Carr, it feels as if that’s what has come to pass.\n\nIn some respects, there’s precedent for Gomez’s lonely crusade. During the George W. Bush administration two decades ago, Democratic commissioner Michael J. Copps became an outspoken critic of media consolidation, a minority position thanks to the GOP appointees led by pro-business chairman Michael Powell.\n\nCopps frequently spoke at industry forums and to groups like the Caucus for Television Producers, Writers & Directors, shining a light on the issue without derailing Powell’s deregulatory agenda.\n\nPart of the problem with the FCC’s recent actions is they feel so arbitrary and transparently political, pursuing clear motives — like targeting news divisions Trump dislikes, or investigating DEI policies — under the guise of public-interest concerns and whether broadcasters are fulfilling those obligations in exchange for their licenses.\n\nAs for the importance of Gomez taking a public stand, González said, “Dissents matter. Courts look at dissent when they’re determining whether or not an agency has exceeded its statutory authority, whether or not it was unconstitutional.” \n\nBeyond the legal ramifications, she added that dissent reverberates through the court of public opinion, while emboldening others to push back, whether that’s media companies, law firms or universities, all of which have come under siege.\n\n“It’s important for us to document government abuse and overreach,” González noted. “Can it stop what the Trump administration is doing? I still think that’s an open question.”\n\nGiven that, González noted that those companies and entities that have caved in to Trump’s demands are being “shortsighted,” a point Gomez echoed during the panel, while seeing a ray of hope in the example set by Harvard and others in refusing to bend the knee.\n\n“Capitulation breeds capitulation. But the good news is courage breeds courage,” she said.\n\nAt the Free Press forum, California Rep. Raul Ruiz applauded Gomez for her courage, which seems particularly admirable in light of Trump’s decision to fire Democratic appointees to the Federal Trade Commission, prompting speculation about how long she can hold out if she keeps challenging Carr’s legally dubious pursuits.\n\nUltimately, even in light of the Copps example, the stakes seem far higher for Gomez, given those who see the people engaging in this fight as bulwarks against rising authoritarianism that flouts the law and courts.\n\nFor now, Gomez isn’t fretting about potential consequences, but rather simply doing what she believes to be right. “I’m cognizant that I can be removed, but I’m not really worried about myself,” she said. “I am going to continue to speak out until I can’t anymore.”","summary":"Facing Brendan Carr and Trump’s punitive actions against media companies, the commission's outnumbered Democrat publicly pushes back\n\n\nThe post FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez Wages a Lonely Fight for Press Freedom in Trumpland appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/fcc-commissioner-anna-gomez-interview/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060225-Anna-Gomez-Brendan-Carr-1.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&quality=89&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-03 13:00:00","author":"Brian Lowry,President Biden","authors":["Brian Lowry","President Biden"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.214},{"id":327683054,"title":"Dutch government collapses, left rudderless [Obvious]","text":"Skip to content\n\nTry Ads-Free Fark\n\nIt's Not News, It's Fark\n\nHow To FarkLog In | Sign Up »\n\nForgot password?\n\n Turn on javascript (or enable it for Fark) for a better user experience.\n\nIf you can read this, either the style sheet didn't load or you have an older browser that doesn't support\nstyle sheets.

The state is politically split because it is also represented by independent Senator Angus King, and Governor Jane Mills, a Democrat. Former vice president Kamala Harris won the state by seven points in 2024 and former President Joe Biden won it by nine points in 2020.In 2020, when Collins was most recently up for reelection, she beat former Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon, a Democrat, with 51 percent of the vote. This was a smaller margin than when she won her 2014 reelection with a 37-point margin.If Collins loses her seat, it will prove more difficult for Republicans who currently control the Senate with a 53 to 47-seat majority.What To KnowAccording to a Pan Atlantic Research poll of 840 Maine likely voters, 49 percent of people see Collins favorably, 45 percent unfavorably, making her net favorability +4 percent.The polling was conducted between May 12 and May 26 with a margin of sampling error of +/- 3.5 percent.This is an improvement on previous polling released by the University of New Hampshire (UNH) in April, which showed 71 percent of respondents did not believe Collins should be reelected. That poll also showed only 12 percent of respondents had a favorable view of the Senator, and 58 percent had an unfavorable view.What People Are SayingSen. Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.), who ran the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) during the 2020 cycle told the Hill: \"In general, for any senator who's served their state and been out there and talking to the voters and engaging them and working to solve those problems, they're going to be effective with their voters to gain their support.\"James Melcher, a professor of political science at the University of Maine at Farmington, previously told Newsweek \"there's no question\" that a run by Collins would make it more difficult for Democrats to flip the seat.\"Mainers are ticket splitters to a large degree, and even in a polarized climate, many may vote for her and also vote for a D for governor,\" he said. \"She's also generally run well ahead of top of the ticket Republicans, though last time she lost a lot of D and independent support compared to past runs.\"Dan Shea, a professor of government at Colby College in Waterville, told Newsweek in March: \"It's a blue state that she can win. But the snag is that group is getting smaller and smaller. Swing voters might not be extinct in Maine, but they are on the endangered species list.\"What Happens NextWith over a year to go until the midterms, Collins' popularity and chances of winning her seat are likely to fluctuate depending on her policies and on what other politicians step into the ring in opposition.","summary":"Ahead of the November 2026 midterms, pollsters have analyzed who might win in the Maine Senate election.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/suasan-collins-maine-senate-election-polls-2080122","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2655601/susan-collins.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-03 11:46:10","author":"Kate Plummer","authors":["Kate Plummer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":327739064,"title":"PRRI's Robert P. Jones: \"Donald Trump sees himself as the king of kings\"","text":"The American people need to give up childish things and do the necessary hard work if they are to have any chance of saving their democracy from Trumpism and the larger right-wing antidemocracy revolutionary project. As James Baldwin counseled in a 1962 essay that appeared in the New York Times Book Review, “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.”\n\nUnfortunately, there are very few indications of such newfound maturity. The American people remain in a deep slumber and state of learned helplessness as Donald Trump and his forces continue with the shock and awe campaign against American democracy, civil society, the rule of law, the Constitution and human decency. The mainstream news media as an institution appears to have chosen a strategy of anticipatory obedience and compliance, if not collaboration, in normalizing Trumpism and his attempts to become the country’s first elected dictator. The Democratic Party is mired in infighting and a perpetual post-mortem about how and why it was routed by Donald Trump and his MAGA Republicans in the 2024 election. The concept of how to be an effective opposition party seems outside the grasp of its leaders. \n\nPro-democracy civil society organizations and the courts are trying to resist Trump’s attempts to neutralize them. Unfortunately, Donald Trump has great leverage in such a struggle and is using the near-limitless resources of the State to impose his will. For example, while the courts have repeatedly ordered a halt or pause on the Trump administration’s actions, it has and continues to treat such orders and rulings as optional, rather than as the commands of a co-equal branch of government, per the Constitution. \n\nDonald Trump was democratically elected. By choosing him over President Biden and then Vice President Kamala Harris, a majority of voters endorsed Donald Trump’s values, character, behavior and public aspirations to be a dictator on “day one”; This is a damning indictment.\n\nAfter more than 10 years of the Age of Trump and all the horrible things it has spawned and encouraged, public opinion polls show that there are still many tens of millions of Americans who will not abandon Donald Trump under any circumstances. Moreover, by some metrics, Donald Trump has actually expanded his base of support among the most disgruntled and alienated members of the American public. \n\nTo that point, polling by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) has consistently shown that white right-wing Christians are the bedrock of Donald Trump’s support. This level of devotion gives Trump a great amount of power and flexibility in his quest for unlimited power because unlike his predecessors, he has a cult-like following that he can use to claim democratic legitimacy combined with autocratic powers and a willingness to shatter America’s political and societal institutions to achieve his personal and political goals. This combination is a powerful force multiplier for competitive authoritarianism and perpetual MAGA rule by Donald Trump and his chosen successors.\n\nRobert P. Jones is the president and founder of Public Religion Research Institute. He is the author of the New York Times bestseller \"The Hidden Roots of White Supremacy and the Path to a Shared American Future,\" as well as \"White Too Long: The Legacy of White Supremacy in American Christianity.\"\n\nIn this conversation, Jones emphasizes how racism, white racial resentment, and white identity politics are central to Donald Trump’s appeal and the rise of his authoritarian populist movement. The denial and evasion of this reality by many white Americans — especially liberals and moderates in the news media and political class — explains why they have been so ineffective in stopping the rise of Trumpism and the larger antidemocracy project. Jones reflects on the Trump administration’s thought crime regime and what it feels like to be the author of a book that has been censored for being “unpatriotic” and contrary to “American values.” \n\nJones also explains how “conservative” so-called “values voters” have now replaced those values with Donald Trump and MAGA and see him as a tool to impose a White Christian nationalist theocracy on the American people. At the end of this conversation, Jones warns that the future of American democracy and “free and fair” elections in 2026 and beyond are far from guaranteed. \n\nYou and I have been engaging in a years-long conversation about the Age of Trump and America's embattled democracy. Trump is back in power as we warned. It has been more than 120 days, and matters are very dire here in the United States. How are you feeling? \n\nEven as someone who lives and breathes politics in the United States, I continue to be in a state of perpetual disbelief. On the one hand, there's not much at this point that President Trump could do that really would surprise me. But at the same time, the speed of the destruction he has commanded and unleashed on so many fronts makes my head spin. I was prepared for Trump's return to the presidency to be ugly and disastrous. But seeing the reality of it — especially up close here in Washington, DC, where so many patriotic public servants’ lives have been decimated by Trump’s attacks on our government institutions — has been very upsetting. I love my country, and it is painful to watch it being dismantled and destroyed by Trump and his MAGA forces. \n\nThe Age of Trump and this assault on multiracial democracy have been the norm for American society. Black and brown Americans have only been equal citizens under the law for 60 or so years. In the immediate sense, the Age of Trump is the White backlash and White frontlash to President Obama, the country's first black president. But its origins are much deeper. Many white Americans seem to be in shock and still stunned because they believed in an America that did not really exist; Trumpism is quintessentially American. \n\nI think you're right. I am white. Most white Americans are having a much harder time digesting what they're seeing from Donald Trump than Black Americans and other people of color, for the reasons you just explained. Most Black Americans have had the experience of living under a government that was openly malevolent toward them. They either directly experienced or otherwise know the history of Jim Crow racism. They have deeply felt these feelings before. It is not new, nor is its revival a shocking surprise. \n\nOn the other hand, white Americans, for most of our nation’s history, hypocritically said they supported democracy while still supporting white supremacy. The Civil Rights Movement fully exposed that hypocrisy and deep contradiction in American society, but white Americans have made heroic efforts not to see it. That is why so many White Americans are still, a decade after Trump’s first rise to power, expressing surprise at the MAGA movement's hostility to democracy.\n\nI also do not believe that White Americans as a group have the coping skills to deal with the challenge of Trumpism to our democracy and freedom in the same way that Black Americans do. Black Americans created institutions of resistance and survival, including the Black church and a music and larger cultural life that channels the energy of survival and resistance. Most white Americans do not have that kind of history and resilience to fall back upon. In all, for many white Americans, the Age of Trump left them with a deep sense of vertigo. They feel, many for the first time, that their world is spinning, but really, it’s just that we are all finally reaping the white supremacist whirlwind. \n\nHow are your colleagues who work in civil society organizations feeling right now? \n\nPeople are reacting in a wide range of ways. Some people are ducking and covering. For example, they are scrubbing their websites and materials of certain words and phrases such as \"diversity,\" \"equity,\" \"inclusion,\" \"race,\" \"racism,\" \"systemic,\" etc., etc. But there are other organizations and leaders saying \"No!\" We are not going to alter our mission statements and retreat. We have long histories and values we're committed to, and we're going to stay the course. And you know what? If we go down, then we are going to go down while being true to our mission. We at PRRI are committed to taking that course. \n\nThere are recent inspiring examples of that type of integrity and courage. Here is just one: the Episcopal Church refused to participate in the Trump administration's resettlement program for Afrikaners. The Episcopal Church has had a refugee resettlement program for more than four decades that's been in partnership with the United States government. They have helped needy and deserving people from all over the world get their footing here in the United States. Through common membership in the worldwide Anglican Communion, The American Episcopal Church is tightly connected with the Anglican Church of Southern Africa (ACSA). The Episcopal Church courageously refused to play its assigned role in what is essentially a Trump-produced white supremacist morality play. Moreover, the Episcopal Church, in an act of protest, is shutting down their entire four decades-long resettlement program rather than comply with helping the Trump administration with its white identity politics propaganda program. \n\n The Afrikaners are the descendants of and direct beneficiaries of Apartheid in South Africa. By privileging those Afrikaners over Black and brown refugees, many who have been waiting in line for years and who are actually deserving of help and protection, Trump is sending a very clear message about his and the administration's values and priorities. The Episcopal Church is a role model of resistance and principle in this dark time.\n\nAs part of its national whitewashing and Orwellian memory hole \"patriotic education\" program, the Trump administration is censoring books, targeting universities and colleges, and the American educational system more broadly, and even attacking museums and libraries. Your book was banned at the US Naval Academy. How does it feel to have such an \"honor\" and \"distinction?\" \n\nThe Nazis burned books to destroy knowledge. It was an analog world then. Now we are in a digital world, and the Trump administration can destroy and suppress knowledge and the truth with the push of a button. In addition to so much digital destruction, which materially would be the biggest book burning in history, the Trump administration is resorting to old-fashioned book bans. My book, White Too Long: The Legacy of White Supremacy in American Christianity, was one of 381 books, including seven books on Christianity, banned from the US Naval Academy. Guess what? Quite predictably, all those books were about Christianity's complicity with racism and white supremacy. But Hitler's book \"Mein Kampf\" was not banned. Apparently, books about Christianity's complicity with racism and white supremacy are too dangerous for midshipmen to read, but \"Mein Kampf\" is not. \n\nBut there has been important pushback. The New York Times published two different articles on the books being banned at the Naval Academy per Donald Trump and the Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s directives. The American Academy of Religion organized a webinar featuring me and the other banned religious studies authors to denounce the bans and support academic freedom. A retired Navy commander organized an effort to make the banned books available to midshipmen. As a result, most of the banned books are now being put back on the shelves as the US Naval Academy. Personally, for the Trump administration to ban one of my books makes me feel like I must be doing something right.\n\nTrump has now been president for more than four months, approximately 130 days. What are the polls telling us about his support among the American people, in particular white Christians?\n\nWhite Christians are still largely supporting Trump. If you look at the voting and polling patterns, there is a stunning dichotomy between predominantly White Christian groups and everyone else. A recent PRRI poll shows that Trump's favorability among white evangelical Protestants is 73%. Trump also has majority support among other white Christians, too. White Catholics: 53% favor Trump. White non-evangelical Protestants: 52% favor. The LDS church, sometimes called the Mormons: 51% favor. Non-white Christian groups, non-Christian religious groups, atheists, agnostics and unaffiliated all hold unfavorable views of Trump. \n\nGiven Trump's behavior such as claiming he is chosen by God, is a type of prophet, comparing himself to Jesus Christ, invoking God and Christianity to justify his policies that should be antithetical to that faith tradition and the Bible, and his willful gross failings — that are publicly documented — of his morality, character and behavior, how are white Christians justifying their continued support of him? \n\nThe rationales that White right-wing Christians use to justify their support of Trump are all over the map. This is because there has been a desperate search for a plausible theological justification for a predetermined political decision for Trump. Some of the rationales for Trump's behavior are farcical, such as the claim that he is a \"young Christian\" who is still maturing in his faith. We heard that in the beginning with Trump. That excuse has been dropped because Trump is not changing and does not want to change. One big challenge is that Trump has explicitly said that he has never had to ask for forgiveness for anything that he has done in his life. The most fundamental commitment of being a Christian is to admit that you've sinned and that you need forgiveness from God. Even Trump’s denial of that basic Christian tenet has proved no obstacle for his white Christian supporters. \n\nAt this point, years later, it’s clear that Trump's relationship to white Christians is transactional. Now it is more common to hear white Christians instead claiming that he is a tool of God and prophecy. Ultimately, white conservative Christians are trying to find a theological justification for what is really a political transaction that gives them the power they want in American society — and Trump is making it increasingly clear that much of that power is oriented around the preservation of white supremacy. \n\nWhat does it mean to be a \"values voter\" in the Age of Trump and his return to power?\n\nVery few people use that language anymore. We heard those types of appeals during the George W. Bush presidency and even in the beginning of Trump's first term. For obvious reasons, most white evangelicals have dropped that terminology. A major hub for white evangelical organizing in 2004, ivotevalues.com, for example, is now defunct. Now their appeals are about how \"Trump is going to protect our way of life\" and \"Trump is going to protect our religion.\" Only the thinnest veil of Christian morality is pulled over the MAGA movement today — it is transactional and about power. Even the cruelest policies, such as Trump’s illegal renditions of immigrants to hellhole prisons in other countries without due process guaranteed to all by the Constitution, evoke little protest. Or perhaps it is more accurate to say that, if we take this support seriously, such cruelty is in fact a reflection of the values of these voters.\n\nAfter the passing of Pope Francis. Trump shared an AI-generated image of himself as Pope Francis’ successor. How did white Christians, and white Catholics, specifically, react to such an act of disrespect? \n\nWhite evangelicals are the ones who get much of the attention from the news media and public. But white Catholics and white non-evangelical Protestants have supported Trump every time he has been on the ballot. There is no such thing as blasphemy from Donald Trump's point of view. There cannot be, since blasphemy depends on the acknowledgment of the sacred. Trump sees himself as the king of kings, the ruler of the world. Posting an image of himself as the new Pope fits Trump's brand and ego perfectly. He got very little pushback from his white Catholic base about that act of gross disrespect. \n\nWhat role do race and racism play in terms of white Christian support for Donald Trump and his MAGA movement? This is another area of great failure by the white-dominated mainstream American news media. There are the same evasions and rhetorical tricks applied in the news media's discussions of \"working class\" support for Donald Trump. Race is central here and not coincidental and/or peripheral. \n\nWhen I hear \"working class,\" I always add \"white\" to the front of those two words. When I hear \"Christian nationalism,\" I do the same thing. To your point, if you look at the data, you don't see huge class breaks among African Americans, for example, in terms of support for Trump. There is economic anxiety on both sides of the color line. But non-whites suffer much more from economic disadvantage and inequality than do white Americans. \n\nWhat we found here at PRRI, looking at the data going back to 2016, is that both economic and racial anxiety are independent predictors of support for Trump. If you were making a recipe, it would be two parts white racial anxiety and one part economic anxiety that made up the toxic cocktail that drove people to support Donald Trump. However, among Latinos in particular, there was an economic headwind that really hurt Kamala Harris and helped Donald Trump among that group. Those roads were mostly paved by economic concerns. There is also research that suggests that some Latinos and other non-whites supported Trump because they wanted a type of honorary Whiteness. \n\nStart your day with essential news from Salon.\nSign up for our free morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nBut our 100-day poll shows that the group that has moved the farthest away from Trump is Latino Protestants, a group that voted two-thirds for Trump in 2024. Trump's favorability is down from 51% to 32% among that group in just 100 days. The economic chaos Trump has unleashed, together with Trump's nativism, racism and the violence that is being visited upon Latinos as part of the mass deportations, is pushing them away from Trump. \n\nIs there anything that Donald Trump could conceivably do that would cost him the support of his white Christian followers, or his MAGA people, more generally? \n\nThe public opinion research shows that Donald Trump is a fairly unpopular person in terms of his favorability. In 2016, his favorability was only 24% before he secured the nomination and became the official Republican presidential candidate. Then partisanship takes over, and the Republican Party rallies around him. Since his first term, Trump’s favorability is consistently at about 40 to 45 percent. That is his ceiling and floor. But Trump’s favorability among Republicans has never dipped below 70 percent. That support is rock solid, and there is virtually nothing Trump can do for the Republican base to not support him. In fact, in one of our polls here at PRRI, we asked people who had favorable views of Trump the following question: Is there anything Trump can do to lose your support? Two-thirds of the respondents said there is absolutely nothing Trump could do to lose my support. Trump's MAGA base is that locked in. It is going to take independent voters moving away from Trump to potentially weaken him to any significant and/or long-term amount. \n\nAs for some hope, the polls do show that Trump's tariffs, his corruption and disregard for the rule of law, his abuses of power, and his attacks on the social safety net are hurting him with independent voters. Once the impact of the tariffs hits, I think we may see even bigger swings. If Trump launches mass deportations that feature militarized internment camps for undocumented immigrants in this country, that will also be another inflection point. But Trump’s base will be with him: six out of ten Republicans support military internment camps for undocumented people. \n\nWhy believe that given Donald Trump and his forces’ autocratic and increasingly fascist and authoritarian assaults on democracy and the rule of law, there will even be “free and fair” elections in 2026 and beyond? That is a huge assumption that hangs over all these conversations about the future and resistance to Trump and the MAGA revolutionary project’s drive for unlimited power. \n\nWhen I talk about the midterms, I preface that with the qualifier, \"if we have free and fair elections.\" It is very conditional. In theory, if the Democrats take back control of Congress, they could reverse some of Trump's most onerous policies. But, like you, I am quite worried that the midterms and beyond will not be \"free and fair\" and that Trump and the Republicans will basically have sham elections in key states to \"legitimate\" their rule. \n\nI am from Mississippi. Elections during Jim Crow segregation were supposedly \"free and fair,\" and they were anything but. This is part of America's living history and present — the Republicans in the South are rolling back civil rights and voting rights laws to bring back a 21st-century version of Jim Crow at the ballot box. This is not something in the distant past or in a distant country. American democracy and its principle of \"free and fair\" elections are not something to be taken for granted. In fact, truly free and fair elections have only been with us for about one-quarter of America’s nearly 250-year history. And that achievement will not be preserved without an active effort to protect it next fall.","summary":"\"There is virtually nothing Trump can do for the Republican base to not support him\"","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/06/03/prris-robert-p-jones-donald-sees-himself-as-the-king-of-kings/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2020/02/donald-trump-you-should-see-me-in-a-crown-0212201.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-03 10:00:31","author":"Chauncey Devega","authors":["Chauncey Devega"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.099},{"id":327622920,"title":"Kamala Harris headlines DNC fundraiser as she tries to escape ‘lasting stain’ of 2024","text":"Although more Democrats blame former President Joe Biden for their current political predicament, some are finding it “hard to forgive [Harris] for running a failed campaign that let Trump back into the White House,” according to Democratic strategist Garry South.\n\nThat is on top of Harris’s strategy not to announce her decision regarding the governor’s race until the end of summer, as speculation mounts that she is also considering another presidential campaign.\n\n“It’s as if she feels a sense of entitlement that allows her to take her sweet time, and not have to even put out a minimal effort to do the things other candidates have to do to run for governor,” South told the Washington Examiner. “She didn’t even bother to show up in person at the state Democratic convention this weekend. I’m sure as a former vice president she was just terribly busy.”\n\nClaremont McKenna College politics professor John Pitney agreed Harris’s appeal among Democrats has diminished since she replaced Biden at the last minute in the election against President Donald Trump.\n\n“Back then, she drew enthusiastic crowds because she was the alternative to Trump. Now she is just one of many Democrats who hope to be the nominee in 2028,” Pitney told the Washington Examiner. “Unlike Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020, she lost the popular vote to Trump, which does not help.”\n\nBut former California Democratic Party adviser Bob Mulholland defended Harris, contending she continues to be a draw, including at this week’s fundraiser, regardless of ending her $1 billion campaign $20 million in debt.\n\n“[The late Richard] Nixon lost the 1960 presidential election and the 1962 California governor race but did not spend the next six years talking about what went wrong,” Mulholland told the Washington Examiner.\n\nDemocratic strategist Mike Nellis, who worked for Harris’s 2020 presidential campaign, similarly defended the former vice president but was less defensive concerning Biden. Instead, Nellis encouraged Democrats to “come up with a strong answer about what happened” with the former president after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), for example, repeated last month that the party is future-focused.\n\n“It’s clear that a small number of people were lying to a lot of us about what was going on, and I don’t think we can run away from that,” Nellis told the Washington Examiner. “It’s a real political problem that everybody’s going to have to take seriously if we want to win in 2026 and 2028.”\n\nTo that end, California Republican-turned-independent strategist Dan Schnur predicted Biden would be “an immense obstacle” for Harris as reporting from the likes of Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, published in their book Original Sin, underscores the depth of deception by Biden aides about the former president’s physical and cognitive decline during his last years in office. For instance, aides sought to put distance between Cabinet members and Biden to shield the former president from them and the public, per the book.\n\n“Whether Harris runs for governor next year, or president two years after that, she is the one Democrat who will have no deniability whatsoever on questions of Biden’s decline,” Schnur told the Washington Examiner. \n\nHe added: “Every other candidate, including Biden Cabinet members, can find at least a semi-plausible way of not answering the question. But except for the president’s doctor and his wife, Harris was supposed to know more about Biden’s health than any other person on the planet. She will come across as either evasive or complicit, or both. There’s no way for her to dodge this one.”\n\nFormer California Republican strategist Duf Sundheim went further, reiterating that Harris had “a moral and constitutional duty to speak out about [Biden’s] condition.”\n\n“Those who question whether her failure to do so will be an issue on the campaign trail risk trivializing a significant issue,” Sundheim told the Washington Examiner. “Her failure to address President Biden’s obvious decline has left a lasting stain — not only on her tenure as vice president, but also on her credibility as a candidate for any future office.”\n\nIn fact, the issue has already emerged on the campaign trail, with former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa last month claiming Harris and former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, a declared candidate for governor, were complicit in protecting Biden amid his decline.\n\nHarris has given herself until the end of the summer to announce a campaign for governor, a race that already has nine declared candidates, including Becerra, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, and even former Rep. Katie Porter, who was criticized for creating a toxic work environment for congressional aides while she was on Capitol Hill. However, both Kounalakis and Porter have indicated they will withdraw their candidacies should Harris announce a bid.\n\nHarris was more than 20 percentage points ahead of her nearest rival, Porter, 31% to 8%, in the most recent poll, a survey conducted by Emerson College Polling, Inside California Politics, and the Hill in April, though 39% of respondents remained undecided at the time of the public opinion research.\n\nHarris’s fundraiser on Tuesday, promoted as a roundtable with the vice president, is being hosted by author and researcher Gretchen Sisson and Facebook co-founder Andrew McCollum. Harris delivered her first major address as a former vice president at the Emerge Gala in April, again in San Francisco, but has started making more and more public appearances, including during a real estate conference last month in Australia.\n\nREPUBLICANS MOCK DEMOCRATS FOR $20 MILLION ‘SPEAKING WITH AMERICAN MEN’ STUDY\n\n“They are counting on the notion that, if they can make some people afraid, it will have a chilling effect on others,” Harris said during the Emerge Gala. “But what they’ve overlooked is that fear isn’t the only thing that’s contagious. Courage is contagious.”\n\nNeither Harris nor the DNC immediately responded to the Washington Examiner’s requests for comment.","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris has not even announced her candidacy to become California&#8216;s next governor, but her possible campaign has already hit snags.

Psaki, a former Biden White House press secretary who has insisted she never saw signs the former president had declined while she worked for him, saw an increased role as part of MSNBC’s overhaul when programming changes were announced earlier this year. Psaki took over MSNBC’s coveted 9 p.m. ET timeslot on Tuesday through Fridays last month as \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" returned to only airing on Mondays, after Maddow temporarily returned to airing five nights a week during President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office. \"The Briefing with Jen Psaki\" averaged 971,000 total viewers from its May 6 debut through May 28, shedding a staggering 47% of the audience that Maddow and Alex Wagner pulled in at 9 p.m. ET throughout 2025. JEN PSAKI, THE EX-BIDEN FLACK WHO DEFENDED HIS MENTAL FITNESS, LAUNCHES EXPANDED ROLE AT MSNBC Psaki has also hemorrhaged viewers from the advertiser-coveted demographic of adults aged 25-54, averaging 78,000 for a 52% drop compared to the 161,000 demo viewers that Maddow and Wagner averaged on Tuesday through Fridays at 9 p.m. ET before the former Biden spokesperson took over. Wagner hosted Tuesdays through Fridays in Maddow's usual spot before Trump's inauguration. The network also canceled Joy Reid’s program \"The ReidOut\" and replaced it with \"The Weeknight,\" an ensemble program featuring former Vice President Kamala Harris spokesperson Symone Sanders-Townsend, Alicia Menendez, the daughter of disgraced former Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and Michael Steele, the former Republican National Committee chair who now staunchly opposes the GOP. \"The Weeknight\" debuted on May 5 and averaged 776,000 total viewers through May 28 for a 12% drop compared to the 886,000 total viewers that \"The ReidOut\" and other temporary programs managed throughout 2025 in the 7 p.m. ET timeslot before changes went into effect. CREDIBILITY CRISIS: PRESS DISMISSED HUR REPORT ON BIDEN'S MEMORY ISSUES LONG BEFORE CONCERNS BECAME UNDENIABLE \"The Weeknight\" shed even more viewers from the key demo, as the new MSNBC show averaged 72,000 for a 20% decrease, compared to the 90,000 demo viewers who tuned into the 7 p.m. ET timeslot before the ensemble program kicked off. Another new show, \"The Weekend: Primetime,\" with Antonia Hylton, Catherine Rampell, Elise Jordan and Ayman Mohyeldin, is down 11% among total viewers and 6% in the demo compared to MSNBC programming that used to occupy its timeslot. Despite the programming overhaul, MSNBC had its second-worst May in history among both total day and primetime in the demo. For the month, MSNBC settled for a dismal average of 49,000 viewers among the critical demo to lose to CNN, which averaged 59,000. During primetime, CNN averaged 76,000 demo viewers and MSNBC finished with an average of only 73,000. AMERICANS CONTINUE TO CHOOSE FOX NEWS CHANNEL AS NETWORK DOMINATES MAY, TOPS ABC DURING WEEKDAY PRIMETIME Only one of MSNBC’s new shows is outdrawing its timeslot predecessor, as \"The Weekend\" with Jonathan Capehart, Eugene Daniels, and Jackie Alemany is up 24% in total viewers and 29% among the demo since launching on May 3. An MSNBC insider pushed back on the notion the network was struggling, pointing to the historic news cycle that occurred during Trump’s first 100 days in office that helped attract viewers before the new programs launched. The insider also noted that Psaki has built on the audience of her lead-in while competing in the NBA and NHL playoffs. MSNBC’s viewership issues come as Comcast gears up to spin off NBCUniversal cable assets, including MSNBC, into a separate company called Versant that will not be tied to NBC News.

'I'm convinced something's coming unless we can find them. It’s only a matter of time.' \n\nHoman described the situation as the most preventable national security threat in American history and one he believes could rival, or even surpass, the devastation of 9/11 if the government doesn't act swiftly. \n\nOver the past four years, millions of migrants have either turned themselves in or evaded capture entirely, overwhelming the country's immigration infrastructure. \n\nBut Homan says what keeps him up at night are the two million illegals who avoided apprehension altogether with many paying smugglers premium fees to evade authorities.\n\n'These two million known gotaways scare the hell out of me,' Homan admitted. 'They crossed the border. We don't know where they are now.\n\n'They could have paid half of what they paid to cross the border, turn themselves in, get released the same day, get a free airline ticket, a hotel room, three meals a day, free medical care, and work authorization. But they didn't. They paid to avoid being fingerprinted, to avoid being vetted. Why?' Homan questioned.\n\n'This should scare the hell out of every American. I've been doing this for 40 years. I've never seen anything like this,' Homan said.\n\n'This is the biggest national security vulnerability this country has ever seen,' he went on. 'And thanks to what they did in just four years, we'll be dealing with the consequences for the next decade.' \n\nThe gravity of Homan's warning was amplified by real-world events just one day earlier. \n\nIn Boulder, Colorado, 12 people were wounded in an antisemitic terror attack carried out by a man using Molotov cocktails and a makeshift flamethrower. \n\nThe suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is a 45-year-old Egyptian national who entered the US on a tourist visa in 2022, later obtained asylum protections, and was issued a work permit - all under Biden-era immigration policies. \n\nBut his work visa expired in March, making him illegally present in the country at the time of the attack.\n\nHoman seized on the attack as proof of what he called the Biden administration's reckless approach to immigration.\n\n'Even through the legal process, the Biden administration was bringing people in unvetted, handing out work visas like they're candy,' he said. \n\nWhile Biden campaigned in 2020 on restoring America's image as a haven for the persecuted, his administration's policies soon faced backlash from both political opponents and Democratic-led cities burdened by the sheer number of incoming migrants. \n\nAs the crisis deepened, Biden's team shifted strategies combining tougher asylum rules with new pathways for legal migration. \n\nStill, arrests at the border skyrocketed to historic levels during his tenure before declining ahead of Trump's inauguration for a second term in January.\n\nHoman's warnings come as the Trump administration touts its sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration: new mass deportation efforts, expanded ICE raids, and even the use of US military planes to deport migrants - in some cases sending them to the Guantanamo Bay detention center or El Salvador. \n\nSince Trump's return to office, about 6,500 active-duty troops have been deployed to the southern border, a massive increase over previous years. \n\nWhile these troops don't directly interact with migrants, they assist Border Patrol in surveillance and detection operations, a necessary reinforcement as the administration grapples with the fallout from what Homan calls 'four years of chaos.'\n\nCritics argue that Biden's policies and his decision to hand immigration responsibilities to Vice President Kamala Harris early in his first term created an enforcement vacuum. \n\nHarris, tasked with addressing the 'root causes' of migration, made a single trip to the border nearly six months into Biden's presidency, drawing criticism from opponents for what they saw as a lack of urgency.\n\nHoman says only now are the consequences becoming apparent.\n\n'We are looking for the bad guys while protesters assault ICE officers and members of Congress grandstand outside our facilities,' Homan fumed.\n\n'Where was the oversight when 10.5 million illegals crossed the border? Where was the responsibility when over 8 million were released into the interior?","summary":"Border czar Tom Homan is warning of an imminent threat few are prepared for.

While on “Hannity,” the Fox host brought on Biden’s former special assistant and pressed him on whether he had seen any decline during his time in the White House.\n\n“Michael, you’re going to come on this program, and you’re going to look America in the eye, and you’re going to tell us that you did not see any cognitive decline in Joe Biden? Because we saw it. We chronicled it starting in 2019,” Hannity said. “You’re going to tell us that?”\n\n“Well, I am because I’ve been very consistent about that, Sean, with all of your colleagues on all of the Fox News programming since I left the White House at the end of 2022. That my three years — ” LaRosa attempted to push back until Hannity cut him off.\n\nIn May, CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson released “Original Sin,” detailing concerns about President Joe Biden’s cognitive state during his time in office. According to the two reporters, who interviewed a handful of sources, aides had grown so concerned about the former president that at one point they considered putting him in a wheelchair following the 2020 election. (RELATED: Biden Can’t Quite Stick Landing On Pronouncing Most Famous Line In Founding Document)\n\n“Michael, let me interrupt you,” Hannity said. “I don’t believe you. I think you’re full of crap. Let me be honest. Let me be straight here. We play — we have tape after tape after tape. I could spend the next hour.”\n\n“We spent an hour on Friday playing him struggling, shaking air, not knowing where to go, talking to dead people. He could barely utter a sentence,” Hannity added. “He was a shell of his former self. Now, either you don’t have eyes to see or ears to hear or you’re just, you know, politically blinded. If I’m going to be charitable or just a political hack. But you can’t say you didn’t see it. I don’t believe you.”\n\nDuring Biden’s time in office, videos of the president circulated online, showing him stumbling at times and misspeaking. The White House’s former press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre labeled the videos as “cheap fakes,” saying that they were used to make the former president look bad. She blamed Republicans.\n\n“OK, so, Sean, you have the highest rated programming on Fox News, on the highest rated cable network. In 2019 and 2020, the American people saw the same thing, had the same access that you did,” LaRosa said. “He still won by seven million votes and has the most votes ever received by any president in American history. I’m not here to defend the cover-up.”\n\nHannity again interrupted LaRosa, pressing whether he saw Biden’s decline during the 2024 presidential debate against President Donald Trump, to which he replied, “yes.” LaRosa told the Fox host that it was the first time for him and “many people” that Biden’s mental state became apparent.\n\n“I don’t believe any of you. I just don’t believe it. I think you’re so politically biased. You can’t see through. You hate Trump so much you can’t see through the lens of politics,” Hannity said.\n\nIn June 2024, Biden appeared onstage alongside Trump, delivering a disastrous debate performance in which he struggled to finish arguments and, at one point, froze mid-sentence. Immediately following the event, Democrats and media pundits began asking whether he could serve another four years in office.\n\nA list of Democrat lawmakers publicly called for Biden to step aside, with party donors withholding millions until he was taken off the ticket. By July 21, he announced he would withdraw from the 2024 race. Biden endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris as his choice for the party’s nominee.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

LIZ PEEK: DONALD TRUMP IS OUR PRESIDENT AND DEMOCRATS HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO In the portrait unveiled on Monday, Trump is wearing a blue suit coat, white button-up shirt and a red tie. In both images, he has an American Flag pinned to his coat. The president also shows little expression in the new portrait. White House officials told Fox News Digital the photo was taken by White House photographer Daniel Torok. TRUMP PORTRAIT HE CLAIMED WAS 'PURPOSEFULLY DISTORTED' TO BE TAKEN DOWN FROM COLORADO CAPITOL As of Monday evening, the photo is hanging in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, and it will eventually start rolling out to other offices and federal buildings. Trump’s new portrait was unveiled just days after he announced that he was firing Kim Sajet, the director of the National Portrait Gallery, for being a \"strong supporter\" of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). He announced Sajet’s termination in a post on Truth Social on Friday afternoon. DONALD TRUMP FIRES NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY DIRECTOR FOR BEING 'STRONG SUPPORTER' OF DEI \"Upon the request and recommendation of many people, I am hereby terminating the employment of Kim Sajet as Director of the National Portrait Gallery,\" the president wrote. \"She is a highly partisan person, and a strong supporter of DEI, which is totally inappropriate for her position. Her replacement will be named shortly. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" A White House official told Fox News Digital that Sajet had donated $3,982 to Democrats, including the presidential campaigns of former President Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton. Sajet also reportedly donated to other Democrats, including former Vice President Kamala Harris.

The caption of the photo reads, \"Impeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials. After losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election.

(KGO) -- California Democrats are hoping to rally momentum following disappointing results in the 2024 election and begin defining their leadership beyond Governor Gavin Newsom, who is termed out in 2026.\n\nThe question of party leadership was front in center at the California Democratic Party convention in Anaheim over the weekend. Despite more than a dozen declared candidates in the race to replace Newsom, the clearest front-runner may still be on the sidelines: former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe 2026 gubernatorial race is already packed with more than a dozen Democratic and Republican candidates combined, but none have emerged as a dominant contender.\n\nVIDEO: Harris accuses Trump of 'wholesale abandonment' of American ideals in major post-election speech\n\n\"If Harris did decide to run, she would still be a very strong front-runner,\" said UC Berkeley political professor Dan Schnur. \"But she'd probably have the most uphill fight of any front-runner that I've ever seen in politics, California or elsewhere.\"\n\nHarris did not attend the convention in her home state, but appeared in a brief video to attendees.\n\n\"Our fight to advance freedom and justice must continue,\" Harris said in a pre-recorded message.\n\nSome political analysts say that Harris's fate could be intertwined with mounting questions about former President Joe Biden's cognitive health.\n\n\"The biggest challenge for Harris is the Joe Biden question,\" said Schnur. \"What did she know and when did she know it?\"\n\nFormer Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa - a 2026 candidate for California governor - recently slammed both Harris and Biden's former health secretary for not being transparent about the president's health at the end of his term.\n\nRELATED: Who's running for CA governor to replace termed-out Gavin Newsom?

It's 'Make New Jersey Great Again,' Trump said, adding that if Democrats retain power in Trenton, the state 'economy will wither and die and you'll be living in a nightmare of chaos and crime.'\n\nThe president warned that 'you sort of have that to a certain extent now.' \n\nTrump's call for early voting echoed the pitch he made to voters in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nCiattarelli said his first executive order if elected would be to end any sanctuary policies for immigrants in the country illegally. \n\nCurrently, the state attorney general has directed local law enforcement not to assist federal agents in civil immigration matters.\n\nThere is no legal definition for sanctuary city policies , but they generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.\n\nCiattarelli also said the attorney general he appoints if he wins won't be bringing lawsuits against the White House. \n\nNew Jersey's current attorney general has pursued several high-profile challenges to the president's agenda, including a case challenging Trump's order calling for the end of birthright citizenship .\n\nCiattarelli is running against former radio talk host Bill Spadea, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac and a southern New Jersey contractor named Justin Barbera.\n\nEarly in-person voting begins Tuesday and goes through Sunday. Primary day is June 10, though voters have been sending mail-in ballots in since late April. \n\nThough the primary isn't over, Ciattarelli hinted at what attacks against his eventual Democratic challenger in the general election might be, saying the party's eight years in the governorship and more than two decades of power in the legislature have been a failure.\n\nThe Democratic field isn't set. There's a six-way contest between Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill; Mayors Ras Baraka of Newark and Steven Fulop of Jersey City; former state Senate President Steve Sweeney; and teacher's union president Sean Spiller.\n\nNew Jersey tilts Democratic in presidential and Senate elections in particular, and the party has a roughly 800,000 voter registration advantage over Republicans. \n\nBut independents make up a significant bloc as well, and voters have tended to alternate between Democratic and Republican administrations for governor. \n\nMurphy crawled over the finish line to a second term, ending with 51.22 percent of the vote to 48.00 against former state GOP lawmaker Ciattarelli. \n\nIt was expected to be an easy victory for Murphy for weeks leading up to Election Day.\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to the Ciattarelli campaign for comment.","summary":"Donald Trump claimed Monday that one long-time blue state is ready to leave the Democrat 'horror show' starting with this year's gubernatorial elections.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14774307/donald-trump-deep-blue-state-democrat-horror-show.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/03/03/98982629-0-image-a-23_1748917570422.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-03 02:32:47","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

But right now, I think in the next four years and in the future, the fact that there is this established Indian-American population here and so many people in India who know the country and know the people who are here doing great things, having great opportunities.\"\nShe added: \"When we were visiting recently, I was just struck by the number of people who came up to me to say how much they loved our country, how they visited family, how they visited just for pleasure, that they were hoping for a close relationship. Looking forward, and I think these personal ties actually really have something to do with it.\"\nThe Vances were in India in April for the first vice-presidential visit in 13 years, coming after Vice-President Joe Biden's in 2013, when he was a part of the then President Barack Obama's administration.\nThe succeeding two Vice-Presidents -- Mike Pence and Kamala Harris, who is also of Indian descent, never got around to make the trip.\n\"It really was the trip of a lifetime for us, my children had never been to India. What would the pandemic and J.D. century mean to politics and all that, and so they'd grown up just knowing so much about this country, the stories, the food, the relationships with grandparents and friends, but they had never actually seen it.

So they are very into him. They just love him. And he really cemented his status by giving our five-year-old a birthday present that day. So when we were able to visit his home, they just sort of ran up. They were hugging him.

The debt-laden New York-based company currently has only five board members, including controlling shareholder Shari Redstone, who serves as chairwoman. The Redstone family holds nearly 77% of Paramount's voting shares, giving the heiress tremendous sway. In a proxy filing Monday, Paramount asked shareholders to elect seven directors at its July 2 annual meeting. The slate includes Redstone and three recruits: attorney Mary Boies (a member of the firm led by her husband David Boies); Silicon Valley venture capital executive Charles E. Ryan ; and former Massachusetts trial court judge Roanne Sragow Licht. In addition to Redstone, three longtime board members — Linda M. Griego, Susan Schuman and Barbara M. Byrne — will stand for reelection. Board member Judith A. McHale has decided to step down. The company has grappled with a series of setbacks since it announced its sale to tech scion David Ellison's Skydance Media last July. The company took a $6-billion write-down on its cable television networks business, in yet another sign that Hollywood is reckoning with the ongoing deterioration of the traditional television business. Leading independent director Charles Phillips left the board in October. His exit came six months after three other directors — Rob Klieger, Nicole Seligman and Dawn Ostroff — abruptly departed as the panel was struggling over terms of Redstone's planned Paramount sale. In late October, President Trump filed a lawsuit in Texas over his dismay with edits of a \"60 Minutes\" interview of then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the closing weeks of the election. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, opened an inquiry to determine whether the edits rose to the level of news distortion. Trump doubled the amount of damages he was seeking to $20 billion. Paramount has been defending against the lawsuit. In a court filing last week, Trump's lawyers asserted the president suffered \"mental anguish\" due to the \"60 Minutes\" broadcast. Redstone's desire to settle Trump's suit over the \"60 Minutes\" edits has carved deep divides within the company. 1st Amendment experts have called Trump's lawsuit frivolous; CBS News executives and other journalists believe it is a shakedown to exploit the vulnerable company that is desperate to have the FCC approve the sale to Skydance. The ruckus over the edits contributed to the departure of two top CBS News executives. Wendy McMahon, the president of CBS News and Stations, stepped down under pressure last month. In April, \"60 Minutes\" executive producer Bill Owens departed. Redstone has expressed her dissatisfaction with CBS News' coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. Last month, three Democrat U.S. senators warned Redstone that the company could face allegations of bribery if they write a big check to mollify Trump in an effort to facilitate the FCC's review of the Skydance takeover. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Paramount offered Trump $15 million to make the lawsuit go away, but he declined. It's been nearly 11 months since Paramount agreed to be sold to Skydance in an $8-billion deal that would inject $1.5 billion in capital into Paramount's battered balance sheet. Paramount has not revised its guidance on when it expects the deal to close — but the contractual deadline is early October. As part of its proxy statement, the company again detailed the compensation packages — totaling $148 million to the top three executives and ousted Chief Executive Bob Bakish, who received compensation valued at $87 million. Co-CEO George Cheeks was paid $22.2 million. His counterparts Brian Robbins and Chris McCarthy were paid $19.6 million and $19.5 million, respectively, according to the filing.","summary":"The Shari Redstone-controlled company has grappled with a series of setbacks since it announced its sale to tech scion David Ellison's Skydance Media last July.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-06-02/trump-troubles-fcc-paramount-nominates-new-board-members","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dcafeae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+249/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F76%2Ff6%2Fad0f4a464b108f1d7dbe66f2922f%2Fla-photos-1staff-635","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-02 23:59:17","author":"Meg James","authors":["Meg James"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.233},{"id":327479074,"title":"Trump made law firms his pawns—and he wants Paramount to follow suit","text":"Paramount Global is looking to settle President Donald Trump’s meritless lawsuit against its CBS News division—and the current proposal is terrible, even by Trump-era standards. \n\nBroadly speaking, there are two ways for companies to get the litigation-happy Trump off their back: They can choose to give him millions of dollars in cash, or they can choose to give him millions of dollars in free services. Paramount is taking a different approach by reportedly offering both cash on the barrelhead, as other media outlets have, as well as millions of dollars worth of free services, a hallmark of recent law firm settlements with the administration. \n\nSince bribery remains technically—and only technically—illegal, companies can’t just write the president an eight-figure check to secure some protection. Trump has solved that problem, though, by bringing baseless lawsuits that allow for that cash to be treated as a “settlement.” Think of it as a mobster using the judicial system to launder protection money. \n\nTrump has no real legal basis for these suits, but that doesn’t matter. They’re a cudgel to ensure compliance with the administration’s agenda. And hey, if Trump gets some extra millions out of these deals, that’s just the cost of doing business. \n\nBefore Trump even took office, ABC News gave him $15 million for his presidential library and an additional $1 million for legal costs to settle Trump’s spurious defamation suit against the network. See also Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, which gave Trump $25 million to close the books on his lawsuit over how he had been harmed by having his account on Facebook suspended after he incited an insurrection. Elon Musk agreed to settle Trump’s lawsuit against X over basically the same thing, giving Trump $10 million on top of the quarter-billion he spent to get Trump elected. \n\nTrump’s lawsuit against Paramount was spurred by a “60 Minutes interview” with Vice President Kamala Harris, which Trump alleges was edited to show Harris in a better light. That’s rich coming from someone who continually benefits from the mainstream media sanewashing his incoherent rhetoric. \n\nParamount offered $15 million to get out from under the lawsuit, but Trump wants $25 million to cover what he said was $20 billion worth of “mental anguish” and CBS damaging his role as a “content creator.” Yes, the sitting president essentially wants Paramount to give him money because they made him sad and hurt him in his role as an influencer. The so-called leader of the free world is behaving like an Instagram influencer suing someone for stealing their vibe. \n\nExcept in this case, the plaintiff can bring the full weight of the government to bear because Paramount needs approval from the Federal Communications Commission for its pending merger with film production company Skydance Media. Trump’s pick for the head of the FCC, Brendan Carr, is extremely eager to use the agency to carry out Trump’s political attacks. Before Carr even got in the door, he had already said he’d consider Trump’s FCC complaint against CBS, which tracks Trump’s lawsuit, and that the complaint “is something that is likely to arise in the FCC’s review of that transaction.” The entirely unsubtle message here is that Carr will use Trump’s spurious allegations about CBS News to block a multibillion-dollar merger.\n\nRelated | Trump’s nominee for FCC chair will be his media hitman\n\nSo, Paramount bigwigs feel like they need to settle this, but it looks like they can’t get it done with cash alone. One possible settlement proposal would require CBS to run millions of dollars in public service ads for the administration’s pet causes, like fighting antisemitism and helping veterans. Of course, the administration isn’t actually committed to either of those causes. Trump has hired numerous bigots with histories of antisemitic remarks, and of course Elon Musk, after throwing two Nazi salutes at the inauguration, was rewarded with getting to destroy the government via his stint leading the Department of Government Efficiency. As for veterans? Trump is gutting the Department of Veterans Affairs, proposing to cut tens of thousands of employees, and has already compromised the health care available to those who served our country. \n\nNonetheless, Paramount appears willing to pretend that Trump is sincere about these issues and ready to agree to air millions of dollars’ worth of public service ads to push Trump’s interests. This would normally be the sort of thing the FCC would jump at reviewing, but newly installed Commissioner Carr is certainly not going to try to scuttle a deal that gives Trump everything he wants. \n\nWhile Paramount might want to pretend that the offer of free PSAs will involve generically nice spots about fighting bigotry and protecting veterans, Trump’s deals with law firms show otherwise. In order to sidestep a Trump executive order targeting them, some big-name law firms have pledged a total of nearly $1 billion in free legal services to the administration, and it’s becoming pretty clear those free legal services will be deployed for whatever Trump wants. \n\nThe executive order, declaring that Trump was “strengthening and unleashing” law enforcement, said that those fancy firms will represent random law enforcement officers facing charges or civil suits over misconduct. \n\nIf Paramount wants a look at its future should executives agree to this deal, peep Trump ally Greta Van Susteren, who cold-called one of the firms, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, to demand they handle a case for a veteran who wants to sue a Michigan judge for issuing a protective order during his divorce proceedings. After Skadden said they could not represent the veteran but could offer services in a support role, Van Susteren went on X to blast Skadden as “disgraceful”—making sure to tag Trump, of course. \n\nNo doubt CBS News will love getting calls from all of the MAGA movement’s lesser lights, demanding they film freebie ads for whatever bee they’ve got in their bonnet that week. It’s just the price of bending the knee to Trump.","summary":"Paramount Global is looking to settle President Donald Trump’s meritless lawsuit against its CBS News division—and the current proposal is terrible, even by Trump-era standards. \n\n\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two ways for companies to get the litigation-happy Trump off their back: They can choose to give him millions of dollars in cash, or they can choose to give him millions of dollars in free services.

Looking forward, and I think these personal ties actually really have something to do with it.\"\n\nThe Vances were in India in April for the first vice-presidential visit in 13 years, coming after Vice-President Joe Biden's in 2013, when he was a part of the then President Barack Obama's administration.\n\nThe succeeding two Vice-Presidents -- Mike Pence and Kamala Harris, who is also of Indian descent, never got around to make the trip.\n\n\"It really was the trip of a lifetime for us, my children had never been to India. What would the pandemic and J.D. century mean to politics and all that, and so they'd grown up just knowing so much about this country, the stories, the food, the relationships with grandparents and friends, but they had never actually seen it. So it was just sort of mindblowing from their perspective. And then for me and J.D., I think it just could not have been any more special,\" Usha Vance said.\n\n\"We had the opportunity to see some of the greatest sights in north India. We're looking forward to our next trip and trying to get to the parts of the country where my family is from as well. And it just was sort of one hit after another, right? The most incredible food, the peacocks that we got to see everywhere we went, getting to see the Taj Mahal in the morning and appreciate it as the sun was just sort of coming up, and the cool skies and blue skies over in the background. And of course, as you mentioned, meeting the Prime Minister was really very special.\"\n\nThe Vances had met the Prime Minister Modi by this time.\n\nTheir first meeting was in Paris on the sidelines of an AI summit in February.\n\n\"They were sort of sleep deprived in Paris, and they saw an Indian man with a white beard and white hair, and they just put him the grandfather category immediately. So they are very into him. They just love him. And he really cemented his status by giving our five-year-old a birthday present that day. So when we were able to visit his home, they just sort of ran up. They were hugging him. He was just incredibly kind and generous to them.\"\n\nSource: IANS","summary":"Washington, June 3 (SocialNews.XYZ) US Second Lady Usha Vance has said that this was a time of opportunity in the bilateral relationship with India and spoke effusively of her recent visit to India along with...\n\n\nThe post Usha Vance says this is time of &#8216;great opportunity&#8217; in ties with India appeared first on Social News XYZ.","url":"https://www.socialnews.xyz/2025/06/02/usha-vance-says-this-is-time-of-great-opportunity-in-ties-with-india/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.socialnews.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/03/202506033419444.jpg?fit=740%2C399&quality=80&zoom=1&ssl=1?v=1748911205","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-02 23:29:37","author":"Gopi","authors":["Gopi"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.209},{"id":327463698,"title":"Paramount Global nominates three board directors as Skydance merger awaits approval - TradingView","text":"Paramount Global PARA nominated three new directors on Monday, seeking to boost its board strength to seven as it awaits regulatory approval for its $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media. \n\nParamount nominated Mary Boies, counsel to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, Charles Ryan, co-founder and general partner of Almaz Capital, and Roanne Sragow Licht, former justice and adjunct professor at Boston University and Roger Williams University. \n\nU.S. President Donald Trump filed a $10 billion lawsuit against Paramount-owned CBS News in October, alleging that the network deceptively edited an interview with then-vice president and presidential candidate Kamala Harris, to \"tip the scales in favor of the Democratic Party\" in the election.\n\nTrump's lawsuit is seen as a major roadblock to the Paramount-Skydance merger, according to some analysts. \n\nThe merger requires approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, which has authority over the transaction because it needs to approve the transfer of the broadcast television licenses held by CBS.\n\nParamount, chaired by Shari Redstone, reportedly offered $15 million to settle the suit.\n\nTrump raised his claim for damages to $20 billion in February.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last week that the company wanted to ensure it had a full board in place in case its negotiations with Trump to settle his lawsuit fell through.\n\nParamount is scheduled to hold its annual stockholder meeting on July 2.","summary":"Paramount Global nominates three board directors as Skydance merger awaits approval  TradingView","url":"https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L3N3S51CC:0-paramount-global-nominates-three-board-directors-as-skydance-merger-awaits-approval/","image":"https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-02 23:03:17","author":"Shari Redstone","authors":["Shari Redstone"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.036}]}
