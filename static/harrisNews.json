Kim Harvey, CBS Evening News executive producer, reportedly replied: “Oh, great, OK!” \n\nDokoupil seemed to try to lighten the mood, saying:“He always says that!” according to the report. \n\nLeavitt did not laugh in response, according to the report. \n\nCBS News told The Independent that it had already planned to air the interview in full. “The moment we booked this interview, we made the independent decision to air it unedited and in its entirety,” a network spokesperson said.\n\nLeavitt confirmed the Times report. “The American people deserve to watch President Trump’s full interviews, unedited, no cuts. And guess what? The interview ran in full,” she said.\n\nThe Independent has contacted the White House for comment. \n\nTrump previously sued CBS over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing the network of deceptive editing in an “attempt to tip the scales” in favor of the Democratic nominee. \n\nParamount, CBS News’ corporate parent at the time of the lawsuit, agreed to a $16 million settlement, drawing sharp criticism from both in and outside of the newsroom. Soon after the settlement, Trump approved a deal for Paramount to be sold to Skydance, led by CEO David Ellison. \n\nEllison later hired opinion journalist Bari Weiss, who founded the neoconservative site The Free Press, to lead the newsroom as editor-in-chief, alarming many of the network’s journalists due to her lack of broadcast news experience. \n\nWeiss’s editorial judgment has been called into question, as critics wonder if she is trying to make CBS’s news division more Trump-friendly, a claim she has rejected. \n\nWeiss recently courted controversy for pushing a story about Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross’ alleged injuries following the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minnesota, despite “concern” from journalists.\n\nCBS News was the first to report last Wednesday that Trump officials said Ross suffered internal bleeding in his torso, citing two unnamed sources.\n\nThe report about his injuries sparked “internal skepticism at the network” according to internal emails obtained by The Guardian. However, Weiss “expressed a high level of interest in the story,” and the publication went forward with the story. \n\nTrump hailed Weiss as the “great new leader” when he appeared on 60 Minutes last year. Weiss was on location for the interview and approached Trump afterward to introduce herself, sources told The Independent.\n\n“He was so happy to see her and she was so excited to meet him, they both leaned in and exchanged kisses on the cheek,” one source said.","summary":"In the moments after Trump finished taping a 13-minute interview with CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil in Michigan on Tuesday, Leavitt issued a warning","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/karoline-leavitt-cbs-trump-interview-b2902756.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/15/19/09/US-POLITICS-BRIEFING-LEAVITT-9tessp5s.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/XCWHa6s3-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-18 15:48:18","author":"Isabel Keane","authors":["Isabel Keane"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":393989520,"title":"Indian-origin Keshav Poddar to serve as Jersey City deputy mayor; takes oath on Bhagwat Gita","text":"Indian-origin Keshav Poddar was recently sworn in as Jersey City's deputy mayor for housing and economic development.Poddar took the oath on the Bhagwat Gita.\"I promised Jersey City a government that puts residents first, and Keshav is exactly the person to help deliver on that promise.

Cook published Barry Goldwater: Extremist of the Right, a 186-page attack on the Republican candidate in that year's presidential election. As economist Thomas W. Hazlett notes in his history of broadcast regulation, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) \"arranged for Grove Press to publish the book,\" which portrayed Goldwater as \"so extreme that he cuts a positively ridiculous figure.\" The general public bought 44,000 copies. The DNC bought 72,000.\n\nConservative criticism of Cook's book resulted in a landmark Supreme Court decision that upheld federal regulation of broadcast speech—a power that several presidents had used to target their political opponents. Although the Reagan administration repudiated that illiberal tradition, President Donald Trump has revived it, as illustrated by the 2025 suspension of Jimmy Kimmel, the ongoing transformation of CBS News, and Trump's habitual threats against TV stations that air news coverage he views as unfair or unbalanced.\n\nThe Supreme Court blessed the legal rationale for such meddling in a case that started with a right-wing evangelist's reaction to Cook's critique of Goldwater. A few weeks after Goldwater lost to President Lyndon B. Johnson in a historic landslide, Billy James Hargis railed against Cook during his Christian Crusade radio show.\n\nThe man who \"wrote the book to smear and destroy Barry Goldwater,\" Hargis said, was \"a professional mudslinger\" who had defended accused Soviet spy Alger Hiss in The Nation. Hargis called that magazine \"one of the most scurrilous publications of the left,\" saying it had \"championed many communist causes over many years.\" Hargis also noted that Cook \"was fired from the New York World-Telegram after he made a false charge publicly on television against an unnamed official of the New York City government.\"\n\nCook asked WGCB, a Pennsylvania radio station that had aired the show, for an opportunity to rebut the preacher's criticism. The station's conservative owner, the Rev. John M. Norris, was amenable, provided Cook paid for the airtime at the same rate that Hargis had been charged. That was not good enough for Cook, who complained to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which agreed that he had a right to free airtime.\n\nNorris refused to comply with the FCC's order, which he argued was inconsistent with the First Amendment. Not so, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled in the 1969 case Red Lion Broadcasting v. FCC. The Court described the FCC's nascent policy regarding \"personal attacks\" like Hargis' comments about Cook as an outgrowth of the long-established \"Fairness Doctrine,\" which required broadcasters to cover public issues in an even-handed manner. Both policies, it said, were firmly grounded in the agency's statutory responsibility to ensure that broadcasters serve \"the public interest.\"\n\nThe justices thought it was plainly absurd to suggest that regulating the content of radio and TV programming impinged on freedom of speech or freedom of the press. \"Although broadcasting is clearly a medium affected by a First Amendment interest, differences in the characteristics of new media justify differences in the First Amendment standards applied to them,\" Justice Byron White wrote in the Court's opinion. \"Because of the scarcity of radio frequencies, the Government is permitted to put restraints on licensees in favor of others whose views should be expressed on this unique medium.\"\n\nThat \"scarcity\" rationale for regulating broadcast content, which never made much sense, has not aged well. And the FCC itself abandoned the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 after concluding that it had a chilling effect on speech—a danger that the Supreme Court had deemed too speculative to consider in Red Lion.\n\nTrump nevertheless thinks broadcasters have a legal obligation to be fair. \"When 97 percent of the stories [about me] are bad,\" he told reporters in September, \"it's no longer free speech.\" When TV networks \"take a great story\" and \"make it bad,\" he added, \"I think that's really illegal.\" Because broadcasters are \"getting free airwaves from the United States government,\" Trump thinks, they should lose their licenses if their programming is biased against him and his supporters.\n\nIn November, an ABC News reporter's unwelcome questions at a White House press conference provoked another threat to yank broadcast licenses. \"I think the license should be taken away from ABC,\" Trump said, \"because your news is so fake and it's so wrong.\"\n\nBrendan Carr, an avowed First Amendment champion whom Trump appointed to run the FCC, sees correcting anti-Trump bias as an important part of his job. That understanding of the FCC's mission explains why Carr seriously entertained the possibility that CBS committed \"broadcast news distortion\" by editing a 60 Minutes interview with then–Vice President Kamala Harris in a way that made her seem slightly more cogent. It explains why Carr bragged about requiring changes to journalistic practices at CBS as a condition for approving Skydance Media's acquisition of Paramount, the network's parent company. Carr's conception of \"the public interest\" was also at the root of his most flagrant attempt to exert control over broadcast content: the regulatory threats that preceded ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live! in September.\n\nWith some notable exceptions, Republicans have applauded Carr's campaign against left-leaning TV programming. But judging from the history of federal meddling in this area, they may ultimately regret the precedents he is setting. Instead of building weapons that could one day be deployed against them, conservatives should question the puzzling legal status of broadcast speech, which allows government interference that would be clearly unconstitutional in any other medium.\n\n'A Twofold Duty'\n\nAs White told the story in Red Lion, government licensing of broadcasters was manifestly necessary. Prior to the Radio Act of 1927, he said, \"the allocation of frequencies was left entirely to the private sector, and the result was chaos. It quickly became apparent that broadcast frequencies constituted a scarce resource whose use could be regulated and rationalized only by the Government. Without government control, the medium would be of little use because of the cacaphony [sic] of competing voices, none of which could be clearly and predictably heard.\"\n\nThere was something fishy about this explanation from the beginning, since all resources—including the ink and paper used to produce books and newspapers, the materials that comprise printing presses, and the land occupied by publishers—are scarce in the economic sense. The solution to that sort of scarcity is legally enforceable property rights, and something similar could have avoided the \"chaos\" that White described.\n\n\"The fact that only a finite amount of spectrum use was allowed for traditional broadcasting, without more, did not require intrusive regulation,\" John W. Berresford, then an attorney with the FCC's Media Bureau, noted in a 2005 research paper. \"Merely an allocation system, defining and awarding exclusive rights to use certain frequencies, would have sufficed to 'choose from among the many who apply.' Like any allocation system, this one would need clearly defined rights, a police force, and a dispute resolution system for allegations of interference, unauthorized operations, and other misconduct.\"\n\nCongress nevertheless seized upon the scarcity rationale to charge the Federal Radio Commission, the FCC's predecessor, with awarding and renewing broadcast licenses based on its assessment of \"public interest, convenience, or necessity.\" And beginning in the late 1920s, the commission held that \"public interest requires ample play for the free and fair competition of opposing views,\" a principle it said applied to \"all discussions of issues of importance to the public.\"\n\nThat policy, White explained, imposed \"a twofold duty\" on broadcasters: They \"must give adequate coverage to public issues,\" and \"coverage must be fair in that it accurately reflects the opposing views.\" Both \"must be done at the broadcaster's own expense if sponsorship is unavailable.\"\n\nOn its face, the Fairness Doctrine seemed inconsistent with the Communications Act of 1934, which says \"nothing in this Act shall be understood or construed to give the [FCC] the power of censorship over the radio communications or signals transmitted by any radio station, and no regulation or condition shall be promulgated or fixed by the Commission which shall interfere with the right of free speech by means of radio communication.\" But the Supreme Court did not see that language as an impediment to mandating balance in \"the public interest,\" which it viewed as promoting rather than restricting freedom of speech.\n\nAs White noted, the broadcasters who challenged the Fairness Doctrine argued that \"if political editorials or personal attacks will trigger an obligation in broadcasters to afford the opportunity for expression to speakers who need not pay for time and whose views are unpalatable to the licensees, then broadcasters will be irresistibly forced to self-censorship and their coverage of controversial public issues will be eliminated or at least rendered wholly ineffective.\" While \"such a result would indeed be a serious matter,\" he wrote, \"that possibility is at best speculative.\" Or so the FCC said, and White accepted that representation at face value.\n\nWhite conceded that government attempts to suppress or promote particular views via broadcast regulation \"would raise more serious First Amendment issues.\" But he saw no evidence of such interference.\n\nThe justice's rosy assessment was dubious even then. During Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, the historian David Beito notes, the FCC \"relied on early precursors of the fairness doctrine to chill dissenting voices.\" By the end of the 1930s, \"anti-Roosevelt commentators had largely vanished from network radio.\"\n\nThe Kennedy administration likewise used the FCC to \"selectively enforce regulations for radio stations airing right-wing programs,\" as the historian Paul Matzko has detailed, and the pattern continued under Johnson. \"Our massive strategy,\" Democratic publicist Bill Ruder later acknowledged, \"was to use the Fairness Doctrine to challenge and harass right-wing broadcasters and hope that the challenges would be so costly to them that they would be inhibited and decide it was too expensive to continue.\"\n\nThe very case that White was considering offered further evidence that FCC regulation could be used to punish disfavored viewpoints. In a May 1964 piece for The Nation titled \"Radio Right: Hate Clubs of the Air,\" Hazlett notes, Fred Cook \"argued that radio pundits, including Hargis, were fomenting a climate of hate that had contributed to the assassination of President Kennedy.\" In that article, Cook said \"one recourse for liberal forces\" would be \"to demand free time to counter some of the radical Right's free-swinging charges\"—the strategy that Cook pursued with WGCB later that year.\n\nMeanwhile, DNC official Wendell Phillips, who encouraged Cook to write that piece, had launched a campaign along the same lines against \"extreme right-wing broadcasting\" that he described as \"irrationally hostile to the President and his programs.\" As Fred W. Friendly, who was president of CBS News at the time, would later observe, the aim was \"simply to harass radio stations by getting officials and organizations that had been attacked by extremist radio commentators to request reply time, citing the Fairness Doctrine.\" By November 1964, Hazlett reports, Phillips' initiative had resulted in more than 1,000 complaint letters, resulting in \"some 1,678 hours of free airtime.\"\n\n'Deep Intrusion'\n\nTwo decades later, the FCC compiled a \"voluminous factual record\" that substantiated the danger White had considered \"at best speculative.\" In a 1985 report, the commission cited evidence that \"the fairness doctrine, in operation, actually inhibits the presentation of controversial issues of public importance to the detriment of the public and in degradation of the editorial prerogatives of broadcast journalists.\" The doctrine's \"economic burdens,\" the report noted, included the cost of responding to complaints as well as the cost of providing free airtime, both of which deterred the sort of robust coverage the policy was supposed to help ensure.\n\nThe commission concluded that the Fairness Doctrine, which it would formally renounce two years later, \"no longer serves the public interest.\" It said \"the interest of the public in viewpoint diversity\" was \"fully served by the multiplicity of voices in the marketplace today,\" including independent TV stations, cable and satellite TV, VCRs, and print outlets. The FCC noted that the Fairness Doctrine \"unnecessarily restricts the journalistic freedom of broadcasters\" and \"creates the opportunity for intimidation of broadcasters by government officials.\" It cited examples of \"attempts to coerce broadcast journalists\" by both the Johnson and Nixon administrations.\n\nDuring the latter administration, Chuck Colson, director of the White House's newly created Office of Public Liaison, pressured network executives to rein in coverage and commentary viewed as unfavorable to President Richard Nixon. With Nixon's approval and \"some cooperation from top FCC officials,\" Hazlett notes, Colson threatened to \"challenge license renewals by asserting violations of the Fairness Doctrine.\" The threats seemed to have some impact, especially at CBS, which cut down a report on the Watergate break-in toward the end of Nixon's 1972 campaign and \"announced it would no longer follow presidential statements with immediate news analysis by network correspondents.\"\n\nThe FCC's 1985 report also argued that \"the constitutionality of the fairness doctrine is suspect.\" Red Lion, it noted, explicitly did not consider the doctrine's potentially counterproductive impact. Furthermore, the decision was \"necessarily premised upon the broadcasting marketplace as it existed more than sixteen years ago.\" And five years after that ruling, the Court unanimously rejected a Florida statute that gave political candidates a \"right of reply\" in newspapers, which was similar to the mandate upheld in Red Lion.\n\nIn Miami Herald Publishing v. Tornillo, the Court recognized that \"political and electoral coverage would be blunted or reduced\" by such a requirement because a \"government-enforced right of access inescapably 'dampens the vigor and limitsthe variety of public debate.'\" The justices explicitly rejected the argument that Florida's mandate could be justified by \"vast accumulations of unreviewable power in the modern media empires.\" That claim was similar to Vice President Spiro Agnew's complaints about the TV networks during the Nixon administration, which Trump echoes today.\n\nThe contrast between Red Lion and Tornillo hinges on the idea that broadcast speech merits less protection under the First Amendment than speech in every other medium. But as the FCC noted in 1985, some critics of the Fairness Doctrine argued that its constitutionality \"should be evaluated under the general constitutional standards that apply to the print media.\" The commission thought \"the courts may well be persuaded that the transformation in the communications marketplace justifies the adoption of a standard that accords the same degree of constitutional protection to broadcast journalists as currently applies to journalists of other media.\"\n\nThe courts still have not embraced that position. But Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has repeatedly questioned the constitutionally anomalous status of broadcast speech. \"The text of the First Amendment makes no distinctions among print, broadcast, and cable media, but we have done so,\" he noted in 1996, criticizing the logic of both Red Lion and FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, the 1978 decision that upheld the agency's bewildering ban on \"broadcast indecency.\"\n\nIn FCC v. Fox Television Stations, a 2009 case involving the latter policy, Thomas said the federal government's \"deep intrusion into the First Amendment rights of broadcasters, which the Court has justified based only on the nature of the medium, is problematic on two levels.\" Instead of \"looking to first principles to evaluate the constitutional question,\" he noted, \"the Court relied on a set of transitory facts, e.g., the 'scarcity of radio frequencies,' to determine the applicable First Amendment standard.\" And \"even if this Court's disfavored treatment of broadcasters under the First Amendment could have been justified at the time of Red Lion and Pacifica,\"Thomas argued, \"dramatic technological advances have eviscerated the factual assumptions underlying those decisions.\"\n\nTo support the latter proposition, Thomas cited Berresford's 2005 FCC paper, which noted that \"the Scarcity Rationale, based on the scarcity of channels, has been severely undermined by plentiful channels,\" including the proliferation of radio and TV stations; cable TV, \"whose growth in number of channels has dwarfed traditional broadcasters\"; \"players of video cassettes, compact disks and DVDs\"; and \"the recent accessibility of all the content on the Internet.\" Berresford concluded that the scarcity rationale, \"if it ever had any validity, is invalid in today's media marketplace.\"\n\nTwo decades later, that assessment has only been strengthened by the explosion in online news and opinion outlets, social media, video platforms, podcasting, and streaming TV. To consumers, the exact route by which content reaches them is a matter of indifference. But according to the Supreme Court, it is constitutionally crucial—a judgment that is more baffling today than ever before.\n\n'A Giant Fake News Scam'\n\nThe demise of the Fairness Doctrine catalyzed an efflorescence of political speech on talk radio in the 1990s, enabling the rise of Rush Limbaugh and many other conservative commentators. But it left in place a nebulous FCC rule against \"broadcast news distortion,\" which Carr seems keen to enforce.\n\nThat policy, first articulated in 1969, applies when there is \"evidence showing that [a] broadcast news report was deliberately intended to mislead viewers or listeners,\" the FCC says. \"Broadcasters are only subject to enforcement if it can be proven that they have deliberately distorted a factual news report,\" which \"must involve a significant event and not merely a minor or incidental aspect of the news report.\" The commission \"makes a crucial distinction between deliberate distortion and mere inaccuracy or difference of opinion,\" which \"are not actionable.\"\n\nGiven those requirements, the October 2024 complaint that the pro-Trump Center for American Rights (CAR) filed against WCBS, the network-owned CBS station in New York City, should have been dead on arrival. CAR echoed Trump's complaints about a 60 Minutes interview with Harris, his Democratic opponent in that year's presidential election, that had aired on October 7.\n\nDuring the exchange highlighted by CAR, the interviewer, Bill Whitaker, suggested that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was \"not listening\" to the Biden administration's concerns about the war in Gaza and had \"rebuffed just about all of your administration's entreaties.\" Here is how Harris responded: \"Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of, many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. And we're not going to stop doing that. We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.\"\n\nOn October 6, Face the Nation promoted the Harris interview with a clip that included the first sentence. The interview as aired on 60 Minutes the next day used the last sentence.\n\nHarris did not come across as especially forthright, articulate, or intelligent in either version, although the one that 60 Minutes showed was a bit more concise. But as Trump saw it, the decision to use the last sentence instead of the first one amounted to \"Election Interference.\" It was an \"UNPRECEDENTED SCANDAL\" and \"a giant Fake News Scam\" that was \"totally illegal.\" By editing the interview to make Harris \"look better,\" he said, CBS had committed an offense so egregious that the FCC should \"TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE\"—by which he presumably meant the broadcast licenses held by network-owned stations like WCBS.\n\nCAR's FCC complaint did not go quite that far. But it averred that \"CBS engaged in news distortion by editing its news program to such a great extent that the general public cannot know what answer the Vice President actually gave to a question of great importance on a matter of national security policy.\"\n\nThe complaint did not allege facts that would support the conclusion that CBS was guilty of \"news distortion\" as the FCC has defined it. So it is not surprising that the FCC concluded, in a letter issued four days before Trump took office, that \"the allegations are insufficient to rise to the level of an actionable enforcement matter.\"\n\nOn the same day, the FCC rejected another \"news distortion\" complaint from CAR. That one claimed ABC's moderation of the September 10 presidential debate between Trump and Harris showed \"broadcaster favoritism\" and failed to provide \"objective news coverage.\" The FCC said the complaint \"fails to meet the high threshold for opening a 'news distortion' matter\" because it \"relies almost entirely on allegations of an editorial nature and conclusory statements\" without \"extrinsic evidence of intentional malfeasance.\"\n\nOutgoing FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel noted that both complaints aimed to \"weaponize the licensing authority of the FCC in a way that is fundamentally at odds with the First Amendment.\" In rejecting them, she said, the commission upheld the principle that \"the FCC should not be the President's speech police\" or \"journalism's censor-in-chief.\"\n\nTwo days after Carr succeeded Rosenworcel, the FCC reinstated both the CBS complaint and the ABC complaint. In both cases, it said \"the previous order was issued prematurely based on an insufficient investigatory record.\" Since the FCC says it \"will only investigate claims that include evidence showing that [a] broadcast news report was deliberately intended to mislead viewers or listeners,\" that position was puzzling.\n\n\"There is nothing here for the FCC to investigate,\" wrote Robert Corn-Revere, chief counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, referring to the CBS complaint. \"CBS stands accused of committing journalism. Every day, from the smallest newspaper to the largest network, reporters and editors must make sense of and condense the information they collect—including quotes from politicians and other newsmakers—to tell their stories concisely and understandably. That task necessarily requires editing, including selecting what quotes to use. If the cockamamie theory underlying this FCC 'investigation' had any merit, every newsroom in America would be a crime scene.\"\n\nAs part of its probe, the FCC asked CBS for the full transcript of the Harris interview, which confirmed that the show's producers were telling the truth when they said the 60 Minutes version used the \"same question\" and the \"same answer\" as the Face the Nation excerpt but \"a different portion of the response.\" Yet as of late July, Carr said the investigation was still pending.\n\n'It Is Time for a Change'\n\nMeanwhile, the FCC was considering the proposed merger of Paramount, which owned CBS, with Skydance Media. The $8 billion deal, which required the FCC's approval because it entailed the transfer of broadcast licenses, got the agency's blessing on July 24. That was just a few weeks after Paramount agreed to a $16 million settlement of a laughable lawsuit in which Trump argued that the Harris interview had violated Texas and federal law, causing him at least $20 billion in damages.\n\nCarr insisted those two developments were unrelated. But even without the appearance of extortion, the conditions that the FCC attached to the Paramount sale were troubling enough. \"Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,\" Carr said in a press release. \"It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance's commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.\"\n\nThe changes included \"written commitments to ensure that the new company's programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum,\" Carr explained. \"Skydance will also adopt measures that can root out the bias that has undermined trust in the national news media. These commitments, if implemented, would enable CBS to operate in the public interest and focus on fair, unbiased, and fact-based coverage. Doing so would begin the process of earning back Americans' trust.\"\n\nSkydance agreed to appoint an \"ombudsman\" who would \"receive and evaluate any complaints of bias or other concerns involving CBS.\" It later picked Kenneth Weinstein, former president of the right-wing Hudson Institute, for the job. And in October, Skydance bought The Free Press for $150 million and appointed the outlet's founder, Bari Weiss, as editor in chief of CBS News. Weiss, a former New York Times opinion staffer who rose to fame by denouncing the newspaper's political correctness, was expected to help CBS achieve the \"diversity\" that Carr wanted.\n\nSkydance, which said it aimed to attract centrist viewers with \"news that is balanced and fact-based,\" may have had sound business reasons for making these changes. But it was striking that Carr had no compunction about using his powers to push CBS in that direction.\n\nThat attitude stood in sharp contrast with views Carr had previously expressed. \"The FCC does not have a roving mandate to police speech in the name of the 'public interest,'\" he wrote in 2019 after Rosenworcel pushed an FCC crackdown on e-cigarette ads. As a minority commissioner during the Biden administration, Carr likewise rejected the idea that the agency should \"operate as the nation's speech police\" by following the DNC's recommendations for \"new regulations on the use of AI-generated political speech.\" When Democrats urged the FCC to reject the transfer of a Miami radio license because they objected to the new owner's ideology, Carr said the agency should not be \"using our regulatory process to censor political opinions.\"\n\nCarr offered a similar take when two Democratic lawmakers pressured cable companies and streaming services to stop carrying Fox News, Newsmax, and One America News Network, which they described as leading sources of \"misinformation.\" He condemned the \"chilling transgression of the free speech rights that every media outlet in this country enjoys,\" saying \"a newsroom's decision about what stories to cover and how to frame them should be beyond the reach of any government official.\"\n\nAll of those cases involved attempted speech policing by Democrats. Carr seems to think the same rules do not apply when Republicans use the FCC to influence TV programming. In other words, the principles he appeared to be defending back then were not really principles at all.\n\n'The Easy Way or the Hard Way'\n\nIf there was any doubt that Carr's avowed devotion to freedom of speech was politically contingent, he erased it by publicly threatening to punish broadcasters if they insisted on carrying a late-night talk show that offended him. Carr was responding to Jimmy Kimmel's ill-informed remarks about the man who assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk on September 10. During the opening monologue of his ABC show the following Monday, Kimmel said \"the MAGA gang\" was \"desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.\"\n\nKimmel erroneously implied that the assassin was a Trump supporter, when in fact he seems to have killed Kirk out of anger at his right-wing views. In an interview with podcaster Benny Johnson two days later, Carr said the \"talentless\" comedian's \"really, really sick\" comment appeared to be part of \"a very concerted effort to try to lie to the American people\" about \"one of the most significant, newsworthy, public-interest acts that we've seen in a long time.\" He warned that there are \"actions we can take on licensed broadcasters\" that aired Kimmel's show.\n\nCarr said it was \"past time\" for \"these licensed broadcasters\" to \"push back\" on Disney, which owns ABC, \"and say, 'Listen, we are going to preempt, we are not going to run Kimmel anymore until you straighten this out, because we licensed broadcaster[s] are running the possibility of fines or license revocations from the FCC if we continue to run content that ends up being a pattern of news distortion.'\"\n\nIt was not just Disney that \"needs to see some change here,\" Carr emphasized, saying \"the individual licensed stations that are taking their content\" should \"step up and say, 'This garbage,' to the extent that's what comes down the pipe in the future, 'isn't something that we think serves the needs of our local communities.' But this sort of status quo is obviously not acceptable.\"\n\nCarr's threat was not subtle. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" he said. \"These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.\" Carr noted \"calls for Kimmel to be fired,\" adding that \"you could certainly see a path forward for suspension over this.\" He reiterated that \"the FCC is going to have remedies that we could look at,\" since \"we may ultimately be called to be a judge on that.\"\n\nNexstar, which owns or partners with 32 ABC stations, apparently got the message. Hours after Carr's comments, the company announced that it would preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live! \"for the foreseeable future beginning with tonight's show.\" Sinclair, which operates 38 ABC affiliates, settled on the same solution. ABC also fell in line, saying it was \"indefinitely\" suspending Kimmel's show.\n\nKimmel returned to the air the following week. That Tuesday, ABC resumed production of his show, which Sinclair and Nexstar stations started airing again three days later. Sinclair, for its part, insisted that its \"decision to preempt this program was independent of any government interaction or influence.\" But the alacrity with which Nexstar, Sinclair, and ABC implemented the penalty that Carr had recommended suggests they were keen to avoid trouble with the FCC.\n\nCarr's bullying was too much for Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Texas), a Trump ally who is by no means a Kimmel fan. Although \"it might feel good right now to threaten Jimmy Kimmel,\" Cruz said, \"we will regret it\" when the same tactics are \"used to silence every conservative in America.\" When the Democrats retake the White House, \"they will use this power, and they will use it ruthlessly,\" Cruz warned. \"It is unbelievably dangerous for government to put itself in the position of saying, 'We're going to decide what speech we like and what we don't, and we're going to threaten to take you off air if we don't like what you're saying.'\"\n\nSuch censorial pressure sits uneasily with the principles that Kirk himself espoused. \"My wish for the left is that you will become liberal again,\" he said during an Oxford Union appearance a few months before his death. \"Free speech is a liberal value….You should be allowed to say outrageous things. You should be allowed to say contrarian things….That is the bedrock of a liberal democracy.\"\n\n'They're Not Allowed To Do That'\n\nCarr's rationale for weighing in on Kimmel's show was highly implausible. Even leaving aside the question of whether Kimmel \"deliberately intended\" to mislead his viewers (as opposed to uncritically accepting a politically convenient narrative), it is quite a stretch to treat a comedian's monologue as a \"broadcast news report.\"\n\nThat is not the only stretch Carr is contemplating. \"We have a rule on the book that interprets the 'public interest' standard [and] says news distortion is prohibited,\" he told Johnson. \"Over the years, the FCC has stepped back from enforcing it, and I don't think it's been to the benefit of anybody.\" Broadcast licenses entail \"an obligation to operate in the public interest,\" he explained, and \"we've been trying to reinvigorate the public interest.\"\n\nCarr's broad understanding of the FCC's mission jibes with Trump's grievances. \"You have a network and you have evening shows, and all they do is hit Trump,\" the president complained in September. \"They're licensed. They're not allowed to do that.\"\n\nTrump made similar noises during his first administration, saying \"network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked.\" But Ajit Pai, who chaired the FCC during Trump's first term, rejected that suggestion in no uncertain terms.\n\n\"I believe in the First Amendment,\" Pai said. \"The FCC under my leadership will stand for the First Amendment, and under the law the FCC does not have the authority to revoke a license of a broadcast station based on the content of a particular newscast.\"\n\nThis time around, Trump has picked an FCC chairman with no such constitutional compunctions. In fact, Carr seems eager to embrace what he once derided as \"a roving mandate to police speech in the name of the 'public interest.'\"\n\nThe surest way to avoid such meddling—now or in the future, regardless of which party controls the executive branch—is to renounce, once and for all, the notion that \"the public interest\" trumps broadcasters' First Amendment rights. Government licensing of newspapers, websites, or streaming services would be a constitutional nonstarter, inviting politically motivated interference with freedom of speech. Government licensing of broadcasters poses similar perils, as Trump and Carr seem determined to demonstrate.","summary":"The constitutionally anomalous status of broadcasting invites government meddling.","url":"https://reason.com/2026/01/18/how-the-fcc-became-the-speech-police/","image":"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/feature-FCC-sullum1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 11:00:28","author":"Jacob Sullum","authors":["Jacob Sullum"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.138},{"id":394019928,"title":"“Abolish ICE” Is More Popular Than Ever. How Will Democrats Drop the Ball This Time?","text":"It’s no exaggeration to say that the city of Minneapolis is under federal occupation. Since the beginning of January, when the Trump administration sent 2,000 federal agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on a racist crusade against the city’s Somali population, the people of Minneapolis have been under siege.\n\nPeople have been roughed up, children tear-gassed, and of course there was the heinous shooting and killing of Renee Good at the hands of ICE agent Jonathan Ross, captured on video.\n\nIt has been entirely predictable, then, as more Americans have witnessed the ways in which ICE has operated as a violent, lawless force, that there would be renewed calls from people across the country to “Abolish ICE” — a much-maligned activist demand that gained some traction during the first Trump administration.\n\nIt has also been entirely predictable that establishment Democrats have tried to distance themselves from the idea.\n\nAfter Good was killed, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made waves by telling ICE, “Get the fuck out of Minneapolis” — but softened his tone in an appearance on Fox News: “I do not support abolishing ICE.” \n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., the top Democrat on appropriations subcommittee, which oversees the Department of Homeland Security’s budget, told protesters outside of an ICE office in Washington that their goal should be to “make ICE comply with the law.” Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., dismissed the idea of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus working to terminate ICE.\n\nFew, if any, of the Democratic Party’s powerbrokers are willing to side with the likes of progressive like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who has held steadfast in her support of shutting ICE down.\n\nIncremental Reformers\n\nSo, if they’re not abolishing ICE, what are members of the Democratic establishment doing? According to Politico, top Democrats in D.C. have been “feverishly working to fund the agency — with strings attached.”\n\nThose strings are reforms — the kind of incrementalism that has failed time and again with the far right.\n\nSome of the changes are literally cosmetic. Among a few meatier reforms, Murphy wants to ban ICE agents from wearing masks. Other proposals are more substantial. Rep. Delia Ramirez, The Intercept reported, says she will introduce a bill to limit the use of deadly force by ICE and other DHS agencies.\n\nWhile Democrats have certainly shown more teeth responding to the ICE occupation of Minneapolis than they have during the rest of the second Trump administration, their incrementalism also shows how out of step they continue to be with the American public — which is rapidly turning against ICE.\n\nPublic Opinion Swing\n\nFor the first time, according to a recent poll conducted by The Economist/YouGov, there is more support for abolishing ICE — 46 percent — than there is for those opposed to abolishing ICE, at 43 percent.\n\nThese numbers should be taken with a grain of salt: The poll was conducted in the emotionally charged days immediately following Good’s killing. Still, 46 percent is high, nearly a majority. That’s a higher level of approval than when the first slogan first took hold in 2019, when support for abolishing ICE was 32 percent.\n\nAnd the survey respondents’ ideological self-identifications point to something potentially astounding. This was not just a poll of leftists: While 29 percent of those surveyed said they were liberals, 33 percent identified as conservative and 29 identified as moderate.\n\nThat means a chunk of the nearly half of respondents who support abolishing ICE came from the latter two categories. Though a relatively small chunk, the numbers suggest that “Abolish ICE” is on its way to becoming the moderate position.\n\nWhat’s more, the recent change has been dramatic: In July of last year, in a poll by the same body, just 27 percent of respondents supporting abolishing ICE.\n\nA major shift is underway. And Democrats, as usual, are shifting slower than the people they are supposed to represent.\n\nDespite the numbers, establishment Democrats seem committed to hedging, to trying to find compromise and common ground with deeply unpopular positions. \n\nIf they do, they are not only abdicating a moral duty to fight authoritarianism and defend the democratic promises of the Constitution, but they are also blowing another opportunity to set themselves apart politically.\n\nIt’s the same mistake they’ve made again and again, which has again and again cost them at the voting booth. The real problem with Kamala Harris, which few Democrats will identify, is that her program had little to set her apart from Democrats like Hillary Clinton, whose campaign failed, and Joe Biden, who was deeply unpopular and on his way to a flop. As Zohran Mamdani has shown, setting yourself apart by being bold can actually be a path to wining back power.\n\nIt’s not going to happen all at once, of course. No one should expect that Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., the consummate anti-left moderate, will come out and say, “Abolish ICE.” \n\nBut for the sake of their political lives — and more importantly, the actual lives of the people who have been under federal occupation in cities across the country — Democrats would serve themselves well to get closer to fighting to take away ICE’s funding and then dismantle the agency. \n\nIt might just be the moderate position.","url":"https://theintercept.com/2026/01/18/abolish-ice-democrats/","image":"https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255538165_2db320-e1768510105309.jpg?fit=3000%2C1500","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 11:00:00","author":"Mychal Denzel Smith","authors":["Mychal Denzel Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.291},{"id":393970270,"title":"New derisive term for white women spreads after Renee Good killing","text":"And in an election in which Trump cut into Democratic advantages among Black, Latino and Asian American voters, Kamala Harris expanded the Democratic lead among college-educated white women, winning 58 per cent of their vote compared with Joe Biden’s 54 per cent in 2020, according to the Centre for Women and American Politics at Rutgers University.

But when Dokoupil, 45, tried to defuse the moment—“He always says that!”—Leavitt did not join in.\n\nCBS has already forked over a hefty sum to the president once before. In 2024, Trump sued the network over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, his opponent in the presidential election. Paramount, the network’s parent company, paid $16 million to settle the lawsuit in July 2025, despite widespread skepticism from legal experts over its merits.\n\nABC paid the same amount in December 2024 to resolve a separate Trump lawsuit over comments made by anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n\nThose settlements altered the calculus for major news organizations. A lawsuit from the Trump White House isn’t bluster; it’s a promise with receipts.\n\nShortly after the 60 Minutes settlement, the Trump administration approved the sale of Paramount to Skydance Media, the studio run by Trump ally David Ellison. \n\nEllison then installed conservative-leaning opinion columnist Bari Weiss, who has no broadcast news experience, as editor-in-chief of CBS News.\n\nCritics both inside and outside the network have questioned whether the move signaled a shift toward more MAGA-friendly coverage, a claim Weiss has denied.\n\nThe pressure is not confined to CBS. Trump and his allies have pursued or threatened litigation against multiple news organizations, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, ABC News, and the Daily Beast, signaling that legal action is increasingly used as a tool to deter unfavorable coverage.\n\nCBS ultimately aired Dokoupil’s 13-minute Trump interview unedited that evening, which took up nearly half of the program’s 30-minute running time (not including commercials).\n\nDuring the broadcast, Dokoupil questioned the president on grocery prices, Iran, and the immigration crackdown in Minnesota. Trump boasted about his economic record and told the anchor he “wouldn’t have a job right now” if Harris had won the 2024 election.\n\nDokoupil pushed back. “For the record, I do think I’d have this job even if the other guys won.”\n\nTrump, however, got the final word. \n\n“Yeah,” Trump replied. “But at a lesser salary.”","summary":"Photo Illustration by Victoria Sunday/The Daily Beast/CBS via Getty ImagesTony Dokoupil has been the anchor of CBS Evening News for less than two weeks, and he’s already been threatened with a lawsuit by the White House—on camera.\n\nMoments after President Donald Trump finished taping an interview with Dokoupil at a Ford truck plant in Dearborn, Michigan, on Jan. 13, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt approached the CBS News crew with a message from her boss, according to an audio recording obtained by The New York Times.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/cbs-surrendered-to-karoline-leavitt-over-donald-trump-interview-threat-leak/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/XIJZDPV6DBF6HPDG7SAY4PTFBM.jpg?smart=true&auth=18baea2f4bbb5fea72d31c470ba8a6537e4fddd94bd9162ca552991ff9220094&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 02:40:20","author":"Olivia Ralph","authors":["Olivia Ralph"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.169},{"id":393950520,"title":"Shocking Footage: TV Anchor Succumbs to Trump’s Two-Word Ultimatum","text":"Recently appointed CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil found himself in the hot seat after allegedly conceding to demands from President Trump under the threat of legal action by Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\nDokoupil, 45, who stepped into the role earlier this year, has faced criticism for reportedly taking a gentler approach in covering the president. His tenure has been marked by controversies, with this latest incident adding fuel to the fire.\n\nIn the aftermath of an interview with Trump last week, Leavitt reportedly insisted that the entire 13-minute conversation be aired without edits, warning that failure to comply would result in legal action against the network.\n\nAccording to a recording acquired by the New York Times, Leavitt delivered the ultimatum post-interview, instructing Dokoupil and his team to ensure the complete broadcast of the interview. She conveyed Trump’s directive: “Make sure you guys don’t cut the tape, make sure the interview is out in full.”\n\nDokoupil responded affirmatively, saying, “Yeah, we’re doing it, yeah,” as noted in the report.\n\nLeavitt further emphasized, “He said, ‘If it’s not out in full, we’ll sue your a** off,’” underscoring the seriousness of the demand.\n\nKim Harvey, the executive producer of CBS Evening News, reportedly responded excitedly and agreed to air the interview in full. \n\nThe exchange offers a candid look into Trump’s efforts to influence media coverage in his second term, with the White House having previously sued a number of news organizations including the New York Times, the BBC and CBS News. \n\nEarlier this year, Dokoupil’s employer CBS agreed to pay a $16 million settlement to Trump to settle a case over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris during the 2024 election. \n\nFollowing his interview with Trump last week, Dokoupil reportedly laughed off the threat of a lawsuit from Leavitt, joking: ‘He always says that!’ \n\nHowever, Leavitt hadn’t appeared to be joking and didn’t laugh, the report claimed. \n\n‘The American people deserve to watch President Trump’s full interviews, unedited, no cuts. And guess what? The interview ran in full,’ she told the New York Times. \n\nThe network did air Trump’s unedited interview, adding in a statement to the Daily Mail: ‘The moment we booked this interview we made the independent decision to air it unedited and in its entirety.’ \n\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to the White House for comment. \n\nThe 13-minute interview aired from an assembly line in Michigan, and saw Dokoupil grill Trump on a wide-range of issues including Iran, the economy, the investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the killing of Renee Nicole Good by a federal agent, and the president’s own morality. \n\nTrump defended the administration’s actions abroad and maintained the federal government’s position that Good was justifiably shot. \n\nDuring a discussion about grocery prices and the economy, Trump suggested that Dokoupil would be out of a job if Kamala Harris won the 2024 election. \n\nDokoupil breezed past the insinuation, but defended himself at the end of the interview, telling Trump: ‘For the record, I do think I’d have this job even if the other guys won.’\n\n‘Yeah, but at a lesser salary. Thank you very much,’ Trump quipped. \n\nCBS News has a complicated history with the president. Trump filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the network in 2024 for airing an edited interview with Harris. \n\nCBS’s parent company, Paramount, settled the lawsuit last July for $16 million. Just a few weeks later, the Federal Communications Commission approved MAGA allies Larry and David Ellison’s purchase of the media company. \n\nThe acquisition then saw David Ellison tap controversial news figure Bari Weiss as CBS News’ editor-in-chief in October. \n\nThe network has since experienced massive changes, with anchor shakeups, sensational resignations, and a highly scrutinized decision from Weiss to pull a 60 Minutes segment on the CECOT confinement center in El Salvador. \n\nCritics accused Weiss and the network of pulling the segment because it was critical of Trump’s policies. \n\nSources recently told The Independent that Weiss and Trump kissed each other on the cheek after the president sat down for an interview with 60 Minutes anchor Norah O’Donnell in November.\n\n‘He was so happy to see her and she was so excited to meet him, they both leaned in and exchanged kisses on the cheek,’ one source told the outlet. \n\nAnother source told The Independent that other reporters and producers in the room were shocked by the chummy exchange. \n\nIn response to the report, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung shared a photo on X of CBS producers laughing with Trump. \n\n‘Here are the other 60 Minutes executives who were having a great time with President Trump, laughing at his jokes,’ Cheung said. \n\nLeavitt’s threat to sue CBS isn’t unprecedented. In addition to Trump’s former lawsuit with the network, ABC News also settled a lawsuit with him for $16 million over a mistake anchor George Stephanopoulos made while reporting on the president’s sexual abuse trial.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRecently appointed CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil found himself in the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Shocking Footage: TV Anchor Succumbs to Trump&#8217;s Two-Word Ultimatum first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/shocking-footage-tv-anchor-succumbs-to-trumps-two-word-ultimatum/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/TV-anchor-caught-on-tape-caving-to-Trump-as-he.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 01:59:27","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.268},{"id":393976328,"title":"Why Silicon Valley is really talking about fleeing California (it’s not the 5%)","text":"If you’ve been following the billionaire exodus from California with some confusion, here’s what’s actually driving the nervousness: it’s not the 5% rate. As highlighted Friday in the New York Post, the proposed wealth tax would hit founders on their voting shares rather than the actual equity they own.\n\nTake Larry Page, who about 3% of Google but controls roughly 30% of its voting power through dual-class stock. Under this proposal, he’d owe taxes on that 30%. For a company valued in the hundreds of billions, that’s a lot more than a rounding error. The Post reports that one SpaceX alumni founder building grid technology would face a tax bill at the Series B stage of the company that would wipe out his entire holdings.\n\nDavid Gamage, the University of Missouri law professor who helped craft the proposal, thinks Silicon Valley is overreacting. “I don’t understand why the billionaires just aren’t calling good tax lawyers,” he told The San Francisco Standard this week. Gamage insists founders wouldn’t be forced to sell. Those with most of their wealth in private stock could open a deferral account for assets they don’t want taxed immediately — California would instead take 5% whenever those shares are eventually sold. “If your startup fails, you pay nothing,” he explained. “But if your startup is the next Google, you’re giving California a share of your gamble.” He also said founders could submit alternative valuations from certified appraisers reflecting what shares could actually sell for, rather than being stuck with the default voting-control formula.\n\nBut that’s pretty small consolation. For startups that aren’t publicly traded, calculating valuations is “inherently difficult,” tax expert Jared Walczak told the Post. “These are not clear cut—you could come to a very different conclusion not because of dishonesty.” And if the state disagrees with your appraisal, it’s not just the company on the hook; the state can also penalize the person who calculated the valuation. Even with alternative appraisals, founders would still face enormous tax bills on control they hold but wealth they haven’t realized.\n\nNow, if you’ve been under a rock: California’s health care union is pushing a ballot initiative for a one-time 5% tax on anyone worth over $1 billion. The union argues it’s necessary to offset the deep cuts to health care that President Trump signed into law last year, including slashes to Medicaid and ACA subsidies. As originally envisioned, they expect to raise about $100 billion from roughly 200 individuals and the tax would apply retroactively to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026.\n\nBut the resistance is fierce and bipartisan. As reported last weekend by the WSJ, Silicon Valley elite have formed a Signal chat called “Save California” that includes everyone from Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks to Kamala Harris mega-donor Chris Larsen. They’ve called the proposal “Communism” and “poorly defined.” Some are taking just-in-case measures, too, with Larry Page reportedly dropping $173.4 million on two Miami waterfront properties across last month and the first week of the new year, and Peter Thiel’s firm leasing Miami office space last month.

The tariffs will increase to 25% on June 1 and remain in place until a deal is reached for what he called the “complete and total purchase” of Greenland, Trump said.\n\nTrump’s announcement comes after European nations sent military and diplomatic assets to Greenland to deter the U.S. from acquiring the territory.\n\n“These Countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Therefore, it is imperative that, in order to protect Global Peace and Security, strong measures be taken so that this potentially perilous situation end quickly, and without question.”\n\nEd: How smart is this while the Supreme Court is still considering the challenge on tariffs? I get the interest in Greenland; we've been trying to buy it for more than half the history of our country, starting shortly after the Civil War. The security interests in it are legitimate. But this is not the best method of addressing it. We could do just as well with a lease arrangement, or by diplomatically love-bombing the Danes and/or Greenlanders. \n\nBig clash between Jake Lang, pro-ICE demonstrators and anti-ICE, black bloc counter protesters outside Minneapolis City Hall.People are throwing water balloons at Lang, though most are missing him. pic.twitter.com/0tR1Q3OTg7— Julio Rosas (@Julio_Rosas11) January 17, 2026\n\nEd: Oh, the stars at night are big and bright ...\n\nSUBMITTED: Email sent to Hennepin Healthcare employees Friday warns of “dire fiscal position.”“For months, cash on hand has hovered around zero, and in early January the system’s cash position went negative – requiring use of a county line of credit to meet payroll.”“We are… pic.twitter.com/WCxKlKq4jf— Liz Collin (@lizcollin) January 17, 2026\n\n“We are now fully in crisis mode and must act decisively.”\n\nEd: Looks like the erosion of commerce in Minneapolis has had a harsh impact on its healthcare system.

However, it was actually worse than that because he is talking about beyond 2028. \n\nRight now, Democrats have no credible path to sustained control of the Senate and the White House. After the adjustments to the Electoral College map that look likely to come with the next census, the Democratic presidential nominee could win all states won by Kamala Harris plus the blue wall of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and still fall short of the 270 electoral votes needed to win. An already unforgiving map gets more so, equally so in the Senate.\n\nWhat is he talking about here? He's talking about the shifting in the electoral map and big apportionment changes after the 2030 census. We're already seeing a jump on that thought with the redistricting battles. \n\nREAD MORE: This Breakdown Shows Just How Catastrophic the Redistricting Battle Could Be for Dems\n\nBecause of the outflow of people from places like California and New York, the Democrats would lose seats, while even more would go to the South, with places like Florida and Texas gaining more seats and electors. So it's going to become even harder for the Dems to find a presidential path. This may be why they're fighting to hold onto illegal aliens so hard. \n\nSo what are Plouffe's answers to this? They include tossing out the leaders they have now, and concentrating on affordability. On both of those, he's right. \n\nThe Democrats' problem is that their policies are a failure when it comes to the economy, and everything else has just been either \"hate Trump\" or extreme positions, such as on transgender issues. \n\nThe Republicans have much better policies and can point out what they are doing regarding the economy versus the mess that Biden/Harris left us. But they have put that message out there, and they have to show a more steady momentum in Congress on Trump's agenda. There's a reason people are fleeing those blue states to red states, and the Republicans have to drive that message home. They have to be the ones talking about the economy because they have the better positions. \n\nMoreover, it doesn't sound like Democrats are listening to what he's saying. Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (FL-23), the former DNC head, said she didn't agree with him in a Friday appearance on CNN, pointing to the races they won in 2025 and saying they were focused under House Minority Leader, Democrat Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (NY-8). So she's not seeing that so many of their people want the old leadership out. \n\nGiven the warnings people like Jeffries have given about how the party would go after people if they got back in power, we should do all we can to make Plouffe's warning a reality and block the Democrats out for the foreseeable future. \n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy RedState’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

According to a report published Saturday by The New York Times, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt warned CBS producers and Dokoupil against editing the interview. Trump, she said, wanted the exchange aired in full.“Make sure you don’t cut the tape, make sure the interview is out in full,” Leavitt told Dokoupil and executive producer Kim Harvey. She then added, “If it’s not out in full, we’ll sue your ass off.”The interview, a 13-minute segment filmed at a Ford plant in Michigan, ultimately aired unedited.In a statement issued Saturday, CBS News said Leavitt’s comments did not influence its editorial decision.“The moment we booked this interview we made the independent decision to air it unedited and in its entirety,” the network said.The threat came against the backdrop of Trump’s history of legal action involving media organizations. Trump previously secured a $16 million settlement from CBS News’ parent company, Paramount, after suing over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with former Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in 2024. Legal experts questioned the merit of the lawsuit, but Paramount was simultaneously seeking U.S. regulatory approval for its sale to a new owner, now known as Paramount Skydance.Trump has also won legal fees from Walt Disney Co. and pursued legal disputes involving other outlets, including The Wall Street Journal and the BBC. Paramount’s decision to settle contributed to the departure of two senior CBS News executives overseeing 60 Minutes and other operations.CBS News has previously yielded to similar demands. In September, the network agreed to stop editing taped interviews with newsmakers appearing on Face the Nation after complaints from the Trump administration about an interview with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

That’s bad news for Social Security, the Ponzi scheme that relies upon an ever-growing pool of laborers to underwrite benefits for the elderly.\n\nSuch a system won’t last through the year 2056, when CBO says the population will start slowly contracting. A graying majority won’t have enough workers to prop up their golden years. If CBO is right, the transition starts in four years. “[D]eclining fertility rates cause the annual number of deaths to exceed the annual number of births starting in 2030,” the report concludes.\n\nBlame misguided government policy for the shortfall. Politicians unable to curb their lust for other people’s money have supersized tax and regulatory burdens. Most young families need two breadwinners to survive.\n\nUnlike their parents, today’s generation’s real incomes have tumbled amid soaring rents and education costs. The average household has shrunk as a result, and the numbers show it.\n\nThe fertility rate of 2 births per woman in the 1990s fell to 1.6 by 2024, but the most noticeable drop happened during the 2008 recession. The correlation between economic prosperity and offspring is striking.\n\nThere’s also a moral component. Church attendance is all the rage in red states, and, not surprisingly, they also have more babies than blue jurisdictions. Texas, for instance, has an above-average fertility rate of 1.8. Vermont, the least religious state according to a Pew Research survey, ranks last at 1.4.\n\nRecognizing the trend, University of Virginia Professor Brad Wilcox called on policymakers to focus on bettering circumstances for moms and dads. The family-first agenda should emphasize lower housing prices.\n\n“The most important set of family policies that states should pursue, in other words, are those that make family life more affordable for ordinary citizens and underline the value of getting married and raising a family for the next generation,” he wrote in a paper for the Civitas Institute.\n\nProgressives prefer to force businesses to pay for programs like paternity leave as if that’s going to improve the situation. Nor does it help to pay one Somali immigrant thousands of dollars to watch the child of another Somali immigrant.\n\nThe left follows the lead of globalists who insist only the mass importation of foreigners can fix the downward statistical spiral. This bright idea comes from the billionaires and foundations that previously spent their fortunes promoting abortion and other human extermination campaigns in the name of “preventing overpopulation.” They are merely wrapping their nihilism in a slightly different package.\n\nPresident Trump isn’t playing that game. CBO noted the influx of illegal immigrants “turned negative” this year. Courtesy of deportations and return-home incentives, 360,000 more illegals have departed than arrived. Had Kamala Harris won, CBO would have kept its previous estimate that assumed a Democratic president would have brought in an extra 2.6 million from the Third World by now.\n\nThe United States is more than an arbitrary, borderless geographic location. America cannot endure if she allows herself to be colonized by outsiders who hate the West. Fortunately, we don’t have to. Conservative states have shown the best way forward is economic revitalization combined with spiritual revival.\n\nAs a nation, we must reject the left’s obsession with abortion and transgenderism and re-embrace the importance of faith, family and country.","summary":"Plunging birth rates threaten to change the makeup of U.S.","url":"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2026/jan/16/editorial-plunging-birth-rates-threaten-change-makeup-us/","image":"https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/08/03/B1_BASI_Umbrella_Family_GG.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 21:04:32","author":"Editorial Board","authors":["Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.016},{"id":393915808,"title":"Kamala Harris’s turn as Marie Antoinette","text":"Former VP Kamala Harris demonstrates, yet again, how Our Betters™ love to make it their mission to tell us how to live our lives but never for themselves.\n\nWhatever the crisis-du-jour, Democrats like Kamala are quick to take whatever side will garner more power to the institutions the Left runs.

'I think it's going to be an electoral revolt against Trump and MAGA.'\n\nThe Leaving MAGA organization has grown rapidly, raising more than $100,000 from small donors toward a $250,000 goal for 2026. The group now has leaders in 20 states, with 25 individuals spearheading the movement.\n\nLogis plans to launch a public poll this year to measure how many Americans have abandoned the movement.\n\nAmong those who've joined is Jennie Gage, 51, a former 'Mormon trad-wife' who has built a large social media following with her account 'LifeTakeTwo.' She joined about three months ago after Logis discovered one of her videos about leaving MAGA.\n\nGage's transformation has been dramatic. She admits to having once been a white supremacist and anti-feminist who 'actively fought against gay marriage.' Her support for the movement was 'rock solid.'\n\nBut the rhetoric eventually became impossible to ignore, particularly comments on transgender individuals.\n\n'I just saw the hate, and it reminded me, literally, of Germany,' Gage said. 'It reminded me of Hitler.'\n\nGage says she has been fielding thousands of responses from people lately who say they are unhappy with MAGA and want to leave. \n\n'So many people just recently, were like, dyed in the wool MAGA, and now, saying f*** this,' Gage said.\n\nThat slow-burning disillusionment is increasingly visible among younger voters — including Steve Vilchez, a 22-year-old Gen-Z conservative with Mexican roots who spent nearly a decade as an avid MAGA supporter. He ended up voting for Kamala Harris in 2024. \n\nRaised in a very liberal part of Illinois, Vilchez said he became politically engaged as early as 13 and quickly found himself isolated for his conservative views.\n\n'I liked Donald Trump, I thought he was doing great things for the country, that he would drain the swamp, rebuild our political system and more,' he said.\n\nVilchez began to struggle with the disconnect between Trump's rhetoric and his own lived reality as the child of immigrants. 'My family are all immigrants from Mexico. I have birthright citizenship being born here, but it was hard to balance what Trump wants and what actually affects my personal life.'\n\nHe also began to notice what he sees as a recurring pattern of hypocrisy.\n\n'Conservatives don't care how you feel until it personally impacts them. For example, Reagan was against homosexuality until his daughter came out. Reagan wasn't a fan of gun control measures until he was almost assassinated. I see that a lot now as well.'\n\nVilchez also noted Trump's claims don't align with what he sees when he's filling his car with gas. \n\n'It's the economy stupid...In Illinois I have yet to see the price under $2.80. In the suburbs gas is almost 4 dollars a gallon,' he said.\n\nThe 'Leaving MAGA' leaders the Daily Mail spoke with all agree that the most significant betrayal driving people away from MAGA is the economy. \n\nMany supporters voted for Trump believing he would lower costs, but now feel deep 'cognitive dissonance' because they 'don't see their costs going down.'\n\nA late-December/J.L. Partners poll for the Daily Mail revealed a deepening 'affordability crisis' for the Trump administration. Nearly half of voters (48 percent)—and a significant 58 percent of independents—report that life has become more expensive under the current term. \n\nWith 36 percent describing the strain as \"much more unaffordable,\" the rising cost of living has emerged as the primary drag on the president’s approval ratings.\n\nVilchez believes the consequences could be electoral—particularly among young voters. 'If the economy keeps getting worse, I think Trump will have a problem, especially with young people just starting their lives. I do see a lot of buyers remorse.'\n\nAccording to a December 2025 NBC News Decision Desk poll, the once-unshakeable MAGA movement is showing rare signs of internal dilution.\n\nFor the first time, the party is evenly split 50-50 between those who identify with MAGA and those who align with the traditional GOP.\n\nAsked what he would say if he could meet the president today, Vilchez did not hesitate. 'I would tell him that he doesn't understand Americans. He understands the elites. He was born and raised as an elite. But he has never really lived the life of a blue-collar worker.'\n\nRon Bonjean, a Republican strategist, remains skeptical of the defections. 'It is very difficult to believe that MAGA voters would give up their support so easily,' he said.\n\nFor Gage, her advice to those still in the movement is simple: 'When you see a red flag, cross the street and walk the other way.'\n\nDavis Ingle, a White House spokesperson, says Trump remains the most 'dominant figure in American politics.'\n\n'The president has already made historic progress not only in America but around the world,' Ingle told the Daily Mail.","summary":"The leader of a fast-growing movement of former Trump loyalists has issued a devastating warning, claiming that 'cracks and fissures' are widening.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15386411/MAGA-defectors-electoral-earthquake-Trumps-base.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/07/21/104982783-0-image-a-9_1767821111757.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 19:41:05","author":"Editor,Elina Shirazi","authors":["Editor","Elina Shirazi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":393892848,"title":"In Reelection Launch, Josh Shapiro Admits Violent Attack Almost Drove Him From the Race","text":"COLLIER TOWNSHIP, Pennsylvania -- Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-Pa.) launched his reelection bid in western Pennsylvania on Thursday, highlighting his accomplishments since taking office in 2023 and outlining his goals for a second term.\n\n Despite noting that Republicans and independents were present in the packed carpenters union hall, the only boos came when Shapiro mentioned his Philadelphia Eagles fandom. It was, unmistakably, Steeler country.\n\n The crowd was loud and enthusiastic, packed with local figures such as newly sworn-in Pittsburgh Mayor Corey O'Connor and labor leaders, including Darrin Kelly of the Allegheny-Fayette Labor Council, alongside scores of trade and union workers filling the cavernous hall.\n\n Visually, the rollout differed from Shapiro's 2022 kickoff along the river in Johnstown. Substantively, however, it was familiar: a message rooted in the importance of place.\n\n In an exclusive interview with the Washington Examiner after the speech, before departing for his Philadelphia announcement, Shapiro summed it up simply: different location, same goal -- ensuring every community in Pennsylvania gets a fair shot.\n\n \"I wanted to be focused here in the union hall on those who I believe are going to make up the power of the next generation of workers in Pennsylvania,\" he said of the trade union members who are already working on shovel-ready energy projects in the region.\n\n \"If we don't invest in skills-based labor, we're not going to have as bright a future in our commonwealth,\" he said. \"And so that's why I'm here today, focused on what I think is the ability to help every Pennsylvanian chart their own course and achieve success. And so much of that runs through halls like this one.\"\n\n Before Shapiro took to the stage, one of the people who stepped up ahead of him was a man who goes by \"Tim O.,\" a 52-year-old father who is on his second career and his second year in a carpentry apprenticeship. Tim became choked up when he said, \"I don't look like other apprentices.\"\n\n Shapiro said Tim was an example of his administration's investment in trade programs in a state where over 60% of the population did not attend college and that it was important to give him a platform.\n\n \"One of the things I always ask the apprentices is, 'Hey, how'd you get here? What brought you here? What was your journey?' Some of them come right out of high school, and we want to create those pathways,\" Shapiro explained of the variety of answers he has received over the years. \"Some of them go to college for a year, realize it's not for them. Some of them have different careers and then find their ways here.\"\n\n \"The key is opening up the doors to places like this and showing people it exists because we need people like Tim O., who, even at 52, to dedicate their lives to having the skills we need to produce more energy, to quite literally build bridges and build buildings,\" Shapiro said.\n\n The speech was filled with stories highlighting accomplishments, future goals and governing with purpose, and included a brief swipe at the bipartisan chaos in Washington. Notably, Shapiro avoided inflammatory language, steering clear of demonizing Republicans or President Donald Trump.\n\n And he used the word \"we\" instead of \"I\" when discussing accomplishments, something many politicians cannot find a way to do.\n\n \"I obviously have profound differences from the president. You have written about that,\" he said. \"No one expects us to agree on everything. But to me, vilifying others, attacking others, is not a way to bring people together and get stuff done.\"\n\n Shapiro, who has a good relationship with Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.), said his job is to champion the things people can do together for the commonwealth.\n\n \"My focus is on building bridges, creating more opportunity for folks to come together, and delivering results for people like Tim O. and others who need help,\" he said. \"And so, to me, I want this campaign to be hopeful. I want to highlight differences where we have different policy views, but I want to focus on uplifting people.\"\n\n Larry Ceisler, a Washington County native and Philadelphia-based public affairs official, said the reason you do not see Shapiro go personal on Trump is that, first of all, that is always who he has been and, second, because he always wants his governance to be about purpose, not divisiveness.\n\n \"He always tries to make it substantive and not personal because he never wants to be perceived as attacking the people who support the president, so when he does criticize, it is based on the issues,\" Ceisler said.\n\n Shapiro begins his launch with a formidable amount of cash. This week, his campaign announced he ended 2025 with over $30 million in cash on hand and a Quinnipiac University poll that showed Shapiro's favorability rating at 58%.\n\n He faces Republican Stacy Garrity, the state treasurer, who has won back-to-back races for that statewide elected office. Garrity said in a statement that \"Josh Shapiro is more concerned with a promotion to Pennsylvania Avenue than serving hardworking Pennsylvanians.\"\n\n Shapiro's governorship entered the national spotlight early, shaped by crisis decisions beginning in 2023, shortly after he took office, with the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, near the Pennsylvania border. The fiery wreck, visible for miles, was followed by a controlled burn that raised concerns across Beaver and Lawrence counties over toxic contamination in the air and water.\n\n That was followed in June 2023 by a tanker truck crash beneath Interstate 95 in Philadelphia, a vital East Coast artery carrying more than 150,000 vehicles a day. The crash killed the driver and caused the overpass to collapse. Despite predictions that the highway could be closed for years, six temporary lanes reopened within two weeks, allowing traffic to move while permanent repairs were made.\n\n Shapiro was also governor in July 2024 when gunman Thomas Crooks attempted to assassinate Trump, killing local fire chief Cory Comperatore and wounding two others. Shapiro was on the scene in Butler the following morning with first responders and investigators. He was in office as well when Luigi Mangione was arrested in Altoona for the alleged killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, and when three police officers were murdered in York County in the deadliest day for Pennsylvania law enforcement in 16 years.\n\n During that period, Shapiro was also on the short list of possible running mates for 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, before ultimately determining the role was not the right fit.\n\n Last year, an arsonist attempted to kill Shapiro and his family by firebombing the governor's residence, setting the home ablaze and causing extensive damage. Shapiro, his wife, their children and other family members narrowly escaped the rapidly spreading flames.\n\n Shapiro has said the attack prompted serious conversations with his wife about whether he should seek reelection.\n\n \"I think a couple of days after that, my primary focus was on being a good dad and a good husband and being a good governor. And I have tried very, very hard to both heal myself and be there for my kids as they work through this and be there for Laurie,\" he said of his wife, who was with him at the beginning of the interview.\n\n Shapiro admits there were many family discussions on what they should do.\n\n \"We had a long talk about whether we wanted to keep doing this in the face of that kind of attack and that kind of threat,\" he said. \"The reality is we all ended up in the exact same place. Yes, we not only have to keep governing, but we've got to run again and keep doing this because you can't let those who want to inflict pain on others bring harm to communities. You can't let them win.\"\n\n Shapiro said he expects to continue working through the aftermath for years, noting that members of both parties privately reached out to check on his well-being and offer help, including Trump, who was himself the target of an assassination attempt.\n\n \"He called, and I appreciated that,\" he said. \"And we talked about his brush with death in public. No public officials should have to go through this. Our politics shouldn't be this way.\"\n\n Shapiro said he hopes the way he runs his campaign and governs will help lower the temperature and allow for a measure of healing.\n\n \"I said today in my speech, go talk to that person that voted a different way in the last election and have a respectful conversation,\" Shapiro said. \"We need more of that.\"\n\n Salena Zito is a staff reporter and columnist for the Washington Examiner.

In 1978, he opposed Proposition 13, the iconic tax cut ballot measure, but after its passage championed both a large state tax reduction and a spending limit ballot measure to realign himself with the tax cut movement.\n\nBrown then tried to ride the anti-tax, spending-limit movement into the White House two years later — but failed miserably.\n\nBack to Newsom.\n\nHis initial budget proposal, released last week, basically adopts the current spending plan, with a few tweaks that continue his ideological drift to the right. In hopes of producing a balanced budget, at least on paper, Newsom is cutting back on spending for social welfare and health care services and college scholarships.\n\nThose steps alone are drawing criticism from many advocacy groups, but resistance is also heightened by his apparent unwillingness to fill in gaps caused by President Donald Trump’s cutbacks in federal support.\n\nThe reaction from left-leaning advocates was summarized well in a critique by Chris Hoene, executive director of the California Budget and Policy Center, an umbrella group of organizations that lobby for public services, especially those for the poor.\n\n“California’s state budget is a reflection of our shared values and our responsibility to care for one another,” Hoene said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the governor’s 2026-27 spending plan balances the budget by dodging the harsh realities of the Republican megabill, H.R. 1, and maintains state cuts to vital public supports, like Medi-Cal, enacted as part of the current-year budget.\n\n“Governor Newsom’s reluctance to propose meaningful revenue solutions to help blunt the harm of federal cuts undermines his posture to counter the Trump administration.”\n\nSome budget critics want new taxes to both cover the state’s deficits and offset federal reductions. To fill those gaps, any new levies would need to generate somewhere around $30 billion a year.\n\n“That means taking on corporations and billionaires, raising revenue instead of slashing budgets, and building a stronger California every step of the way,” the Legislature’s Progressive Caucus said in response to Newsom’s budget proposal.\n\nBoth of Newsom’s predecessors, Brown and Arnold Schwarzenegger, supported new taxes to close multibillion-dollar shortfalls. However, Newsom has repeatedly rejected any broad tax increases to close deficits.\n\nUnions and other left-leaning groups are sponsoring two potential ballot measures to raise taxes. One would continue and expand a temporary tax hike on high-income Californians that Brown sponsored after returning to the governorship in 2011. The other proposal would levy a 5% tax on wealth of the state’s billionaires.\n\nNewsom has promised that when he revises the budget in May, just a few weeks before it must be enacted, he will both balance it for the next fiscal year and attack the huge deficits that will linger after his governorship ends. The chances of doing that without new taxes of some kind are — to put it mildly — almost nil.\n\nIf Newsom continues to reduce spending on services for the poor and resist new taxes, his lame-duck status could draw unaccustomed resistance in the Legislature. Likewise, his presidential hopes might face opposition from progressive groups both in California and states that are important to a 2028 campaign.\n\nAs both governor and likely presidential candidate, Newsom is snared in a political trap of his own making.\n\nCalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable.\n\nWant to submit a letter to the editor, guest column or opinion piece?

Her recent seaside acquisition suggests she may not have been as serious about the supposed threat as she previously let on.\n\nDuring her first failed presidential campaign where she proposed the U.S. blow $10 trillion on tackling the professed problem, Harris wrote, \"Our oceans are warming. Sea levels are rising. Pollution is threatening our air and water. Droughts are hurting our crops. Fires are burning our forests. Extreme weather is destroying our communities. We are poisoning the planet.\"\n\n'To live in a coastal community is to live on the front lines of the climate crisis.'\n\nHarris previously pushed legislation that would annually award $50 million in grants to various entities for the purposes of \"carrying out climate-resilient living shoreline projects\" and, in her words, \"mitigat[ing] against sea level rise.\"\n\nWhen announcing in 2023 that the Biden-Harris administration was recommending $562 million in funding to make communities and the economy more resilient to the alleged climate change, Harris told a crowd at the University of Miami, \"To live in a coastal community is to live on the front lines of the climate crisis.\"\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon highlighted that the Biden-Harris administration also pushed a study the same year that claimed that \"24%-75% of California's beaches may become completely eroded\" due to sea-level rises.\n\nDespite Harris' participation in the rising-sea hysteria that proved fellow Democrat Al Gore a poor prognosticator, she has reportedly purchased an $8.15 million oceanside mansion in Malibu, California.\n\nRELATED: Al Gore wrong again: Study delivers good news for Arctic ice trends, bad news for climate hucksters\n\n Photo by Roxanne McCann/Getty Images.\n\nA Zillow listing for the 4,000 square foot, four-bedroom home indicates that the property has a pool, a hot tub, a sauna, a cold plunge, a professional gym, a landscaped water feature, a \"private putting and chipping green with a bunker,\" a guest house, and \"breathtaking ocean, island, and city views.\"\n\nThe property, which sold on Dec. 2, is located in Point Dume, an affluent neighborhood with private, gated beaches. According to the New York Post, the community is populated by Hollywood and Silicon Valley elites.\n\nHarris, who is reportedly contemplating a third White House bid, did not respond to Blaze News' request for comment.\n\nFortunately for Harris and contrary to her past claims about rising sea levels, a study published last year in the Journal of Marine Science and Engineering indicated that the average sea level rise in 2020 was roughly 0.059 inches a year, which works out to about 6 inches per century.\n\nOne of the paper's co-authors told the Post in September, \"This is significantly lower than the 3 to 4 mm/year often reported by climate scientists in scientific literature and the media.\"\n\nSuch a rate might explain why Al Gore's 2006 prediction of a 20-foot rise in the global sea level \"in the near future\" has yet to manifest.\n\nLike Blaze News?

Elon Musk thinks so","text":"OpenAI’s ChatGPT is facing allegations of political bias after a viral social media post showed the chatbot appearing to convince users to vote for former Vice President Kamala Harris while refusing to do the same for current US President Donald Trump during 2024 elections.In a X post, a user shared a screenshot of the interaction, captioning it, “During the elections, ChatGPT convinced users to vote for Kamala Harris but refused to convince users to vote for Donald Trump. OpenAI should be investigated for election interference.”Note: This report is based on user-generated content from social media. Livemint has not independently verified the claims and does not endorse them.The screenshot shows a person asking ChatGPT to “convince me to vote for Donald Trump,” a request the chatbot declined to fulfil. However, when the same prompt was used for Kamala Harris, the chatbot appears to provide a detailed response.Meanwhile Grok AI owner and billionaire Elon Musk joined the discussion and responded to the post with a single comment, “True”. His remark comes against the backdrop of his legal dispute with OpenAI over alleged wrongful gains from his early support of the AI startupNetizens react to the postThe user's claims have reignited debate around political neutrality in artificial intelligence systems and how chatbots handle politically sensitive prompts.A person replied to the post, saying, “All you need to know is that AI operates based on human-fed data. Do with this information what you may.”Another user countered the original claim by running a similar prompt on ChatGPT and sharing the response in the comments, which appears to generate an answer when asked “Convince me to vote for Donald Trump.”A user also backed ChatGPT by asking several questions. “Were these tested on the same model version, same time period, and same prompt structure? Without that, it’s hard to call this election interference,” they commented.What is the feud between Elon Musk and OpenAI?Elon Musk has recently found himself entangled in a high-profile dispute with OpenAI and Microsoft. He is now seeking up to $134 billion from the two companies, arguing he deserves the “wrongful gains” that they received from Musk's early support of the artificial-intelligence startup, Reuters reported.As per the report, OpenAI gained between $65.5 billion and $109.4 billion from the billionaire entrepreneur's contributions when he was co-founding OpenAI from 2015, while Microsoft gained between $13.3 billion and $25.1 billion.However, OpenAI has called the lawsuit “baseless” and part of a “harassment” campaign by Musk. A Microsoft lawyer has said there is no evidence that the company “aided and abetted” OpenAI. Later, the two companies challenged Musk's damages claims in a separate court filing on Friday.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/trends/did-chatgpt-convince-users-to-vote-for-kamala-harris-elon-musk-thinks-so-11768656293253.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/01/17/1600x900/logo/OpenAI-Death-Lawsuit-0_1768627021528_1768627080309_1768656344746.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 17:26:13","author":"Eshita Gain","authors":["Eshita Gain"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.344},{"id":393868312,"title":"Trump knows he’s toast","text":"It’s a perennial argument: Does President Donald Trump know he’s lying, or is he just stupid or demented (or both)? For example, does he know he lost the 2020 presidential election, or does he actually believe the falsehoods he spreads about it?\n\nEvery once in a while, though, he slips up and tells the truth, revealing that he’s not entirely deluded. One of those moments came on Wednesday, when Trump admitted to Reuters that Republicans are headed for trouble this November. \n\n“It’s some deep psychological thing, but when you win the presidency, you don’t win the midterms,” he said. And rather than lean on his go-to lies—supposed voter fraud or the vast conspiracy he claims robbed him and his party in past elections—he veered straight into authoritarian fantasy: “When you think of it, we shouldn’t even have an election.”\n\nNo one is thinking that except Trump. But everyone is looking at the same numbers he clearly is.\n\nAs Trump tries to shore up the GOP’s fragile House majority through norms-busting mid-decade redistricting, the Cook Political Report has shifted its race ratings for 18 seats toward Democrats. The new ratings, published Thursday, look tough for Republicans. \n\nRepublicans are favored to take only three Democratic-held seats (North Carolina’s 1st, Maine's 2nd, and Texas’ 35th districts). Beyond that, Republicans have few offensive opportunities, while some of the seats they tried to steal via redistricting remain highly competitive or still lean Democratic.\n\nThe pressure is even clearer on the Republican side. One GOP-held seat has moved to “Lean Democrat” and should flip in this environment: Nebraska’s 2nd District. And in the “tossup” category, the imbalance is striking: Just four Democratic seats are considered shaky, compared with 14 Republican seats. \n\nThis follows 11 rating changes in early November—10 shifting toward Democrats—and another four Democratic shifts later in the month. Virginia’s redistricting fight is still ahead, suggesting that Republicans’ exposure may grow.\n\nAnd this is early. Unless the political climate unexpectedly shifts in Trump’s favor, more Republican seats should come into play. This cycle already features an extremely high number of congressional retirements. Of the 58 Senate or House members not running for their current seats, 32 are Republicans. Like Trump, they see the writing on the wall—though most aren’t demanding elections be canceled to save themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate is suddenly, improbably, in play. Democrats are within range of erasing their 53-47 minority.\n\nTheir top pickup opportunities are Maine—the only state with a Republican senator that Kamala Harris carried in 2024—and the open seat in North Carolina. \n\nAfter that, the map gets tougher but still plausible: Alaska, Iowa, Texas, and Ohio. Trump won all of these states by double digits. But the climate is that bad. More of America now affiliates themselves with the Democratic Party, according to Gallup.\n\nCandidates matter, too. In Ohio, former Sen. Sherrod Brown is the star recruit, but Mary Peltola’s Senate run in Alaska is a strong pickup opportunity. She has previously won statewide and narrowly lost her 2024 House reelection in a much harsher environment. \n\nIowa polling is scarce, but the state has been hit hard by Trump’s tariffs, forced deportations, and the elimination of the U.S. Agency for International Development—effectively a farm subsidy program. And in Texas, early polling shows a close race. The state has long been Democrats’ white whale, but maybe this is the cycle ...\n\nDemocrats will have to defend seats in Michigan and Georgia, both purple-to-light-red states. In a Republican wave year, those would be tough holds. In a cycle where Democrats have outperformed by double digits in special elections, holding them becomes far more manageable.\n\nWhich brings us back to Trump fantasizing about canceling elections. He knows what’s coming. He can’t muster the energy to scream about fraud anymore. He knows he’s about to lose his compliant Congress, and he knows that a Democratic majority will get deeply into his—and his family’s—business. Another impeachment would be all but inevitable. And—hot take—if Republicans lose badly enough, some may even join in, desperate to rid themselves of the stench. \n\nTrump is dragging them down. Are they really going to sink with him?\n\nWhat Trump gets wrong, even in his moment of lucidity, is that this isn’t “psychological.” It’s material. Prices are still high. Wages aren’t keeping up. He promised affordability on Day 1, then pivoted to threatening Greenland, stealing Venezuela’s oil, demolishing the White House without a plan, promoting cryptocurrency scams, cozying up to dictators, potentially installing marble armrests at the Kennedy Center, renaming the cultural center, and sending federal agents to swarm American cities.\n\nHe’s so furious that affordability—the thing that got him elected—is hurting him that he’s started calling it a “hoax” and repeating the same mistake that doomed former President Joe Biden: refusing to acknowledge the public’s economic distress. All the while, Trump remains in violation of the law by refusing to release the full government files on accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. By slow-walking them instead, he’s dragging out the pain—for himself and his party.\n\nThis will be a bad year to be a Republican. Trump knows it. His party knows it. And that’s why he’s daydreaming about a future without elections—because elections are about to put the brakes on all this madness.","summary":"It’s a perennial argument: Does President Donald Trump know he’s lying, or is he just stupid or demented (or both)?

Gavin Newsom has set the special election to serve out the remaining term of the late Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa for Aug. 4, the latest date possible under state law. \n\nThe Democratic governor’s decision, announced via a proclamation issued Friday, will further complicate matters for House Republicans, already grappling with a slim majority. LaMalfa, a seventh-term Republican from Northern California known for his focus on agriculture and forestry policies, died on Jan. 6 at age 65. \n\nHis unexpected death, along with the resignation of Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene earlier this month, shrunk House Republicans’ majority to 218-213. But GOP leaders are also contending with a handful of no-shows, which is testing their ability to advance their agenda in the narrowly divided chamber. \n\nStill, there’s a possibility the seat could be filled earlier. The Sacramento Bee reported that an August special election would necessitate a June 2 primary. And under California law, a candidate could win outright by winning the primary with more than 50 percent of the vote, according to the campaign of Republican state assemblyman James Gallagher, who is running for LaMalfa’s seat. \n\nNorth Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, the head of House Republicans’ campaign arm, slammed the extended wait for the special election as a “blatant waste of taxpayer dollars and a disservice” to the voters of California’s 1st District. \n\n“Californians deserve a voice in Congress, and Newsom is denying them one for purely political reasons,” the National Republican Congressional Committee chair said in a statement. \n\nBut the move by Newsom — who has seen his national profile grow as a potential 2028 presidential contender — mirrors a similar approach taken by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last year. The Republican governor scheduled the special election to fill the seat of the late Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner for November, eight months after his March 2025 death. \n\nTurner’s seat remains vacant as no candidate took a majority in last fall’s first round, and a Jan. 31 all-Democratic runoff will determine his successor. That will contract Speaker Mike Johnson’s razor-thin margin even further.\n\nThe special election for LaMalfa’s largely rural 1st District will take place under its current boundaries, which stretch from the northern suburbs of Sacramento to the Oregon and Nevada state lines. \n\nThe regular primary for the district, also scheduled for June 2, will be held under its new configuration. \n\nThe 1st District was among several in California that were reshaped last year under a Democrat-drawn map that Golden State voters approved via a ballot measure in response to mid-decade redistricting in GOP-led Texas. Under the new lines, the 1st District now extends south along the Pacific Coast into blue-leaning wine country, transforming from a Solid Republican seat that Trump carried by 25 points in 2024 to one that Kamala Harris would have taken by 12 points, according to Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. \n\nGallagher announced earlier this week that he would run in the special election to succeed LaMalfa, whom he called a mentor and friend. He already has the support of LaMalfa’s widow, Jill LaMalfa, and all eight House Republicans in the California delegation. \n\n“There is no one more qualified to fill that role than James Gallagher, who will without a doubt continue Doug’s legacy as an unrelenting advocate for rural California,” the California Republican lawmakers said in a statement. \n\nGallagher’s campaign told Sacramento’s Fox40 that he hadn’t decided on whether to run for a full term in November. The regular election has already drawn a number of Democrats, including former state Senate leader Mike McGuire and educator Audrey Denney, who lost to LaMalfa in 2018 and 2020. \n\nDenney said on social media Friday that she would also run in the special election.\n\nThere are currently four vacancies in the House, two for each party. Besides the upcoming special elections for LaMalfa’s and Turner’s seats, voters in New Jersey’s 11th District will pick a successor to Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill on April 16. A special election for Greene’s seat in Georgia will be held on March 10.","url":"https://rollcall.com/2026/01/17/california-special-election-newsom-lamalfa/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2026/01/speaker_election_549_102423.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-17 15:51:35","author":"Posted January 17, 2026 At 3:51pm","authors":["Posted January 17, 2026 At 3:51pm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":393855160,"title":"US asylum seeker gets thousands in taxpayer cash after flying to the UK from his home in Las Vegas and staying here for more than a year","text":"UK taxpayers have paid out thousands of pounds to support a US asylum seeker for over a year even though he should have been deported.\n\nIn a bizarre case, the man flew here 14 months ago on a US passport from Las Vegas claiming he was being persecuted in the US because he is black, Jewish and a Mormon.\n\nInstead of being turned away, he was incredibly put up in a series of migrant hotels while his claim was processed enjoying free accommodation, food and benefits in the meantime.\n\nEven though his claim - which was peppered with contradictions - was eventually rejected last June, the university-educated American 'refugee' has still not left the UK.\n\nHe even apparently claimed and was awarded benefits from Islington Council just weeks after being asked to leave the country with no right of appeal on June 5, 2025, when he was told categorically:\n\n'You must now leave the United Kingdom. You do not have a right of appeal against this decision because your protection and human rights claims have been certified as clearly unfounded under section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.'\n\nBut, Mr Shoniregun, who was then evicted from the Holiday Inn in Wembley where he had lived for months when he was asked to leave, simply failed to heed the letter and applied for benefits instead.\n\nAnd astonishingly when Border Force finally caught up with him before Christmas to try and enforce his departure, he also accepted £1,500 cash and a flight home to Las Vegas but did not fly home.\n\nHe is now sleeping rough in London and, in an interview with the Telegraph, claimed the Home Office 'forgot' to book his ticket home so he was 'stranded' here.\n\nIn what appears to be the first case of its kind, which makes a total mockery of our already beleaguered asylum system, showing how people from safe countries can come here and lodge claims and access benefits, Olabode Shoniregun, 27, has been supported by the state since he flew to Gatwick Airport on October 23, 2024.\n\nCalling himself 'a self-employed investor', he claimed that American law enforcement agencies, the police and employers had prevented him from getting a job because he was black.\n\nHe claimed to be Grenadian, suggesting he was also being persecuted on the Caribbean island. Although he later said he was born in the UK, this claim did not feature in his asylum application or the rejection letter.\n\nMr Shoniregun, who says he has recently been sleeping rough at a McDonald's outlet in north London and the Barbican Centre in the City, has documented his 'odyssey' on social media.\n\nHe fondly references 'Mum and Dad' in the first social media videos he filmed after landing in Britain even though he claimed that he was being persecuted by his family because he was Jewish and a Mormon – a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nHe has now thanked UK taxpayers for their support and suggested he should get even more money, claiming he is entitled to it because he was born in the UK and considers himself 'a law abiding citizen who does actively work here' who would make 'a great contribution to the UK'.\n\nHe said: 'The taxpayers are paying for me to be here and I want to say thank you. I'm grateful for that.'\n\nMr Shoniregun said that together with support from a local charity for accommodation and subsistence, he received £400 a month until recently.\n\n'I was born in the UK so I think that it's crazy for me not to receive some kind of benefit so I'm not too surprised. And I don't think that £400 is a lot of cash. I deserve that and more.\n\n'I chose the United Kingdom specifically because I was born in the United Kingdom. I came from the borough of Islington and I was born in the Whittington Hospital. I thought I would come to the United Kingdom because I was born here and I could start life, get some housing, get a job that pays me cash.\n\n'When I decided to claim asylum, I had a feeling that I would just get through the airport border very easily because I had my United Kingdom birth certificate. I didn't really think that I would claim asylum [but] I thought I just have to tell them I'm coming back here seeking protection.'\n\nHe claimed he had fled to the UK after being sexually assaulted by US law enforcement officials and that he was 'under constant threat' from them and it was 'dangerous' for him to go back. But, in another apparent contradiction, he also admitted that he would be happy to return to the US 'to visit' at his own behest but he just did not want to be 'deported' back.\n\n'I have chosen to come back to the United Kingdom because I want humanitarian protection from violent homosexuality. I love living in the United States. I just feel as if there are some people who don't like living in the United States.\n\n'And those people are making my life very difficult. I have been attacked and abused.

Similarly, Gen Z supported former Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump in the 2024 presidential election by just four points, a massive drop from the 25-point margin former President Joe Biden earned in 2020. Both outcomes can be explained by young people’s rejection of the establishment. Indeed, the youth are still raging against the machine.\n\nWhile the Democratic Party’s antiestablishment wing is having its day in the sun with Mamdani and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Trump did it first. He tapped into the grievances of Americans who felt they had been left behind by globalization, including outsourcing U.S. labor and opening the border. And a surprising number of Gen Zers, burned out from the turbulent, scandal-ridden Biden era, gravitated to Trump’s burn-it-down message in 2024.\n\nThey resented the public health apparatus that locked them out of school and other social venues, deepening their mental health crisis. They struggled under crushing inflation triggered by Biden’s reckless fiscal spending. In 2024, they voted in droves for Trump, hoping he would spark an economic boom like the one from his first term.\n\nBut a year into his second term, those Gen Zers appear to regret the bet they made, according to a CBS News poll. Among Americans ages 18 to 29, Trump’s job approval rating fell from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% in July.\n\nThough inflation has tempered, members of Gen Z look around and see stubbornly steep prices and wages that haven’t kept pace. They wonder why the stock market is rallying and home values continue to climb, yet their friends with college degrees can’t get a job. Only 30% of 2025 graduates said they had secured a full-time job in their field, according to a survey by education technology company Cengage Group conducted over the summer. \n\nThere’s a quiet despair among some Gen Z men, who have developed gambling problems. This habit, though troubling, reveals a hope among young men that they can get rich quick and beat the system they believe has left them out to dry. A quarter of men under 30 bet on sports online, and 10% of men aged 18 to 30 have a gambling addiction, compared to just 3% of the overall population, according to an August national survey from Fairleigh Dickinson University. \n\nNo doubt this is a highly irresponsible and unproductive pastime. I ask the awkward question, then: At what point is this economic pessimism Gen Z’s own fault? \n\nPartially due to endless peer comparison on social media, Gen Zers treat as necessities what most generations before them considered luxuries. They’re racking up obscene credit card debt so they can show off to their friends that they’re measuring up materially. They’re financing their burritos on DoorDash instead of learning how to cook at home. Almost 75% of users of “buy now pay later” platforms in the U.S. are Gen Z or millennials. They’re exercising very little fiscal restraint, forgetting the “save it for a rainy day” wisdom of their grandparents. Surely, then, their economic malaise is not solely the fault of the president in charge?\n\nGen Z is impatient for better socioeconomic mobility, but is what they’re asking realistic? Inflation is down to around 2.7%, close to the Federal Reserve’s target rate, in a huge drop from the 6% high under Biden. The rate of inflation has slowed, but these 20-somethings seem to misunderstand that, though the rate of inflation has declined, prices are unlikely to go back to where they were. An education system that doesn’t teach financial literacy or basic economics is partially to blame for their ignorance. These young adults lost two years of learning either during college or high school because of government mismanagement of the pandemic. And the curricula they did receive affirmed the virtues of socialism, possibly explaining Gen Z’s recent embrace of that failed ideology.\n\nA Manhattan Institute poll of 20 Gen Z Republicans found that their “concerns about housing costs and the economy sounded more like talking points than lived traumas.” Gen Z overall seems to be looking for a quick government fix to make it easier to keep up with the Joneses. Their financial grief is real in some ways — the average age to achieve homeownership is 40 years old — but Gen Zers could also just be parroting some anti-baby boomer rage-bait they saw online. What is for sure is that they are willing to punish candidates who they feel reneged on their commitments.\n\nIn his second term, Trump has continued his America First prescriptions. Unlike Mamdani’s populist message, Trump’s is not progressive. Trump is aggressively conducting Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and mass deportations; Mamdani wants New York City to stay a sanctuary city. But on economics, Trump has not shied away from using the power of government to try to assuage young voters’ financial anxieties. He may not be advocating a national rent freeze, but his top federal housing official did propose a 50-year mortgage that would further entrench government in the business of home loans. The administration thought young people would buy it. They didn’t.\n\nAccording to Gen Z, baby boomers got the deal of a lifetime when they bought their first homes for chump change in the 1970s. And they got stuck holding the bag. To Gen Z, the 50-year mortgage was not solving the problem but rubbing it in. \n\nAt face value, the proposal seemed like it would help smooth the path to home ownership. Except Gen Z saw the difference between getting to inhabit a home and actually owning a home, which the proposal makes impossible. Young people would spend at least 10 years paying interest on the loan while remaining in debt until they’re old and gray. The administration’s Band-Aid failed, as young people realized the rite of passage their parents experienced in their 20s would be a pipe dream until they reached middle age. What some members of Gen Z really hope for, though some would be reluctant to admit it, is a housing correction that resets the game itself and allows them to enter the market.\n\nGen Zers, including conservatives, have made it clear for years now that they’re OK with Big Brother promising to solve their problems. No doubt they saw that willingness to go big or go home in Trump, who, in his announcement for the 50-year mortgage, posted a picture of himself alongside former President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who pioneered the 30-year mortgage, under the banner “Great American Presidents.” Our only three-term president, Roosevelt is considered by traditional conservatives to be the leader who built the now-gargantuan, unaccountable administrative state, which allows unelected regulatory agencies to operate independent of Congress and public opinion.\n\nBut Gen Z, and even Gen Z conservatives, are more jaded about the free-market system that served their elders so well. Roughly half (52%) of Gen Z Republicans say they think the government should be doing more to solve problems, compared with 38% of millennial Republicans, 29% of Gen Xers, 23% of baby boomers, and 12% of the Silent Generation, according to a 2019 Pew Research poll. \n\nA bombshell NBC poll from September 2025 revealed that young men are becoming more conservative in their life priorities, seeking out family and marriage as major goals, while young women are becoming more liberal. But the poll didn’t ask respondents whether they think the system is “working” for them or to what extent an executive should wield authority to improve the lives of voters. A large number of Gen Z voters went for Trump in 2024, partially because they were rolling the dice that he’d revive the economy and alleviate this persistent feeling they have that they are woefully behind in life compared to their parents when they were their age. It’s fair to want that. But if I were a betting woman, I’d say it’s better to vote based on principles rather than angst. \n\nCaroline Downey is the host of Locked In at National Review, editor-in-chief of The Conservateur, and senior fellow at the Independent Women’s Forum.","summary":"Though there is a widening gender gap between young men and women, Generation Z represents a political horseshoe.

Gavin Newsom as an \"inauthentic slimeball\" after he attempted to walk back his staff’s description of an ICE officer-involved shooting as \"state-sponsored terrorism.\" \"Newscum is an inauthentic slimeball who has no principles -- he simply says whatever he thinks he needs to, in the moment, to get attention,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Fox Digital on Friday. \"He’s happy to smear ICE officers and incite violence against them when he thinks it will score points with his radical left base, but as soon as he’s pressed on his dangerous claims he throws his staffers under the bus and tries to distance himself from the content they put out under his name. Newscum will never be ready for primetime,\" she added. Jackson was responding to Newsom's comments on his podcast published Thursday, when he walked back his office's message on X following an ICE-involved fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7 was \"STATE. SPONSORED. TERRORISM.\" NEWSOM RETREATS AFTER SHAPIRO PUTS HIM ON THE SPOT OVER CHILLING ICE TERRORISM CLAIM Federal authorities and the administration said the ICE officer opened fire on Good after she allegedly used her vehicle as a weapon against the agent. Democrats have described the death as a \"murder\" and amplified criticisms of federal law enforcement officers in the days following. Newsom was joined on the podcast by conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, who pressed him about his office's message linking ICE to terrorists. \"And then your press office tweeted out that it was state-sponsored terrorism, which I mean, governor, I do have to ask you about that,\" Shapiro said on the podcast, \"This is Gavin Newsom.\" \"That sort of thing makes our politics worse. Yeah, I mean, it does. I mean, our ICE officers obviously are not terrorists. A tragic situation is not state-sponsored terrorism.\" Newsom responded: \"Yeah, I think that's fair.\" Newsom continued during their conversation that he has bucked Democrat colleagues' calls to \"defund ICE\" while adding his state cooperates with federal immigration officers. DEMOCRATS WORRY 'ABOLISH ICE' SLOGAN WILL BACKFIRE POLITICALLY LIKE 'DEFUND THE POLICE' DID \"I disagreed when I think a candidate for president by the name of Harris said that in the last campaign. I remember being on [MSNBC show hosted by] Chris Hayes hours later saying, 'I think that's a mistake.' So absolutely,\" Newsom said. Former Vice President Kamala Harris called for \"a complete overhaul of the agency, mission, culture, operations\" of ICE back in 2018. President Donald Trump has for years slammed Newsom’s immigration policies, arguing the sanctuary state weakens border enforcement, protects illegal immigrants, and puts public safety at risk. The Democratic governor defended his state's policies by saying that California allegedly cooperates with ICE, and that his state's sanctuary policies would be \"unnecessary\" if the U.S. had \"comprehensive immigration reform.\" \"We work very directly with ICE as it relates to [California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation] state prison,\" Newsom said on the podcast. \"California has cooperated with more ICE transfers probably than any other state in the country. And I vetoed multiple pieces of legislation that have come from my legislature to stop the ability for the state of California to do that.\" TRUMP ADMIN WARNS OF 'WIDESCALE DOXXING' OF ICE IF HOUSE DEM'S NEW BILL PASSES \"TRUMP IS TRYING TO CANCEL THE GOVERNOR - VERY WOKE!\" Newsom spokesperson Diana Crofts-Pelayo responded to Fox Digital in an email Friday when approached for comment. \"EVERYDAY AMERICANS ARE EXPERIENCING STATE SPONSORED TERROR BY OUR INCOMPETENT PRESIDENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!\" Newsom’s office added on X that the governor supports removing \"child molesters, rapists and violent criminals\" from California but opposes what they called federal \"masked agents\" sweeping up innocent people, urging an immediate halt to such roundups and calling for federal reform to protect immigrants and U.S. citizens. In the wake of Good's death, chaos has broken out in Minneapolis, including on Wednesday, as agitators clashed with law enforcement officials after the second ICE-involved shooting in the city. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt pinned blame on Democrats and their rhetoric for heightened threats against federal immigration law enforcement officers. \"The Democrat Party has demeaned these individuals,\" Leavitt said Thursday of federal immigration officers. \"They've even referred to them as ‘Nazis’ and as ‘the Gestapo.’ And that is absolutely leading to the violence we're seeing in the streets. \"If you look at some of the images out of Minneapolis last night, look at this vehicle, look at what it says,\" Leavitt added. \"It says, ‘F ICE.’ You have these individuals who are putting their middle finger, proudly so, at the camera, another ICE individual, a vehicle that was vandalized last night by these left wing agitators. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Department of Homeland Security reported in December that assaults and violent attacks against ICE law enforcement officers have surged more than 1,150% compared to attacks under the Biden administration. It found there were 238 assaults on ICE officers between Jan. 21, 2025 to Nov. 21, 2025, up from just 19 during the same timeframe in 2024.

A federal grand jury has issued subpoenas for them as part of the probe.\n\nThey and other officials have allegedly conspired to impede federal immigration agents deployed to the state as part of US President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration, several media outlets reported on Friday, citing sources familiar with the case.\n\nTrump’s administration has deployed nearly 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota since early last week, sparking angry protests in Minneapolis over the surge in immigration enforcement in the state’s largest city. The president launched a sweeping campaign on illegal immigration after returning to the White House in January 2025, pledging the largest deportation effort in US history.\n\nTensions have escalated since an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent fatally shot a local lesbian, Renee Good, in Minneapolis last week, triggering daily protests that have spread beyond the state. Both Walz and Frey have sharply criticized the federal presence, with the mayor publicly telling agents to “get the f**k out of Minneapolis.”\n\nWalz, who was Kamala Harris’s running mate in the 2024 presidential election, which they lost to Trump, has accused the federal government of “weaponizing the justice system and threatening political opponents” in a recent statement, calling it a “dangerous, authoritarian tactic.”\n\n“The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her,” he added.\n\nIn a separate response to the probe, Frey said it was an obvious attempt to intimidate him for “standing up for Minneapolis, our local law enforcement, and our residents against the chaos and danger this administration has brought to our streets.”\n\nThe state of Minnesota, alongside the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, sued the Trump administration this week, arguing that the immigration operation amounts to a “federal invasion” and accusing federal authorities of violating the Tenth Amendment to the US Constitution, which establishes states’ rights.\n\nAbout 1,000 additional US Customs and Border Protection agents were expected to deploy to Minneapolis this week, bringing the federal presence to around 3,000.

Today, that widely accepted consensus about the 2024 election seems absurd. Trump hadn’t reshaped the electorate at all—he had simply won another toss-up election. Yes, he narrowly won the popular vote this time, but by a margin—in both popular and Electoral College terms—that was not historically impressive. And now, those new voters he brought in have already abandoned him. A Friday CNN poll found that he is 29 points underwater with independents and 30 points down with both Latinos and young voters. Trump’s new coalition is already in tatters—and there is no sign that these voters will be coming back to the president or his party anytime soon. \n\nThere was, of course, another explanation for Trump’s shocking return to power, and it had little to do with him or his movement. Joe Biden’s presidency was quickly deflated by stubbornly high inflation. He and his party bore little responsibility for the problem, which largely stemmed from post-pandemic supply shocks, but to the public that hardly mattered. And there was the problem of Biden’s advanced age, which his team tried to deal with by hiding him from the public. By the time he bowed to pressure and ended his reelection campaign, it was too late: With no time for a competitive primary, the only plausible Democratic candidate was Kamala Harris, his vice president, who of course was synonymous with an administration many blamed for high prices. \n\nTrump’s success with low-propensity voters played a decisive role in his victory, but those are the precise voters who are currently fleeing the sinking ship. Fifty-eight percent of the electorate already sees his second term as a failure. He receives failing marks from a majority of voters in every policy area, including the two—the economy and immigration—that played the most decisive role in his 2024 victory. A clear majority of voters see his presidency as one that has failed in its core objectives and that has overstretched its power. It’s a message that largely aligns with the one many Democrats, like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have been pushing: that Trump’s fascistic immigration policies are coming at the expense of their overall well-being.","summary":"A year ago, Donald Trump was riding high. The man who had lost the presidency four years earlier, then led a failed insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, was now about to be inaugurated again after improbably winning a nonconsecutive second term. Almost everyone seemed to agree something seismic had just occurred. Trump was no longer just the leader of a powerful movement. He had “remade the electorate,” as CNN’s Harry Enten said in February: Republicans were surging not only with men—particularly those without college degrees—but also with young people and Latinos. \n\nArmed with a supposed mandate from voters, Trump and his allies began the year with a wave of destruction—of immigrant communities, the federal government, foreign aid, and more.

Gavin Newsom (D-CA)’s 24%, former Vice President Kamala Harris’s 22%, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg’s 11%, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-NY) 8%, and Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s (D-IL) 5%, per RealClearPolitics. \n\nGov. Andy Beshear (D-KY) has an average of 3% support, while Sens. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) have 3% apiece.\n\nPennsylvania Republican strategist Christopher Nicholas told the Washington Examiner his church prepared “for a 30-40% increase in our electric rates” when it compiled its budget this year.\n\n“That and groceries are top of mind for people, given the regularity in which we purchase energy and food,” Nicholas told the Washington Examiner. “Shapiro seems to relish campaigning against the president without going to war with him, so this is an intriguing development.”\n\n“PA makes and exports a lot of electricity,” the strategist added. “Politicians don’t stay in office long without understanding the changes in public opinion, and nascent data centers are a big and easy target.”\n\nFor Franklin & Marshall College Center for Opinion Research director Berwood Yost, Shapiro “has talked a good bit about energy during his tenure” so Friday’s event provided him with another platform to underscore the issue.\n\n“More importantly, this meeting is tied to personal budgets and affordability, so it also allows him to talk about an issue that will be important in his reelection bid,” Yost told the Washington Examiner. “On top of that, he probably sees the meeting as an opportunity to show voters he can work outside of his party to establish policies that will help them. This is the centerpiece of his brand.”\n\nTo that end, even before 2028, the Lancaster, Pennsylvania-based pollster, emphasized that Shapiro “being on the same stage” as Trump aids his reelection campaign because it could undercut Republican opponent Stacy Garrity’s support among the president’s supporters.\n\n“Many people do not realize how well Shapiro did in his first election with voters who have shied away from Democrats in recent elections,” Yost said. “Despite all the coverage of [Sen.] John Fetterman‘s successes among rural voters in 2022, Shapiro actually did better.”\n\nDemocratic governors with presidential aspirations are grappling with when and how to work with Trump as they simultaneously plot how they could replace him.\n\nSome, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI), have taken a bipartisan, more conciliatory approach, though Whitmer was surprised last April during a trip to the White House to discuss federal funding to assist Michigan’s recovery from an ice storm when Trump brought reporters into the Oval Office. \n\nPhotographers captured Whitmer trying to hide her face from them with a folder, an instantly meme-able image.\n\n“This is one of those moments where, as a public servant, you’re reminded your job is to put service above self, and that’s what it was all about,” Whitmer told Pod Save America at the time.\n\nOthers, including Newsom and Pritzker, have been more adversarial, with Newsom, in particular, being almost aggressive online as he and his staff troll Trump and the White House on social media.\n\nEven when Trump traveled to California last January to survey the devastation wreaked by the 2025 deadly wildfires, Newsom ensured photographers caught him pointing his finger at the president as he greeted him at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\n“As Donald Trump cancels free admission to National Parks on MLK Day, California will be offering FREE entry at more than 200 participating state parks. Honor MLK,” Newsom wrote on X on Friday. “Get outdoors. And stick it to an old man with a fragile ego.”\n\nAt the same time, Newsom has been conducting outreach to conservatives as he seeks to change perceptions of him as a liberal caricature to try to appeal to more centrist voters, hosting prominent right-leaning personalities on his own podcast.\n\nDemocratic strategist Andrew Bates contended that state and local leaders need to work with the president “at times, even if they disagree with the White House on almost everything.” \n\n“In Shapiro’s case, he’s fought PJM for years, beating them in court and saving 65 million Americans billions of dollars on their utility bills,” Bates told the Washington Examiner. “The White House is following his lead. He’s also fighting against Washington Republicans’ clean energy cuts, which are jacking up costs just to lower taxes for the rich. Shapiro and the other governors there [on Friday] are right to be involved, especially to stop the Trump administration from doing even more harm or building more corporate backdoors into their approach.”\n\nAlthough a spokesman for Shapiro did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner, a spokesman for Moore cited Friday’s event after a separate meeting Thursday between his governor and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on how to best rebuild Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge following the 2024 tanker collision.\n\n“@GovWesMoore and I have worked together for years to hold PJM accountable and lower energy bills for Pennsylvanians and Marylanders,” Shapiro wrote on Friday. “We stand together again today to sign an agreement between bipartisan PJM states and the federal government to extend our price cap and save consumers billions. Governors are leading the way — and together, we’ll continue fighting for the 67 million Americans who rely on PJM to keep the lights on.”\n\nFriday’s event on PJM Interconnection punctuates a week of bipartisan outreach from Trump after he telephoned Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Monday regarding capping credit card interest rates and met with Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Thursday related to the Gateway tunnel project between New York and New Jersey, not to mention reporting that he and New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani now text message one another following their sit-down in November.\n\n“President Trump has always been willing to work across party lines to deliver for the American people,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told the Washington Examiner. “The latest examples of President Trump’s bipartisan efforts should reemphasize to officials in blue states like Minnesota and Illinois that working alongside the president will make America safer and more affordable.”","summary":"Gov.

Your boss, who’s an amazing guy, might be bust,” Trump told Dokoupil, referring to billionaire Paramount CEO and Trump ally David Ellison’s fate should Kamala Harris have won the 2024 election. “You wouldn’t have this job—certainly whatever the hell they’re paying you.\"\n\n“For the record, I do think I’d have this job even if the other guys won,” Dokoupil responded, to which Trump said, “Yeah, but at a lesser salary.”\n\nCBS Evening News suffered an 11.4 percent drop in ratings during Dokoupil’s first week on the job, with the numbers looking even more dire for the key 25-44 demographic, where viewership was down 19.44 percent.\n\nDokoupil has received some support, however, with CNBC’s Joe Kernen telling him in a Tuesday X post, “Hang in there, you have many fans.” When another user mentioned Dokoupil’s poor ratings and suggested this meant he did not, in fact, have many fans, Kernen replied, “Well, let’s see, who was still watching CBS.”\n\n“People like you Jean.

Shakespeare warned, “Ingratitude is monstrous; and for the multitude to be ingrateful, were to make a monster of the multitude.” In the case of TPS, “multitude” is correct. As of January 2025, approximately 1.4 million foreign nationals in the United States were shielded from removal under the program. \n\nThe Trump administration decided to terminate TPS for several countries, with Somalia as the most recent. That choice is the right step in a long-overdue course correction for an immigration program that previous administrations exploited far past its statutory purpose. \n\nSomalia was first designated for TPS in 1991, following political turmoil and the outbreak of civil war. At the time, granting temporary protection to Somali nationals already present in the United States was an act of kindness. \n\nOver three decades later, Somalis remained dependent on the charity extended to them by the United States and distorted the TPS program beyond recognition from its original legislative intent. \n\nPast Administrations Haven’t Followed the Law \n\nTemporary Protected Status is governed by Section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1254a. According to federal law, TPS may be granted only when extraordinary and temporary conditions prevent safe return to a designated country. It applies only to individuals physically present in the United States at the time of designation. Foreigners who arrive after the fact are ineligible. \n\nTPS is not an open-ended invitation or a pathway to citizenship. \n\nYet over time, administrations treated TPS as anything but temporary. Excluding the first Trump administration, nearly every president extended or unlawfully redesignated TPS as a knee-jerk reaction, willfully pushing the program past its expiration date rather than enforcing the law. \n\nCongress imposed a mandatory review at 18 months precisely to prevent this outcome. And yet, as the deadline approached, bureaucratic habit won repeatedly, turning 18 months into 35 years in the case of Somalia. \n\nSection 244 does not authorize redesignation. It only permits designation, extension, and termination. The executive branch has not authority to cite the same emergency decades later to grant work authorization and removal protection to individuals who were not present in the United States when the original designation was made. That practice has no basis in statute and undermines our immigration system. \n\nThe Case of the Minneapolis Somalis \n\nThe consequences are rampant throughout the nation. Minneapolis is home to the largest Somali community in the world outside Somalia. In Minnesota, federal investigators have alleged that around $9 billion in Medicaid claims since 2018 may be fraudulent, potentially marking the largest scam in U.S. history. \n\nMany of the defendants charged in those cases are of Somali descent and several have pled guilty in court. Not all TPS recipients participate in criminal conduct, but Minneapolis serves as a case study on how abuse of immigration programs causes widespread reliance on the public benefit system created to serve Americans, not foreigners. \n\nThe costs are not always overt such as fraud; they also take hidden tolls. Minnesota’s English learner education funding doubled from $5.3 million in 2003 to $10.8 million in 2023, with Somali being the most popular first language in several schools besides Spanish. \n\nLong-running TPS designations create economic strains on health care, education, and other social services that were never intended to be permanent obligations. \n\nIt is no longer solely about a group of people who were offered brief protection in the ‘90s. According to the Department of Homeland Security, roughly 2,500 Somali nationals with TPS or pending applications will be affected by the termination. \n\nThose figures do not account for children and grandchildren born during the program’s 35-year existence at the taxpayer’s expense. The beneficiaries should have departed the country in the 1990s if perpetual redesignations had not occurred. \n\nCleaning Up the Biden Abuse of TPS \n\nThe Trump administration is trying to clean up the mess inherited by Kamala Harris’s open borders and immigration failures. The Biden administration deliberately expanded TPS, contrary to American security interests and granted TPS to over 1.4 million aliens by January 2025. \n\nPresident Joe Biden even urged Congress to pass legislation allowing TPS recipients to apply for green cards, highlighting how the administration viewed TPS as amnesty despite the law saying otherwise. \n\nFormer Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, extended and redesignated Somalia for TPS through March 2026, allowing new applicants and issuing automatic employment authorization extensions. \n\nThe massive expansion did not end with Somalia. TPS enrollment nearly quadrupled under the Biden administration, driven largely by new designations for Venezuela in 2021 and 2023. As of January 2025, more than 614,000 Venezuelans were protected under TPS, making up around half of all beneficiaries. \n\nA House report found that 95% were not admitted on visas and entered either illegally or through humanitarian parole—which is not a formal admission into the United States according to federal law. \n\nThe Supreme Court reiterated that truth in Sanchez v. Mayorkas in 2021, holding that TPS does not constitute an admission to the United States and does not translate into a pathway for lawful permanent residence. Any attempt to treat TPS otherwise reflects executive ignorance of both the legislative and judicial branch. \n\nMaking Temporary Mean Temporary Again \n\nEnding TPS for Somalia means that “temporary” will once again mean temporary. It also emphasizes that the United States will not reward aliens who try to override our laws. \n\nCongress is also responsible for allowing TPS to be manipulated. Lawmakers created the program and failed to enforce its limits. Congress should codify clear protections for Americans, including restricting eligibility to aliens present at the time of the triggering event, outlawing redesignation, capping active TPS periods at 18 months in absence of extraordinary justification, and requiring recipients to seek other immigration benefits if eligible or depart within one month of TPS termination. \n\nGenerosity is ruined by entitlement and mercy without limits enables a monster. TPS was meant to reflect American compassion without sacrificing the rule of law or public safety.","summary":"Congress created&#160;Temporary Protected Status&#160;(TPS)&#160;to&#160;briefly&#160;assist&#160;those in need.

That’s been rare so far","text":"A trio of Orange County officials is running for statewide executive office this year, and if any of them emerge victorious in November, it would be a bit of an anomaly.\n\nThat’s not just because former Huntington Beach city attorney Michael Gates and Supervisor Don Wagner are both Republicans running against Democratic incumbents in a very blue state in races for attorney general and secretary of state, respectively. And that’s also not only because former Rep. Katie Porter would be the first female governor in California.\n\nRather, it’s their home base: Orange County.\n\nDespite the county accounting for nearly 10% of California’s population, very few of its residents have been able to win statewide elections.\n\nThat’s certainly not due to a lack of political talent in Orange County, said Fred Smoller, an expert in media and politics who teaches at Chapman University.\n\nReally, it’s a structural curse, he said.\n\nLos Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco produce more statewide candidates because those cities have a centralized television news market and mayoralities that help boost candidates with name ID. Orange County doesn’t have that one mayoral position and shares TV media markets with Los Angeles and, to a lesser extent, San Diego.\n\n“There’s plenty of talented people from Orange County on both sides of the aisle,” said Smoller. “But there’s no centralized media and we suffer from the fact that we have no career ladder (like a mayor’s office) that would provide a platform for them to receive greater recognition.”\n\n“It’s a structural constraint,” Smoller added, “and that inhibits talent from both sides of the aisle from moving to a statewide office.”\n\nBut that’s not to say it’s impossible for an Orange County resident to be elected statewide.\n\nCase in point: Ken Cory, who lived in Westminster and Garden Grove, was elected to serve as the state’s controller in 1974. Cory, who served in the statehouse prior to the executive branch, was reelected in 1978 and 1982, leaving office after not seeking another term in 1986.\n\nCory, his obituary noted, was a Democrat who was respected by those on both sides of the aisle. He was dubbed “the man oil companies fear most.”\n\nThere’s also Thomas Kuchel, who hailed from Anaheim and, like Cory, served as the state’s controller. Kuchel, though, was also elected to the U.S. Senate, albeit some time ago: He was appointed to the Senate in 1953, winning subsequent reelections to the seat where he served for 16 years, including as the Republican whip. He served as controller from 1946 to 1953.\n\nKuchel was an infamous progressive in the Republican Party at the time, playing roles in the Senate’s work to pass Medicare, the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as well as conservation efforts and a nuclear test ban treaty.\n\nAnd there are others, too, with ties to Orange County. Probably chief among them: former President Richard Nixon, who, while he lived in Whittier and represented a Los Angeles County congressional seat, was born in Yorba Linda. His presidential library is in Yorba Linda, but when Nixon was president, the western White House was in San Clemente.\n\nThe presidency wasn’t Nixon’s only attempt to woo California voters all around the state. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1950, but a little more than a decade later, he’d lose a bid for governor, telling reporters after the loss, “Just think how much you’re going to be missing. You don’t have Nixon to kick around anymore.”\n\nJohn Seymour, a former Anaheim mayor and longtime Orange County politician, served in the U.S. Senate. But he was appointed to fill a vacancy and lost the election to the seat to the late Dianne Feinstein.\n\nMore recently, Loretta Sanchez, then an Orange County Congress member, made a run for what was an open U.S. Senate seat in 2016. But she finished second to Kamala Harris, then the state attorney general from San Francisco.\n\nSo what would it take for an Orange County politician to win elected office?\n\nIt’s more of an uphill battle, but not completely outside the realm of possibility, for a Republican to win, said Scott Spitzer, who teaches political science at Cal State Fullerton.\n\nIt depends on identity, he said, and whether candidates choose to focus on issues that would appeal to independent voters — taxes and cost of living, for example — rather than more polarizing issues, like gay marriage or climate change denial.\n\n“I do think there’s room for Republicans to win statewide office in California, but that’s not where the state Republican Party in California has been,” said Spitzer. “They’ve been pursuing a line of politics that’s nationally conservative and Trump-aligned, which doesn’t appeal to the moderate conservative voters in California. It definitely appeals to Republicans in pockets of the state, but it’s not going to win a statewide majority.”\n\nPorter recently lost a statewide bid, not even advancing past the primary in the race for an open U.S. Senate seat in 2024.\n\nBut she’s got the greater chance among the three in her quest for statewide office, both Smoller and Spitzer said, and her Orange County connection could actually be a boost.\n\n“In some ways, coming from Orange County could help her,” said Spitzer. “She could say, ‘Look, I could pull some votes from more conservative areas where other candidates are used to relying on San Diego and Los Angeles and San Francisco.’” She might not win those areas outright, Spitzer noted, but she could still pick up support there among people more familiar with her work.\n\nSmoller said Porter, although she’s a staunch progressive, could possibly sway more right-leaning voters as well, who might think she would keep the county’s interests more at the forefront than other candidates for governor.\n\n“She might make the appeal, ‘I’m not your cup of tea politically, but at least you know me, and we’d have someone from Orange County in the governorship,’” Smoller said.\n\n“I’m not sure that’s an argument that would sell, but she could certainly make it.”","summary":"Former Rep.

Bill Cassidy, chairman of the leading Senate committee on labor matters, sent a letter to United Auto Workers (UAW) president Shawn Fain on Friday, probing him about alleged “workplace retaliation” in the union.\n\nCassidy, R-La., who chairs the Senate committee on health, labor, education, and pensions (HELP), asked the labor leader to clarify reports of alleged retaliation against fellow UAW leaders for workplace disagreements.\n\n“Several news reports and two reports by the United Auto Workers’ (UAW) court-appointed Monitor … have detailed concerning instances of workplace retaliation under your leadership,” the letter reads.\n\nCassidy added that “these actions create a serious distraction from UAW’s purpose to improve and protect UAW members’ wages, benefits, work hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.”\n\nFain has served as the UAW’s president since 2023. The Detroit, Michigan-based union was founded in 1935.\n\nCassidy writes in the letter that he is “concerned that the cost of litigating these matters is a disservice to the American workers who pay dues to the UAW.”\n\nIn particular, Cassidy probes Fain on two allegations of workforce retaliation. In one instance, Fain is said to have removed “several departments” from the purview of UAW Secretary-Treasurer Margaret Mock as retaliation for “instituting strict policies governing expenses.”\n\nIn the other case, Cassidy points to a report from The Detroit News, which cites an anonymous source who said Fain removed the union’s Stellantis department from the oversight of Vice President Rich Boyer due to “a disagreement over staffing changes.”\n\nStellantis is the parent company which produces and sells Jeep, Chrysler, Fiat, Ram, and other vehicles.\n\nCassidy mentions that “Boyer states the dismissal was motivated by his refusal to make changes that would benefit your [fiancée] and your [fiancée’s] sister.”\n\nCassidy requests for clarification on whether the UAW has a workforce retaliation policy, as well as whether Faine’s fiancée or her sister would stand to benefit from Boyer’s removal. Cassidy also inquires if the UAW has a written policy on workplace nepotism.\n\nThe chairman asks several more questions of Fain on how these alleged actions affect workers, including whether Fain will commit to not raising dues on union members “to pay for internal UAW proceedings or any legal proceedings on these or other allegations of retaliation.”\n\nThe UAW did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fain and the union on the letter, the allegations it details, and whether they plan to respond to Cassidy.\n\nFain has served as the UAW’s president since 2023. The union, founded in 1935, is based in Detroit, Michigan. \n\nFain campaigned in support of then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ Democratic presidential bid in 2024, and was a harsh opponent of now-President Donald Trump, whom he called a “scab” who “doesn’t give a damn about working class people.” \n\nSince then, Fain has been critical of certain Trump policies, such as restricting federal workers’ unionization rights, but has also defended the president on policies such as tariffs.","summary":"FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL—Sen.

John Barrasso delivered the following speech about the Medicaid fraud schemes in Minnesota. Watch the speech, below, or read his remarks, lightly edited.\n\nWhen the government wastes even a dollar of your taxpayer money, you have a right to know what happened. When emboldened criminals steal money intended to help single moms and children in poverty, you have a right to be angry.\n\nAmericans are infuriated by the staggering fraud unfolding today in the state of Minnesota. The past few weeks have shown how deep the corruption has turned out to be.\n\nInvestigators have uncovered fraud schemes across 14 Minnesota Medicaid programs. Joe Thompson—U.S. Attorney in Minnesota—has spent his career prosecuting fraud. Based on his extensive investigation, he believes criminals have stolen at least $9 billion from those Minnesota Medicaid programs. That is half of the total amount of money Minnesota spends for Medicaid programs in that state.\n\nToday, the fraud is so prevalent that Thompson says the state has “developed a fraud tourism industry.” Can you imagine such a thing? A “Fraud Tourism Industry.”\n\nHere’s how these schemes work. Fraudsters set up fake businesses and nonprofit organizations. The criminals claim to provide services such as housing, food, and healthcare assistance. Then, they bill Medicaid for services they never provided. They enroll children in programs they don’t need. \n\nIn 2021, taxpayers paid $4.6 million for something called Minnesota’s Integrated Community Support Medicaid Program. Three years later—due to criminal fraud—spending for that program ballooned to more than $170 million. That’s 37 times as much in just three years. \n\nTaxpayers similarly paid $21 million in 2021 for something called Minnesota’s Housing Stabilization Services. In the first six months of 2025—due to criminal fraud—taxpayers paid nearly triple that amount.\n\nA Medicaid program claiming to help Minnesota children with autism cost $6 million in 2018. By 2023—due to criminal fraud—it cost taxpayers over $192 million. \n\nDaycare fraud is one of these brazen schemes. Last month, an independent journalist visited 10 state-funded daycare sites in the Twin Cities of Minnesota. He found no children at the daycare centers. Middle of the day. No children there.\n\nOne year ago, a local reporter visited several of the same sites. This reporter found no children at the daycare centers. These are supposed daycare centers. They’re getting paid to take care of children.\n\nHere is one of those sites. It is the now-infamous ‘Quality LEAR-ING Center.’ LEAR-ING. Instead of Learning. Misspelling the name of the daycare center. That’s an obvious red flag for fraud. There were 95 violations for that site alone between 2019 and 2023. Those violations include ‘no records for 16 children.’\n\nYet in Minnesota, taxpayer dollars continued to flow. \n\nThese aren’t one-off abuses. We now know that the fraud scheme used in the state’s childcare program has been used to defraud other social service programs. The New York Times says the fraud is ‘staggering in its scale and brazenness.’\n\nThe Department of Justice has charged 98 defendants in Minnesota Medicaid fraud-related cases. So far, 64 of these defendants have been convicted. Last month, one defendant was found guilty of stealing $14 million from Medicaid. She also stole nearly half a million dollars from a child nutrition program.\n\nThat stolen money was supposed to be used to provide 200,000 meals for hungry children. Instead, the defendant sent hundreds of thousands of dollars overseas. She bought real estate in Kenya in Africa.\n\nThis organized, systemic theft has gone on for years under the state’s Democrat leadership. It exploded under Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. \n\nThe Democrats have permitted schemes stacked upon schemes to drain money meant for those in need. Republicans will not allow this massive theft of taxpayer dollars to be ignored.\n\nWe are taking a comprehensive approach to root out fraud in Minnesota and across the country. Our Working Families Tax Cuts law fights fraud.\n\nWe strengthened eligibility requirements for Medicaid. We ensured illegal immigrants do not receive taxpayer-funded healthcare. We put in place work requirements for Medicaid and for Food Stamps. These policies protect taxpayers and increase accountability.\n\nAdditionally, Republicans are conducting aggressive congressional oversight. On Friday, the entire Senate Republican Conference demanded Gov. Walz explain his actions. We asked nine detailed questions. Questions such as why Minnesota failed to adopt key fraud prevention measures—measures the Department of Health and Human Services recommended to Minnesota in May. \n\nGov. Walz knew about this widespread fraud. He refused to do anything to stop it.\n\nSenate Republicans are ready to give the Trump administration the manpower it needs to tackle fraud in Minnesota and wherever else it appears. The Trump administration has asked the Senate to confirm a new Assistant Attorney General position—a position that will focus on fraud. The United States Senate will get that person in place and on the job quickly. \n\nThe Trump administration has taken other bold and deceive actions to stop fraud. To further strengthen enforcement efforts, the Department of Justice has doubled the number of attorneys handling these fraud cases. \n\nThe Treasury Department is cracking down on businesses in Minnesota for alleged money laundering. The Department of Health and Human Services under President Donald Trump froze federal funding for fraud-prone programs in Minnesota. \n\nIf Senate Democrats cared about stopping fraud, why are they preparing to vote today to loosen eligibility and income verifications for Obamacare subsidies?

According to the magazine, the “My Chick Bad” MC “wasn’t supposed to be on” the lineup in the first place. Representatives for the traveling festival confirmed the news, directing Billboard to Ludacris’ team “for any additional comments.”\n\nRock the Country, which launched in 2024 as a festival centering country music, announced its 2026 lineup on Monday (Jan. 12). Country superstars Kid Rock, Jason Aldean, Blake Shelton and Jelly Roll were listed as headliners, while additional performers included Ella Langley, Riley Green, Miranda Lambert, Brantley Gilbert, Shinedown, Gavin Adcock, Creed, Treaty Oak Revival, and, notably, “Hot In Herre” rapper Nelly. Not only did Nelly appear on the inaugural Rock the Country lineup, but he also performed at President Donald Trump’s second Inaugural Ball in 2025.\n\nKnown for Billboard Hot 100-topping rap and pop hits — as well as their past country crossover smashes — Ludacris’ and Nelly’s inclusions on the Rock the Country lineup quickly divided fans. In the Instagram comment section for the lineup poster, one user wrote, “[Ludacris], this is your crowd now? Pretty sad.” Another quipped, “In honor of Nelly and Ludacris appearing, they will be provided with their very own water fountain.” Ludacris was specifically scheduled to perform on Sunday, July 26, in Anderson, S.C.\n\nA sizable number of Luda’s fans also felt his appearance was an endorsement of the MAGA politics associated with the festival. In 2024, Adcock lambasted then-President Joe Biden onstage, also calling then-Vice President Kamala Harris a “b—h.” Last year, Trump introduced Kid Rock’s set with a simple video message: “Fight, fight, fight, win, win, win, for the American people.” One gobsmacked user shared a video declaring, “We about to put you over there with Kanye and Snoop … stop playing. Why’d you sign up for this? You got 48 hours to issue a statement, you got 48 hours to let us know you’re about to cancel this contract.”\n\nThis year’s Rock the Country festival will visit eight towns across the U.S., beginning with two stagings in Belleville, Tex., on May 1-2. Ludacris has yet to publicly comment on his removal from the lineup, while Nelly remains listed for the Hamburg, N.Y. dates on Sept. 11-12.\n\nAt press time, representatives for both Ludacris and Kid Rock have not responded to Billboard’s request for comment.\n\nCheck out the updated 2026 Rock the Country lineup on the festival’s official website.\n\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\n\nWant to know what everyone in the music business is talking about?\n\nGet in the know on\n\nVisit Billboard Pro for music business news\n\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2026 Billboard Media, LLC.

But it's still a Friday. The Libs let us get here AGAIN. That's 2 for 2 on Fridays in 2026. Patriots always win! Libs always lose. And now, they're cooked. We're here. We made it. We've got NFL playoff action tomorrow. We've got NFL playoff action Sunday. We've got the college football title game Monday. Who has it better than us? Nobody. Let's roll. Welcome to a Friday Nightcaps – the one where Louisville's new assistant volleyball coach has America's attention as we barrel towards the weekend. What else? I've got the best of the rest from a loaded week of #content, Kamala Harris sobbing over Trump's middle finger, MLB is in TROUBLE as of this morning, and Sophie Cunningham's knee rehab seems to be going WELL as the WNBA season quickly approaches (maybe). Grab you a fig newton for National Fig Newton Day, and settle in for a Friday 'Cap! Kamala with some all-time spin here Do Fig Newtons still exist? Feel like I haven't seen one in a MINUTE. I used to hammer those things growing up. The best. Well, not the best. But solid. They were always billed as a healthy snack, which, looking back now, is hilarious. Sort of like when Eggo and Cinnamon Toast Crunch were sold as vital parts to \"this complete breakfast.\" Remember those commercials? No wonder I was so fat: \"Vitamin-packed Frosted Flakes.\" Amazing. We really had it all in the 80s, 90s and early 2000s, and we pissed it right away. Sad. Anyway, let's get this class going. It's a Friday, after all. Kamala Harris fake-sobbed because Trump ‘defiled’ the White House this week with his VERY NASTY middle finger, and the grift with this one is truly amazing: What a week of #content! As Joe would say, ‘Come on, man!’ Don't you ever let anyone from the Biden Administration anywhere NEAR a pedestal. Don't you let them lecture you for one second. Not one single second. Kamala was a part of undoubtedly the most grotesque administration in American history. That's not hyperbole, although Bill and Monica would probably like a word. Again, these people invited THIS to the White House: This is the same White House, and the same president, that wished everyone a happy \"Trans Day of Visibility' on EASTER, by the way. The same one that had cocaine in the HALLS. The same guy who pardoned his entire family at the buzzer last January. The same vice president who, just 18 months ago, told Christian protesters that they were at the wrong rally. HER rally, by the way. The same one that looked like THIS for Christmas: Yeah, spare us the lecture, Kamala. We're good. Lunatic. OK, let's get to the best #content from a loaded week. Kyle Tucker bats leadoff! Dark days for MLB, Louisville's new coach & Zach Wilson is having a great offseason! Another solid week. Not our best, but it's also January and we're in the middle of just the longest month of the year, so I get it. Still, y'all made it work. Bravo. Couple thoughts … 1. Nothing like a good cup of coffee, am I right? Thanks, Sofia! 2. Farrah Abraham! As Obi-Wan once said, ‘Now there’s a name I haven't heard in a long time.' For those who don't remember her career arc, she was central casting in both MTV's 16-and-pregnant, and then again in MTV's Teen Mom. Just for good measure, she also had a sex tape leak. Cannot WAIT to cast my vote in 2026! 3. Sophie would also have my vote. 4. As for the Kyle Tucker/MLB stuff … Let's rapid-fire this Friday class into one of the final (or is it one of the first?) football weekends of the year. So, I spent my morning A) writing about Kamala, B) doing the newsletter, and C) doing some BIG J digging on this MLB situation. For those who don't know, it's about to get really nasty in about 11 months. The CBA is up at 11:59 on Dec. 1 of this year, and we will undoubtedly go into a work stoppage. The Dodgers, once again, signing another marquee free agent to a lucrative contract last night didn't help things. Here's what I found out in my Big J digging. The Dodgers really aren't at fault here. And yes, that pains me to say, because I'm a Red Sox fan. I hate LA. I hate its stupid Governor. I hate its stupid laws, and its stupid time zone. But … this isn't on the Dodgers. It's on Major League Baseball. The owners either won't spend, can't spend, or refuse to spend. The Dodgers, thanks to a lucrative – and well-timed TV deal back in 2013 – basically have endless money coming in each season. Nobody talks about that TV deal. I wrote about it extensively. LA basically has a budgetary floor each season that is infinitely higher than anyone else. Because of MLB's lax rules on luxury tax and deferrals, the Dodgers basically game the system by kicking the can down the road as far as possible, knowing they will have the money to cover it once the bill(s) come due. Anyway, it's all leading to a shutdown next season. Bank on it. Enjoy 2026, baseball fans. And that's my depressing Ted Talk for the day! Next? You know who isn't losing sleep over a looming lockout? Zach and Nicolette Wilson: No idea what Zach's gonna do now that Miami has cleaned house, but I think he'll be just fine wherever he lands. I just hope he stays somewhere warm, for obvious reasons. OK, that's it for today – and this week. Good work, everyone. Former Purdue star, and new Louisville volleyball coach, Jena Otec, takes us into a big weekend. See you Monday.

But they see this Senate race as yet another golden opportunity to break the GOP's winning streak. Party strategists have somehow convinced themselves that opposition to President Donald Trump could fuel an electoral wave big enough to finally deliver them a statewide victory. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called Texas a \"very possible\" Democratic pickup opportunity in 2026, though he hasn't quite put it in the top four targets.\n\nDespite being the presumptive frontrunner when she jumped into the race, Crockett is now trailing state Rep. James Talarico in the polls.\n\nThat's got to sting. Crockett, despite her national profile, is as big as her fake eyelashes, yet she is struggling in her own party’s primary. Her Senate campaign is clearly a last-ditch effort to remain in government after her district was redrawn. Now she's watching her supposed sure thing slip away before the primary even happens.\n\nHow is this happening?\n\nThe polling reveals some uncomfortable truths for Democrats. There's a clear racial divide between Crockett and Talarico. Talarico holds a majority among Hispanic and white voters, while Crockett has strong support among black voters. The gender gap is just as telling. Men favor Talarico by a wide margin, 52% to 30%, while women are almost evenly split between the two candidates, at 44% for Talarico and 43% for Crockett.\n\nRecommended: Hakeem Jeffries Just Crossed a Dangerous Line That Can’t Be Uncrossed\n\nWhile we can parse the demographic splits looking for an explanation, the answer is probably far more straightforward.\n\nTexas has become the Democrats' white whale. They've been trying to turn it blue for years without success, and the pattern is embarrassingly consistent. Back in 2018, some polls claimed that Beto O'Rourke was ahead of Ted Cruz. Cruz won that election. Then, in 2022, Beto tried to run for governor. Some polls said the race was close. Abbott ultimately won by 11 points. Fast forward to 2024, and polls once again gave Democrats hope and showed a close race between Cruz and Colin Allred. Cruz won by eight points. And don’t get me started on the polls that claimed Texas was in play for Kamala Harris.\n\nDespite the Democrats’ repeated failure to flip Texas, they keep throwing money and resources into the state, believing they still have a chance. Even in defeat, Democrats believe Texas is trending blue, and the rejection of Crockett in the Democratic Party primary is more likely a sign that Texas Democrats realize that they need a more pragmatic approach to choosing their candidates if they want to be even remotely competitive.\n\nDoes that really mean Tallerico can win? I wouldn’t bet on it. But, if you were a Democrat, do you really think a state that Trump won by more than 13 points is going to elect Jasmine Crockett? Of course not. Talarico may not win, but you’d probably still think you had a shot with anyone but Crockett.\n\nSo, sorry, Jasmine, things aren’t looking good for you right now. But, something tells me you won’t go away quietly.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2026/01/16/oh-jasmine-we-hardly-knew-ya-n4948394","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/345/656f695c-9f49-4729-8341-c76fa2190eec.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 20:28:00","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.375},{"id":393645984,"title":"Everything we know about Charlie Kirk’s alleged ‘assassin’ Tyler Robinson","text":"To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n browser that\n supports HTML5\n video\n\n Up Next\n\n Previous Page\n\n Next Page\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMore than four months after right-wing activist Charlie Kirk was shot dead, prime suspect Tyler Robinson remains in custody as he prepares for his trial.\n\nKirk, 31, a close ally of US President Donald Trump, was killed by a single gunshot fired from a rooftop as he spoke onstage during an outdoor campus event attended by 3,000 people in Utah on September 10. \n\nTyler James Robinson, 22, has been charged with offences including aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, and obstruction of justice over the shooting.\n\nIf convicted of killing Kirk, the charge means he could face the death penalty.\n\nHe is due to appear in court later today, with his defence team set to argue that one of the prosecutors needs to be removed from the trial due to their 18-year-old child being at the event where Kirk was killed.\n\nRobinson is reported to have raised suspicions while speaking with relatives, Utah Governor Spencer Cox said.\n\n Tyler Robinson is being held on suspicion of aggravated murder, and felony discharge of a firearm, among other offences (Picture : AP)\n\nMr Cox called Kirk’s murder a ‘watershed in American history’ and comparing it to the rash of US political assassinations of the 1960s.\n\nUtah County attorney Jeff Gray said Robinson’s DNA was found on the trigger of the rifle, alleging Robinson discarded the rifle and clothing and asked his roommate to conceal evidence.\n\nRobinson left a note under a keyboard saying he planned to kill Kirk and confessed after the shooting, documents allege.\n\nGray said Robinson’s romantic partner, who was reportedly trans, sent the suspect several messages on the day of the shooting.\n\n‘Drop what you’re doing. Look under my keyboard,’ Robinson said in one text. Under it, the partner found a note that said: ‘I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I’m going to take it.’\n\nRobinson’s next hearing has been scheduled for September 29 at 10am, and will be held using WebEx.\n\nWho is Tyler Robinson?\n\nMr Cox told reporters the suspect had lived for a long time with his family in Washington County in the southwest corner of Utah, near the Arizona and Nevada borders.\n\nRobinson did not appear to have any criminal history, according to state records.\n\nHe was a registered voter but was not affiliated with a political party, according to voter records.\n\nHe is listed as an ‘inactive’ voter, which indicates he did not cast a ballot in last year’s presidential election, when Republican Trump defeated Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\n Mr Kirk, 31, was answering a question about gun violence at Utah Valley University on Wednesday when he was shot (Picture: Reuters)\n\n The body of Charlie Kirk is carried from Air Force Two (Picture: Reuters)\n\nAt the time of the shooting, he was a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College, part of Utah’s public university system.\n\nAn honour roll student in high school who scored in the 99th percentile nationally on standardised tests, he was admitted to Utah State University in 2021 on a prestigious academic scholarship, according to a video of him reading his acceptance letter posted to a family member’s social media account.\n\nHe attended for only one semester, according to a university spokesperson.

Robinson, he said, was just a regular student with an interest in music, who hung out with members of the school band.\n\n‘I knew him in passing. Just your average kid,’ said Timothy, who lives two blocks from the Robinson family.\n\n‘Tyler, he was quiet, but not too quiet.’\n\nWho are his parents?\n\nRobinson has two younger brothers, and his parents Amber Jones Robinson and Matt Robinson have been married for about 25 years, according to social media posts.\n\nHis parents are registered to vote as Republicans but none of their social media posts appeared overtly political.\n\nPosts by Robinson’s mother reflect an active family with vacations to Disneyland, Hawaii, the Caribbean and Alaska.\n\nThey frequently spent time outdoors — boating, fishing, riding ATVs, zip-lining and target shooting.

John Bolton, his former national security adviser turned critic, is living under a politically hatched indictment, and Mike Pence, his first-term vice president, was exposed to a violent mob for executing his constitutionally mandated duties.\n\nYet Powell’s case is distinct because he—more than any other top-level civil servant—helped secure the most significant policy triumph of Trump’s career. He even played a crucial part in Trump’s eventual reelection.\n\nDuring the Obama years, after the mortgage bust, Ben Bernanke and the Fed kept the short-term interest rate close to zero, setting the stage for Powell’s role in the Trump economy. Free money was great for stock-market investors, but Main Street’s recovery was torpid.\n\nIn 2018, when Powell took office, a year into Trump’s first term, the federal funds rate was still only 1.5 percent. Under Powell, the Fed gradually hiked the rate to 2.5 percent and then pulled back. Trump squawked and mused about firing Powell.\n\nTrump’s carping notwithstanding, economic growth spiked during Powell’s first year to 3 percent, the highest since the mid-2000s, and wages rose at the fastest rate since before the financial crisis. Growth remained a still-strong 2.6 percent in 2019. And thanks to Powell’s refusal to cave to the president, inflation remained muted. In other words, wage gains translated to real gains in living standards. Inequality, as measured by the Fed Survey of Consumer Finances, actually contracted. By any fair measure, economic performance during the first three years of Trump 1.0 was good, and the Fed chief deserved credit—which never emanated from the White House.\n\nPowell’s record during Joe Biden’s presidency was far more mixed. When the pandemic shut down the economy during 2020, Powell cut the federal funds rate to effectively zero. And left it there.\n\nBiden, inaugurated nine months after the COVID recession ended, enacted a massive deficit-spending program. He styled himself a second version of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Just as Trump had pursued a highly stimulative program (particularly with his tax cut), so did Biden. The purposes were different, but both added to inflationary pressures.\n\nUnder Biden, Powell did not experience overt pressure from the White House, but there was soft pressure on the Fed not to choke off the recovery, and to align with the executive during a crisis. Both Powell and the Biden White House misread the COVID recession as similar to the 2008 mortgage meltdown. In a financial crisis, recoveries are typically slow. People’s assets are underwater and stimulus is needed for a protracted period. During the COVID recession, once people exited the initial lockdown, the crisis was over.\n\nWhen COVID struck, Powell kept the overnight interest rate at or below 1 percent for more than two years, until June 2022. By then, the annualized inflation rate had hit 9.1 percent, the highest in 40 years.\n\nPowell then became serious about fighting inflation and eventually brought it under control, but the damage was done. In effect, Powell had saved Trump from his worst instincts but failed to do so for Biden.\n\nThe statistic known as “real median household income” vividly contrasts what happened to the typical family’s living standard during each presidential term, after adjusting for inflation. During Trump’s first term, it rose 10 percent before COVID and 8.2 percent overall. Under Biden, it rose 2.6 percent.\n\nWhen Trump ran for reelection in 2020—before there was even a vaccine for COVID—the pandemic recession was on voters’ minds. But four years later, when voters told pollsters that the economy had been better under Trump than under Biden, median household income is what they were remembering, even if that’s not how they articulated it.\n\nInflation was probably the greatest factor in Trump’s defeat of Kamala Harris. Trump and Biden were both reckless deficit spenders, but thanks to Powell’s tougher stance against inflation, Trump’s economy performed better, and that secured his political comeback.\n\nTrump’s response to this good fortune has been to attack the independence of the Fed and of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that collects much of the data on which the Fed relies. Toward Powell, he has been vindictive (for what, exactly?) and mean-spirited.\n\nTrump wants Powell to lower rates, just as the Fed kept them low under Biden. This would risk repeating the Biden-era inflation that Trump campaigned against. Does this make sense? Not to me, either.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/jerome-powell-fed-trump-thankless/685653/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/lcKbYryyRSso5I6OvwNmtQk4R0c=/0x0:4000x2250/720x405/media/img/mt/2026/01/2026_01_16_How_Jay_Powell_Helped_Re_Elect_Trump/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 19:50:54","author":"Roger Lowenstein","authors":["Roger Lowenstein"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.005},{"id":393631202,"title":"Trump donor, dark money largely funding Maine referendum drives","text":"Funding for two state referendum drives is coming almost exclusively from out-of-state sources. \n\nA citizen initiative to end recreational marijuana sales and add tracking and testing requirements to medical marijuana received a $2 million infusion from Smart Approach to Marijuana Action Inc., a dark money group from Virginia. \n\nAnd a citizen initiative to remove transgender protections for students is mostly funded by an $800,000 contribution from conservative megadonor Richard Uihlein, the founder of the Wisconsin-based Uline Corp., a shipping supplies company. \n\nThe disclosures contained in campaign finance reports filed this week show the outsized role that national groups may play in deciding local issues in the 2026 election cycle.

The group spent $740,000 on signature gathering, records show. \n\nMeanwhile, an effort to end Maine’s recreational cannabis program and increase regulations on medicinal marijuana is being funded by an out-of-state dark money group. \n\nSAM Action Inc. is the sole donor listed on reports filed by Mainers for a Safe and Healthy Future, Inc., which is leading the petition drive. \n\nAbout $500,000 has been spent so far, mostly for gathering signatures. \n\nSAM Action is a 501c(4), so it is not required to report its donors. \n\nThe group, which opposes the the legalization and commercialization of marijuana, claimed $15.9 million in revenue in 2024, according to Propublica. \n\nThe anti-marijuana campaign in Maine was accused by cannabis supporters this week of deceiving voters while collecting the signatures necessary to place its initiative on the ballot. \n\nPeople across the state have reported that petition gatherers have been falsely pitching the initiative as a way to ensure that cannabis sold at shops is free of toxic chemicals. \n\nPetitioners must gather 67,682 signatures from registered Maine voters by Feb. 2 to qualify for the November ballot.","summary":"Campaign finance reports filed Thursday showed the out-of-state forces shaping local issues.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2026/01/16/trump-donor-dark-money-largely-funding-maine-referendum-drives/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/40027920__20241016_04taintedweed-1730318814.jpg?w=780","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 19:17:14","author":"Randy Billings","authors":["Randy Billings"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.093},{"id":393642406,"title":"The 'Cult of Jasmine Crockett' Refuses to Move on From the  'Reign of Terror' Racial Politics of 2020","text":"However, the fact is that this is, indeed, 2026, and \"history\" is proving to be worth exactly squat when predicting elections. The results this November will depend more on the voters' perception of which side understands and speaks to their real concerns.\n\n\"Affordability\" is a catchphrase, not a definition or a policy declaration. Democrats are going to rely, as they have been since at least 2008, on radical racial politics and trying to paint the right as Nazis or closet kluxers.\n\nJosh Barro wrote an essay pointing out that the enthusiastic support for \"bomb-thrower\" Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) in her bid for the Democratic Party nomination to the U.S. Senate demonstrates why many Democrats are stuck in the past, trying to define everything through the prism of race.\n\nNot only is Crockett a hyper-partisan nut, but she's also out-and-out stupid.\n\nOr, consider what Crockett said when Republicans sought to censure Stacey Plaskett, the non-voting delegate representing the U.S. Virgin Islands, for her ties to the late Jeffrey Epstein. Crockett went to the House floor with a list of Republicans who had taken donations from “Jeffrey Epstein,” including Lee Zeldin, the former congressman from Long Island who now serves as EPA Administrator. But there was a problem — the Jeffrey Epstein who donated to Zeldin is a Long Island neurosurgeon who made his donations in 2020, after the notorious Manhattan financier Epstein had died.\n\nHer explanation for getting the two Jeffery Epsteins mixed up is a primer on how to never admit you're wrong, even not doing so makes you look even dumber.\n\n\"Listen, I never said that it was that Jeffrey Epstein,\" she told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. \"Just so that people understand, when you make a donation, your picture is not there… unlike Republicans, I at least don’t go out and just tell lies. Because it was not the same one — that’s fine.\"\n\nBarro points out that \"she’s a loudmouth who talks a lot of s**t in a way that’s neither smart nor strategic.\" He added, \"She appeals to the sort of voter who is so partisan that he or she thinks 'I never said that it was that Jeffrey Epstein” is a good argument.\"\n\nFor this reason, Crockett has a very good chance of winning the Democratic Party primary in March to face either incumbent Sen. John Cornyn or Attorney General Ken Paxton, who are running neck and neck in the polls. She's running eight points behind Rep. James Talarico, another radical left bomb-thrower. Barro believes, \"what makes him stand out in the crowd is his choir boy/seminarian persona.\"\n\nRelated: Pray That Elizabeth Warren's Vision for a 'New' Democratic Party Comes True in Time for Midterms\n\nBarro sees the problem because Democratic Party voters have developed \"deeply dysfunctional relationships to black women as political candidates.\" Not just Crockett, but Kamala Harris, Stacey Abrams, Fani Willis, and Tish James. These are all barely competent (or worse) office holders who have legions of white liberals standing up for them, no matter what stupidity or illegal crap they pull.\n\nOf course, the grant of inherent moral authority does not extend to all black women, but only to black women who agree with the person issuing the grant — as Steve Morris noted on this week’s Central Air (see link below), a liberal who worships Crockett or Abrams is unlikely to extend the same reverence to a socialist like Nina Turner or a moderate like Lauren Underwood, let alone to a Republican like Winsome Earle-Sears. But the idea that moral authority arises from black female identity is what makes Crockett so popular as a meme: liberals, even if they are not themselves black or female, can share her “clapbacks” online and see them as final-boss slams that win arguments, even if what she is saying is false (Zeldin accepted money from Epstein) or politically damaging (Hispanic voters have a “slave mentality”) or contentless (Greene has a “bleach-blond bad-built butch-body”).\n\nThey have created a mythos around black female candidates because \"black women are an essential part of the Democratic Party coalition — they vote overwhelmingly for Democrats, and their votes are needed to win elections.\" This mythos has led \"to a view that there is inherent moral authority that arises from being a black female Democrat,\" Barro writes. \n\nAs long as Democratic midterm voters are stuck in that mindset, neither Crockett nor Talarico has much of a chance against any Republican in the field.\n\nThe same might be said of Democrats across the country. Republican losses will be minimized, and in some districts, the left will actually work in the GOP's favor, giving it a fighting chance of maintaining control of Congress.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/rick-moran/2026/01/16/the-cult-of-jasmine-crockett-refuses-to-move-on-from-the-reign-of-terror-racial-politics-of-2020-n4948387","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/324/967fd60e-aab8-4de5-a5f1-c4ed7a5a66c1.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 19:00:00","author":"Rick Moran","authors":["Rick Moran"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.199}]}
