Phil Murphy’s office furiously tried to back-peddle Monday after he boasted that he had opened his home to a migrant and taunted the Trump administration “to try to get her.’’\n\nA rep told The Post that the loose-lipped Jersey leader had been “misinterpreted” and that no such situation had occurred — even though Murphy had dared the feds to come after the migrant.\n\nMurphy had boasted during a weekend interview with a liberal organization that he and wife Tammy had opened their home to a female migrant and challenged the feds to do anything about it — as ICE agents continue to carry out sweeping deportation raids across the country.\n\n“I don’t want to get into too much detail, but there’s someone in our broader universe whose immigration status is not yet at the point that they are trying to get it to and we said, ‘You know what, let’s have her live at our house above our garage,’ ” the Democrat said Saturday.\n\n“And good luck to the feds coming in to try to get her.”\n\nHis incendiary comments created a firestorm, forcing a representative to furiously try to walk them back to The Post.\n\nMurphy was just referring to a legal resident who is in his circle of friends and was worried about President Trump’s return to the White House, the governor’s rep said.\n\n“No one’s ever lived in the home” under those circumstances that the governor described, the representative insisted.\n\nThe rep did not explain why Murphy, who lives with his family in a mansion in Middletown, NJ, would dare the Trump administration to go after the woman at his home if she wasn’t there.\n\nHis public challenge to the Republican White House was not his only swipe at President Trump during Saturday’s on-stage discussion with Blue Wave New Jersey, a grassroots organization that pushes liberal causes, at Montclair State University in Montclair, NJ.\n\nMurphy, an ex-US ambassador to Germany under former President Barack Obama, appeared to compare the administration to the rise of Nazism in the European country nearly a century ago when warning audience members to gear up for the next four years.\n\n“The Germans in the ’20s and ’30s got tired, they got sick of fighting, and look at the price we paid,” he said. \n\n“We cannot roll over, we cannot stop fighting,” he said to a round of applause. “We need an intensity.”\n\nHe then complained about low voter turnout for Democrats “against this guy,” in reference to Trump.\n\n“I mean, my God, it’s not like we’re wondering what he’s gonna be like,” he said. “We know what he’s like, and we can’t let that happen again ever, ever, ever.”\n\nTrump gave Vice President Kamala Harris, his Dem presidential opponent, a scare in the blue Garden State in November when he collected nearly 46% of the vote against her 51% – a massive improvement from his first two White House runs.\n\nIn 2020 against Joe Biden, Trump only garnered about 41% of the vote.","summary":"A rep told The Post that the loose-lipped Jersey leader had been \"misinterpreted'' and that no such situation had occurred -- even though Murphy had dared the feds to come after the migrant.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/03/us-news/nj-gov-phil-murphys-claim-hes-protecting-migrant-at-his-home-wasmisinterpreted-rep-insists/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/new-jersey-governor-phillip-murphy-97856061.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/QLOeu9wi-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-03 23:47:20","author":"Carl Campanile,David Propper","authors":["Carl Campanile","David Propper"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.355},{"id":286775812,"title":"Susan Collins backs Tulsi Gabbard for DNI ahead of Tuesday vote","text":"Moderate Sen. Susan Collins backed Tulsi Gabbard’s bid to become director of national intelligence ahead of a key committee vote Tuesday, in a significant boost for the former Hawaii rep’s prospects.\n\nCollins (R-Maine), 72, who isn’t afraid to buck the GOP, having voted against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last month, praised Gabbard’s push to downsize the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\n“After extensive consideration of her nomination, I will support Tulsi Gabbard to be the Director of National Intelligence,” Collins said in a statement Monday.\n\n“The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, however, has become far larger than it was designed to be, and Ms. Gabbard shares my vision of returning the agency to its intended size.”\n\nThe Maine Republican helped write the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which established the DNI position in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to enhance coordination between the 18 federal intelligence agencies. \n\nGabbard, 43, sat before the Senate Intelligence Committee last week and was greeted by a handful of skeptical Republicans who were leery of her past record on key national security flashpoints. \n\nCollins previously sounded skeptical of Gabbard and grilled her during the hearing last week about whether she ever met with any known members of Hezbollah, noting the “speculation in the press.”\n\n“No,” Gabbards shot back at the time, calling it an “absurd accusation.”\n\nPrior to the hearing, Collins also seemed unconvinced by Gabbard’s change of heart on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Section 702, which gives the feds broad powers to conduct surveillance on non-Americans living overseas. \n\nAs a congresswoman, Gabbard had been a fierce critic of Section 702, amid concerns that it could result in the incidental collection of intel on US citizens in violation of the Fourth Amendment against surveillance without a warrant. \n\nBut during the hearing, Gabbard explained her reversal on Section 702 and underscored her commitment to safeguarding national security. \n\n“The national security capability that is provided by Section 702 that enables this foreign surveillance on non-US persons overseas is critical, period,” she affirmed during the public portion of her hearing.\n\nCollins also explained that Gabbard “addressed my concerns regarding her views on Edward Snowden.” \n\nGabbard was repeatedly pressed on the controversial NSA leaker and declared that he “broke the law” and that she did “not agree with or support all of the information and intelligence that he released, nor the way in which he did it.”\n\nShe stressed that her goal is to prevent “another Snowden-like leak.”\n\nCollins is ranked as the most moderate Republican in the upper chamber by GovTrack. She’s also been dubbed the most bipartisan member of the chamber by Lugar Center and the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy. \n\nThe Maine senator is perhaps the most endangered Republican up for reelection in the 2026 cycle, hailing from a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris won by almost seven percentage points.\n\nStill, she was previously perceived as an underdog against former state House speaker Sara Gideon in 2020, having trailed her in nearly every poll, including by double digits in some cases. Ultimately, Collins won by 8.6 points.","summary":"Moderate Sen.

It applies to broadcasters but not cable. A group brought a non-frivolous complaint, so the FCC is taking the next appropriate step in adjudicating the issue.\n\nCarr, who was appointed by Trump to lead the agency, has not ruled out taking testimony from “60 Minutes” producers and correspondent Bill Whitaker, who conducted the Harris interview, people close to the matter told the Post.\n\n“No decision has been made about additional steps,” Carr added.\n\nCBS News begrudgingly agreed to hand over the transcript over the weekend after first balking at the demand by Trump, who has sued the Paramount Global-owned network for $10 billion for deceptively editing the Harris interview.\n\nCarr has yet to receive the document but is expecting to have it in hand before the end of business on Monday, he said.\n\nCBS said in a statement that Carr alerted the network last week about the inquiry and asked for the “full, unedited transcript and camera feeds from our interview with Vice President Harris, which aired on Oct. 7, 2024. We are working to comply with that inquiry as we are legally compelled to do.”\n\nWhile the transcript demand refers specifically to the complaint filed by CAR, the outcome of Carr’s investigation has broader ramifications for Paramount, people close to the FCC told The Post.\n\nThe FCC is in the middle of reviewing Paramount’s $8 billion merger with independent studio Skydance, and Carr is said to be weighing whether CBS News’ overall coverage was politically biased against Trump and Republicans in general during the 2024 election cycle, as has been alleged.\n\nFCC rules prohibit overt political bias, and subject networks to equal time provisions, when they broadcast news over public airwaves as opposed to cable, which doesn’t fall within such guidelines.\n\nIf Carr finds that there was deceptive editing, he could not only rule in favor of the Center for American Rights, but also throttle the Paramount-Skydance deal, which is set to close by March.\n\nAmong the potential remedies: Carr could demand concessions to ensure future fairness as a condition for final approval, the Post has learned.\n\n A Skydance rep had no comment.\n\nTrump could use whatever evidence comes from Carr’s investigation to advance his lawsuit against the network.\n\nCBS News and Trump are in what has been described to The Post as “very preliminary settlement talks” over the lawsuit, filed in October in federal court in North Texas.\n\nThe Tiffany Network has denied there was any bias but may want to be rid of the legal scuffle with the president, similar to Disney’s decision to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Trump against ABC News after “This Week” host George Stephanopoulos claimed he was “liable for rape,” when no such verdict was rendered in a separate civil suit. Disney agreed to pay $15 million toward Trump’s presidential library and another $1 million in legal fees.\n\nIn a statement at the time of Trump’s lawsuit, CBS News said: “When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point.”\n\nCarr is a longtime telecom activist and FCC commissioner before Trump named him to chair the agency. He made a name for himself raising questions about the Chinese-owned short-video app TikTok and whether the CCP is using the service for spycraft.\n\nHarris, Joe Biden’s VP and running mate until the former president dropped out of the race last summer, is long known for providing incomprehensible answers, so-called word salad, when addressing simple questions on policy matters.\n\nCriticism of the interview emerged after “60 Minutes” aired a promo for the segment where Harris appeared more coherent in answering a question involving the Middle East than when the final edited interview ran.\n\nProving outright bias as opposed to sloppy editing won’t be easy. And despite FCC rules on fairness, all news shows have significant First Amendment protections, particularly against government censorship.\n\nBut critics of the network say “60 Minutes” and CBS in general has devolved from unbiased news reporting over public airwaves that must abide by FCC fairness guidelines.\n\nThe network was once considered the gold standard of unbiased journalism, but conservative media critics say that in recent years it has increasingly tilted to the left.\n\nThat bias was on display, they claim, during the 2024 election cycle. They point to the constant fact-checking of Trump’s running mate JD Vance during the vice presidential debate hosted by the network.\n\nCritics also cited the internal pressure imposed on “CBS Mornings” anchor Tony Dokoupil after his tough questioning of far-left writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, who penned a screed that attacked Israel for its response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas massacre.","summary":"The outcome of Carr's investigation has broader ramifications for Paramount, people close to the FCC told The Post.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/03/media/fcc-chair-brendan-carr-says-hell-fast-track-cbs-probe-over-editing-of-kamala-harris-60-minutes-interview/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/kamala-harris-fcc.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1738595164&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-03 23:00:40","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.099},{"id":286765844,"title":"Love Island: All Stars' Gabby Allen makes VERY X-rated confession as she admits she feels 'mugged off' by Casey O'Gorman after heart rate challenge","text":"Black Friday\n\nThe Traitors\n\nThe Masked Singer\n\nLove Island All Stars\n\nDancing On Ice\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Feb 3rd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLove Island: All Stars' Gabby Allen makes VERY X-rated confession as she admits she feels 'mugged off' by Casey O'Gorman after heart rate challenge\n\nHave YOU got a story?

She's evicting Scott,'; \n\nHe then grabbed Su Cülcüloğlu, 30, who he is coupled up with, and lifted her off the ground as they writhed and simulated sex while their fellow singletons screamed\n\nCurtis was back wearing his feathered headdress and little else, which made him an internet sensation when he wore it during his first villa stint in 2019 (R)\n\nWhen it was later revealed that Curtis had raised the most heart rates, viewers at home were convinced the majority of the girls were actually terrified rather than tantalised \n\nTaking to X they said: ' Heart was racing for Curtis cuz [sic] they were scared'\n'Elma is sat there shocked and crying but she was literally shouting at him to leave, the night before,';\n'Elma needs to realise the impact she had on Scott's decision.

I only see this kind of savagery from Lord Sugar on The Apprentice.'\nScott, 36, announced he was leaving the villa and going home during Sunday night's episode, following the explosive row with Elma and Tina.\nIn a dramatic move that has left the villa in shock, Scott packed his bags and left the ITV show after deciding it 'wasn't for him' and struggling to find a genuine connection with Tina and axed islander India Reynolds.\nPulling Luca Bish over to the fire pit first he said: 'I just wanted to let you know first. I can't force connections and I feel like I've come here and done everything I wanted to do. I just have to be true to myself.'\n\nIt comes after viewers have hit out at Elma Pazar for crying after Scott Thomas quite the show - despite telling him to leave\nTelling the rest of the islanders, he said: 'I don't want this to be sad guys because I've had the best time ever but I've made the decision to leave.\n'I've had the best time ever.

The new DNC chairman, Ken Martin, said the party already has “the right message” for voters.\n\nThe selection of Martin is the biggest sign yet that Harris will be back at the top of the ticket in four years. The Democratic establishment’s choice was Ben Wikler, who had the backing of all the major players: former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), possible presidential candidate Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI), and multiple Democratic megadonors including George Soros’s Democracy PAC.\n\nThe big name not to endorse was Harris, who got exactly what she presumably wanted; Martin was the vice chairman of the Harris-Walz campaign. The DNC also heavily rewarded Harris’s former running mate, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN). Martin was a Minnesota state party leader, and the DNC heeded Walz’s endorsement and chose gun control activist David Hogg as one of its vice chairs, a big Walz booster who relentlessly pushed the Harris campaign to choose him as her running mate. The campaign that lost in embarrassing fashion to Donald Trump, complete with losing every single swing state, was just cemented as the power central of the next iteration of the DNC.\n\nMost notable of all, there is no self-reflection to be had among Democrats. Harrison did not think former President Joe Biden should have gotten out of the race sooner, and Martin doesn’t want to relitigate that debate either. Martin thinks the Democratic Party only has a “brand” problem, continuing the perpetual Democratic complaint that voters just don’t understand how perfect all the policies they support are. There is no real change in messaging or policy on the horizon and no real change in leadership either.\n\nThe DNC has chosen to close off all avenues of self-reflection, maintaining that Biden’s collapsing candidacy overstaying its welcome and Harris’s identity politics-drowned campaign were exactly what they wanted to offer voters. Democrats want to stick with their identity obsession and ignore any problems with the mediocrities they rallied around last year, and they are gearing up to run it all back in the next election cycle.","summary":"The Democratic National Committee has decided that there are no lessons to be learned from the 2024 elections.

However, when they reached the photographers’ section, Censori turned and dropped her black feather coat to reveal an entirely nude look in a sheer mini-dress.\n\n“Nah. This is crazy... This isn’t haute couture. This isn’t fashion,” one person wrote about the stunt on X.\n\n“The way everyone went silent for a second after she dropped the coat,” another pointed out.\n\n“So we are just walking around naked now,” added a third.\n\nIn a post on Instagram, Entertainment Tonight reported that West and Censori had been “escorted out after showing up uninvited.” That post was quickly deleted, but not before being shared widely on social media.\n\nHowever, Variety disputed reports that West and Censori were asked to leave, quoting a source close to the Grammys as saying it was “not true” and that West simply “walked the carpet, got in his car and left.”\n\nLater on, the couple was spotted at the Grammys afterparty as photos obtained by PageSix showed Censori clinging to the Donda artist, 47, and sticking her tongue out in a skimpy, sheer black bodysuit.\n\nMeanwhile, West was photographed grabbing onto his wife’s bare backside and kissing her tongue in his signature black Prada shades.\n\nThe incident took place one day after the rapper posted a sexualized tweet about former Vice President Kamala Harris on X.","summary":"Boone was nominated for Best New Artist at the Grammys","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/benson-boone-grammys-crotch-grab-b2691443.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/03/9/32/Benson-Boone.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ZRVmVzTt-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-03 21:02:23","author":"Brittany Miller","authors":["Brittany Miller"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.079},{"id":286747694,"title":"Dana White begged Donald Trump to drop out of presidential race after assassination attempt, UFC boss reveals","text":"BREAKING NEWSDana White begged Donald Trump to drop out of presidential race after assassination attempt, UFC boss reveals\n\nREAD MORE: Jake Paul's cornerman goes viral over Donald Trump-inspired hat \n\nPODCAST: On Welcome to MAGAland - Trump’s response to the tragic D.C plane crash, plus is project 2025 really a myth?\n\nBy ALEX RASKIN\n\nPublished: 20:29 GMT, 3 February 2025 | Updated: 20:55 GMT, 3 February 2025\n\nDana White is thrilled to see his friend Donald Trump in the White House, but as the UFC President told Piers Morgan, he actually wanted the Republican candidate to drop out of the race after surviving an assassination attempt on the campaign trail.\n\n'Why are you doing this stuff?' White asked rhetorically on Piers Morgan Uncensored. 'Stop. I told him to stop so many times. It's just like, ''You have such a good life, and you could do all these other things.''\n\nAccording to White, Trump told him: 'I can't quit. You don't ever quit. You never quit.'\n\n'But the thing is, with President Trump is he believes in God, and he's very religious…He believes that, to his core, that God has spared his life to be the President and do the things that he's going to do over the next four years.'\n\nThe July 13 shooting in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania claimed the life of one Trump supporter, Corey Comperatore. The shooter, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was killed by US Secret Service on the scene. \n\nTrump's ear was scratched during the shooting, resulting in some bleeding, but the 78-year-old continued on the campaign trail despite his injuries - and the warnings from White. \n\nWhite says Trump believes he was saved by God from the assassin on July 13. However, shooter did wound one attendee, Corey Comperatore, who ultimately died from his injury \n\nDana White is thrilled to see his friend Donald Trump in the White House, but as the UFC President told Piers Morgan, he actually wanted the Republican candidate to drop out\n\nDave Portnoy rates Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter's Grammy outfits after ripping Kanye West\n\n'I was flying to Italy when that happened, and my wife woke me up and said, ''They just shot President Trump,'' White recalled. 'I was freaking out, texting the family, and when I landed, I called him, and he was already home from the hospital and unfazed. I mean, unfazed, and everybody wants to talk smack.'\n\nWhite criticized wrestler Dave Bautista for mocking Trump in the wake of the shooting. Bautista has repeatedly challenged Trump supporters' belief that the former reality star is an 'alpha male,' once saying the billionaire wears 'more makeup than Dolly Parton.' \n\n'Bautista, the old wrestler, did this skit on Trump being weak and all this stuff that I thought was disgusting and gross,' said White. 'Let me tell you what Bautista, and anybody else out there, the way that Trump reacted to that assassination, every man hopes that that's the way you would react. \n\n'If you reacted this much to how Trump reacted to that thing, you'd be happy.'\n\nA day ahead of Monday's closed-door ceremony in Washington DC , the country's once-and-future Commander in Chief is pictured alongside Rogan and White\n\nWhite recently spoke on Trump's behalf before the inauguration last month. \n\nHe focused the early part of his speech on Trump's 312-226 electoral college victory over Kamala Harris and his 1.5-percent edge in the popular vote.\n\n'Not only did he win the electoral college by 86 points, but President Trump was the first Republican candidate in 20 years to win the popular vote,' White continued. 'He also made tremendous gains among traditional Democrat voters by increasing his support with Latin, Asian-American, black and young voters. \n\n'So what does that tell us?' White asked, rhetorically. 'Democracy is alive and well in this country. And the people have spoke loud and clear: America wants President Trump back in the White House.'\n\nWhite also portrayed Trump as a hero for overcoming the media, legal system, and even an assassin's bullet during his campaign.\n\n'Think about this, winning this election after everything that's happened over the last few years is an amazing achievement and an incredible comeback story,' White said. 'Think of all the things President Trump had to go through to get back here, all the powerful forces that tried to take him down: the mainstream media, partisan prosecutors, assassins.\n\n'It's absolutely insane what this man has been through. And only President Trump could have fought through all those obstacles, all the attacks and still come out the winner.\n\n'But you know what?' White continued. 'That's just what he is. This guy is a winner. \n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk pose for a photo during the UFC 309\n\nWhite and Trump's fondness for each other is no secret. Trump has tapped the UFC President and CEO to speak for him at the last three Republican National Conventions, leading many to wonder if he'd serve a greater role in the White House at some point.\n\n'His base is Trump's base,' Kellyanne Conway, Trump's former White House counselor, previously told The New York Times of White. 'And Trump's base is his base.'\n\nWhite, however, has downplayed any potential Trump appointment.\n\n'Donald Trump is one of my very good friends,' White told Sports Business Journal through a spokesperson. 'He did a great job in his last term as president, and I know he will do an even better job the next four years. I have no personal political aspirations.'\n\nBesides, White may provide a greater service to Trump through what The New York Times calls 'cage-match politics.' Trump now makes regular cage-side appearances at UFC events, where fight fans — and the fighters themselves — have showered the former President with adulation.\n\nDonald TrumpUFC FightingDana White\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDana White begged Donald Trump to drop out of presidential race after assassination attempt, UFC boss reveals\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Dana White is thrilled to see his friend Donald Trump in the White House, but as the UFC President told Piers Morgan, he actually wanted the Republican candidate to drop out.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/mma/article-14356407/Dana-White-Donald-Trump-presidential-race-assassination-UFC.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/03/20/94821435-0-image-a-8_1738614557383.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/07/13/3827348296415331197/1024x576_MP4_3827348296415331197.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-03 20:55:45","author":"Alex Raskin,Editor","authors":["Alex Raskin","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.564},{"id":286750090,"title":"NFL Has Finally Regained Republicans favorability Lost Due To Kaepernick Kneeling Saga","text":"Ratings for the NFL declined precipitously in 2016 and 2017, ultimately leading to double-digit declines. There were people within the sports media who pushed back on the notion the declines were a response to Colin Kaepernick and other NFL players kneeling before the national anthem, purportedly in protest of the relationship between police officers and minority Americans. They were wrong. A new study from Morning Consult all but confirms politics was responsible for the decline. Specifically, a significant number of Republicans stopped watching the NFL in 2016 and 2017 but have since slowly returned (as kneeling has come to an end). Heading into the Super Bowl, the NFL finally regained the favorability that it lost among Republicans nearly 10 years ago. Favorability among Republicans and Democrats is now about equal, as shown below: Consequently, the NFL has set all-time viewership records in back-to-back Super Bowls, averaging 115 million and 124 million viewers in 2023 and 2024, respectively. If Sunday's Super Bowl between the Chiefs and Eagles is close (close games generally produce higher peaks and averages), the NFL could top its record for a third straight season. Hate for the Chiefs (and the refs) has brought Americans together, regardless of political affiliation. The NBA should take notice. Unlike the NFL, NBA players and coaches continue to use the space to espouse one-sided political messaging. Case in point: Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August in support of Kamala Harris. In 2020, a YouGov / Yahoo News poll found that nearly half of America changed its sports viewing habits and blamed political and social messaging for it. The study was primarily in reference to the NBA painting \"Black Lives Matter\" on the court to honor George Floyd. NBA viewership is down nearly 50% since 2012. Americans prefer sports to be an escapism, a distraction from the divisiveness of everyday American politics. The NFL understands that. Other leagues don't, including the WNBA. For the first time since its inception, the WNBA has transcended into the mainstream conversation (thanks to Caitlin Clark). Yet nasty mean girls like DiJonai Carrington are about to halt the league's movement by begging the league to take action against President Donald Trump. \"We see that some of the policies are already going into action, and, of course, that means that as the WNBA and being at the forefront of a lot of these movements, it's time for us to also take action. It definitely needs to happen as women, women's rights being taken away, like, now, LGBTQ rights being taken away now. They haven't happened yet, but definitely in the works,\" Carrington said prior to an Unrivaled league game Thursday. An American sports league has support from both conservatives and liberals to reach its highest possible ceiling of popularity. Apparently, the WNBA doesn't want that. By the way, given the Morning Consult, has one player ever negatively impacted a league more than Kaepernick did the NFL?","summary":"","url":"https://www.outkick.com/sports/nfl-has-finally-regained-republicans-favorability-lost-due-kaepernick-kneeling-saga","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/02/gettyimages-612051666.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-03 20:55:27","author":"Bobby Burack","authors":["Bobby Burack"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.097},{"id":286745412,"title":"Poll: Colorado voters say GOP more represents working class, address top concerns","text":"(The Center Square) – Colorado voters are waning in their support for the Democrat Party, a new poll finds, as immigration and the economy continue to be top concerns.\n\nThe Colorado Issues Poll, conducted by One Main Street Colorado, reported that 30% of those surveyed considered the economy and cost of living to have been their most important Election Day issue, while 24% said inflation.\n\nRepublicans drove those numbers, with 51% of supporters of President Donald listing the economy and 53% immigration. In contrast, only 12% of supporters of former Vice President Kamala listed the economy and 4% listed immigration.\n\nFor Democrats, their top issues included nearly even splits between anti-Trump, abortion, integrity, and democracy.\n\nThe poll also took a look at how voters view the Democrat Party, both in the state and in the national election.\n\nIn what could be concerning for Democrats, the majority of voters polled said that the Republican Party has done a better job of addressing inflation and the cost of living, understanding the challenges they are facing, and representing the middle class.\n\nAlong with that, 24% of voters said that Democrats lost key races on Election Day because they were “out of touch” with voters. Of Harris supporters, 27% identified “poor messaging” as the reason, while 35% of Trump supporters said the Democrats were out of touch.\n\nGoing forward, voters encouraged Democrats to focus on the economy and listening to voters, with an overwhelming 72% saying that the Democrat Party needs to recognize that most voters have legitimate concerns around immigration, taxation, the cost of living, etc.\n\nPotentially surprising for some, only 14% of voters said the Democrat Party should move to the left politically, while 27% said it should move to the right and 51% said it should “bridge the divide.”\n\nWhile Democrats hold a trifecta in Colorado, the poll still found that 51% of voters view the Colorado Democratic Party unfavorably.\n\nThis should especially be concerning as the 2024 General Election marked the first in the past decade that Republicans gained seats in the Colorado state House instead of losing them.\n\nThose polled encouraged state Democrats to focus on “reducing financial burdens on families and small businesses while creating opportunities for good paying jobs and building generational wealth,” over issues like rent controls, free healthcare, and a minimum basic income. The latter policy priorities have long been pet issues for Democratic politicians, both nationally and in Colorado.\n\nThe poll surveyed 1,225 active voters in Colorado. It had a margin of error of +/- 3.5%.","summary":"(The Center Square) – Colorado voters are waning in their support for the Democrat Party, a new poll finds, as immigration and the economy continue to be top concerns.","url":"https://www.guampdn.com/news/national/poll-colorado-voters-say-gop-more-represents-working-class-address-top-concerns/article_3e37f679-5fc3-5a7d-8c13-888f9976d4e6.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/guampdn.com/content/tncms/custom/image/d1d0565a-bcb2-11eb-8535-ab06d41ce483.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-03 20:15:00","author":"By Elyse Apel | The Center Square,One Main Street","authors":["By Elyse Apel | The Center Square","One Main Street"],"language":"en","source_country":"GU","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":286785634,"title":"Tesla Sales Drop 12% In California: Is Elon Musk's Support For Donald Trump Hurting EV Sales?","text":"Electric vehicle company Tesla Inc TSLA saw sales in California drop in 2024, just as they did across the U.S.\n\nThe sales drop begs the question: Is Tesla CEO Elon Musk‘s political support for President Donald Trump hurting the brand?\n\nWhat Happened: The U.S. sold a record 1.3 million electric vehicles in 2024, which is good news for the industry, but comes with market leader Tesla experiencing pressure and its first annual delivery decline.\n\nA new report shows that California, the biggest market for EVs in the U.S., has fewer registrations for Tesla models.\n\nData from the California New Car Dealers Association, as shared by Bloomberg, shows that Tesla's sales were down 12% in California in 2024 and down 8% in the fourth quarter. Tesla's sales were down in each of the four quarters of 2024, the report said.\n\nRegistrations for the Model 3 were down 36% year-over-year in 2024. Tesla's market share of zero-emission vehicles in the state went from 60.1% in 2023 to 52.5% in 2024. All of the company's vehicles, except the newly launched Cybertruck, had year-over-year declines in 2024.\n\nThe report said that the sales decline could be unusual given the addition of the Cybertruck to the vehicle lineup. Politics could be a factor.\n\nMusk spent at least $288 million trying to get Trump back to the White House.\n\nDemocratic nominee Kamala Harris won California by 20.2 points in the 2024 election. The strong Democratic base in the state may be less likely to support Tesla given Musk’s strong ties to the Trump White House.\n\nAre you buying when the CEOs of the Magnificent 7 are selling?\n\nStay in the know with our Insider Trades page — see when leaders like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Jensen Huang are offloading their own shares.\n\nWhy It's Important: Musk was once a California resident, and Tesla had its headquarters there. In recent years, he has lashed out at California and moved Tesla to Texas. He also clashed with Governor Gavin Newsom, which may also be putting pressure on Tesla's sales in the state.\n\nBenzinga previously reported that U.S. EV sales hit a record of 1.3 million in 2024. Tesla's market share, however, fell from 55% in 2023 to 48.7% in 2024.\n\nThe company's Model Y and Model 3 ranked as the top two bestselling EVs in the U.S. Both had sales drops of 6.6% and 17.4% respectively for the full year. The Cybertruck ranked fifth in the country with 38,965 unit sales.\n\nOverall in 2024, Tesla had 633,762 vehicles sold in the United States, which was down 5.6% year-over-year. Based on the new report, Tesla's sales are declining quicker in California than they are in the rest of the country.\n\nA report from Brand Finance found that Tesla's brand value was down $15 billion in 2024. The company went from 18th place for brand value in 2024 to 36th place in 2025.\n\nThe survey found that Tesla owners and other EV owners were less likely to recommend or consider buying a Tesla. This could be due to Musk's personal politics and outspoken political beliefs.\n\nThe sales reports and brand surveys continue to show a decline in both real sales and consumer ratings. This could suggest that Musk's politics are playing a role in how people see the brand and if they want to be associated with the company.\n\nPrice Action: Tesla stock is down 5.5% to $382.27 on Monday versus a 52-week trading range of $138.80 to $488.54. Tesla stock is up 111% over the last year.\n\nTesla Owners Who Don’t Like Musk Are Letting Bumper Stickers Do The Talking\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nTSLATesla Inc\n\n$389.50-3.73%\n\nOverview Rating:\n\nTechnicals Analysis\n\nFinancials Analysis\n\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy DANIEL BATES FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:18:56 GMT, 3 February 2025 |Updated:19:59 GMT, 3 February 2025 \n\nBlake Lively and Justin Baldoni's lawyers' tempers were rising in court Monday as both sides raised new allegations in their hotly contested case.\nBaldoni's attorney Bryan Freedman pleaded with the judge to move the case forward as quickly as possible because his client was 'suffering greatly'.\nBut Lively's lawyer Michael Gottlieb vehemently denied the claim that Lively was purposely dragging her heels in the lawsuit. \nJudge Lewis Liman denied a move from Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds to gag Team Baldoni following the series of bombshell claims made by his legal team.\nBut Gottlieb said they intend to hit Baldoni with fresh allegations in Lively's sexual harassment case, and insisted that protecting the couple's celebrity friends was going to be 'very important'. \nGottlieb told the court during the hearing that they intend to add 'both claims and parties' to a revised complaint which will be filed by Valentine's Day. \n\nBlake Lively and Justin Baldoni's lawyers tempers are rising in court this morning as both sides raise new allegations, DailyMail.com can reveal\n\nFreedman said that the defamation case Baldoni filed against the New York Times in California would be dismissed \n\nDuring the hearing, Gottlieb attacked Freedman for making statements outside of court which had challenged the ‘character, integrity and truthfulness’ of Lively\nThe move came after Baldoni updated his own complaint in his $400 million defamation case against the Gossip Girl star which accused Lively of giving The New York Times advanced access to her complaint of sexual harassment during the filming of the movie It Ends With Us.\nGottlieb attacked Freedman for making statements outside of court which had challenged the ‘character, integrity and truthfulness’ of Lively.\nAfter complaining, Lively's lawyers were told was that 'we (Lively) started it' with the New York Times article, Gottlieb said.\nGottlieb cited an interview in People magazine in which Freedman accused Lively of a ‘pattern of bullying’.\nIn another statement Freedman claimed that if Lively really was sexually harassed she wouldn't have returned to the film.\nA skeptical Judge Liman said: 'isn’t that what’s stated in his complaint?'\n\nFreedman fired back that the statements had 'not been a one way street' and tried to walk the court through a number made by Lively's lawyers \n\nGottlieb cited an interview People magazine in which Freedman accused Lively of a ‘pattern of bullying’ \nGottlieb said no and that lawyers were 'not supposed to launch attacks on another party’s character'.\nHe added that the leaking of raw footage from It Ends With Us was 'particularly concerning' because it could start an 'arms race' whereby lawyers have to appear in the media to fire back at every disclosure.\n'If there’s no guard rails in place….we (the attorneys) have to and go out on shows arguing on shows what a particular document or video means'.\nFreedman fired back that the statements had 'not been a one way street' and tried to walk the court through a number made by Lively's lawyers.\nAfter listening to them, Judge Liman said Freedman 'went a little bit further' than Lively's lawyers.\nThe judge said that he was adopting rules for lawyers known as Rule 3.6 which bars both of them from making extrajudicial statements that could influence the jury.\n\nGottlieb added that the leaking of raw footage from The Ends With Us was 'particularly concerning' because it could start an 'arms race' whereby lawyers have to appear in the media to fire back at every disclosure\nJudge Liman said he was 'hesitant to adopt it' but after both sides agreed to it, he changed his mind.\nHe said: 'My expectation is the parties will comply with their ethical obligations. I don't expect this case to devolve into satellite litigation over the comments of a lawyer.\n'Both have said a lot in the pleadings that give the public plenty to feast upon'.\nFreedman tried to protest and said: 'Not to sound like a four year old fighting a four year old with 'but they started it' but once someone says something it becomes fact, there’s no way to fight against it.\n'You start to lose things without the ability to have the court’s adjudication. This was not started by us.'\nJudge Liman also warned that if both sides didn't behave themselves he could move the date of the trial forward from March next year.\n\nJudge Liman also warned that if both sides didn't behave themselves he could move the date of the trial forward from March next year \nHe said: 'I’m not going to do that, I’m convinced the parties need the time for discovery.\n'But if it turns out that this ends up being litigated in the press in a way that would prejudice the opportunity of a fair trial…one of the tools the court has is to accelerate the date of the trial.\n'That’s something that is out there. I don’t want to do that.'\nEarlier in the hearing, Gottlieb, who also represents Reynolds, said that he would be seeking a protective order through the court for future filings to protect the couple's celebrity friends.\nWhile he did not name Taylor Swift, she would likely be one of those affected as she was referred to in Baldoni's complaint.\nGottlieb said: 'We do believe there will be provisions in a protective order that will be appropriate in this case given the nature of the allegations and the high profile nature of some of the individuals who will be involved.\n\nBlake Lively allegedly leveraged her friendship with superstar Taylor Swift to get her way behind the scenes of It Ends With Us, according to Justin Baldoni; pictured February 2024\n\nBaldoni claimed Lively threatened to 'change her mind' about reaching out to pal Taylor to secure the use of her hit 2020 track My Tears Ricochet\n'There is a significant number of high profile individuals on both sides.\n'In particular addressing the interests and needs of third parties is going to be very important in this case.'\nGottlieb said he would plan to 'seek protections we believe will be very important particularly in a case where there's been a significant amount of leaking materials'. \nHe said: 'We do intend to propose a protective order in this case.'\nJudge Liman agreed and said that even before the other parties were named 'you already got a lot of high profile people' involved.\nBaldoni's lawyer Bryan Freedman said he would be prepared to agree to the order.\nGottlieb also talked about discovery and how there will be a significant amount about how Baldoni and the other defendants used the media to 'shape and push forward' their retaliation strategy.\nHe also talked about finding material on 'individuals who may have been paid for taking certain positions in public'.\n\nFreedman, who represents Baldoni and his PR team, asked the judge in todays first court hearing to move the case forward as quickly as possible because his clients were 'suffering greatly'. \nThis came after Blake Lively's lawyer said their team intends to hit Justin Baldoni with fresh allegations in her sexual harassment case.\nFreedman told the court: 'We would really urge the court to allow discovery to take place and move forward because the harms are being suffered and have been suffered since the New York Times article came out.'\nFreedman said that Wayfair had lost 'hundreds of millions of dollars' and that Melissa Nathan, Baldoni's PR during the crisis over the movie, had lost clients.\nHe said: 'When things hit the press, especially The New York Times, people sometimes react before there's a judicial determination. These parties are suffering greatly.\n'It’s so important from our client’s perspective of having a future livelihood to move forward as quickly as possible.'\n\nThe decision to publish the site on Saturday comes after Baldoni amended his $400 million suit accusing Lively of giving The New York Times advance access to her sexual harassment complaint\n\nFreedman said that the defamation case Baldoni filed against the New York Times in California would be dismissed. The matter would proceed through the New York cases because the newspaper had been added as a defendant in Baldoni's case. \nJudge Liman said the two cases filed in New York by Baldoni and Lively against each other had been combined.\nFreedman later returned to the harm on Baldoni and his team were 'devastated financially and emotionally and need the case to move as quickly as it can'.\nBut Judge Liman appeared irate as he asked Freedman why he had filed a 168 page timeline of the case with his updated complaint.\nThe judge said it seemed like the kind of thing that the 'rules were designed to prevent'.\n'You can’t just give me a complaint and give me a whole bunch of documents', the judge said.\n\nThe film at the heart of the feud, based on the 2016 bestseller by Colleen Hoover, was released in August and was a box office hit. It follows Lily Bloom, a florist played by Lively, who falls in love with a charming but abusive neurosurgeon played by Baldoni\n\nJudge Liman asked: 'What is the purpose of that attachment?' \nFreedman claimed that it 'formed the basis' of the underlying claims.\nTensions rose as Gottlieb said that he would seek the document struck from the case.\nHe said that Freedman's description of the material was 'not accurate'.\nGottlieb said there were 'lengthy paragraphs' in a voice that wasn't clear who was speaking and there was 'no way' for them to respond.\nHe also rejected the idea that Lively was dragging their heels.\n\nBaldoni's legal fight with Lively began after she sued him for sexual harassment just days before Christmas\n\nA letter filed on Monday points out Freedman's recent media appearances as well as a report of a new website being created by Baldoni's team to 'strategically release selected documents and communications' between the two feuding co-stars\nHe said that 'our clients have been subject since August to an ongoing campaign of retaliation for reporting sexual harassment', adding that it had been 'devastating' for Lively and 'continues to this day'. \nGottlieb said: 'That harm has made our client very eager to move forward and have her day in court.'\nJudge Liman rejected the idea that Gottlieb could stop Freedman from being the lawyer who conducted Lively's deposition.\nThe judge said that 'I don't think that's going to happen' and that Gottlieb wouldn't be the one to decide.\nThe now denied gag order was originally sent in a letter to the judge presiding over the case on January 27, the couple's attorney requested a conference to highlight their 'growing concerns' over what they describe as lawyer Bryan Freedman's alleged 'extrajudicial misconduct'.\nThe filing, obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com, cited Freedman's recent media appearances as well as a report of a new website being created by Baldoni's team to 'strategically release selected documents and communications' between the two feuding co-stars.\n\nJustin Baldoni launched his own website dedicated to defending himself against Blake Lively 's sexual harassment allegations\n\n Justin Baldoni publishes explosive new website telling 'his side' of Blake Lively lawsuit \nThe It Ends with Us co-stars were not obliged to attend the 11am pretrial conference in New York which marks the first step in their dueling $400 million defamation suits.\nThe 37-year-old actress has complained bitterly about Freedman making 'harassing and retaliatory' comments about her to the media and wants Judge Lewis Liman to silence the outspoken super lawyer.\nHer mood will likely not have improved after Team Baldoni followed through Saturday with a pledge to upload new details of their headline-spewing legal fight to a specially created website.\nThelawsuitinfo.com went live with links to an amended version of Baldoni's complaint and a 'timeline of relevant events' charting how the explosive feud developed during filming for their 2024 adaptation of Colleen Hoover's acclaimed novel.\nThe cache includes surprising evidence that Lively's Hollywood actor husband Ryan Reynolds seemed to like Baldoni before their relationship soured, texting him to say: 'I'm excited for Blake to crack open her creative piggy bank with someone as dynamic as you … I happen to adore you, Justin.'\nAnother eye-popping message from Lively to 41-year-old Baldoni, discussing the script for the movie's pivotal rooftop scene, reads: 'If you knew me (in person) longer you'd have a sense of how flirty and yummy the ball busting will be.\n\nText exchanges between Reynolds and Baldoni have been included in the lawsuit. In this set of messages, Reynolds thanks the movie's director and praises him for being a 'wonderful collaborator'\n\nText messages from Reynolds reiterate how much their family adores Baldoni and how grateful they are for him working around Lively's schedule\n\n'It's my love language. Spicy and playfully bold, never with teeth.'\nWhat Judge Liman, a Trump appointee, makes of Team Baldoni's latest PR power move remains to be seen.\nBut Freedman and his co-counsel will argue that the two uploaded documents were merely published court filings already available to the public via the federal government's Pacer website.\n'It's important to point out that nobody is monetizing off this. It's simply a landing page to have access to legal documents that are already public,' a source told DailyMail.com.\n'This is far from a provocation. In fact, it's yet more evidence that Justin and his team intend to be continually transparent.'\nJudge Liman will also be asked to decide whether Freedman – a bulldog showbiz lawyer whose previous clients include Megyn Kelly, Tucker Carlson and Julia Roberts – should be allowed to grill Lively under oath on behalf of Baldoni and his production company, Wayfarer Studios.\n'Counsel for Ms. Lively and Ryan Reynolds stated their objection to the Wayfarer Parties' lead counsel conducting the deposition of Blake Lively,' Baldoni attorney Kevin Fritz wrote to the court Friday.\n'Specifically, the Lively Parties' counsel indicated that they object to Bryan J. Freedman personally, taking Ms Lively's deposition, based upon unspecified statements made by Mr. Freedman.'\nFritz said the move was unwarranted, adding: 'Parties to litigation simply do not have the right to dictate which of their opponents' attorneys may or may not take their deposition.'\nJustin BaldoniBlake LivelyNew York Times\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nTempers flare as Blake Lively's lawyers reject idea she's purposely delaying case while Justin Baldoni's lawyer pleads for swift resolution\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nEXCLUSIVEKanye West in shock as his naked Grammys stunt with Bianca Censori costs him $20million Tokyo gigs\n\nUna Healy 'SPLITS from Aidan Coleman' just months after going public with their romance - and the retired jockey has already 'moved on'\n\nCharlotte Crosby reveals the name of her adorable baby girl after she confirmed the arrival of her second child with fiancé Jake Ankers\n\nEXCLUSIVEDonald Trump fan Petra Ecclestone reveals plans to relocate to the Middle East to escape 'gun crime and crack smoking' in LA \n\nEXCLUSIVETempers fly as Blake Lively's lawyers reject idea she's purposely delaying case while Justin Baldoni's lawyer pleads for resolution\n\nSomething for everyone!

I care about Hispanics. I care about Spanish people. I care about Mexicans… I care about gay people,” they continued. “I used to think he was cool, but now you look like a motherfucking fool… Fuck you, n—a. Get a new attitude… I might be a little tipsy but I know everything I’m motherfucking saying. Fuck you, Nelly!”\n\n A rep for Nelly did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.\n\n The Monáe diss comes several weeks after Nelly defended his decision to perform during the presidential inauguration event, saying he would’ve agreed to play even if Kamala Harris or Joe Biden won the election.\n\n “I respect the office. This isn’t politics. Politics for me is over; [Trump] won, he’s the Commander-in-Chief,” he said in a podcast interview, later adding: “I love this country as well. It is an honor for me to perform for the President of the United States, regardless of who is in office.”\n\n Monáe previously endorsed Harris in a November interview with Bossip, slamming Trump’s policy stances and rhetoric: ”He’s a hateful person and he wants the rest of the world to exhibit that behavior and that is dangerous. Kamala is about ‘we,’ where Trump is about ‘me.’ That’s the clear difference.”\n\n Monáe appeared at the 2025 Grammys Sunday night, performing Michael Jackson’s “Don’t Stop Til You Get Enough” during a tribute to Quincy Jones.","summary":"\"I care about women.

We are profoundly honored to partner with him again.” \n\n Lovett, along with fellow co-chairs Bryan Lourd and Kevin Huvane, have been among Hollywood’s prominent backers of Biden and Kamala Harris’ re-election campaign as well as other Democratic candidates.\n\n The Century City-based mega agency already reps his White House predecessor, Barack and Michelle Obama’s Higher Ground Productions, as well as Democratic-leaning pols like Joe Manchin, Susan Rice, Beto O’Rourke and many others across the aisle as part of its speakers bureau.\n\n And the move for the Delaware politician marks a homecoming for Biden and the agency, which had repped him during his post-vice presidential wilderness years from 2017 through his 2020 victory over Donald Trump. In that time, Biden published a book, Promise Me, Dad, reflecting on his eldest son Beau’s battle with cancer, as well as embarked on a nationwide paid tour.\n\n Biden formally oversaw the transition of power on Jan. 20 to the second Trump administration and hasn’t yet unveiled typical post-presidential moves like a book deal or speaking gigs (or any sort of first-look or streaming deal).\n\n Days earlier he gave a farewell TV interview to Lawrence O’Donnell at MSNBC in the Oval Office that highlighted his concern about the state of democracy stateside. “I really am concerned about how fragile democracy is. That sounds corny,” he said. “But I mean, I really, really am concerned, because you’ve heard me say it 100 times, I really think we’re in an inflection point in history here.”\n\n The Democratic party, however, is focused on determining their identity without Biden or Harris as its standard bearers. On Feb. 1, the Democratic National Committee picked Minnesotan Ken Martin as its next chair to lead the party as Trump takes power.","summary":"As he kicks off his post-presidential era, the Delaware politician has inked with the Century City-based mega agency.","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/joe-biden-is-ready-to-make-some-hollywood-deals-signs-with-caa-1236126286/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/BidenGettyImages-2162013738.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-03 19:48:39","author":"Erik Hayden","authors":["Erik Hayden"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.203},{"id":286732800,"title":"Nightmare nurse Erin Strotman accused of breaking babies' legs said she 'felt like a psycho' and admitted using cocaine and Xanax","text":"Black Friday\n\nBreaking News\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nPrince Harry\n\nKing Charles III\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Feb 3rd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKanye West in shock as his naked Grammys stunt with Bianca Censori costs him $20million Tokyo gigs after rapper 'greatly misjudged the tolerance of the Japanese people'\n\nSir Keir Starmer says the 'whole country' will mourn with family of 15-year-old who died after being stabbed at secondary school in Sheffield - as boy, 15, is arrested\n\nHow Kate Middleton is passing her passion for photography to her children - as six-year-old Prince Louis captures his mother in sweet new portrait for World Cancer Day\n\nTrump tariffs will spark price rises on astonishing array of products\n\nI ordered an iPad for my daughter for Christmas - you won't believe what Currys sent me instead\n\nThe 'Ozempic for alcohol': It's the pill that can stop you reaching for a bottle of wine just as fat jabs stop you craving food - and now experts say it should be widely prescribed on the NHS\n\nMoment Chelsea striker Sam Kerr calls Met Police officer 'stupid and white' is shown in court after taxi driver accused her and her partner of refusing to pay when one of them was sick\n\nWhat Trump's trade war means for YOU: As the President's tariffs throw markets into turmoil, read our expert's advice on what British investors should do to protect themselves\n\nLosing weight on fat jabs like Mounjaro or Ozempic?

In January, she told a friend that going back to work was a mistake\n\nEXCLUSIVE Shocking court documents reveal how nurse Erin Strotman was caught on camera breaking baby's leg \nWhen discussing her suspension with another friend, Strotman said: 'I should've left the first time this stuff happened instead of staying.\n'I really should've listened to everyone when they told me to get out of this situation.\n'Because if I did leave with everyone else I wouldn't be in this situation.'\nStrotman is facing up to 20 years in prison for malicious wounding and ten for child abuse – a possible total sentence of 30 years behind bars if a judge chooses to make them run concurrently.\nA police report obtained by DailyMail.com also revealed the shocking details of how Strotman allegedly broke the legs of babies in her care.\nStrotman took the boy – identified only as Y.H. – by the legs and then applied pressure to them, wrote Detective Megan Lynch.\n'Ms. Strotman was observed to be placing her weight down on the legs of Y.H.' added Lynch.\n'Ms. Strotman was observed then taking both legs and pushing them backwards to where Y.H.'s feet were at his head.\n\nOfficials confirmed that the injuries discovered this year were 'similar to an incident involving four babies in the summer of 2023', with Henrico County Police reviewing 'dozens of videos' from inside the unit \n\nThe documents showed that after Strotman placed her weight on his legs, the baby was 'crying and in distress' as she 'moved the left leg back and forth' - the footage allegedly showed the left leg moved normally, but the right did not\n\nThe incidents took place in the NICU unit at Henrico Doctors' Hospital. They later installed 'angel cameras' which court documents alleged caught Strotman carrying out the heinous act\n\n'Y.H. looked to be crying and in distress,' the detective wrote, noting that the boy's left leg moved normally but the right did not.'\nThe hospital announced on Christmas Eve that it would not be 'admitting any additional babies into our NICU at this time' after three babies were found with the fractures in late November and December.\nOfficials confirmed that the injuries discovered this year were 'similar to an incident involving four babies in the summer of 2023', with Henrico County Police reviewing 'dozens of videos' from inside the unit.\nDetectives are re-examining the 2023 and 2024 cases as part of the broader investigation.\nDetails of how Strotman allegedly injured the boy comes after sources close to the hospital told DailyMail.com that she was 'racist' and initially targeted only black children.\nBut her lawyer told DailyMail.com that there was no truth to the allegations made by fellow staff members that she had deliberately targeted black children.\nJeff Everhart said that he had not seen any of the evidence against his client in the case yet and was currently focusing on getting her bond.\n'We're still in the early stages, in a bit of a legal limbo at the moment', he told DailyMail.com.\n\nCoworkers and former classmates of Strotman told DailyMail.com they suspected she was 'racist' and they were 'not surprised that it was her' \n\nNoah was one of seven babies who suffered inexplicable injuries at Henrico Doctors' Hospital in Richmond, Virginia from 2023 to 2024\n\nStrotman's lawyer said they're working on getting her out on bond so she can be reunited with her family but the judge said they wanted a psychological examination before the decision \n'She's safe, we would be happier if she was out on bail with her family. But the judge wanted a little more insight into her mental state so we're working to get that.'\nStrotman remains in custody after her court appearance on January 22, when she attempted to appeal her bond for a second time.\nNo decision was made because the judge ruled that a psychological examination should be performed beforehand. \nHer next appearance in court will be on February 11.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNightmare nurse Erin Strotman accused of breaking babies' legs said she 'felt like a psycho' and admitted using cocaine and Xanax\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nEXCLUSIVEKanye West in shock as his naked Grammys stunt with Bianca Censori costs him $20million Tokyo gigs\n\nUna Healy 'SPLITS from Aidan Coleman' just months after going public with their romance - and the retired jockey has already 'moved on'\n\nCharlotte Crosby reveals the name of her adorable baby girl after she confirmed the arrival of her second child with fiancé Jake Ankers\n\nPregnant Michelle Keegan enjoys stunning surprise 'baby shower' with her Northern friends in Cheshire as she prepares for the arrival of her first child \n\nEXCLUSIVETempers fly as Blake Lively's lawyers reject idea she's purposely delaying case while Justin Baldoni's lawyer pleads for resolution\n\nSomething for everyone!

In this role, Musk co-chairs the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), aimed at streamlining government operations. The billionaire has been provided with an official government email and office space but reportedly receives no salary for his work.\nPresident Donald Trump commended Musk for his cost-cutting abilities, stating, “I think Elon is doing a good job. He’s a big cost-cutter. Sometimes we won’t agree with it, but I think he’s doing a great job.” The president approved Musk's appointment after returning from a weekend in Florida.\nFinancial Contributions to Trump's Campaign\nFresh documents from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) reveal that Musk spent over $290 million in 2024 to support Trump's presidential campaign against Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.\nDemocrats have voiced concerns over Musk’s influence within the federal government, suggesting potential conflicts of interest given his company, SpaceX, holds multi-billion-dollar contracts with the government. Critics fear Musk may be consolidating power without adequate accountability.\nThe applicability of standard ethical rules and financial disclosure requirements for Musk remains unclear. A White House official confirmed that Musk was adhering to legal requirements but did not provide further details.\nDemocratic Fears Over Musk-Trump Agenda\nDemocrats have warned that Musk’s leadership at DOGE could undermine traditional federal agencies. They also fear that dismantling USAID, as reportedly planned by Trump and Musk, could weaken the United States' global influence, allowing China to fill the void.\nAs Musk continues his tenure as a special government employee, questions remain about transparency, ethics, and the balance of power in federal operations.

[+] 2023.\nAnadolu Agency\n\nMusk said on an X Spaces conversation early Monday he “went over” the “USAID stuff” with Trump and “[the president] agreed that we should shut it down,” after Trump told reporters Sunday about USAID, “It’s been run by a bunch of radical lunatics, and we’re getting them out, and then we’ll make a decision [about its future].”\n\nUSAID is the primary federal agency providing foreign aid to countries around the world, and has been under siege by the Trump administration in recent days amid rumors Trump wants to move it under the State Department, with staff being cut, its website shut down and Trump freezing nearly all foreign aid, while staffers from Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) already accessing and scrutinizing the agency’s classified data.\n\nMusk and other Trump officials have claimed USAID is staffed by Democrats and supports left-wing causes, with Musk repeatedly criticizing the agency on social media and claiming in his X Spaces conversation Monday the agency is “incredibly politically partisan” and has supported “radically left causes throughout the world including things that are anti-American.”\n\nTrump advisor Stephen Miller also claimed on CNN that “98%” of the agency’s staff donated to former Vice President Kamala Harris or other Democratic candidates in the November election, while Trump’s envoy for special missions Richard Grenell claimed former USAID head Samantha Power “used [taxpayer] money to fund crazy radical programs and far Left activists” and State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce posted a thread of what she called “unjustified” foreign aid spending.\n\nNeither the claims of USAID staffers donating to Democrats or “radical” funding have proven true, and other GOP claims also have been debunked, such as the Trump administration’s claim the agency sent $50 million worth of condoms to Gaza.\n\nWhy Is Usaid Controversial With Trump, Musk And Other Republicans?\n\nThe agency has funded groups on issues that Republicans and the Trump administration now deem to be controversial, noting a focus on “equity and inclusion” and LGBTQ rights initiatives in its 2024 annual report. The Trump administration has taken a hardline stance against “DEI” programs and transgender rights initiatives and sought to eliminate them from the federal government. USAID said it also worked with dozens of countries on climate change mitigation efforts last year and mobilized $16.7 billion in outside funding on climate change, while Trump has broadly tried to cut Biden-era climate programs and get rid of government programs on renewable energy.\n\nDid Usaid Fund Covid 19 “lab Leak”?\n\nA charge that’s been leveled at USAID, which Musk amplified Monday, is that the agency sent funds to EcoHealth Alliance, a medical research group that’s been targeted by proponents of the theory that COVID 19 originated in a lab in Wuhan, China. USAID has given EcoHealth Alliance funding, with the health organization noting on its website the agency established an “Emerging Pandemic Threats” program that seeks to identify emerging diseases that could spread from animals to humans. While the National Institutes of Health has previously raised some concerns with EcoHealth Alliance for failing to properly disclose information, there’s no evidence linking the group’s work to the COVID 19 pandemic. Robert Kessler, a spokesperson for the organization, told The New York Times in 2021 that none of the viruses EcoHealth has studied are similar enough to the virus behind COVID-19 to suggest they played a role in the virus’ origins.\n\nDid Usaid Spend $50 Million On Condoms In Gaza?\n\nNo. Trump and his administration have claimed the Biden administration spent $50 million on “condoms in Gaza,” with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt calling the expenditure a “preposterous waste of taxpayer money” and using it to justify the Trump administration’s freeze on foreign aid. Trump even ramped up the accuations Monday, telling reporters Musk had found evidence of $100 million worth of condoms going to Hamas. There is no evidence to support the White House’s claims. The Washington Post notes the Biden-era State Department signed a $50 million deal for healthcare in Gaza but that did not include supplying any condoms, and while USAID did send $60.8 million in contraception and condoms to other countries in fiscal year 2023, none of those shipments were sent to Gaza. The first Trump administration also sent contraception and condoms abroad through USAID, the News Literacy Project first noted, sending $51.5 million worth of contraceptives in 2018 and $39.1 million in 2019.\n\nWhat Does Usaid Spend Its Funds On?\n\nUSAID spent more than $43 billion in fiscal year 2023 providing aid to approximately 130 countries, according to the Congressional Research Service. The biggest recipient of USAID’s funding has been Ukraine, which CRS noted has received more than $46 billion since its war with Russia began in February 2022, followed by Ethiopia, Jordan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Nigeria, South Sudan, and Syria. The agency’s mission has consistently received bipartisan support in the past, and The Washington Post noted in 2017 military leaders also view the agency as essential because it helps to prevent foreign wars that the U.S. could otherwise have to step in to help with. USAID provides funding to combat issues like poverty and disease, as well as provides strategic assistance for foreign conflicts and supports developing countries’ economic growth. Former officials with the agency have suggested cuts to its funding will impact ongoing issues like international Ebola outbreaks, the bird flu epidemic and worldwide HIV treatment and prevention.\n\nHas Usaid Done Anything Wrong?\n\nTrump officials and Musk’s concerns about USAID are primarily based on partisan concerns, rather than any actual wrongdoing by the agency. The Office of the Inspector General that oversees USAID has said in recent reports the agency does have some room for improvement, citing issues with ensuring the United Nations and other organizations inform USAID of any misconduct within the groups its funding, failures by the UN and other groups to provide the inspector general’s office with information to help its investigations, and jurisdiction issues making it hard for USAID to sue any foreign organizations that misuse its funds. The inspector general also argued USAID needs a better system to identify whether the groups it’s funding have any ties to terrorist groups or “corrupt actors,” after House Republicans expressed concern in 2023 that the agency’s humanitarian aid being sent to Gaza could be sent to groups with ties to Hamas.\n\nDid Usaid Fund Al-Qaida-Affiliated Terrorist Groups?\n\nNo—a non-governmental organization allegedly stole from USAID. Federal prosecutors, including USAID’s inspector general’s office, brought criminal charges in November against a Syrian national who allegedly diverted $9 million from a $122 million USAID humanitarian aid program meant to combat hunger in Syria but was sent to combatant groups aligned with al-Qaida.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nAnonymous USAID officials cited by PBS News report while the Trump administration is now reportedly targeting officials at USAID who work on gender-focused programs, much of that work originated during the first Trump administration, when Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump created a Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative.\n\nMusk’s attacks on USAID have been praised by the Russian government, with deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia Dmitry Medvedev—a former Russian president and ally of current President Vladimir Putin—saying on X Monday, “Smart move by @elonmusk, trying to plug USAID's Deep Throat.”\n\nCan Trump Get Rid Of Usaid?\n\nIt remains to be seen what actions Trump will take on USAID, but since Congress passed a federal statute declaring it an independent agency, the president can’t unilaterally close it or move it to be under the State Department. That isn’t to say Trump could still try to close it himself anyway, however—regardless of whether doing so would be legal—though that’s likely to result in lawsuits from humanitarian groups or Democratic lawmakers. Some anonymous USAID officials suggested to Politico Trump could try to intentionally keep any orders he issues on the agency “vague” in order to avoid accusations that he’s unlawfully shuttering it without congressional approval.\n\nKey Background\n\nUSAID has emerged as one of Trump and his officials’ biggest targets in the early days of his second term, with the president and Musk attacking the agency as critics had already feared Trump would try to get rid of government agencies if elected. The attacks on USAID come after Trump reportedly previously tried to move the agency to be under the State Department during his first term, which Politico notes ultimately failed due to bipartisan opposition to the move. Trump and his administration have issued a slew of orders in the first weeks of Trump’s presidency seeking to reshape the federal government to be in line with his ideological goals, and the freeze on foreign aid came right before the Trump administration tried to halt nearly all federal assistance—a move that it soon had to walk back, and was later blocked in court. Trump has sought to pause federal spending in order to conduct “reviews” of whether money is going to causes he supports, even when those funds have already been approved by Congress, which Democrats warn he doesn’t have the authority to do.\n\nFurther Reading\nForbesUSAID Controversy Live Updates: Marco Rubio Named Acting Administrator—After Elon Musk Says Trump ‘Agreed’ To Shut It DownBy Siladitya Ray\nForbesWhat To Know About Trump’s USAID Changes—After Elon Musk’s DOGE Accesses Classified InfoBy Alison Durkee\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

Surprisingly, it doesn’t even include the stunt he pulled at the 2025 Grammys.\n\nOn Saturday, the first day of Black History Month, Ye posted several disturbing and inappropriate tweets about everything under the sun, most notably Kamala Harris. While many of the posts are still up on his profile, the most disrespectful ones have been deleted.\n\nThe next day, during a post-grammy interview with Justin LaBoy, West continued his insane behavior and continued to utter some insane statements. With that in mind, let’s catch you up on some of the craziest things West said over the weekend.\n\nHe said what about Kamala Harris?!\n\nDuring his long-winded rant on X, the post that caught most users attention was a tweet that read, “I used to want to f**k Kamala until she loss. I don’t f**k losers anymore.”\n\nImplying that because Harris lost the presidential election to Trump, Harris is no longer attractive.\n\nFollowing the pushback from the post, West eventually deleted and wrote in a separate tweet, “The democrats made me take the loser post down. Naw I’m kidding. Dey don’t control black people no more. Trump 4 life.”\n\nHe later added, “Kamala seems like a very nice human I just wanna say sorry to her kids.”\n\nTrump praise\n\nSince West is no longer interested in being a politician, he’s back to his old ways of supporting Donald Trump, like he was during the 2016 Presidential election.\n\nIn one tweet he wrote, “Trumps back in office. Ye’s back a billionaire. The world might just be ok.”\n\nWhile it’s true that Trump is back in office, there hasn’t been a reliable source to confirm that Ye has reached billionaire status again.\n\nF**k anyone who can read?\n\nYe also took a shot at anyone who is literate, writing in a post, “F**k reading and anyone who can do it.”\n\nAccording to the National Literacy Institute, 79% of adults in the United States can read. Meaning that West hates almost the entire country, including himself since it’s clear he can also read as well.\n\nCan Drake come back?\n\nGetting away from his long-winded rant on X, West was interviewed by Justin LaBoy Sunday night during a post-Grammy Party, where he finally gave his thoughts on the battle between Kendrick Lamar and Drake.\n\nWhen LaBoy asked, “So Kendrick killed Drake? He’s dead.” In response, Ye said, “Yeah, for now. You can’t ever count out Steph Curry [Drake]. That man might get 200 points in one song.”\n\nHe later added that Lamar, “Took down my nemesis for me.”\n\nDrake and Ye have had issues for a long time, going back to his 2018 beef with Pusha T. Although they seemed to squash their problems in December 2021 during the Free Larry Hoover Benefit Concert, their feud continued in the years that followed.","summary":"Kanye West is back to his old ways of saying and doing the most insane things possible to gain some attention before releasing his next studio album.

Sorprendentemente, ni siquiera incluye truco que hizo en los Grammy 2025.\n\nEl sábado, primer día de Mes de la Historia AfroamericanaPublicaste varios tuits perturbadores e inapropiados sobre todo lo que existe bajo el sol, en particular Kamala HarrisAunque muchas de las publicaciones aún están en su perfil, las más irrespetuosas han sido eliminadas.\n\nAl día siguiente, durante una entrevista posterior a los Grammy con Justin LaBoy, West continuó con su comportamiento insano y continuó pronunciando algunas declaraciones insanas.\n\nCon eso en mente, pongámonos al día con algunas de las cosas más locas que dijo West durante el fin de semana.\n\nÉl dijo ¿qué pasa con Kamala Harris?\n\nDurante su extenso discurso sobre X, la publicación que más llamó la atención de los usuarios fue un tuit que decía: “Solía querer follarme a Kamala hasta que ella perdiera. Ya no me follo a perdedores”.Lo que implica que debido a que Harris perdió las elecciones presidenciales ante Trump\n\nHarris ya no es atractivo.\n\nTras el rechazo a la publicación, West finalmente la borró y escribió en un tuit aparte: “Los demócratas me hicieron eliminar la publicación del perdedor. No, estoy bromeando. Ya no controlan a la gente negra. Trump de por vida”.\n\nLuego agregó: “Kamala parece una persona muy agradable. Solo quiero pedirle perdón a sus hijos”.\n\nElogios a Trump\n\nComo West ya no está interesado en ser político, ha vuelto a sus viejas costumbres de apoyar a Donald Trump, como lo hizo durante las elecciones presidenciales de 2016.\n\nEn un tuit escribió: “Trump está de nuevo en el cargo. Vuelve a ser multimillonario. El mundo podría estar bien”.\n\nSi bien es cierto que Trump está de regreso en el cargo, no ha habido una fuente confiable que confirme que Ye haya alcanzado nuevamente el estatus de multimillonario.\n\n¿A alguien que sepa leer le joden?\n\nYe también se dirigió a cualquiera que sepa leer y escribir, escribiendo en una publicación: “A la mierda con la lectura y con cualquiera que pueda hacerlo”.Según el Instituto Nacional de Alfabetización\n\nEl 79% de los adultos en Estados Unidos saben leer, lo que significa que West odia a casi todo el país, incluido él mismo, ya que está claro que también sabe leer.\n\n¿Podrá Drake regresar?Alejándose de su larga perorata sobre X, West fue entrevistado por Justin LaBoy el domingo por la noche durante una fiesta posterior a los Grammy, donde finalmente dio sus pensamientos sobre la batalla entre Kendrick Lamar\n\nCuando LaBoy preguntó: «¿Entonces Kendrick mató a Drake? Está muerto». En respuesta, Ye dijo: «Sí, por ahora. Nunca puedes descartar a Steph Curry [Drake]. Ese hombre podría obtener 200 puntos en una canción».\n\nMás tarde añadió que Lamar “derrotó a mi némesis por mí”.Drake y Ye han tenido problemas durante mucho tiempo, desde su pelea de 2018 con Pusha T. Aunque parecieron solucionar sus problemas en diciembre de 2021 durante la Concierto benéfico gratuito de Larry Hoover","summary":"Kanye West está de vuelta a sus viejas maneras de decir y hacer las cosas más insanables posibles para ganar algo de atención antes de lanzar su próximo álbum de estudio.

In October, Trump filed a $10 billion lawsuit against CBS News alleging election interference over its handling of the \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing the network of aiding his Democratic rival through deceptive editing. Trump’s camp has said CBS essentially aired Harris giving two different answers to the same question, which raised eyebrows after her first answer was widely mocked as a \"word salad.\" Critics accused CBS News of editing Harris' \"word salad\" answer to shield the vice president from further backlash. CBS announced on Friday it would comply and provide the FCC \"with the transcript and camera feeds from a ‘60 Minutes’ interview at the center of a complaint alleging news distortion.\" TRUMP SUES CBS NEWS FOR $10 BILLION ALLEGING 'DECEPTIVE DOCTORING' OF HARRIS' '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW Carr appeared on Fox News Channel’s \"America’s Newsroom\" to explain why seeing the full transcript is so critical. \"We have sought the unedited copy of the transcript in the video from this interview. And as part of an FCC investigation, there was a complaint filed under something called the news distortion policy. And that's a 50-year-old policy at the FCC that applies to broadcasters,\" Carr told host Dana Perino. \"And the policy says you can't, you know, swap answers out to make it look like somebody said something entirely different. The classic case is if someone says yes to an answer, and you splice in a no answer,\" he continued. \"Here it's usually very difficult to make out news distortion complaints. You don't want the FCC leaning in too heavily on this. But here… CBS played the same question on two different programs, and clearly the words of the answers were very different.\" As a result, Carr said that the FCC wants to see the transcript. \"It's due today, and I expect CBS to provide it by the end of the day to see what in fact was said as part of our own news distortion investigation,\" Carr said. Perino then asked the FCC chairman what sort of consequences CBS could face. TRUMP COULD BE ON VERGE OF LEGAL VICTORY AGAINST CBS AS SETTLEMENT SPECULATION HEATS UP \"Well, look, there'll be the full suite of FCC options that are on the table that apply to any broadcast licensee. We obviously haven't made any decisions, but there's no way that the FCC can adjudicate this claim without getting a copy of the transcript,\" Carr said. \"You know, at the end of the Biden administration, my predecessor summarily dismissed this complaint, but I'm not sure how you can possibly do that without seeing the actual video to see what was the real answer,\" he added. \"Was it edited? Was it, you know, edited for clarity and length, which would be fine. Or are there other reasons why the editing took place?\" Carr said the FCC will be \"open-minded\" when it comes to potential consequences and transparency is \"incredibly important\" when dealing with this type of issue. \"I do think the American public ultimately deserve to see this for themselves. And what's interesting is, CBS releases other transcripts,\" Carr said. Trump’s lawsuit focused on an exchange Harris had with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker. In a preview clip that aired on \"Face the Nation,\" Harris was asked why it seemed like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn’t listening to the U.S. \"Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of, many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region,\" Harris responded in the \"Face the Nation\" clip. CBS NEWS STATEMENT ON CONTROVERSIAL ’60 MINUTES’ EDIT FALLS FLAT ON SOCIAL MEDIA: 'PUBLISH. THE. TRANSCRIPT.' Harris was mocked by conservatives for offering a lengthy \"word salad\" to Whitaker. But when that same question aired the following night in the primetime election special, a shorter, more focused answer from the vice president followed. \"We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end,\" Harris said in the primetime special. CBS previously refuted Trump’s claims. \"Same question. Same answer. But a different portion of the response. When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point,\" the network previously said in a statement.

They are engaging in a coup, finishing the work Trump started on January 6, 2021.\n\nTrump is nakedly breaking the law right in front of the entire country, just as progressive Democrats have been predicting. Not a single elected Republican has had the courage to try to stop him or even speak out against his lawlessness, and only a handful of Democrats have found that fearlessness. That has to change.\n\n— Trump is illegally firing career Civil Service prosecutors in the DOJ and agents in the FBI. The principal message he is conveying is, “Donald Trump, his family, and his friends are above the law. Investigate them and you will lose your job.”\n\n— He’s illegally fired Inspectors General who search out and prosecute corruption within their own agencies. \n\n— He’s illegally impounded money appropriated by Congress. \n\n— He’s illegally imposing tariffs against Mexico and Canada, turning our friends against us, just like Putin has dreamed for years.\n\n— USAID, created by President Kennedy, is our single most effective tool for keeping poor countries on America’s side instead of joining Russia or China. Musk has declared war on this Agency, and the only beneficiaries will be those two dictatorships.\n\n— And now this South African billionaire has apparently downloaded all of your and my private information from the federal agencies responsible for making six trillion dollars’ worth of payments every year, with the explicit permission of Treasury Secretary and billionaire Scott Bessent — who was put into his job with the votes of 15 compliant Democratic senators.\n\nAs Senator Patty Murray (who voted against Bessent) noted on Bluesky yesterday:\n\n“All of your most sensitive data and our country’s checkbook are in the hands of an unelected billionaire. This is the most corrupt administration in history and it’s putting our economy & government in serious jeopardy. “It’s time to speak out and fight back. www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/u...”\n\nHell, it’s way past time to speak out and fight back. \n\nEver since Reagan’s Revolution on behalf of the billionaire class, many of us have been shouting from the rooftops about the inevitability of this day. I’ve published multiple books and hundreds of articles (see * below), as have many of my colleagues, warning of this exact scenario.\n\nThis is the tail-end of the battle, not the beginning:\n\n— When Republicans claimed that corporations were “persons” with rights guaranteed under the Bill of Rights (including the right to fund political campaigns), Democrats could have spoken out, but — other than the progressives — didn’t. Instead, Bill Clinton encouraged corporate contributions to his “New Democrats.”\n\n— When Republicans said billionaires and corporations bribing politicians was legal (and could even be considered “tips”), Democrats could have spoken out, but — other than the progressives — didn’t. Instead the “Problem Solvers” and many others simply put their hands out. \n\n— When Republicans gutted union protections, borrowed $34 trillion to fund tax breaks for billionaires, and ended support for college tuition, Democrats could have spoken out, but — other than the progressives — didn’t. Instead, many “moved to the center.” \n\n— When Republicans fought voting rights and purged over 50 million voters from the rolls over the past decade (giving Trump the White House last year), Democrats could have raised hell, but — other than the progressives — didn’t. Instead, they abandoned Red states, often not even bothering to run candidates.\n\n— When Republicans denied climate change and went to the mat to protect the hundreds of billions in subsidies the fossil fuel industry gets every year, Democrats could have stopped them, but — other than the progressives — didn’t. Instead, they complained about “disruptive” groups protesting pipelines. \n\n— When Republicans raised an entire Astroturf Tea Party movement to fight progressive efforts to put into place a national healthcare system that would include a buy-in option for Medicare at all ages, Democrats could have fought for their constituents, but — other than the progressives — didn’t. Instead, they offered a privatized Obamacare and weak “negotiation” with drug companies to lower prices on 10 drugs while ignoring the creeping privatization of Medicare with the Medicare Advantage scam. \n\nIn each case, progressive Democrats were ahead of the curve and corporate Democrats either ignored or even obstructed needed reforms. \n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have been steamrolling ahead with their plan — first laid out by Lewis Powell in 1971 — to turn our country into an oligarchy that’s no longer accountable to its people. \n\nAnd now they’re just months away from finishing off our democratic republic, silencing all voices of dissent, and guaranteeing — like Trump promised — that we may never be able to even vote again in a meaningful election with candidates who aren’t pre-vetted by billionaires. \n\nThe greatest danger America is facing today — because Democratic messaging and outrage have been so weak for so long — is that average people won’t realize what’s happening until it’s too late. \n\nMeanwhile, the leadership of the Democratic Party — Hakeem Jefferies in the House and Chuck Schumer in the Senate — are both saying that they’re not going to challenge Trump on every crime he commits, and Democratic senators voted unanimously for Trump’s pick for Secretary of State, who’s now in Panama threatening that sovereign government.\n\nTrump is working as hard as possible to make his fascist vision of America a reality by attacking, threatening, and suing reporters and media outlets while his billionaire buddies and AIPAC threaten to fund primary challenges against any politician — Democrat or Republican — who dares to challenge them.\n\nAnd the threats are working: \n\n— The media is walking on pins and needles, trying to avoid pissing off Trump or Musk. \n\n— The FCC just launched an investigation that could lead to the end of NPR and PBS. \n\n— Major networks are paying off Trump to settle frivolous lawsuits. \n\n— Democrats are treating Vichy Republicans as if they were good faith colleagues during normal times, many even voting for Trump’s cabinet nominees.\n\nBut these are not normal times: Our democracy is hanging by a thread. The simple reality is that the MAGA takeover of the GOP has turned it into, essentially, an agent of Putin’s Russia and Xi’s China. And an immigrant billionaire is deconstructing our government like a toddler busting up a Lego set.\n\nDemocrats — who campaigned on the allegation that Trump was a fascist — must now behave like their claim was true and fight back, before Trump and Musk finalize Orbán’s and Putin’s neofascist governance model, making such a response impossible.\n\n— Shut down the House and the Senate. \n\n— Challenge Johnson’s speakership. \n\n— Fight every unanimous consent vote.\n\n— Use quorum calls to bring floor business to a standstill.\n\n— Put holds on every Trump nominee, even for things like naming Post Offices or noncontroversial positions.\n\n— Hold a major press conference every day and coordinate with Democrats across the nation to amplify that day’s message across local and national media. \n\n— Organize political guerilla theater and mass protest events.\n\nAverage people can reach out to their elected officials — the phone number for Congress is 202-224-3121 — and raise absolute holy hell. Blow up social media with protest and outrage posts. Share your concerns with friends, family, co-workers, and neighbors.\n\nAs Bernie Sanders — who’s been fighting this fight his entire life and was on my radio/TV show every Friday for 11 years — shared yesterday with people subscribed to his newsletter: \n\n“We must fight back — effectively. This is not a time for wallowing in despair and hiding under the covers. The stakes are too high. We’re not just fighting for ourselves. We’re fighting for our kids and for future generations. We’re fighting for the future of this planet.“Further, we must not become overwhelmed and think that Trump has some kind of extraordinary mandate and an inevitable glide path into the future. That’s what the right-wing mouthpieces want you to believe, but it’s not true. Trump won the election because Kamala Harris and a very weak and out-of-touch Democratic Party received 5 million votes LESS than Biden did in 2020, not because Donald Trump or his agenda were popular. His agenda can be defeated. …“We cannot just play defense. We have got to be on offense. Please, never forget, the agenda that we are fighting for is widely supported by working families all across this country. And we must continue to fight for that agenda.”\n\nIt only took Hitler 53 days to use legal means to turn Germany from a functioning democracy into a dictatorship. We’ve officially gone way too far down that same road, and if Trump and Project 2025 aren’t stopped now it may well be too late by as soon as this Spring.\n\n*Many of us have been raising the alarm for years:\n\nThree decades ago (1995), I wrote a bestselling book about climate change, , which is now in its third complete rewrite/edition and available in 17 languages. It’s been made into or inspired several feature-length movies, including a short, shocking video that Leonardo DiCaprio and I put together a decade ago. Today’s Republicans, owned outright by fossil fuel billionaires since the 1980s, continue to deny the clear link between their products and the deaths and property damage extreme weather are causing.\n\nJust a few years later (1999), I broke the story in my book that corporate personhood had not, in fact, been ratified by the Supreme Court in 1886, but was a scam promulgated by the wealthy Republican Clerk of the Court, John Chandler Bancroft Davis, on behalf of the railroad oligarchs.\n\nWhen George W. Bush doubled down on Reaganomics with his massive trillion-dollar 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for billionaires and a Labor Department hostile to workers’ rights, I wrote , detailing how Republican policies are devastating working class people, students, and people living on Social Security. Things have only gotten worse in the years since it was first published.\n\nWhen Bush and Cheney lied us into two illegal wars to seize oil and save Halliburton, I wrote . The back cover copy says:\n\n“America faces its greatest threat since the Civil War. The worst fears of the Founders are being realized, as powerful corporate interests have taken over our culture and representative government. We the People now face a fundamental choice: take back our country ... or do nothing, and become victims of tyranny and empire.”\n\nThose were followed by a book on the rightwing’s war on American culture (), political messaging (), and two histories of America’s founding and what it means for today (and with Dan Sisson).\n\nSince then I’ve published the Hidden History series of 10 short books alerting Americans to our gun crisis, the GOP’s war on voting, the Supreme Court’s betrayal of America, the rise of American monopolies (foreword by Ralph Nader), the dangers of rising oligarchy, our corrupt healthcare system, how tech billionaires are this generation’s Big Brother, how neoliberalism took over both political parties and then America, the history of our democracy and its Native American inspiration, and what’s happened to the American Dream and how to recover it.\n\nMany of us have been fighting this predicted rise of fascism — kicked off in 1981 by Ronald Reagan — for years, even decades. Please join us and share the message as far and wide as you can!","summary":"Is Trump’s, Musk’s, and Putin’s coup against democracy complete?\n\nUnder the guise of a 44-year campaign to reverse the middle-class advances of the New Deal and Great Society, rightwing billionaires and the Republicans they own have pushed a fundamentally fascist agenda that is now openly at war with America.

One skit Fineman said she hoped to do was inspired by the erotic thriller Babygirl, starring Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson, but Chalamet didn’t find the concept as exciting.\n\n \"I pitched a lot of us touching, or like Babygirl and he's giving me milk, and he wasn't really having that milk-Babygirl stuff,” Fineman laughed, referring to the iconic scene where Dickinson's character orders Kidman's a glass of milk of across the bar and watches her drink it.\n\n When a fan asked why she didn’t do her iconic impression of the actor while he was there hosting, Fineman said she didn’t feel like it was the right time.\n\n \"I've been saying, I feel like I've done it twice already this year without him, and I really feel like I'm leaning more, like, L word,\" she explained, joking, “I don’t know. I'm a lot older than him. I just feel like I'm this cool les lady. I just feel like I'm, like, too lesbian.\"\n\n \"I think that now we know each other, it's sort of embarrassing,\" she continued. \"I feel like this weird older woman, being like, 'Hey little boy, can I put your sweatpants on?' 'Cause I've worn his — sometimes I'll wear his real clothes doing it, which was really fun.\"\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n Fineman was most recently dressed as Chalamet in November when she did a sketch about the Timothée Chalamet look-alike contest that happened in New York. That same night, former Vice President Kamala Harris was also at the show, and Fineman revealed in a TikTok that she had forgotten she didn’t exactly look like herself at the time.\n\n “I'm waiting for photographic evidence, but last night at SNL, I turned a corner and I was like, ‘Oh my god, Oh my god.’ And it was Kamala,” she told fans in a video. “I'm a freak and was like ‘Bay Area’ because I'm from the Bay as is she.”\n\n “And I was like, ‘Oh my god, blah, blah, blah, you lived in my best friend's apartment,’ like, doo, doo, talking about Oakland. And I was so excited,” Fineman added, saying she didn’t think twice about snapping a photo with the politician.\n\n “Her aides were like, ‘Do you want a picture?’ And I was like, ‘Yes.’ And I held her hand and just was motivational and speaking from the heart,” she said. “And then, we go to take the picture, and as we're taking a picture, I'm like, ‘Oh my god, I'm dressed as Timothée Chalamet.' I need to find this picture, but damn, and I don't look bad as Timothée Chalamet but it's crazy. It's crazy.”\n\n Saturday Night Live airs Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. ET on NBC.","summary":"\"He wasn't really having that milk-'Babygirl' stuff,\" Fineman joked","url":"https://people.com/chloe-fineman-pitched-timothee-chalamet-babygirl-style-snl-sketch-8784921","image":"https://people.com/thmb/JjiaCexPiFk28FU-cZG3TihCVuM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(779x431:781x433)/chloe-fineman-timothee-chalamet-020325-1-e5d04a3869b041febde76eacfb285588.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-03 18:09:00","author":"Liza Esquibias","authors":["Liza Esquibias"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.338},{"id":286715458,"title":"Did Elon Musk and Dana White force Joe Rogan to cancel Kamala Harris interview during U.S election campaign? Here's what a book has claimed","text":"A new book by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes has broadly claimed that Elon Musk and UFC's Dana White were instrumental in convincing Joe Rogan and his team about not interviewing Kamala Harris during the hot battle in the US Presidential election 2024 campaigning, says a Daily Express US report. This new revelation has turned the eyes of the political circles of the US and speaks about the political prowess and influence of Elon Musk and Dana White. New book reveals eye-catching details about Elon Musk?Titled, 'FIGHT: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House', this new book talks about the days leading up to the US Presidential elections 2024, and went on behind the curtains during the campaigning period. This book's scheduled publish date is April 1, but its latest excerpts are quite shocking and interesting at the same time, and this revelation about Elon Musk and Dana White is all the more interesting. What exactly happened between Joe Rogan and Kamala Harris?Joe Rogan was supposed to take the interview of Kamala Harris, and the then VP and Democrat candidate had even planned the course of her campaign accordingly. However, at the last minute, it was seen that Donald Trump is going to get interviewed by Joe Rogan instead, and that proved to be quite instrumental for the winning candidate later on. Rogan's audience is mainly young male voters and Kamala Harris' target was to reach out to them through the interview. However, she lost that window of opportunity, largely due to Elon Musk and Dana White, says the new book. FAQs:Is Elon Musk a Trump supporter? Yes, Elon Musk is currently a Donald Trump supporter and has extensively backed him during the recently concluded US Presidential elections 2024.Is Elon Musk now a part of the Trump Cabinet? Elon Musk is now part of the federal government in a big way. He is now the head of the Department of Government Efficiency.","summary":"Tesla CEO Elon Musk and UFC's Dana White had allegedly convinced Joe Rogan's team about not interviewing US 2024 Presidential election candidate Kamala Harris, suggests a new book.

She’s a political liberal and cast her vote for Kamala Harris last fall. As we talked, I discovered she shared common ground with the MAGA crowd: My friend was outraged by what she said “diversity, equity and inclusion” initiatives have done to the entertainment industry. Instead of prioritizing quality art, my friend told me that publishers and studios pressure creators to produce content focused on protected classes, such as minorities or disabled characters. When creators comply, they get criticized for “cultural appropriation” for trying to include perspectives for which they have no first-person knowledge. Anyone except Hollywood’s biggest names and guaranteed box-office draws can get stuck in a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don’t cycle. Making matters worse, the scourge of racial preferencing isn’t limited to fictional characters, but to the artists and actors themselves. In 2020, for example, it was reported that CBS pushed writers’ rooms for its shows to include at least 40% representation of individuals who were Black, Indigenous or people of color. Though well-intentioned, such policies leave many feeling like checkboxes on a diversity scorecard. (And it’s not like the push for diversity has made our movies more entertaining or enjoyable. Often, the mandate for forced diversity and “woke” agendas undermines passion, originality and quality in the creative arts.) Of course, the long arm of diversity initiatives reaches far beyond the world of entertainment, touching the lives of many, if not most, Americans. In recent years, inclusion mandates and training have wormed their way into virtually every facet of American life, including (but certainly not limited to) Hollywood, corporations and academia, just to name a few of the most prominent targets. This brings us to the world of elective politics. Amid the flurry of executive orders and initiatives President Trump has undertaken since returning to the White House, there are plenty of controversial — and in many cases probably unconstitutional — actions. But his order to dismantle diversity programs in the federal government stands out as a notable exception. Let’s hope it will be a shot across the bow, accelerating an end to these initiatives in the private sector as well. Most of us broadly support the principles of diversity, inclusion and equality (the term of art “equity” — with its emphasis on equal outcomes rather than equal opportunities — remains a more controversial issue). But for many Americans who must endure the relentless push to navigate hypersensitive cultural norms or endure endless “training” sessions — sometimes more like Maoist “struggle sessions” aimed at conformity and compliance — Trump’s pushback against this overbearing orthodoxy is a welcome relief. On college campuses, diversity programs frame the Founding Fathers as “colonizers” or label European art as “oppressive.” As Nicholas Confessore of the New York Times reported last year, the University of Michigan’s largest division hands out guides for “Identifying and Addressing Characteristics of White Supremacy Culture,” which include such traits as the “worship of the written word.” One might tolerate these initiatives if they delivered tangible benefits. However, they often fail to achieve their ostensible goals. In the aforementioned Michigan case, after the program had gone into effect, a survey found: “Students were less likely to interact with people of a different race or religion or with different politics — the exact kind of engagement DEI programs, in theory, are meant to foster.” The backlash isn’t confined to disaffected students or boomer workers clinging to outdated prejudices. As my friend in Los Angeles can attest, its overreach has alienated a broad swath of Americans, including many who wouldn’t typically align with Trump’s base. That’s because its race-conscious worldview runs counter to a core American value: the idea, championed by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., that we should at least aspire to be a colorblind society. As such, we probably shouldn’t be surprised that rampant identity politics and political correctness has sparked a powerful backlash, or that increasing numbers of young people and even racial minorities — cohorts that traditionally skew liberal — are rebelling by doing the unthinkable: voting Republican. Instead of fostering inclusion or understanding (or even browbeating the masses into obedience), diversity programs have inadvertently radicalized or “red-pilled” many erstwhile liberal Americans, leaving them resentful and disillusioned. Now, to those of us who closely follow politics and care about the preservation of liberal democracy, turning to Trump as a savior might seem absurd, given his two impeachments, 54 felony indictments and role in inciting the Capitol riot. But here’s the thing: For the average American, these lofty concerns can feel distant, esoteric and abstract. To paraphrase George Orwell, the boot stomping your face on a regular basis isn’t MAGA — it’s the DEI administrator or HR director. For all the richly deserved criticism Trump gets for behaving like a totalitarian strongman, it is notable that one of his more resonant actions so far involves loosening the draconian grip of “diversity, equity and inclusion” on American life. If he succeeds, he will have ironically dismantled one of the strongest justifications for his own political appeal. In this regard, I’m rooting for his success. Matt K.

I'm so ready to have this baby now, I can't wait I've been throwing up all morning.' \nCharlotte had an ectopic pregnancy back in 2016 which left her fearing she would never be able to have kids.\nAn ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg implants itself outside of the womb, usually in the fallopian tube, meaning a baby is unable to develop and leaving the mother's health in danger.\nShe said: 'I hadn't ever felt pain like this and couldn't take anymore. I told Kate [a friend] to cancel the doctor, I need to go to the hospital, this is something worse than period pain.'\nShe said she found out she was pregnant after giving a urine sample and said of the moment: 'I was in shock, and when Kate said 'Congratulations!' I said no no no, this is bad.'\n\nIt comes after Charlotte revealed she would be having planned C-section as she finds it 'too hard to push a baby out' as she opened up about her second pregnancy last month\n\nCharlotte admitted she does not want to feel 'out of control' during child birth and has 'absolutely no desire to push' as she explained why she has booked for a C-section (pictured in November)\nCharlotte told how her heart sank as she knew it was something serious and recalls crying and panicking whether she could ever have a baby in the future.\n'I found out my fallopian tube had completely ruptured, and the doctor had to remove my left fallopian tube and an ovary,' she said.\nDuring her second pregnancy, Charlotte and fiancé Jake were also subjected to an armed burglary at their £1 million Sunderland mansion back in November last year.\nAnd her upcoming four-part Paramount+ series will include the aftermath of the terrifying incident.\nCharlotte exclusively told MailOnline: 'There's lots of things that have happened over the past few months that are quite heavily featured, which I've never spoken about at all, because obviously it's police matters.\n'But the burglary, everything like that, the show was there. Do you know what I mean?\n'But I've never spoke about that with anyone. I've not answered any interview questions. It's a police matter like as it stands.\n'But basically, the show was with us 24/7, whilst all this was going on. So there's lots - there's so much in every single episode and there's only four episodes. So like, you're kind of not going to want it to end.'\n\nThe birth has also been filmed for Charlotte's reality show, Geordie Shore : Charlotte's Having Another Baby \n\nThe TV personality previously admitted she couldn't wait for her pregnancy to be over as she had a hard time during her final trimester (pictured in November)\nAfter such a scary ordeal, when asked about if she felt nervous about opening her home up for the world to see on the TV, she admitted that it did make her 'rethink' her decision.\nCharlotte admitted: 'I've been in that house for a decade, and it's been on TV all the way through them 10 years.\n'I think, after it happened, it definitely made us rethink like how much of the house I should really be showing. Now I've got children.\n'And so it definitely made us rethink a lot of things, having a lot of conversations and just like, thinking about a lot.\n'Yeah, I definitely think, not necessarily nervous... But definitely rethinking like, maybe the future.'\nCharlotte was heavily pregnant with her unborn daughter when a gang of balaclava-masked raiders entered her home. \nDays later Charlotte gave fans an update on her social media, confessing that it left her 'living in fear'.\n\nCharlotte's fiancé Jake shared the terrifying news on his Instagram Story\n\nShe told her fans on Instagram: 'I now have the BEST security in the northeast with man guards, security dogs and 24/7 surveillance.'\nThe star added: 'I've been living in fear since last week. Not feeling safe in your own home with small children is really something else.\n'I've been trying my hardest to put what happened out of my head! And I'm sorry for being on here!\n'It's just took some time dealing with everything that's gone on and then I was in hospital!'\nGeordie ShoreInstagramLondonCharlotte Crosby\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nCharlotte Crosby shares first glimpse of her baby girl in heartwarming snap introducing newborn to daughter Alba, 2, as she confirms arrival of her second child with fiancé Jake Ankers\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nPrince Louis turns royal photographer!

I hope it is. I really do, because I don't want to feel like this for the rest of my life.' \n\nUna Healy has reportedly split from her boyfriend Aidan Coleman, just a few months after she went public with their romance\n\nA source close to the former Saturdays singer, 43, rconfirmed the news on Tuesday, saying the couple have 'split amicably' after several months of dating \nJust a few months ago in November, Una revealed she was 'very happy' in her new relationship with Aidan, as she spoke about their romance for the first time. \nShe arrived at the The Irish Post Awards at The Grosvenor House Hotel in London where she opened up about her relationship with the retired jockey.\nUna, who was joined by Aidan at the glitzy ceremony, told The Sun at the time: 'He's hiding on his crutches tonight, but he's a great guy and I'm very happy.\n'He reached out to me and we met up and clicked. He's such a kind and great person - I love him.'\nHowever, after going their seperate ways it seems Aidan is already back on the market.\nThe Bumble profile, which is thought to be his, confirmed that he is residing in London now and includes pictures with horses.\nThere is also a snap of him on a boat from his travels and another of the retired sportsman unwinding as he smoked a cigar in a pub garden.\nMailOnline has contacted representatives for Una for comment. \nUna was married to rugby star Ben Foden from 2012 until 2018 and has Aoife Belle, 11 and nine-year-old Tadhg with him.\n\n (pictured in 2021)Aidan has also recently packed his bags and moved back to England after spending six months in Ireland, where Una currently resides, amid reports of the breakup\n\nAnd it seems the retired Irish jockey has already moved on as he's been spotted on the dating app Bumble , with his profile reading that he's looking for 'fun' and 'casual dates'\n\n Una Healy breaks her silence on her new romance with jockey Aidan Coleman \nThey divorced after he was unfaithful to her and she started dating Limerick hurler David Breen that year but split with him by February 2020.\nThe following year she struck up a relationship with an unnamed Dublin-based police officer that came to an end in May 2022.\nIt was then reported that she was in a three-way relationship with David Haye, 44, and model Sian Osborne, 31 - fuelling the claims by posting a cosy snap of the trio on holiday in Morocco.\nYet she went on to clarify that she was never actually part of a 'throuple', revealing the only person she was dating was David - although he was simultaneously dating Sian.\nAfter calling an end to her time with David, she was said to be dating the voice of Love Island Australia - Stephen Mullen - in August but they split two months later.\nSpeaking about her complicated love life on the Boots UK presents Taboo Talk podcast this week, Una - who previously signed up to dating app Raya - explained that she rushed into the romance, and should've taken time to enjoy being single.\nThe mother-of-two explained: 'You do feel a pressure, maybe that's why I dated so quickly and went into a relationship with someone after my divorce so fast.\n'I felt, 'I need someone, I have to find someone,' and I didn't at all!\n\nThe Bumble profile, which is thought to be his, confirmed that he is residing in London now and includes pictures with horses\n\nUna was married to rugby player Ben Foden before rumours of him cheating put an end to things (pictured together in December 2017) \n\nAfter splitting from her cheating ex in 2018, the Saturdays singer, 42, began dating Limerick hurler David Breen that year but split by February 2020 \n\nIn 2023, Una joked about being 'hoodwinked' into a throuple with boxer David Haye and his girlfriend Sian Osborne, describing the experience as the 'worst six months of my life' \n\nUna put an end to the unconventional relationship with David Haye after 'growing tired of the negative attention' it generated\n\n'That just never worked out anyway, for the best, but I did think there was a lot of pressure on me to find someone.'\n'Rather than enjoy being on my own and re-discovering myself and then maybe meeting someone organically out and about but I prevented that happening by getting into a relationship so soon.\nAdmitting she was straight onto Raya, an exclusive dating app used by many celebrities, influencers and socialites, she went on to say of one suitor: 'We were so uncompatible. It was like chalk and cheese!'\nIt is understood that David and Sian, who started dating in 2020, drafted Una into a three-way romance.\nBut Una put an end to the unconventional relationship after 'growing tired of the negative attention' it generated.\nUna released the song Walk Away in June 2023, which was about her situation with the long-term couple.\nPromoting the song on Vogue Williams and Joanne McNally's My Therapist Ghosted Me podcast, Una spoke of how she was after a monogamous relationship with David, but was instead left feeling 'hoodwinked.'\nUna explained: 'Dating HIM is the right term because that's how it was, it wasn't a throuple. We had a lovely relationship.'\nAs Joanne quipped, 'you were hoodwinked into a throuple', Una agreed: 'I was!'\nLondonUna Healy\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nUna Healy 'SPLITS from Aidan Coleman' just months after going public with their romance - and the retired jockey has already 'moved on'\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nPrince Louis turns royal photographer!

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy SAM LAWLEY \n Published:16:49 GMT, 3 February 2025 |Updated:16:51 GMT, 3 February 2025 \n\nA 1990s indie icon has taken a look back on his time touring with Oasis as the megagroup made famous appearances at Knebworth, Maine Road and across the US.\nThis musician was joined by a bandmate on The Chris Moyles Show on Radio X on Monday to lift the lid on Britpop's wild halcyon days three decades ago.\nTheir group's hits included If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next and The Masses Against The Classes, both of which made it to the top of the UK singles charts.\nHailing from Blackwood in Wales, the band were an instrumental part of the Cool Cymru movement in the 90s and their albums Everything Must Go in 1996 and This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours two years later gained a cult following. \nTheir lead lyricist and bassist, now 56, was given his pseudonym for his tall and lanky frame and often shocked crowds by wearing a dress or a skirt to perform at gigs.\nThe star has released two solo projects alongside his work with the group and has two children with his childhood sweetheart. \nCan you guess who the Britpop icon is? \n\nNicky Wire has taken a look back on his time touring with Oasis as the megagroup made famous appearances at Knebworth, Maine Road and across the US \n\nThe musician lifted the lid on Britpop's wild halcyon days three decades ago as he was joined by a bandmate on The Chris Moyles Show on Radio X on Monday\n\nOn touring with Oasis, he said: 'We've supported them a lot, and it's some of the best gigs I've ever seen'\nIt is none other than Manic Street Peachers star Nicky Wire.\nIn conversation with Chris, the lyricist and guitarist joined lead singer James Dean Bradfield in reflecting on travelling around with the Gallagher brothers as they opened for Oasis at some of their biggest 90s shows.\nHe said: 'We've supported them a lot, and it's some of the best gigs I've ever seen. Like, Maine Road for instance, I thought Maine Road was going to fall apart. I've never seen a stadium shake like that, it was nearly frightening. \n'We toured with them America, when they sort of cancelled the two halfway through, which was brilliant. There was so much jeopardy and anxiety. \n'And we were on; we were finished by half seven. We could just sit back every night. They were really excitingly on the edge.'\nIt proved something of a high point for the group as they ended up getting a front row seat for an iconic tour, albeit one that Liam Gallagher missed as he was moving house. \nNicky added: 'He said, \"I didn't have a house\". So, the first gigs, Noel sang. And it was a spectacular tour, you know? And it's the one time things were going really well for us. \n'Everything was go, was flying. We'd be finished by half seven every night. Good hotels.'\n\nTheir group's hits included If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next and The Masses Against The Classes, both of which made it to the top of the UK singles charts\n\nHailing from Blackwood in Wales, the band were an instrumental part of the Cool Cymru movement in the 90s\nOasis are making a long-awaited reunion this summer after 16 years but Nicky was not confident that Manic Street Preachers would be opening for them this time around. \n'I think they want to get younger bands, so they went for Cast,' he said. 'We're all good. I can't wait to see Cast at those gigs as well. \n'But like you said, when they played Maine Road, Maine Road was waiting to fall down at that point!'\nNicky, better known for his guitar work, will provide the lead vocals on a Manic Street Preachers track for the first time ahead of their 15th studio album, titled Critical Thinking, which is due for release this year.\nManic Street Preachers guitarist and singer song-writer Richey Edwards famosuly disappeared on February 1 1995. To this day his disappearance remains a mystery.\nThings have changed over the band's 40 years together, with Nicky admitting that they have had to adjust their methods. \nHe added: 'We're lucky enough to have our own studio. So we have realised now that if we get that inspiration, we're all within 15, 20 minutes, we just pile in either together or individually, and we just get on with it. \n'You know, that's a lucky position we're in where we've worked hard for it. But yeah, the idea of going away for a studio for four weeks and just wasting thousands of pounds like we used to, it's just not viable anymore. \n'I've sung before, but yeah, this is the first time it's on a lead track.'\n\nNicky (pictured, centre), better known for his guitar work, will provide the lead vocals on a Manic Street Preachers track for the first time ahead of their 15th studio album\n\nThe star has released two solo projects alongside his work with the group and has two children with his childhood sweetheart\n\nIn conversation with Chris, the lyricist and guitarist joined lead singer James Dean Bradfield in reflecting on travelling around with the Gallagher brothers as they opened for Oasis\n\n The (changing) faces of Britpop! A look at the stars of the nineties now and then \nJames chimed in: 'I think it's a famous Orson Welles quote where he kind of said, \"Some days acting is like driving a tricycle through a barrel full of molasses\". Some days it's just rubbish. It is. \n'But you know that if you just hang in there, you know, keep in the game, stay in the game, you know, the good days will just come. It's as simple as that, really. \n'I'm not trying to be wise or, you know, I'm not trying to be David Carradine wandering through the desert with a bit of wisdom. \n'But, kind of, if you just hang in there, it comes, you know?'\nOasisRadioWales\n\nShare or comment on this article: \n90s indie icon is unrecognisable as he looks back on touring with Oasis including wild concerts at Knebworth, Maine Road and the US - but can you guess who it is?\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nPrince Louis turns royal photographer!

The X CEO and leader of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) made a splash last weekend after DOGE representatives were given access to the Treasury Department payment system. But there is another interesting—if less sensational—story involving Musk from this past weekend, and it's notable for the way it illustrates the facade of Musk's professed support for free speech and free markets.\n\nOn Saturday, Musk added seven new targets to a lawsuit accusing advertisers of violating U.S. antitrust law by choosing not to advertise on X.\n\nMusk first filed this suit last August against the World Federation of Advertisers and the companies Unilever, Mars, CVS Health, and Orsted. In an amended complaint filed Saturday, he added Nestle, Abbott Laboratories, Colgate-Palmolive Company, Lego, Pinterest, Tyson Foods, and Shell.\n\nBasically, Musk thinks it should be illegal for these companies to have simultaneously pulled advertising dollars from his company.\n\nMusk's suit alleges that these companies colluded in a way that violates U.S. antitrust law. The companies were all part of the World Federation of Advertisers and were \"concerned that X, formerly known as Twitter, would stray from [the federation's] brand safety initiative called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media,\" reports NPR.\n\nIn response, the defendant companies and others either stopped or reduced their advertising spending on the platform. And as a result, X lost a lot of money, according to the suit.\n\nThis, in turn, made X \"a less effective competitor to other social media platforms in the sale of digital advertising and in competing for user engagement on its platform,\" it states. In this way, the boycott allegedly violated laws against anticompetitive actions.\n\nBut in this case, X became less \"competitive\" because of its own actions and the actions of its founder. You can judge for yourself whether opposing Musk's new policies on Twitter/X was prudent or justified. But it is silly to suggest that companies shouldn't be allowed to oppose them just because it would make X less competitive.\n\nAntitrust law cannot require private companies to continue associating with a company they don't wish to simply because ceasing business with that company will make it less competitive. That would be completely contrary to the ideas of free markets and open competition, and also completely contrary to the idea of free speech.\n\nMusk tries to dress up his complaint in the language of choice and freedom, arguing that social media entities must be allowed to set their own moderation policies and that \"collective action among competing advertisers to dictate brand safety standards\" is bad for consumers.\n\nAnd corporate entities have certainly been known to encourage atmospheres where speech—be that speech from employees, their own corporate speech, or the speech of platforms where they advertise—is overly \"safe.\" (I once worked for a women's health website where we were forbidden from using the terms \"vagina\" or \"rape\" in headlines because advertisers didn't like it.)\n\nBut that is their prerogative. Private entities are perfectly free to encourage those they do business with to adopt certain values, and they're perfectly free to use private market mechanisms—such as boycotts—as part of this encouragement. Boycotts are a part of free markets and of free expression.\n\nThe alternative that Musk is demanding would be worse than a world of woke corporations and overly cautious advertisers. In this world, private market actors would be compelled to continue doing business with entities they wish not to and to broadcast their speech in venues they do not wish to. (Conservatives cheering on Musk should imagine how this would work out in other contexts. Do you want companies with conservative values to be forbidden from pulling ads from platforms that decided to promote porn, Kamala Harris, and DEI?)\n\nTo add credence to his antitrust claims, Musk suggests that pulling advertising was \"against the unilateral self-interest of the advertisers\" and \"made economic sense only in furtherance of a conspiracy performed in the confidence that competing advertisers were doing the same.\" This falls apart upon examination. At the time Musk took over, many left-of-center people were upset about it and worried about the policies he would put in place. And many companies were (and are) concerned with appearing insufficiently attune to progressive speech standards and/or \"harm\" on social media more generally. Whether or not you agree with that, it's not unreasonable for such companies to worry about reputational harm that could harm their bottom line. It's also not unreasonable for them to have feared that an exodus of users would diminish the value of advertising on the platform, and to have temporarily pulled back spending to see how things shook out. In short, there are several legitimate business reasons why companies may have suspended advertising at that time.\n\nThe fact that these companies acted in tandem, not alone, is at the core of Musk's complaint. But it shouldn't make a bit of difference. Acting in tandem is how boycotts work. And boycotts—by individuals or corporations—are a form of protected speech.\n\nMusk likes to style himself as a defender of free speech and free markets, but he's shown time and again that this principle falls to the wayside when it conflicts with his self-interest. This lawsuit serves as a perfect example.\n\nMore Sex & Tech News\n\n• A California cop has been found guilty of \"deprivation of constitutional rights under color of law\" for abducting and sexually assaulting four women.\n\n• Some meditations on where the \"tech right\" came from.\n\n• Shifting age verification mandates from online platforms to app stores doesn't solve the problems with age verification, write Josh Withrow and Shoshana Weissman of the R Street Institute:\n\nState and federal legislation mandating that sites verify users' age and adjust their social media experiences accordingly are still popular, despite the fact that they have repeatedly failed court challenges.

I can’t understand why anyone would do this,” one person on X/Twitter wrote, while another agreed: “I have no words for how disgusting and evil this is.” \n\nA third asked: “Seriously, what is the point of this? The two of them need help.” \n\n“Better rename her to Uncensori,” a fourth joked.\n\n“So we are just walking around naked now,” another questioned. \n\nIn a post on Instagram, Entertainment Tonight reported that West and Censori had been “escorted out after showing up uninvited.” That post was quickly deleted, but not before being shared widely on social media.\n\nHowever, Variety disputed reports that West and Censori were asked to leave, quoting a source close to the Grammys as saying it was “not true” and that West simply “walked the carpet, got in his car and left.”\n\nWest was nominated for Best Rap Song at this year’s Grammys for his 2024 hit song “Carnival.” \n\nJust one day before the big event, the artist posted a sexualized tweet about former Vice President Kamala Harris on X.\n\n“I used to want to f*** Kamala until she lost. I don’t f*** losers anymore,” he wrote online before deleting the message from the platform and apologizing to the politician’s children. \n\nHe went on to write: “Kamala seems like a very nice human. I just wanna say sorry to her kids.”","summary":"West and Censori drew heavy criticism for the Australian model’s ‘nude’ look on the Grammys red carpet","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/kanye-west-bianca-censori-grammys-afterparty-b2691299.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/03/05/APTOPIX_67th_Annual_Grammy_Awards_11864.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/0PUbjhGk-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-03 16:20:31","author":"Kaleigh Werner","authors":["Kaleigh Werner"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.02},{"id":286669118,"title":"'Middle-aged wine moms' are crucial to anti-Trump 'resistance' — here's why","text":"In 2020, a broad range of voters — from liberals and progressives to independents to Never Trump conservatives — decided against giving Donald Trump a second term.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy LUCY MURGATROYD \n Published:16:11 GMT, 3 February 2025 |Updated:16:16 GMT, 3 February 2025 \n\nYouTuber Pre is the first nappy-wearing influencer - and she is not ashamed of her incontinence, even managing to make a career out of it. \nThe 27-year-old, who is from Toronto, appeared on This Morning on Monday to chat to Ben Shephard, Cat Deeley and Dr Sara Kayatto raise awareness of her condition. \nThe social media star was just 19 when she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, which then caused her bladder issues, so she then decided to start wearing nappies online and display it all for the world to see. \nPre told them: 'It was really hard because I didn't have anyone to talk to. \n'And because of that it was very depressing for me, I was going through incontinence, there's so many problems going on and there was no one to talk to.\n'I was just depressed. It was a dark time for me.'\n\nA This Morning guest has admitted that they refuse to be ashamed of her incontinence - and has even made a career out of it\n\nYoutuber Pre, 27, has shared her incontinence journey on social media \nShe added: 'It was really hard for me mentally, when you think about who wears diapers, right, you'd think about babies or the elderly, what happens when your age falls in between? \n'It's like, why was I the anomaly?'\nCat was keen to know when she decided to take the power back and be open about her lifestyle online.\nPre said: 'Mine was my social media platform, YouTube, being so open about everything that I was going through. \n'Talking to people about my MS journey, talking to people about incontinence and even doing a diaper try-on.\n'Where people really loved what I was doing, where I was just so blunt and honest about everything. \n'People always told me that no one talks about these things. And more people need to talk about it. It encouraged me to want to do more videos.'\n\nThe guest chatted with Dr Sara about her condition \nWearing nappies has changed her life and has given her some independence. \nShe said: 'I don't fear being outside - that was the hardest part before coming across the diapers. \n'I would wet myself outside in public. That was traumatising, dehumanising, embarrassing.' \nPre took to her Instagram to share the exciting news that she was going to appear on the ITV show. \nShe wrote: 'EXCITING NEWS! I’m thrilled to announce that I’ll be appearing LIVE on ITV’s This Morning show tomorrow! \n'Tune in to watch my 8-10 minute segment where I’ll be sharing my personal story & spreading awareness about incontinence & adult diapers at 12pm/GMT. \n'If you’re unable to watch the LIVE, it will be posted on their YouTube channel.

Thank you for sharing your story and helping to break down the barriers for people suffering from incontinence x.' \n'Just saw you on TM. Good luck to you dear girl. You’re an inspiration, may the gods bless you!' a third chimed in. \nA fourth chimed in: 'Just watched you on ITV... what a star! Wishing you all the best for the future.' \nPre boasts an incredible 8.54k subscribers on YouTube. \nHer bio states: 'Hello! Welcome to my channel where I advocate for the stigmatized in disability all while having a positive outlook to life. \n'With having Multiple Sclerosis for 7 years, it's put things into perspective for me with what this disease continues to challenge me with from a young age. \n'With the content I share, I hope to shed light into what society has deemed to be abnormal to help educate and support those who have come across my channel.

Magazine.\n\nThey hailed the First Lady as a 'strong woman' with 'soft power' that they allege is 'really good at balancing her husband' President Donald Trump.\n\nIn her second term as First Lady, Melania is doubling down on her advocacy work, with her friends alleging her Be Best anti-cyberbullying initiative and her work with children in foster care are among her top priorities.\n\nMelania is said to be 'revamping' the presidential residence with close friend and renowned interior designer Tham Kannalikham, while also preserving the home's legacy.\n\nOffering rare insight into her 'cute' 20-year marriage with the President, Melania's allies have also claimed that Trump, 78 is a 'person who cares about his wife' and is 'happy to make her happy'.\n\nMelania has returned to her role as First Lady with 'strength and grace', her closest allies have revealed.\n\n'She's a different person than she was eight years ago and has always been true to herself,' her official photographer Regine Mahaux, who has worked with the Trumps since 2008, told Hello! Magazine. \n\n'She's always been hands-on, but she's more free nowadays to make a statement.' \n\nMahaux explained that although Melania, a former model, is nothing short of glamorous, she is also incredibly hardworking.\n\nThe Belgian photographer claims Melania often starts her day at 6.30am and will continue working until after midnight. She also dismissed any suggestions that the First Lady is not self-sufficient. \n\n'She will make a coffee for you herself. So, if you have a vision of a woman surrounded by servants, you are wrong,' said Mahaux. \n\nThe photographer highlighted Melania's resilience and confidence, noting how she continues to prioritize her duties to her country despite the whirlwind year that included her husband's political comeback and the loss of her mother.\n\n'There is something in her – the strong woman – but at the same time, there is the soft power,' she added. 'She's really good at balancing her husband.'\n\nSimilarly, Mahaux revealed the President strives to support his wife and 'make her happy', which she claims has been the case since she first started photographing the family 17 years ago.\n\n'He's happy to make her happy and that's something very cute,' she said of Trump. 'He's a person who cares about his wife, and that's what I see every morning and night. He loves to look at her.' \n\nKannalikham, who was chosen to help redecorate the White House, echoed the photographer's sentiment, reiterating Melania's commitment to her country.\n\n'Both Mrs. Trump and I were not born in America, yet we share a profound sense of attachment and responsibility to this country,' she explained. \n\n'We felt a deep obligation to give the White House the respect it deserves, understanding our role as stewards of this historic home.' \n\nIn addition to changes in the White House, Melania's wardrobe has seen a bit of revamp in comparison to her first term as First Lady.\n\nHer personal stylist, fashioner designer Hervé Pierre, has curated Melania's wardrobe to portray the power and dedication she brings to the job.\n\nHe has meticulously created her bold, headline-grabbing looks - including her show stopping, all black Inauguration Day outfit. \n\nBut Pierre does not do it alone, revealing to the magazine that Melania is heavily involved in crafting her iconic style.\n\n'A few times, she made this kind of zig-zag, up-in-the-air [gesture] to explain something sharp she had in mind. That was the beginning of something – it just needed to be translated on to paper,' he explained. \n\n'Even a person who doesn't really know how to sketch can easily scribble a zig-zag with a pencil and give a very accurate description of the dress.' \n\nHello's deep-dive into Melania's return to the White House comes just days after Vogue launched a vicious review of Melania's new White House portrait, comparing her look to that of a magician. \n\nThe magazine spent four years fawning over the previous White House administration, featuring both Jill Biden and Kamala Harris on the cover several times each, and its latest piece on Melania reaffirms their preference for Democrats. \n\nVogue's editor-in-chief Anna Wintour is a known Democrat - and was once even rumored to be considered for an ambassadorship under president Barack Obama.\n\n'Trump looked more like a freelance magician than a public servant,' wrote Hannah Jackson about the white-and-black portrait by Mahaux.\n\nJackson raged against the 'situationally inappropriate tuxedo' worn by Melania for the historic photograph, which shows the first lady in a power pose.\n\n'Trump’s clothing certainly didn’t help the boardroom pastiche,' Jackson continued. \n\n'Trump looked more like she was guest starring on an episode of The Apprentice than assuming the role of first lady of the United States.'\n\nJackson concluded: 'It’s perhaps unsurprising that a woman who lived in a gold-encrusted penthouse, whose fame is so intertwined with a reality television empire, would refuse to abandon theatrics—even when faced with 248 years of tradition.'\n\nThe black and white image was a big departure from former First Ladies, who have traditionally chosen much more colorful images.\n\nInstead, Melania - whose stylist Pierre has revealed in the past that it's difficult to dress her because many American designers refuse - showed off a black Dolce & Gabbana pantsuit with a white shirt. The Washington Monument was visible in the background.\n\nThe photo was taken on January 21, the day after the inauguration, in the Yellow Oval Room of the residence by Belgian photographer Mahaux.\n\nVogue famously excluded Melania from its pages while she was first lady, breaking its tradition of putting the presidents' wives on its coveted cover.\n\nMelania was secretly recorded in 2018 expressing rage that Vogue had not asked to feature her on its cover.\n\n'Vogue said like, oh, we want to do a profile. Profile? F*** you, profile. I don't need no profile. Yeah, what I need another profile? It might be a cover. I'm like, might be a cover? I don't give a f*** about Vogue and any magazine.'\n\nWhile Democratic first ladies such as Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton were put on the Vogue cover, Republicans such as Laura and Barbara Bush were not.","summary":"Melania Trump, 54, has stepped back into the spotlight feeling more confident and 'more free to make a statement' than she did eight years ago, her closest confidants told HELLO!

There was a complaint filed under something called the news distortion policy and that’s a 50-year-old policy at the FCC that applies to broadcasters, so not cable like Fox News, and the policy says you can’t, you know, swap answers out to make it look like somebody said something entirely different. The classic case of someone says yes to an answer and you splice in a no answer. Here it’s usually very difficult to make out news distortion complaints. You don’t want the FCC leaning in too heavily on this....It’s due today. And I expect CBS to provide it by the end of the day to see what in fact was said as part of our own news distortion investigation.\n\nAsked by Perino about potential “consequence[s],” Carr said the agency would be “open-minded” and thus CBS could be open to “the full suite of FCC options that are on the table that apply to any broadcast licensee.”\n\nHe also blasted his predecessor (Jessica Rosenworcel, appointed by President Barack Obama) for having “summarily dismissed this complaint, but I’m not sure how you can do that without seeing the actual video”\n\nPerino’s last question was exactly the right one: “[W]ill that transcript become public so all of us can read it or because of the investigation, do you hold onto it?”\n\nCarr first said he hadn’t “made a final decision,” but tipped his hand by acknowledging “transparency here is incredibly important” in which “the American public ultimately deserves to see this for themselves.”\n\n“And what’s interesting is CBS releases other transcripts. For instance, the Face the Nation interview recently with Vice President Vance? They released the full, unedited transcript there, but for some reason, they haven’t done it here,” he astutely noted.\n\nAs for the Trump lawsuit, The New York Times reported Thursday that “many executives at CBS’s parent company, Paramount, believe that settling the lawsuit would increase the odds that the Trump administration does not block or delay their planned multibillion-dollar merger with....Skydance, an entertainment company backed by the billionaire Larry Ellison and run by his son David.”\n\nThe Times added a settlement — which ABC agreed to with Trump over March 10, 2024 comments made by George Stephanopoulos — “could also cause an uproar within CBS News” that settling would be “tantamount to a politician’s standard-issue gripes about a news organization’s editorial judgment.”\n\nPuck’s Dylan Byers confirmed this possible scenario on Friday, calling it likely “[b]arring some unforeseen twist of fate” and it’d be “tens of millions of dollars to the Trump Presidential Library.”\n\nHe dished tea on the uproar among the bloodthirsty Trump haters at the network, specifically 60 Minutes and stalwarts Scott Pelley and Lesley Stahl (click “expand”):\n\nShari’s impending settlement has left CBS News journalists, and particularly 60 Minutes staff, in an uproar. Scott Pelley and Lesley Stahl, two of the most veteran 60 Minutes correspondents, are irate over the decision, according to their colleagues. Network sources say they would not be surprised to see some staffers resign or speak out publicly if and when the settlement is made. We’ll see. \n\nMeanwhile, some are questioning why CBS News C.E.O. Wendy McMahon and 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens are not standing up more forcefully for the news division. Many of those folks were already upset with McMahon and Owens for changes at Evening News (Owens is now E.P. on that show, too) that seem to leave little room for the day’s political news: “Bad enough we have a revamped national evening newscast barely covering the incredibly sweeping and consequential first full week of President Trump,” one correspondent texted me. “Now we get word we have an owner also eager to settle with him?”\n\nIn any event, the whole affair highlights the indignity of this particular moment in American journalism. It’s not enough that once-storied news organizations must suffer through the contractions of their newsrooms, the inexorable decline of their influence, the diminishment of talent salaries, and so forth.\n\nOn Sunday night, Semafor’s Max Tani reported “CBS News staff are bracing for an all-but-inevitable” settlement over the selectively edited Harris answers on Israel, which “virtually no one at the network actually believes was flawed” and would be an “ominous sign for a broadcast news industry[.]”\n\nTo see the relevant FNC transcript from February 3, click here.","summary":"By appearing Monday on the Fox News Channel’s America’s Newsroom, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr showed he’s not messing around by reminding CBS News that Monday was deadline day for them to turn over the full transcript of its October 2024 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nMonday could shape out to be quite the headache for CBS as the network was also barreling towards a possible settlement with former President Trump over a lawsuit he filed over said Harris lovefest in which answers were rearranged to make her more cogent.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAfter co-host Dana Perino played the clips in question, Carr explained where the FCC comes into play, specifically whether CBS violated its news distortion policy that broadcast networks are subjected to by being over-the-air (i.e. available via rabbit ears):\n\n\nWe have sought the unedited copy of the transcript and the video from this interview and it’s part of an FCC investigation.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy LAURA FOX FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:15:33 GMT, 3 February 2025 |Updated:15:45 GMT, 3 February 2025 \n\nThe much-anticipated Heart Rate challenge will make its return in Monday's Love Island: All Stars, with the boys and girls going head-to-head with a string of sexy performances.\nA fixture of the show since 2018, the challenge will see the girls slip into a string of scantily-clad looks to set pulses racing, while the boys hope to do the same by oiling up and stripping off.\nAnd while the villa will no doubt be sent into a frenzy by the challenge, it won't be without drama, as a shock kiss leaves one girl furious.\nKicking off the episode, Catherine gets a surprise text which reads: 'Islanders, it's time to get each other's hearts racing in tonight's boys vs girls challenge #SwayandSlay #HeartWorkPaysOff.'\nBoth teams are determined to give it their all with a series of sexy performances, and one girl particular is on a mission to win.\nSlipping into a sexy red mini-dress, Ekin-Su Culculoglu declares: 'I'm gonna kiss everyone, I'm Ekin-Su!'\n\nThe much-anticipated Heart Rate challenge will make its return in Monday's Love Island: All Stars, and Ekin-Su Culculoglu's shock kiss with Sammy Root throws the villa into chaos\n\nA fixture of the show since 2018, the challenge will see the girls slip into a string of scantily-clad looks to set pulses racing (Grace Jackson left and Gabby Allen right)\n\nCatherine Agbaje shows off her eye-popping curves in a daring black leather look as the girls kick off the challenge with their sexy dances\nBut after Elma points out it's not a kissing challenge, Ekin-Su mouths to her: 'I'm not gonna snog your man.'\nDown at the firepit, it's the girls first as Gabby wows the boys with her look and moves, Catherine dons a cat-like outfit much to Omar's delight and Grace leaves Luca speechless with her naughty angel get up. \nHarriett, dressed in a white lacey outfit, shows off her flexibility dropping into the splits, as Danielle makes a point to tease Curtis before walking away. \nElma and Tina get past their nerves but it's Ekin-Su that gives a finale to remember.\nBut in the heat of the moment, Ekin-Su pecks Sammy, which doesn't go down well with Elma.\nThe boys are next with Casey giving an animalistic performance in his signature speedos, Sammy wows Elma as a builder as he skips Ekin-Su after her kiss stunt, Ronnie has a wardrobe malfunction and can't rip off his trousers much to the girls' amusement and Luca is a lifeguard ready to rescue Grace. \nOmar is a fireman focussed on Catherine and Ron the lumberjack shows Danielle some attention. \nMeanwhile, Curtis is back in his signature samba outfit, giving a dazzling dance performance, before things get heated with Ekin-Su.\n\nThe challenge also sees Curtis Pritchard reprise his legendary Samba dance from his first Heart Rate challenge performance in 2019\n\nDanielle Sellers (left) and Ekin-Su (right) will go head-to-head to try and raise the boys' heart rates the most, after Curtis was torn between them\n\nSlipping into a sexy red mini-dress, Ekin-Su Culculoglu declares: ' I'm gonna kiss everyone, I'm Ekin-Su!'\n\nIt's no surprise that the girls' dance sends the boys into turmoil, and one in particular leaves them whipped into a frenzy\n\nElma Pazar (left) and Tina Stinnes (right) show off their own racy dance moves in sexy looks, though the former is left furious after Ekin-Su's smooch with Sammy\n\nOmar Nyame is a fireman focussed on Catherine, and the bombshell certainly delivers with his sexy performance\n\nThe boys are next with Casey giving an animalistic performance in his signature speedos\nAt the results, some Islanders are delighted by whose heart was raised by whom, while others are left green with envy. \nFor one couple in particular there could be trouble in paradise, as Elma confides in Catherine about Sammy's kiss with Ekin-Su.\nElma tells Catherine: 'Do you not think it's mad she [Ekin-Su] kissed him [Sammy]?...it's just weird if you're gonna kiss one kiss all, but you went out of your way to kiss Sammy... it made me feel weird about her.'\nCatherine calls Ekin-Su over and she says: 'I didn't snog him, I just pecked him…I didn't think that much of it…it's not that deep.'\nElma responds: 'To me it is that deep because he's the only person that you kissed out of everyone, apart from Curtis.'\nEkin-su says: 'I'm sorry if it's come across like that or if you feel a certain way…you're right to be upset with me…'\nElma feels hurt at Ekin-Su's actions, will she forgive and forget or could this be the end of their friendship?\nLater in the episode, viewers will also see the moment Ron Hall decides to quit the villa, becoming the second star in 24 hours to depart the show.\nRon gathers the boys as they're getting ready to tell them he's made a decision about his time in the Villa.\nRon admits: 'My time is done…'\nThe boys are shocked with Sammy telling him: 'You're going to be very missed.'\n\nFor one couple in particular there could be trouble in paradise, as Elma confides in Catherine about Sammy's kiss with Ekin-Su\n\nLater in the episode, viewers will also see the moment Ron Hall decides to quit the villa, becoming the second star in 24 hours to depart the show\nRon then gathers everyone at the firepit and tells all of his fellow Islanders: 'I just don't know whether that person is gonna come in for me…'\n\n Love Island's 10 most cringeworthy Heart Rate performances EVER as racy challenge returns \nDuring his first stint on Love Island in 2023, Ron was coupled up with Lana Jenkins and the pair made it to the final, before calling it quits on their romance three months after leaving the villa. \nMeanwhile, in the current series, Ron was initially paired up with Kaz Crossley, who soon had her head turned by newcomer Montel McKenzie.\nHe was then 'stolen' by bombshell Harriett Blackmore, before later admitting that he didn't fancy her.\nThe most recently recoupling saw Ron pick new girl Danielle Sellers, who had previously picked Curtis Pritchard after they formed a connection.\nHowever, in a big twist amid their break-up, Curtis chose to stick by Ekin-Su, leaving Ron with no choice but to pick Danielle. \nLove Island: All Stars airs tonight at 9pm on ITV2 and ITVX. \nEkin-Su CulculogluLove Island All
