They “poured money and institutional support into the No Kings protests,” for example — and these “weren’t fringe outbursts. In fact, they revealed the party’s core.” The Oversight Project compiled the Instagram activity of “one key protest organizer, a group called 50501,” and “tracked who its social media managers followed, and what emerged was a clear pattern of associations: communist, neo-Marxist, anti-American, and foreign-aligned groups.” “These protests didn’t bubble up from the grassroots. They were built from the same radical networks that have long tried to destabilize the country from within.”\n\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post’s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between.

All AI has “ideological” formulas — some, including concepts like critical race theory, transgenderism and DEI — “baked” into their code. “The question is not whether an AI system will be built upon a set of values; the question is which set of values the programmers will select.” Yet Trump’s EO stipulates that the government will purchase only software that is “’truth-seeking’ and committed to ‘ideological neutrality.’” The president and his advisers “have shifted the direction of artificial intelligence away from woke — and toward a vibrant American future.”\n\nFrom the right: A Kamala Run Scares the Left\n\n“California Democrats are rubbing their temples” at the thought of Kamala Harris running for governor, quips National Review’s Noah Rothman. She’d be the heavy favorite, but the ex-veep might owe that “less to her political acumen” than to “California voters’ bovine insouciance.” She’d have to defend Joe Biden and “her role in the failed” coverup of his decline. And “in the absence of any measurable charisma and “notable risks” to the party overall, many Dems are attacking her. One state-level official even says she’d ruin the party’s chance to “win the House and hold on to three seats that we just flipped in 2024.” So “Harris could get herself elected,” notes Rothman, “while still serving as a net negative for her party.”\n\nLegal expert: Media’s Russiagate Blinders\n\nNewly declassified material from the Russian collusion investigation reveals “how high-ranking officials in the Obama Administration seeded” the false collusion narrative “with the help of an eager, unquestioning press corps,” thunders Jonathan Turley at Fox News. Ex-CIA director John Brennan “was the key figure insisting on the inclusion of the Steele dossier” in the Russian interference assessment. Ex-FBI director James Comey knew “the Steele dossier was an unreliable political hit job,” yet he “lied to a federal court to maintain” the investigation. “The public is now learning about the real Russian conspiracy and its key players,” but “the same media that pushed the false claims” are “imposing a news blackout as they did with the Hunter Biden laptop.”\n\n— Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"Democratic leaders hoped to “reverse the party’s hard-left drift and reconnect with working-class voters” after the election, but Democrats instead ran “straight back into the arms of their radical base,” marvels Mike Howell at The Blaze.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/28/opinion/dems-failed-makeover-in-n-out-of-cali-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/2025-day-president-trumps-military-106533197.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-29 00:03:05","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.265},{"id":346086460,"title":"Did Trump prosecute Beyonce?

However, a July 27, 2025, report by CNN asserts that there is no evidence of Beyonce taking $11 million for anything related to Harris' campaign, let alone for the endorsement in question.Federal Election Commission records show that Beyonce's Parkwood Entertainment received $165,000 from Kamala Harris on November 19, 2024. However, it was recorded as \"campaign event production\" expense, and a Democrat spokesperson confirmed to Deadline last year that they were legally required to cover the costs incurred by the appearances of Beyonce.However, there is no evidence to suggest Bey ever took an eight-figure sum to endorse Harris's campaign. Fact-checking websites like PolitiFact and FactCheck.org have failed to find any basis behind the claim. Rumors of Beyonce taking a multi-million-dollar paycheck for endorsing Kamala Harris started spreading last year when several Trump supporters stood by the claim.On November 1, 2024, Queen Bey's publicist, Yvette Noel-Schure, spoke to PolitiFact and described the claims as \"beyond ridiculous.\"Read More: What did Azealia Banks say?

But federal races in North Carolina have proven elusive for Democrats, who have not won the state at either the Senate or presidential level since 2008.Cooper is viewed as a strong recruit for Democrats as he enjoyed strong approval ratings during his tenure leading the state.What To KnowCooper, who served as North Carolina's governor from 2017 to 2025 and previously held four terms as attorney general, ended months of speculation on Monday, and is now the latest candidate to seek the Democratic nomination for Tillis' seat.\"I have thought on it and prayed about it, and I have decided: I am running to be the next U.S. Senator from North Carolina,\" Cooper said in a video posted to X.Tillis spoke to the outlet NOTUS last week on the potential for Cooper to enter the race against Michael Whatley, the Republican National Committee (RNC) chair, who is endorsed by Trump but has yet to formally enter the race.\"It's going to be a knife fight in a telephone booth,\" Tillis said about the potential match-up.NOTUS reported that Tillis also said he hopes Whatley is up for the challenge of running.Cooper has touted his record of bipartisan governance, Medicaid expansion in 2023, and efforts to raise teacher pay, while asserting that the stakes for the middle class, healthcare, and economic policy are higher than ever.Polling has shown a statistical tie between Cooper and a generic Republican candidate, with each side holding 48 percent support among likely voters, according to a recent survey from co/efficient.What People Are SayingPolitical science professor at Columbia University, Robert Y. Shapiro, told Newsweek via email Monday: \"I can only say the obvious: The Democrats were looking for him to run. He is seen as a more moderate Democrat and he has shown he can win a major election already in the state as governor. He was considered a possible vice-presidential running mate for Kamala Harris. So has the requisite political and governing experience to win another statewide election.\"President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Thursday: \"To the Great People of North Carolina, one of the most capable executives in our Country successfully ran, along with Lara Trump, the Republican National Committee. He happens to live in your incredible State, which I love, and won, including Primaries, six times in a row! My relationship with you has been fantastic, and only enhanced by the job I did after January 20th, when I took over the flood drenched areas that were abandoned by Sleepy Joe Biden and your Governor, and, through the infusion of money and hard work, fixed the problem like nobody else has the ability to do.\"He continued: \"The one that energized that project, and so many more, was the Chairman of the RNC, Michael Whatley. I am sending this Statement out for a very good reason. Mike would make an unbelievable Senator from North Carolina. He is fantastic at everything he does, and he was certainly great at the RNC where, in the Presidential Election, we won every Swing State, the Popular Vote, and the Electoral College by a landslide! But I have a mission for my friends in North Carolina, and that is to get Michael Whatley to run for the U.S. Senate. He is STRONG on the Border, stopping Crime, supporting our Military/Veterans, cutting Taxes, and saving our always under siege Second Amendment.\"\"I need him in Washington, and I need him representing YOU! Fortunately, I have somebody who will do a wonderful job as the Chairman of the RNC,\" Trump concluded. \"His name is, Joe Gruters, and he will have my Complete and Total Endorsement. So, should Michael Whatley run for the Senate, please let this notification represent my Complete and Total Endorsement.

Epstein who?\n\nBut there are three reasons why this particular video — not made by the president but amplified to thousands — is worth noting, and maybe even worth fearing.\n\nFirst, it is flat-out racist. In it, Obama is ripped out of a chair in the Oval Office and forced onto his knees, almost bowing, to a laughing Trump. That imagery isn't hard to interpret: America's most esteemed Black man — who recently warned we are on the brink of losing democracy — forced into submission before our current leader.\n\nThe video comes as Trump claims that Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, has uncovered a \"treasonous conspiracy in 2016\" in which top Obama officials colluded with Russia to disrupt the election. Democrats say the claim is erroneous at best.\n\nIf you are inclined to give Trump the benefit of the doubt, right before this scene of Obama being forced to kneel, a meme of Pepe the Frog — an iconic image of the far-right and white supremacy — flashes on the screen.\n\nNot subtle. But also, not the first time racism has come straight from the White House. Rev. Amos Brown, pastor of San Francisco's Third Baptist Church and a student of Martin Luther King Jr., reminded me that once upon a time, then-President Woodrow Wilson screened the pro-KKK film \"The Birth of a Nation\" at the executive mansion. It was the first film screening ever held there, and its anti-Black viewpoint sparked controversy and protests.\n\nThat was due in no small part to a truth that Hollywood knows well — fiction has great power to sway minds. Brown sees direct similarities in how Wilson amplified fictional anti-Blackness then, and how Trump is doing so now, both for political gain.\n\n\"Mr. Trump should realize that Obama hasn't done anything to him. But just the idea, the thought of a Black person being human, is a threat to him and his supporters,\" Brown told me.\n\nBrown said he's praying for the president to \"stop this bigotry\" and see the error of his ways. I'll pray the great gods give the reverend good luck on that.\n\nBut, on the earthly plane, Brown said that \"the more things change, the more they remain the same.\"\n\nTrump courted the Black vote and has his supporters among people of all colors and ethnicities, but he's also played on racist tropes for political success, from stoking fear around the Central Park Five, now known as the Exonerated Five, decades ago to stoking fear around Black immigrants eating cats and dogs in Ohio during the recent election. It's an old playbook, because it works.\n\nReposting the image of Obama on his knees is scary because it's a harsh reminder that racism is no longer an undercurrent in our society, if it ever was. It's a motivator and a power to be openly wielded — just the way Wilson did back in 1915.\n\nBut the differences in media from back in the day to now are what should raise our second fear around this video. A fictional film is one thing. An AI-generated video that for many people seems to depict reality is a whole new level of, well, reality.\n\nThe fear of deepfakes in politics is not new. It's a global problem, and in fairness, this isn't the first time (by far) Trump or other politicians have used deepfakes.\n\nTrump last year reposted an image of Taylor Swift endorsing him (which never happened). Also last year, during the election and the height of the Elon Musk-Trump bromance, the billionaire posted a fake photo of political challenger Kamala Harris dressed in what looked like a communist military uniform.\n\nTrump himself has not been immune. In 2023, Eliot Higgins, the founder of the investigative outlet Bellingcat, said he was toying with an AI tool and created images of Trump being arrested, never thinking it would go viral (especially since one image gave Trump three legs).\n\nOf course it did, and millions of people looked at these fake pictures, at least some assuming they were real.\n\nThe list of deepfake political examples is long and ominous. Which brings us to the third reason Trump's latest use of one is unsettling.\n\nHe clearly sees the effectiveness of manipulating race and reality to increase his own power and further his own agenda.\n\nObama on his knees strikes a chord all too close to the image of Latino Sen. Alex Padilla being taken to the floor by federal authorities a few weeks ago during a news conference. It bears a chilling resemblance to the thousands of images flooding us daily of immigrants being taken down and detained by immigration officers in often violent fashion.\n\nVideos like this one of Obama are the normalizing, the mockery, the celebration of the erosion of civil rights we are currently seeing being aimed at Black, brown and vulnerable Americans.\n\nThere is nothing innocent or unplanned about these kinds of videos. They are a political weapon being used for a purpose.\n\nBecause when repetition dulls our shock of them, how long before we are no longer shocked by real images of real arrests?","summary":"Recently, our thoughtful and reserved president reposted on his Truth Social site a video generated by artificial intelligence that falsely showed former President Barack Obama being arrested and imprisoned.","url":"https://www.keenesentinel.com/opinion/op-ed/guest-opinion-what-should-scare-us-about-trumps-fake-video-of-obama-by-anita-chabria/article_c1b78472-1575-4627-a5a0-5c2c8125a0f3.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/keenesentinel.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6260defe-c779-11ef-bd8a-c733c01e3345.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-28 21:30:00","author":"Anita Chabria","authors":["Anita Chabria"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.026},{"id":346066066,"title":"Washington Post fact checker Glenn Kessler takes buyout after nearly 3 decades – and paper has no replacement","text":"The man behind The Washington Post’s “Pinocchios” is leaving the paper without anyone to fill his shoes. \n\nGlenn Kessler, the editor of The Fact Checker, announced Monday he has taken a buyout, ending his lengthy career at the Post. \n\n“After more than 27 years at The Washington Post, including almost 15 as The Fact Checker, I will be leaving on July 31, having taken a buyout,” Kessler wrote on his Facebook page. “Much as I would have liked to keep scrutinizing politicians in Washington, especially in this era, the financial considerations were impossible to dismiss.”\n\nKessler said he wrote or edited more than 3,000 fact checks as editor and chief writer of The Fact Checker. \n\n“When I started in 2011, there were only a handful of fact-checking organizations around the world, and I have been thrilled to watch the movement expand across the globe. So many of these brave and diligent fact checkers have become good friends,” Kessler wrote. \n\n“My fact checks were routinely the most-read articles on The Post’s website. I had my detractors, from both the left and right, but many readers appreciated my efforts to sort out the truth in political rhetoric,” he added. \n\nKessler revealed he attempted to stay on a contract basis long enough for his bosses to find a successor for a smooth transition, to no avail. \n\n“I didn’t want The Post to have a gap in fact-checking coverage during this fraught period in U.S. history. But we couldn’t work out an agreement,” he wrote. \n\nWashington Post executive editor Matt Murray appeared onboard with hiring a new fact checker in an exchange with Kessler, according to a source familiar with the matter. \n\nKessler’s next chapter will involve him writing books, and he’s open to freelance and consulting work.\n\n“In 2018, when the Fact Checker team was compiling a database of more than 30,000 Trump claims, I told the New York Times that ‘I have the best job in journalism,'” Kessler wrote. “I still believe that, and I’m sorry to leave without a replacement lined up. But it’s the right time for me. I hope The Post finds someone to carry on this important project.”\n\nThe Washington Post did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment. \n\nMurray implemented a new round of the paper’s Voluntary Separation Program (VSP) in May, hoping that most veteran staffers would be enticed by the exit offer. The program is set to end this week. \n\nAccording to a VSP document previously viewed by Fox News Digital, nine months of base pay would be given to staffers employed for 10-15 years, 12 months of base pay for 15-20-year veterans, 15 months of base pay for 20-25-year veterans and 18 months for anyone who has worked at the Post for more than 25 years. All of them would also receive 12 months of pay credit in their Separate Retirement Account (SRA). \n\nOther high-profile writers who’ve taken the buyouts include columnists Jonathan Capehart, Catherine Rampell, Philip Bump and Joe Davidson.\n\nAlso fueling the exodus from the editorial pages was the initiative by the Post’s billionaire owner Jeff Bezos to promote “personal liberties and free markets” and vowing not to publish pieces opposing those principles. \n\nBezos’ directive, which was announced in February, led to the immediate resignation of Post opinion editor David Shipley. Others resigned in protest and a mass cancellation of subscriptions by liberal leaders rocked the paper. The paper faced similar backlash last fall when Bezos blocked the paper’s endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris shortly before the election.\n\nEarlier this month, Washington Post CEO Will Lewis sent a memo to staff issuing an ultimatum for those contemplating adapting to the paper’s new direction. \n\nAlso fueling the exodus from the editorial pages was the initiative by the Post’s billionaire owner Jeff Bezos to promote “personal liberties and free markets” and vowing not to publish pieces opposing those principles. \n\nBezos’ directive, which was announced in February, led to the immediate resignation of Post opinion editor David Shipley.

Jan Schakowsky (D-IL).\n\n“I’m thrilled to endorse Kat Abughazeleh,” Khanna said in a statement. “I look forward to working with Kat when she’s elected, so that together we can defeat Donald Trump’s inhumane agenda and focus on the most pressing issues facing working people.”\n\nThe 2026 election is an opportunity for the Democratic Party to gain more information on Gen Z voters, Khanna said. While some newer voters in the party support a more moderate direction, others have echoed Khanna’s populist sentiment.\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, former Vice President Kamala Harris was up 4 percentage points with voters ages 18-29. However, by gender, 7% fewer young women and 14% fewer young men voted for the Democratic nominee compared to 2020, according to research from Tufts University.\n\nYoung male voters were a large contributor to Trump’s 2024 win. Now, Democratic lawmakers, including Gov. Wes Moore (D-MD), hope to better understand this voter demographic so that the Democratic Party can “win them back.”\n\nAt the Voters of Tomorrow Summit for Young Progressives on Friday, Khanna echoed his goals for a more transparent and reliable Democratic Party, hoping to pull in younger voters.\n\n“I’ll end with this clear point: The old guard needs to go,” Khanna said. “The old ways have not been working. This party needs a new rebirth. This party needs a rebirth to stand for human rights. This party needs a rebirth to stand for the working class. This party needs a rebirth to stand for the people over the donor class.”\n\nThe average age of members in the House is 57.5 years, down from 57.9 in the 118th Congress.

Netizens accuse streamer of inciting \"political violence\"","text":"Twitch streamer and political commentator Hasan \"HasanAbi\" Piker has been vocal about his thoughts against the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) system, and has appeared in solidarity with movements against the agency. Notably, he streamed live from the June 2025 Los Angeles anti-ICE protests. Now, on July 27, 2025, the streamer was seen speaking at yet another anti-ICE gathering.A viral TikTok clip shows HasanAbi standing on stage at the rally, alongside journalist and opinion columnist Taylor Lorenz. In the clip, Piker echoes a sentiment opposing traditional capitalistic ideologies as he empathizes with the audience, mentioning how they were victims of their \"bosses\" and \"landlords\":\"For the most part, it's your landlord, it's your bosses that are f**king you over, it's capital owners that are f**king you over, and I think this is a unique opportunity to get even Deborahs and Barbaras on board with that, like white wine moms. And [Lorenz] actually wrote about this; it was a great video, where you talked about, y'know, someone has to do it.\"Regarding the \"it\" factor, HasanAbi seemingly referenced a May 2025 YouTube upload from Lorenz titled, 'Somebody needs to do it.' Here, the journalist mentioned an online trend, featuring certain netizens asking for somebody to do \"it.\" At the 1:22 minute mark, Lorenz explained to those unaware that \"it\" points to the assassination of the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump.\"But in case you are somehow still in the dark, these memes are about unaliving Trump, and sorry to say, in very dumb [algorithmic] terms, but I don't want this video to get taken down from YouTube.\"HasanAbi mentioned Lorenz's video at the rally and touched on the phrase's hidden meaning:\"When I say that, everyone knows exactly what I mean.\"Netizens on Reddit's r/LivestreamFail commented under a clip of political commentator Steven \"Destiny's\" reaction to HasanAbi's speech, and some, like u/supersaiyanswanso, claimed that the Twitch streamer is only a herald for such action and never gets involved himself:\"He's always the first to call for it, but will never do anything other than be an instigator. Lol.\"u/Fantastic-Put-7671, who originally posted the now-deleted clip, claimed that Piker's message aimed to incite chaos:\"Hasan calling for Political violence again 'somebody should do it'.\"Others called out HasanAbi for being contradictory in his speech, mentioning his status as a property owner, considering he reportedly owns a $3 million home in Los Angeles:\"He is the property owner calling for his own 'do it',\" said u/pepperonituna.\"Say it with me now, champagne socialist,\" said u/DayDreamerJon.\"This is so crazy\": Destiny speaks on HasanAbi's speech at the anti-ICE rallyDestiny, in reaction, suggested that HasanAbi's comments aimed to get people riled up against capital owners in societ. He also claimed that the streamer's comments are untimely considering certain other acts of politically driven violence:\"Like, this is so crazy... after two Jewish people were assassinated by some guy screaming 'Free Palestine,' two Democratic lawmakers were assassinated by some f**king crazy MAGA dude, and now, it's like, the people we really need to be killing are landlords and capital owners.\"For context, the long-standing feud between Hasan and Destiny started in July 2019 when the latter publicly challenged what he saw as misinformation in HasanAbi’s Kamala Harris video. This led to a heated debate and rapid escalation into mutual accusations of bad‑faith tactics and betrayal.r/LivestreamFail moderators seemingly took down the post after 15 hours of staying up and mentioned, in a comment, that both the post's title and Destiny's interpretation were misleading:\"...the 'it' being an implicitly understood idea with regards to a sitting president, but for most platform purposes, the 'it' cannot be described.

These switches can be made easily on a 3D printer and installed in minutes with a screwdriver. \n\nMore than two dozen states, including California, have banned Glock switches. If the bill is passed, it would make California the first state in the country to ban Glocks outright. A similar bill in New York has stalled in the state Senate. \n\nCritics argue AB1127 infringes on Second Amendment rights and sets a dangerous precedent for broader gun restrictions in the future. Supporters say that the legislation focuses narrowly on a specific category of firearms increasingly linked to violent crimes.\n\nThe use of homemade switches has skyrocketed in recent years, and guns equipped with them are becoming the weapon of choice for criminals, Gabriel said.\n\nOne high-profile example was the 2022 nightclub gang shooting just blocks from the California State Capitol Building. More than 100 rounds were fired as people poured out into the streets, scattered, and ran for cover. In the end, six people were killed and a dozen were wounded. \n\n“As parents and lawmakers, we refuse to stand idly by while our schools and communities are being threatened by illegal machine guns,” Gabriel said. “This commonsense legislation will ensure that the gun industry is held accountable and that we are doing everything possible to protect our communities from mass shootings.”\n\nGabriel’s bill, referred to as the “Glock ban bill,” is backed by Democrats. It passed the state assembly last month and is now in the Senate. It could be headed for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D-CA) desk soon. While Democrats have a supermajority in the California legislature, Newsom has not indicated whether he would sign the bill. Several anti-gun groups have been campaigning to get the legislation passed.\n\n“No one needs a pistol that can be turned into a machine gun,” Pedro Ventura, a volunteer with Moms Demand Action in California, said. “Banning Glock switches was a good start, but the threat has grown. These devices are easier to get and deadlier than ever. AB 1127 steps up by holding gun makers accountable. If they won’t modify the design, they can’t sell the gun. It’s that simple.… We urge the Senate to get this bill across the finish line.”\n\nAlex Lopez, a gunsmith at Western Firearms, believes California should go after criminals who break the law and not the gun companies. \n\n“For decades, Glock pistols have been a staple for law-abiding citizens, law enforcement, and military personnel,” he wrote. “They’re reliable, affordable, and trusted. Under this proposed law, models like the Glock 17 and 19—iconic firearms used nationwide—could be banned from commercial sale in California, despite no wrongdoing by manufacturers or lawful owners. What makes this bill especially frustrating is that Glock switches are already illegal under both federal and California law. Instead of cracking down on criminals using illegal devices, AB 1127 targets responsible dealers and customers who follow the rules.”\n\nGlocks are among the most popular handguns in the state, with more than a million already in circulation. Last year, former Vice President Kamala Harris told 60 Minutes she had one and had shot it.\n\nNewsom, who has signed some of the nation’s strongest gun control laws, was recently gifted a Sig Sauer P365-Xmacro pistol from conservative podcast host Shawn Ryan. The governor, an early 2028 Democratic presidential contender, was a guest on Ryan’s podcast. \n\n“Everybody gets a gift,” Ryan said before presenting Newsom with the gun. \n\n“Brother, this is fabulous,” Newsom said. “The last thing people would expect is that I respect this gift.” \n\nJUDGE BLOCKS PLANNED PARENTHOOD DEFUNDING PROVISION OF ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL ACT \n\n“Really?” Ryan asked. \n\n“Yeah, man.

I could see an outsider Democrat being able to message this. I think it’s a tough place for her to be,” Todd said at the time. “If I were advising her, I’d tell her: go throw yourself into the rebuild of LA and get involved with the LA Olympic Committee. Be above politics for a couple of years and come back maybe in 2030 or 2032.”\n\nMultiple individuals who have talked to the former vice president told CNN she has solicited their opinions on whether she should pursue the governorship, the outlet reported on Sunday. Multiple close Harris allies told The New York Times in April that she was more inclined to seek the governorship in 2026 than the presidency again in 2028.\n\nHarris lost all seven battleground states and the popular vote to President Donald Trump in November.

That is, guests who included Kim Kardshian, Kylie Jenner, Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.\n\nOn Saturday, Eve Jobs, 27, married British Olympic gold medal equestrian Harry Charles, 26. The couple tied the knot in a historic church that dates back to the Norman Conquest, in the picturesque Cotswolds region of England. This guest list also was pretty packed with some powerful people, as well as nepo baby friends of the bride.\n\nFor the Jobs wedding, former vice president and 2024 presidential candidate Harris made another appearance at one of the summer’s major weddings. Harris is a close friend of the bride’s mother, Laurene Powell Jobs, according to Vanity Fair. Harris also hosted a pre-wedding dinner party at a local pub, according to Hello! magazine.\n\nMeanwhile, Sofia Abramovich, the daughter of Roman Abramovich, the controversial Russian billionaire oligarch, also was a guest, the Daily Mail reported. Sofia Abramovich, who shares Eve Jobs and Harry Charles’ love of horses, is known to enjoy a pretty luxurious lifestyle in the U.K. even though her father was sanctioned in 2022 for his ties to Vladimir Putin after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Mirror reported. \n\nEve Jobs, a 2021 graduate of Stanford University, and her groom also are friends with Bruce Springsteen’s daughter, Jessica, and Eve Jobs made her one of her nine bridesmaids, all of whom wore red, satin cocktail gowns for bridesmaids’ dresses. Jennifer Gates Nassar, the eldest daughter of billionaire Bill Gates and ex-wife Melinda French Gates, also attended. Other famous attendees came from the British royal family: Princess Beatrice and her husband Edo, the Daily Mail said.\n\nThe various festivities for the multi-day affair were coordinated by San Francisco-based events and arts magnate Stanlee Gatti, according to Vanity Fair.\n\nA possibly curious addition to the guest list was Kourtney Kardashian, Vanity Fair also reported. She was one of the few members of the Kardashian/Jenner family to skip the Venice wedding of Bezos and Sánchez. But somehow, she found her way to the Jobs wedding. She let it be known that she was in the Costwolds the same weekend as the Jobs wedding by posting images from her trip, including what appears to be table decorations from one of the wedding events, Vanity Fair reported.","summary":"The wedding of the Apple heiress in the English countryside was the second major wedding this summer attended by former Vice President Harris and it included an assortment of her high-society friends, including Roman Abramovich's daughter.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/07/28/eve-jobs-wedding-guests-included-kamala-harris-an-oligarchs-daughter/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/EveJobs2.jpeg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-28 19:07:31","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.815},{"id":346043782,"title":"Donald Trump bizarrely demands Beyonce is ‘prosecuted’ for supporting Kamala Harris","text":"Donald Trump demanded that Beyonce is ‘prosecuted’ (Pictures: EPA / Getty)\n\nDonald Trump has bizarrely called for Beyonce to be prosecuted – over disputed claims regarding endorsements.\n\nMonths after he claimed victory in the 2024 election, the President is clearly still smarting over the string of names that stepped up to endorse Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nIn fact, months after theories arose on social media that Queen Bey was paid $10million for her appearance at a rally in Houston, the 79-year-old alleged that she broke the law by taking a multi-million-dollar pay cheque.\n\nTaking to Truth Social over the weekend, he fumed: ‘I’m looking at the large amount of money owed by the Democrats after the presidential election and the fact that they admit to paying, probably illegally, $11million to singer Beyoncé for an ENDORSEMENT (she never sang, not one note, and left the stage to a booing and angry audience!).’\n\nThe former TV star also called out alleged endorsements to Oprah Winfrey and activist Al Sharpton ‘for doing absolutely nothing’.\n\n‘These ridiculous fees were incorrectly stated in the books and records,’ he continued. ‘YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PAY FOR AN ENDORSEMENT.

We must vote, and we need you.’\n\nAccording to CNN, spending records for the campaign do show a payment of $165,000 to Beyonce’s production company, which was listed as a ‘campaign event production’ expense.\n\nThis comes after a spokesperson for the campaign previously told Deadline that they were required by law to cover costs related to a celebrity endorser’s appearance, but would not pay for the stars themselves.\n\nSenior advisor and spokesperson Adrienne Elrod insisted: ‘We do not pay. We have never paid any artist and performer.

He said U.S. exports would face no tariffs in EU countries.\n\nTrump met on Monday at his Turnberry club with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whose government has been seeking to bring down 25 percent Trump-imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\nTrump got asked after his meeting if he would do anything to help British steel and aluminum manufacturers who might get hit, and when his tariff might come down to zero on that sector.\n\n'We're a big buyer of steel. But we're going to make our own steel. We're going to make our own aluminum,' he said.\n\nEarlier Monday, before his meeting began, Trump also avoided details when the Daily Mail asked if he was going to come down on steel and aluminum. The White House had identified that as a top ask Trump might face at Turnberry.\n\n'They did a great job,' Trump said, speaking in generalities while a bagpiper welcoming his guest played. 'They've been trying to make that deal for 12 years.'\n\nTrump also continues to brandish trade talks as a political weapon – in one case, pressing Cambodia and Thailand to stop cross-border attacks.\n\n'That was going to be a very bad war,' Trump said. He said everything was 'settled.' \n\nLater, Trump wrote on Truth Social that both countries had agreed to a 'ceasefire and peace.' He said he had instructed his team to restart trade negotiations with them.\n\nThat leaves India, Brazil, and South Korea as among the major economies with no deal yet.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump announced he had reached a 'very powerful' trade deal with the European Union that would lower barriers to U.S. exports and bring new European investments into the U.S.\n\nSpeaking from his Turnberry golf course, Trump said European Union countries would purchase $750 billion of energy from the U.S., and provide an additional $600 billion in U.S. investments. \n\n'All of the countries will be opened up to trade with the United States at zero tariff, and they're agreeing to purchase a vast amount of military equipment,' Trump added. 'We don't know what that number is.'\n\nIt came after Trump inveighed against 'one-sided' trade with Europe as he sat down at his Turnberry golf course with the EU Commission president, while raging against windmills and saying there were prospects for reaching a deal imminently. \n\n'We wanted to rebalance the trade relations,' said EU Commission Chair Ursula von der Leyen, confirming the agreement while sitting alongside Trump.\n\nTrump flashed his anger when a reporter asked if turmoil over the Jeffrey Epstein story had contributed to the rush to get the deal done. \n\n'Oh, you've got to be kidding. No – had nothing to do with it. Only you would make that. That had nothing to do with it,' Trump responded.\n\nBoth leaders made nice – after the 'Liberation Day' tariffs Trump rolled out in April threatened to cleave the powerful allies. Trump had more recently threatened a 30 percent tariff on the EU – providing an incentive to negotiate it down. Trump upon arriving here in Scotland said the powerful trade bloc must 'buy down' the number. \n\n'Basically the European market is open,' said von der Leyen. 'It's 450 million people, so it's a good deal. It's a huge deal. Was tough negotiations. I knew it at the beginning, and it was indeed very tough, but we came to a good conclusion from both sides,' she said.\n\nThe number comports with what had already been floated. \n\n'We are agreeing that the tariff straight across for automobiles and everything else' would be 15 percent, said Trump.\n\nThe agreement – with details still to be revealed – comes after Trump announced other agreements with Japan and other nations, while firing off a series of trade 'letters' announcing new tariffs he is imposing on other nations. \n\nJapan, too, would face a 15 percent rate on its auto exports to the U.S. \n\nAfter many economists warned that Trump's tariffs could break the alliance, the two leaders proclaimed new cooperation after they had agreed to broad terms.\n\n'This deal will bring us very close together actually. It's a partnership in a sense,' Trump said.\n\nThe progress came about an hour after Trump complained about the trade relationship.\n\n'It's been a very one-sided transaction – very unfair to the United States,' he complained alongside von der Leyen, keeping her hands in her lap and her expressions muted.\n\n'It's been a very, very one-sided deal, and it shouldn't be,' Trump fumed. He said a deal, if it can be reached, would be the biggest deal 'ever struck by anybody.'\n\n'This is the biggest deal. People don't realize – this is bigger than any other deal. And it could happen – should happen,' he said.\n\nFielding questions at a press event that put the 'working' in what his team calls a 'working visit,' Trump went off on a number of topics.\n\nHis attacks quickly changed to wind turbines he said obstructs the view from his Scottish golf course. \n\n'It ruins the landscape it kills the birds. They're noisy,' Trump complained.\n\nHe said what he terms windmills in Massachusetts were 'driving them loco – driving them crazy.'\n\n'Today I'm playing the best course, I think, in the world: Turnberry ... And I look over the horizon and I see nine windmills. I say isn't that a shame,' he said.\n\nOn immigration, another tension point, Trump said: 'We've sealed our borders. We have nobody coming in ... I think they're going to end up in the same place. You might as well go there quicker.'\n\nVon Leyen shared his assessment on the chance of reaching an agreement, putting it at 50 percent.\n\nTrump got asked at one point if he could do better than 15 percent – the amount of a tariff on European imports that has been floated as a potential final number in an agreement. \n\n'Better meaning lower? No,' Trump said flatly.\n\nBut the former German politician showed some give in her own remarks, and kept her composure even as Trump tore into European policies on trade, energy, and immigration.\n\n'I think the President is right. You have a 50 percent chance to strike a deal. And indeed, it is about rebalancing. So you can call it fairness, you can call it rebalancing.'\n\nShe continued: 'United States has a deficit, and we have to re balance it. We have an excellent trade relations – tt's a huge volume on trade that we have together. So we will make it more sustainable. \n\nThe two leaders sat in the Donald J. Trump ballroom – one Trump said he wishes he could simply drop down inside the White House, where he has plans for a new ballroom.\n\n'You know, we just built this ballroom, and we're building a great ballroom at the White House. The White House has wanted a ballroom for 150 years, but they never had a real estate person,' he said.\n\nHe called the ballroom, which is named for himself, 'quite the success.'\n\n'I could take this one, drop it right down there, and it would be beautiful,' Trump said.\n\nThe trade talk comes a day before Trump is set to sit down with British PM Keir Starmer, amid indications that Trump's love of pomp and pageantry could be working to his host county's benefit. \n\nHe also complained that the U.S. doesn't get enough credit to approving food aid for Gaza, amid growing hunger and signs of starvation as Israel paused military action. \n\n'Nobody acknowledged it. Nobody talks about it,' Trump complained.\n\n'The US is going to do more aid for Gaza but we'd like to have other countries participate,' Trump said. \n\nThe meeting came after Trump spent a second day on his Turnberry golf course Sunday – after raging at rivals from Democrats to Beyonce overnight. \n\nThis time, he golfed just with his son Eric, despite touting a littany of big shots he said would be staying at his private course.\n\n'We'll have numerous executives that we're meeting with – lot of them. We're going to be meeting with a lot of people. A lot of people will be staying at Turnberry,' Trump said after landing Friday night.\n\nHis aides are calling it a 'working visit' – although he has made time to play his course for two successive days. \n\nThere is a typically massive security footprint – including the rollout of a new armoured golf court after a phalanx of agents swept his course in search of potential security threats. \n\nThe last minute addition to his schedule has Trump going toe-to-toe with a top European leader days after he said there was a 'fifty-fifty' chance of reaching a trade deal.\n\nIf Trump wanted to send a message about what kind of contender she was dealing with, he posted a short video of himself swinging a driver at one of the tees on his Turnberry course.\n\nTrump also put in plug by golf legend Gary Player, quoting him as saying 'Turnberry is, without a question, in the Top Five Greatest Golf Courses I've ever played in my 73 years as a pro.'\n\n'Thank you, Gary!' Trump added.\n\nNot all of his musings were upbeat – on a trip that Trump began by railing against wind turbines and illegal immigration.\n\nTrump used his site to fire at Democrats about the 2024 election, after spending part of the week accusing President Barack Obama of 'treason' after his administration released declassified documents about Russian election interference intelligence assessments.\n\n'I'm looking at the large amount of money owed by the Democrats, after the Presidential Election, and the fact that they admit to paying, probably illegally, $11 million to singer Beyoncé for an endorsement (she never sang, not one note, and left the stage to a booing and angry audience!), $3 million for 'expenses,' to Oprah, $600,000 to very low rated TV 'anchor,' Al Sharpton (a total lightweight!), and others to be named for doing, absolutely nothing!' he wrote, sprinkling in all-caps.\n\nThe Kamala Harris campaign has long denied paying for any endorsements. Oprah Winfrey has said she was 'not paid a time' to appear with Harris, although the campaign picked up production costs of the event. FEC filings show the Harris camp gave $165,000 to Beyonce's production company, Parkwood Production Media LLC,\n\nTrump called it 'totally illegal to pay for an endorsement and added that 'Kamala, and all those that received endorsement money, broke the law,' again using all caps.","summary":"President Donald Trump levied a fresh threat to countries that have yet to announce trade deals with the U.S. with just four days to go before his new August 1 'doomsday' deadline.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14948125/Trump-issues-final-trade-deal-threat-four-days-price-hike-doomsday.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/28/17/100706659-0-image-m-19_1753721891851.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/07/27/2364375127564140309/1024x576_MP4_2364375127564140309.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-28 17:34:15","author":"Editor,Geoff Earle","authors":["Editor","Geoff Earle"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.032},{"id":346060712,"title":"Piers Morgan calls America's late-night hosts 'activist hacks for the Democrats'","text":"U.K. journalist Piers Morgan believes late-night TV in the United States has shifted from comedy to “partisan political activism.” \n\n In an X post on Sunday, the media personality shared a New York Post cover story with the headline “The Left Show with Stephen Colbert” that cited a study that claimed the late-night program has featured 176 left-leaning guests and only one Republican since 2022. \n\n “This is so damning,” Morgan wrote. “Most of America’s biggest late-night hosts have become nothing more than hyper-partisan activist hacks for the Democrats — a party that’s rarely been more unpopular. No wonder Colbert got canned. More will follow.” \n\n The 60-year-old television presenter faced pushback from other political commentators online like Brian Tyler Cohen, who wrote that it was “incredibly disappointing” to see Morgan claim “that the president can use his power to dictate what his critics can or cannot say on television.”\n\n Morgan responded, “Trump didn’t cancel Colbert… he cancelled himself with poor ratings, huge costs, and boring viewers with anti-Trump bias.” \n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n CBS announced earlier this month that the Late Show franchise will end after more than three decades in May 2026, with Colbert serving as its final host. Although the network said the cancellation was \"purely a financial\" decision, critics have questioned if the then-pending merger of CBS parent company Paramount Global to Skydance Media, which required the approval of the Trump administration, played a part. The FCC approved the merger on July 24, eight days after Colbert announced the cancellation on the show.\n\n President Donald Trump celebrated the Late Show's ending on social media, writing that \"I absolutely love that Colbert’ got fired\" and that the host's \"talent was even less than his ratings.\" He later claimed that Jimmy Kimmel, host of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and Jimmy Fallon of The Tonight Show would be the “next to go,” and that he hoped he “played a major part” in their dismissal. \n\n Trump's appointed FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, has also trolled Democrats over The Late Show's cancellation and talked about potential \"consequences\" for The View after cohost Joy Behar poked fun at the president.\n\n In a subsequent X post, Morgan also blasted Last Week Tonight host John Oliver’s recent 60 Minutes interview, during which the comedian addressed his choice to encourage viewers to vote for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. \n\n “UPDATE: Just watched a drooling @60Minutes segment tonight about John Oliver who was proud of telling his viewers not to vote for Trump at last election,” Morgan wrote. “He told them to vote for Kamala Harris instead. That’s not comedy, it’s partisan political activism.” \n\n When another individual called him out for supporting Trump in the 2016 and 2024 elections, Morgan replied, \"I never told Americans how to vote… I just predicted Trump would win those elections.” \n\n He also voiced his support for Jay Leno’s recent remarks about how late-night hosts “alienate” their audiences with their political jokes, writing, “He’s so right.” \n\n The former Tonight Show host explained in a recent interview with The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation that while he loved political humor, “people wind up cozying too much to one side or the other” these days. \n\n \"I don’t think anybody wants to hear a lecture,\" Leno said. \"Why shoot for just half an audience? Why not try to get the whole? I like to bring people into the big picture. I don't understand why you would alienate one particular group. Or just don't do it at all. I'm not saying you have to throw your support [on one side].

We can’t stand for that.'\n\nImages taken at the protest show a small number gathering outside of the building, holding banners and placards, some which said 'I'm with Colbert'. A video taken at the scene also shows the low turnout.\n\nCBS said the move to axe Colbert was due to low viewership and a decline in profits, but critics believe the network crumbled under pressure from President Trump. \n\nParamount, which owns CBS, decided to settle for $16 million on a suit over deceptive editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris filed by Trump.\n\nColbert then used the term 'big fat bribe' to describe the settlement, two days later it was announced that his show would disappear from screens.\n\nParamount was planning a merger with media company Skydance at the time and needed the approval of Trump's Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\n\nCritics have suggested that the anti-MAGA Colbert had been axed by the network to grease the wheels of that deal, which was approved by the FCC last week. \n\nThe merger clears the way for an $8.4 billion sale of some of the most prominent names in entertainment, including CBS, Paramount Pictures, and Nickelodeon.\n\nFCC Chairman Brendan Carr said the agency's review of the proposed merger was not connected to the lawsuit.\n\nColbert gained a reputation as one of Trump’s fiercest critics, departing from the traditional late-night in favor of a more overtly partisan approach. \n\nFollowing the announcement of The Late Show's cancellation, Trump took to Truth Social to gloat over the news in a celebratory post.\n\n'I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings,' he wrote.\n\nApproval for the merger came after Skydance and its investment partner, RedBird Capital, assured the FCC of their commitment to unbiased journalism that represents diverse viewpoints. \n\nSkydance said it would appoint an ombudsman to evaluate complaints of editorial bias or other concerns about CBS in an effort to promote transparency and increased accountability.\n\nParamount also eliminated its diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives to align with the new administration's view that such affirmative action policies are discriminatory.\n\nCarr said he welcomed 'Skydance's commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.\n\n'In particular, Skydance has made written commitments to ensure that the new company's programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum.'\n\nCarr also hailed what he called a victory in 'the FCC's efforts to eliminate invidious forms of DEI discrimination.'\n\nThe FCC voted 2-1 to approve the deal, with Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez dissenting.\n\nColbert was paid between $15 million and $20 million a year for his failing show. \n\n'Insiders' immediately maintained to publications like Puck and Variety the top-rated show was canceled due to being a money pit what was losing $40million a year.\n\nThe sudden move sparked immediate backlash from left-wing celebrities and politicians, who claim the decision was strictly politically-motivated.","summary":"Organizers gathered outside of the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City on Sunday, with fewer than two dozen people appearing.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-14947819/Stephen-Colbert-protest-cancellation.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/28/17/100705963-0-image-m-55_1753720886606.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/07/18/8360393122195288315/1024x576_MP4_8360393122195288315.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-28 17:14:13","author":"Editor,Joe Hutchison","authors":["Editor","Joe Hutchison"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.068},{"id":346028878,"title":"CNN’s Harry Enten Stunned Americans Trust GOP Over Dems On Foreign Policy","text":"CNN chief data analyst Harry Enten expressed surprise on Monday about how Americans trust Republicans more than Democrats when it comes to foreign policy, despite ongoing global conflicts.\n\nA Fox News poll conducted in July found Republicans have a three-point advantage on foreign policy, while a Wall Street Journal poll found the GOP with an eight-point advantage in July, Enten said. On “CNN News Central,” Enten asserted the data was “surprising” because of foreign policy issues taking place under the Republican-controlled government. (RELATED: Charlamagne Tells Pete Buttigieg His ‘Biggest Problem With Democrats’ To His Face)\n\n“This one was a surprising one to me, given everything that’s going on in Russia, what happened in Iran, what happened in Gaza. But the bottom line is: Democrats in the American voters’ minds cannot hack it,” Enten said. “What are we talking about? Party trusted more on foreign policy. Well, the GOP holds an average six-point lead in the month of July. Look at this. Fox News came out last week, plus three points for Republicans on foreign policy over the Democrats.”\n\n“You think that number is not high enough for you? How about the Wall Street Journal? GOP plus eight points when they match congressional Democrats up against congressional Republicans,” he continued. “The bottom line is this: despite everything that’s going on in the world right now, Republicans are more trusted [than] Democrats when it comes to foreign policy and the world at large.”\n\nCNN anchor John Berman asked Enten how the numbers compare to those during the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\n“Again, this to me was a surprising number since [President] Donald Trump said he’d come in and broker all these peace deals. And while he’s brokered some, he hasn’t obviously brokered one between Ukraine and Russia,” Enten said. “And obviously the situation in Gaza. But take a look here. Trust more on foreign policy. You go back to 2024. Trump had a six-point advantage over [former Vice President] Kamala Harris. Again, look at the average right now. It hasn’t moved despite everything that‘s going on in the world. You see Republicans plus six points here.”\n\n“Despite any misgivings that the American public might have about Donald Trump, when you match up Republicans against Democrats, Donald Trump against Democrats, still, at this particular point, they are doing significantly better than you might expect,” he added. “And when it comes to the issue of foreign policy, again, what you see is in the American voters’ minds, Democrats, simply put, can’t hack it. More voters trust Republicans on foreign policy very much like they did back during the 2024 campaign.”\n\nTrump told reporters on Monday that he would drastically shorten the deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to come to a ceasefire deal with Ukraine from 50 days to “10 or 12 days” during his meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland. The president threatened to implement sweeping secondary tariffs and sanctions against crucial Russian industries if a deal was not reached.\n\nRecent polling by CNN and The Wall Street Journal also found that Democrats’ favorability ratings have plunged to 28% and 33%, respectively.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(a) relatively short time ago and it's been quite the success,\" the former real estate developer boasted to an impassive von der Leyen.\"It's an honor to have you at the new ballroom at Turnberry,\" he added.Trump acquired the storied complex on Scotland's stunning southwestern coast in 2014. Like all his properties and assets, Turnberry was transferred to a holding company now managed by his sons. The family have long hoped it will again be used to host golf's British Open, the only major men's event outside the United States. It last hosted the illustrious occasion in 2009, well before Trump took charge of it.On Monday, he had to be content with welcoming Keir Starmer to the resort, as the UK prime minister arrived to talk trade and international affairs to the wail of the bagpipes, which initially drowned out their words. Starmer said it was \"fantastic to be here, thank you for your hospitality, and to see this amazing golf course.\"I'll invite you to a football ground at some stage, we can exchange sports,\" Starmer, who is a football fan, told Trump.The US president later regaled the UK leader during a rambling press conference with tales of how he used local Scottish tradesmen to repair the ballroom's roof and huge windows.The pair were to travel to another Trump golf resort in northeast Scotland later Monday to be joined by Scottish leader John Swinney, where the US president will inaugurate a new course on Tuesday. The controversy during Trump's first term around the use of his own properties to conduct government business appears to have largely dissipated.The 79-year-old Republican leader announced in 2019 he would host an upcoming G7 summit at another of his branded golf courses in Florida, before backing down following a domestic political backlash. Six years on in Scotland, he appears very much at home in his own residences bearing his name in golden letters at the entrance -- and even on paper cups provided to visitors. Any outcry appears minimal as Trump openly holds court with European leaders between rounds of golf, seemingly bending them to his will.Swinney, who had expressed a preference for Trump's Democrat rival Kamala Harris during last year's US presidential election contest, has drawn criticism after reportedly agreeing a subsidy for a tournament to be held on the Aberdeenshire course.Meanwhile on Sunday, von der Leyen courteously listened as the American president chastised Europe for its migration policies and ranted about wind turbines, which he branded a \"con job\". \"In all fairness Germany tried it and wind doesn't work,\" he told his European counterpart, who happens to be German.Trump, who has made personal preoccupations political priorities, has long disliked wind turbines railing against them as being \"ugly\", and battling -- unsuccessfully -- to stop the installation of an offshore cluster near his Aberdeenshire golf course. Von der Leyen appeared at pains to remain diplomatic, making a point of flattering the American president. \"You're known as a tough negotiator and dealmaker,\" she said. \"But fair!\" Trump interrupted, eliciting approving laughter from his delegation. \"But fair,\" the EU chief conceded, ahead of a brief discussion which culminated in the Europeans resigning themselves to 15 percent tariffs on their exports to the US.","summary":"Ever-confident of his own prowess and deaf to claims of a conflict of interest, Donald Trump has been hosting European leaders and getting in some golf while proudly promoting his luxury Scottish resorts.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/home-home-trump-showcases-his-resorts-golf-diplomacy-3779630","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4613240/us-president-donald-trump-welcomed-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer-his-luxury-golf-resort.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=726d22db7c778a84f27ecec054c3bb25","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-28 15:00:22","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.301},{"id":345982096,"title":"‘The whole thing was a fake’: Trump says Democrats could have ‘put things in’ the Epstein file","text":"President Donald Trump on Monday baselessly suggested that any mentions of his name in criminal case files related to deceased pedophile Jeffrey Epstein would be there as a result of Democratic efforts to ensnare him in a “hoax.”\n\nSitting next to British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer during an hour-long media availability at his own Trump Turnberry golf resort in Scotland, Trump called the continuing furor over the case of Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges, “a hoax that's been built up way beyond proportion” and accused his predecessor of having tampered with the infamous case files.\n\n“Those files were run by the worst scum on Earth. They were run by Comey, they were run by Garland, they were run by Biden, and all of the people that actually ran the government, including the auto pen. Those files were run for four years by those people. If they had anything, I assume they would have released it,” he said. \n\nTrump then suggested that his adversaries could have “easily put something in the files that’s a phony” and compared the hypothetical result of such tampering to the infamous, salacious and unverified dossier on his alleged links to Russia that was compiled by ex-MI6 officer Christopher Steele during the 2016 presidential election. \n\n“Christopher Steele, as an example, wrote a book a dossier. We call it the fake news dossier. And the whole thing was a fake. The whole thing was a fake. They could put things in the file that are fake, but those files were run by bad, sick people,” he said.\n\nContinuing, the president mused aloud about why the previous Democratic administration didn’t release any damaging information in the case files about him during last year’s election, when revelations about his relationship with the infamous sex trafficker might have cut into the lead he held over his opponents, then-president Joe Biden and later then-vice president Kamala Harris. \n\nFor years, the president’s supporters have pushed for release of what they believe was a list of powerful people to whom Epstein is alleged to have trafficked young girls, as well as other information they believe would reflect negatively on members of the Democratic Party, various Hollywood celebrities, and other purported elites who they believe to be part of a sinister cabal controlling world events.\n\nDespite having maintained a close friendship with the disgraced financier for years, Trump has long winked and nodded at conspiracy theories involving the late sex offender. He indicated during his 2024 campaign that his administration would release the documents in question if he were victorious in last year’s presidential election.\n\nBut after the DOJ and FBI issued a memo stating that there was no such client list and announcing that no additional files relating to the case would be made public, many of Trump’s most fervent boosters have cried foul, leading to a rare split between the president and a significant segment of political base. \n\nTrump is said to be “exasperated” by the scandal and is growing “increasingly frustrated” with how his administration has handled the Epstein files saga and media attention on the president’s ties to the sex offender.\n\nDuring a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday, Trump groused about the way the burgeoning scandal has gained traction with Democrats in Congress, some of whom have joined with members of his own party to push for the Justice Department to release more information from the case files. \n\n“All they know how to do is talk and think about conspiracy theories and nonsense,” he said. “If they'd waste their time talking about America being great again, it would be so much nicer.”","summary":"Extended rant came at tail end of marathon press conference alongside Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-epstein-files-democrats-tampering-b2797412.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/28/14/80ab95d8f4b5bebf403fbe714e2c46d5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzUzNzkzMDUz-2.81125715.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/2vAi43zv-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-28 14:57:52","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.307},{"id":346022616,"title":"Al Sharpton hits back at Trump accusation about paid endorsement of Kamala Harris","text":"Rev.

And as the FEC filings say, they helped – the campaign gave funds for get-out-the-vote campaigns for National Action Network, of which I’m a part of, and other civil rights groups, some of which got more than National Action Network did.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN REPORTEDLY SPENT 6 FIGURES ON ‘CALL HER DADDY’ PODCAST WITH FEWER THAN 1 MILLION YOUTUBE VIEWS Sharpton went on to argue that Trump had \"serious problems\" related to Jeffrey Epstein and the Trump administration's announcement that there was no client list. \"So last week he was trying to flood the zone to take any pressure off of him and try to put his MAGA base back together again. The fact is, he started by saying he’s going to fire the Fed chief. That didn’t work. Then he went on to something about tariffs that didn’t work. Then he decided to do what he started his political career on start race baiting, which was he started with birtherism, that Obama wasn’t born here,\" Sharpton said. The liberal MSNBC host argued that Trump also directed an attack at former President Obama, who Trump said was the \"ringleader\" of Russiagate, in an effort to \"get past Epstein.\" \"Then over the weekend, Kamala Harris, Oprah Winfrey, Beyoncé, Al Sharpton, the race card, or the thread here is race and that’s what he’s trying to do. They’re swapping money. They’re doing things like Obama was holding back with Russia. It’s all about trying to get past Epstein,\" Sharpton argued. \"We have shown in National Action Network and other groups, what we did and didn’t do in the campaign. Even when I spoke at the convention, I said, we don’t endorse candidates. We have come with our files. Release the Epstein files, Mr. Trump. Do what we did or be quiet,\" he continued.

These ridiculous fees were incorrectly stated in the books and records. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PAY FOR AN ENDORSEMENT. IT IS TOTALLY ILLEGAL TO DO SO,\" Trump posted on Saturday. FEC filings show the Harris campaign made two $500,000 payments to Oprah Winfrey’s production company, which was first reported by the Washington Examiner after the election, on Oct. 15, a month after Winfrey appeared with Harris at a town hall event and weeks before Oprah was on stage with Harris at a Philadelphia rally before election day.

Following Harris’ loss to Trump, FEC filings revealed the Harris campaign gave two $250,000 donations to Sharpton’s nonprofit organization in September and October. Sharpton did not inform viewers of the contributions or the conflict of interest before or after the interview. Sharpton's interview with Harris fell on the former vice president's 60th birthday, as the MSNBC host asked, \"What do you want, 50 years from now, history to say about Kamala Harris?\" \"I hope that, and I really do hope that... my life will have proven to have been a life that is about fighting for the people. Fighting for the dignity of people,\" Harris said. \"Some little girl or little boy is gonna be talking about you like you talked about Ms. Shirley Chisholm,\" Sharpton commented, comparing Harris to the first Black woman elected to Congress who also made a presidential run in 1972.

Two years later, authorities arrested Epstein for the first time and charged him with felony solicitation of prostitution.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal (WSJ) alleged in a July 17 story that Trump wrote a suggestive letter to Epstein in honor of his 50th birthday in 2003, which included a drawing of a “naked woman.” The president, who has denied the accusation, sued The WSJ, Rupert Murdoch, Dow Jones & Company Inc., News Corporation and the two WSJ reporters who authored the piece over the allegation.\n\nOn the night of Epstein’s death, correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas did not perform the required 12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. counts and completed a form falsely saying that they did.

Dave Min was chatting with reporters at the US Capitol when the California Democrat was asked about whether he wants Kamala Harris to run for governor.\n\nSuddenly, Min no longer had time to talk.\n\n“I have no comment,” he said.\n\nAsked what he thought a Harris run would mean for his own reelection prospects, Min repeated, “I have no comment on that, sorry,” and bolted onto the House floor, away from reporters.\n\nRep. George Whitesides, another Democratic freshman from California who beat an incumbent Republican by 8,000 votes, took a long pause before answering whether he wanted to see the former vice president run.\n\n“I welcome her to the race. I’m just really focused on my own race, but if that’s what she feels calls to do, that’s her prerogative,” Whitesides told CNN.\n\nAs Harris deliberates on whether she should run for governor or hold out for another potential presidential bid, California Democrats are quietly asking themselves the same question. Her critics say that while she would be a favorite to win the governor’s race in a deep-blue state, possible ambivalence about her candidacy could hurt Democratic chances in swing districts as the party tries to retake the US House.\n\nSome top donors and interest group leaders insist that Harris will have to answer for former President Joe Biden, whose decision to run for reelection before making way for her remains a sore subject for Democrats, and whether Harris could have done more to prevent President Donald Trump’s return to the White House.\n\nHarris has plenty of allies who want to see her run. Several leading elected officials in the state told CNN that they do not believe the candidates already running have either the stature or experience to stand up to Trump’s pressure campaign against California on everything from immigration raids to funding cuts.\n\n“As someone who served as district attorney, attorney general and senator from California, she would have the experience, leadership and understanding of the state legislature to tackle two of the biggest problems in the state: the lack of affordable housing and a sense of a lack of public safety,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents the Silicon Valley area and has had an uneasy relationship with Harris at times.\n\nRep. Mike Levin, who held his San Diego County district by 17,000 votes last year, said he believed a Harris run could help in 2026.\n\n“She knows the state well, she knows the electorate well and I think she’d be a very formidable candidate,” he said.\n\nThe Harris critics — few of whom will put their names to their complaints — are doing their own math: She would probably win if she runs, they say, but if she doesn’t generate enthusiasm or if she fires up Republicans, she could prove a drag on vulnerable Democrats like Min and Whitesides as well as State Assembly and State Senate districts where Democrats don’t have votes to spare.\n\n“There’s no groundswell for her candidacy. In fact, I think it would only fire up Republicans and hurt our ability to win the four to five seats that we need to win to win the House and hold on to three seats that we just flipped in 2024,” said one California House Democrat who asked not to be named in order to speak candidly about a candidate widely expected to be the party’s front-runner if she enters the race. “She comes in with baggage.”\n\nPart of the issue for many Californians, said Rep. Jimmy Gomez, who represents a reliably Democratic district in Los Angeles, is that no matter what kind of campaign Harris might run, people believe that being governor wasn’t her first choice.\n\n“Once you’re the vice president of the United States, there’s only one place to go. It’s president,” Gomez told CNN. “For me, if I was vice president and all of a sudden I lose, it would be a fallback to me. I hate to put it so bluntly.”\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has had a tough relationship with her fellow San Francisco-rooted politician. Asked by CNN whether she wanted to see Harris run for governor as she left the Capitol last week, Pelosi said only, “I want her to do whatever she wants to do.”\n\nWhere Harris stands\n\nHarris is once again earning her reputation for long, drawn-out deliberation.\n\nSeveral people who have spoken to Harris told CNN she has asked them whether they think she should run. Some of those people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose private conversations, say they have turned the question back to her.\n\nShe has also reached out to former California governors to ask what she could get done on the job, though not all have agreed to speak with her about it.\n\nHarris canceled a long-planned August vacation, a move that one person familiar with her deliberations does not mean she’s decided what to do. Besides talking about a potential governor’s race, that person said, Harris has in the last few weeks asked her closest aides for research and memos that outline other options.\n\nAmong those options: Starting a 501(c)(4) organization focused on the information ecosystem and how to empower younger voters while rethinking institutions key to democracy, creating a political action committee to raise money for other candidates, and doing a listening tour of Southern states with a 2028 presidential bid in mind. Her thinking, the person said, is that she would have time for all of these if she doesn’t run for governor.\n\nWhile nursing some worries that Harris has let the governor’s race take shape too much in her absence, confidants have also kept tabs on the other candidates, who include former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, former US Rep. Katie Porter and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Harris allies privately scoff at the insistence of several candidates that they’d remain in the race if she enters it or that they would retain much support if they did.\n\nAnd few voters are focused on a governor’s race when the primary isn’t until next June. The top two finishers in that contest, regardless of party, will advance to the November 2026 ballot.\n\nSupporters and rivals are not waiting for the fall book tour for Harris’ soon-to-be-published memoir or a decision on the race to choreograph around her. Several pro-Harris Democrats have been passing around numbers from private polls conducted for others in the state showing her popularity among Democrats is much higher than any declared candidate. Supporters of others have been seeding chatter that people don’t want her back on the ballot, often with data that shows a drop-off of support for Democrats across California races when she was the presidential nominee last year.\n\nBurning over Trump’s time in office, Harris is eager to stay involved, several who have spoken with the former vice president told CNN. She wants to at least keep open the option for another White House campaign in the future.\n\nThat’s different, though, from delving back to the hand-to-hand politics that advisers feel this kind of run for governor would require, if only for Harris to stave off looking like she was taking the race for granted, and for grappling with big challenges in Sacramento that are getting bigger.\n\nHarris’ decision is not just intertwined with closing the door on a 2028 presidential run, but weighed against the quieter, wealthier existence that key members of her family have suggested to others they’d prefer.\n\nRep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, a California Democrat, said that especially among fellow Black women she speaks with, “they’re still healing and they want to make sure that she is fully healed.”\n\n“She should certainly run if that’s the thing that she wants to do. She is certainly California’s girl. We have been rooting for her for so long,” Kamlager-Dove said, adding that though she thinks having yet another big personality as governor is important, “those decisions are incredibly personal.”\n\nThe wildcard: redistricting\n\nOne factor in how vulnerable California Democrats feel about a Harris run wasn’t in the conversation just a few months ago: the prospect that their districts may be redrawn in the middle of the decade.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session to consider a rare mid-decade redistricting at the behest of Trump and the Justice Department. Trump says he wants to eliminate as many as five Democratic seats in Texas ahead of the midterms. That’s led leaders of Democratic-run states — including California Gov. Gavin Newsom — to threaten their own redrawing of lines to push out Republicans.\n\nIn California, Democrats who won by small margins could face harder races as they lose friendly territory to other districts.\n\nCalifornia Democrats who argued Harris’ weaknesses to CNN could not, when pressed, say any of the other candidates would be more of more help for down-ticket candidates. And Harris supporters point out that if the argument holds, any statewide dynamics are likely to be subsumed to nationalized energy in a midterm year when Democrats will be mobilizing to take the majority in the House as a check on Trump.\n\nRep. Mark Takano, who represents the Southern California city of Riverside, told CNN that not only does he hope Harris considers running, but that enthusiasm for her and for Democrats overall has resurged in the last few months in response to Trump.\n\n“After the Los Angeles protests, the ‘No Kings’ march, any drift to the right among certain parts — Latinos, African Americans, Asians — I think that’s been staunched, to say the least, and it’s moved the other direction,” Takano said.\n\nBut Rep. Young Kim, a Republican who represents an Orange County seat that is once again near the top of Democrats’ wish list to flip, laughed when asked about Harris running.\n\n“Seriously, good luck to her,” Kim said with a laugh. She clarified she was being sarcastic.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All rights reserved.","summary":"(CNN) &#8212; Rep.

Trump won North Carolina by about 3 percentage points, one of his closest margins of victory.Trump endorsed Whatley on his Truth Social platform Thursday night, posting that should he run, “Mike would make an unbelievable Senator from North Carolina.”Ex-U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel already has been campaigning for the Democratic nomination for months. Party primaries would be March 3.Cooper, 68, has been on statewide ballots going back a quarter-century — serving 16 years previously as attorney general before being first elected governor in 2016.With a political career going back nearly 40 years, Cooper has had a knack for winning in a state where the legislature and appeals courts are now dominated by Republicans. State law barred Cooper from seeking a third consecutive gubernatorial term. He spent the spring on a teaching gig at Harvard.State and national Democrats were longing for Cooper to join the race well before Tillis announced June 29 that he would not seek a third term. That news came after Trump threatened to back a primary candidate against him as Tillis opposed Medicaid reductions in the president’s tax break and spending cut package,RELATED STORY | What's in Trump's 'big, beautiful bill'Democrats haven't won a Senate race since 2008 in North Carolina, where independent voters tend to vote Republican in federal elections. Statewide races can be financially exorbitant because there are so many television markets — hundreds of millions of dollars are expected to be spent in the race.Cooper's recent political history has painted him as a fighter against what he's considered extreme Republican policies, while at times finding consensus with GOP rivals.When asked by The Associated Press last December about a Senate bid, Cooper replied: “If you’re going to run for public office again, you must have your heart and soul in it, you must have the fire in the belly.\"As governor he steered the state through the coronavirus pandemic, Hurricanes Helene and Florence and a law that became an early flashpoint in the culture wars over access to public restrooms by transgender people. That “bathroom bill” was rolled back early in Cooper's first term, and the state’s economy soared during Cooper’s tenure, marked by big jobs announcements and low unemployment.While Cooper also managed to get Medicaid expansion approved and a landmark greenhouse gases law enacted, he fell short in stopping legislation that widely expanded private school vouchers and narrowed abortion rights.Cooper’s perceived accomplishments raised his national profile in 2024, making him as a potential running mate for Kamala Harris until he said it “just wasn’t the right time” for him and for North Carolina.Republicans have argued that Cooper remains susceptible politically, citing what they consider an extreme record supporting abortion rights and opposing school choice that led to many vetoes.They've also cited a gubernatorial administration marked by spending overruns at the state Department of Transportation; its response to Helene and delays in rebuilding or renovating homes after Hurricanes Matthew and Florence; and executive orders that restricted businesses and school instruction during COVID-19. As for the roaring economy, Republicans credit themselves through lower taxes and deregulation.Tillis’ retirement announcement heartened far-right Republicans and strong Trump supporters who have been unhappy for years with his willingness to challenge Trump’s actions and his Cabinet agency choices.Republicans had deferred to the president’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump, who is a North Carolina native, North Carolina State University graduate and a popular former RNC co-chair with Whatley during the 2024 election campaign. She posted on the social media platform X on Thursday that she would not seek the Senate seat.","summary":"Former Democratic North Carolina Gov.

This is his latest bid for office in a lengthy political career.Cooper, 68, is now the most prominent candidate in the race that is drawing national attention and is expected to break spending records with Democrats rallying around his campaign.Cooper served an unprecedented four terms as state attorney general over 16 years before he unseated then-incumbent Gov. Pat McCrory (R) to be elected governor in 2016. He won that election and reelection in 2020, by a larger margin, despite President Trump carrying the state in the presidential election in both years.ALSO READ: Julian Brown missing: Atlanta inventor posts disturbing social media post before his 'disappearance'.

Mike Collins announced his long-expected entrance into Georgia’s contested Republican Senate primary Monday morning.\n\nCollins, a two-term lawmaker who has cultivated a reputation as a legislative workhorse, is running to unseat incumbent Democratic Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff during the midterms. Collins is likely to tout his ties to the MAGA movement and his successful push to pass the Laken Riley Act, illegal immigration crackdown legislation President Donald Trump signed into law in January, as he vies for the Republican nomination. (RELATED: Vulnerable Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff Agrees With Angry Woman At Town Hall Who Thinks Trump Should Be Impeached)\n\n“We need a senator who works for Georgia, not the California crazies or New York nutjobs,” Collins said in his campaign announcement video. “I don’t know who Jon Ossoff really works for but it sure as hell isn’t Georgia.”\n\n I’m in. pic.twitter.com/Bxhm4e8jp2 — Mike Collins (@MikeCollinsGA) July 28, 2025 \n\nCollins’ entry into the primary contest comes as Trump and the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), Senate Republicans’ campaign arm, have yet to back a candidate. Georgia is seen as a prime pickup opportunity for Republicans during the midterms given the state’s Republican leanings and Trump defeating former Vice President Kamala Harris in the state last November.\n\nRepublican Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, who was previously viewed as the party’s top recruit for the race, will back former football coach Derek Dooley, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Dooley is a political newcomer who has never held elected office. He is expected to jump in the race in the coming weeks.\n\nKemp reportedly told Collins and the other GOP contenders already in the race that he would be endorsing Dooley, leading Georgia Insurance Commissioner John King to suspend his campaign Thursday. King said there was “little path forward to the nomination” in a post on the social media platform X.\n\nCollins is also expected to emphasize his blue collar background and his career in the trucking industry during the primary contest.\n\n“In trucking, you got to deliver,” Collins also says in the campaign announcement video. “It’s time to send a trucker to the U.S. Senate to steamroll the radical left, deliver on President Trump’s America First agenda and put the people of Georgia back in the driver’s seat.”\n\nRepublican Georgia Rep. Buddy Carter, who is partly self-funding his campaign, is the only other well-known candidate in the race thus far.\n\nOssoff is expected to raise a formidable amount of cash over the coming year to prevent Republicans from flipping the seat. The Georgia Democrat has roughly $15.5 million in the bank, according to a recent Federal Election Commission filing.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Most of America’s biggest late-night hosts have become nothing more than hyper-partisan activist hacks for the Democrats – a party that’s rarely been more unpopular. No wonder Colbert got canned. More will follow.”\n\nThe 60-year-old doubled down on his stance by agreeing with comments by the US late-night TV legend Jay Leno, who disagreed with the political nature of many modern talk shows. \n\nLeno reportedly said in an interview with the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute: “I love political humour, don’t get me wrong. But it’s just what happens when people wind up cosying too much to one side or the other. Why shoot for just half an audience all the time? You know, why not try to get the whole? I mean, I like to bring people into the big picture.”\n\nMorgan later criticised John Oliver after he watched a 60 Minutes interview with the Last Week Tonight presenter. “Just watched a drooling @60Minutes segment tonight about John Oliver, who was proud of telling his viewers not to vote for Trump at the last election,” Morgan wrote. “He told them to vote for Kamala Harris instead. That’s not comedy, it’s partisan political activism.”\n\nColbert’s The Late Show was axed earlier this month in what CBS described as a “financial decision”.\n\nBut many of Colbert’s fans and supporters, including high-profile names including David Letterman and Elizabeth Warren, questioned the timing of the decision. The announcement came shortly after Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, agreed to pay Donald Trump $16m to settle the president’s lawsuit against the company over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, which the network’s lawyers deemed “meritless” in recent court filings.\n\nTrump has gloated over The Late Show’s cancellation on social media, writing: “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next.”","summary":"Morgan said it was ‘no wonder Colbert got canned’ from ‘The Late Show’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/piers-morgan-stephen-colbert-last-show-b2797307.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/28/11/49/pmsc.png?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/S2C4X4R2-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-28 13:20:23","author":"Greg Evans","authors":["Greg Evans"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.178},{"id":345978816,"title":"Longtime Washington Post fact checker takes buyout, says paper has yet to find replacement before exit","text":"The man behind The Washington Post's \"Pinocchios\" is leaving the paper without anyone to fill his shoes. Glenn Kessler, the editor of The Fact Checker, announced Monday he has taken a buyout, ending his lengthy career at the Post. \"After more than 27 years at The Washington Post, including almost 15 as The Fact Checker, I will be leaving on July 31, having taken a buyout,\" Kessler wrote on his Facebook page. \"Much as I would have liked to keep scrutinizing politicians in Washington, especially in this era, the financial considerations were impossible to dismiss.\" ANOTHER HIGH PROFILE CONTRIBUTOR REPORTEDLY LEAVES THE WASHINGTON POST AMID FALLOUT FROM EDITORIAL CHANGES Kessler said he wrote or edited more than 3,000 fact checks as editor and chief writer of The Fact Checker. \"When I started in 2011, there were only a handful of fact-checking organizations around the world, and I have been thrilled to watch the movement expand across the globe. So many of these brave and diligent fact checkers have become good friends,\" Kessler wrote. \"My fact checks were routinely the most-read articles on The Post’s website. I had my detractors, from both the left and right, but many readers appreciated my efforts to sort out the truth in political rhetoric,\" he added. WASHINGTON POST CEO URGES STAFFERS WHO DON’T 'FEEL ALIGNED' WITH PAPER'S NEW DIRECTION TO TAKE BUYOUT Kessler revealed he attempted to stay on a contract basis long enough for his bosses to find a successor for a smooth transition, to no avail. \"I didn’t want The Post to have a gap in fact-checking coverage during this fraught period in U.S. history. But we couldn’t work out an agreement,\" he wrote. Washington Post executive editor Matt Murray appeared onboard with hiring a new fact checker in an exchange with Kessler, according to a source familiar with the matter. Kessler's next chapter will involve him writing books, and he's open to freelance and consulting work. \"In 2018, when the Fact Checker team was compiling a database of more than 30,000 Trump claims, I told the New York Times that 'I have the best job in journalism,'\" Kessler wrote. \"I still believe that, and I’m sorry to leave without a replacement lined up. But it’s the right time for me. I hope The Post finds someone to carry on this important project.\" The Washington Post did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. Murray implemented a new round of the paper's Voluntary Separation Program (VSP) in May, hoping that most veteran staffers would be enticed by the exit offer. The program is set to end this week. WASHINGTON POST OBITUARY SECTION ON LIFE SUPPORT AS WRITERS TAKE BUYOUTS: REPORT According to a VSP document previously viewed by Fox News Digital, nine months of base pay would be given to staffers employed for 10-15 years, 12 months of base pay for 15-20-year veterans, 15 months of base pay for 20-25-year veterans and 18 months for anyone who has worked at the Post for more than 25 years. All of them would also receive 12 months of pay credit in their Separate Retirement Account (SRA). Other high-profile writers who've taken the buyouts include columnists Jonathan Capehart, Catherine Rampell, Philip Bump and Joe Davidson. Also fueling the exodus from the editorial pages was the initiative by the Post's billionaire owner Jeff Bezos to promote \"personal liberties and free markets\" and vowing not to publish pieces opposing those principles. Bezos' directive, which was announced in February, led to the immediate resignation of Post opinion editor David Shipley. Others resigned in protest and a mass cancellation of subscriptions by liberal leaders rocked the paper. The paper faced similar backlash last fall when Bezos blocked the paper's endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris shortly before the election. Earlier this month, Washington Post CEO Will Lewis sent a memo to staff issuing an ultimatum for those contemplating adapting to the paper's new direction. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The moment demands that we continue to rethink all aspects of our organization and business to maximize our impact,\" Lewis wrote in the memo obtained by Fox News Digital. \"If we want to reconnect with our audience and continue to defend democracy, more changes at The Post will be necessary. And to succeed, we need to be united as a team with a strong belief and passion in where we are heading.\" \"I understand and respect, however, that our chosen path is not for everyone,\" Lewis continued. \"That’s exactly why we introduced the voluntary separation program. As we continue in this new direction, I want to ask those who do not feel aligned with the company’s plan to reflect on that. The VSP is designed to support you in making this decision, give you the ability to weigh your options thoughtfully and with less concern about financial consequences. And if you think that it’s time to move on to a new chapter, the VSP helps you take that next step with more security.\"","summary":"The Washington Post&apos;s longtime fact-checker Glenn Kessler is leaving the paper after 27 years, the latest to take a buyout at the embattled newspaper.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-post-fact-checker-takes-buyout-says-paper-has-yet-find-replacement-before-exit","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/04/931/523/Glenn-kessler-washington-post-CC.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-28 13:13:09","author":"Joseph Wulfsohn","authors":["Joseph Wulfsohn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.178},{"id":345955228,"title":"Rep.

I'm fighting for the working class, and that means not being controlled by any special interests.\"The endorsement comes after the pair appealed to young voters in separate appearances last week at the Voters of Tomorrow Summit in Washington, along with former Vice President Kamala Harris and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi. Khanna, who co-chaired Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, addressed the generational divide within the party, telling the audience that the \"old guard\" needs to go. \"I'm here to say that a new Democratic Party, a reborn Democratic Party, a populist Democratic Party, a multiracial Democratic Party, a Democratic Party that centers the working and middle class, a Democratic Party that looks like the future, is a Democratic Party that can lead us back to victory and lead us to a better America,\" Khanna said. Abughazaleh, a former journalist and community advocate, has quickly amassed a war chest. Her campaign recently announced she has raised more than $1 million through grassroots support since her entry to the race in March. Evanston Mayor Daniel Bliss, who announced his bid for the seat in May, has raised more than $700,000 and picked up the endorsement of key progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.. At least half a dozen candidates are vying for the congressional seat ahead of the March 2026 primary. Abughazaleh hopes to differentiate herself with a bold, policy-first platform aimed at lowering housing and healthcare costs and advancing the Green New Deal. \"My grandfather immigrated to the Chicago area in 1957, and my parents got engaged right here in 1987,\" Abughazaleh said. \"Three generations later, I'm here, and I am committed to fighting to preserve the values that brought my grandfather here in the first place.\"","summary":"Rep.

Roy Cooper launches Senate bid for GOP-held seat","text":"Former two-term Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper is running for the Senate in battleground North Carolina. Cooper announced his candidacy on Monday morning in the open-seat race to succeed Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, who announced late last month that he wouldn’t run for re-election in the 2026 midterm elections. \"I have thought on it and prayed about it, and I have decided: I am running to be the next U.S. Senator from North Carolina,\" Cooper said in a social media post. Cooper's campaign launch is seen as a major coup for the Democratic Party, as he was the party's top recruit in next year's elections, bolstering their chances of flipping a key GOP-held seat as they try to take a big bite out of the Republicans' 53-47 Senate majority. DNC CHAIR TELLS FOX NEWS DIGITAL DEMOCRATS HAVE HIT ‘ROCK BOTTOM’ - HERE'S HIS PLAN TO REBOUND His announcement was expected, as numerous news organizations, including Fox News, recently reported that the former governor would launch a campaign in the coming days. And this past weekend, at the North Carolina Democrats \"Unity Dinner,\" Cooper teased his run during his speech. He grabbed cheers when he asked people to stand up if they were running for office in 2026 and said, \"Hey, I'm not sitting down, am I.\" Ahead of his launch, the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), which is the Senate GOP's campaign arm, targeted Cooper in a digital ad. \"Roy Cooper is a Democrat lapdog who spent his time as Governor sabotaging President Trump, doing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' bidding, releasing violent illegal aliens into North Carolina streets, and championing radical transgender ideology,\" National Republican Senatorial Commitee communications director Joanna Rodriguez charged in a statement Monday morning. While Cooper isn't the only Democrat to announce their candidacy – former one-term Rep. Wiley Nickel launched a campaign in April – he will instantly be considered the clear front-runner for the party's nomination in North Carolina. FIRST ON FOX: REPUBLICAN LAUNCHES SECOND STRAIGHT BID TO FLIP DEMOCRAT HELD SWING STATE SENATE SEAT Cooper, who was a popular governor during his eight years steering North Carolina, was floated last year as a possible running mate for then-Vice President Kamala Harris after she succeeded then-President Joe Biden as the Democrats' 2024 presidential nominee. Cooper is likely to face off in next year's general election with Republican National Committee (RNC) chair Michael Whatley, in what would be one of the most competitive, bruising, and expensive Senate battles of 2026. President Donald Trump, who is the ultimate kingmaker in GOP politics and whose endorsements in Republican primaries are extremely powerful, on Thursday gave Whatley his \"Complete and Total Endorsement.\" \"Mike would make an unbelievable Senator from North Carolina. He is fantastic at everything he does, and he was certainly great at the RNC,\" Trump added, in a social media post. And NRSC chair Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina called Whatley \"a strong America First conservative who will be a champion for North Carolina in the U.S. Senate. RNC CHAIR WHATLEY TO SEEK OPEN GOP-HELD SENATE SEAT IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE Scott noted that \"the Tar Heel State has supported President Trump in all three of his elections and elected Republicans to both its U.S. Senate seats for over a decade. With Michael as our candidate, we will win it again in 2026!\" Trump called Tillis' announcement last month that he wouldn't seek a third six-year term in the Senate \"great news.\" Tillis is a GOP critic of the president, and Trump torched the senator last month for not supporting his so-called \"big, beautiful\" spending and tax cut bill. Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law and a North Carolina native who served last year alongside Whatley as an RNC co-chair, was considered to be Trump's top choice to run for Tillis' seat. But in a statement on Thursday, Lara Trump said \"after much consideration and heartfelt discussions with my family, friends, and supporters, I have decided not to pursue the United States Senate seat in North Carolina at this time.\" Whatley, who served as chair of the North Carolina GOP before being elected last year as RNC chair, said recently in a Fox News Digital interview that the Senate showdown in the Tar Heel State is \"going to be one of the marquee races in the country.\"","summary":"Roy Cooper enters North Carolina Senate race as Democrats&apos; top recruit, boosting chances to flip a key Republican seat in 2026 against likely GOP candidate Michael Whatley.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/game-north-carolina-former-democratic-gov-roy-cooper-launches-senate-bid-gop-held-seat","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/04/931/523/roy-cooper-philadelphia-sep.-10-2024.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-28 12:22:26","author":"Paul Steinhauser","authors":["Paul Steinhauser"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.169},{"id":345957032,"title":"Former Democratic North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper will run for Senate in 2026 - AP News","text":"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper will run for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina, giving Democrats a proven statewide winner in an open-seat race that is expected to be one of the most competitive 2026 contests. \n\nCooper made the announcement Monday with a video released on social media and his campaign website. The former two-term governor will immediately become the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in the race to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Thom Tillis. \n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley plans to run for the GOP nomination, with President Donald Trump’s blessing, according to two people familiar with his thinking who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly before an official announcement. \n\nWhatley, the former North Carolina GOP chairman, received Trump’s endorsement after the president’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, passed on the seat. \n\nCooper’s candidacy is a big recruiting win for Democrats, who see the open seat as a top pick-up opportunity in what will be a challenging year. To retake the majority in 2026, Democrats need to net four seats, and most of the contests are in states that Trump easily won last year. Trump won North Carolina by about 3 percentage points, one of his closest margins of victory.\n\nTrump endorsed Whatley on his Truth Social platform Thursday night, posting that should he run, “Mike would make an unbelievable Senator from North Carolina.”\n\nEx-U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel already has been campaigning for the Democratic nomination for months. Party primaries would be March 3. \n\nCooper, 68, has been on statewide ballots going back a quarter-century — serving 16 years previously as attorney general before being first elected governor in 2016. \n\nWith a political career going back nearly 40 years, Cooper has had a knack for winning in a state where the legislature and appeals courts are now dominated by Republicans. State law barred Cooper from seeking a third consecutive gubernatorial term. He spent the spring on a teaching gig at Harvard.\n\nState and national Democrats were longing for Cooper to join the race well before Tillis announced June 29 that he would not seek a third term. That news came after Trump threatened to back a primary candidate against him as Tillis opposed Medicaid reductions in the president’s tax break and spending cut package, \n\nDemocrats haven’t won a Senate race since 2008 in North Carolina, where independent voters tend to vote Republican in federal elections. Statewide races can be financially exorbitant because there are so many television markets — hundreds of millions of dollars are expected to be spent in the race.\n\nCooper’s recent political history has painted him as a fighter against what he’s considered extreme Republican policies, while at times finding consensus with GOP rivals. \n\nWhen asked by The Associated Press last December about a Senate bid, Cooper replied: “If you’re going to run for public office again, you must have your heart and soul in it, you must have the fire in the belly.”\n\nAs governor he steered the state through the coronavirus pandemic, Hurricanes Helene and Florence and a law that became an early flashpoint in the culture wars over access to public restrooms by transgender people. That “bathroom bill” was rolled back early in Cooper’s first term, and the state’s economy soared during Cooper’s tenure, marked by big jobs announcements and low unemployment. \n\nWhile Cooper also managed to get Medicaid expansion approved and a landmark greenhouse gases law enacted, he fell short in stopping legislation that widely expanded private school vouchers and narrowed abortion rights. \n\nCooper’s perceived accomplishments raised his national profile in 2024, making him as a potential running mate for Kamala Harris until he said it “just wasn’t the right time” for him and for North Carolina. \n\nRepublicans have argued that Cooper remains susceptible politically, citing what they consider an extreme record supporting abortion rights and opposing school choice that led to many vetoes. \n\nThey’ve also cited a gubernatorial administration marked by spending overruns at the state Department of Transportation; its response to Helene and delays in rebuilding or renovating homes after Hurricanes Matthew and Florence; and executive orders that restricted businesses and school instruction during COVID-19. As for the roaring economy, Republicans credit themselves through lower taxes and deregulation.\n\nTillis’ retirement announcement heartened far-right Republicans and strong Trump supporters who have been unhappy for years with his willingness to challenge Trump’s actions and his Cabinet agency choices. \n\nRepublicans had deferred to the president’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump, who is a North Carolina native, North Carolina State University graduate and a popular former RNC co-chair with Whatley during the 2024 election campaign. She posted on the social media platform X on Thursday that she would not seek the Senate seat.","summary":"Former Democratic North Carolina Gov.

He focused on expanding Medicaid, boosting education funding, and blocking GOP-led legislation, often clashing with the Republican legislature. Despite the state’s conservative tilt, Cooper remained popular and won reelection in 2020 even as Trump carried North Carolina.\n\nThe race is expected to pit Cooper against Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who has secured President Donald Trump’s “complete and total endorsement.” Whatley is preparing his own campaign and is widely viewed as the GOP front-runner following the president’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump’s decision not to run.\n\nNational Democrats praised Cooper’s entry, calling him one of the party’s strongest recruits of the cycle. Republicans, however, were quick to criticize Cooper. \n\n“Roy Cooper is a Democrat lapdog who spent his time as Governor sabotaging President Trump, doing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’ bidding, releasing violent illegal aliens into North Carolina streets, and championing radical transgender ideology,” said National Republican Senatorial Committee Communications Director Joanna Rodriguez.\n\nCooper is expected to face a primary challenge from former Rep. Wiley Nickel, but Democratic operatives anticipate the party will quickly consolidate around the former governor.\n\nThe contest is expected to be one of the most expensive and closely watched of 2026, with control of the Senate possibly hinging on the outcome. Democrats see Cooper’s candidacy as a chance to break Republicans’ recent winning streak in North Carolina Senate races, in which the GOP has prevailed in seven of the last eight contests.\n\nFirst elected in 2014, Tillis delivered a fiery floor speech last month denouncing Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, warning that its deep Medicaid cuts would “betray the promise Donald Trump made” to voters. He was one of just two Republicans to vote against the bill, a defiant stand that drew an immediate backlash from Trump, who threatened to back a primary opponent. Less than 24 hours later, Tillis announced he would not run for reelection.\n\nNorth Carolina has consistently ranked among the nation’s most competitive states. In 2024, Trump won it by just over 3 points, continuing a streak of razor-thin margins. The Senate races have been no different: Tillis edged out Democrat Cal Cunningham by fewer than 2 points in 2020, while Ted Budd defeated Cheri Beasley by about 3 points in 2022.\n\nWith unaffiliated voters surpassing Democrats and Republicans in registration, the state remains one of the most politically balanced and pivotal battlegrounds.","summary":"Former North Carolina Gov.

He is alleging that Kamala Harris spent campaign money on celebrity endorsements – even if a previous investigation has found this claim to be false. In a recent post on Truth Social, Trump has demanded that Beyoncé (and other celebrities) be prosecuted for campaigning for Harris during the 2024 presidential election. Apparently still bruised from his lack of A-list talent support during the election, Trump wrote: “I’m looking at the large amount of money owed by the Democrats, after the Presidential Election, and the fact that they admit to paying, probably illegally, Eleven Million Dollars to singer Beyoncé for an ENDORSEMENT (she never sang, not one note, and left the stage to a booing and angry audience!), Three Million Dollars for “expenses,” to Oprah, Six Hundred Thousand Dollars to very low rated TV ‘anchor,’ Al Sharpton (a total lightweight!), and others to be named for doing, absolutely NOTHING!” He continued: “These ridiculous fees were incorrectly stated in the books and records. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PAY FOR AN ENDORSEMENT. IT IS TOTALLY ILLEGAL TO DO SO. Can you imagine what would happen if politicians started paying for people to endorse them. All hell would break out! Kamala, and all of those that received Endorsement money, BROKE THE LAW. They should all be prosecuted! Thank you for your attention to this matter.” Regarding Trump’s claim, it is true that Harris’ team spent funds on rallies and events, which featured celebrity endorsers like Beyoncé, Oprah and Lady Gaga. However, the publicly shared financial records from the 2024 presidential campaign show that those expenses went toward production costs and staff, not to the celebrities themselves. This was subsequently confirmed by a New York Times investigation published in November 2024. Beyoncé publicly supported Harris last year and made a speech a rally on reproductive rights. She previously threatened Trump’s campaign team with legal action for its unauthorized use of ‘Freedom’ in a social media video, days after the singer approved the song as the official anthem for Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign. At the time, Trump spoke dismissively about Beyoncé’s appearance at a Harris rally in Houston, saying: \"Beyoncé would come in. Everyone’s expecting a couple of songs. There were no songs. There was no happiness.”This year, Trump also called for a “major investigation” into Bruce Springsteen after the music legend made several remarks criticising Trump at his Manchester show earlier this year. Trump alleged that Springsteen was paid by Kamala Harris for his “POOR PERFORMANCE DURING HER CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT” (posted online on Truth Social in all caps, naturally). He went on to ask: “ISN’T THAT A MAJOR AND ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION?” In addition to Springsteen, Trump also took aim at other artists, including Bono and (once again) Beyoncé, during his rant: “HOW MUCH DID KAMALA HARRIS PAY BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN FOR HIS POOR PERFORMANCE DURING HER CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT?. WHY DID HE ACCEPT THAT MONEY IF HE IS SUCH A FAN OF HERS? ISN’T THAT A MAJOR AND ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION? WHAT ABOUT BEYONCÉ? …AND HOW MUCH WENT TO OPRAH, AND BONO??? He carried on, escalating things: “I am going to call for a major investigation into this matter. Candidates aren’t allowed to pay for ENDORSEMENTS, which is what Kamala did, under the guise of paying for entertainment. In addition, this was a very expensive and desperate effort to artificially build up her sparse crowds. IT’S NOT LEGAL! For these unpatriotic “entertainers,” this was just a CORRUPT & UNLAWFUL way to capitalize on a broken system. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!” This was followed up by a bizarre back and forth, in which Trump shared a fake clip on social media of him attacking The Boss with a golf ball. The post drew heavy criticism and mockery online, with many posting “reality shots” of Trump on the golf course, and others commenting on how “this is not what a president does.” Numerous musicians came to Springsteen’s defence, including Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder and veteran rocker Neil Young. Elsewhere, South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker responded to the White House’s reaction to their latest episode which mocked Trump, showing him in bed with Satan and depicting him as having a micro-penis. Trump, not Satan. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said: “Just like the creators of South Park, the Left has no authentic or original content, which is why their popularity continues to hit record lows. This show hasn’t been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention.” This led Parker to respond at Comic-Con International, with his trademark deadpan style: “We’re terribly sorry.” They weren’t.","summary":"Donald Trump's feud with A-list celebrities continues.

The Sunday magazine show continues to be one of the biggest draws for viewers on broadcast television. Which is why President Donald Trump's $20 billion lawsuit against CBS News and its parent company Paramount Global had such high stakes. Last fall, Trump took Paramount to court with allegations of election interference involving CBS News' handling of its \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the run-up to Election Day. He accused the company of aiding her campaign by deceitfully editing an exchange Harris had with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker who pressed her on why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't listening to the Biden administration. FCC APPROVES PARAMOUNT-SKYDANCE MERGER FOLLOWING TRUMP SETTLEMENT, COLBERT CANCELLATION Critics noticed that two different responses to the same question aired on the network; one in a preview clip that aired on \"Face the Nation\" in which Harris was widely panned for her \"word salad,\" the second airing during the primetime election special that had Harris giving a more succinct answer. Raw transcripts and footage from the interview ordered and released earlier this year by the FCC revealed the first half of her answer aired on \"Face the Nation\" while the second half aired on \"60 Minutes,\" contradicting Trump's repeated claims that CBS had sliced and diced an answer to a completely different question. However, that didn't stop the lawsuit from moving forward in Trump-friendly Texas. And despite the company's own motion declaring the lawsuit \"without basis in law and fact, and an affront to the First Amendment,\" Paramount settled with Trump in hopes of smoothing over its $8 billion merger with Skydance Media, which was just approved by Trump's FCC last week. CBS NEWS TAPS TANYA SIMON AS NEW ‘60 Minutes’ EXECUTIVE PRODUCER FOLLOWING TRUMP-PARAMOUNT SETTLEMENT A \"60 Minutes\" producer told Fox News Digital that colleagues had been \"psychologically and mentally worn down\" by the months-long drama that unfolded leading up to the settlement, which many learned about the following morning. An emergency Zoom meeting was organized by its then-interim executive producer Tanya Simon to wrangle most of the staff together during their summer vacation. \"The prevailing sentiment was like, this is what we were expecting. But it is a travesty,\" the producer said. \"A quote that has kind of been circulating around is, 'You can love your company, but your company won't love you back,'\" they chuckled. ‘60 MINUTES’ STAFF STAND BY KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S MAJOR PARAMOUNT LAWSUIT Paramount agreed to pay Trump $16 million for his presidential library. Fox News Digital was first to report that another eight-figure sum would be allocated for advertisements and public service announcements for conservative causes set to be funded by the new ownership. While the \"60 Minutes\" staff were upset by the settlement, the producer said no one is expected to resign in protest, something that could have happened if CBS News issued an apology, which Trump's legal team fought for but the network resisted tooth and nail. \"I think there would have been a more dramatic response to the settlement if there had been an apology. I think that would have forced some resignations,\" they said. \"That was a bright line for a lot of people.\" Staff were left scratching their heads about the editorial change that was reached in the settlement with CBS News pledging to release raw transcripts of interviews with presidential candidates going forward. \"Nothing has come down to us to say, like, this is the decision, this is why it was made and this is how you will move forward,\" the producer said. \"It's not very comforting when you feel like nobody really knows what's going on and no one from Paramount or CBS is communicating directly with- I mean, they are communicating, obviously, with the news division, but not in a way that trickles down to us.\" CBS STAFFERS REVOLT OVER PARAMOUNT'S ‘SHAMEFUL’ TRUMP SETTLEMENT, ‘BETRAYAL’ TO THE NETWORK'S JOURNALISTS \"60 Minutes\" staff will return to the office in August. The producer predicted colleagues will be \"energized\" and \"ready to work.\" There was a morale boost last week when CBS News officially announced that Simon would serve as the \"60 Minutes\" executive producer after she filled the role on an interim basis following the protest resignation of her predecessor, Bill Owens. Simon had broad support among the rank and file. \"This is a positive signal in terms of the future of ‘60 Minutes’ being able to stay true to its founding principles,\" the producer said about Simon's appointment. But the biggest concern for the journalists of \"60 Minutes\" is whether there will be attempts at corporate influence over its editorial decisions, especially as CBS will have new ownership after August 7, when the Paramount-Skydance deal closes. Owens left \"60 Minutes\" in April, claiming he could no longer maintain editorial independence after Shari Redstone, Paramount's then-controlling shareholder, wanted to keep tabs on stories pertaining to the Trump administration. While Redstone recused herself from negotiations, she vocalized her support for a settlement in order to prevent potential retribution from Trump's FCC, which could've blocked the Skydance merger. Skydance reportedly committed to FCC Chair Brendan Carr that it would install an ombudsman to oversee CBS News content after the merger. \"I think there'll be a high, high degree of vigilance in terms of is there a different type of oversight or meddling in our story choice or how we report on our stories,\" the producer said. CBS News, Paramount nor Skydance did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
