Lately, he has had a lot of thoughts about where a proposed new Washington Commanders stadium should go. (Maryland, obviously.)\n\nShapiro served as a game analyst for a University of Pittsburgh basketball broadcast last month. And Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky is already preparing to do the rounds of podcasts and shows at the Kentucky Derby this spring.\n\nVoters, Beshear said, want \"candidates and people serving who don't just sound like normal human beings, but they are normal human beings.\"\n\n\"Talking about sports, going to watch sports and talking to people as you meet them about sports, just shows that you, too, are a normal human being,\" he said.\n\nThese Democratic governors are broadening their outreach to voters at a political moment when Trump showed up at the Super Bowl and the Daytona 500 and is considering a posthumous pardon for Pete Rose, the baseball legend barred for betting on games.\n\n\"It takes the politics out of it,\" said Walz, whose career as a high school football coach was often highlighted after he became the Democratic nominee for vice president last year. \"When I go out there and go on those shows, it shows you're a real human being and it connects with people on something they care about.\"\n\nCertainly, Americans have long mixed sports and politics, and many of these Democrats were talking sports well before the last election. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, who once aspired to be a sports broadcaster, appeared on the \"Locked on Lions\" podcast last spring to talk about the NFL draft, which was held in Detroit.\n\nBut the postelection appearances have been especially striking, particularly because former Vice President Kamala Harris appeared on only a few sports shows during the fall campaign.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nThe Harris campaign tried but failed to have her appear on popular podcasts hosted by sports commentator Bill Simmons and the Kelce brothers of professional football, according to a person who sought to arrange her media interviews. (The campaign also failed in its efforts to book her with podcaster Joe Rogan and the \"Hot Ones\" YouTube show, which interviews celebrities as they eat blisteringly spicy chicken wings.)\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nIn recent weeks, Democrats including Shapiro; Moore; Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader; former Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, who resigned in scandal and is now running for mayor of New York City; and Rep. Ro Khanna of California have made time to chat with Stephen A. Smith, the ESPN personality. Smith, for his part, has espoused so many thoughts on politics lately that his name has begun to show up in fantasy 2028 Democratic presidential primary polling.\n\nSmith, who agreed last week to a $100 million contract that allows him to delve more into politics, conferred instant sports credibility to Shapiro, seeming to compare him to basketball superstar Michael Jordan. Smith also said he would be willing to campaign for Moore.\n\nFor his part, Shapiro, who spoke with Smith before the Super Bowl, correctly predicted that his hometown Philadelphia Eagles would be able to contain Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n\nAnd though Shapiro reveled in the Eagles' Super Bowl victory, his true sports passion is basketball. During a recent interview, he spoke at length about the aging and oft-injured roster of the Philadelphia 76ers, a team he said had failed to adapt to modern basketball.\n\n\"Teams that are trying to win with like a Big Two or Big Three, as the Sixers attempted to do, aren't having as much success in the league right now,\" Shapiro said. \"That's compounded when you have injuries that they do. It's really troubling.\"\n\nShapiro's unsparing analysis of his 76ers would not be out of line on Philadelphia sports radio -- to which he has been known to call in as \"Josh in Abington,\" a reference to his hometown north of the city.\n\nSpeaking hard truths about hometown teams -- and where one's loyalties lie -- is a vehicle for politicians to convey authenticity.\n\n\"It's very important for politicians -- especially Democrats, if they want to try to reach the sports radio audience -- they got to be who they are,\" said Matt Jones, a prominent sports radio host in Kentucky who considered, but then decided against, a 2020 challenge to Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former Republican leader. \"In the sports world, people don't like fakes. They're fine with you not rooting for their team, but you better not lie about who you root for.\"\n\nIndeed, sports bigamy can exacerbate a politician's image as a flip-flopper -- or worse, as someone willing to say whatever is expedient. Just ask Hillary Clinton, who at different times in her political life claimed to be a fan of both the Chicago Cubs and the New York Yankees.\n\nHolding true to one's sports loyalties can also backfire. Bill de Blasio never gave up his Boston Red Sox allegiance, which became a problem when he was mayor of New York. Chris Christie used to sit in the Dallas Cowboys owner's box and cheer against the New York Giants and the Eagles -- teams with huge followings in New Jersey, where he was governor.\n\nMoore presents himself as Maryland's No. 1 fan of the Baltimore Ravens and the Baltimore Orioles. But he is also upfront about being a convert. He spent part of his childhood in the Bronx during the New York Mets' glory years in the 1980s. In a 1996 interview with The New York Times, Moore said he dreamed of being drafted into the NBA by the New York Knicks.\n\nIn a recent interview, Moore said he had given up most of his New York sports allegiances -- except for the Knicks.\n\n\"The Mets are still kind of like, you know, your ex-girlfriend, who you're like, 'Yeah, that was fun back in the day,' but there is no doubt that I'm married to the Orioles,\" Moore said.\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nHe also delivered a monologue lasting 1 minute 33 seconds about why Jackson should have been named the NFL's MVP last year over Josh Allen, the Buffalo Bills quarterback.\n\nBut that argument is rejected by another prominent Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul of New York, according to her spokesperson.\n\nHochul, a Buffalo native and a Bills fanatic, did her own round of sports podcast appearances during her team's playoff run in January.\n\n\"You don't have to say, 'Hi' or 'Goodbye,'\" she told \"The Buffalo Football Podcast.\" \"You just have to say, 'Go Bills.'\"\n\nIn states without professional teams, governors tend to focus on college athletics. Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut called the current men's basketball team at the University of Connecticut \"erratic\" but praised its women's team as being \"on fire.\"\n\nAnd in Kentucky, Beshear, a Vanderbilt University alumnus, backs both the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville teams, despite their longstanding and intense basketball rivalry.\n\n\"As governor, you have two jobs when it comes to collegiate basketball,\" he said. \"No. 1, to root for your in-state schools, and No. 2, to root against Duke.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"\"I hate the Packers,\" Gov.

With the benefit of hindsight, Walz wished that the Democrats would have made time for more face-to-face interactions with voters.\n\n“We shouldn’t have been playing this thing so safe,” Walz told the outlet. \"I think we probably should have just rolled the dice and done the town halls, where [voters] may say, ‘you’re full of shit, I don’t believe in you.’”\n\nIn a campaign season that saw eventual victor Donald Trump record interviews with Joe Rogan and Adin Ross, Walz felt that the party was far too precious with their chosen candidates' media appearances. Walz said this strategy was born out of a sense of inevitable victory, the same sort of thinking that was behind the Democrats' last presidential election loss.\n\n\"We, as a party, are more cautious,” Walz said. \"In football parlance, we were in a prevent defense to not lose when we never had anything to lose because I don’t think we were ever ahead.\"\n\nWalz has pitched his vision for a bolder, more aggressive Democratic Party since November. With the collapse of Democratic turnout for Harris' moderate campaign, Walz thinks it's up to the party to meet voters where they are on more progressive positions.\n\n\"When we get back, which we will – we'll fight – I’ll tell you what people are going to expect is they're not going to expect us to tinker around the edge with the ACA [Affordable Care Act.] They're going to expect universal health care,\" Walz shared during a visit to \"Fast Politics\" late last month. “A saying I always said is, ‘You lead with good policy and good politics will follow.’\"","summary":"The Minnesota governor and former vice presidential candidate said Dems ran as if they were in the lead","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/03/09/we-shouldnt-have-played-it-safe-walz-critiques-2024-campaign-strategy-of-prevent-defense/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2024/10/tim_walz_2175520631.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 20:21:10","author":"Alex Galbraith","authors":["Alex Galbraith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.46},{"id":298416220,"title":"Trump Pulled $400 Million From Columbia. Other Schools Could Be Next.","text":"The Trump administration's abrupt withdrawal of $400 million in federal funding from Columbia University in New York cast a pall over at least nine other campuses worried they could be next.\n\nThe schools, a mix that includes both public universities and Ivy League institutions, have been placed on an official administration list of schools that the Department of Justice said may have failed to protect Jewish students and faculty.\n\nFaculty leaders at many of the schools have pushed back strongly against claims that their campuses are hotbeds of antisemitism, noting that although some Jewish students complained that they felt unsafe, the vast majority of protesters were peaceful and many of the protest participants were Jewish.\n\nThe Trump administration has made targeting higher education a priority. Last week, President Donald Trump threatened in a social media post to punish any school that permits \"illegal\" protests. On Jan. 30, he signed an executive order on combating antisemitism, focusing on what he called anti-Jewish racism at \"leftists\" universities. Then, on Feb. 3, he announced the creation of a multiagency task force to carry out the mandate.\n\nThe task force appeared to move into action quickly after a pro-Palestinian sit-in and protest at Barnard College, a partner school to Columbia, on Feb. 26. Two days later, the administration released its list of 10 schools under scrutiny, including Columbia, the site of large pro-Palestinian encampments last year.\n\nIt said it would be paying the schools a visit, part of a review process to consider \"whether remedial action is warranted.\" Then on Friday, it announced it would be canceling millions of dollars in grants and contracts with Columbia.\n\nHarvard University, whose former president, Claudine Gay, resigned last year after a bruising appearance before a House committee, is also on the list.\n\nSo are George Washington University; Johns Hopkins University; New York University; Northwestern University; UCLA; the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Minnesota; and the University of Southern California.\n\nThe Trump administration's moves to hobble university funding and target schools over claims that they tolerated antisemitism had already caused internal recalibration at schools across the country. Some have stepped up lobbying efforts, including hiring lobbyists with connections to Trump.\n\nMany campuses had already cracked down on students over protest activity. More are dialing back or renaming efforts related to diversity, an effort to avoid the ire of Trump officials who have vowed to end such programs\n\nAnd a number have paused hiring and reduced the number of doctoral students admitted in response to the financial uncertainty.\n\nSome school officials have said they face an \"existential threat.\" Still, many presidents have been silent or muted in their public statements about Trump's moves against the sector, appearing to retreat in fear of the new administration.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, Harvard said it was \"committed to ensuring our Jewish community is embraced, respected, and can thrive at Harvard, and to our efforts to confront antisemitism and all forms of hate.\"\n\nSeveral days after Trump's inauguration, the president, Dr. Alan Garber, posted a message to the university cowritten with other administration leaders.\n\n\"In these challenging times,\" they wrote, \"our efforts will be guided by our values and commitments: supporting academic excellence and the pursuit of knowledge; championing open inquiry, constructive dialogue, and academic freedom.\"\n\nThe selection criteria for being on the list for visits is nebulous, but a number of the schools had been included in a report in October by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, which claimed they had allowed antisemitic behavior by students and faculty.\n\nThe report criticized Harvard leaders, citing their initial failure to condemn the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023.\n\nNorthwestern and its president, Michael Schill, also had been under attack by the House committee, then led by Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C. The committee report criticized the university for placing \"radical anti-Israel faculty\" in charge of negotiations with protesters.\n\nUC Berkeley was identified in the House report for not disciplining students who took part in an encampment or disrupted a talk by an Israeli speaker.\n\nUC Berkeley issued a statement Saturday saying, \"We are confident we have the right processes in place now to respond to any antisemitic incidents.\" The statement cited an advisory committee the chancellor formed on Jewish student life and campus antisemitism.\n\nWhile several of the schools have been focal points for campus protests, others are more of a surprise.\n\nRichard Painter, a professor of law at Minnesota, was among those who filed a complaint about antisemitism at the university. He had chafed at incidents on campus, including anti-Israeli statements posted by faculty on official department websites.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nEven so, Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, wondered if the school was targeted partly because it sits in the congressional district of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., a vocal critic of both Israel and Trump's, and in the home state of Gov. Tim Walz, who ran on the ticket with former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"Part of it is political,\" he said in an interview Saturday.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nOfficials at Minnesota could not be reached for comment, but efforts are already underway to address the complaints. The Board of Regents is expected to vote Friday on a resolution prohibiting individual departments from making political statements on issues of the day.\n\nThere was evidence suggesting that the administration's action against Columbia was accelerated by last month's sit-in at Barnard, which led to additional protests recently. The protests were sparked by Barnard's decision to expel two students who interrupted a class on Israel.\n\nOn March 3, six days after the initial Barnard disturbance, the government sent a notice to Columbia that it would review $51 million in federal contracts, citing harassment of Jewish students.\n\nThe next day, Trump released a statement on Truth Social saying, in part, \"All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests.\"\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nIn a news release Friday announcing the cancellation of $400 million in grants and contracts, the task force also accused Columbia of failing to respond to the earlier notice while antisemitic harassment continued on or near campus.\n\nOn Friday, Columbia said it was reviewing the administration's announcement and that it pledged to work with the government.\n\nAlso on Friday, Linda McMahon, the newly installed secretary of education, met with Columbia's interim president, Dr. Katrina Armstrong. McMahon issued a statement saying that schools \"must comply with all federal anti-discrimination laws\" to receive federal funding.\n\nThe task force's list was released in late February amid a flurry of executive orders from the White House.\n\nMembers of the task force include Leo Terrell, a senior Justice Department lawyer. Efforts to reach Terrell were not successful Saturday. It was also unclear if any of the campus visits had been scheduled.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"The Trump administration's abrupt withdrawal of $400 million in federal funding from Columbia University in New York cast a pall over at least nine other campuses worried they could be next.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/trump-pulled-400-million-from-columbia-other-schools-could-be-next/article_08c83412-abb3-5c13-a45c-b39eefbfaabf.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 19:36:07","author":"North Adams Pride,Stephanie Saul","authors":["North Adams Pride","Stephanie Saul"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":298381388,"title":"Full transcript of \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" March 9, 2025","text":"On this \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" broadcast, moderated by Margaret Brennan: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi NoemKirsten Hillman, Canadian ambassador to the U.S.Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Tom Suozzi, Democrat of New YorkFiona Hill, former White House Russia expertClick here to browse full transcripts from 2025 of \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump's tariff threats rattle allies and adversaries alike, plus the latest on the administration's immigration crackdown.After a whiplash week of on-again/off-again tariffs, the Trump trade war is entering a new phase, as the president steps up his threats against America's neighbors.(Begin VT)DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): We don't need trees from Canada. We don't need cars from Canada. We don't need energy from Canada. We don't need anything from Canada.(End VT)MARGARET BRENNAN: And acknowledges the possibility of economic disruption.(Begin VT)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: There could be some disturbance, a little bit of disturbance.(End VT)MARGARET BRENNAN: The administration says it hopes the tariffs will pressure Canada and Mexico to stop the flow of fentanyl and illegal migrants into the U.S.We will ask Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem if it's working and we will get the latest on the president's mass deportation mission.Canada's ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, will also be here. We will ask her about the costs and consequences of the growing trade war.Plus, with just days to go before a possible government shutdown, lawmakers unveil a new bill to avoid it. We will hear from the co-chairs of the congressional Problem Solvers Caucus, Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick and New York Democrat Tom Suozzi.Finally, Russia expert Fiona Hill, who served as a top National Security Council official during the first Trump administration, joins us to discuss Trump's diplomatic pivot on Ukraine.It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.We begin this morning with the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem.Madam Secretary, good to have you in person. Thank you for joining us.KRISTI NOEM (U.S. Homeland Security Secretary): Yes, good morning. Thank you for having me.MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to dive right into this trade war.The justification President Trump invoked these tariffs under had to do with fentanyl. Mexico's president said Thursday that Customs and Border Protection figures show seizures of fentanyl on the southern border have dropped over the past year. She claimed they plummeted 75 percent in the past six months.Doesn't that show the existing system is working?SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We've seen incredible progress as far as what we've been able to stop at the southern border since President Trump has taken office.And I think that progress can be built on. These partnerships that we have in going after traffickers, cartels, the drug trade, and also human trafficking can be even stronger and built on in the future. That's one of the things we've been asking for, in specific to the Mexican government, is, how can we work better together to make sure we not only have the enforcement mission at the border, but south of the border and make sure we're going after these cartels?You've seen the president name them as terrorist organizations. And Canada just recently is starting to allow us to access some of their criminal background histories that we need in order to know who's coming across our border and what they're bringing. So, because of his strong stance on tariffs, we're seeing them wanting to be better partners with us to keep our people safe.MARGARET BRENNAN: So Canada's Prime Minister said it's totally false to claim Canada is unwilling to fight fentanyl. You just indicated they're willing to do more here.He pointed to CBP data that showed a 97 percent drop in fentanyl seizures from January compared to December, a near zero low, he said.SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Yes, we're…MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the data accurate?SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: The data is getting better. And I would say, in the conversations that I have had this week with Canadian officials, they were hoping to avoid the tariffs, and had a lot of conversations, but not a lot of action.So this is the hope, is that the fact that President Trump has said something and now has enforced consequences, we really are hoping for even better partnerships. We need access to their criminal background system, so that we know, when someone crosses that northern border, who they are, why they're in our country, and who they may be partnering with.We also need them to work with us on identifying packages, technology investments. Canada has said they will do that. We just want to see them actually do it. In the past, promises have been made by both Mexico and Canada that they didn't follow through on. Their naming of a fentanyl czar in Canada is important. That's great. Now let's see really what happens.President Trump has been strong, and I think that's why you've seen the data going our direction. But, boy, every day, people in this country are dying of overdoses. And I don't want any more families to have to deal with that tragedy if we can be – if it can be avoided and we can have a stronger relationship.MARGARET BRENNAN: So you just gave specific examples of what Canada and Mexico can do presumably to avoid the tariffs that are now being pushed off until April 2.SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Correct.MARGARET BRENNAN: The commerce secretary said on another network: \"If fentanyl ends, I think these will come off, but if fentanyl does not end, or he's uncertain about it,\" meaning the president, \"they will stay on until he's comfortable.Is it that general, or are these very specific things that you can kind of go through and check to avoid these tariffs?SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Yes, I have had very specific conversations with Canadian officials and Mexican officials on what they can do. So they know what they can do to help avoid tariffs in the future, and what we're expecting of them.If they do it, we shall see. We all recognize that each one of these leaders has political environments in their home countries as well, but President Trump means business. And he meant it when he ran to be president of the United States again and since he's taken office that he will put America first.And every day in this country, we have seen over the last several years violence and unsafe streets and cities and people lose their children and grandchildren, and he's taking action to make sure that we're cleaning up the mess that Joe Biden left behind, and that we have a much safer country, and where Americans can look forward to the future.MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is not just leverage to get a better free trade deal? This is not just because President Trump truly believes that tariffs are the heart of his economic policy?SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Right.MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying this really is about fentanyl?SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: It really is about fentanyl. It really is.And I think the president obviously wants a strong economy, obviously wants better trade deals as well. But this is about fentanyl and what we can do to stop the cartels from partnering with Chinese officials, laundering money and bringing a poison into our country that is specifically designed to kill the next generation.I think a lot of people don't understand the strategy…MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: … of these enemies of the United States and what they're utilizing.They are bringing this in, not just to make money. They're bringing it in here to kill Americans. And it's time that we stand up for the people that live here and make sure that we're stopping this war against our children.MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you.Border crossings, they're at a 25-year low.SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: They are. It's fantastic.MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 6,000 U.S. military personnel working at the border now. That number could go up to 9,000 by the end of the month.How long do you have to keep them there if the numbers are already dropping like this?SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: You know, we'll continue the partnership with the Department of Defense.But, also, we've got partnerships with Commerce, with the attorney general's office. You know, we're working every day with the secretary of state. We'll keep them there until that border is completely secure. And we see all-time record lows of encounters. Our Border Patrol is doing fantastic work.But we're going to keep them there until the whole world gets the message that this isn't Joe Biden's world anymore. This is President Donald Trump's country, where we have a border, where we have laws, and it applies equally to everybody. I think that is what is so refreshing, is that we're not picking and choosing winners and losers anymore.Americans have to live by the law. So do those who come to this country. You have to come here legally, or there will be consequences.MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what's happening internally when it comes to – excuse me – migration.The administration has revived this policy of detaining migrant families, parents with children, in ICE detention centers. Bush did it. Obama did it. Biden did not. Have you seen these Texas facilities where children are being held with their parents? Are you comfortable with it personally?SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We've got detention facilities across the country, and there's specific ones that are built specifically for families if they are detained.But, remember, everybody has an option. They have an option to be here legally or illegally, and they can self-deport as well. We've set up a system and a Web site where people who are here illegally right now can register, and they can choose to go home on their own and keep their families united.MARGARET BRENNAN: The kids don't have a choice in this. You know that.SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, the kids do have a choice. If they have parents, they make a choice to keep their families together, if they want to or not. They – if parents make a decision to leave their children behind, then that's a choice that they made as a family.And we need to remember that when Americans break the law, and they have consequences or face a situation, they're separated from their families too. I don't believe we should prioritize people from other countries above Americans.MARGARET BRENNAN: But when it comes to reviving the policy of separating families from their children at the border…SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I don't know that we're actually reviving it.MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what I want to ask you.SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: It's that President Biden didn't follow the law.MARGARET BRENNAN: You won't…SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: He didn't follow the law, in the fact that it's always been equally applied until his administration, and then he made decisions to ignore federal law in how he handled immigration and enforcement within our borders.And so, today, we're – we're expanding our team at ICE, and we're going to have an acting director in Todd Lyons, who has a long history with Tom Homan. They have worked together to build on these enforcement operations. We're also naming a deputy secretary in Madison Sheahan. That was going to be another expansion of this team.They have done incredible work cleaning up our communities and making them safer. Adding more people to the team, with Todd and with Madison, is going to allow us to partner with local law enforcement officials to make sure that we truly are following through on enforcing the law. And, if you break our law, then there's going to be consequences.MARGARET BRENNAN: al Qaeda you want the number of deportations to tick up?(CROSSTALK)SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I do, absolutely.MARGARET BRENNAN: So…SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: People, remember, they have an option to go home on their own.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We are giving them that opportunity to do that, and we will help facilitate that. And if they don't, and they end up coming into our enforcement opportunities that we have in front of us, you know, they may never get the chance to come back. So people need to remember, if they self-deport, they will have an opportunity to come back to this country legally.MARGARET BRENNAN: But you have a capacity issue right now in terms of just beds to put people in when you detain them. Are you going to open up military facilities like Fort Bliss?SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: There is, yes, a plan to use the facilities at Fort Bliss for detention facilities.But, also, we need to remember to ask – Congress needs to continue through with funding that this administration has asked for. You know, we clearly have a C.R. discussion in front of us this week. We have a reconciliation discussion. That reconciliation bill needs to happen. We have just weeks before we are out of the funds to continue the operations that – that we have.And even – everywhere I have been in this country out there, looking at what President Trump has done on immigration and border enforcement, the people that I meet are saying, thank you. Thank you for getting these terrorists out of the country. He has deported…MARGARET BRENNAN: Terrorists?SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: … in just one month…MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you deported terrorists?SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: … 22 known and – terrorists on the terrorist watch list are out of this country now.We have almost 700 gang members that have been deported out of the country in just a month, and…(CROSSTALK)MARGARET BRENNAN: … which have been redefined as foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, 281 specific TDA members, which we know are the worst of the worst, have been taken out of this country.So, everyone that has a story like Laken Riley's family or Jocelyn's family, they're extremely grateful that that won't be perpetuated amongst other families in other states.MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you. You said that you have found leakers within DHS and you're going to prosecute them.Back on February 9, you tweeted: \"The FBI is so corrupt.We will work with any and every agency to stop leaks.\"Were you wrong then to blame the FBI if the leaks were from within DHS?SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: No, I think there's leakers all over throughout this government. I think that everybody needs to be…MARGARET BRENNAN: What did they leak?SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I think these – in DHS specifically, these two were leaking our enforcement operations that we had planned and were going to conduct in several cities and exposed law enforcement to vulnerabilities, to those ops being jeopardized, to where their lives would be in danger.So they will be prosecuted, and they could face up to 10 years in federal prison because they did that. Anyone who is leaking information outside of – of how something is planned for the safety of those law enforcement officers needs to be held accountable for that.MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're going to continue these polygraphing…SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Absolutely.MARGARET BRENNAN: … of employees?SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: The authorities that I have under the Department of Homeland Security are broad and extensive. And I plan to use every single one of them to make sure that we're following the law, that we are following the procedures in place to keep people safe, and that we're making sure we're following through on what President Trump has promised, that he's going to make America safe again.MARGARET BRENNAN: Madam Secretary, thank you for your time today.SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Thank you for having me.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: Canadian officials are warning of retaliation against the U.S. over President Trump's tariff threats.Senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe has the latest from Ottawa.ED O'KEEFE: Well, Margaret, President Trump is now threatening tariffs on Canadian dairy and lumber exports, even as he holds off on the broader tariffs on goods covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement until at least early April.This has mostly been a war of words so far, rather than a war over the wallet, but that's going to change in the coming day, as Ontario is now threatening to tariff electricity it wires to Minnesota, Michigan and New York.(Begin VT)DOUG FORD (Premier of Ontario, Canada): I'm going to put a 25 percent tariff on the electricity, the 1.5 million homes and businesses, as of Monday, until President Trump drops these tariffs.He has to understand that he can't attack our country economically and expect us to roll over.(End VT)ED O'KEEFE: It's not entirely clear how the cost of those tariffs would be passed on to American households.Now, we're here in Ottawa today because, amid the tariff war, there's also a Canadian transfer of power under way. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in January he would be stepping down after nearly a decade. His ruling Liberal Party today anoints his successor.It's a race between Mark Carney, an economist and the former head of the Banks of Canada and Britain, and Chrystia Freeland, a former Trudeau deputy. Whoever wins the race, Margaret, becomes prime minister and has to deal with President Trump and the tariff war.MARGARET BRENNAN: That was our Ed O'Keefe in Ottawa.We're joined now by Canada's ambassador to the United States, Kirsten Hillman.Ambassador, it's good to have you here.KIRSTEN HILLMAN (Canadian Ambassador to the United States): Thanks for having me, Margaret.MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the homeland security secretary say there are conversations with your government. She seemed optimistic that there would be follow-through on fentanyl.Does that make you think the threat of tariffs on April 2 is something that can be managed and avoided?AMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Well, I hope so.I mean, it – I think that we are in a very good place in our discussions with the U.S. administration on fentanyl. We have invested a lot of new resources. We have given our law enforcement new powers. And we have responded to the requests of the Trump administration with respect to cooperative effects in getting at the sources, so the organized crime, the precursors coming from China.We've had some really, really good discussions. So we're optimistic. And, you know, I just would say, and I think it's important for your viewers to know, fentanyl is a very serious problem in Canada too. On some days, we have more deaths per capita than you have here in the United States.So we take this very seriously. It is not a big issue between our two countries. Less than 1 percent of the fentanyl that is seized in the United States is coming from Canada, but every ounce can kill families and people. So we're taking it very seriously.MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are indulging the premise that that is the actual motivation for the tariffs, rather than leverage for a free trade deal or just because President Trump believes in them?AMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Well, I think that this set of tariffs, the 25 and 10 percent set of tariffs, are – we have been told repeatedly that it is about fentanyl and security at the border.There are other tariffs that have been discussed, and the president has raised other issues as motivations for other tariffs, reciprocity and fairness, and, you know, maybe some changes that he'd like to see to our USMCA, our trade agreement. So those conversations are going to have to happen as well.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump said Friday he may put tariffs on Canadian lumber and dairy Monday or Tuesday. Here's what he said. Take a listen:(Begin VT)DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Canada has been ripping us off for years on tariffs for lumber and for dairy products, 250 percent. Nobody ever talks about that, 250 percent tariff, which is taking advantage of our farmers. So that's not going to happen anymore.We're going to be – they'll be met with the exact same tariff unless they drop it. And that's what reciprocal means.(End VT)MARGARET BRENNAN: On another network, the commerce secretary said, no, that's actually on hold until April 2.It's confusing for us to follow this along. Is the clarity with the two governments any better?AMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: You know, we are in active discussions with Secretary Lutnick. And those discussions are heading towards April 2.And that, I think, is – we are putting our energy in the substantive discussions that we are having with the secretary, with USTR, with the White House. And, you know, that is, I guess, how I can answer that question.The president – the president does have a variety of concerns and I think also sees tariffs as a tool for a variety of policy objectives. But, really, all we can do is focus on the real work at hand, which is to get at these issues, like, for example, lumber. Canada doesn't have a tariff on lumber. It's zero. U.S. lumber can come into Canada duty-free.On dairy, the U.S. sells three times as much dairy into Canada as we sell into the United States. So, what's more, I think, productive for us is to talk about the facts around the actual trading relationship and try and get at where the concerns are.MARGARET BRENNAN: But Canada does put a tariff as high as 241 percent on dairy imports, but it's a sliding scale that only kicks in at a certain level, and that's under the free trade deal.AMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: That's right.MARGARET BRENNAN: So…AMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: And it's like the United States. In agriculture, the United States is the same.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.AMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: In sugar and dairy, you allow a certain amount of product in, and then, after that level is hit, you put restraints in on imports. And we do the same to protect our farmers and families and, you know, small family farms that – that need to be sure that they can have a bit of the market.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there was this 50-minute phone call Wednesday with the vice president, the commerce secretary and President Trump with your prime minister, Justin Trudeau.Afterwards, the president posted that Trudeau was unable to tell him when the election was taking place, which made him curious, like – quote – \"What's going on here? I then realized he's trying to use this issue to stay in power.\"Do you think this is, like, a personal issue here? Do you think it'll change when your leadership changes?AMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: It's hard for me to – hard for me to say.I think that the prime minister and the president, Prime Minister Trudeau and the president, they've done big things together, right? They did renegotiate NAFTA together.MARGARET BRENNAN: They have a history together.AMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Right. They have a long history. They did good things together. They managed our 6,000 – practically 6,000-mile border during COVID very successfully, in my opinion.So it's a long relationship, and has many – has had many phases to it. We will have a new prime minister this week. Today, the Liberal Party will elect a new leader. That new leader will be sworn in, in the coming days, and that person will become Canada's prime minister. Those are facts that are not going to change.MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it will stop the vows from the president to talk about threatening to annex Canada?AMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: You know, I guess what I can…MARGARET BRENNAN: What is that?AMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: I – I – yes, I – I'm – I'm not sure what that is.What I can say is that Canadians don't really appreciate it. They're getting a little bit frustrated with that kind of rhetoric. But, more importantly, Canadians are frustrated with our neighbors, you know, the country that we feel closest to, the country that is partners, allies, often family that we've gone to war with, that we've died with, that we come to each other's aid, most recently in L.A., but obviously 9/11.You've come to our aid over the years so many times. And we feel – Canadians feel under attack, under economic attack. And that is causing some challenges, for sure, across Canadian society. I think our new prime minister, when that person comes in, will prioritize trying to have a good and – and healthy and productive relationship with the president.I am sure that that's going to be possible. Relationships go both ways, but I know that, on our side, that's going to be a priority.MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, thank you for joining us.AMBASSADOR KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Thanks.MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.Stay with us.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to another front in President Trump's trade war, and that's China.Foreign correspondent Anna Coren is in Beijing with the latest.ANNA COREN: A tone of defiance from Beijing this week, with China preparing for a protracted trade war with the United States, which it maintains will have no winners.It announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products and targeted 25 American companies in response to the now 20 percent blanket tariffs President Trump placed on all Chinese goods.In a press conference on the sidelines of the National People's Congress, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the country would fight back, despite economic challenges at home. And without naming President Trump, he accused the U.S. of being duplicitous in its relationship with China, saying:(Begin VT)(FOREIGN MINISTER WANG YI SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)(End VT)ANNA COREN: \"No country should expect to suppress and contain China on one hand while maintaining good relations with China on the other.\"Well, earlier this week, his ministry used particularly aggressive language, stating: \"If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we're ready to fight until the end.\"While there's no doubt a trade war will hurt China's economy, it's had six years to prepare for this since a trade war began in 2018. And, Margaret, despite being open to negotiations, its decision to opt for defiance, rather than flattery, is a sign China won't back down.MARGARET BRENNAN: Anna Coren in Beijing.We will be right back.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation, including an interview with the bipartisan co-chairs of the Congressional Problem Solvers Caucus, Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick and New York Democrat Tom Suozzi, plus the latest on President Trump's push for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia.Stay with us.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.We're joined now by the co-chairs of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick, represents a district that was narrowly carried by Kamala Harris, and New York Democrat Tom Suozzi, represents a district that went for President Trump.So, you all have to find the middle. And that brings you together and brings you here today. It's good to see, in a bipartisan fashion, this conversation take place.But I want to start with you, Congressman Fitzpatrick.There is this potential government shutdown looming March the 14th. Speaker Johnson says there's going to be a vote on Tuesday. Will Republicans be able to pass this on party lines or do you need Democratic votes?REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK (R-PA): Well, that remains to be seen. You know, the text was just released yesterday compliant with the 72-hour rule before a vote. We're still digging through it, like most bills. There's some good in there. There's some not so good in there. And we've got to make an accurate decision.I will say, you know, Tom and I are friends. We came in together. We obviously co-chair this bipartisan group together. And we do lament the fact of any single party bill.The construct in this country is, if you get 218 votes, you get everything. If you get 217 votes, you get nothing. And that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.So, the reason that we do what we do is we want two-party solutions, including on the CR. So, it remains to be seen whether the votes are there or not, but I think we're really going to be learning, over the next 24 hours, what's in it and what's not in it.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you haven't decided your vote?REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Correct.MARGARET BRENNAN: What about you, Congressman Suozzi, because Leader Jeffries initially said in a letter that Democrats cannot back it. You have the text. Are you a no?REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI (D-NY): Right now, I'm a no. I mean, there's been no outreach on a bipartisan basis. What Brian and I are trying to do in this environment, you can imagine, is not too easy.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Everything's very fractured. Everything's very divisive. And to overcome that requires trust building and requires people to work together.In the case of this CR, there's been offers to negotiate, and there's been very little negotiation. It's kind of been a my way or the highway type of thing. And I think that's going to go on for a while. I think that the leadership is going to try and do my way or the highway for a while and then at some point they're going to need Democratic votes and then people start negotiating.MARGARET BRENNAN: Awhile, meaning we could be staring down a shutdown March 14th?REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, we'll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday. I believe the government funding runs out at the end of the week.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We're scheduled to end votes on Wednesday. Oftentimes, that does not happen during weeks like this. But it's incumbent upon every legislator to read the text and to make an aggregate decision. Does the good outweigh the bad?MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We never want to shut the government down. It's why I think we need no budget, no pay. If you cut legislator's funding off if they don't pass a CR or a budget, I think you'll have a much different outcome. So, people need to put their money where their mouth is.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Right now, the Republicans are counting on all the Republicans in the House to stick together to pass this through the House with no Democratic votes. That's what they're counting on. That's why they've conducted themselves this way.Then it goes to the Senate. In the Senate, you need 60 votes. You don't have 60 votes with the Senate Republicans. So, it's going to become a challenge for the Senate Republicans and the Senate Democrats to decide, who's going to get blamed for this thing?MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And wouldn't it be better if we all just worked together to try and find common ground the way we -MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: This is not normal what we're doing. The idea of a full year continuing resolution is not the normal process.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And there's a lot of bad stuff that I see in this bill that I don't like.REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And I will add, Margaret, I've lived through government shutdowns as an FBI agent, and it's horrific. Title Three wire taps get shut down, surveillance teams get shut down. It is massive implications that most people don't realize. You never ever want to shut the government down. It should never happen. And it's a symptom of a broken system that we're even talking about this.MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me follow up with you on that. You are the only FBI agent who - now a congressman. On Monday, the top agent at the New York office, James Dennehy, said he was forced out of his job due to clashes with Justice Department officials over directives. He had been supportive of bureau leaders who resisted turning over the nations of those agents assigned to carry out investigations related to January the 6th, 2021. Are you concerned about all this political pressure?REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: I'm very concerned. I'm a huge defender and supporter of the bureau. It was the best job I ever had in my life, and most honorable job I've ever had in my life, keeping America safe. And I care very much about the agent population and the professional support staff that worked there. They're a tremendous people. They are completely nonpartisan. At 14 years in the FBI, I never heard any political talk whatsoever, which is pretty remarkable. So -MARGARET BRENNAN: That directly contradicts what the Homeland Security secretary said at the top of this program when she talked - she went at the FBI. The FBI director was -REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, there have been conflicts at the top. I want - I want to differentiate. So, there have been problems on the seventh floor of the J. Edgar Hoover Building that they did politicize things, things like - people like Jim Comey, for example, who tweet out, you know, to vote single party during an election. You can't do that as an FBI director. That's terrible. He did it as a former director, but it undermines everything he did leading up to that point.The FBI needs to be completely nonpartisan, completely apolitical. Personally, I think that part of the polygraph testing that comes in, so when you're an agent coming through the process, you get tested on drug history, foreign contacts, financial vulnerabilities. They also ought to test political bias as well, just to give the public the assurance that people are coming into the bureau, checking their politics at the door.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: This all comes down to a busting of norms. And things that we've been used to for years are all trying to be disrupted, and I think, in some ways, very dangerously. We can't see this politization of the FBI. It's a dangerous thing for our country.MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to talk to the FBI director about any of this?REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Absolutely. Absolutely.MARGARET BRENNAN: About the firing for the political (INAUDIBLE)?REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: On past - Director - Director Patel worked on our committee.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: He was a staffer on the House Intelligence Committee, which I sit. And I look forward to having a conversation with him.MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Suozzi, illegal border crossings, as we just discussed, they are at a historic low. President Trump made that point when he was addressing Congress this week. Was he right that - that he didn't need to wait for Congress, that it was really messaging from the White House beyond?REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Well, obviously, we've seen a reduction in crossings. We saw it under the end of the Biden administration as well after he did his executive order to say, no, asylum applications are between the ports of entry. But we need to make it permanent law. And Congress has not done its job for 30 years. So, we need to secure the border, we need to fix the broken asylum system and we need to treat people like human beings by fixing our legal immigration system.MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have an opening to do any of that, though?REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I -MARGARET BRENNAN: The two of you together?REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I - I was working on this before I became the co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus for about a year with a guy named Morgan Lutrell (ph) from Texas, very conservative, former Navy SEAL guy, talking about the details, trying to build a coalition of business, badges and the Bible to work together to support an effort like this.Now Brian and I, as co-chairs of the Problem Solvers Caucus are taking those efforts and others and trying - and we have a working group as well to say, as soon as that opening arises, we're ready to make a deal.MARGARET BRENNAN: I know, but you guys are talking about, you can't even agree to keep the lights on, right?REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: OK, but we -MARGARET BRENNAN: Like, you're talking about really hard, substantive things.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Well, what's going to happen is the - Homeland Security is going to need money.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: They're - they're spending money like crazy and the CR is not going to fix the problem. And at some -MARGARET BRENNAN: That's going to go to reconciliation, party line vote, right?REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: If - you can't fix everything through reconciliation. And you're going to need - and you can't - certainly can't fix asylum and you certainly can't fix the dreamers and a whole bunch of other stuff through reconciliation. There is going to be an opening that's going to come when they need Democratic votes. And my argument to my Democratic colleagues is, we should be looking to finally fix this broken immigration system once and for all. Secure the border, fix asylum, dreamers, farm workers, essential workers and other people that we need to keep our economy open.REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And if I may add, one of the reasons why I'm so excited about Tom being the co-chair is he shares my passion and the passion of so many people about this issue that there is a border security piece and there is an immigration piece. And we're a country of immigrants. All of our families came into this country through other places, Italy, Ireland.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: My father was born in Italy.REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And for Brian (ph) Fitzpatrick, Irish as well.REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And, you know, that's the - that's the huge advantage that we have over our adversaries, is, we have an endless supply of brilliant people coming into this country. Nobody wants to move to Russia or China or North Korea or Iran. Everybody wants to come here. That's a huge economic advantage. It's a huge national security advantage.So, we can combine border security and the rule of law with being - bringing the best and brightest people into this country and also people that are truly fleeing oppression. And that's what America is about.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Margaret, every problem we face in our country is complicated. You know this as well as anybody. Everything's complicated. You can't, why don't you just?MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: There's no, why don't you just anything. Anybody who says that doesn't know what they're talking about.MARGARET BRENNAN: That's an entire political campaign, why don't you just.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Right. Right. Which doesn't make sense.And so what you need is people who may disagree with each other on certain issues -MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Just sit across from each other and say, well, I think this, well I think that, well how about this, well how about that, and you try and find a compromise somewhere in the middle.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Compromise is not a dirty word. And we have got to figure out how to start moving our country forward, not with this all my way or the highway, you guys are no good because you're one of those - no, you're on of those.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: It's not working for our country. People want us to work together to solve problems.MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, Congressman Fitzpatrick, I know you feel very strongly about supporting Ukraine and its fight against Russia. Ben Hodges, who's a retired general who commanded U.S. Army Europe, said he's having a hard time understanding how withholding intelligence, and military support from Ukraine, advances strategic interests or helps make America great.Can you explain that?REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, I will say this, we're going to get a briefing - a full briefing on this, this coming week. But I will say this, key in on what's not being said here. What kind of intelligence and who can't share it, right? So, what I suspect, and I will get confirmation of this next week, is that it's the over the horizon intelligence striking into Russian territory.MARGARET BRENNAN: It's also satellite.REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Possibly. But, second, we -MARGARET BRENNAN: Maxar technologies cannot (INAUDIBLE).REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: We have seamless intelligence sharing with the U.K., to give you one example. There's no restriction on the U.K. sharing that intelligence with Ukraine. So, what I suspect is happening here, and I could be proven wrong, this that this an escalate to de- escalate tactic by the administration to bring these parties to the table and to come to a conclusion, a just conclusion, which means success and victory for Ukraine. And I want to emphasize that. And I get asked, well, what does that mean?MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Vladimir - what victory means for me is Vladimir Putin regrets his decision to invade Ukraine. That he wishes he did not do that. And that's really going to be the test here, right, because if we reward dictators from invading sovereign, freedom-loving democracies, we are sending a message to every other dictator and aspiring dictator across this plant that, if you do do that, you will be rewarded. That cannot be the message coming out of this.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Trump has been wrong in the way he's handled this. I want to give Brian credit as co-chair of the Ukrainian Caucus, for standing up and saying, you cannot reward a dictator. Zelenskyy was elected by 73 percent of the Ukrainian population in a free and fair election as dictated by the European Commission that oversees free and fair elections. Putin is the dictator. Putin invaded. Zelenskyy is democratically elected. We cannot reward the guy responsible for murdering, for kidnapping, for raping, for all the awful things that have happened to the Ukrainian people. We all need to stand up for the Ukrainian people.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know that the secretary of state, the national security adviser and President Trump's envoy are all meeting with Ukrainian officials Tuesday. One of the things that I took note of, Congressman Fitzpatrick, you tweeted that you have an outcome determinative number of members of the U.S. Congress who ready, willing and able to do whatever it takes to prevent Putin from being rewarded. That sounds like you are threatening leverage with votes. How would you use it?REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: It's not - it's not a threat. What this is, is us making very clear that we view this issue to be existential to world peace. These are the lessons of World War II. When we had - when Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and you had leaders, including Neville Chamberlain and many other leaders around the world saying it's not our problem, we don't want to provoke, we don't want to escalate. And a problem that could have been nipped in the bud early, because it was not, turned out to be the costliest and deadliest war in world history where we had to send our young - our youth in our country to fight on Omaha beach. We should never get to that point. We should learn from the lessons of history.These dictators want to relitigate the outcome of World War II. And World War II, freedom won over dictatorship. They want to relitigate that. So, we just have to be mindful of history and how we approach this.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And if Putin gets away with this, just because Ukraine is a smaller country, think about Latvia and Lithuania and Estonia and Moldova and think about Poland.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: They're all next. And we have to stand up against this.REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And Putin has said that. He's telegraphed this punch.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, President Trump says, oh, it's all different when he's in charge.But, Congressman, I need to ask you, before you go, because of the districts and the unique characteristics of it, the one you represent, earlier this week we saw guidance from the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee urging members to hold virtual town halls, suggesting that holding them in person was not a good idea. Will you still hold town halls with your constituents?REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Yes. We - we communicate -MARGARET BRENNAN: Because some have gotten quite heated recently.REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Oh, I know. No, I think every member needs to find the best way to communicate with their constituents. And there's a number of ways to do that. I think what Chairman Hudson is referring to are the - what's turning out to be a circus, a three-ring circus, where you go to a high school gymnasium, the protesters shows up, they hold signs up, and you have legitimate concerns from some other people that are never heard because they're getting shouted down by people that are there to make a spectacle, oftentimes that are funded by some of these dark money groups.So, there's - it's about communicating to your constituents in a way that you can get your message out, that you can hear their concerns. And every single district does it different depending on - on where they're at.MARGARET BRENNAN: You, Congressman Suozzi, during the address to Congress this week, you did see Texas Democrat Congressman Green be disruptive. He was pulled out of the chamber because of that. Later censured with the votes of nine Democrats, including yourself, and 214 Republicans. Why did you take that vote against a fellow Democrat?REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Because if it was a Republican doing the same thing to a Democratic president, I would have voted for that as well. And the bottom line is, it was a strategic mistake on the part - on our behalf as well because instead of talking about Social Security cuts, and talking about Medicaid cuts and talking about Medicare cuts, and talking about the things that the president said in his speech that we disagree with, especially things like Ukraine or firing people in these different departments that makes no sense whatsoever, we, instead, focus too much time on disruptive behavior.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And the conduct of the Democrats. That was a strategic mistake, as well as something that just is not appropriate for the decorum of the U.S. House of Representatives.MARGARET BRENNAN: Was - was that message from Democratic leadership not clear then?REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I think that it was pretty clear. I understood a clear message.MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Let's not make the story about us, let's make the story about what President Trump says and how we disagree with it.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: And we squandered that opportunity.MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, thank you, gentlemen -REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Thank you.MARGARET BRENNAN: For doing this in a bipartisan fashion as well.REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN FITZPATRICK: You bet.MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: Russia stepped up its aerial attacks on Ukraine following the Trump administration's suspension of intelligence sharing and military equipment. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Moscow has carried out hundreds of attacks using ballistic missiles and drones.For more now, we're joined by Fiona Hill. She is a senior fellow at Brookings and during the first Trump administration she was the senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council.Good to have you back.FIONA HILL (Senior Fellow, Brookings and Fromer National Security Council Senior Director for European and Russian Affairs): Yes, thanks, Margaret.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the U.S. pauses of lethal intelligence sharing, including targeting data for U.S.-provided weapons like HIMARS. We also know it extends to satellite imagery, which is no longer being shared with Ukraine.What's the practical impact of that and the military freeze?FIONA HILL: Well, I think we can see the impact. It's certainly, on the one hand, emboldened Russia to really step up the attacks, and it's also not just blindsided but also partially blinded Ukraine. I mean, we heard from the previous segment that there's still some sharing with allies, like the United Kingdom, of course, which is part of the Five Eyes sharing with the United States. But frankly, none of the other allies, including the U.K., have the same access to satellite imagery as the United States does. So, even if there is, you know, some sharing, not much restrictions, there certainly has an impact.And, frankly, I think it's going to be an impetus to other allies to start stepping up their own capabilities and questioning themselves about the virtues of sharing with the United States. I mean, this is a two-way street. We have to remember that other countries also share pretty vital information with the United States, even if the scale is not quite the same.MARGARET BRENNAN: Canada, the U.K., Australia, among those who do so. You think they will essentially punish the U.S. by not sharing intelligence freely?FIONA HILL: I'm not sure whether it's punishment, but it will be a lot of questioning about what actually happens with this. Because if you're bundling together intelligence, then effectively the United States is putting restrictions on that. Was that pre-discussed with our five eyes allies, for example, or with other allies, particularly in the midst of basically a conflict that is, as we've heard, you know, over and over again, the largest land war in Europe since World War II. I mean, this is really unprecedented in terms of the actions of the United States in this regard because he's not just affecting Ukraine, again, it's having knock-on effects for all of our other allies who are directly affected, all of our European allies that are directly affected by this conflict.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump said on Friday when he was asked if this uptick in Putin's bombing was directly related to the U.S. halt. Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I actually think he's doing what anybody else would do. I think he's - I think he wants to get it stopped and settled, and I think he's hitting them harder than - than he's been hitting them. And I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)MARGARET BRENNAN: Yet earlier in the day, the president had posted on social media he was considering possibly putting sanctions on Russia. That's a contradiction. What do you make of what he said?FIONA HILL: I make of it exactly what he said. I mean, he's actually, obviously, putting himself in the shoes of Vladimir Putin and saying that if I were the aggressor, that's exactly what I would be doing if I wanted to make Ukraine capitulate. So, I mean, yes, he called it as it is. I don't believe what he said for a second about the sanctions. I believe more what he just said there in the Oval Office, sitting behind, you know, the Resolute Desk. I mean,n I think that's what you can take away from this. He accurately -MARGARET BRENNAN: Believe the president and when he says things?FIONA HILL: That's - I think you should. Yes. I mean, he's the president of the United States. And he made it crystal clear, I think. And he sees, you know, obviously, the Ukraine - the Ukrainians, and he said that in the Oval Office during the meeting with President Zelenskyy, that he sees them on the back foot as losing, and he's basically telling them that they have to capitulate. Very clear.MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't have the cards was the line. He kept using that.FIONA HILL: That's right.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know you were at the Council on Foreign Relations this week, as was I. I had an interview with Trump's envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg. And when we were discussing the president's decision to cut off Ukraine, he said, Ukrainians brought it on themselves, and the decision was, like, quote, \"hitting a mule with a two by four across the nose, you got their attention.\"It's quite a statement, comparing our ally to a farm animal here that needed to be beaten. Do you think it was right to say the Ukrainian government, though, was just not getting it?FIONA HILL: Well, what they weren't getting is really what President Trump wanted directly from them, which was obviously to have President Zelenskyy make a personal agreement with him in the Oval Office in front of all the cameras to thank him profusely for all the aid that was already provided to Ukraine over, you know, successive administrations now, and basically to sign a deal on rare earths minerals and then basically leave immediately after that. And clearly, President Zelenskyy didn't really get that message.And I think there's a very important element here. In diplomacy, you really should not only be speaking in your native language. And I think that a lot of this was lost in translation. First of all, President Zelenskyy didn't fully understand that this agreement was just purely with President Trump. And you may remember, if we all go back and watch that - I watched it many times just to try to figure out exactly where things had gone wrong, and there were multiple points. But there's one point when President Zelenskyy basically said, look, you know, we had deals with your - your previous presidents, basically with Obama and Biden. And President Trump immediately dismissed all of that and basically said those deals were not worth the paper they were written on, or the commitments that were made because they were weak and it wasn't me.MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it was not me.FIONA HILL: And President Zelenskyy didn't quite follow all of this because, like the rest of our allies, he actually thinks that commitments made by the United States are supposed to hold over successive administrations. And what we learned there, what he learned there, was that is not the case. You're essentially going to have to make a new commitment with President Trump. It's a personal commitment. And that was what he was being told, and he didn't fully understand.And I think in the future, when the Ukrainians are meeting with the Americans, they ought to have translators with them because as good as President Zelenskyy's English is, there's two things that he's missing there. He doesn't quite understand the way that President Trump operates -MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.FIONA HILL: Although I think he's probably got the message now, but he doesn't always understand the nuances. And I would also think that our side on the United States side could do with some interpretation as well, coming also from President Zelenskyy.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.FIONA HILL: So, my advice to President Zelenskyy and to the team around President Trump is, use interpreters, that's what they're there for.MARGARET BRENNAN: And your own government's interpreters?FIONA HILL: That's absolutely right, your own government's interpreters, no (ph), because you actually asked that question, who's interpreters were used and General Kellogg couldn't answer the question.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, for Steve Witkoff, who met with Putin for three and a half hours.FIONA HILL: Correct.MARGARET BRENNAN: Europe seems to be taking these threats seriously and looking at an alternative to the American nuclear deterrent. An umbrella. That's - does that mean the transatlantic alliance is gone?FIONA HILL: Well, it doesn't mean that it's gone, but there's a bit of a kind of a one-sided attempt to rupture it here on the part of the United States.I was also at the Munich Security Conference. I heard Vice President Vance's speech. I was standing next to a couple of very prominent Europeans who were completely in shock.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.FIONA HILL: And immediately after that, as you well know, there were many statements coming out of Germany, as well as countries like Sweden, basically asking whether the United States could be trusted on nuclear weapons.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.FIONA HILL: But we have to remember that Ukraine had nuclear weapons that it gave.MARGARET BRENNAN: And they gave them up.FIONA HILL: That's correct.MARGARET BRENNAN: With the promise of a security guarantee that was not delivered on.FIONA HILL: Correct.MARGARET BRENNAN: Fiona Hill, thank you.We'll be back.FIONA HILL: Thanks.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for today. Thank you for watching. Until next week.

Here’s why","text":"It has now been more than three months since Donald Trump was elected the 47th president of the United States last November with a resounding victory over the sitting vice president, Kamala Harris.\n\nA presidential election in the US is not a national referendum as much as it is 51 individual contests. Each state — plus the District of Columbia — has a proportional voice, based on population, in choosing the president. Candidates must win individual states. Some states nearly always vote for the Democratic candidate. Others are reliably Republican. Certain states, however, are less predictable and as such are referred to as swing states and usually have a significant impact on the final outcome.\n\nPresident Trump won all seven 2024 swing states, turned a couple of blue (Democrat) states to red, and overwhelmingly won. He became only the second man in the nation’s history to win non-consecutive terms in the highest office in the land.\n\nTrump achieved this despite a variety of court cases in multiple jurisdictions, an extraordinarily hostile media and a would-be assassin’s bullet on his way back to the White House. Trump’s poll numbers in the first weeks after being sworn in on January 20 were the highest they have ever been.\n\nThe international media were flummoxed. How did this brash, rude, overbearing man convince more than 77 million Americans to vote for him? The answer is much simpler than it may seem.\n\nDuring the 2024 election cycle, poll after poll showed the same issues were of the greatest concern to the American public. In each of those priority topics, the public gave the Biden/Harris administration a failing grade. In some of the issues, Trump had clearly enjoyed more success in his previous four years in charge than the Democratic team had.\n\nThe top priority by far for most Americans was the economy. Hurt by President Joe Biden’s policies and limited diplomatic abilities, Americans suffered high inflation and rising interest rates. The price of petrol skyrocketed under Biden. Since trucks use fuel, the cost of everything trucks delivered, such as groceries or pharmaceuticals, jumped as well.\n\nBasic food items, such as eggs, doubled in price. When feeding your family, buying medication and filling the fuel tank in the car become difficult for families, it is only natural to seek change. When interest rates are too high for a young family to buy a home, those families long for something different. Trump, whose economic track record as president, on several indicators, was considerably better than Biden’s until COVID-19 struck, promised that change.\n\nThe second priority for Americans in virtually every poll was the open border with Mexico. On his very first day in office, Biden cancelled a number of border policies and projects that had been put in place by Trump during his first term. The result was disastrous. Harris was announced as the “border tsar”, but she did not even visit the border until she became her party’s presidential candidate nearly four years later. Biden himself literally shrugged his shoulders and said, “We’re doing all we can.”\n\nAccording to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), in April 2020, while Trump was still in his first term, there were just more than 16,000 illegal border crossings. In 2022, just a year into the Biden presidency, monthly numbers were consistently exceeding 200,000 — April saw agents apprehend 235,000 individuals attempting to cross the border illegally. The worst was in December 2023 when, according to CBP, 250,000 people crossed the border illegally in one month.\n\nContrast that with the first full month under Trump 2.0. CBP recorded 8,450 apprehensions of migrants who crossed into the country unlawfully between official entry points along the US-Mexico border. That is the lowest number since statistics have been maintained, and is a 97 percent drop from the peak of 250,000. That is the very definition of success. It is clear that simply enforcing the existing laws on the books and freeing border patrol agents to do their job is working.\n\nA third item that was prominent in the minds of many Americans in 2024 was the war in Gaza. Ahead of the election, Trump spoke of the importance of peace in the region. He promised that, if elected, a ceasefire would be in place even before he was officially sworn in.\n\nBiden had virtually no diplomatic relationship with the Arab community, and the Netanyahu administration detested Biden, whose campaign team had been dispatched to Israel in previous years in an effort to defeat Netanyahu. In short, Biden had no leverage with either side in the conflict.\n\nAfter winning the election, Trump made Gaza a top priority. He assigned a team, headed by Steve Witkoff, to work with Egypt and Qatar on terms for a ceasefire. Witkoff earned the praise of all parties to the negotiations and helped to successfully bring about a ceasefire in a matter of weeks. Nothing is simple between Israel and the Arab world, but for the first time in 15 months, people stopped dying. Trump had made good on his promise.\n\nTrump has been back in the White House for only a few weeks but has already fulfilled some major promises and is taking action on others.\n\nWhile Gaza’s future remains uncertain, a ceasefire still holds.\n\nThe US border is more secure than it has ever been.\n\nTrump’s energy and environmental policies are expected to have a net positive effect on the US and global economies within a matter of months. Lower prices and more stability are anticipated.\n\nThe Trump team has set its sights on a number of other challenges as well – peace in Ukraine; rescuing astronauts stuck at the International Space Station; and shrinking the size of government through cutting waste, fraud and abuse. Each of these is difficult, even for Trump’s greatest detractors, to argue with. Does anyone want more war between Russia and Ukraine? Does anyone think government waste and corruption should be encouraged? Of course not.\n\nA segment of Americans and certainly some global citizens as well, are aghast at the abrupt, boisterous way in which Trump conducts himself. If they take the time to look past the bluster, however, and subjectively assess the results — such as peace, security, stability and prosperity — they will realise that the US, and indeed the world, need Trump at this moment in time.","summary":"He&#039;s brash and unconventional.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., went on camera to offer his assessment.\n\n\"I was horrified and sickened,\" Schiff said. \"This is Donald Trump caring about nothing of American values,\" he later added.\n\nMore than 2.2 million people watched Schiff. But he wasn't talking on MSNBC or on CNN. Instead, he was appearing on the YouTube channel of the MeidasTouch Network, an upstart online media company known for its relentless critiques of Trump, delivered in a blizzard of bare-bones, outrage-heavy videos, clips, podcasts and social media posts.\n\nMeidasTouch is a leader among the numerous digital-first outlets that have been rapidly reshaping the progressive media landscape since Trump took office. Tapping into agita among progressives about the new administration's policies, they are fast becoming power brokers in Democratic politics and -- party faithful hope -- finally replicating the influential media ecosystem that Republicans have built over the past decade.\n\n\"Pod Save America,\" the podcast hosted by former operatives of President Barack Obama, for example, has clocked a 70% increase in hours played since mid-January. And the number of subscribers to the YouTube channel for \"The Young Turks,\" a left-wing news show that streams live five days a week, jumped 208% last month.\n\nBut perhaps no metric underscores the new attention to progressive media more than last month's revelation that \"The MeidasTouch Podcast\" had usurped Joe Rogan's show atop both Apple's and Spotify's rankings for downloads, a slot the show held for two weeks. (Rogan reclaimed the top spot this past week.)\n\n\"We're providing a comforting place where we're channeling people's feelings during a real difficult time,\" said Ben Meiselas, a lawyer who founded MeidasTouch with his two brothers as a political action committee in 2020 before converting it into a media business three years ago.\n\nFor its devoted fans, who call themselves the Meidas Mighty, MeidasTouch presents an alternate reality in which Democrats are ascendant and Trump and Republicans are in a state of collapse. Titles of recent podcast episodes, which are also streamed on YouTube, include \"Trump in Panic After Caving Like a Coward,\" \"Trump Crumbles in Public as His Entire Life Unravels\" and \"Democratic Leaders Destroy Trump in Red Districts.\"\n\nToday, MeidasTouch has 12 full-time employees and 30 regular contributors, including former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, and 4.3 million subscribers on YouTube. When it comes to setting the agenda for Democratic discourse, Meiselas said, \"I think digital is far more significant and important than TV now.\"\n\nOf course, television is far from dead. But center and left-leaning networks have steadily lost ground to Fox News, the runaway leader in ratings among cable news networks. Last month, Fox aired every one of the 10 top-rated shows on cable news.\n\nThat has pushed increasing numbers of Democratic politicians to turn to digital media in search of larger and younger audiences.\n\n\"We were getting shellacked in new media,\" said Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who leads the Senate Democratic Strategic Communications Committee. Democrats, in particular former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, have been roundly criticized for their reluctant approach to nontraditional outlets, which contrasted with Trump's enthusiastic embrace of right-wing influencers and podcasts.\n\nIn January, Booker's committee and its House counterpart posted job openings for social media managers to help forge relationships with digital creators. Booker has also invited influencers such as Brian Tyler Cohen, a popular YouTube host who said he has gained 250,000 subscriptions to his YouTube page in the past two weeks, to run digital media training for Democrats. They're taught how to record their own videos, use better lighting and microphones and stop worrying about swearing on camera.\n\nCohen, a former MSNBC contributor who has 3.9 million subscribers and also pumps out content on TikTok, Instagram and X, described the shift online as \"existential\" for Democrats and one that had been long in coming.\n\n\"I couldn't get anyone to do my show before,\" he said. \"Now I have to juggle all the requests from A-listers who want to come on.\"\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nSome politicians are jumping directly into the fray. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California last week started a podcast that features interviews with what he called \"some of the biggest leaders and architects in the MAGA movement.\" In his opening interview with Charlie Kirk, a founder of the pro-Trump organization Turning Point USA, Newsom said he'd like to emulate the frenetic, and constantly on-message, vibe of right-wing media.\n\nThat might prove harder than it sounds. Podcasts hosted by other Democrats -- such as \"Inside Maine With Senator Angus King\" -- have failed to attract large audiences. Other attempts to be digital forward have looked more like face-plants. Last week, for example, Booker and more than a dozen other senators were criticized for posting nearly identical responses to Trump's speech to Congress. Booker later acknowledged writing the script that he and his colleagues had read.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nOn the web, a podcast appearance can be watched live, downloaded to be seen later, posted on multiple platforms and cut into segments that can live on for hours or even days, creating exponentially more opportunities for engagement.\n\nAfter Trump's speech to Congress on Tuesday, Adam Mockler, MeidasTouch's in-house Gen-Z influencer, generated more than 250,000 views livestreaming reactions from Democrats, including Rep. Eric Swalwell of California and Ken Martin, the new chair of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThen Acyn Torabi, a MeidasTouch employee who specializes in spotting potentially viral content and cutting it into traffic-generating short clips, posted excerpts from those interviews on X, racking up nearly 1 million more views.\n\nMeiselas and his brothers, Brett and Jordy, post a dozen or more 10- to 20-minute-long news segments -- nearly all featuring the search-engine-optimizing word \"Trump\" in their title -- on YouTube every day. That torrent is supplemented by other shows produced by MeidasTouch contributors.\n\nThat constant stream of bite-size content gives listeners more episodes to download, helping to lift the outlet's ranking on podcast charts. In February, MeidasTouch had 57.5 million podcast downloads, according to Podscribe, a tracker, ranking it ahead of \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" and Candace Owens' podcast, even though they had significantly more listeners per episode.\n\n\"You have to move fast,\" said Ron Filipkowski, a former Republican with nearly 1 million followers on X who was hired in 2023 to edit the MeidasTouch website. In September, he helped start the company's newsletter on Substack; it has grown to more than 500,000 subscribers, some 40,000 of whom pay at least $8 a month to get ad-free and exclusive content. He also records a weekly podcast of his own, \"Uncovered,\" which focuses on right-wing misinformation.\n\n\"A lot of what we do no one else does, and that's why our following has grown,\" Filipkowski said.\n\nOther outlets are adapting to keep up. Tommy Vietor, a co-host of \"Pod Save America,\" which is known for in-depth, and often quite lengthy, interviews with Democratic insiders, said he had lately been experimenting with short-form videos that he uploaded directly to TikTok.\n\n\"Trump is the most relentless communicator in the history of politics, and he has the biggest platform,\" Vietor said. \"So the only way Democrats can begin to compete with that is by communicating constantly, everywhere, all the time.\"\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nDespite the recent successes, the left does not yet have a true analog to the loudest right-wing voices like Elon Musk and Ben Shapiro.\n\nMelissa Kiesche, a senior vice president at Edison Research, which ranks podcasts, said that while reaching the top spot on Apple and Spotify was a laudable achievement, MeidasTouch's total reach was still miles behind Rogan's. She noted, for example, that he has roughly five times as many subscribers on YouTube as MeidasTouch.\n\n\"Nothing even comes close,\" Kiesche said.\n\nLast week, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., invited Carlos Eduardo Espina, a left-wing influencer who delivers news updates in Spanish and has 12.3 million followers on TikTok, to be his guest for Trump's speech to Congress and to post videos commenting on the event. The 11 videos Espina uploaded to the site about the event have racked up more than 17 million views.\n\nBut Khanna argues that until more members of his party begin to see social media influencers as an integral part of the movement, it will be impossible to catch up.\n\n\"I think the right has really created a space in the digital world where people feel they're part of a community,\" he said. \"And the left has not done that.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"Soon after the recent contentious Oval Office meeting between President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, Sen.

Wes Moore of Maryland, still bitter that the Baltimore Ravens quarterback had fallen just short of winning the NFL's MVP award.\n\n\"The Sixers suck right now,\" declared Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, lamenting the decline of Philadelphia's basketball team.\n\nThe hot takes are flowing as a parade of ambitious Democrats talk sports, trying to accentuate their salt-of-the-earth credentials and forge stronger bonds with voters.\n\nThese Democrats are flocking to sports radio shows and podcasts as their party tries to correct for what it widely takes as an article of faith: that President Donald Trump won back power with help from young men who found themselves drawn to him through what was once an apolitical sphere of the media.\n\nAs their party reels from the impact of Trump's policies and struggles to craft a new strategy and message, Democrats have found that yakking about sports is perhaps the easiest way to reach skeptical or disengaged audiences who might not otherwise want to spend time listening to a politician.\n\nMoore is a regular caller on Baltimore and Washington sports radio, where last fall he predicted football winners on Friday afternoons. Lately, he has had a lot of thoughts about where a proposed new Washington Commanders stadium should go. (Maryland, obviously.)\n\nShapiro served as a game analyst for a University of Pittsburgh basketball broadcast last month. And Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky is already preparing to do the rounds of podcasts and shows at the Kentucky Derby this spring.\n\nVoters, Beshear said, want \"candidates and people serving who don't just sound like normal human beings, but they are normal human beings.\"\n\n\"Talking about sports, going to watch sports and talking to people as you meet them about sports, just shows that you, too, are a normal human being,\" he said.\n\nThese Democratic governors are broadening their outreach to voters at a political moment when Trump showed up at the Super Bowl and the Daytona 500 and is considering a posthumous pardon for Pete Rose, the baseball legend barred for betting on games.\n\n\"It takes the politics out of it,\" said Walz, whose career as a high school football coach was often highlighted after he became the Democratic nominee for vice president last year. \"When I go out there and go on those shows, it shows you're a real human being and it connects with people on something they care about.\"\n\nCertainly, Americans have long mixed sports and politics, and many of these Democrats were talking sports well before the last election. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, who once aspired to be a sports broadcaster, appeared on the \"Locked on Lions\" podcast last spring to talk about the NFL draft, which was held in Detroit.\n\nBut the postelection appearances have been especially striking, particularly because former Vice President Kamala Harris appeared on only a few sports shows during the fall campaign.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nThe Harris campaign tried but failed to have her appear on popular podcasts hosted by sports commentator Bill Simmons and the Kelce brothers of professional football, according to a person who sought to arrange her media interviews. (The campaign also failed in its efforts to book her with podcaster Joe Rogan and the \"Hot Ones\" YouTube show, which interviews celebrities as they eat blisteringly spicy chicken wings.)\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nIn recent weeks, Democrats including Shapiro; Moore; Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader; former Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, who resigned in scandal and is now running for mayor of New York City; and Rep. Ro Khanna of California have made time to chat with Stephen A. Smith, the ESPN personality. Smith, for his part, has espoused so many thoughts on politics lately that his name has begun to show up in fantasy 2028 Democratic presidential primary polling.\n\nSmith, who agreed last week to a $100 million contract that allows him to delve more into politics, conferred instant sports credibility to Shapiro, seeming to compare him to basketball superstar Michael Jordan. Smith also said he would be willing to campaign for Moore.\n\nFor his part, Shapiro, who spoke with Smith before the Super Bowl, correctly predicted that his hometown Philadelphia Eagles would be able to contain Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n\nAnd though Shapiro reveled in the Eagles' Super Bowl victory, his true sports passion is basketball. During a recent interview, he spoke at length about the aging and oft-injured roster of the Philadelphia 76ers, a team he said had failed to adapt to modern basketball.\n\n\"Teams that are trying to win with like a Big Two or Big Three, as the Sixers attempted to do, aren't having as much success in the league right now,\" Shapiro said. \"That's compounded when you have injuries that they do. It's really troubling.\"\n\nShapiro's unsparing analysis of his 76ers would not be out of line on Philadelphia sports radio -- to which he has been known to call in as \"Josh in Abington,\" a reference to his hometown north of the city.\n\nSpeaking hard truths about hometown teams -- and where one's loyalties lie -- is a vehicle for politicians to convey authenticity.\n\n\"It's very important for politicians -- especially Democrats, if they want to try to reach the sports radio audience -- they got to be who they are,\" said Matt Jones, a prominent sports radio host in Kentucky who considered, but then decided against, a 2020 challenge to Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former Republican leader. \"In the sports world, people don't like fakes. They're fine with you not rooting for their team, but you better not lie about who you root for.\"\n\nIndeed, sports bigamy can exacerbate a politician's image as a flip-flopper -- or worse, as someone willing to say whatever is expedient. Just ask Hillary Clinton, who at different times in her political life claimed to be a fan of both the Chicago Cubs and the New York Yankees.\n\nHolding true to one's sports loyalties can also backfire. Bill de Blasio never gave up his Boston Red Sox allegiance, which became a problem when he was mayor of New York. Chris Christie used to sit in the Dallas Cowboys owner's box and cheer against the New York Giants and the Eagles -- teams with huge followings in New Jersey, where he was governor.\n\nMoore presents himself as Maryland's No. 1 fan of the Baltimore Ravens and the Baltimore Orioles. But he is also upfront about being a convert. He spent part of his childhood in the Bronx during the New York Mets' glory years in the 1980s. In a 1996 interview with The New York Times, Moore said he dreamed of being drafted into the NBA by the New York Knicks.\n\nIn a recent interview, Moore said he had given up most of his New York sports allegiances -- except for the Knicks.\n\n\"The Mets are still kind of like, you know, your ex-girlfriend, who you're like, 'Yeah, that was fun back in the day,' but there is no doubt that I'm married to the Orioles,\" Moore said.\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nHe also delivered a monologue lasting 1 minute 33 seconds about why Jackson should have been named the NFL's MVP last year over Josh Allen, the Buffalo Bills quarterback.\n\nBut that argument is rejected by another prominent Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul of New York, according to her spokesperson.\n\nHochul, a Buffalo native and a Bills fanatic, did her own round of sports podcast appearances during her team's playoff run in January.\n\n\"You don't have to say, 'Hi' or 'Goodbye,'\" she told \"The Buffalo Football Podcast.\" \"You just have to say, 'Go Bills.'\"\n\nIn states without professional teams, governors tend to focus on college athletics. Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut called the current men's basketball team at the University of Connecticut \"erratic\" but praised its women's team as being \"on fire.\"\n\nAnd in Kentucky, Beshear, a Vanderbilt University alumnus, backs both the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville teams, despite their longstanding and intense basketball rivalry.\n\n\"As governor, you have two jobs when it comes to collegiate basketball,\" he said. \"No. 1, to root for your in-state schools, and No. 2, to root against Duke.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"\"I hate the Packers,\" Gov.

It is well worth watching the whole speech. Clocking in at one hour and forty minutes, Trump’s address was unusually long, the longest of its kind in American history, according to some observers. \n\nTrump claims to have been extraordinarily dynamic during his first weeks in office, and that claim is true: As a rough indicator, “in an explosion of executive action,” the total of his “executive orders, memoranda, and substantial declarations” issued – a metric applied by the American Presidency Project at the University of California – has far outpaced the early-term output not only of his immediate forerunner Joe Biden, but also such giants as Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower, not to speak of Trump in his own first term. In fact, Trump 2.0 has produced already “more presidential directives than almost all recent presidents” in their full first 100 days, that is, more than double the time Trump had been in office again.\n\nThe 100-day standard – or now even less maybe – for measuring presidential performance is, of course, arbitrary, a product, originally, of FDR’s savvy propaganda tactics that never went away again, and it may even be “ridiculous.” But it is part of US political culture such as it is, and Trump is fully aware of the sheer political shock-and-awe effect of his Battle-of-the-Somme-like opening barrage, or, as US commentators put it with the inevitable sports metaphor, of “flooding the zone.”\n\nNumbers, in any case, are not everything: The substance of Trump’s first salvo is at least as impressive – for better or worse, that’s another question – as the bare figures. Highlights include: Starting a détente with Russia and a great American-European split, both long overdue. The dismantling – de facto, at least – of NATO has begun was well. And good riddance to that Cold War zombie, too: Say hello to the Warsaw Pact when you meet in history dustbin hell. Then there also are a few trade wars that have shaken the stock markets globally.\n\nMeanwhile, a blitzkrieg in the great American culture wars over pronouns, bathrooms, and genital modification has pummeled everything that US conservatives consider “woke”: from gender definitions (from now on only two, can you imagine?) to no longer letting biologically male athletes beat up women or allowing adults to rely on children’s “own” “judgement” when it comes to doing away with their sex organs.\n\nAnd yes, Mexico has lost its Gulf – as far as Americans are concerned, anyhow; Panama may well lose its canal; Denmark – Greenland (“one way or the other,” in Trumpese) and Canada – Canada.\n\nSay what you will about Trumpism, but it sure as hell is not lazy. That was also one of Trump’s key messages during his address to Congress. It is no surprise, but let’s state it for the record: Trump still has a huge ego – if anything, even bigger now, after his come-back triumph and dodging that assassin’s bullet in Butler, Pennsylvania – and, of course, he spent a lot of time on praising himself and his team, with special accolades to first buddy Elon Musk. So what? It will rile up Trump’s opponents and critics (which the Trumpists greatly enjoy); his voters and fans will love it.\n\nThe same is true for Trump’s extensive and very deft use of the “human touch” or “showmanship” – call it what you will – highlighting individual citizens and their losses or challenges and offering them solace and recognition: A young boy suffering from cancer who admires the police was made an honorary Secret Service agent. A woman athlete permanently injured by a very misplaced man got a shout-out when Trump spoke of banning male athletes from women’s sports. The bereaved family members of crime victims received various acknowledgments.\n\nNone of the above was innocent, of course; everything was political. The crimes selected for mention featured illegal immigrants. An officer singled out for his bravery had saved a colleague in a fire fight with a gang from across the Rio Grande. Trump used his kindness toward the boy struggling with cancer to claim that his administration is fighting toxins in the environment. With his pronounced activism against environmental standards, the opposite is true, unfortunately. But you get the gist.\n\nYet there are two mistakes that casual or angry observers are prone to make and they should better avoid: Yes, Trump is a politician – and a much more gifted one than we knew – and his relationship with the truth is very complicated, to put it politely. But that does not make him exceptional: neither the substance nor the scope of his distortions and outright untruths exceed those of, for instance, the late Biden administration which was brazenly lying about Israel’s Gaza Genocide in a truly Orwellian register – as, by the way, are their Trumpist successors, too. Witness Trump’s bizarre claim that he has struck down “censorship,” while, in reality, his administration is suppressing solidarity with Palestine even worse than their predecessors.\n\nSecondly, the fact that Trump bends and breaks the truth does not mean that he does not believe in anything. This is a key fact: Trump, like quite a few other major political leaders in history and at present, has both a tactical relationship with reality and sincerely-held beliefs, even a sense of justice (usually aggrieved), some of it on display during the “human touch” moments of his speech. That is a powerful element of the charisma he has in spades and that has allowed him to not only win elections but re-center US politics.\n\nHence, you may agree with or you may oppose, even detest, Trump’s convictions. But critics and opponents who deny their existence or underestimate their effects simply because they are neither pure nor free of hypocrisy, will only have themselves to blame when the real world escapes the narrow limits of their imagination, again. \n\nApart from the self-praise, there were other things about Trump’s speech that were less than surprising. As some commentators have pointed out, the address was generally thin on sensational revelations and announcements. (Going to Mars? Come on, we’ve all seen that one coming, from light years off.)\n\nAnd, equally expectably, some of Trump’s statements were at least hyperbolic. New York Times “fact-checkers” who somehow hardly ever check Israeli non-facts, for instance, got busy pointing out that “Trump overstated […] fraud uncovered by” Musk’s DOGE outfit, “misled about energy and environmental policy” and “justified sweeping tariffs with hyperbolic claims about world trade, among other statements.” All true enough, but frankly, a bit of a yawn, too. US politics – and not only, is such a bipartisan orgy of lying, that it is hard to get excited about journalists picking on one side.\n\nNo, the really interesting – and it was very interesting – side of Trump’s speech was not what exactly he had to say or the tired old game of him tweaking reality and his opponents pretending he’s the only one (that is why Democrats holding up little signs reading “false” looked so sad and daft). What was truly intriguing is what Trump told us about himself, and in particular about himself at this stage of his life and career.\n\nRight from the get-go, there was Trump the Unforgiving, even Vengeful. If anyone had expected the usual pretend offer of bipartisanship to the defeated – here, the Democrats – what they got was more like Joe Pesci in one of his many roles as a mafia loose cannon stomping his already dazed opponent into the ground.\n\nBiden, Trump let it rip, is “the worst president in American history.” And although that is probably true, it was a tad brutal to rub it in on this occasion. Senator Liz Warren, who boosted her career by claiming a fraction of native-American “blood” (yes, the US is weird that way), got her usual “Pocahontas” snub, and, in general, Trump taunted and teased the losers. It was not pretty, but it was funny and richly deserved.\n\nThen, there was – perhaps all too easily overlooked – Trump the Fit and Focused. This was not rambling Trump, and even his ad-libbing, while harsh, went well and was clearly under control. From a rhetorical point of view: Take a step back from whether you like his style, and you’ll have to admit, this was a powerful, effective, well-organized, and well-delivered speech. Long gone seem the days of Kamala Harris’s word salads and Joe Biden’s senescent mumblings. Trump may be not so much younger than his predecessor. Yet this speech showed that anyone betting on him declining soon, mentally or physically, is likely to lose. That, in and of itself, is an important fact.\n\nTrump the Showman and Trump the Sincere, namely Sincere Nationalist, we have already discussed above. But regarding that nationalism – or patriotism, if you wish – there is one final aspect of Trump we should note. Especially because it could make him fail, even on his own terms. That is Trump the Utopian.\n\nTrump the Utopian may be a disconcerting phrase for some. Are utopians not supposed to be slightly other-worldly, more or less leftish, probably overly literate types that tend to either not get very far in life or, if they do, mess things up really badly? A personality type somewhere between Campanella (two years of house arrest and then another 27 in prison) and Robespierre (the guillotine, but only after sending plenty of others there)?\n\nAnd yet, there he was, the business tycoon and political brass-knuckle fighter, announcing the beginning of America’s “Golden Age” to be ushered in by his very own flavor of revolution, namely a “revolution of common sense.” Trump promised to pursue “the righteous cause of American liberty” to bring about “the most thrilling days in the history of our country” and its “greatest era,” with “the highest quality of life” and the “safest and wealthiest and healthiest and most vital communities anywhere in the world.” And in the end, that fantasy US, will be, he announced, “the freest, most advanced, most dynamic and most dominant civilization ever to exist on the face of this Earth.”\n\nTypical Trump bombast, you may say. The signature style of a man who has the special skill of sounding too loud even by the standards of American political culture. Or is it just hyperbole for the plebs, perhaps even with a view to already preparing a play for a third term?\n\nBut what if we take Trump’s utopianism seriously? I believe we should, if only because behind all the pomposity and rhetorical overkill, it is easy to miss what may be the single greatest weakness of Trumpism.\n\nConsider again that last line: “the freest, most advanced, most dynamic and most dominant civilization.” Even within the mindset of relentless bragging, choices still have to be made what exactly to brag about. And there it is, next to the freedom, the progress, and the dynamism: Dominance. Not just any dominance, but the greatest dominance ever, whether past or future.\n\nTrump is still failing to see a very simple fact: if there is a way to make America great again, then only by letting go of the clinically insane idea that it must “dominate.” Despite its enormous problems, which Trump may diminish or make worse, the US still has much demographic, economic, and innovative potential.\n\nBut its senseless dream of dominance will always overstretch its resources. America can, perhaps, be great, but only with and no longer against other major powers and, in general, the rest of humanity. And the US will be stuck in useless, wasteful conflict with everyone as long as it does not deliberately abandon its pursuit of dominating everyone. Because guess what Americans: Everybody wants to be free, not only you. You want a “revolution of common sense”? Dominance is the first thing that needs to go.","summary":"The American president has announced the beginning of a gold age for his nation – but there’s one thing he hasn’t taken into account \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/613938-trump-us-utopia-paradox/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.03/article/67cd878785f540396d6fd3d2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 17:15:45","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.05},{"id":298375358,"title":"Transcript: Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick and Tom Suozzi on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" March 9, 2025","text":"The following is the transcript of an interview with Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Tom Suozzi, Democrat of New York, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 9, 2025.MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We're joined now by the co-chairs of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick represents a district that was narrowly carried by Kamala Harris, and New York Democrat Tom Suozzi represents a district that went for President Trump. So you all have to find the middle and that brings you together and brings you here today. It's good to see, in a bipartisan fashion, this conversation take place. But I want to start with you, Congressman Fitzpatrick, there is this potential government shutdown looming March 14th. Speaker Johnson says there's going to be a vote on Tuesday. Will Republicans be able to pass this on party lines, or do you need Democratic votes? REP. BRIAN FITZPATRICK (R-PA): Well, that remains to be seen. You know, the text was just released yesterday, compliant with the 72-hour rule before a vote. We're still digging through it. Like most bills, there's some good in there. There's some not so good in there. And we got to make an aggregated decision. I will say, you know, Tom and I are friends, we came in together. We obviously co-chair this bipartisan group together. And we do lament the fact of any single party bill- the construct in this country is if you get 218 votes, you get everything, and if you get 217 votes you get nothing. And that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. So the reason that we do what we do is we want two party solutions, including on the CR. So, it remains to be seen whether the votes are there or not, but I think we're really going to be learning over the next 24 hours what's in it and what's not in it. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you haven't decided your vote? REP. FITZPATRICK: Correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: What about you, Congressman Suozzi? Because Leader Jeffries initially said in a letter, Democrats cannot back it. You have the text. Are you a no?REP. TOM SUOZZI (D-NY): Right now, I'm a no. I mean, there's been no outreach on a bipartisan basis. What Brian and I are trying to do in this environment, you can imagine, is not too easy. Everything's very fractured, everything's very divisive, and to overcome that requires trust building and requires people to work together. In the case of the CR there's been offers to negotiate, and there's been very little negotiated. It's kind of been a my way or the highway type of thing. And I think that's going to go on for a while. I think that the leadership is going to try and do my way or the highway for a while, and then at some point they're going to need Democratic votes. And then people start negotiating.MARGARET BRENNAN: A while, meaning we could be staring down to shut down March 14? REP. FITZPATRICK: Well, we'll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday. I believe the government funding runs out at the end of the week. We're scheduled to end votes on Wednesday. Oftentimes, that does not happen during weeks like this, but it's- it's incumbent upon every legislator to read the text and to make an aggregate decision. Does the good outweigh the bad? We never want to shut the government down. That's why I think we need no budget, no pay. If you cut legislators' funding off, if they don't pass a CR or a budget, I think you'll have a much different outcome. So people need to put their money where their mouth is.REP. SUOZZI: Right now, the Republicans are counting on all the Republicans in the House to stick together to pass this through the House with no Democratic votes. That's what they're counting on. That's why they've conducted themselves this way. Then it goes to the Senate. In the Senate, you need 60 votes. You don't have 60 votes with the Senate Republicans. So it's going to become a challenge for the Senate Republicans and the Senate Democrats to decide who's going to get blamed for this thing. And wouldn't it be better if we all just work together to try and find common ground the way- this is not normal what we're doing. The idea of a full year continuing resolution is not the normal process. And there's a lot of bad stuff that I see in this bill that I don't like.REP. FITZPATRICK: And I will add Margaret, I've lived through government shutdowns as an FBI agent, and it's horrific. Title Three wire taps get shut down. Surveillance teams get shut down. It has massive implications that most people don't realize. You never, ever want to shut the government down. It should never happen, and it's a symptom of a broken system that we're even talking about this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me follow up with you on that. You are the only FBI agent who- now turned Congressman. On Monday, the top agent at the New York office, James Dennehy, said he was forced out of his job due to clashes with Justice Department officials over a directive. He had been supportive of Bureau leaders who resisted turning over the names of those agents assigned to carry out investigations related to January 6, 2021. Are you concerned about all this political pressure? REP. FITZPATRICK: I'm very concerned. I'm a huge defender and supporter of the Bureau. It's the best job I ever had in my life, and the most honorable job I've ever had in my life, keeping America safe. And I care very much about the agent population and the professional support staff that work there. They are tremendous people. They are completely nonpartisan. In 14 years in the FBI, I never heard any political talk whatsoever, which is pretty remarkable, so-- MARGARET BRENNAN: -- directly contradicts what the Homeland Security secretary said at the top of this program when she talked- she went at the FBI- the FBI director-- REP. FITZPATRICK: -- Well, there are problems at the top. I want to differentiate. So there have been problems on the seventh floor of the J Edgar Hoover Building that they did politicize things, things like- people like Jim Comey, for example, who tweet out, you know, to vote single party during an election. You can't do that as an FBI director. That's terrible. He did it as a former director, but it undermines everything he did leading up to that point. The FBI needs to be completely non-partisan, completely apolitical. Personally, I think that part of the polygraph testing that comes in- so when you're an agent coming through the process, you get tested on drug history, foreign contacts, financial vulnerabilities. They also ought to test political bias as well, just to give the public the assurance that people are coming into the bureau, checking their politics at the door.REP. TOM SUOZZI: This all comes down to a busting of norms and things that we've been used to for years are all trying to be disrupted. And I think in some ways, very dangerously. We can't see this politicization of the FBI. It's a dangerous thing for our country.MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to talk to the FBI director about any of this? REP. FITZPATRICK: -- Absolutely, absolutely-- MARGARET BRENNAN: -- About the firings of the-- REP. FITZPATRICK: -- Director Patel he worked on our committee. He was a staffer on the House Intelligence Committee, which I sit. And I look forward to having a conversation with him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Suozzi, illegal border crossings, as we just discussed, they are at a historic low. President Trump made that point when he was addressing Congress this week. Was he right that- that he didn't need to wait for Congress, that it was really messaging from the White House beyond? REP. SUOZZI: Well, obviously we've seen a reduction in crossings. We saw it under the end of the Biden administration as well, after he did his executive order to say no asylum applications in between the ports of entry. But we need to make a permanent law, and Congress has not done its job for 30 years. So we need to secure the border. We need to fix the broken asylum system, and we need to treat people like human beings by fixing our legal immigration system. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have an opening to do any of that, though? The two of you together? REP. SUOZZI: I was working on this before I became the co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus for about a year with a guy named Morgan Luttrell from Texas. Very conservative, former Navy SEAL guy, talking about the details, trying to build a coalition of business, badges, and the Bible to work together to support an effort like this. Now, Brian and I, as co-chairs of the Problem Solvers Caucus, are taking those efforts and others and trying- and we have a working group as well to say, as soon as that opening arises, we're ready to make a deal.MARGARET BRENNAN: I know, but you guys are talking about- you can't even agree to keep the lights on, right?-- REP. SUOZZI: -- Okay, but we-- MARGARET BRENNAN:-- you're talking about really hard, substantive thing-- REP. SUOZZI: Well what's going to happen is the Homeland Security is going to need money. They're spending money like crazy, and the CR is not going to fix the problem and-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's going to go to reconciliation, a party line vote, right? REP. SUOZZI: You can't fix everything through reconciliation, and you're going to need- and you can't- certainly can't fix asylum, and you can't- certainly can't fix the Dreamers and a whole bunch of other stuff through reconciliation. There's going to be an opening that's going to come when they need Democratic votes. And my argument to my Democratic colleagues is we should be looking to finally fix this broken immigration system once and for all. Secure the border, fix asylum, Dreamers, farm workers, essential workers and other people that we need to keep our economy open.REP. FITZPATRICK: If I may add, one of the reasons why I'm so excited about Tom being the co-chair is he shares my passion and the passion of so many people about this issue that there is a border security piece and there is an immigration piece. And we're a country of immigrants. All of our families came in to this country through other places, Italy, Ireland-- REP. SUOZZI: -- My father was born in Italy. And for Brennan and Fitzpatrick I got Irish as well.REP. FITZPATRICK : You know, that's the- that's the huge advantage that we have over our adversaries. It's- we have an endless supply of brilliant people coming into this country. Nobody wants to move to Russia or China or North Korea or Iran, everybody wants to come here. That's a huge economic advantage. It's a huge national security advantage. So we can combine border security and the rule of law with being- bringing the best and brightest people into this country, and also people that are truly fleeing oppression. That's what America is about. REP. SUOZZI: Margaret, every problem we face in our country is complicated. You know this as well as anybody, everything's complicated. You can't, why don't you just? There's no why don't you just anything. Anybody who says that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --That's an entire political campaign--REP. SUOZZI: --Right MARGARET BRENNAN: Why don't you justREP. SUOZZI: Which doesn't make sense. And so what you need is people who may disagree with each other on certain issues, to sit across from each other say, well, I think this, well, I think that. Well, how about this? Well, how about that? And you try and find a compromise somewhere in the middle. Compromise is not a dirty word, and we have got to figure out how to start moving our country forward, not with this all my way or the highway. You guys are no good because you're one of those. No you're one of those. That's not working for our country. People want us to work together to solve problems.MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, Congressman Fitzpatrick, I know you feel very strongly about supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Ben Hodges, who's a retired general who commanded US Army Europe, said he's having a hard time understanding how withholding intelligence and military support from Ukraine advances strategic interests or helps make America great. Can you explain that? REP. FITZPATRICK: Well, I will say this. We're going to get a briefing, a full briefing, on this, this coming week, but I will say this key in on what's not being said here, what kind of intelligence and who can't share it, right? So what I suspect, and I will get confirmation of this next week, is that it's the over-the-horizon intelligence striking into Russian territory. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's also satellite. REP. FITZPATRICK: Possibly, but second-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --Maxar technology--REP. FITZPATRICK: We have seamless intelligence sharing with the UK. To give you one example, there's no restriction on the UK sharing that intelligence with Ukraine. So what I suspect is happening here, and I could be proven wrong, is that this is an escalate to de-escalate tactic by the administration, to bring these parties to the table and to come to a conclusion, a just conclusion, which means success and victory for Ukraine. And I want to emphasize that, and I get asked, well, what does that mean? Yep. Vladimir. What victory means for me is Vladimir Putin regrets his decision to invade Ukraine, that he wishes he did not do that, and that's really going to be the test here, right? Because if we reward dictators for invading sovereign, freedom loving democracies, we are sending a message to every other dictator and aspiring dictator across this planet that if you do do that, you will be rewarded. That cannot be the message coming out of this REP. SUOZZI: Trump has been wrong in the way he's handled this. I want to give Brian credit, as co-chair of the Ukrainian caucus, for standing up and saying, you cannot reward a dictator. Zelensky was elected by 73% of the Ukrainian population in a free and fair election that's dictated by the European Commission that oversees free and fair elections. Putin is the dictator. Putin invaded. Zelensky is democratically elected. We cannot reward the guy responsible for murdering, for kidnapping, for raping, for all the awful things that have happened to the Ukrainian people. We all need to stand up for the Ukrainian people. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know that the Secretary of State, the national security adviser and President Trump's envoy are all meeting with Ukrainian officials Tuesday. One of the things that I took note of Congressman Fitzpatrick, you tweeted that you have an outcome determinative number of members of the US Congress who are ready, willing and able to do whatever it takes to prevent Putin from being rewarded. That sounds like you are threatening leverage with votes. How would you use it?REP. FITZPATRICK: It's not a threat. What this is is us making very clear that we view this issue to be existential to world peace. These are the lessons of World War II, when we had- when Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and you had leaders, including Neville Chamberlain and many other leaders around the world, saying it's not our problem. We don't want to provoke. We don't want to escalate, and a problem that could have been could have been nipped in the bud early, because it was not, turned out to be the costliest and deadliest war in world history, where we had to send our young, our youth in our country, to fight on Omaha Beach. We should never get to that point. We should learn from the lessons of history. These dictators want to relitigate the outcome of World War II. In World War II freedom won over dictatorships. They want to relitigate that. So we just have to be mindful of history and how we approach this. REP. SUOZZI: And if Putin gets away with this just because Ukraine is a smaller country, think about Latvia and Lithuania and Estonia and Moldova, and think about Poland, right? They're all next, and we have to stand up against this.REP. FITZPATRICK: And Putin has said that he's telegraphed this punch.MARGARET BRENNAN Right, well, President Trump says that it's all different when he's in charge, but Congressman, I need to ask you before you go because of the district and the unique characteristics of it, the one you represent. Earlier this week, we saw guidance from the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee urging members to hold virtual town halls, suggesting that holding them in person was not a good idea. Will you still hold town halls with your constituents? REP. FITZPATRICK: Yeah, we, we--MARGARET BRENNAN: --Because some of them have gotten quite heated recently.REP. FITZPATRICK: Oh, I know. No. I think every member needs to find the best way to communicate with our constituents, and there's a number of ways to do that. I think what Chairman Hudson is referring to are the what's turning out to be a circus, a three-ring circus, where you go to a high school gymnasium. The protesters show up. They hold signs up, and you have legitimate concerns from some other people that are never heard because they're getting shouted down by people that are there to make a spectacle, oftentimes that are funded by some of these dark money groups. So there's- it's about communicating to your constituents in a way that you can get your message out, that you can hear their concerns. And every single district does it different, depending on- on where they're at. MARGARET BRENNAN: You, Congressman Suozzi, during the address to Congress this week, you did see Texas Democrat Congressman Green be disruptive. He was pulled out of the chamber because of that later censured with the votes of nine Democrats, including yourself, and 214 Republicans. Why did you take that vote against a fellow Democrat? REP. SUOZZI: Because if it was a Republican doing the same thing to a Democratic president, I would have voted for that as well. And the bottom line is it was a strategic mistake on the on our behalf as well. Because instead of talking about Social Security cuts and talking about Medicaid cuts and talking about Medicare cuts and talking about the things that the President said in his speech that we disagree with, especially things like Ukraine or firing people in these different departments that make no sense whatsoever. We instead focus too much time on disruptive behavior and the conduct of the Democrats. That was a strategic mistake, as well as something that just is not appropriate for the decorum of the US House of Representatives--MARGARET BRENNAN: --Was the message from Democratic leadership not clear, then?REP. SUOZZI: --I think that it was pretty clear. I understood a clear message, let's not make the story about us. Let's make the story about what President Trump says and how we disagree with it. And we squandered that opportunity. All right.MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, gentlemen for doing this in a bipartisan fashion as well.","summary":"The following is the transcript of an interview with Reps.

Schiff Deflects When Asked About Men in Women’s Sports","text":"JIMMY KIMMEL: The big question going into this, at least on cable news, was whether the Democrats were going to do anything to disrupt the proceedings. They did. Some of them wore pink clothes which was pretty wild.\n\nSTEPHEN COLBERT: The Democrats came ready to fight back with their little paddles, OK? That is how you save democracy, by quietly dissenting, or bidding on an antique tea set. It was hard to tell what was going on.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJON KARL: Late night's take on the Democratic opposition at Trump's State of the Union address this week.\n\nI'm joined now by Democratic Senator Adam Schiff of California.\n\nSenator, thank you for joining us this morning. There's obviously been a lot of hand-wringing over how Democrats treated the State of the Union address. Let me read you what your colleague in the Senate, John Fetterman, had to say. He called the Democrat response a sad cavalcade of self-owns and unhinged petulance. It only makes Trump look more presidential and restrained. We're becoming the metaphorical car alarms that nobody pays attention to, and it may not be the winning message.\n\nDoes Senator Fetterman have a point?\n\nADAM SCHIFF: Well, I think the lack of a coordinated response in the State of the Union was a mistake, and frankly it took the focus off of where it should have been which is on the fact that the president spoke for an hour and 40 minutes and had nothing to say about what he would do to bring down costs for American families that were watching that lengthy address, sitting at the kitchen table, hoping that he would offer something to help them afford a new home or pay their rent, afford health care or child care.\n\nThere was nothing for the American people, and that's where we need to keep our focus. I was just listening to your guest precede me trying to explain that these tariffs, these on-again, off-again tariffs, are not about trade. It's a drug war, and then -- but next month it's a trade war, but now it's a drug war. It was incomprehensible, and he was also trying to say that numbers, the job numbers that came in less than expected are somehow good news.\n\nThey're destroying the economy, and they're making it harder and harder for Americans to afford things. That's where we need to keep the focus. That's why we lost the last election because we weren't razor-focused on -- laser-focused on the high cost of living, and what they're doing now is just making it so much worse in the administration, and that's really what we needed to emphasize.\n\nKARL: You've made it clear you're opposed to these tariffs. Is there anything that Democrats can do to stand in the way?\n\nSCHIFF: Well, look. I think we need to bring home to the American people what these tariffs are going to mean. They voted for Donald Trump supposedly because they wanted lower prices, and these tariffs are just going to drive prices up. I think they already are.\n\nIn California, the top issue for people is they need more housing. They need more affordable housing. Well, if you begin by deporting construction workers and then you continue by raising costs on construction materials like lumber, you're just driving those housing prices even further beyond the means of most Americans. So this is deeply destructive what they're doing. We need to make that case to the American people because they're going to feel it, but, you know, taking our eye off the ball I think is very dangerous, and so let's be focused on what matters most to Americans.\n\nLet's point out all the destructive harms they're doing with, you know, the cutting of services, the slashing of the Medicaid and what that's going to mean for increased health costs and less access for people. That, to me, is the winning case to make.\n\nKARL: I'm going to be talking shortly to UAW president Sean Fain. He was obviously, you know, a big supporter of Kamala Harris, a prominent speaker at your Democraticconvention over the summer.\n\nHe likes Trump's tariffs.\n\nIs there a risk that in your opposition to this -- and I mean you, the party's opposition to this -- that Democrats could lose even more ground among working-class Americans?\n\nSCHIFF: Oh, look, I read Shawn's statement. I think he doesn't favor tariffs if they're about drug or unrelated policy, and I think it may make sense to look at targeted actions that can -- we can take to bring back American jobs like auto jobs.\n\nBut these are cross the board tariffs that are indiscriminate, that that are imposed one day and taken down the next.\n\nI can tell you the effect that they're having in California because I talk to people -- I talked to citrus farmers for example who still haven't recovered the market share they lost during the first Trump administration with these tariff wars.\n\nSo I think these broad, indiscriminate and on again, off again tariffs don't help anyone.\n\nKARL: I mean, we’ll --\n\nSCHIFF: They don't help farmers. They don't help auto workers. They're a mistake.\n\nKARL: I mean, we'll -- we'll talk to him in a few minutes, but I mean, he seemed to be saying that he favored these, you know, broad tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and also didn't seem troubled by the one-month pause.\n\nBut -- but let me -- let me ask you more broadly on -- on the Democratic response. Here's what James Carville had by way of suggestion to how Democrats should handle this moment. It was somewhat counterintuitive.\n\nHe said: With no clear leader to voice our opposition and no control in any branch of government, it's time for Democrats to embark on the most daring political mover -- maneuver in the history of our party. Roll over and play dead. Allow Republicans to crumble beneath their own weight and make the American people miss us.\n\nIs that a possible course of action?\n\nSCHIFF: You know, I have great respect for James Carville, but I don't agree with him on this. I do think that that the abundant corruption of the Trump administration, the self-dealing, the inconsistency, the economic decline that they're advancing with their inconsistent and half-hazard policies, yes, will cause the administration to collapse of its own weight.\n\nBut that's I think, first of all, not an answer to what Democrats need to do, which is we need to have our own broad, bold agenda to improve the economic well-being of Americans, to answer really the central question I think at the heart of our political challenges which is, if you're working hard in America, can you still earn a good living?\n\nWe need to be advancing policies and making the arguments about what we have to offer, not simply standing back and letting them collapse over their own corrupt weight.\n\nTo me, that's not enough. We need to effectively use litigation as we are. We need to effectively use communication to talk to new people in new ways, as we are. So I -- I don't agree with that philosophy.\n\nKARL: One approach we're seeing from -- from your governor, from Gavin Newsom, he's got this new podcast. He made some waves by bringing conservative commentator Charlie Kirk on the debut of his podcast.\n\nLet me play you a little section on this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHARLIE KIRK, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: Would you do something like that? Would you say no men in female sports?\n\nGOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D), CALIFORNIA: Well, it's -- I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness.\n\nKIRK: So --\n\nNEWSOM: It's deeply unfair.\n\nThere's also a humility and grace, you know, that -- that these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression. And the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKARL: I mean, I guess, first, what would you think about Newsom sitting down with Charlie Kirk? But more importantly, do you think -- do you agree with those in your party who say it is time for Democrats to have a different approach to transgender issues?\n\nSCHIFF: Well, first of all, I agree that we should be broadening our reach and talking to people we haven't been talking to. I’m not sure that I would start with Charlie Kirk.\n\nBut I also think, as I was mentioning earlier, that we need to keep the focus on what matters most to the American people, and that is the economy. We need to be talking to people about how we're going to improve their quality of life, and we can make sure that if they're working hard, they're earning a good living, to the degree that we get after -- we get away from focusing on those things I think it's a mistake.\n\nIn terms of the particular issue that the governor was talking about -- look, I played in sports. Our kids played in sports. I want all young people to have the experience of playing in sports, every young person.\n\nAnd I want those sports to be fair. I want those sports to be safe, and I have confidence that local schools and local communities can make those decisions without the federal government making them for them.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKARL: But is he right on that? Is -- is he right on that?\n\nSCHIFF: I think to the degree -- to -- well, to the degree though, I think as a -- as a political matter, that we remove the focus from where most Americans are concerned and that is they're concerned about their ability to provide for their family. I think to degree that we get away from that, that's a mistake.\n\nKARL: OK. All right.

All used the same autopen signature except for the announcement that the former President was dropping out of the race last year. Here is the autopen signature,\" the group claimed on X, accompanied by photo examples. Autopen signatures are ones that are automatically produced by a machine, as opposed to an authentic, handwritten signature. 'EMBARRASSINGLY WRONG': LIBERAL MEDIA FIGURES ADMIT BEING IN DENIAL ABOUT BIDEN'S MENTAL DECLINE The Oversight Project posted three examples showing Biden’s signature, including two executive orders and the president’s announcement he was bowing out of the 2024 presidential race. The signature on the two executive orders, one of which was signed in 2022 and the other in 2024, showed the same signature that included what appeared to be a line, followed by \"R. Biden Jr.\" CRITICISMS MOUNT THAT BIDEN IS A 'SHADOW' OF HIMSELF AFTER DISASTROUS DEBATE: 'NOT THE SAME MAN' FROM VP ERA Biden’s signature on the document announcing his departure from the 2024 race varied from the other two posted by the Oversight Project, showing a signature that wasn’t as clear as the one on the executive orders. Fox News Digital, at random, examined more than 20 Biden-era executive orders documented on the Federal Register’s office between 2021 and 2024 and found each had the same signature. LIES ABOUT BIDEN'S AGE, HEALTH DURING HIS PRESIDENCY IS A 'SCANDAL OF EPIC PROPORTIONS,' SCOTT JENNINGS SAYS Fox News Digital reached out to Biden’s office for comment on the Oversight Project’s findings on the autopen investigation, but did not immediately receive a reply on Sunday. Fox News Digital also examined the signatures on President Donald Trump’s executive orders, which are often signed in public or in front of the media, during his first administration and second administration and found the signatures were also the same. Biden and his administration, however, came under fierce concern and scrutiny over his mental acuity last year. The year 2024 kicked off with Biden in the driver’s seat of the Democratic Party as he keyed up a re-election effort in what was shaping up to be a rematch against Trump. In February of that year, however, Biden’s 81 years of age and mental acuity fell under public scrutiny after years of conservatives questioning the commander in chief’s mental fitness. Special counsel Robert Hur, who was investigating Biden’s alleged mishandling of classified documents as vice president, announced he would not recommend criminal charges against Biden for possessing classified materials after his vice presidency, calling Biden \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" The report renewed scrutiny over Biden’s mental fitness, which rose to a fever pitch in June 2024 after the president’s first and only presidential debate against Trump. BIDEN INSIDER EXPOSES HOW WHITE HOUSE 'GASLIT' THE PUBLIC ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT'S DECLINE Biden faced backlash for a handful of gaffes and miscues in the days leading up to his ill-fated debate against Trump, including former President Barack Obama taking Biden’s wrist and appearing to lead him off a stage during a swank fundraiser, and also abroad when Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni guided Biden back to a group of world leaders when he appeared to wander off to give a thumbs-up to a parachutist during the G-7 summit. When the big debate day arrived, Biden missed his marks repeatedly, tripping over his responses and appearing to lose his train of thought as he squared off against Trump. The disastrous debate performance led to an outpouring from both conservatives and traditional Democrat allies calling on the president to bow out of the race in favor of a younger generation. Biden dropped out of the race in July, with the signature on that official document showing it was noticeably different from the signature on his EOs. Republican Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey sent a letter to the Department of Justice on Wednesday of last week demanding an investigation be opened into whether Biden’s \"cognitive decline allowed unelected staff to push through radical policy without his knowing approval.\" \"There are profound reasons to suspect that Biden's staff and political allies exploited his mental decline to issue purported presidential orders without his knowing approval,\" the letter read. \"Speaker Johnson, for example, reported that staff and elected officials – including former Vice President Kamala Harris and former Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer – tried to prevent Johnson from meeting with Biden,\" it continued. BIDEN RIPPED FOR ‘OLD’ APPEARANCE, ‘WEAK’ VOICE DURING FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: ‘DEEPLY ALARMING’ \"Though presidents always have gatekeepers, in Biden's case, the walls around him were higher and the controls greater, according to Democratic lawmakers, donors and aides who worked for Biden and other administrations. Staff limited Biden's ability to speak with others and limited the sources of information he consumed.\" The Oversight Project shared Bailey’s letter in its thread investigating Biden’s signature on official documents, in addition to an interview with Speaker Johnson, R-La., when he recounted that Biden didn’t remember signing an order freezing new liquid natural gas exports in 2024. \"I didn’t do that,\" the president said, Johnson recounted during an interview with the Free Press’ Bari Weiss in January. \"Sir, you paused it, I know. I have the export terminals in my state. I talked to those people in my state, I’ve talked to those people this morning, this is doing massive damage to our economy, national security,\" Johnson said he told the president at the time. \"I walked out of that meeting with fear and loathing because I thought, ‘We are in serious trouble – who is running the country?’\" Johnson said of the 2024 meeting. \"Like, I don’t know who put the paper in front of him, but he didn’t know,\" he added. The Oversight Project continued in its findings that investigators should determine \"who controlled the autopen\" during the Biden administration. \"For investigators to determine whether then-President Biden actually ordered the signature of relevant legal documents, or if he even had the mental capacity to, they must first determine who controlled the autopen and what checks there were in place. Given President Biden's decision to revoke Executive Privilege for individuals advising Trump during his first Presidency, this is a knowable fact that can be determined with the correct legal process?\" the Oversight Project posted to X. BIDEN HAD NO IDEA HE SIGNED NATURAL GAS EXPORT PAUSE, JOHNSON SAYS Concerns over Biden’s mental acuity when he was in office, combined with the Oversight Project’s findings, have sparked outrage among conservative social media users as they question if Biden personally signed the executive orders.

Who sold offensive weapons to Ukraine first? Who warned Germany not to become dependent on the Russian Nord Stream II deal?\n\nWho withdrew from an unfair missile deal with the Russians? Who cajoled and berated NATO members to meet their military investment promises made following the 2014 invasion of Ukraine?\n\nIn contrast, who originally conceived a Russian “reset” in 2009? Who publicly virtue-signaled pushing the red “reset” button in Geneva with the current Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov?\n\nWhich ex-European leader got a million euros a year working for Russian energy companies?\n\nOf the last four presidents, under whose watch did Putin not invade another country?\n\nWhich American president, in hot-mic style, offered to (and did) dismantle US-Eastern Europe missile defense plans in exchange for temporary Putin quietude (“space”) to aid his 2012 reelection?\n\nFable two: A trade war?\n\nPresident Trump is not wildly slapping tariffs on Europeans.\n\nHe is simply saying that 1945 is now 80 years past, and that the asymmetrical tariffs Europe imposes on US imports should be corrected.\n\nThe massive trade surpluses Europe accumulates each year should give way to fairer, more balanced trade.\n\nIf Europe does not want tariffs, then simply calibrate its own tariffs on what America places on European imported goods, and work down jointly to zero tariffs on both sides.\n\nFable three: America is bullying Europe?\n\nThe US does not actively interfere in European elections and politics.\n\nIn 2024, Europeans, especially the British Laborites, bragged about sending over campaign “volunteers” to work against Trump and, earlier, his conservative predecessors.\n\nBritish subject Christopher Steele sought to sabotage an entire American 2016 election with a falsified “dossier.”\n\nThe Ukrainian ambassador in 2016 wrote an op-ed all but endorsing Hillary Clinton and trashing her opponent.\n\nIn September 2024, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was flown on a Biden-provided US military jet to Scranton, Pennsylvania — at a pivotal time in the most pivotal swing state — to surround himself with Democrat politicos.\n\nHis media-frenzied presence signaled a partisan campaign theme that a Kamala Harris win and the continuance of massive Democrat aid to Ukraine would ensure manufacturing jobs, such as the artillery shell factory he selected to visit.\n\nAs to NATO, Trump’s pressure from 2017 to 2021 finally pushed more NATO nations to rearm.\n\nBut even 11 years after promising to invest a mere 2% of GDP in defense, nine of the 32 members still have not complied.\n\nFable four: Negotiating with Putin is selling out?\n\nIn the long history of Western diplomacy with mass-murdering tyrants, Putin doesn’t even rank among the worst.\n\nJust ask his former reset partners Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\nFDR fueled mass-murdering “Uncle Joe” Stalin’s Red Army as a way to defeat Nazi Germany.\n\nRichard Nixon flattered and cajoled the greatest mass murderer in history, Mao Zedong, to triangulate China against the Soviet Union.\n\nRonald Reagan offered to share missile defense expertise with Soviet Russia.\n\nEuropeans have hosted almost every Palestinian murderous terrorist leader, as a way either of deflecting terrorism from their own shores or emphasizing their general loathing of Israel.\n\nFable five: Europe is going to save Ukraine?\n\nEurope rushed to congratulate and celebrate with Zelensky after his pre-planned White House blow-up.\n\nThey are loudly announcing that a supposedly isolationist and appeasing United States — which has sent more aid to Ukraine than all nearby European nations combined — will now be supplanted by a “new” muscular and rearmed Europe.\n\nWe sincerely hope so.\n\nBut on every recent international moral question — ganging up on a lone Israel to appease terrorist forces in the Middle East, standing up to China’s mercantilism, neo-imperialism, and domestic oppression of minorities, Russia’s prior 2008 and 2014 invasions — European outrage has been muted, real consequences nonexistent.\n\nWe are now witnessing European heads of state sending the same old virtue-signaling support for the brave Zelensky, who supposedly spoke truth to power to the mean US Orange Man.\n\nBut where does such performance art lead after the cult hero Zelensky gnawed the hand that gorged him?\n\nTo multitudes of European tanks, skies full of European jets, and division after division of crack European infantry now heading east to “back up” Ukraine — led on horseback by its new Joan of Arc, Ursula von der Leyen?\n\nAside from all the present posturing and mock-heroics, the only way to save Ukraine is for the US president, Donald Trump, to reflect joint Ukrainian, American and European interests in stopping the war, forcing Putin as far back eastward as possible toward where he started in 2022, and creating a credible deterrent along with a DMZ/industrial corridor tripwire to stop another invasion.\n\nAnything else is empty carnival barking.\n\nVictor Davis Hanson is a distinguished fellow of the Center for

prominent Democrat to buck the party and echo majority public opinion on trans athletes","text":"Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom is no stranger to going against the grain on significant social issues.\n\nFour years before California voters passed a ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage in 2008, then-San Francisco Mayor Newsom instructed the city clerk to issue marriage licenses to gay couples, defying federal law and solidifying his reputation as a longtime ally of the LGBTQ community.\n\nThat history was top of mind for several Democrats last week, when the governor said in his new podcast that transgender girls and women participating in female sports leagues is “deeply unfair.” The comments made him the most prominent Democrat to buck the party and echo public opinion on an issue that helped shape the 2024 election and could be a political liability once more in 2028.\n\nThe episode quickly made good on the promise of the podcast, advertised as a place where the governor would “answer the hard questions.” Chief among those: Are there limits to the party’s support for transgender Americans?\n\n“The issue of fairness is completely legit,” Newsom said on “This Is Gavin Newsom” last week. “And we’ve got to own that. We’ve got to acknowledge it.”\n\nDemocrats have spent the last several years pushing back on a wave of anti-transgender bills and rhetoric led by Republicans, including Donald Trump, who made banning transgender athletes from women’s sports a key part of his 2024 campaign.\n\nMost Democrats have been steadfast in their opposition to restricting or rolling back transgender rights. But in the wake of Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss, millions in attack ads and public polling showing a majority of Americans disagree with Democrats on transgender athletes, some members of the party are acknowledging the political dilemma facing them.\n\nA January New York Times/Ipsos poll found that 79% of Americans — including 67% of Democrats — said they believed female transgender athletes should not be allowed to play on women’s sports teams. A Pew Research poll released last month found that 66% of Americans favor laws that require transgender girls and women to play on the teams of the gender they were assigned at birth.\n\nThe same poll also found that 56% of Americans favor laws that prevent discrimination against transgender Americans.\n\nFor many Democrats, the debate was heightened in the aftermath of Harris’ loss, and the outsize impact of a Trump campaign ad that highlighted her past support for gender-affirming surgery for prison inmates. “Kamala’s agenda is they/them, President Trump is for you,” one ad said. Further down the ballot, Democratic Senate candidates Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Colin Allred of Texas, both of whom lost their races, also faced ads focusing on transgender girls in sports.\n\nOne Democratic strategist who has worked on California campaigns said the party shouldn’t change its positions on transgender issues, but rather rethink how it discusses them.\n\n“I’ve said this to my clients a million times: You get to decide what you talk about, when you talk about it, and how you talk about it,” the strategist said. “And if we’re talking about the trans community, we should do the same thing we did with the broader LGBT community, which is talk about it in ways that are relatable to people who don’t understand what it means to be trans.”\n\nIn Washington, Democrats have remained mostly united on transgender rights issues, while attempting to shift their messaging. Only two House Democrats voted to approve legislation to restrict transgender girls and women from playing in many female sports leagues. No Senate Democrats voted to advance the same measure, which failed last week.\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, argued that decisions about whether transgender girls should be allowed to participate in female sports leagues should be decided at the local level, where parents and players can participate.\n\n“While Republicans are focused on playing politics with children’s sports leagues, I’m focused on the issue that I hear about from constituents every day. I’m focused on lowering household costs,” she said.\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, attempted to straddle a line between supporting transgender athletes broadly while also echoing Republican arguments on fairness.\n\n“The way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with. So, both things I can hold in my hand,” Newsom said on the podcast, which featured conservative activist Charlie Kirk. “How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that, I think, is inherent in you, but not always expressed on the issue, but at the same time, deal with the unfairness?”\n\nLater in the interview, Newsom noted how “devastating” the “they/them” ad was for Harris, specifically references to her past support for taxpayer-funded gender-affirming surgery for detained migrants.\n\n“She didn’t even react to it, which was even more devastating,” Newsom said, later adding: “This was even more challenging because it’s issues of people who are incarcerated … illegal, incarcerated individuals getting taxpayer-funded, gender reassignment surgery. That is a 90/10, not an 80/20.”\n\nIn a statement, Newsom’s office said he has said the issue of transgender athletes should be “guided by fairness, dignity, and respect.”\n\n“He rejects the right wing’s cynical attempt to weaponize this debate as an excuse to vilify individual kids,” the statement said. “The Governor’s position is simple: stand with all kids and stand up to bullies.”\n\nLGBTQ groups strongly condemned Newsom’s comments calling it “deeply unfair” for transgender athletes to play in women’s sports leagues, even as they praised him for being a longtime ally. The leaders of the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus, which unveiled a slate of transgender rights bills in the state legislature earlier this month, said they were “profoundly sickened and frustrated” by Newsom’s comments.\n\n“I’m not going to speculate on his strategy here, but I do know, in running for public office that you use addition, right? You try to earn more votes, and I see this as actually a net loss,” Democratic California Assemblymember Chris Ward, the chair of the caucus, told CNN. “People who are already decided on this issue are probably also pretty decided on him.”\n\nWard said he still expects to find agreement on the caucus’s agenda, which includes expediting new California IDs for transgender and nonbinary individuals who change their names and making court records on name changes confidential.\n\nRob Stutzman, a Republican strategist based in California, described Newsom’s podcast as an effort to “abandon his posture of resistance” and find a new political lane. But he also agreed with the substance of what the governor said.\n\n“Democrats are on the wrong end of an 80/20 issue when it comes to this, so I think he’s right,” Stutzman said. “I don’t think the timing is courageous.”\n\nNewsom, a possible 2028 presidential candidate who campaigned for former President Joe Biden and Harris, is the most high-profile Democrat to shift on transgender athletes, but not the first. After the November election, Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat, said his party spent too much time trying not to offend people instead of being “brutally honest.”\n\n“I have two little girls. I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I’m supposed to be afraid to say that,” Moulton told The New York Times in November.\n\nMoulton, who faced his own swift backlash from Democrats, described Newsom’s comments as a step in the right direction for the party and said he hoped other Democrats would follow his lead.\n\n“It took 120 days for a fellow Democrat to come out and agree with me publicly, even though I’ve had countless colleagues come up to me privately and say, ‘Yeah, you’re right on this and Democrats just need to get real,’” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” on Friday. “The right thing to do is to engage in these issues and listen to 80% of Americans when they say this is a problem.”\n\nTransgender rights advocates have argued that Democrats shouldn’t retreat on the issues, especially at a time when Republicans are launching a concerted effort to regulate broad areas of transgender Americans’ lives.\n\nIn recent years, Republicans across the country have introduced hundreds of bills restricting transgender rights, including measures on youth sports, gender-affirming care, access to public restrooms and ID changes. Since taking office for his second term, Trump’s administration has introduced a wave of measures limiting the rights of transgender Americans, including an executive order banning transgender girls and women from female sports leagues and moves to restrict trans Americans from serving in the military.\n\n“Our message to Gov. Newsom and all leaders across the country is simple: The path to 2028 isn’t paved with the betrayal of vulnerable communities — it’s built on the courage to stand up for what’s right and do the hard work to actually help the American people,” Kelley Robinson, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/newsom-becomes-most-prominent-democrat-152449330.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DGrYrLZY9tx.C01I2F2q4w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/cab516b61d09407d50dbe0dcd0147279","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 15:24:49","author":"Arit John","authors":["Arit John"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.008},{"id":298350772,"title":"Trump's Canada, Mexico tariffs try to 'stop the bleeding' in US economy: UAW chief","text":"President Donald Trump's tariffs on Canada and Mexico are an \"attempt to stop the bleeding\" in the American economy, United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain told \"This Week\" on Sunday in defense of the controversial measures.\n\n\"We're in a crisis mode in this country,\" Fain said, suggesting America's trade system is \"broken\" and in need of drastic reform. \"We're in a triage situation,\" he added.\n\nTariffs \"aren't the end solution,\" Fain explained, \"but they are a huge factor in fixing this problem.\"\n\n\"Tariffs are an attempt to stop the bleeding from the hemorrhaging of jobs in America for the last 33 years,\" Fain said, suggesting the U.S. had lost \"millions of jobs\" since the inception of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994.\n\n\"NAFTA sucks,\" Fain said.\n\n\"The United States is the market everyone wants to sell in and we should have reciprocal trade laws where people have the same standard of living,\" Fain continued.\n\n\"Our neighbors to the south -- Mexican workers -- aren't the enemy.

Is Stephen A Smith the way back to the White House?","text":"The View, one of the US’s most popular daytime television programmes, was a vital campaign stop last year for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. This week, it played host to a cable sports channel personality who might be nurturing political ambitions of his own.\n\nStephen A Smith was asked by co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin what he makes of hypothetical polls that show him among the leading contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028.\n\n“I make of it that citizens, particularly on the left, are desperate,” Smith said in characteristically forthright style. “And I mean it when I say it: I think I can beat them all.”\n\nDespite – or because of – his lack of political experience, Smith is emerging as an unlikely force in a Democratic party badly in need of critical friends, fresh ideas and blunt truth-telling. The idea of him running for the White House remains wildly speculative – but speaks volumes about a shift in the US media ecosystem and a blurring of the lines between culture, entertainment and politics.\n\nThe 57-year-old, born Stephen Anthony Smith in the Bronx in New York, began his career in print journalism, writing for newspapers such as the Philadelphia Inquirer, then made his name as a broadcaster, especially on ESPN. Smith is now the co-host of First Take, where he shares provocative opinions on basketball and other topics.\n\nHis fans include Kurt Bardella, a media relations consultant and Democratic strategist who watches First Take “religiously”. Bardella said: “He is out there with passion and charisma and he provokes emotion and conversation and debate. He has become the singular most influential person in all of sports.\n\n“We live in a time where our politics is shaped and informed by culture more than at any time in our history. There’s that old adage that politics is just culture downstream, and Stephen A is a good embodiment of that.”\n\nSmith’s star continues to rise. It emerged this week that he had agreed to a new ESPN contract worth at least $100m for five years. He will continue on First Take but reduce other sports-related obligations, increasing his opportunities for political commentary: in recent months he has appeared on Fox News, NewsNation and HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher.\n\nThe Stephen A Smith Show, which streams on YouTube and iHeart, has featured interviews with Hakeem Jeffries, the House of Representatives Democratic minority leader; rightwing personality Candace Owens; and Andrew Cuomo, in his first interview since announcing his candidacy for New York mayor\n\nThe political chatter around Smith is also a symptom of the demoralisation in the leaderless Democratic party following last November’s defeat in elections for the White House, House and Senate. This week, for example, Democrats struggled to find a coherent response to Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress.\n\nAfter nominating Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in past elections, some in the party hunger for a fighter in the mould of Trump, an outsider not beholden to the traditional political establishment. And witnessing the rise of podcasters such as Joe Rogan and an entire “Maga” media ecosystem, they crave a liberal alternative.\n\nIn Smith, they see a bracing energy. He voted for Harris but has been outspoken in criticising Democrats for failing to connect with voters and for prioritising niche issues – which in his view includes the transgender community – and failing to address the concerns of a broader electorate.\n\nIn January, appearing alongside the Democratic representative Ro Khanna on Real Time with Bill Maher, he offered a blistering diagnosis of why Democrats lost to Trump: “The man was impeached twice, he was convicted on 34 felony counts and the American people still said: ‘He’s closer to normal than what we see on the left.’”\n\nSmith added: “What voter can look at the Democrat party and say: ‘There’s a voice for us, somebody who speaks for us, that goes up on Capitol Hill and fights the fights that we want them fighting on our behalf’?”\n\nHis gift for storytelling and communicating impresses Bardella, a former spokesperson and senior adviser for Republicans on the House oversight committee. Bardella said: “His style of speaking, the directness, the boldness, the bombastic at times kind of PT Barnum-esque quality that he brings to the conversation is exactly what Democrats are lacking and exactly what made Donald Trump the showman such an appealing character to begin with when he arrived on the stage.\n\n“Rather than just dismiss it or make fun of it or ignore it, Democrats would be wise to study what makes him so successful because there is nobody in the Democratic party that is as relevant a voice on a day-to-day basis as Stephen A Smith.”\n\nIt was striking that a January poll by McLaughlin & Associates for the 2028 Democratic nomination decided to include him in a survey that put Kamala Harris at 33%, Pete Buttigieg at 9%, Gavin Newsom at 7%, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at 6%, Josh Shapiro at 3%, Tim Walz at 3% and Smith at 2%.\n\nStill, many Democrats would think twice before gambling on an outsider such as Smith or the billionaire businessman Mark Cuban. Lack of experience could be a liability in the eyes of some voters. Smith’s controversial statements and “yelling” style could alienate certain segments of the electorate. The perception of Smith as a celebrity candidate could undermine his credibility.\n\nBill Whalen, a former media consultant for politicians including the former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, said Smith’s eloquence and in-your-face style could be appealing to voters in this political moment: “But the question is, what does Stephen A Smith believe in at the end of the day? He’s been very vocal criticising the Democratic party. What positions does he hold? What does he believe in?\n\n“The fact is, if you’re going to run for a party’s nomination in America, there are about a half a dozen or so issues in which you need to be on the right side. Otherwise, you’re not going to go very far. Where is Stephen A Smith on abortion? Where is he on DEI? Where is he on quotas and affirmative action? Where is he on crime? Where is he on spending?\n\n“The list goes on. You just don’t know, so my advice to any Democrat looking at this is: before you become a Stephen A Smith supporter, give him a questionnaire and have him fill it out and see what the answers are.”\n\nWhether Smith, who has a recurring guest-acting role on the ABC soap opera General Hospital, would want to take on a gruelling election campaign is far from certain.\n\nHe has expressed ambivalence on the topic but told the Daily Mail last month that “if the American people came to me and looked at me and said ‘Yo, man, we want you to run for office’, and I had a legitimate shot to win the presidency of the United States, I’m not gonna lie. I’ll think about that.”\n\nBut on Friday, Smith’s agent, Mark Shapiro, sought to quell the rumours, insisting at a conference in Boston: “He will not run for president. He’s going to continue to entertain those conversations, but he will not run for president.”\n\nStill, the buzz reveals a bigger picture about Democratic soul-searching in the aftermath of election defeat. Trump proved effective at exploiting the new media ecology of podcasts, TikTok and other platforms in portraying the party as elitist, out of touch and obsessed with “woke” issues. Some Democrats are now recalibrating – for example, by removing gender pronouns from their social media accounts.\n\nDavid Litt, an author and former speechwriter for Barack Obama, said: “Democrats, for most of my lifetime, which is 38 years at this point, sort of assumed we are dominant in the culture, whether or not we’re dominant politically. One of the things we learned from this most recent election is, that may not be the case and either things are more even than we thought or, I would even argue, the right, at least during the election season, took an advantage in the culture.\n\n“It’s important that Democrats are saying our ‘political voices’ may not come from the world of politics, particularly at a moment when people are deeply sceptical of politicians. Who are some people who have ways of thinking and communicating that don’t sound like every politician out there? That search and that openness is going to end up being pretty useful and pretty important one way or the other.”","summary":"The charismatic sports news host has become an unlikely force in a party that needs critical friends and fresh ideas\n\nThe View, one of the US’s most popular daytime television programmes, was a vital campaign stop last year for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

We’re Just Watching It","text":"Taylor Sheridan has a complete disrespect for one of my treasured possessions: downtime. In just seven years, Sheridan has created eight TV shows resulting in 164 episodes, the overwhelming majority of which he wrote entirely himself. Let that soak in for a moment. Here’s a quantitative but not qualitative comparison: Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul combined were shot over 14 years and total 125 episodes. That’s still a day-and-a-half of television short of Sheridan’s output.\n\n And here’s the thing: All eight shows are hits, something that not even TV titans like Dick Wolf or Shonda Rhimes can claim. And unlike Wolf, Sheridan has triumphed over multiple genres. Sure, there are three shows in the Yellowstone universe: original recipe, 1883, and 1923, but Sheridan has since diversified with Lioness, a CIA thriller starring Zoe Saldaña and Nicole Kidman, and Landman, an oil industry melodrama starring Billy Bob Thornton and Jon Hamm. (Sheridan has three other TV colonies where he maintains only, say, 96 percent control, like the Brits had over India pre-1939: Tulsa King, Mayor of Kingstown, and Lawmen: Bass Reeves).\n\n It is not hard to see the allure of Sheridan’s shows. He casts movie stars of a certain vintage, some perfectly utilized (Thornton on Landman), some apparently forgotten after casting (Demi Moore has fewer quality lines than Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones on the same show). \n\n Then, he makes it all look gorgeous. Sheridan shoots Americana with Vaseline on the lenses, a greater feat on Landman, where Texas oil fields are filmed at magic hour and even the hideous burn-off of natural gas is made to look romantic. His shows can be enjoyed as either camp in the Dallas/Dynasty model or, depending on your politics, a glimpse into an America forgotten by the Hollywood suits. How Sheridan creates these worlds complements the theme of one brave man — occasionally, a woman — taking on the malignant forces hell-bent on destroying this country. \n\n An hour of episodic television is usually breech-birthed in a depressing Hollywood conference room filled with dyspeptic writers arguing over lines as the space fills up with the smell of fear, body odor, and Asian fusion takeout. That’s not how Sheridan works. He writes alone in Wyoming and boasts about turning out scripts in a day and sending them to his actors without studio notes. Sheridan doesn’t play well with others — he refuses to staff his shows — much to the chagrin of the Writers Guild. He tried collaboration for the Sylvester Stallone-led mob-boss-out-of-water series Tulsa King, hiring legendary Sopranos writer and Boardwalk Empire creator Terence Winter. It did not go well. In two years, Sheridan hired, fired, and rehired Winters, who left the show again in December.\n\n Back to downtime, or the lack thereof. Sheridan has at least three shows, operating in different centuries and on various continents, where his characters dismiss the concept of what Daniel Craig would call the weekend. They proudly do not know what day of the week it is and do not care because, you know, there’s work to be done.\n\n Sheridan shares this quality with Elon Musk, who claims he uses Saturdays and Sundays to crush his opposition. “It’s like the opposing team just leaves the field for two days!” Musk has said, according to The New York Times. “Working the weekend is a superpower.” Both Musk and Sheridan are Howard Roark doppelgängers who have something else in common: They have both constructed hugely influential worlds that may or may not be tethered to actual reality. So recently, I made a choice. Following Musk and Sheridan’s example, I ignored the languorous promise of a long weekend and watched 55 episodes of Sheridan’s shows in four days. I am unsure if it made me a better American.\n\n It wasn’t quite as arduous as it sounds. I already had a sentimental attachment to the Sheridan universe and not just because I am a middle-aged white man. In 2018, I profiled the man born Sheridan Taylor Gibler Jr. shortly before the premiere of his first TV show, Yellowstone. Back then, Sheridan was known, if at all, by his scripts for the films Wind River, Sicario, and Hell or High Water, all centered around discarded people acting heroically in the face of power and violence. \n\n I visited Sheridan at his Park City, Utah, home, and he whipped up top-notch steaks with a recipe that mysteriously involved coffee grounds. (He refused to tell me more.) We watched the Yellowstone pilot in his living room, and Sheridan’s eyes filled with tears afterward as he told me why the material meant so much to him; his mother had lost the family ranch in Texas, his childhood home, and it crushed him so much that, according to Sheridan, he spent weeks outside the ranch’s gates with a shotgun, hoping to dissuade buyers. It was like Scarlett O’Hara explaining why she would never go hungry again.\n\n “I had no money,” Sheridan told me. “I fished every fucking fish out of the pond. I shot every deer I could fucking shoot until I was literally… I had nothing. \n\n “I left, and never thought I’d go back,” he said. “But then you realize the ghosts weren’t there. The ghosts are wherever you are.”\n\n Sheridan’s ghosts now have plenty of space to roam. After the success of Yellowstone, he spent $342 million to buy the 266,000-acre Four Sixes Ranch in West Texas. He began to recoup costs by charging Paramount to rent his land, his horses, and his horse wranglers for filming the show. Meanwhile, Yellowstone became a lifestyle brand, with the Dress Like a Dutton Costume Collection clothing line, cutting boards, and coffee mugs. While it’s not clear if Paramount or Sheridan clear the merch profits, Sheridan’s own Four Sixes Ranch vodka also receives promotional play on his shows, and the voluminous footage they offer of his ranch will not hurt its resale value. A cross section of Sheridan’s America — OK, snipers and oilmen — also down Michelob Ultra, an odd watery, low-carb choice for masters of various universes. (On Landman, Thornton’s Tommy is a recovering alcoholic who rationalizes Michelob Ultra does not violate his no-drinking code).\n\n But what motivates that kind of ambition? Let’s ask Cara Dutton, the matriarch of 1923’s Yellowstone Ranch, played by Helen Mirren and written by Sheridan. One morning she watches her husband Jacob — played by promising newcomer Harrison Ford — as he shaves and muses about the latest trend of women shaving their legs and underarms. She wonders aloud what possessed a razor company to convince women they needed to smooth their skin.\n\n “It’s greed,” says Cara. “What does that say about us as a species? It’ll be the thing that ends us. Greed will be the thing that kills us all.”\n\n SHERIDAN’S LANDMAN, AN OIL SAGA starring Thornton and Jon Hamm, is filmed at a leisurely pace. Some scenes happen in real time for seemingly no reason other than to pad a tight six episodes to a more lucrative 10-episode run. (There is a “get on with it, already” pace to most of Sheridan’s shows). Still, there is some dramatic tension: the need to keep the oil flowing, no matter the human cost. On a related note, Sheridan’s overhead requires the same; there must always be product in the pipeline.\n\n And that’s been a problem — well, at least for discerning, weak-kneed cosmopolitan viewers like me. Sheridan’s greatest creation of the past seven years was 1883, a Yellowstone prequel starring Tim McGraw and Faith Hill as the original Duttons making their way out West. What sets 1883 apart from the Sheridan pack is crisp storytelling — paying significant homage to Sheridan’s love of Larry McMutry’s Lonesome Dove along the way. In short, 1883 has a beginning and an end. The original Duttons are either going to make it to Montana, or they’re gonna die. (Spoiler alert: Most of them make it). \n\n Sheridan’s cantering does allow for storytelling that is perfect for the Trump-Musk world: long monologues, mostly by men who see themselves as infallible truth-tellers. West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin’s shows were known for the walk and talk, but Sheridan favors the stop and talk, where one of his squinty-eyed, seen-it-all stand-ins launches into a speech. The lyrics change, but not the melody of Sheridan’s worldview: The past was better, the present is unbearable, and change is the enemy.\n\n Across the Sheridan-verse, the soliloquies are delivered by a variety of players — ranch matriarchs, Mexican cartel kingpins, a Black statesman, a frozen-faced Nicole Kidman, and even a sadistic banker played by lesser James Bond Timothy Dalton. Despite their different creeds, genders, and timelines, it is all the standard white-guy lament, offering a unifying worldview with the cozy sameness of a pork chop entrée that can be ordered at a thousand Applebee’s.\n\n Yellowstone’s John Dutton, played by Kevin Costner, is Sheridan’s OG no-change agent. In Season Five, Dutton, an amoral rancher, is elected governor of Montana. He doesn’t use his inaugural address to address the dreams of the children. Instead, he offers a statement of purpose that Bill O’Reilly could have delivered in 2004. \n\n “I am the opposite of progress,” proclaims Dutton. “I am the wall it bashes against, and I will not be the one who breaks.”\n\n Sheridan’s characters often reminisce about a time when everyone in America worked together toward a greater good. It was not that long ago. In Lioness, Morgan Freeman plays Secretary of State Edward Mullins, a Democrat with a heart of gold, who pops in to see his CIA Deputy of Operations, played grimly by Michael Kelly of House of Cards fame. The two have a sordid mission to coordinate, but first Mullins reflects on the good old days, namely 9/11 and George W. Bush.\n\n “You will recall, there was some question about the legitimacy of the election of our 43rd president, so much so that we decided that his first term would be his only term,” says Mullins. “We stonewalled every appointment. Then, 9/11 and instantly everybody in the United States turned to him as our Commander in Chief. Say what you want about what he did after, but we needed a leader, and a leader arose.” \n\n Mullins pauses and ponders the imponderable.\n\n “What got us to where we are today?”\n\n Well, you could argue that George Bush bullshitting us into Iraq got us on the road to where we are today, but Mullins has a different answer: The media fucked us.\n\n “The New York Times, the Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal — they stopped reporting the news and started telling us what they think the news is and what our opinion of that news should be. Americans have always been gullible, but they’re not stupid. Lie to them enough and they won’t trust you to tell them the sun’s rising.” (On Yellowstone, Sheridan has a New York City magazine writer come to Montana to investigate land shenanigans. She is strangled by a Dutton who gets away with it). \n\n Perhaps Sheridan’s greatest magic trick occurs on Landman, where the adept acting of Billy Bob Thornton and Jon Hamm make the case that Thornton’s oil-field fixer and Hamm’s billionaire are the true American martyrs. Early in the show, Thornton’s Tommy takes a city slicker lady lawyer out into the oil fields. The lawyer spots a wind turbine and asks Tommy what is this monstrosity. (The fact that a lawyer doesn’t know what a wind turbine is in 2024 strains credulity.) Tommy pulls up to the behemoth and explains the petro facts of life in a speech that could have been cribbed from the American Petroleum Institute’s website.\n\n “Do you have any idea how much diesel they have to burn to mix that much concrete?” (She does not!) “Or make that steel? And haul this shit out here and put it together with a 450-foot crane? You want to take a guess how much oil it takes to lubricate that fucking thing? Or winterize it? In its 20-year lifespan, it won’t offset the carbon footprint of making it. And don’t get me started on solar panels or the lithium in your Tesla battery. And never mind the fact that if the whole world decided to go electric tomorrow, we wouldn’t have the transmission lines to get the electricity to the cities.”\n\n The lawyer, played by Kayla Wallace, listens with the sorrowful look of a child who has burned down a Ronald McDonald house with her terminally ill brother inside. Somehow, Tommy is just getting started. He reminds her that oil is in everything from plastics to tires to antihistamines. And then comes the big finish. \n\n “You know what the kicker is,” says Tommy. “We’re going to run out of it before we find its replacement. Getting oil out of the ground is the most dangerous job in the world. We don’t do it because we like it. We do it because we’ve run out of options. There ain’t nobody to blame but the demand that we keep pumping it.”\n\n The lawyer has now been reduced to a human husk. Still, Sheridan climbs to the top rope again and drops another hammer shot. Suddenly, a rattlesnake appears at the lawyer’s feet. She is scared! Tommy gets a shovel and beheads alt energy — I mean, the rattler.\n\n Unwittingly, the whole exchange echoes Mullins’ lament in Lioness about the media telling us what to believe. You might remember all the rending of garments when Kamala Harris appeared on Saturday Night Live and the MAGA world screamed that Trump deserves equal time. But one-sided storytelling gets its revenge on Sheridan’s shows, because man, there is information out there that rebuts the previous three minutes brought to you by your friends at Big Oil, including research that suggests a wind turbine actually offsets its energy cost in just 100 days and emits about 29 fewer tons of carbon dioxide in its lifetime as an oil well does. (This is a pretty good rebuttal.) \n\n There’s no pushback or nuance; it’s just microwaved confirmation bias. It reminded me of something that Gene Hackman said in a 1996 Washington Post profile that resurfaced after his death. “There is some quote that people live their lives trying to change the world to fit their own prejudices,” said Hackman. “That’s kind of interesting. We all do that to some extent. We make the world the way we want it to be.” \n\n WHILE SHERIDAN’S DUDES are mansplaining, most of his women are so far behind that I’m surprised he hasn’t created a show called 1963. In Yellowstone, Sheridan’s idea of a female heroine is Beth (Kelly Reilly), John Dutton’s daughter and wartime consigliere. Beth exists in an extreme DGAF world, even for melodrama. She starts bar fights, executes enemies by rattlesnake, and carries vodka in her purse. At first glimpse, she’s a welcome change in the pantheon of television, a female antihero. But Beth descends into camp as the series chugs onward. At one point, she proclaims, “You need to be closer when you look at me. I ruin careers for a living.”\n\n In the end, Beth triumphs by murdering her brother Jamie in a gory knife fight that answers the question what would the world have looked like if Glenn Close’s character in Fatal Attraction were more adept at blade play. Sheridan seems to be suggesting that a woman needs to be twice as sociopathic as a man to succeed in modern America. \n\n Even when Sheridan does right by women, he does wrong by them. Sheridan’s 2016 film Wind River is particularly powerful in its account of sexual violence targeting Native Americans, and is one of many examples of Sheridan admirably and realistically portraying indigenous injustice in the white-man world. Of course, Sheridan, being Sheridan, pissed off the very same people when he claimed that Wind River was responsible for the passing of the Violence Against Women Act. “Taylor Sheridan’s attempt to take credit for the passage of VAWA is gross and completely discredits years of tireless advocacy from the Native community,” Native rights attorney Mary Kathryn Nagle posted on social media. “Sheridan should be apologizing, not taking credit for a victory secured by Indian Country advocates and led by Native women.” \n\n He doesn’t always fail. On 1883, Elsa Dutton is a free-spirit teenager without a dark heart. She falls in love, rides bravely, and dies heroically, the best a woman can hope for in Sheridan’s world. Elements of her can be found on Lioness in Zoe Saldaña’s Joe McNamara, a CIA operative trying to save the world from the swarthy — terrorists in Season One, Mexican cartels in Season Two — while raising two girls. She has an infinitely patient surgeon husband whom she occasionally talks to over a bottle of wine as they dangle their feet in the pool at their stately D.C. home. McNamara kills bad guys by the score in a world off its axis while berating herself over neglecting her children, a lament that any modern parent can identify with. (Except for the part about calling in drone strikes).\n\n Joe is also a mentor of sorts. She trains Cruz Manuelos, a young Marine, to be a lioness, a.k.a. a government-sanctioned murderer. Manuelos is expertly played by Laysla De Oliveira who, along with Saldaña, is at the top of the class of Sheridan’s actresses. That’s the good news. In Season One, Joe trains Cruz to befriend the daughter of a terrorist financier, infiltrate her world, and then kill her father. Complications arise when Cruz falls in love with the daughter. OK, lame plot device, but this is network television. Cruz returns in Season Two, where Joe wants her to watch over a female helicopter pilot who Joe needs to betray her drug kingpin dad. And… Cruz falls in love with the pilot. They talk about how they want to go to town on each other just before they fly a helo into a firefight.\n\n I mean, people, what are we doing here? Sure, the material is not Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, but it doesn’t seem too much to expect your female co-lead not to violate a key part of spycraft in her first two attempts.\n\n Still, Saldaña and De Oliveira are Arya Stark and Mary Richards in comparison to the Landman women. The show gives an unsolicited glimpse of what The Dukes of Hazzard would have looked like if it had been on late-night Cinemax. Thornton’s Tommy has an ex-wife and a daughter who are seemingly characters plucked from dubious scenarios on PornHub. Michelle Randolph plays Ainsley Norris, Tommy’s 17-year-old nubile high school senior. (Randolph is 27.) In the pilot, Tommy asks Ainsley if she is having sex with her quarterback boyfriend. She says yes, but they are being careful: “We have a rule. As long as he never comes in me he can come anywhere on me.” \n\n A quick consultation with my Texas-based friends tells me that 0.00 percent think it is realistic that a Texas belle would say this to her oilman father. More madness ensues from there. Ainsley moves into the McMansion that Tommy shares with two other fifty-ish oil guys. She proceeds to prance around the house in underwear and crop top, climbing on a stool to get something. The camera lingers, Three’s Company-style. And then her mom shows up. Angela Norris (played by Ali Larter) taunts Tommy, her ex, by FaceTiming with him and revealing she is wearing a bikini. (She does the same at a Texas country club before passing out from too much tequila.) Of course, Tommy takes Angela back, and now MILF and daughter are wearing tight clothes and doing aerobic activity in front of the goggle-eye oil guys back at the house. \n\n “I’m never working a day in my life,” Angela tells Ainsley. “My only job is to make my man happy; then he will buy me the things that make me happy. I will reward him with sex. That’s the way the world works, honey.”\n\n Well, that’s the way Sheridan’s world works for sure. Back on Lioness, a cartel murderer laments the Army in which his daughter served as a combat helicopter pilot. \n\n “The Army does sensitivity training now. When I served, there was none of that shit.” A sneer never leaves his face. “There was no bathroom of the gender you decide you are today or any of that bullshit. Women and fags and fucking ladyboys and dykes. That’s our Army now.”\n\n I guess the fact that the cartel guy’s daughter is a lesbian Army helicopter pilot creates tension and should persuade us this isn’t actually Sheridan’s viewpoint. I settled back on the couch and contemplated how he was going to end this fucker. Spoiler alert: Narco dad does not get his comeuppance. Instead, he beats the shit out of his daughter and gets a promotion courtesy of the CIA. Draw your own conclusions.\n\n IT TURNS OUT THERE IS only one actor capable of defending the American Male Way in Sheridan’s world. That man? Taylor Sheridan.\n\n Yes, the creator made the savior in his own image. In 2024, Sheridan cast himself not once, but twice, in parts that can best be described as the American male hero as douchebag; or, Dan Bongino. In Lioness, Sheridan plays Cody Spears, a black ops sharpshooter who bails out Joe McNamara with a kill count in the hundreds. And then there’s Travis, the loathsome but lovable — OK, only lovable to Sheridan — horse trader and rodeo star on Yellowstone. The last cowboy and the last sniper are pricks, but that’s how things get done. \n\n Still, you can’t look away. Not for the usual reasons. No, it’s because the 54-year-old Sheridan is absolutely ripped, in an RFK Jr. kind of way. I’m not sure if in the history of the world an auteur has ever used his own body so unsubtly to make a point. In Sheridan’s world, the Last American Hero is he, and he will not cede ground to some millennial Buttigieg type. \n\n And you may ask yourself, is Sheridan’s age-defying physique the product of his proudly red-meat diet and hours of daily exercise, because Sheridan has tons of free time? Who can say for sure? Well, OK, we can. (Sheridan’s shows don’t have Easter eggs as much as they have IEDs.) Early in Landman, Tommy, the show’s Sheridan stand-in, begins his day with cigarettes and a testosterone injection.\n\n I LEFT THE FINAL SEASON of Yellowstone for last because of my affection for the show’s roots back in 2018 and my time with Sheridan in Utah. By now, it was pretty clear that Sheridan’s methods — like his fellow empire builder Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now — had become unsound. Still, I pressed on, well aware of the series’ late-season problems, namely Costner’s exiting after losing a dick-measuring contest to Sheridan over scheduling issues. (In a true sign that the Great American Man is out of ideas, Costner left to film Horizon: An American Saga, his own bloated take on the cowboy way, in the form of a four-part movie series.) I still wasn’t prepared.\n\n Even though it was filmed before the 2024 election, Yellowstone’s last season reminded me of nothing more than the first DGAF month of Donald Trump’s second term. Sheridan’s Travis had played a peripheral part in earlier seasons of Yellowstone, but he steps to the forefront in the final episodes. Sheridan/Travis gets to announce the death of Costner/Dutton.\n\n “John Dutton passed away,” Sheridan/Travis says. When asked the details, he replies, “I don’t know, does it matter?”\n\n I guess not. Still, this is minor self-aggrandizement in comparison to the penultimate show of the series, when Dutton’s daughter Beth, fresh off the murder of her father, travels to Travis’ Texas ranch — Sheridan’s aforementioned spread — in hopes of convincing Travis to bring his rodeo show to Montana to help the Yellowstone sell horses in the family’s quixotic attempt to raise money to pay the ranch’s inheritance taxes. \n\n Beth arrives just in time to see Travis and his muscles playing strip poker with his employees. She then observes him screwing over some Brazilian horse buyers. Later, Travis tells Beth the only way he will help her with the sale is if he can film her after she loses a strip poker hand. (Turns out he’s joking, what a mensch!)\n\n At one point, Beth sidles up to Travis’ girlfriend Sadie, who is a quarter-century younger and played by, sigh, Bella Hadid. Beth asks Sadie what the hell she sees in him. \n\n “You ever seen him ride before?”\n\n The camera cuts to Travis playing a game of cat and mouse with a calf — Sheridan is a champion rodeo cutter in real life — expertly moving the junior bovine into capture position. (Somehow Sheridan found an eighth day of the week and has produced five seasons of a rodeo reality show about horse trainers called, uh, The Last Cowboy.) \n\n Beth watches and purrs. \n\n “OK, yeah I get it.”\n\n The scene took me back to Utah and my time with Sheridan. One morning, I sat on an old white nag named Mr. Blue Jeans inside the fence of an indoor corral while Sheridan chased a wide-eyed calf around the ring, much like in the episode. He looked like a goddamn cowboy.\n\n Then, something went wrong. The calf bolted away from Sheridan and headed straight for Mr. Blue Jeans. He sprinted under Jeans’ belly and then ricocheted off a fence.\n\n The narcoleptic Mr. Blue Jeans barely moved. Sheridan rode over, his bravado gone.\n\n “You know how lucky you are?” Sheridan told me. His face was gray. “Any other horse would have thrown you over the fence or pancaked you. Jesus, I’ve never seen that before.” \n\n Sheridan was apologetic and wanted to buy me some cowboy boots as a mea culpa when we got back to town. We argued good naturedly over lunch and, like any decent beta male — the lowest of the low in Sheridan’s worlds — I surrendered. I lied that I really, really liked the $250 boots and wanted to buy them for myself. \n\n I am looking at them now: For sale, cowboy boots never worn.\n\n Mythology has its cost.","summary":"The Yellowstone auteur is printing money with his sprawling TV universe — a place where America is great again, work is glorified, and a lone, brave man saves the day","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/taylor-sheridan-shows-yellowstone-landman-lioness-1235288471/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Taylor_final.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 14:10:16","author":"Stephen Rodrick","authors":["Stephen Rodrick"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.177},{"id":298331546,"title":"Trump allows Cabinet members to make significant cuts to agencies and reveals important information about Elon Musk","text":"Home Celeb Celeb News Trump allows Cabinet members to make significant cuts to agencies and reveals important information about Elon Musk\n\nTrump allows Cabinet members to make significant cuts to agencies and reveals important information about Elon Musk\n\nPublished on 09 March 2025\n\nInternewscast\n\nShare this @internewscast.com\n\nFacebookXRedditPinterest\n\nShare this @internewscast.com\n\nFacebookXRedditPinterest\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nKamala Harris’ niece has mocked Elon Musk after a woman awkwardly claimed online she…\n\nInternewscast\n\nMarch 9, 2025\n\nA doctor with unique experience of the health harms of Daylight Saving…\n\nInternewscast\n\nMarch 8, 2025\n\nCongress has proposed a budget bill that addresses pressing issues regarding Pentagon cuts,…\n\nInternewscast\n\nMarch 9, 2025\n\nLord Coe will demand Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg ‘sort out’ the…\n\nInternewscast\n\nMarch 8, 2025\n\nDonald Trump insists his ‘First Buddy’ Elon Musk and Secretary of State…\n\nInternewscast\n\nMarch 9, 2025\n\nBeing a woman or a Christian in the Democratic Republic of Congo…\n\nInternewscast\n\nMarch 9, 2025\n\nThe White Lotus actor Jason Isaacs has shared his own experience of…\n\nInternewscast\n\nMarch 9, 2025\n\nYouth football teams across Britain have paid tribute to a ten-year-old girl…\n\nInternewscast\n\nMarch 9, 2025\n\nKarla Sofía Gascón is reflecting on the recent tumultuous season of her…\n\nInternewscast\n\nMarch 9, 2025","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThis Post: Trump allows Cabinet members to make significant cuts to agencies and reveals important information about Elon Musk first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-news/trump-allows-cabinet-members-to-make-significant-cuts-to-agencies-and-reveals-important-information-about-elon-musk/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/06/19/95924735-0-image-m-32_1741289164117.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 14:03:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.571},{"id":298351654,"title":"JOSH HAMMER: Dems Still Can’t Figure Out Why Americans Don’t Like Them","text":"Yogi Berra, the mid-century New York Yankees Hall of Fame catcher known for his pithy and often humorous life observations, once famously quipped: “When you come to a fork in the road, take it.” It was sound advice, perhaps, for a traveler on the go and in search of a quick meal. But the modern Democratic Party, rudderless and confused and reeling from a pitiful collective performance during Tuesday evening’s presidential joint address to Congress, now confronts a fork in the road that’s no joke.\n\nOn the one hand lies the path of least resistance: doubling down on the status quo — the progressive culture-warring, woke/identity politics-driven agenda that has dominated the party ever since Barack Obama upset Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. On the other hand lies the more difficult but ultimately more promising path: repudiation of that post-2008 legacy and a conscientious return to a politics of the prudential center. Which path Democrats choose from here will go a long way toward determining their relevance as a national political party for the foreseeable future.\n\nObama’s shocking upset over the madam-president-in-waiting was an inflection point for the institutional trajectory of the Democratic Party. Voters rejected the cultural centrism that was a Clinton-era hallmark in favor of the “hope” and “change” promised by Obama’s “coalition of the ascendant.” Initially, perhaps, that may have looked like a smart bet: Obama trounced John McCain in the 2008 presidential general election. But the one-time “coalition of the ascendant” transmogrified into an identitarian and deeply off-putting “coalition of aggrieved interests.” Culturally militant wokeism eventually reached its pernicious apex during Joe Biden’s presidency — which saw the first explicitly “DEI” Supreme Court justice selection (Ketanji Brown Jackson, after Biden vowed to nominate a black woman) and a DEI vice presidential running mate (Kamala Harris, after Biden was pressured to choose a black woman).\n\nThis version of the Democratic Party, which featured the progenitor of wokeism, Obama himself, as the leading presidential campaign trail surrogate for Harris, was thoroughly rejected in November by the American people. It turns out that voters didn’t really know what they were signing up for when they embarked on an extended political journey of “hope” and “change.” They weren’t interested — and aren’t interested — in legitimizing the juvenile genital mutilation and chemical castration that has been euphemistically sold as “gender-affirming care.” They weren’t interested — and aren’t interested — in assenting to wide-scale importation and resettlement of foreigners whose cultures and customs are antithetical to our own.\n\nSome leading Democrats do finally seem to get the memo. Former Clinton strategist James Carville, for instance, has called for Democrats to distance themselves from the excesses of woke civilizational arson. But many others disagree. There is no indication at all, for instance, that the ladies of “The View” have done any introspection: Shortly after November’s electoral shellacking, cohost Sunny Hostin attributed Harris’ loss to Donald Trump to “racism” and “misogyny.” Surveying the left-of-center punditocracy scene, it often seems that there are far more Hostin-like voices of escalation than there are Carville-like voices of sobriety.\n\nDemocratic elected officials are also deeply split. California Gov. Gavin Newsom made headlines on Thursday by repudiating certain facets of wokeism during an interview with Charlie Kirk, but congressional Democrats attending Trump’s joint address to Congress on Tuesday evening took the opposite approach, beyond refusing to applaud: Rep. Al Green of Texas obnoxiously heckled the president and was kicked out of the House chamber within the speech’s first few minutes — deservedly so. In general, their conduct was positively buffoonish.\n\nIn what world do Democrats think they do themselves any political favors with these antics and, more important, these underlying substantive political stances? One guest of Trump on Tuesday, Payton McNabb, is a female former high school athlete who was grievously injured during a match against a team with a biological male player. On this issue, recent CNN polling indicates that roughly four-fifths of Americans oppose biological male participation in female athletic competitions. Even Newsom, in his podcast episode with Kirk, called the practice “deeply unfair.”\n\nNewsom seems to be reading the tea leaves — unlike congressional Democrats. There is a similar divide on the issue of illegal immigration and so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions; consider, for instance, New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ high-profile flip on the issue, which has brought him into line with Trump.\n\nTo make matters even worse, a majority of Democratic elites too often now come across not merely as schoolmarmish and excessively self-righteous — but as heartless and lacking compassion, to boot. Party leaders undoubtedly think of themselves as “compassionate,” especially for those perceived as being “oppressed” (on the neo-Marxist intersectional scale of victimization status). But where is the compassion for McNabb? Where is the compassion for the family of Laken Riley, the Athens, Georgia, student whose life was tragically cut short by an illegal alien who never should have been on our soil?\n\nIn order to recover their standing and regain lasting relevance as an electorally feasible national political party, Democrats are going to have to repudiate the entirety of their post-2008/post-Obama cultural legacy. That is the simple truth. The American people want a stable pocketbook, a stable border and a stable world stage. They’re not interested in the Obama-Biden-Harris Democratic Party’s idiosyncratic conception of waging a culture war.\n\nAre Democrats up to such a challenge? The intraparty civil war is on — but I certainly have my doubts. Unless and until they do repudiate their cultural militance, however, Democrats will continue to flounder about in irrelevance. Perhaps they’ll need to get their clocks cleaned at the ballot box a few more times. That wouldn’t be the worst thing.\n\nTo find out more about Josh Hammer and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists, visit the Creators Syndicate website at www.creators.com.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Left on an adult bed, Zachary rolled over and became trapped between the mattress and the footboard. His provider, who had taken a muscle relaxer and was resting on a couch in another room, found him about an hour later.\n\nSeven-month-old Aniyah Boone died of a brain injury and lacerated liver at her child care program in eastern Kansas. Aniyah was left unattended by her caregiver, and when an eight-year-old who was also in care that day tried to take the crying infant out of her crib, the child tripped and dropped Aniyah. When the provider discovered the injuries from the fall, she never tried to perform CPR or call 911.\n\nEighteen-month-old Ava Patrick died within a few hours of being dropped off by her parents for her first day of child care in a suburb of Kansas City. Trapped in a picket fence used to separate sections of the basement space, Ava strangled to death without anyone noticing. An investigation found the center’s owner had 14 children in her care that day—more than double the six she was licensed to supervise.\n\nNationwide, child care deaths are rare, with most states reporting small numbers, if any, each year. But Ava, Aniyah, and Zachary were just three of the 30 children who died in child care programs in Kansas between 2007 and 2009 in accidents that, for the most part, could have been avoided: the consequence of unsafe napping conditions, lack of supervision, or being left with another minor.\n\nThe tragedies spurred the passage of Lexie’s Law in 2010, a state law named for a 13-month-old who died while she was unsupervised on her third day at a home-based child care program, The Hechinger Report explains. The new, stricter requirements for licensing, inspections, and health and safety training catapulted Kansas to the top of the national child care policy rankings. Caregivers there were now required to take more classes in safe-sleep practices, first aid, and child development, and to follow new rules about supervising and monitoring the children in their care.\n\n“Providers have been deemed as a ‘babysitter’ for far too long,” Ava Patrick’s parents wrote in testimony in support of the bill. “We consider the daycare industry a professional industry and it is time that we treated it as such.”\n\nThirteen years later, in 2023, Kansas’s child care system was once again in a state of crisis: The pandemic had decimated the industry. Enrollment numbers had plummeted as parents lost jobs or, fearing illness, pulled their children out of group care, and child care staff had departed in droves, seeking safer, higher--paying jobs. Scores of providers were forced to close, leaving Kansas with scant supply as families gradually sought child care again. In 2023, the state was short 84,000 slots; in 15 counties, there were no openings for infants or toddlers.\n\nFaced with this reality, legislators once again proposed a fix—one, however, that was the precise inverse of the successful approach the state had taken a decade earlier. This time, they proposed deregulating the industry, effectively undoing several aspects of Lexie’s Law and reverting to the notion of child care providers as babysitters. Among their favored solutions: teenagers.\n\nSpecifically, the Republican-dominated Legislature proposed allowing teens as young as 14—two years younger than had been allowed under earlier regulations—to help care for small children. Sixteen-year-olds, previously required to be supervised by an adult, would be able to work unsupervised. Legislators also sought to cut professional development requirements in half for child care workers, from 16 hours a year to eight. And they wanted to give these potentially younger caregivers more children to care for on their own.\n\nThe proposal would “help address the shortage of child care through smart removal of cost--increasing red tape,” testified Elizabeth Patton, state director of Americans for Prosperity Kansas, a conservative advocacy group.\n\nOpponents saw it differently: “It’s terrifyingly dangerous,” said Emily Barnes, who at the time was a home-based child care provider in Olathe, Kansas, with a decade of experience educating young children. “When you’re already working with a workforce that is overworked and underpaid, and the only answer you offer is to just put more work onto them, that’s not going to ensure that anybody is learning, and it will not lead to safe results. People will get hurt.”\n\nThe debate, largely along these lines, continued for eight weeks. Republicans almost universally supported the legislation, while Democrats opposed it. To many, the clear partisan split suggested that this dispute was merely another example of an ideological clash between a Republican-dominated Legislature and a small band of determined Democrats who also happened to be supported by the state’s Democratic leader, a not-unfamiliar scenario in the Midwest in recent years. But to child care experts, it epitomized the nearly diametric views in America on how to repair a broken child care system: One side focused on a quick increase in quantity; the other more concerned about resources and quality.\n\nTo these experts, it felt like the future of American child care—and of American children—was at stake.\n\nKansas, it turns out, was not alone in its push to deregulate child care. While the Sunflower State was busy debating whether to turn teenagers into child care providers, other states were pushing ahead with their own plans to dramatically cut what they perceived as “red tape” in the child care space.\n\nFaced with the end of pandemic aid and more pressure on all fronts—some 16,000 child care providers closed permanently between December 2019 and March 2021—states have been more assertive than ever before in developing their own child care policies. Some states have made promising changes, such as raising wages and establishing benefits for child care staff. But nearly a dozen others are trying to roll back some of the measures known to improve quality and keep children safe and thriving.\n\n“States are looking for a way to avoid the true cost of care and education,” said Annie Dade, a policy analyst at the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at the University of California, Berkeley. “Those that are proposing the solutions are really just insulting the work and value of early educators and looking for another group—in this case, younger workers—to exploit and do this work.”\n\nTurning to teenagers is an increasingly popular solution. In 2022, Iowa passed a law that allowed 16- and 17-year-olds to work with older children in child care centers and increased child-to-staff ratios, allowing one worker to care for seven two-year-olds, up from six, or 10 three-year-olds, up from eight. This year, lawmakers took it further, proposing legislation that would allow those teenagers to care for infants and toddlers alone and unsupervised. In 2023, South Dakota lawmakers slashed training hours for educators, increased child-to-staff ratios, and expanded the role of teens as young as 14 working in both before- and after-school programs.\n\nOther states have focused on deregulating child care by loosening training and licensing requirements as well as oversight. In South Carolina, for instance, a new state law relaxes a requirement that employees of licensed child care programs must have at least six months’ experience working in a licensed facility. And in Utah, unlicensed child care providers can now care for eight children, up from six, without any training or oversight, save for a background check.\n\nEven more states, including Connecticut, Wisconsin, Indiana, Oklahoma, and North Carolina, have slipped deregulation proposals into budgets and legislation with varying success.\n\nFor a time, it looked like the country might be headed in a very different direction. As the pandemic ravaged already beleaguered centers across the country, the federal government stepped in with $24 billion in aid. It was a rare influx that offered programs some much-needed breathing room. For the first time, they had extra money to raise teacher salaries, provide bonus and retention pay, cover expenses and stave off program closures. And once Joe Biden arrived at the White House, it seemed that the government might go even farther by making pandemic relief aid permanent. That is essentially what happened in Canada, where in 2021 leaders committed $30 billion over five years to the country’s first federally funded child care system.\n\nBut in the United States, that wasn’t to be. Weeks after the House passed the Build Back Better Act—which had included $400 billion over 10 years for universal pre-K and affordable child care—West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin withdrew his support, effectively killing the bill. Its successor, the Inflation Reduction Act, which came up for a vote nearly a year later, set aside no funds for child care. The pandemic relief funds ran out in mid-2023.\n\nA few states have tried to pick up the slack. In 2022, for example, New Mexico changed its constitution to permanently funnel oil and gas money into early childhood programs. In 2023, Vermont established a new payroll tax to help fund child care. But instead of investing more to support qualified workers and promote safe, high-quality care, many states have been going in the opposite direction: They’ve begun embracing laws that are dangerously detached from what’s needed and that fly in the face of decades of research showing what young children need to stay safe, to learn, and to thrive.\n\nKristen O’Shea, a Republican state senator in Kansas, learned about the child care crisis the same way most parents do: She couldn’t find full-time care for her infant son. For six months in 2022, O’Shea cobbled together multiple arrangements, including using family and friends, members of her church, neighbors, and a nanny she found online.\n\nIn researching the issue, O’Shea told me, she discovered that Kansas’s child care ratio for infants—three babies to one staff member—is one of the lowest in the nation, and she concluded that it’s unnecessarily strict. “Are there that many more infant deaths in other states?” she asked, before answering her own question: “I think you’d be hearing about that in the news, and you’re not.”\n\nThis research, combined with her personal frustration over the shortage, compelled O’Shea to co-write a 2023 bill that proposed bringing teens into care facilities and classrooms, among other changes. Child care operators will more easily grow and flourish, O’Shea argued, when the government steps aside and programs are no longer hampered by “crazy regulations.”\n\nThe belief that teenagers can’t play a role in caring for infants and toddlers is rooted in “ageism,” she added. “You can’t say a 14-year-old is not going to be as good as a 65-year-old.”\n\nOther proponents of deregulation largely echoed O’Shea, arguing that the looser requirements could get more children into licensed programs and keep them out of potentially more dangerous, unlicensed settings. Meanwhile, most Democrats and experts on early childhood argued that deregulation would lower the quality of care and endanger young children. They warned that the law would walk Kansas back in time.\n\nAshley Goss, Kansas’s deputy secretary for public health, testified that it would reverse vital aspects of Lexie’s Law. “As written, this bill fails to consider national health and safety standards which are critical to children’s health,” Goss wrote.\n\n“It’s really about cramming more children in a smaller space and having them supervised by less well-trained staff,” argued Democratic state Sen. Ethan Corson during the debate. The proposal would pack kids “in there like sardines, as many as we can, with less-qualified staff.”\n\nSeveral providers who spoke said they wouldn’t even consider taking advantage of the looser regulations. “I would never accept four infants in care by myself,” wrote Tiffany Mannes, a family child care provider in Overland Park, outside Kansas City, who has worked in the field for more than two decades. “To be frank, there are children’s lives on the line …. These changes would cause lower-quality care in a best case scenario and possibly injury or even death in a worst case scenario.”\n\nDespite such impassioned testimony, in April 2023, 14 years after Ava Patrick died at her child care program, the Kansas Legislature passed the deregulation bill overwhelmingly. The tally—77 in favor, 46 opposed—fell almost completely along party lines. The bill was on its way to becoming law. But when it was sent eight days later to Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, she promptly vetoed it.\n\nParents need access “to safe, affordable, quality child care,” Kelly said in a statement announcing her decision. “This bill would reverse the progress we’ve made toward that goal…. While I agree it’s time to review our child care policies, we must do it together—and in a way that improves, not harms, our state’s ability to help families and keep kids safe.”\n\nThe governor’s veto might have ended, or at least paused, the battle over child care in Kansas, shutting it down indefinitely. But the bill’s backers were not ready to give up. So, instead, the veto set up the state for an ongoing tug-of-war.\n\nDuring the legislative debate in Kansas, the opponents of deregulation focused, for the most part, on safety. Providers like Tiffany Mannes testified elo-quently about the dangers they foresaw if child-to-staff ratios were increased. But among national experts who have been watching the push for deregulation that is taking place across the country, there is an additional concern—one that goes beyond safety to the broader question of quality.\n\nDecades of research, experts explained in more than 20 interviews, show why quality child care—care that prioritizes low child-to-staff ratios, caregiver experience, and a stimulating environment—matters. Inside a child’s brain are billions of neurons, which form connections with other neurons and ultimately create pathways for various brain functions. In the time it takes to read this sentence, a baby’s brain will create around nine million new neural connections, including sensory pathways that help with vision and hearing, as well as language skills and other complex cognitive functions.\n\nThe experiences and environments of young children determine which neural pathways become stronger and which become weaker.\n\n“This is a really sensitive time to get it right for kids. They need safe, stable, nurturing environments and responsive caregiving,” said Rahil Briggs, a clinical professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and the national director of HealthySteps, a pediatric health care program.\n\nRight now, child care providers in the United States are struggling to meet these needs. While there are plenty of loving caregivers who engage children in thoughtful interactions in safe settings, studies show that, overall, child care quality is low in the United States. A seminal 2006 study funded by the federal government estimated that only 10% of child care programs provide kids with “very high quality” care. More recent research suggests that quality not only remains a problem but is also wildly uneven, especially when it comes to children from low-income families.\n\nMany children spend their days in “language isolation,” experts report, deprived of adequate interactions with caregivers. For decades, children have simply been surviving their care, not thriving in it. And, once again, COVID-19only exacerbated the problem: Nearly 45% of child care providers said the quality of the care they offer has been affected by pandemic--related stressors, according to a survey earlier this year for The Hechinger Report by RAPID, a project of the Stanford Center on Early Childhood.\n\n“We have many children in settings which may look fine, but where they are just completely ignored,” said Bridget Hamre, the CEO of Teachstone, an organization that developed an early-childhood classroom scoring system, which she helped create.\n\nIn sounding these alarms, experts were careful not to fault providers, many of whom work long hours in a physically and emotionally demanding job despite making poverty wages. In the majority of states, more than 15% of child care workers live in poverty, and many have trouble paying for basic needs like food and housing. Nearly half use public assistance.\n\nThese conditions have led to a revolving door for caregivers. More than half of the directors of child care centers and owners of family child care services report staffing shortages. Thus far, however, the trend in many state legislatures has not been to push for more funding to boost wages or bolster training, but to strip the sector of some of its most effective guardrails.\n\nAt 9:30 am on a Wednesday morning earlier this year, Kay Strahorn’s alarm went off on her phone, alerting her that it was time to give asthma medicine to one of the toddlers at the child care program she directs in Iowa. Strahorn quickly weaved her way through the building to the Panda classroom, where she carefully pushed open the door and greeted the two teachers inside. “The dream team,” she whispered as she slipped her shoes off and stepped inside the room.\n\nIn Iowa, weakened regulations, including looser child-to-staff ratios and allowing teenagers in classrooms, have been in place for two years. For Strahorn, who runs Conmigo Early Education Center in Des Moines, where the top of the state capitol building’s gold dome is visible from the playground, the new regulations have done nothing to help expand capacity or ease the staffing crunch. Strahorn refuses to raise ratios. Not only would quality take a hit, she said, but “it’s not safe for the kids” and “it’s more work for the teachers.”\n\n“These teachers are already doing so much work,” she added.\n\nStrahorn has employed 17-year-olds, but in a limited capacity as teacher aides. The teenagers are never alone with the children and don’t change diapers. Even though it is allowed by the state, Strahorn would never hire teens as sole caregivers, she told me. What Conmigo really needs, she said, is money to raise wages so that she can retain her best teachers—people like Andrea Nieto and Brittany Brown, the dream team.\n\nStrahorn knew within moments of starting Brown’s interview that she had the right temperament to care for and educate children. Brown showed up at the child care center with her infant daughter, and when her daughter became fussy during the interview, Brown was unshaken. She stood up and gently started to bounce the infant while answering interview questions, without missing a beat.\n\nIowans have made it clear that the direction that the Legislature took doesn’t reflect their wishes: 65% of those surveyed in 2022 said they don’t want teens working unsupervised in child care programs. But a not--insignificant number of providers are taking advantage of the new rules. Following the 2022 legislation, 42% of providers surveyed in Iowa said they had increased child-to-staff ratios in their 2- and 3-year-old classrooms; a majority of those providers said the increased flexibility helped relieve staffing burdens. The law also allows 16- and 17-year-olds to care for school-age children unsupervised in child care settings; about half of child care programs report having done so.\n\nStill, Iowa’s child care providers continue to close their doors, suggesting that the measures aren’t leading to the revival lawmakers had hoped for. The decline has been significant enough that even some state officials have noted that the new legislation does little to address the desperate need for experienced caregivers, especially after the social disruption caused by the pandemic.\n\nIn recent years, child care programs have seen an increase in disruptive behavior among children, as well as in undesirable behavior from staff, such as yelling or roughly pulling youngsters’ arms, said Ryan Page, the director of child care for the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services. “When you’ve got high turnover and under-trained staff, they’re not knowing how to manage some of the behaviors,” she added.\n\nIn at least one documented case, the caregiver’s age was noted as a factor in an abuse complaint. In 2023, the year after the Iowa legislation passed, a teenager working in a child care program was accused of hitting a child in her care, pulling a child’s arm, and swearing. An investigation found that the teen told the child’s mother, another teacher at the child care program, that she was “a crackhead” and had no control over her own children. In a report on the investigation, an Iowa official wrote, “It is in the best interest of the center for [the teen] to take [a] break until she is mature enough to work here.”\n\nStrahorn told me that the legislation hasn’t made it easier to find qualified, experienced teachers in Iowa. “There was no more money attached to it,” she said of the new law. “We can’t pay our teachers any more money,” and it’s not fair to simply make their job harder, she added.\n\nRather than add to teachers’ workload or hire someone younger or unqualified, Strahorn stepped in as a lead pre-K teacher, in addition to her director role, for the entirety of the last school year while waiting for someone qualified to apply. Part of the problem is the pay Conmigo can offer: Wages at the center start at $12 an hour for teacher aides and $14 an hour for lead teachers—about the same as the state’s median hourly wage for child care workers, but still not enough to attract enough highly qualified staff.\n\nSome early learning experts in Iowa are optimistic about small efforts in the state that directly target issues like low pay and retention. A state program that financially rewards early childhood educators who increase their education level has had impressive results: 85% of participants have stayed in the field, and nearly all said it has eased financial stress. And under a 2023 pilot program, child care workers are now eligible for financial assistance to help pay for their own child care costs. Iowa also has invested in programs that ease the burdens of running a business, Page told me, including providing financial consulting and paying for child care management software.\n\nBut despite the promise of these initiatives, the Republican majority in the Legislature remains focused on deregulation. During this year’s session, they proposed allowing teenagers to care for infants and toddlers unsupervised. While a modestly amended version (tailored to address fierce resistance from child care advocates and experts) ultimately failed to progress beyond the House, Iowa child care experts have no illusions that the fight is over. They expect more deregulation efforts in the future.\n\nDuring the brief but frenzied final stretch of the presidential campaign, many child care advocates saw Vice President Kamala Harris as the best chance for more federal investment in child care—and with it, a meaningful counterweight to the deregulation movement. Harris spoke frequently of her plans for a “care economy,” which included a proposal to cap child care costs at 7% of a working family’s income, and called for child care providers to “receive the wages that they deserve based on the dignity of their work.” These plans followed some imperfect yet notable child care policy strides made during the Biden administration, including new federal rules that lowered the cost of care for military families and low--income families.\n\nWith the election of Donald Trump and JD Vance, the prospects for a renewed national commitment to quality, affordable child care have dimmed considerably. Now, child care advocates are gearing up to fight for federal resources from a deeply conservative administration that has not only signaled hostility toward federally funded programs but also made deregulation a cornerstone of its agenda. Project 2025, a blueprint for a second Trump administration organized by the Heritage Foundation, calls for the elimination of the Office of Head Start, which oversees federally funded early -learning programs that serve more than 800,000 low--income children. It also directs the administration to prioritize funding for military families and “familial, in-home” care, including money for stay-at-home parents.\n\nTrump’s first term in office offers some additional insights into what we might expect. During his first go-round, Trump proposed cuts to the Child Care and Development Block Grant, a federal program that helps low--income families afford care. (Congress ultimately passed increases to the program, which Trump signed off on.) Although Trump then provided $3.5 billion in relief to the program during the pandemic, his child care policy approach has since focused largely on reducing costs for families through tax credits, without addressing the operating and staffing costs that are major barriers for programs.\n\nFor his part, Vance has devoted considerably more time to the topic of child care, but largely along lines that are hostile to robust government support. Vance is a vocal opponent of formal, publicly funded child care. In 2021, he wrote on X that “‘Universal day care’ is a class war against normal people.” During this year’s vice presidential debate, he acknowledged that the government may need to spend more money on child care but said that money should go toward informal care arrangements.\n\nVance also has suggested that regulations are to blame for child care staffing shortages, claiming in a September interview with far-right Turning Points USA founder Charlie Kirk that there are plenty of people who want to work in child care, but that “the state government says you’re not allowed to take care of children unless you have some ridiculous certification that has nothing to do … with taking care of kids.” (It was unclear what Vance was referring to, as the only formal certification required of child care staff in licensed settings is typically in first aid and CPR.)\n\nVance also appeared to blame the staffing challenges that providers are facing on education requirements for child care teachers. “Don’t force every early child care specialist to go and get a six-year college degree,” Vance told Kirk. (No state requires anything close to that level of education to work in child care.)\n\nThe similarity of such arguments to those advanced by pro-deregulation politicians suggests just how strongly their goals will be aligned over these next four years. The Trump-Vance administration almost certainly will fan the flames of the child care deregulation movement at both the state and national levels. And while there is little evidence that the states that have moved toward deregulation have seen positive changes on the ground — many parents are still unable to find care, and providers are still shutting down — that hasn’t curbed the deregulatory zeal of many politicians. In Kansas, as elsewhere, the push continues.\n\nThis spring, in Kansas, Republican lawmakers once again brought forward a series of deregulation measures. Although they made no mention of 14-year-olds this time, they did propose increasing child-to-staff ratios as well as the maximum number of children who can be cared for by one provider in home-based settings—those settings where the majority of child deaths have occurred.\n\nAfter several revisions, the proposed legislation died, but that didn’t stop the Republican majority in the Legislature from asserting its will: In April, lawmakers passed the final state budget, which was stripped of most of the $56 million in funding that Gov. Kelly was seeking for child care.\n\nAlso this spring, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment completed a lengthy process of changing regulations on its own, including some easing of child care ratios. The new regulations were approved by the Republican state attorney general and took effect in early August.\n\n“Do I think they went far enough? No, and they know that,” said Sen. O’Shea, referring to the state’s efforts. “But it’s a step in the right direction.” It remains unclear whether Republican legislators will try to push for more deregulation in the upcoming term. In late April, O’Shea announced she would not run for reelection.\n\nOn the federal level, experts question whether lawmakers will ever give the child care industry the funding it needs to solve the problems that states are trying to solve on their own. Sonya Michel, a child care historian, told me she’s pessimistic that America will ever adequately fund child care. “Given the political polarization and our lack of a history or tradition of social democratic support for public social service … I don’t see that happening,” she said. “It’s hard to see where the impetus would come from at this point.”\n\nMeanwhile, in child care programs around the country, America’s children are already in the midst of their most critical days of brain development, their brains rapidly producing new neurons. Regardless of which circuits of the brain are strengthened and which are not, lawmakers will continue to debate how much of our money and attention the early years are deserving of, and then pass children along to schools where many teachers will attempt to solve the very problems that didn’t need to be created in the first place.\n\nSara Hutchinson contributed research to this story.\n\nThis story also appeared in The Nation.\n\nThis story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, and reviewed and distributed by Stacker.","summary":"States have been more assertive than ever before in developing their own child care policies.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/03/09/american-child-care-future/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-627403956.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 13:10:30","author":"Stacker","authors":["Stacker"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.6},{"id":298328680,"title":"The dark future of American child care","text":"By Jackie Mader for The Hechinger Report\n\nZachary David Typer was six months old when he suffocated after being put down for a nap by his child care provider in Topeka, Kansas. Left on an adult bed, Zachary rolled over and became trapped between the mattress and the footboard. His provider, who had taken a muscle relaxer and was resting on a couch in another room, found him about an hour later.\n\nSeven-month-old Aniyah Boone died of a brain injury and lacerated liver at her child care program in eastern Kansas. Aniyah was left unattended by her caregiver, and when an eight-year-old who was also in care that day tried to take the crying infant out of her crib, the child tripped and dropped Aniyah. When the provider discovered the injuries from the fall, she never tried to perform CPR or call 911.\n\nEighteen-month-old Ava Patrick died within a few hours of being dropped off by her parents for her first day of child care in a suburb of Kansas City. Trapped in a picket fence used to separate sections of the basement space, Ava strangled to death without anyone noticing. An investigation found the center’s owner had 14 children in her care that day—more than double the six she was licensed to supervise.\n\nNationwide, child care deaths are rare, with most states reporting small numbers, if any, each year. But Ava, Aniyah, and Zachary were just three of the 30 children who died in child care programs in Kansas between 2007 and 2009 in accidents that, for the most part, could have been avoided: the consequence of unsafe napping conditions, lack of supervision, or being left with another minor.\n\nThe tragedies spurred the passage of Lexie’s Law in 2010, a state law named for a 13-month-old who died while she was unsupervised on her third day at a home-based child care program, The Hechinger Report explains. The new, stricter requirements for licensing, inspections, and health and safety training catapulted Kansas to the top of the national child care policy rankings. Caregivers there were now required to take more classes in safe-sleep practices, first aid, and child development, and to follow new rules about supervising and monitoring the children in their care.\n\n“Providers have been deemed as a ‘babysitter’ for far too long,” Ava Patrick’s parents wrote in testimony in support of the bill. “We consider the daycare industry a professional industry and it is time that we treated it as such.”\n\nThirteen years later, in 2023, Kansas’s child care system was once again in a state of crisis: The pandemic had decimated the industry. Enrollment numbers had plummeted as parents lost jobs or, fearing illness, pulled their children out of group care, and child care staff had departed in droves, seeking safer, higher--paying jobs. Scores of providers were forced to close, leaving Kansas with scant supply as families gradually sought child care again. In 2023, the state was short 84,000 slots; in 15 counties, there were no openings for infants or toddlers.\n\nFaced with this reality, legislators once again proposed a fix—one, however, that was the precise inverse of the successful approach the state had taken a decade earlier. This time, they proposed deregulating the industry, effectively undoing several aspects of Lexie’s Law and reverting to the notion of child care providers as babysitters. Among their favored solutions: teenagers.\n\nSpecifically, the Republican-dominated Legislature proposed allowing teens as young as 14—two years younger than had been allowed under earlier regulations—to help care for small children. Sixteen-year-olds, previously required to be supervised by an adult, would be able to work unsupervised. Legislators also sought to cut professional development requirements in half for child care workers, from 16 hours a year to eight. And they wanted to give these potentially younger caregivers more children to care for on their own.\n\nThe proposal would “help address the shortage of child care through smart removal of cost--increasing red tape,” testified Elizabeth Patton, state director of Americans for Prosperity Kansas, a conservative advocacy group.\n\nOpponents saw it differently: “It’s terrifyingly dangerous,” said Emily Barnes, who at the time was a home-based child care provider in Olathe, Kansas, with a decade of experience educating young children. “When you’re already working with a workforce that is overworked and underpaid, and the only answer you offer is to just put more work onto them, that’s not going to ensure that anybody is learning, and it will not lead to safe results. People will get hurt.”\n\nThe debate, largely along these lines, continued for eight weeks. Republicans almost universally supported the legislation, while Democrats opposed it. To many, the clear partisan split suggested that this dispute was merely another example of an ideological clash between a Republican-dominated Legislature and a small band of determined Democrats who also happened to be supported by the state’s Democratic leader, a not-unfamiliar scenario in the Midwest in recent years. But to child care experts, it epitomized the nearly diametric views in America on how to repair a broken child care system: One side focused on a quick increase in quantity; the other more concerned about resources and quality.\n\nTo these experts, it felt like the future of American child care—and of American children—was at stake.\n\nKansas, it turns out, was not alone in its push to deregulate child care. While the Sunflower State was busy debating whether to turn teenagers into child care providers, other states were pushing ahead with their own plans to dramatically cut what they perceived as “red tape” in the child care space.\n\nFaced with the end of pandemic aid and more pressure on all fronts—some 16,000 child care providers closed permanently between December 2019 and March 2021—states have been more assertive than ever before in developing their own child care policies. Some states have made promising changes, such as raising wages and establishing benefits for child care staff. But nearly a dozen others are trying to roll back some of the measures known to improve quality and keep children safe and thriving.\n\n“States are looking for a way to avoid the true cost of care and education,” said Annie Dade, a policy analyst at the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at the University of California, Berkeley. “Those that are proposing the solutions are really just insulting the work and value of early educators and looking for another group—in this case, younger workers—to exploit and do this work.”\n\nTurning to teenagers is an increasingly popular solution. In 2022, Iowa passed a law that allowed 16- and 17-year-olds to work with older children in child care centers and increased child-to-staff ratios, allowing one worker to care for seven two-year-olds, up from six, or 10 three-year-olds, up from eight. This year, lawmakers took it further, proposing legislation that would allow those teenagers to care for infants and toddlers alone and unsupervised. In 2023, South Dakota lawmakers slashed training hours for educators, increased child-to-staff ratios, and expanded the role of teens as young as 14 working in both before- and after-school programs.\n\nOther states have focused on deregulating child care by loosening training and licensing requirements as well as oversight. In South Carolina, for instance, a new state law relaxes a requirement that employees of licensed child care programs must have at least six months’ experience working in a licensed facility. And in Utah, unlicensed child care providers can now care for eight children, up from six, without any training or oversight, save for a background check.\n\nEven more states, including Connecticut, Wisconsin, Indiana, Oklahoma, and North Carolina, have slipped deregulation proposals into budgets and legislation with varying success.\n\nFor a time, it looked like the country might be headed in a very different direction. As the pandemic ravaged already beleaguered centers across the country, the federal government stepped in with $24 billion in aid. It was a rare influx that offered programs some much-needed breathing room. For the first time, they had extra money to raise teacher salaries, provide bonus and retention pay, cover expenses and stave off program closures. And once Joe Biden arrived at the White House, it seemed that the government might go even farther by making pandemic relief aid permanent. That is essentially what happened in Canada, where in 2021 leaders committed $30 billion over five years to the country’s first federally funded child care system.\n\nBut in the United States, that wasn’t to be. Weeks after the House passed the Build Back Better Act—which had included $400 billion over 10 years for universal pre-K and affordable child care—West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin withdrew his support, effectively killing the bill. Its successor, the Inflation Reduction Act, which came up for a vote nearly a year later, set aside no funds for child care. The pandemic relief funds ran out in mid-2023.\n\nA few states have tried to pick up the slack. In 2022, for example, New Mexico changed its constitution to permanently funnel oil and gas money into early childhood programs. In 2023, Vermont established a new payroll tax to help fund child care. But instead of investing more to support qualified workers and promote safe, high-quality care, many states have been going in the opposite direction: They’ve begun embracing laws that are dangerously detached from what’s needed and that fly in the face of decades of research showing what young children need to stay safe, to learn, and to thrive.\n\nKristen O’Shea, a Republican state senator in Kansas, learned about the child care crisis the same way most parents do: She couldn’t find full-time care for her infant son. For six months in 2022, O’Shea cobbled together multiple arrangements, including using family and friends, members of her church, neighbors, and a nanny she found online.\n\nIn researching the issue, O’Shea told me, she discovered that Kansas’s child care ratio for infants—three babies to one staff member—is one of the lowest in the nation, and she concluded that it’s unnecessarily strict. “Are there that many more infant deaths in other states?” she asked, before answering her own question: “I think you’d be hearing about that in the news, and you’re not.”\n\nThis research, combined with her personal frustration over the shortage, compelled O’Shea to co-write a 2023 bill that proposed bringing teens into care facilities and classrooms, among other changes. Child care operators will more easily grow and flourish, O’Shea argued, when the government steps aside and programs are no longer hampered by “crazy regulations.”\n\nThe belief that teenagers can’t play a role in caring for infants and toddlers is rooted in “ageism,” she added. “You can’t say a 14-year-old is not going to be as good as a 65-year-old.”\n\nOther proponents of deregulation largely echoed O’Shea, arguing that the looser requirements could get more children into licensed programs and keep them out of potentially more dangerous, unlicensed settings. Meanwhile, most Democrats and experts on early childhood argued that deregulation would lower the quality of care and endanger young children. They warned that the law would walk Kansas back in time.\n\nAshley Goss, Kansas’s deputy secretary for public health, testified that it would reverse vital aspects of Lexie’s Law. “As written, this bill fails to consider national health and safety standards which are critical to children’s health,” Goss wrote.\n\n“It’s really about cramming more children in a smaller space and having them supervised by less well-trained staff,” argued Democratic state Sen. Ethan Corson during the debate. The proposal would pack kids “in there like sardines, as many as we can, with less-qualified staff.”\n\nSeveral providers who spoke said they wouldn’t even consider taking advantage of the looser regulations. “I would never accept four infants in care by myself,” wrote Tiffany Mannes, a family child care provider in Overland Park, outside Kansas City, who has worked in the field for more than two decades. “To be frank, there are children’s lives on the line …. These changes would cause lower-quality care in a best case scenario and possibly injury or even death in a worst case scenario.”\n\nDespite such impassioned testimony, in April 2023, 14 years after Ava Patrick died at her child care program, the Kansas Legislature passed the deregulation bill overwhelmingly. The tally—77 in favor, 46 opposed—fell almost completely along party lines. The bill was on its way to becoming law. But when it was sent eight days later to Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, she promptly vetoed it.\n\nParents need access “to safe, affordable, quality child care,” Kelly said in a statement announcing her decision. “This bill would reverse the progress we’ve made toward that goal…. While I agree it’s time to review our child care policies, we must do it together—and in a way that improves, not harms, our state’s ability to help families and keep kids safe.”\n\nThe governor’s veto might have ended, or at least paused, the battle over child care in Kansas, shutting it down indefinitely. But the bill’s backers were not ready to give up. So, instead, the veto set up the state for an ongoing tug-of-war.\n\nDuring the legislative debate in Kansas, the opponents of deregulation focused, for the most part, on safety. Providers like Tiffany Mannes testified elo-quently about the dangers they foresaw if child-to-staff ratios were increased. But among national experts who have been watching the push for deregulation that is taking place across the country, there is an additional concern—one that goes beyond safety to the broader question of quality.\n\nDecades of research, experts explained in more than 20 interviews, show why quality child care—care that prioritizes low child-to-staff ratios, caregiver experience, and a stimulating environment—matters. Inside a child’s brain are billions of neurons, which form connections with other neurons and ultimately create pathways for various brain functions. In the time it takes to read this sentence, a baby’s brain will create around nine million new neural connections, including sensory pathways that help with vision and hearing, as well as language skills and other complex cognitive functions.\n\nThe experiences and environments of young children determine which neural pathways become stronger and which become weaker.\n\n“This is a really sensitive time to get it right for kids. They need safe, stable, nurturing environments and responsive caregiving,” said Rahil Briggs, a clinical professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and the national director of HealthySteps, a pediatric health care program.\n\nRight now, child care providers in the United States are struggling to meet these needs. While there are plenty of loving caregivers who engage children in thoughtful interactions in safe settings, studies show that, overall, child care quality is low in the United States. A seminal 2006 study funded by the federal government estimated that only 10% of child care programs provide kids with “very high quality” care. More recent research suggests that quality not only remains a problem but is also wildly uneven, especially when it comes to children from low-income families.\n\nMany children spend their days in “language isolation,” experts report, deprived of adequate interactions with caregivers. For decades, children have simply been surviving their care, not thriving in it. And, once again, COVID-19only exacerbated the problem: Nearly 45% of child care providers said the quality of the care they offer has been affected by pandemic--related stressors, according to a survey earlier this year for The Hechinger Report by RAPID, a project of the Stanford Center on Early Childhood.\n\n“We have many children in settings which may look fine, but where they are just completely ignored,” said Bridget Hamre, the CEO of Teachstone, an organization that developed an early-childhood classroom scoring system, which she helped create.\n\nIn sounding these alarms, experts were careful not to fault providers, many of whom work long hours in a physically and emotionally demanding job despite making poverty wages. In the majority of states, more than 15% of child care workers live in poverty, and many have trouble paying for basic needs like food and housing. Nearly half use public assistance.\n\nThese conditions have led to a revolving door for caregivers. More than half of the directors of child care centers and owners of family child care services report staffing shortages. Thus far, however, the trend in many state legislatures has not been to push for more funding to boost wages or bolster training, but to strip the sector of some of its most effective guardrails.\n\nAt 9:30 am on a Wednesday morning earlier this year, Kay Strahorn’s alarm went off on her phone, alerting her that it was time to give asthma medicine to one of the toddlers at the child care program she directs in Iowa. Strahorn quickly weaved her way through the building to the Panda classroom, where she carefully pushed open the door and greeted the two teachers inside. “The dream team,” she whispered as she slipped her shoes off and stepped inside the room.\n\nIn Iowa, weakened regulations, including looser child-to-staff ratios and allowing teenagers in classrooms, have been in place for two years. For Strahorn, who runs Conmigo Early Education Center in Des Moines, where the top of the state capitol building’s gold dome is visible from the playground, the new regulations have done nothing to help expand capacity or ease the staffing crunch. Strahorn refuses to raise ratios. Not only would quality take a hit, she said, but “it’s not safe for the kids” and “it’s more work for the teachers.”\n\n“These teachers are already doing so much work,” she added.\n\nStrahorn has employed 17-year-olds, but in a limited capacity as teacher aides. The teenagers are never alone with the children and don’t change diapers. Even though it is allowed by the state, Strahorn would never hire teens as sole caregivers, she told me. What Conmigo really needs, she said, is money to raise wages so that she can retain her best teachers—people like Andrea Nieto and Brittany Brown, the dream team.\n\nStrahorn knew within moments of starting Brown’s interview that she had the right temperament to care for and educate children. Brown showed up at the child care center with her infant daughter, and when her daughter became fussy during the interview, Brown was unshaken. She stood up and gently started to bounce the infant while answering interview questions, without missing a beat.\n\nIowans have made it clear that the direction that the Legislature took doesn’t reflect their wishes: 65% of those surveyed in 2022 said they don’t want teens working unsupervised in child care programs. But a not--insignificant number of providers are taking advantage of the new rules. Following the 2022 legislation, 42% of providers surveyed in Iowa said they had increased child-to-staff ratios in their 2- and 3-year-old classrooms; a majority of those providers said the increased flexibility helped relieve staffing burdens. The law also allows 16- and 17-year-olds to care for school-age children unsupervised in child care settings; about half of child care programs report having done so.\n\nStill, Iowa’s child care providers continue to close their doors, suggesting that the measures aren’t leading to the revival lawmakers had hoped for. The decline has been significant enough that even some state officials have noted that the new legislation does little to address the desperate need for experienced caregivers, especially after the social disruption caused by the pandemic.\n\nIn recent years, child care programs have seen an increase in disruptive behavior among children, as well as in undesirable behavior from staff, such as yelling or roughly pulling youngsters’ arms, said Ryan Page, the director of child care for the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services. “When you’ve got high turnover and under-trained staff, they’re not knowing how to manage some of the behaviors,” she added.\n\nIn at least one documented case, the caregiver’s age was noted as a factor in an abuse complaint. In 2023, the year after the Iowa legislation passed, a teenager working in a child care program was accused of hitting a child in her care, pulling a child’s arm, and swearing. An investigation found that the teen told the child’s mother, another teacher at the child care program, that she was “a crackhead” and had no control over her own children. In a report on the investigation, an Iowa official wrote, “It is in the best interest of the center for [the teen] to take [a] break until she is mature enough to work here.”\n\nStrahorn told me that the legislation hasn’t made it easier to find qualified, experienced teachers in Iowa. “There was no more money attached to it,” she said of the new law. “We can’t pay our teachers any more money,” and it’s not fair to simply make their job harder, she added.\n\nRather than add to teachers’ workload or hire someone younger or unqualified, Strahorn stepped in as a lead pre-K teacher, in addition to her director role, for the entirety of the last school year while waiting for someone qualified to apply. Part of the problem is the pay Conmigo can offer: Wages at the center start at $12 an hour for teacher aides and $14 an hour for lead teachers—about the same as the state’s median hourly wage for child care workers, but still not enough to attract enough highly qualified staff.\n\nSome early learning experts in Iowa are optimistic about small efforts in the state that directly target issues like low pay and retention. A state program that financially rewards early childhood educators who increase their education level has had impressive results: 85% of participants have stayed in the field, and nearly all said it has eased financial stress. And under a 2023 pilot program, child care workers are now eligible for financial assistance to help pay for their own child care costs. Iowa also has invested in programs that ease the burdens of running a business, Page told me, including providing financial consulting and paying for child care management software.\n\nBut despite the promise of these initiatives, the Republican majority in the Legislature remains focused on deregulation. During this year’s session, they proposed allowing teenagers to care for infants and toddlers unsupervised. While a modestly amended version (tailored to address fierce resistance from child care advocates and experts) ultimately failed to progress beyond the House, Iowa child care experts have no illusions that the fight is over. They expect more deregulation efforts in the future.\n\nDuring the brief but frenzied final stretch of the presidential campaign, many child care advocates saw Vice President Kamala Harris as the best chance for more federal investment in child care—and with it, a meaningful counterweight to the deregulation movement. Harris spoke frequently of her plans for a “care economy,” which included a proposal to cap child care costs at 7% of a working family’s income, and called for child care providers to “receive the wages that they deserve based on the dignity of their work.” These plans followed some imperfect yet notable child care policy strides made during the Biden administration, including new federal rules that lowered the cost of care for military families and low--income families.\n\nWith the election of Donald Trump and JD Vance, the prospects for a renewed national commitment to quality, affordable child care have dimmed considerably. Now, child care advocates are gearing up to fight for federal resources from a deeply conservative administration that has not only signaled hostility toward federally funded programs but also made deregulation a cornerstone of its agenda. Project 2025, a blueprint for a second Trump administration organized by the Heritage Foundation, calls for the elimination of the Office of Head Start, which oversees federally funded early -learning programs that serve more than 800,000 low--income children. It also directs the administration to prioritize funding for military families and “familial, in-home” care, including money for stay-at-home parents.\n\nTrump’s first term in office offers some additional insights into what we might expect. During his first go-round, Trump proposed cuts to the Child Care and Development Block Grant, a federal program that helps low--income families afford care. (Congress ultimately passed increases to the program, which Trump signed off on.) Although Trump then provided $3.5 billion in relief to the program during the pandemic, his child care policy approach has since focused largely on reducing costs for families through tax credits, without addressing the operating and staffing costs that are major barriers for programs.\n\nFor his part, Vance has devoted considerably more time to the topic of child care, but largely along lines that are hostile to robust government support. Vance is a vocal opponent of formal, publicly funded child care. In 2021, he wrote on X that “‘Universal day care’ is a class war against normal people.” During this year’s vice presidential debate, he acknowledged that the government may need to spend more money on child care but said that money should go toward informal care arrangements.\n\nVance also has suggested that regulations are to blame for child care staffing shortages, claiming in a September interview with far-right Turning Points USA founder Charlie Kirk that there are plenty of people who want to work in child care, but that “the state government says you’re not allowed to take care of children unless you have some ridiculous certification that has nothing to do … with taking care of kids.” (It was unclear what Vance was referring to, as the only formal certification required of child care staff in licensed settings is typically in first aid and CPR.)\n\nVance also appeared to blame the staffing challenges that providers are facing on education requirements for child care teachers. “Don’t force every early child care specialist to go and get a six-year college degree,” Vance told Kirk. (No state requires anything close to that level of education to work in child care.)\n\nThe similarity of such arguments to those advanced by pro-deregulation politicians suggests just how strongly their goals will be aligned over these next four years. The Trump-Vance administration almost certainly will fan the flames of the child care deregulation movement at both the state and national levels. And while there is little evidence that the states that have moved toward deregulation have seen positive changes on the ground — many parents are still unable to find care, and providers are still shutting down — that hasn’t curbed the deregulatory zeal of many politicians. In Kansas, as elsewhere, the push continues.\n\nThis spring, in Kansas, Republican lawmakers once again brought forward a series of deregulation measures. Although they made no mention of 14-year-olds this time, they did propose increasing child-to-staff ratios as well as the maximum number of children who can be cared for by one provider in home-based settings—those settings where the majority of child deaths have occurred.\n\nAfter several revisions, the proposed legislation died, but that didn’t stop the Republican majority in the Legislature from asserting its will: In April, lawmakers passed the final state budget, which was stripped of most of the $56 million in funding that Gov. Kelly was seeking for child care.\n\nAlso this spring, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment completed a lengthy process of changing regulations on its own, including some easing of child care ratios. The new regulations were approved by the Republican state attorney general and took effect in early August.\n\n“Do I think they went far enough? No, and they know that,” said Sen. O’Shea, referring to the state’s efforts. “But it’s a step in the right direction.” It remains unclear whether Republican legislators will try to push for more deregulation in the upcoming term. In late April, O’Shea announced she would not run for reelection.\n\nOn the federal level, experts question whether lawmakers will ever give the child care industry the funding it needs to solve the problems that states are trying to solve on their own. Sonya Michel, a child care historian, told me she’s pessimistic that America will ever adequately fund child care. “Given the political polarization and our lack of a history or tradition of social democratic support for public social service … I don’t see that happening,” she said. “It’s hard to see where the impetus would come from at this point.”\n\nMeanwhile, in child care programs around the country, America’s children are already in the midst of their most critical days of brain development, their brains rapidly producing new neurons. Regardless of which circuits of the brain are strengthened and which are not, lawmakers will continue to debate how much of our money and attention the early years are deserving of, and then pass children along to schools where many teachers will attempt to solve the very problems that didn’t need to be created in the first place.\n\nSara Hutchinson contributed research to this story.\n\nThis story also appeared in The Nation.\n\nThis story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, and reviewed and distributed by Stacker.","summary":"States have been more assertive than ever before in developing their own child care policies.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/03/09/american-child-care-future/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-627403956.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 13:10:30","author":"Stacker","authors":["Stacker"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.6},{"id":298362134,"title":"The age of the comeback: Trump, Cuomo are latest in politicians who have ‘rebounded’ from career-enders","text":"“Our country is on the verge of a comeback, the likes of which the world has never witnessed, and perhaps will never witness again.” \n\nThat is how President Donald Trump described the American dream and the current landscape for the country. But he could have been referring to himself.\n\nAmerica’s momentum, spirit and pride has returned, the president told a joint session of Congress last week before touting his own re-election victory. \n\nIn the eight years since he was first elected and then re-elected, Trump was impeached twice, determined to be the “central cause” of the January 6 Capitol attack, convicted of 34 crimes in New York and held civilly liable for sexual abuse. Not to mention that he also faced criminal charges at state and federal levels, was accused repeatedly of past sexual misconduct and promoted baseless claims about Covid-19 treatments as thousands of Americans died on his watch. \n\nStill, the plurality of Americans voted him in for a historic non-consecutive second term. \n\n“Never been anything like it,” Trump said in his address. Historians have marked his comeback and he seems to be immune to most controversies that have brought down previous political figures or ended their careers. \n\nNow, other scandal-plagued politicians, such as Andrew Cuomo and Anthony Weiner, are trying to accomplish similar comebacks. Both men stepped down from their posts after being entrenched in scandal. It appeared, at the time, their careers were over. But, now they are trying to be like Trump and return to politics. Cuomo is running to be the next New York City mayor while Weiner is running for city council. \n\n“If Donald Trump can do it, why not us?” Larry Stuelpnagel, a clinical associate professor of journalism and political science at Northwestern University, told The Independent about the thinking. \n\nCuomo, then the governor of New York, resigned in 2021 after a barrage of sexual harassment allegations and claims that he undercounted deaths from Covid-19 in nursing homes. In the years since he stepped down, prosecutors have dropped criminal cases stemming from sexual misconduct accusations and ultimately never brought charges regarding his handling of the Covid-19 deaths. \n\n“But I would say both Cuomo and Weiner have a steeper hill to climb in their comebacks, particularly Weiner,” Stuelpnagel added.\n\nWeiner stepped down from Congress in 2011 after a sexting scandal came to light. He then pleaded guilty in 2017 to sending sexually explicit images to a 15-year-old girl, landing him in prison for 21 months. To make matters worse for Weiner, investigators searching through his laptop in 2016 found emails from his wife Huma Abedin, top aide to then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, prompting the FBI to reopen an inquiry into Clinton’s private email server days before the 2016 election. \n\nMany have since considered Weiner a factor in Clinton’s defeat to Trump.\n\nOne potential advantage for both of these candidates is name recognition. The upcoming races are potentially a test to see if the old adage is true: all press is good press. That hasn’t necessarily been true if scandal was involved. \n\nHistorically, “if there was a scandal, people would try and stay away from that person,” but now that “seems to be much less of an issue” as people become desensitized to scandal-plagued candidates, said Tabitha Bonilla, an associate professor of Human Development and Social Policy at Northwestern.\n\nRichard Nixon, for example, couldn’t have successfully won an election after Watergate, she said. “Now that we have this big example of a convicted felon running for president and winning, there just seems to be much more permissibility about people having comebacks.” \n\nThe New York mayor’s race takes that thinking to the extreme. As it currently stands, the two biggest names in the municipal race — Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams — carry quite a bit of baggage. Federal prosecutors charged Adams with bribery and other counts in September. \n\nLast month, the Trump administration sought to dismiss the corruption charges after an alleged “quid pro quo.”\n\n“This is an incredibly unique race in and of itself, just given that the top two names on the list both have ties to negative things,” Bonilla said. She suspects the lesser-known candidates will emphasize they don’t have checkered pasts.\n\nTrump, the political comeback pioneer, has aided some Republicans with comebacks of their own.\n\nAs South Dakota governor, Kristi Noem released a memoir in which she admitted to fatally shooting her puppy. In the face of heavy public scrutiny, she refused to back down, even doubling down on her decision to kill her “worthless” wire-haired pointer. Her political career appeared to remain more or less unscathed. Although taken out of the running as a potential pick for vice president, just seven months after these revelations surfaced, he chose her to serve as his secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nTrump has also provided a political lifeline for failed 2024 presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The vaccine skeptic managed to survive being publicly outcast by his own famous family, admitting to driving around with a bear carcass and dumping it in Central Park and confessing to settling two “misconduct” cases during his Senate confirmation hearing to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nMatt Gaetz, however, didn’t have the same fate. The former Florida Republican Representative resigned from his post in Congress after Trump picked him to serve as his attorney general, leading the department that once investigated sex trafficking allegations against him. A Justice Department brought no charges against him, but he couldn’t escape the mountain of concerns and resurfaced allegations. Gaetz ultimately dropped his bid for AG, saying his run was “becoming a distraction.” \n\nPerhaps Gaetz’s case marks the limits of a potential comeback.\n\nIt raises questions as to whether other scandal-entrenched politicians -such as Al Franken, the former Minnesota Democrat who resigned amid sex misconduct claims, or George Santos, the serial fabulist who was expelled after federal prosecutors accused him with wire fraud - could make a comeback. \n\nWeiner and Cuomo are both Democrats and are unlikely to get a helping hand from Trump in their races, but they do all share something in common. \n\nTrump, Cuomo, and Weiner have all faced sexual misconduct allegations. Only Weiner was convicted criminally, Cuomo apologized for “making anyone feel uncomfortable” but denied touching anyone inappropriately. At the time of the 2024 election, 28 women had publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\n“I think sex scandals have long been an area where the public has downplayed the [potential] culpability” of alleged perpetrators, Bonilla said, pointing to Bill Clinton, who was impeached but not removed from office after his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.\n\n“There is a tendency for people either to minimize what's happened or to kind of pay much more attention” to the person-in-question’s other, more positive contributions, she added. \n\nThis phenomenon appears to already be playing out. Democratic New York Rep. Richie Torres has already backed Cuomo, telling the New York Post last week that he wasn’t interested in “relitigating” Cuomo’s resignation amid the sexual misconduct allegations. \n\n“I predict the comeback story of the 2025 election will be the resurrection of Andrew Cuomo,” he told the outlet.\n\nIt’s difficult to piece together the confluence of factors that could have led to Trump’s comeback: Joe Biden’s delayed exit from the 2024 race. Kamala Harris’ standing as the first Black woman and first Asian American nominee for president on a major party ticket. The massive socio-cultural shifts that sprung up in response to Trump’s term — like Black Lives Matter protests or the #MeToo movement. Trump’s popularity among the GOP. Rapid inflation. \n\nMaybe Trump’s resurgence largely hinged on messaging.\n\nThe Trump campaign co-opted the negative press and turned it into strategy. His mugshots were slapped onto Trump-branded merchandise and sold to support his campaign. He accused federal prosecutors of “weaponizing” the Justice Department against him and repeatedly branded the probes into him as “witch hunts.”\n\nFor Stuelpnagel, a particular quote often attributed to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels came to mind: “A lie told once remains a lie. A lie repeated 1,000 times becomes a fact.” Trump has essentially told so many falsehoods — amplified on the world stage — so many times that, at least to some, they’re now considered a fact, he said. \n\n“Trump has been able to repeat, repeat, repeat. He's had some very willing allies in the form of, most prominently, Fox News… and right-wing influencers who don't do fact checking,” Stuelpnagel said. \n\nTo put things in perspective, after the president’s 99-minute speech to Congress Tuesday, the New York Times fact-checked his remarks, marking more than a dozen claims as baseless, misleading or exaggerated.\n\nCuomo and Weiner don’t enjoy that kind of round-the-clock news coverage.\n\nTo add to the information problem, young voters have gravitated toward getting their news from non-traditional outlets such as social media and podcasts. \n\n“The mainstream press has really lost its touch with a lot of young voters. Stuelpnagel said. “He ran a smart campaign by avoiding the mainstream media and going to the so-called influencers who never really fact-checked him, never really challenged him.”\n\nDifferent strategies and circumstances define the New York races for Cuomo and Weiner. The primary elections are held in June, when voters will decide if the two can unstick themselves from their past scandals or if “Teflon Don” stands as the lone exception. He did, after all, write The Art of the Comeback. \n\nReferring to the first of what would be six bankruptcies, he wrote in the 1997 book: “There were some dark moments. But I never had any doubt that I'd come back.”","summary":"Donald Trump’s 2024 re-election victory may have ushered in an era of political resurgence, as former New York Gov.

Weston was 15 when a fentanyl-laced pill poisoned him in 2022. My son wasn’t an addict; he was a vibrant, active teenager with a big heart. He attended church twice a week, played football and hockey, surfed in the Pacific, and had a laugh that could light up a room. I tried to be the best mom I could be, cheering him on at his games, cooking family dinners, volunteering at school, but none of that was enough to save him from the poison tearing our country apart. Weston’s death wasn’t an overdose; it was a poisoning. Like so many teens, he wanted to fit in and made one mistake of taking a pill from a friend, thinking it was safe. One pill. One mistake. That’s all it took to rob us of his future and steal my son from our family. I REPRESENT A BORDER DISTRICT THAT WAS SWAMPED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. WHAT I'M SEEING NOW MIGHT SURPRISE YOU Because of the previous administration’s bad border policies, our kids can no longer learn from their mistakes; now they die from them. I hold Joe Biden and every Democrat who champions open borders accountable for my son’s death. Every single one! When Biden took office in 2021, we were living in Southern California, and he flung the doors to our country wide open. Our borders became a highway for chaos as cartels, traffickers and fentanyl poured in. I never imagined it would one day take my son from me. That was never going to happen in my house; that’s something you only saw on the news. But the policies of Biden and his \"border czar,\" Kamala Harris, turned a blind eye to the poison flooding our streets. They allowed this to happen, and families like mine paid for their reckless policy. MEXICO BROKE INTERNATIONAL LAW WITH THE CARTELS AND AMERICANS SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES Illicit fentanyl is now the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45 and is responsible for nearly 70% of the 110,000 \"overdose\" deaths we see each year in this country. One pill… just one pill, can end a life. Weston’s death is proof of that. It’s not about addiction; it’s about a supply so deadly and addictive, it’s inescapable. And where does it come from? Mexico, with its cartels running unchecked; Canada, where fentanyl labs are popping up under lax oversight; and China, which is shipping the chemicals that fuel this nightmare. For too long, these countries did nothing while our children died. That’s why I’m so grateful to President Donald Trump. He’s taking the fentanyl crisis seriously, something I wish we’d seen when Weston was still alive. President Trump is implementing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China to hold them accountable for allowing this poison to flow freely into our country. He’s not just talking about the problem; President Trump is hitting these nations where it hurts: right in their wallets. The president doesn’t think they’ve done enough, and neither do I. Mexico’s government coddles cartels. Canada is allowing labs to proliferate. China is flooding the market with precursors. Enough is enough! FOUR TOUGH QUESTIONS FOR FOUR 'SANCTUARY CITY' MAYORS These tariffs are an emboldened wake-up call to force accountability. They say to our neighbors and trading partners: stop the drugs, or pay the price. Some critics complain about the costs of these tariffs, but I ask, what is the cost of a child’s life? What value do you put on my child and on the hundreds of thousands of people who have lost their lives on American soil under the last administration? I’d pay anything to have Weston back, and President Trump understands that. He’s a father and a fighter, using America’s economic muscle to protect families like mine. This isn’t about politics; it’s about survival. I think about my Weston every day. He should be 18 now, planning his future, his college path, what he wants to major in, not reduced to a name on a headstone. Biden’s open borders let this poison in, but Trump’s tariffs are a step toward shutting it out. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION It’s too late for my son, but it’s not too late for yours. The fentanyl crisis has taken too many, with hundreds of thousands of American lives stolen by an illicit drug, a poison that seems unstoppable.

It also illustrates how Colorado has benefited from strong federal oversight even when it has one of the more robust environmental justice laws in the country.\n\nYet the agreement between the EPA and CDPHE is not a done deal. Colorado’s air quality regulators still must write a proposed policy, present it to a state commission for approval and then follow it once it’s in place.\n\nThere will be no penalty if Colorado fails to follow through, especially with the sharp transition to a new administration that is now dismantling the EPA’s environmental justice branch — making it even more vital for the state to commit to protecting people who live in neighborhoods that bear the brunt of air and water pollution, advocates said.\n\n“I am concerned. Without EPA’s oversight we’re going to have to be very diligent in pushing CDPHE to do the right thing,” said Ean Tafoya, vice president of state programs for GreenLatinos.\n\nEnvironmental advocates say the returning president made it clear on Day 1 that he has little interest in supporting the EPA’s mission to protect air, water and land, especially in communities such as Commerce City, where the residents suffer a disproportionate burden of pollution from industries that all Americans rely on for gasoline, cement and other industrial products.\n\nTrump rescinded two of Biden’s executive orders that had prioritized environmental justice shortly after he was sworn into office. The dismantling continued from there.\n\nThe president’s decision to freeze EPA funding via grants created by Congress and the Biden administration is undergoing a legal challenge, but, if successful, would strike programs to address methane pollution from oil and gas wells, train workers for the clean energy sector, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, and clean up asbestos and other contaminants from public property.\n\nTrump’s new EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, has pledged to slash the agency’s budget as major workforce reductions are hitting agencies across the federal government. Ten people who specialize in environmental justice in the EPA’s Denver office already have been put on administrative leave.\n\nZeldin issued a memo Feb. 4 titled “Powering the Great American Comeback” that outlines five pillars that will guide the agency’s work. While the first pillar is to provide “clean air, land and water for every American,” the other four address industry and economic needs — restoring energy dominance, permitting reform, making America the artificial intelligence capital of the world, and reviving American auto jobs.\n\nWhen asked about the agency’s commitment to environmental justice under Zeldin, EPA spokesman Richard Mylott said in an email, “EPA will follow the law and our statutory duties to protect human health and the environment.”\n\nBut Colorado environmentalists are skeptical that the Trump administration will protect the environment, especially since the president has scoffed at the science of climate change.\n\n“By and large, we had an EPA we could turn to,” said Joe Salazar, an Adams County attorney and former Democratic state legislator who has worked on environmental issues. “With a Trump administration, No. 1, we might not even have an EPA or, No. 2, we have a blunted EPA or, No. 3, we have an EPA that reverses course and defends polluters in weird ways. We don’t really know what’s going to happen, but we know it’s not going to be good.”\n\nRoots of environmental justice\n\nEnvironmental justice first became a federal priority during the Clinton administration when the president in 1994 directed the EPA to shift resources to marginalized communities that bore the brunt of pollution.\n\nThat directive grew from an increasing understanding in the 1980s and ’90s that people in poor communities that had been built around refineries, factories and landfills were sicker with asthma and other illnesses than people in other neighborhoods, said Chris Winter, an environmental lawyer and executive director of the University of Colorado Boulder’s Getches-Wilkinson Center for Natural Resources, Energy and the Environment.\n\nPeople who live in those more polluted neighborhoods often are Black, Latino or Indigenous; earn less money; live in homes with lower values; and sometimes do not speak English as their first language. Those circumstances make it difficult to move away, forcing children to be raised around polluters such as the Suncor refinery.\n\nOther areas of the state that have been designated as disproportionally impacted communities include Pueblo, the Western Slope and the San Luis Valley.\n\n“Folks who are marginalized in low-income communities have less mobility,” Winter said. “They’re trapped.”\n\nTrump undid Clinton’s order when he took office in 2017, Winter said.\n\nBiden and Vice President Kamala Harris restored that priority on environmental justice during their administration, creating advisory councils, directing money toward communities overburdened by pollution and creating stronger regulations that cover air quality, asbestos use, coal ash cleanup and PFAS, also known as forever chemicals, which contaminate water.\n\n“Environmental justice is saying let’s focus government efforts around pollution to where it’s needed most,” Becker said. “Where is the pollution the worst? Where is the investment the least? At the end of the day, that’s all environmental justice is asking.”\n\nBut Trump and Zeldin are again rolling back policies that benefit those who are most at risk from pollution, Winter said.\n\nThe plans to downsize the EPA will strip the agency of scientists and drain it of institutional knowledge on complex environmental laws and how those laws protect land, water, air and people, he said.\n\nAmericans also can expect the Trump administration to reframe the story about environmental justice and disproportional impacts, Winter said.\n\n“They’re going to try to downplay the importance or severity of those concerns,” he said. “Changing the narrative will be a part of their playbook.”\n\nThe administration also will roll back the EPA’s practice of conducting environmental justice analyses on air- and water-pollution permits, which establish the amount of toxic chemicals that companies can release, leaving those communities to continue drinking more contaminated water and breathing dirtier air than their neighbors.\n\nAnd it will cut funding for projects such as increased air-quality monitoring in polluted neighborhoods, Winter said.\n\n“That was a big part of the Biden administration,” he said. “Those types of funding opportunities are really important to disproportionately impacted communities to have a say in their communities.”\n\nMajor vs. minor modifications of permits\n\nAll of those moves are what gave Becker a sense of urgency to get CDPHE to sign that agreement that would put more scrutiny on air permits for big polluters.\n\n“The recognition of the Civil Rights Act intersection with environmental laws was a priority of the Biden administration and we knew it would not be a priority for the Trump administration,” Becker said.\n\nTo that end, the EPA’s inspector general under Biden — who has since been fired by Trump — realized the agency had never conducted a review of its compliance with civil rights laws and ordered it to be done.\n\nThe EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights studied COVID-19 death rates in cities with poor air quality and found Commerce City and north Denver were among the worst in the nation, Becker said. So the agency picked Colorado as a focus.\n\nSuncor was already on Becker and the EPA’s radar because CDPHE had been slow to renew the Commerce City refinery’s two Title V air permits and because public complaints about repeated permit violations were rampant. Becker thought the EPA could push the state to change the way it reviews those permits, which ultimately must receive EPA approval.\n\nIn March 2022, the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice informed CDPHE that it was launching a review of the state agency’s Air Pollution Control Division to investigate whether it followed federal civil rights laws in administering the Clean Air Act.\n\n“We looked at Colorado and determined that part of the way Colorado manages Title V permits is that communities are excluded from the process,” Becker said. “We never reached a conclusion that said, ‘You’re violating the Civil Rights Act.’ But we said the process you’ve set up has limited opportunity for public comment. And because the majority of these pollution sources are in low-income, diverse communities, there could be a Civil Rights Act violation.”\n\nBecker’s team at the EPA met with people in the community to hear their complaints and to collect ideas for a resolution. Ultimately CDPHE agreed to change how it addresses minor changes to Title V air permits.\n\nWhen a company receives a Title V permit, it’s valid for five years. During that period, a company must seek CDPHE and EPA approval if it wants to change the amount of pollution it releases into the air. But if a company wants to make minor changes that would create more pollution, but below a certain threshold, it does not have to go through the more robust approval process, which includes a public comment period.\n\nThe issue has been that polluters avoid more intense scrutiny by claiming they are going to make small changes in the amount of pollution coming from their facility by separating out projects rather than aggregating them into one larger plan, said Jeremy Nichols, a senior advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity. Those polluters tell the state the changes will be minor, and the state approves the request with no public review.\n\n“What happened is people discovered that small changes that polluters claimed were minor were actually pretty significant,” he said.\n\nThree groups representing the oil and gas industry declined to comment for this story. But in the past, representatives from the industry, chambers of commerce and other trade associations have argued that, while they are committed to protecting the environment, too many government regulations threaten their economic stability and the future of their businesses.\n\nIn January, the American Petroleum Institute sent a seven-page memo to the EPA with its priorities for the new Trump administration. The institute’s list included actions on auto emissions, ozone standards, methane emissions and clean water rules. The memo reminded the new administration that the federal government’s regulations “directly shape the industry’s ability to innovate, maintain economic stability and meet evolving energy demands — all while prioritizing environmental protection and public health.”\n\nOver the years, environmentalists like Nichols have accused Suncor of dividing its major alterations into smaller projects to avoid the more intense scrutiny. Environmentalists raised questions about it last year in petitions that asked the EPA to object to both of Suncor’s permit renewals.\n\nEfforts to reach Suncor officials for comment were unsuccessful.\n\nEarthJustice, on behalf of the Center for Biological Diversity and the Sierra Club, noted in its petitions that Colorado regulators have allowed Suncor to begin making changes at its Commerce City refinery as soon as it files a minor-modification notice. No modeling was used to determine whether emissions changes would increase the amounts of sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides the refinery released and without any public determination as to whether the changes would trigger a violation of federal air quality standards.\n\nThe EPA asked the state’s Air Pollution Control Division to revisit those sections of Suncor’s air-pollution permits.\n\n“Colorado ultimately did that analysis when they did the Suncor permit and decided there wasn’t an issue and EPA was satisfied with that,” Becker said.\n\nBut Becker and the community wanted to make that process for minor modifications more transparent so the public would know what Suncor is doing.\n\n“We thought CDPHE would be open to this,” Becker said. “It seemed like it wasn’t something CDPHE was going to initiate on their own and we didn’t think the Trump administration would do it.”\n\nThe Colorado health department voluntarily agreed to propose a new rule that would change how it reviews those minor modifications to air-pollution permits by creating a process for public notifications and public comment. It would give people who live near the refinery — with the help of groups like the Center for Biological Diversity — a chance to review projects and provide input as to whether they would result in major or minor increases in toxic emissions.\n\n“EPA stepped up and Colorado made concessions”\n\nThe state has one year to bring a proposed rule to the Air Quality Control Commission, which creates air pollution regulations that state health officials must carry out. That commission, whose members are appointed by Gov. Jared Polis, is not legally bound by the agreement with the EPA and could reject any proposals submitted. There would be no penalty for Colorado failing to uphold its end of the deal.\n\nWhile CDPHE signed the agreement with the EPA, the agency continues to maintain that it has a strong environmental justice program and is a national role model for its work.\n\nColorado is one of 12 states that have environmental justice embedded in state law, and CDPHE manages an environmental justice office that helps carry it out. Since the law was passed in 2021, polluters are required to include environmental justice analyses in their permit applications and do more to notify the impacted communities of their plans.\n\n“CDPHE viewed this partnership with EPA as an opportunity to further examine its civil rights and environmental justice work, and explore potential areas for improvement above and beyond current practice,” department spokeswoman Kate Malloy wrote in an email.\n\nThe Air Pollution Control Division plans to file a rule proposal by January, Malloy wrote.\n\n“The agreement itself does not change our process, as it currently, and previously, complies with federal requirements,” Malloy wrote. “We committed to raise the topic of minor modifications with the Air Quality Control Commission. The commission will determine whether to adopt any changes.”\n\nWhile the agreement could fall through, further weakening protections for Colorado’s most environmentally vulnerable communities, it illustrates the important role the EPA serves in the state, especially when it comes to environmental justice, said Nichols, of the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\n“EPA stepped up and Colorado made concessions,” he said. “It speaks volumes as to how the state doesn’t get it right all the time. They need scrutiny.”\n\nLucy Molina, an environmental activist who lives in the shadow of the Suncor refinery, started questioning environmental policies several years ago when she realized her family and her neighbors were frequently sick. They suffered from nose bleeds, asthma attacks and cancer. No one seemed to care about their suffering until they started speaking out.\n\nWhile there is uncertainty over the EPA’s future, she plans to continue participating in marches and rallies and speaking during public meetings.\n\n“This is a matter of life and death. We’ve been fighting for our lives,” Molina said. “This administration — they’re murdering us. We are going to continue to fight for our lives. We’re going to continue to speak our voices and share our stories.”\n\nGet more Colorado news by signing up for our Mile High Roundup email newsletter.","summary":"The agreement between the EPA and Colorado illustrates how the state has benefited from strong federal oversight even when it has one of the more robust environmental justice laws in the country.","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/03/09/colorado-environmental-justice-epa-trump-biden/","image":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TDP-L-Environmental-Justice-RJS-0001_69dc0c.jpg?w=1024&h=726","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 12:00:27","author":"Noelle Phillips","authors":["Noelle Phillips"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":298368496,"title":"Is wealth inequality leading to a class war?","text":"A Vox reader asks: What is wealth inequality and class warfare and why is it extra bad at this point in time?\n“Wealth” is someone’s net worth — that is, their assets (like savings, stock portfolios, and the value of their property) minus their debts (like student loans). “Wealth inequality” is measured by looking at how total wealth is spread out across the population. The more wealth there is at the top, the more inequality there is because there’s less to go around for everyone else.\nToday, there’s a huge gap in incomes between rich and poor. Even though incomes across the board rose at relatively similar rates in the decades after World War Two, incomes at the very top started to grow much faster after the 1970s — a trend that’s driven, at least in part, by shrinking union membership. For instance, CEOs’ compensation has grown by 1,085 percent since 1978 while the average worker’s salary has only grown by 24 percent. \nAnd though wages at the bottom have grown at a faster clip than those at the top in recent years, that change has not been enough to reverse the overall trend. Since 1979, the top 1 percent of earners saw their wages grow by 182 percent; the bottom 90 percent saw their wages grow by 44 percent. As a result, the concentration of money at the top of the income ladder is at the highest it’s been in nearly 100 years. \nBut that’s income inequality, which just looks at the distribution of people’s wages. What’s more extreme is the gap in wealth between rich and poor households. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the bottom half of households have an average net worth of $51,000. Collectively, they own just 2.5 percent of household wealth in the country. By contrast, the top 10 percent of households had an average net worth of nearly $7 million and own more than two-thirds of household wealth — a share that has only been growing over the last three decades. \nThere are other worrying aspects of the wealth gap, including racial inequality. On average, for every $1 that white families owned, Black families and Latino families owned 23 cents and 19 cents, respectively.\nClass warfare, or class conflict, happens when the tension between social classes comes to a boil. That happens when the interests of different classes diverge, building resentment between them. Oftentimes, this comes in the form of protest or revolt and is generally viewed as a struggle between workers and the ruling class or elites in society. Sometimes this gets violent, as was the case in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, when workers in multiple states went on strike after railroad workers saw their wages get repeatedly cut. Eventually the rebellion was squashed by the National Guard and private militias, and about 100 people were killed.\nWhy does this matter?\nPart of the reason you might be hearing phrases like “wealth inequality” or “class warfare” more often these days is because the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the few has been on full display. In January, for example, Donald Trump, a billionaire, was sworn in as president while being surrounded by other billionaires. (There were many, many millionaires in the audience as well.) So as most Americans who watched Trump’s inaugural address saw it on their screens, a handful of the world’s richest men had a front-row seat. In fact, the combined wealth of everyone at the Capitol that day topped $1.2 trillion.\nAt its very core, the reason this level of inequality is bad is because it’s deeply unfair. But it’s not just a matter of fairness. It’s also dangerous. The fact that so few people own so much wealth is a threat to democracy.\nIn his farewell address, former President Joe Biden warned the nation that the United States was becoming an oligarchy — a system of government in which power is only shared by a small group of elites. It’s a warning that politicians like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have been talking about for years, especially after the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United allowed corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections.\nThe hoarding of wealth is already having an impact on our government. Since Trump returned to the White House, he’s handed over a lot of power to Elon Musk, who, with a net worth of hundreds of billions of dollars, stands to be the world’s richest man. And while Musk is charged with gutting the federal workforce, he’s not required to adhere to certain government standards. \nWhy is it that Musk has been able to evade the ethics rules that typically apply to other government personnel? And why is it, anyway, that Musk — now an unelected bureaucrat — has so much influence over policymaking? The answer is that Musk likely gained access to so much power because he spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the election last year in an attempt to help Republicans win, and his investment seems to have paid off. He operates by different rules than everyone else because he can simply buy his way to the White House.\nThe concentration of wealth has also degraded some of the country’s institutions outside of government. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for example, who owns the Washington Post, directed the newspaper’s opinion pages to avoid publishing views that are in conflict with his own, focusing their coverage on “personal liberties and free markets.” Bezos also killed the Post’s endorsement of Kamala Harris last fall.\nIt’s not necessarily the case, though, that America is on the brink of a class war, despite the fact that there’s so much inequality that billionaires are taking joyrides to space while millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet. In fact, the last election cycle showed that people in different income brackets are becoming less politically divided, with Trump making gains among poorer voters, who historically have overwhelmingly voted for Democrats. \nBut if history is any guide, this level of inequality is unsustainable, and the economy might course-correct. Between 1800 and 1920, for example, inequality in the US grew very quickly. But in the 60 years that followed, the gap between rich and poor shrank significantly. During that period, the wealth of the average family grew 40 times its size while the wealthiest Americans saw their fortunes double.\nIt’s hard to say how the situation will improve this time. But chances are, at some point, that the rich will push their luck and the rest will say enough.","summary":"A Vox reader asks: What is wealth inequality and class warfare and why is it extra bad at this point in time?

What voters want is not","text":"Michael Duncan was adjusting the screen on his front door when he paused recently to consider what he wants from California's next governor. Duncan admittedly hadn't given the matter much thought. But when you get down to it, he said, the answer is fairly straightforward: Do the basics. Fight crime. Fix the state's washboard roads. Address the perennial homelessness problem. And do a better job, to the extent a governor can, preventing wildfires like the inferno that decimated wide swaths of Southern California. \"I just roll my eyes,\" said Duncan, who logs about 120 miles round trip from his home in Fairfield to his environmental analyst job in Livermore — and who knows exactly where to swerve to avoid the worst potholes along the way. \"Why does it take so long to do simple things?\" The answer is complicated, but that won't necessarily mollify a California electorate that seems anxious, aggrieved and out of sorts — especially as regards the state's current chief executive. More than a half-dozen candidates are bidding to succeed Gavin Newsom. Some have pursued the job for well over a year now, eyeing the day, in January 2027, when term limits force the Democrat from office. You wouldn't know that, however, talking to a wide assortment of Californians — many of whom hadn't the slightest clue who's running. In conversations last week with nearly three dozen voters, from the outskirts of the San Francisco Bay Area through Sacramento to the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, not a handful could name a single one of the declared candidates. \"That guy in Riverside, the sheriff,\" said Zach House, 31, referring to Republican Chad Bianco. Outside his door, an 8-by-12-foot American flag snapped loudly in the wind whipping through his Dixon neighborhood, down streets named Songbird, Honeybee and Blossom. \"Right now,\" House said, \"that's the only person I know that interests me.\" \"The Mexican American gentleman,\" Brenda Turley volunteered outside the post office in Rosemont, meaning Antonio Villaraigosa. \"Wasn't he the mayor of Los Angeles?\" (He was.) Admittedly, it's relatively early in the gubernatorial contest. And it's not as though events — the fiery apocalypse in Southern California, Hurricane Trump — haven't been fairly all-consuming. But if voters seem to be paying little attention to the race, most echoed Duncan's call for a focus on fundamentals, expressing a strong desire the next governor be wholly invested in the job and not view it as a mere placeholder or steppingstone to higher office. \"I feel like [Newsom] spent more time trying to campaign to be president for the next go-round than working on the state itself,\" said Duncan, 37, who described himself as a moderate who tends to vote against whichever party holds the White House, to check their power. That all-in commitment is something Kamala Harris may wish to consider as she weighs a campaign for governor — and something she'll no doubt have to address, in the event she does run. The former vice president, now dividing her time between an apartment in New York City and her home in Brentwood, remains every bit as polarizing as she was during her truncated White House campaign. Turley, a retired state worker, said she'll get behind Harris without question if she runs. \"Go for it,\" the 80-something Democrat urged. \"Why not? She has the experience. Look at her political background. She was [California] attorney general. She worked in the Senate.\" Peter Kay, 75, a fellow Democrat, agreed. \"She's better qualified than about 90% of the people that run for any office in this country,\" said Kay, who lives in Suisun City. (The retired insurance underwriter, just returned from the car wash, was buffing a few water spots off his black Tesla and had this to say about the company's CEO: \"If he wasn't Elon Musk, he would be in some institution, probably sharing a wing with Trump.\") The conservative sentiment toward Harris was summed up by Lori Smith, 66, a dental hygienist in Gold River, who responded to the mention of her name with a combination wail and snort. \"Oh, God! Oh, my God!\" Smith exclaimed, vowing to leave California if Harris is elected governor. \"I could never see her being president. We dodged a bullet there. I think she just needs to live her little life in some little town somewhere and go away.\" There is, of course, no pleasing everyone, even with the sky a brilliant blue and the hills a shimmering green, thanks to a blessedly wet Northern California winter. Some griped about overly stringent environmental regulations. Other said more needs to be done to protect fish and wildlife. Some said more water needs to go to farmers. Others said, no, city dwellers deserve a bigger share. Some complained about homeless people commandeering shared public spaces. Amanda Castillo, who lives in her car, called for greater compassion and understanding. The 26-year-old works full time at a retail job in Vacaville and still can't afford a place of her own, so she beds down in a silver GMC Yukon with her boyfriend and his mother, who were inside the public library charging their electronic devices. \"I consider myself to be lucky,\" Castillo said, \"because if I wasn't sleeping in the car I'd either be on the street or in a cardboard box.\" Hanging over every conversation — like the big, puffy clouds above, but much less enchanting — was President Trump. Most partisans differed, as one would expect, on how California should deal with the president and his battering-ram administration. \"Anybody who has a platform should be speaking out,\" fighting Trump in the courts and resisting any way possible, said Eunice Kim, 42, a Sacramento physician and professed liberal, who paused outside the library in El Dorado Hills as her boys, 5 and 8, roughhoused on the front lawn. Tanya Pavlus, a 35-year-old stay-at-home mom, disagreed. The Rancho Cordova Republican voted for Trump and cited a litany of ills plaguing the state, among them high gas prices and the steep cost of living. Anyone serving as California governor \"could use all the advice [they] can get from the president,\" Pavlus said, \"because the situation speaks for itself.\" But not everyone retreated to the expected corners. Ray Charan, 39, a Sacramento Democrat who works for the state in information technology, said, like it or not, Trump is president, \"so you have to come to some sort of professional arrangement. You may not agree with all the policies and everything, all the headlines and the personality stuff, but if you can somehow come together and work for the betterment of the state, then I'm all for it.\" Sean Coley, a Trump voter, was similarly matter-of-fact. \"There's no fighting Trump. We've seen that,\" said the 36-year-old Rancho Cordova Republican, a background investigator and part-time wedding photographer. \"If you want federal funding, if you want progress, you have to work with those who are on a different side of the table, especially when they're as aggressive as Trump is. \"I would get a Venn diagram. Figure out what he's for, what you're for,\" Coley suggested. \"Figure out what's in the middle, and tackle that hard.\" Pragmatism of that sort may not summon great political passions. But practicality seems to be what many Californians are looking for in their next governor.","summary":"Conversations with an assortment of residents show most have no clue who's running in 2026.

Who Will Triumph?","text":"On Thursday, California Governor Gavin Newsom released the first episode of his new podcast, This Is Gavin Newsom, where he was joined by an unexpected guest.Charlie Kirk, a committed supporter of President Donald Trump and the head of the conservative advocacy group Turning Point USA, spoke with Newsom about a range of subjects, including identity politics, youth engagement in politics and the growing power of podcasts as a media form.The Democratic Party has been reeling from its presidential defeat in the November, which saw Trump triumph over then-Vice President Kamala Harris—securing 312 electoral votes to the Democrat's 226. Further compounding Democratic woes, the Republicans also took control of the Senate and held the House, meaning they have a majority in both chambers of Congress.Newsome, who has been widely tipped as a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, used the interview to discuss a number of his party's major concerns.When Kirk asked, \"Is there a place for a pro-life Democrat in the Democratic Party?\" The governor replied: \"There should be. On principle, there should be.\"Newsom also described the participation of transgender athletes in women's sports as \"deeply unfair.\" He said an ad in which the Republican candidate argued that \"Harris is for they/them; Trump is for you\" was a \"brutal\" and \"brilliant campaign commercial.\"Newsom's remarks triggered an immediate backlash from within the progressive movement, with former Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot calling them \"disgusting.\"She added, \"There are kids waking up today in California with this news thinking that their governor hates them, and rightly so.\"Kelley Robinson, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, said: \"Our message to Gov. Newsom and all leaders across the country is simple: The path to 2028 isn't paved with the betrayal of vulnerable communities—it's built on the courage to stand up for what's right and do the hard work to actually help the American people.\"California Representative Sara Jacobs, the vice chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, told Politico, \"What's unfair is the targeting of transgender kids and politicians abandoning them for political expediency.\"Newsweek contacted the Democratic Party for comment outside regular office hours via the online inquiry form on its website.Speaking to Newsweek,Thomas Gift, a political scientist who heads the Center on U.S. Politics at King's College London, said Newsom's remarks likely show the direction of travel within the Democratic Party.\"Newsom's comments show that he's serious about 2028,\" he said. \"In short, he gets it. He understands that running to the left on social issues isn't a political winner. The only question is how quickly other Democrats follow his lead.\"\"Democrats who insist on running as left-wing culture warriors won't be running very long. That's just simply not where the median American voter is at the moment,\" Gift added.Mark Shanahan, an American politics expert who teaches at the University of Surrey in the U.K., took a similar view.He told Newsweek: \"The U.S. has taken a turn to the right, and the next presidential election will reflect that. Whoever challenges for the Democrat nomination will have half an eye on the national battle, where the economy, security and national pride are likely to outweigh liberal issues. The Californian governor is simply setting his stall out early.\"The debate within the Democratic Party over Newsom's latest comments reflects a more general division on why the party lost the 2024 presidential election, with more centrist elements attributing this to unpopular stances taken by progressives on culture war issues.A New York Times/Ipsos poll published in January found that 79 percent of Americans did not believe people assigned male at birth who identified as female should be able to take part in women's or girls' sports, including 67 percent of those who identified as or leaned Democratic.Speaking at the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics on February 18, Pete Buttigieg, the former transportation secretary and another possible 2028 Democratic presidential contender, argued that certain progressive positions were turning people into Trump supporters.He said: \"What do we mean when we talk about diversity? Is it caring for people's different experiences and making sure no one's mistreated because of them, which I will always fight for. Or is it making people sit through a training that looks like something out of Portlandia, which I have also experienced, and it is how Trump Republicans are made.\"In February, Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank, hosted an event focused on the party's 2024 electoral defeat. It attributed the loss to what it said was an overfocus on identity politics, too much commitment to an unpopular government bureaucracy and economic factors.The organization urged Democrats to focus on \"patriotism, community, and traditional American imagery\" and celebrate \"moderation, individualism, and masculinity\" going forward. It said the party should abandon \"far-left candidate questionnaires\" and move \"away from the dominance of small-dollar donors whose preferences may not align with the broader electorate.\"","summary":"Democrats are bitterly divided on the reasons for their 2024 presidential election defeat and how to avoid a repeat.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democratic-civil-war-has-started-who-will-triumph-2041639","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2602904/democratic-civil-war-has-started.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 08:00:02","author":"James Bickerton","authors":["James Bickerton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.128},{"id":298261324,"title":"IWD: Nigerian women tell success stories amidst challenges","text":"Nigeria joined other countries of the world yesterday, March 8th, to celebrate women who have achieved in their various fields of endeavour amidst challenges including gender inequality, systematic barriers, among others.\n\nIt was in commemoration of the 2025 International Women’s Day (IWD).\n\nThis year’s theme ‘Accelerate Action’’ stressed the significance of taking instant and pivotal ladders to achieve gender equality.\n\nIt calls for increased drive and urgency in addressing the systemic barriers and biases that women face, both in personal and professional spheres.\n\nSpeaking with BusinessDaySunday, President, Commonwealth Business Women, Africa, Ngozi Oyewole described the theme as both timely and impactful and added that it emphasised the urgent need to not only recognise the progress made toward gender equality, but also to actively push for faster and more effective actions that drive tangible change.\n\nOn women involvement in business, Oyewole, who is also the brain behind NOXIE, a furniture manufacturing company, observed that the involvement of women in business has seen remarkable growth and transformation in recent times.\n\nAccording to her, more women are stepping into entrepreneurial roles, breaking barriers, and making significant contributions to various sectors, including technology, finance, and manufacturing.\n\nWhile stating that the rise of women-owned businesses is not just a trend, she added that it reflects a broader cultural shift towards recognising the value and potential of women’s leadership and innovation.\n\nTo her, initiatives aimed at empowering women entrepreneurs, such as access to funding, mentorship programmes, and networking opportunities have played a crucial role in this positive change.\n\nRecounting the challenges of women entrepreneurs, she said: “While progress is evident, challenges still exist; women entrepreneurs often face hurdles such as limited access to capital, societal expectations, and balancing work and family responsibilities. It is essential for us to continue advocating for policies that support women in business and to create an ecosystem where women can thrive.’’\n\nShe further said: “We are committed to championing the cause of women in business, providing platforms for collaboration, and fostering a community where women can share their experiences and insights.\n\n‘’The future is bright for women entrepreneurs, and together we can drive sustainable economic growth and development across our regions.’’\n\nOn her part, Chairperson, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Creative and Entertainment group, Ngozi Omambala affirmed that women in the entertainment industry have made significant strides over the years, showcasing a positive trend towards increased representation compared to a decade-and-a-half ago.\n\nWhile progress is evident, Omambala, who is also the managing director of NMO Management, observed that there remained a noticeable gender disparity in specialised and technical roles across various sectors such as film production, directing, and music production.\n\n‘’In the music industry, female representation has achieved historic levels of success, with notable artists like Tems and Ayra Star earning prestigious accolades like Grammy and MOBO awards, garnering global recognition for their artistry.’’\n\nShe however, stressed the need to enhance the indigenous industry infrastructure to uphold standards of excellence without solely relying on external validation.\n\nTo her, highlighting Nigerian and continental talents on global platforms not only boosts economic growth but also contributes to GDP through creative sector forex receipts. \n\nThis exposure, she added, promotes cultural heritage, fosters economic development, and diversifies the economic landscape promoting non-oil sectors.\n\nShe emphasised the need for the industry to embrace technology, particularly through music streaming, enhance revenue generation by broadening sales and accessibility avenues.\n\nOn how to address the challenges facing women entrepreneurs, Oyewole said, they can be addressed through educational advocacy and reforms that integrate creative arts into school curriculum from an early age, fostering a more progressive mindset and infrastructure development.\n\n“Strong Leadership roles in government administration and academia will play a pivotal role in nurturing creative talent and promoting inclusivity,’’ Omambala added.\n\nGiven a brief summary of an average Nigerian woman, she said: “She embodies strength and versatility, characterised by resilience, empathy, and an entrepreneurial spirit. She is adept at balancing multiple responsibilities, prioritising family values, and fostering a positive mindset that contributes to overall well-being and healthcare focus within the family unit.’’\n\nVice President, South–East Zone Nigerian Society of Engineers, Felicia Agubata said that the annual event as an opportunity for women to evaluate their journey, share their success stories and learn from their shortcomings.\n\nEvaluating how women have fared in the engineering sector, Agubata affirmed that women in the sector are doing great across all critical measures both qualitatively and quantitatively.\n\n“Though we are not yet where we want to be, at the same time, we are no longer where we used to be. In essence, we have made commendable progress.\n\n“For a start, for the first time in the history of the profession, a woman, Magaret Aina Oguntala is the president of the Nigerian Society of Engineers, the foremost engineering institution in Africa. This is a testament to the progress made by women in the profession,’’ Agubata said.\n\nMonalisa Okojie, who leads Nehita Group of Companies, observed that women have made progress in governance but added that\n\ntrue representation is still far off.\n\n“While leaders like Kamala Harris and Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala are breaking barriers, many countries still have male-dominated political spaces. In some parliaments, women hold less than 30 percent of seats, and even when they do get elected, they often struggle to have real influence.\n\n‘’Rwanda is a great example of progress, with women making up over 60 percent of parliament due to gender quotas,” she said.\n\nShe regretted that policies affecting women’s lives are still made without their voices in many parts of the world, adding that true representation means not just having women in office but ensuring they have power to shape decisions.\n\nEnumerating some factors limiting women’s political participation, Okojie, who is also a legal practitioner, said they include cultural norms, financial challenges, lack of mentorship and networks, harassment and intimidation, among others.\n\nOn the way forward, she called for financial support and leadership training, saying that women need access to funding and mentorship to build strong political careers.","summary":"Nigeria joined other countries of the world yesterday, March 8th, to celebrate women who have achieved in their various fields\n\n\nread more IWD: Nigerian women tell success stories amidst challenges","url":"https://businessday.ng/life/article/iwd-nigerian-women-tell-success-stories-amidst-challenges/","image":"https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Nigerian-women-success-stories.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 07:58:57","author":"Ngozi Okpalakunne","authors":["Ngozi Okpalakunne"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.387},{"id":298242664,"title":"Kamala Harris' niece launches vicious attack on Elon Musk's family","text":"Kamala Harris' niece has mocked Elon Musk after a woman awkwardly claimed online she gave birth to his 13th child.\n\nAshley St Clair claimed the Tesla billionaire was the father, then sued him for paternity and accused him of ghosting her after only seeing their baby three times.\n\nMusk has not publicly acknowledged the child, though he was photographed cradling a baby St Clair said was him, and last month had yet another baby with a different woman. \n\nMeena Harris, a lawyer, author, and theater producer whose mother Maya Harris is Kamala's sister, stuck the boot into Musk over the drama. \n\nAn Instagram video jointly posted with journalist Liz Plank showed the pair and beauty vlogger Deepica Mutyala and a fourth woman raising their arms in similar fashion to a Mexican wave.\n\n'Raise your hand if you’ve never wanted to have a baby with Elon Musk,' was written over the top of the video.\n\nThe video was captioned: 'What Elon got done last week: ran away from his baby mamas.'\n\nMeena posted an Instagram story referencing her Musk trolling, implying it was an example of a strategy to oppose Musk and Donald Trump.\n\nShe shared a screenshot of a tweet arguing: 'Democrats need to take a page from the Kendrick Lamar school of winning'.\n\n'1.

Musk replied. To which, she responded 'He is perfect.' Musk replied: 'I look forward to seeing you and him this weekend.' \n\nIn another, St. Clair sent him a selfie of her and a friend, to which Musk replied: 'Hi cutie.' She then texted him back, saying: 'Hi, see u soon.' \n\nMusk followed up with: 'I want to knock you up again'.\n\nGrimes also went to extraordinary lengths to contact Musk about co-parenting issues, posting on Twitter pleading for him to get in touch about one of their offspring. \n\n'Plz respond about our child's medical crisis. I am sorry to do this publicly but it is no longer acceptable to ignore this situation. This requires immediate attention,' the Canadian singer wrote. \n\nShe wrote that Musk didn't even have to respond to her but could contact her through a third party. \n\n'If you don't want to talk to me can you please designate or hire someone who can so that we can move forward on solving this.

Now the perps have been caught, and in a scenario we have seen play out entirely too often in recent years, both were found to have rap sheets a mile long. And, despite a long string of arrests on serious charges, both were on the streets, and both were still in the United States.

Andrew Cuomo.\n\nBut many of her supporters see her candidacy as something else: an opportunity for Democrats to elect a qualified Black woman to lead the country's largest city, less than a year after the bruising loss of Kamala Harris, the first Black woman to lead a major party presidential ticket.\n\nWearing a pink pantsuit, Adams entered to cheers at the Rochdale Village Shopping Center in southeast Queens and danced with supporters as \"I'm Coming Out\" by Diana Ross played.\n\n\"No drama, no scandal, no nonsense, just competence and integrity,\" Adams said at the rally, summing up her candidacy.\n\nAdams, the City Council speaker and a Queens native, faces a tough path to the mayor's office amid a crowded primary field and her own considerable fundraising lag. But to the city's most steadfast Democratic voting bloc, Black women, Adams' candidacy represents more than a litany of messaging and policy promises.\n\nIf elected, Adams would be the first woman to become mayor of New York City. So far, one other woman in the June 24 primary is vying for the job -- Jessica Ramos, a Queens-based state senator who, if elected, would also be the city's first Latino mayor.\n\nAdams enters the race with roughly $200,000 in her campaign account, well behind the other candidates, who have been fundraising for several months. She will need to quickly raise enough money to meet the threshold for matching funds. She will also need to rush to garner signatures before the city's April 3 deadline for securing a place on the ballot.\n\nBut her allies say she may have a powerful lifeline in the city's influential network of politically engaged Black women. Several prominent Black female Democrats, including Letitia James, the state attorney general, are supporting her campaign.\n\nJames, who made calls to influential labor and civic leaders and elected officials to gauge interest in Adams' candidacy, said she was inspired to do so after hearing her speak at Albany Caucus Weekend.\n\nThe crowd broke out into a chant of \"Run, Adrienne, run!\"\n\n\"I could feel it,\" James said. \"Especially in the aftermath of the loss of Kamala Harris.\"\n\nShortly after President Donald Trump's inauguration, a group of Black women in New York City who had worked to elect Harris and were mourning her defeat began channeling their energy into assembling a wish list of Black women who could run for mayor.\n\nThey wanted James to run. They noted, however, that she had begun collaborating with attorneys general from across the country to file lawsuits against the Trump administration's policies, including the mass firing of federal employees and the freezing of billions in congressionally approved payments to states, and did not want to take her away from that work.\n\nAnother person the women considered was Jennifer Jones Austin, CEO of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. In an interview, Jones Austin celebrated Adams' entrance into the race, but added a word of caution about the pragmatism of Black voters.\n\nMost of the city's Black female voters will consider candidates' policies and electability over their demographics in deciding whom to vote for, she said. Still, pointing to the unsuccessful campaigns of Harris and Maya Wiley, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights who ran in 2021 to be the city's first Black female mayor, there remains an active base for Adams to court, Jones Austin said.\n\n\"I don't think that because in both instances the women did not ultimately prevail means that Black women are disconnected, disenchanted or now apathetic in any way,\" said Jones Austin, who is remaining neutral in the primary.\n\nThree other Black women have run for mayor of New York City before Adams, including Wiley; C. Virginia Fields, a former Manhattan borough president; and Dianne Morales, a nonprofit executive who identifies as Afro-Latina.\n\nYet, in many ways, Adams finds herself in a situation similar to that of Harris. She was drafted into the race as an alternative to Eric Adams and Cuomo, both of whom, like Trump, have a history of ethical issues and allegations of sexual misconduct, which both men have denied.\n\nThat point was driven home by Althea Stevens, a City Council member from the Bronx who referred to Harris' defeat in her speech at Adams' campaign launch.\n\n\"The last time a Black woman ran a couple of months ago, we didn't listen, and now we are dealing with the consequences,\" Stevens said.\n\nA recent Quinnipiac poll found Cuomo leading with 31% of support from Democratic voters and Eric Adams far behind in second with 11%. Adrienne Adams, who is not related to the mayor, trailed with 4%, but the poll was taken last week before she entered the race, and she was still polling above some candidates who had been running for months. Ramos also had 4%.\n\nAdams has a record of standing up to the mayor on the budget and even leading the council to override two of his vetoes on public safety bills, the first time that had been done in two decades. She has notably dropped her last name from her campaign literature, making it just \"Adrienne, Democrat for NYC Mayor.\"\n\n\"I plan to build a winning coalition by appealing to New Yorkers who want a city government that has restored trust and effectiveness for every single community,\" Adams said in an interview.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nBlack women have often been hailed as the \"backbone\" of the Democratic Party, a nod to their long track record of supporting Democratic candidates en masse. More than nine in 10 Black female voters cast a ballot for Harris in November, and Black women make up a larger portion of the city's Black Democratic base.\n\nAdams, as a representative of that group and a product of Spelman College, a historically Black women's college in Atlanta, could have an inside track to galvanizing their support.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nShe has focused her tenure as speaker on issues such as maternal health, restoring budget cuts to libraries, community mental health and college access, and has cultivated a natural base of support, said Yvette Buckner, a Democratic strategist and co-chair of the New Majority NYC, a group dedicated to electing women to the City Council.\n\n\"She understood the assignment,\" Buckner said.\n\nBut Cuomo also understands the importance of Black female voters. Since he announced his candidacy last weekend, he has rolled out a steady stream of endorsements from Black female elected officials. Hours before Adams' campaign kickoff, Cuomo announced that another Black council member from Brooklyn had endorsed him.\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nFor Black women in New York who are still feeling the sting of Harris' loss, Adams' entry into the mayoral race could be reinvigorating. Trump has interjected himself into the city's affairs, seeking to cancel congestion pricing and calling for the dismissal of the federal corruption charges against Eric Adams.\n\n\"We do think that this is a time where our leadership is needed,\" said Waikinya Clanton, founder of Black Women for Kamala Harris. \"Especially at the local level.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"NEW YORK -- As Adrienne Adams officially kicked off her mayoral campaign on Saturday, she urged potential voters at a rally in Jamaica, Queens, to view her as an alternative to the city's two most recognizable candidates, Mayor Eric Adams…","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/for-black-women-adrienne-adams-is-more-than-just-another-candidate/article_f430c004-a607-591e-8251-7edbd5df5041.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 01:58:52","author":"Diana Ross,Maya King and Jeffery C.

Now, amid calls for the police officer jailed for 22 years for killing George Floyd to be PARDONED, I still believe there are troubling questions over his trial...","text":"It was a moment that convulsed America and reverberated across the world. On the fateful evening of May 25, 2020, in a street in the city of Minneapolis, lay an unarmed black man, gasping for his life. ‘I can’t breathe,’ he said repeatedly as a white police officer seemed to press down on his neck with his knee. Then the man stopped speaking and his body became motionless.\n\nThe life of 46-year-old George Floyd was over. But the explosive fallout from his death was about to begin. The day after Floyd died in police custody, Minneapolis saw huge protests, which by nightfall had descended into violence, complete with vandalism and attacks on the police.\n\nWorse rioting followed over the next four days, forcing the police to abandon one of their precinct buildings in unprecedented scenes of disorder. Soon, with millions watching the footage of Floyd’s death on their phones and in some cases frustrated after months of Covid lockdown, violent unrest was sweeping through America’s cities, accompanied by angry demands for racial justice led by the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThe fury of demonstrators was all the more intense because George Floyd’s final, harrowing moments captured on video served as a metaphor for the darkest fears about police racism and brutality. Just as the image of Floyd’s face became a symbol of the fight for equality, so his agonising last words, ‘I can’t breathe’, were turned into a battle cry against oppression.\n\nThe police remained the prime target for the rioters’ discontent, reflected in calls to slash their budgets or even ‘defund’ them entirely. And the immediate focus was on ensuring that the men seen as directly responsible for Floyd’s death were held to account for their actions, particularly Derek Chauvin, the officer who had played the central role in restraining Floyd with his knee. He and three colleagues – Tou Thao, Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane – were put in the dock in early 2021.\n\nThe trial was presided over by Judge Peter Cahill, who rejected all requests to delay it because of the incendiary prevailing atmosphere, which had the potential to undermine the fairness of proceedings. To cheers from Black Lives Matter activists and other radical groups, Chauvin was found guilty of second-degree murder and was sentenced to 22 years in prison. The other three were jailed on lesser charges of aiding manslaughter.\n\nAround the world, the relief at the outcome was widespread. Soon after the jury had reached its verdict, President Joe Biden declared that the case ‘had ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see systemic racism’. In an even more extravagant vein, Nancy Pelosi, the Democrat Speaker of the House, thanked Floyd ‘for sacrificing your life for justice’.\n\nYet the killing of George Floyd also generated a climate of hysteria over race. Suddenly, ‘white privilege’, ‘unconscious bias’, ‘decolonisation’, ‘critical race theory’ and ‘cultural humility’ were phrases we all began to hear.\n\nAs a black woman journalist and commentator, I experienced this myself. At one point, when I dared question some aspects of the BLM movement, I was maligned as the worst kind of racist and even – absurdly – called a ‘black Nazi’.\n\nDerek Chauvin, whose very name is synonymous with racist evil, is like the hate figure Emmanuel Goldstein in George Orwell’s novel 1984, designated by the state as an enemy of the people. But given the backdrop of turmoil in America in early 2021, it is now legitimate to ask whether he really received a fair trial. The willingness even to pose such a question would provoke outrage among liberals and would be seen by some as an act of racism in itself.\n\nBut that kind of overblown hostility to any scrutiny is in fact precisely why we should revisit this episode. Justice will not be protected by censorship and insults.\n\nEver since 2021, there have been voices expressing doubts about the verdict. One is that of Liz Collin, the former CBS reporter whose film, The Fall Of Minneapolis, disputes much of the conventional wisdom about the case. Commentators like Tucker Carlson have been just as sceptical, warning of the danger that ‘facts’ can be twisted to fit an agenda.\n\nLast week, conservative influencer Ben Shapiro launched a petition calling on President Trump to pardon Chauvin on the grounds that Floyd was not ‘murdered’ at all but died from the impact of a drug overdose on a pre-existing heart condition. Shapiro published a letter addressed to the President on his site The Daily Wire claiming that Chauvin was ‘unjustly convicted,’ writing: ‘Make no mistake – the Derek Chauvin conviction represents the defining achievement of the woke movement in American politics.’ Such a call would have been unthinkable only four years ago. But as the election of Trump proves, there is a growing backlash against the woke world view.\n\nSo is the conviction of Chauvin really open to challenge? To find a possible answer, we have to go back to that tragic evening in 2020. The events that led to Floyd’s death began when a store clerk contacted the police to report that Floyd had just made a purchase with a counterfeit $20 bill.\n\nImmediately, Chauvin, an experienced officer with almost 20 years in the city force, was dispatched to the scene with his three colleagues, Kueng, Thao and Lane. Ironically in light of the subsequent race furore, the quartet was very diverse, with Thao of Asian heritage and Kueng hailing from a mixed-race background. Chauvin, too, had never been accused of racism. If he had been, the prosecution would have ruthlessly exploited such a fact at his trial.\n\nWhen the officers turned up to question Floyd, they found him behind the wheel of his parked car, with two other people in the back – an alleged drug dealer called Morries Hall and a woman named Shawanda Hill, who was also said to be a supplier. The police quickly saw that Floyd was in an agitated state, rocking back and forth, crying and apparently concealing drugs in his mouth. In an attempt to play the victim, he at once told officials two lies. ‘I just lost my mum,’ he said, though she had actually died two years earlier.\n\nSecondly, he claimed that last time he was questioned by police ‘I got shot’. This again was untrue. In 2019 he was stopped in his car by another officer on suspicion of using drugs but no shot was fired.\n\nIn fact, the incident was remarkably similar to the one in May 2020, as Floyd, having eaten the drugs in his mouth, grew agitated and had to be restrained before he was taken to hospital.\n\nIn May 2020, Floyd begged the officers not to shoot him. They had no intention of doing so. They just wanted to question him and carry out a search for further fake bills or drugs. But they soon ran into trouble, as Floyd would not leave his car. ‘Stop resisting,’ Shawanda Hill wisely said from the back. But he did the opposite, and a ruck began. At one stage the officers managed to push him into the back seat of their vehicle, from where he complained of claustrophobia and anxiety, while he also said he ‘could not breathe’. Tellingly, this was before he was on the ground with Chauvin’s knee against him.\n\nWith his lengthy criminal record, Floyd always made a slightly incongruous international hero. His convictions included theft, drug possession and dealing, criminal trespass and aggravated robbery, for which he received a four-year jail term. So the allegation that day of using a counterfeit bill was just the latest in a catalogue of offences.\n\nStill agitated and struggling, Floyd ended up on the ground beside the police car.\n\nPrecisely what happened next is critical. One of the most vexing questions at Chauvin’s trial was whether the method he adopted against Floyd – leaning on him with his knee on the suspect’s neck – was officially sanctioned or not. Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo testified under oath that his department did not train officers to use the technique.\n\nHowever, the department’s own training manual appeared to instruct officers in just such a method, known as the ‘Maximal Restraint Technique’. In Liz Collin’s film, several officers express their indignation at their chief’s perceived dishonesty about MRT.\n\nThere were also claims at the trial that the police were indifferent to Floyd’s wellbeing. After Chauvin’s conviction, Tim Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota and later Kamala Harris’s vice-presidential running mate, remarked that in the Floyd video ‘the lack of humanity is sickening’.\n\nI have my own doubts about this. It was Chauvin’s team, after all, who called for emergency medical support. The ambulance arrived late, but that was not the fault of the police.\n\nOf greater consequence was the autopsy report, which highlighted compelling evidence that Floyd might not have been killed by the police at all. And here, in a disturbing twist, the progressive political establishment stands accused of interfering with the proper judicial process to ensure that Chauvin ended up behind bars – and that the narrative of ‘police oppression’ was maintained.\n\nSuffering from hypertension and other cardiovascular problems, as well as a tumour in his pelvis, Floyd was not a well man, according to Hennepin County examiner Andrew Baker. The autopsy was conducted by Baker, who wrote in his initial report that he found no signs of asphyxiation or strangulation, and no bruising on Floyd’s neck or back, though Baker had discovered significant quantities of the opioids fentanyl and methamphetamines in his system. These could have exacerbated Floyd’s existing heart condition.\n\nWith the mob on the rampage against the police, the initial autopsy report was not what the authorities or Floyd’s liberal supporters wanted to hear at all. In fact, complaints soon flooded in to Baker’s office. After a meeting with six FBI officers and other state officials, Baker agreed that his report should emphasise that pressure to the neck had been a major factor. This was backed up by a second autopsy report, commissioned by the Floyd family, which came to the conclusions that were seemingly wanted.\n\nThere were other aspects of the trial that ensured the ‘right’ results were achieved. The jury was not sequestered until its final deliberations, so its members were always aware of the anger of the protesters. Indeed it is hard to see how they could have remained impartial, especially when politicians like congresswoman Maxine Waters threatened more unrest if a guilty verdict were not returned. ‘We’ve got to stay on the streets and get confrontational,’ she told the press during the trial.\n\nThere is a sense in liberal circles that this case is untouchable – because to doubt the guilt of Chauvin would be to destroy the underpinnings of the BLM movement and the global ‘diversity, equity and inclusion’ industry. So many jobs, government grants and consultancies are tied to the belief that Chauvin was a racist murderer that there is tremendous pressure to stick to the story.\n\nGiven the number of questions and inconsistencies surrounding the case, a judicial review and potential retrial seem to be the least that Derek Chauvin deserves. If he is truly guilty, let justice be served after a cold-hearted look at the facts.\n\nBut nearly four years on, we must ask: was justice truly served, or was Chauvin simply a scapegoat for a nation’s collective guilt?","summary":"Derek Chauvin's name has become synonymous with racist evil.

Opinions editor David Shipley immediately resigned after Bezos said he only wanted the paper to publish op-eds that promoted ‘personal liberties’ and ‘a free market’. Last year, the paper reportedly lost 300,000 subscriptions when Bezos withdrew the paper’s en--d-orsement of Kamala Harris as president.\n\nThis is a far cry from 2016, when the paper adopted the rather cringe-worthy motto ‘Democracy Dies in Darkness’ and took an aggressive stance against Donald Trump. The paper’s opinion pages, which function separately from the news pages, took an adversarial position against Trump and profited from that. Most media commentators in the US say the paper produced stellar journalism “that illuminated the depths of Trump’s self-dealing”, wrote Slate. To be fair, Bezos profited from the paper’s then strategy.\n\nA lot of things are unclear now, from what democracy will look like in the US under a second Trump era to the fate of left-leaning writers at the Washington Post whose owner seems to be pulling the plug on its motto.\n\nHowever, what is clear is that Bezos feels differently now. Opinions that oppose “[libertarian] pillars will be left to be published by others”, he wrote. How does it serve audiences if they’re only reading opinions that adhere to Bezos’ beliefs? The billionaire believes that in the age of the internet, there’s no need for newspapers to have “broad-based opinion sections that [seek] to cover all views”.\n\nFew are buying it. And that is because Bezos is a businessman whose interest is to make more money, even if it means moving away from the core purpose of journalism, which is to inform the public. When he bought the paper in 2013, “the Post went from hemorrhaging advertising revenue to becoming a profitable business in 2016”, wrote CNN in 2019, “and continuing to be profitable not just in 2017, but also in 2018”.\n\n Money really will buy you influence.\n\nHowever, the paper had lost 50 per cent of its audience in 2020 — ostensibly because democracy was not dying in darkness under Joe Biden — and then in 2023, losses of $77 million. It began culling jobs, which, of course, impacted the journalism the paper had come to be associated with. Bezos also made bad management decisions last year in the hope that the paper’s financial misfortunes would turn around. They did not. Early this year, New York Times reported the Post was considering changing its motto to ‘Riveting Storytelling for All of America’.\n\nThe ‘all’ is probably a nod to Trump and his supporters, who have not received favourable coverage. I don’t know if changing the motto will convince MAGA supporters that the Post is now their paper of record. It’s hard to imagine that Bezos went from championing independent journalism at his paper to suddenly writing memos on what constitutes opinion in his pages because he loves Trump. I think he knows what will happen if he doesn’t do so. Trump has been clear about how he plans to restructure the government and even the private industry. Bezos has a lot of business interests and cannot afford to lose government contracts.\n\nOne look at how Bezos has been cosying up to President Trump and you get the full picture. Trump hailed Bezos’ decision not to endorse a presidential candidate last year.\n\nAmazon, which is owned by Bezos, gave $1m to Trump’s inaugural fund in Dece-mber last year. He, along with Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Tesla’s Elon Musk and Open AI’s Sam Altman were also reported to have don--a-ted to that fund. It explains their prominence at his inauguration in January. A few days before his an--no-uncement about the op--inion pages policy, he had dinner with Trump.\n\nMoney really will buy you influence. That’s stating the obvious. And should be a reality check for those who think billionaires owning news media is a good idea. In Pakistan, businessmen invest in channels and use it to win favours — all at the cost of journalism.\n\nNone of us here believe that media owners don’t bear any influence on their papers. If you’re lucky, some exert less influence than others and you have a newspaper product that holds the powerful to account.\n\nThe award-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes quit the Post after a critical cartoon showing powerful businessmen, including Bezos, bowing to Trump was rejected at the paper. She was right when she said: “Of course these are businesses, and I understand that. But they own a newspaper and they have an obligation, frankly, to protect the free press.”\n\nWe live in a time where fake news is rewarded, it is monetised, it is preferred. A free press is essential all over the world, especially when trust in media is on the rapid decline. The answers lie in robust public media which serves the people first. \n\nThe writer is a journalism instructor.\n\nX: @LedeingLady\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 9th, 2025","summary":"THE Washington Post reportedly lost 75,000 digital subscribers last week after owner Jeff Bezos’ note announcing changes to his newspaper’s opinion pages.

Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.)’s recent admission that trans women competing in women’s sports competitions is “deeply unfair.” \n\nNewsom made the claim during the first episode of his new podcast featuring guest TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk.\n\nThe governor recognized how much impact the issue had during the election, telling the conservative activist, “Boy, did I [see] how you guys were able to weaponize that issue at another level.”\n\nAfter making the issue a central part of his 2024 campaign, President Trump signed the “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports” executive order in February that prohibits schools and colleges that receive federal funds and are subject to Title IX from allowing men onto women’s sports teams and into women’s locker rooms and restrooms.\n\nStill, Carville dismissed the issue, stating that the trans issue isn’t that important, at least in his view. \n\n“If you’re concerned about the state track meet, please do something about it. We have an athletic association, they can do it. But if you’re more concerned with that or more concerned about bathroom stalls, then hang out in bathrooms. I just – this is not of a concern to me,” he said, noting that he’s more “worried about the cost of living.”\n\n“I’m worried about access to healthcare,” he also said. \n\nMorgan stopped him, saying, “I would dispute that. A lot of Democrats have tried to say to me, ‘It didn’t really matter, the trans stuff and the woke stuff,’ and I keep saying, I think it matters more than you think.”\n\nThe journalist continued, saying that “when Trump positioned himself as the voice of common sense, and you had a party led by Joe Biden and Kamala, who both thought it’s fine for biological men to compete in women’s sports, for example, that actually that was more powerful than people realized.”\n\nMorgan argued the issue appeared to be the third most important issue in the 2024 election. \n\n“Economy, one. Immigration, two. Woke mind virus, three. Supported by Kamala Harris,” he said, concluding the point. \n\nCarville replied by saying that no one has spoken out against woke, “identitarian politics,” and “faculty lounge goofy academic language” within the Democratic Party more than he has.

He even hosts his own show aboard the ship, albeit without the “you’re fired!” catchphrase.\nAddressing these perceived parallels, Bong notes that distressed audiences might be projecting their own fears onto the character. “When we showed the film in Berlin and talked to people from many different countries, it seemed like people were projecting the most stressful political leader onto the character of Marshall,” says the filmmaker.\n\nOne scene in particular is drawing the comparison — an assassination attempt where a bullet intended to kill Marshall grazes him on the cheek, just as then-candidate Trump was miraculously shot only in the ear last July. Last month, Bong said the similarity to the Butler, PA, sniper attack is purely coincidental, since he shot the film in 2022. Per Variety: “The director added that after recent events, ‘Mark Ruffalo was also quite surprised to see it play out in reality and wondered, “Were we oracles predicting the future?”‘”\n\nHowever, a review by Chris Gore, co-founder of Film Threat, and editor-in-chief Alan Ng, reveals other details in the film that they say are clear allusions to Trump and his supporters.\n\n“There’s an on the- nose line in the movie where it’s like, ‘He’s a failed politician who lost his last two elections,'” Gore explains. “This movie was assuming certain things would have happened in the real world, and they did not” — that is, Trump’s decisive electoral college win over former Vice President Kamala Harris. Gore also says the Marshall character has “rabid followers in red hats” who are the butt of a joke, and Ng mentions that Ruffalo does a dance very similar to Trump’s viral “YMCA Dance.”\n\nNg expresses disappointment that Ruffalo plays Marshall as “just a guy who’s insane and a dictator. There’s no nuance to it. There’s nothing to it other than that we’re supposed to hate the guy.”\n\nFilm Threat was not alone in its assessment. Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent, who loved the film, writes of Ruffalo’s villain: “yes, he’s obviously Trump.” Mashable‘s Kristy Puchko says the Avengers star “mimics Trump’s signature sneer and mercurial nature.” YouTuber Jeremy Jahns quips: “Felt like Mark Ruffalo was a guest on SNL, and he was the one doing the Donald Trump bit for the week, who has big fake teeth and looks like a walking Purge mask.”\n\nRuffalo himself said during a Tonight Show interview that his performance is “a documentary” snapshot of Trump in his second term.\n\n“I play a petty dictator,” he told Jimmy Fallon during the February 28 broadcast. “At the time — we shot it three years ago, and I thought, ‘This is over the top'”… And now I realize it’s totally underplayed.”\n\n“I mean, I made a documentary,” he remarked, to cackles from Fallon.\n\nMickey 17 is tracking to be a box-office bomb, with an expected global gross maxing out at $40 million its opening weekend against a pricey $118 million budget.","summary":"Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho says his new film Mickey 17 is not parodying Donald Trump with its villain played by Mark Ruffalo, but several critics say the allusions to the U.S. president are too numerous and too specific to deny.\n\n\nThe post &#8216;Mickey 17&#8217; Director Says Mark Ruffalo&#8217;s Character Isn&#8217;t a Trump Parody, but Critics Aren&#8217;t Buying It appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/03/08/mickey-17-director-says-mark-ruffalos-character-isnt-a-trump-parody-but-critics-arent-buying-it/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/03/mark-ruffalo-mickey-17-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 00:47:13","author":"Ezra Dulis,Mark Ruffalo","authors":["Ezra Dulis","Mark Ruffalo"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.061},{"id":298178228,"title":"Trump Pulled $400 Million From Columbia. Other Schools Could Be Next.","text":"The Trump administration's abrupt withdrawal of $400 million in federal funding from Columbia University, in New York City, cast a pall over at least nine other campuses worried they could be next.\n\nThe schools, a mix that includes both public universities and Ivy League institutions, have been placed on an official administration list of schools that the Department of Justice said may have failed to protect Jewish students and faculty.\n\nFaculty leaders at many of the schools have pushed back strongly against claims that their campuses are hotbeds of antisemitism, noting that although some Jewish students complained that they felt unsafe, the vast majority of protesters were peaceful and many of the protest participants were Jewish.\n\nThe Trump administration has made targeting higher education a priority. This past week, President Donald Trump threatened in a social media post to punish any school that permits \"illegal\" protests. On Jan. 30, he signed an executive order on combating antisemitism, focusing on what he called anti-Jewish racism at \"leftists\" universities. Then, on Feb. 3, he announced the creation of a multiagency task force to carry out the mandate.\n\nThe task force appeared to move into action quickly after a pro-Palestinian sit-in and protest at Barnard College, a partner school to Columbia, led to arrests Feb. 26. Two days later, the administration released its list of 10 schools under scrutiny, including Columbia, the site of large pro-Palestinian encampments last year.\n\nIt said it would be paying the schools a visit, part of a review process to consider \"whether remedial action is warranted.\" Then on Friday, it announced it would be canceling millions of dollars in grants and contracts with Columbia.\n\nHarvard University, whose former president, Claudine Gay, resigned last year after a bruising appearance before a House committee, is also on the list.\n\nSo are George Washington University; Johns Hopkins University; New York University; Northwestern University; UCLA; the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Minnesota; and the University of Southern California.\n\nThe Trump administration's moves to hobble university funding and target schools over claims that they tolerated antisemitism had already caused internal recalibration at schools across the country. Some have stepped up lobbying efforts, including hiring lobbyists with connections to Trump.\n\nMany campuses had already cracked down on students over protest activity. More are dialing back or renaming efforts related to diversity, an effort to avoid the ire of Trump officials who have vowed to end such programs\n\nAnd a number have paused hiring and reduced the number of doctoral students admitted in response to the financial uncertainty.\n\nSome school officials have said they face an \"existential threat.\" Still, many presidents have been silent or muted in their public statements about Trump's moves against the sector, appearing to retreat in fear of the new administration.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, Harvard said it was \"committed to ensuring our Jewish community is embraced, respected, and can thrive at Harvard, and to our efforts to confront antisemitism and all forms of hate.\"\n\nSeveral days after Trump's inauguration, the president, Dr. Alan Garber, posted a message to the university cowritten with other administration leaders.\n\n\"In these challenging times,\" they wrote, \"our efforts will be guided by our values and commitments: supporting academic excellence and the pursuit of knowledge; championing open inquiry, constructive dialogue, and academic freedom.\"\n\nThe selection criteria for being on the list for visits is nebulous, but a number of the schools had been included in a report in October by the House Committee on Education and the Work Force, which claimed they had allowed antisemitic behavior by students and faculty.\n\nThe report criticized Harvard leaders, citing their initial failure to condemn the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023.\n\nNorthwestern and its president, Michael Schill, also had been under attack by the House committee, then led by Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C. The committee report criticized the university for placing \"radical anti-Israel faculty\" in charge of negotiations with protesters.\n\nUC Berkeley was identified in the House report for not disciplining students who took part in an encampment or disrupted a talk by an Israeli speaker.\n\nUC Berkeley issued a statement Saturday saying, \"We are confident we have the right processes in place now to respond to any antisemitic incidents.\" The statement cited an advisory committee the chancellor formed on Jewish student life and campus antisemitism.\n\nWhile several of the schools have been focal points for campus protests, others are more of a surprise.\n\nRichard Painter, a professor of law at Minnesota, was among those who filed a complaint about antisemitism at the university. He had chafed at incidents on campus, including anti-Israeli statements posted by faculty on official department websites.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nEven so, Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, wondered if the school was targeted partly because it sits in the congressional district of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., a vocal critic of both Israel and Trump's, and in the home state of Gov. Tim Walz, who ran on the ticket with former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"Part of it is political,\" he said in an interview Saturday.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nOfficials at Minnesota could not be reached for comment, but efforts are already underway to address the complaints. The Board of Regents is expected to vote Friday on a resolution prohibiting individual departments from making political statements on issues of the day.\n\nThere was evidence suggesting that the administration's action against Columbia was accelerated by last month's sit-in at Barnard, which led to additional protests recently. The protests were sparked by Barnard's decision to expel two students who interrupted a class on Israel.\n\nOn Monday, six days after the initial Barnard disturbance, the government sent a notice to Columbia that it would review $51 million in federal contracts, citing harassment of Jewish students.\n\nThe next day, Trump released a statement on Truth Social saying, in part, \"All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests.\"\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nIn a news release Friday announcing the cancellation of $400 million in grants and contracts, the task force also accused Columbia of failing to respond to the earlier notice while antisemitic harassment continued on or near campus.\n\nOn Friday, Columbia said it was reviewing the administration's announcement and that it pledged to work with the government.\n\nAlso on Friday, Linda McMahon, the newly installed secretary of education, met with Columbia's interim president, Dr. Katrina Armstrong. McMahon issued a statement saying that schools \"must comply with all federal anti-discrimination laws\" to receive federal funding.\n\nThe task force's list was released in late February amid a flurry of executive orders from the White House.\n\nMembers of the task force include Leo Terrell, a senior Justice Department lawyer. Efforts to reach Terrell were not successful Saturday. It was also unclear if any of the campus visits had been scheduled.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"The Trump administration's abrupt withdrawal of $400 million in federal funding from Columbia University, in New York City, cast a pall over at least nine other campuses worried they could be next.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/trump-pulled-400-million-from-columbia-other-schools-could-be-next/article_a519bb4c-a2bb-574c-9717-6bbb686b00d8.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 00:25:02","author":"North Adams Pride,Stephanie Saul","authors":["North Adams Pride","Stephanie Saul"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.145},{"id":298249848,"title":"The Democrats’ fork in the road: They’ve got only 1 sane choice","text":"Yogi Berra, the mid-century New York Yankees Hall of Fame catcher known for his pithy and often humorous life observations, once famously quipped: “When you come to a fork in the road, take it.” It was sound advice, perhaps, for a traveler on the go and in search of a quick meal. But the modern Democratic Party, rudderless and confused and reeling from a pitiful collective performance during Tuesday evening’s presidential joint address to Congress, now confronts a fork in the road that’s no joke.\n\nOn the one hand lies the path of least resistance: doubling down on the status quo – the progressive culture-warring, woke/identity politics-driven agenda that has dominated the party ever since Barack Obama upset Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. On the other hand lies the more difficult but ultimately more promising path: repudiation of that post-2008 legacy and a conscientious return to a politics of the prudential center. Which path Democrats choose from here will go a long way toward determining their relevance as a national political party for the foreseeable future.\n\nObama’s shocking upset over the madam-president-in-waiting was an inflection point for the institutional trajectory of the Democratic Party. Voters rejected the cultural centrism that was a Clinton-era hallmark in favor of the “hope” and “change” promised by Obama’s “coalition of the ascendant.” Initially, perhaps, that may have looked like a smart bet: Obama trounced John McCain in the 2008 presidential general election. But the one-time “coalition of the ascendant” transmogrified into an identitarian and deeply off-putting “coalition of aggrieved interests.” Culturally militant wokeism eventually reached its pernicious apex during Joe Biden’s presidency – which saw the first explicitly “DEI” Supreme Court justice selection (Ketanji Brown Jackson, after Biden vowed to nominate a black woman) and a DEI vice presidential running mate (Kamala Harris, after Biden was pressured to choose a black woman).\n\nThis version of the Democratic Party, which featured the progenitor of wokeism, Obama himself, as the leading presidential campaign trail surrogate for Harris, was thoroughly rejected in November by the American people. It turns out that voters didn’t really know what they were signing up for when they embarked on an extended political journey of “hope” and “change.” They weren’t interested – and aren’t interested – in legitimizing the juvenile genital mutilation and chemical castration that has been euphemistically sold as “gender-affirming care.” They weren’t interested – and aren’t interested – in assenting to wide-scale importation and resettlement of foreigners whose cultures and customs are antithetical to our own.\n\nSome leading Democrats do finally seem to get the memo. Former Clinton strategist James Carville, for instance, has called for Democrats to distance themselves from the excesses of woke civilizational arson. But many others disagree. There is no indication at all, for instance, that the ladies of “The View” have done any introspection: Shortly after November’s electoral shellacking, cohost Sunny Hostin attributed Harris’ loss to Donald Trump to “racism” and “misogyny.” Surveying the left-of-center punditocracy scene, it often seems that there are far more Hostin-like voices of escalation than there are Carville-like voices of sobriety.\n\nDemocratic elected officials are also deeply split. California Gov. Gavin Newsom made headlines this week by repudiating certain facets of wokeism during an interview with Charlie Kirk, but congressional Democrats attending Trump’s joint address to Congress on Tuesday evening took the opposite approach, beyond refusing to applaud: Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, obnoxiously heckled the president and was kicked out of the House chamber within the speech’s first few minutes – deservedly so. In general, their conduct was positively buffoonish.\n\nIn what world do Democrats think they do themselves any political favors with these antics and, more important, these underlying substantive political stances? One guest of Trump on Tuesday, Payton McNabb, is a female former high school athlete who was grievously injured during a match against a team with a biological male player. On this issue, recent CNN polling indicates that roughly four-fifths of Americans oppose biological male participation in female athletic competitions. Even Newsom, in his podcast episode with Kirk, called the practice “deeply unfair.”\n\nNewsom seems to be reading the tea leaves – unlike congressional Democrats. There is a similar divide on the issue of illegal immigration and so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions; consider, for instance, New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ high-profile flip on the issue, which has brought him into line with Trump.\n\nTo make matters even worse, a majority of Democratic elites too often now come across not merely as schoolmarmish and excessively self-righteous – but as heartless and lacking compassion, to boot. Party leaders undoubtedly think of themselves as “compassionate,” especially for those perceived as being “oppressed” (on the neo-Marxist intersectional scale of victimization status). But where is the compassion for McNabb? Where is the compassion for the family of Laken Riley, the Athens, Georgia, student whose life was tragically cut short by an illegal alien who never should have been on our soil?\n\nIn order to recover their standing and regain lasting relevance as an electorally feasible national political party, Democrats are going to have to repudiate the entirety of their post-2008/post-Obama cultural legacy. That is the simple truth. The American people want a stable pocketbook, a stable border and a stable world stage. They’re not interested in the Obama-Biden-Harris Democratic Party’s idiosyncratic conception of waging a culture war.\n\nAre Democrats up to such a challenge? The intraparty civil war is on – but I certainly have my doubts. Unless and until they do repudiate their cultural militance, however, Democrats will continue to flounder about in irrelevance. Perhaps they’ll need to get their clocks cleaned at the ballot box a few more times. That wouldn’t be the worst thing.","summary":"'There are far more Hostin-like voices of escalation than there are Carville-like voices of sobriety'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/03/the-democrats-fork-in-the-road-theyve-got-only-1-sane-choice/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tim-walz-video-screenshot-2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-08 23:32:40","author":"Josh Hammer","authors":["Josh Hammer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.233},{"id":298205712,"title":"Could Tim Walz Replace Donald Trump?

The Governor of Minnesota threw his hat in the ring by mentioning that he could “consider” running for President.\n\nOne of the most highly discussed topics in American politics is who the next person to lead the country will be. As for the GOP candidates, Glenn Youngkin, Vivek Ramaswamy, Ron DeSantis, and Marco Rubio’s names have been mentioned.\n\nDonald Trump Jr’s name has also been brought up. Even though the President’s son hasn’t expressed an interest in politics, he has been fairly active during his father’s stint as President. He also played a key role in lobbying for Donald Trump’s running mate, JD Vance. Rumors about Don running as the 2028 GOP candidate have been around.\n\nAnother Trump kid who shows promise when it comes to politics is Barron Trump. The teenager’s appearance at his father’s inauguration ceremony had people convinced that he was “born to lead.” Trump supporters even started selling merch and badges that read “Barron Trump President 2044.”\n\nTim Walz is another person who made his intentions to be considered as a candidate clear. In an interview with The New Yorker Radio Hour, the Minnesota governor expressed his interest in running for president.\n\nWalz who is a Nebraska native has been the governor of Minnesota since 2019. He has also served as a ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee.\n\n“If I think I could offer something… I would certainly consider that,” he admitted during the interview. Walz was already chosen once to be the democratic nominee for Vice President. The 60-year-old served as Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\n“I would certainly consider that.”\nFailed VP candidate Tim Walz doesn’t rule out running for President in 2028, and offers a couple names on the Democrat bench he could see leading the ticket.\nvia The New Yorker Radio Hour pic.twitter.com/v7qjCh70DO\n— The First (@TheFirstonTV) March 4, 2025\n\n“I had a friend tell me, ‘Never turn down a job you haven’t been offered,’” Walz had joked in the same interview. He also quickly noted that he is “not arrogant” when it comes to knowing that there are a “lot of people that can do this.”\n\nA Reddit thread that discussed Tim Walz’s possibility of being the next Presidential candidate gained traction. “He was 100% the better candidate,” one user noted. “I’d consider voting for him, but I want to see him doing anything right now,” another added.\n\nSeveral users strongly supported the possibility of Walz being chosen as the next Democratic candidate while noting that they would vote for him. “I’d vote for him. He’s definitely down to earth and represents the average American,” one netizen commented.\n\n“Teacher, great dad, loving husband, veteran, football coach, gun owner/hunter, pro-worker, and has done amazing things for the people of Minnesota,” one user wrote while listing all of Walz’s qualifications. “Thus, there is literally no way MAGA would vote for him,” the same user added.\n\nYes, please. He’s a real progressive that workers can get behind. Would love a Walz campaign.\n— Ricky (@RickF_III) March 3, 2025\n\nOne netizen noted how Walz’s political ideologies might not make him a favorite amongst the Americans. “He led a gay-straight alliance back in the early 2000s. That’s an unforgivable crime to half the country,” one comment read.\n\nAnother netizen joined the conversation while strongly expressing their disapproval of seeing the Governor as the next President. “I’m sorry, but no. Please no.

Ron DeSantis is meeting with Trump in Palm Beach County this weekend to discuss places to build a potential Trump library, five sources tell NBC News.\n\nThough no final decision has been made, the current top targets are Florida Atlantic University, located in Palm Beach County, and Florida International University, located in Miami-Dade County. Palm Beach County is Trump’s official residence, and the location there is in close proximity to Mar-a-Lago. Miami-Dade County is home to Trump’s Doral golf resort, another one of his major properties.\n\nThere are also sites not connected to a university under consideration, sources tell NBC News. But FAU and FIU are lobbying heavily to win the site, and they have started to offer enticements, including potentially donating land to build the presidential library.\n\nTrump’s team has said it would like a new hotel associated with the presidential library, two sources tell NBC News, which is a part of the active negotiations.\n\nThe presidents of Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University are both well-connected former Republican elected officials, and both have been heavily engaged in the process. Florida Atlantic University is led by Adam Hasner, a former high-ranking member of the state House, and Florida International University’s president is Jeanette Nuñez, who was DeSantis’ lieutenant governor until he appointed her to the FIU post last month.\n\nNeither Hasner or Nuñez returned requests seeking comment. A DeSantis spokesperson also did not return a request seeking comment.\n\nThe White House did not return a request seeking comment, but a Trump administration official confirmed that South Florida has become the focus of the presidential search.\n\nEric Trump joined Witkoff and Nuñez on a tour of FIU’s potential sites over the past few weeks, a process that included Florida House Speaker Danny Perez, a Miami-Dade County Republican who has spoken directly to Witkoff and is among the leaders trying to get the library in Miami.\n\n“Eric Trump was here. He took a tour of FIU, so they have been at least looking,” said one person familiar with the tour.\n\nEric Trump has also toured FAU-aligned sites.\n\n“There has been a strong push to put the library at FAU, even offering land for construction of the library,” said a person familiar with those negotiations. “There seems to be a lot of interest in doing that because it’s in the president’s home county.”\n\n“They are evaluating all options right now, but it appears the governor and the state university system are clamoring for the chance to get the president’s library,” that person added.\n\nRepublicans in the state have been making efforts to ensure that Florida becomes the home of the presidential library. Trump was a New York resident until 2019, when he officially made Florida his primary residence.\n\nBeyond direct talks with DeSantis, the GOP-dominated Florida Legislature is moving quickly to pass a bill that would allow Republicans in Tallahassee to be in charge of decisions about presidential libraries, removing the ability of local authorities to oversee the construction of any presidential library.\n\nThe change would box out Democratic-leaning local officials in South Florida from the decision-making and approval processes around a proposed Trump presidential library. Trump carried Miami-Dade County in 2024, but Palm Beach County was one of just six Florida counties won by former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential contest.\n\n“After the flap over the size of Trump’s flag, I don’t want my president getting in trouble for being too patriotic ever again,” said Orlando-area Republican state Sen. Jason Brodeur, who is sponsoring the legislation in his chamber.\n\nIt’s a reference to a 2006 legal fight between Trump and town of Palm Beach officials over an 80-foot flagpole flying an American flag over a Trump golf course, which local officials said exceeded the maximum size allowed by town ordinances. Trump and the town later settled, allowing a 70-foot flagpole in a different location.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Alex Andrade, another sponsor of the bill, said he would be in favor of a nonuniversity site for Trump’s library to avoid a turf war between FAU and FIU.\n\n“Putting it at either university is going to result in whining and protesting,” he said. “With such an important proposition that will inevitably benefit the immediate surrounding area, it’s embarrassing that it will be met with whining and protesting.”\n\n“Either institution would be lucky to have it,” he added.\n\nAnother person familiar with the negotiations confirmed FAU and FIU are top targets, but the subject of talks this weekend between Trump and DeSantis do include other sites.\n\n“They are currently looking at sites in South Florida,” the person said. “Both FAU and FIU want it, but my understanding is they are looking at nonuniversity sites.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. — The search for President Donald Trump’s post-administration presidential library&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;Prominent Trump Advisor Joins Battle for Location of Presidential Library&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/prominent-trump-advisor-joins-battle-for-location-of-presidential-library/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Top-Trump-adviser-gets-involved-as-the.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-08 22:50:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.032},{"id":298184464,"title":"Trump Nominates Michigan Muslim Democrat Mayor as Ambassador to Kuwait","text":"President Donald Trump announced that he has nominated Amer Ghalib, the Muslim Democrat mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan, to serve as the United States Ambassador to Kuwait.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump praised Ghalib for having helped his presidential campaign to “secure a Historic Victory in Michigan.” In September 2024, Ghalib endorsed Trump in the 2024 presidential race against former Vice President Kamala Harris, noting that Trump was the “right choice” during “a critical time.”\n\n“I am pleased to announce that Amer Ghalib will be the next United States Ambassador to Kuwait,” Trump wrote in his post. “As the Mayor of the City of Hamtramck, Michigan, Amer worked hard to help us secure a Historic Victory in Michigan.”\n\nTrump continued: “Amer earned his M.D. from the Ross University School of Medicine, and continues to serve his community as a proud healthcare professional.

But the modern Democratic Party, rudderless and confused and reeling from a pitiful collective performance during Tuesday evening’s presidential joint address to Congress, now confronts a fork in the road that’s no joke.\n\nOn the one hand lies the path of least resistance: doubling down on the status quo—the progressive culture-warring, woke/identity politics-driven agenda that has dominated the party ever since Barack Obama upset Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. On the other hand lies the more difficult but ultimately more promising path: repudiation of that post-2008 legacy and a conscientious return to a politics of the prudential center. Which path Democrats choose from here will go a long way toward determining their relevance as a national political party for the foreseeable future.\n\nObama’s shocking upset over the madam-president-in-waiting was an inflection point for the institutional trajectory of the Democratic Party. Voters rejected the cultural centrism that was a Clinton-era hallmark in favor of the “hope” and “change” promised by Obama’s “coalition of the ascendant.” Initially, perhaps, that may have looked like a smart bet: Obama trounced John McCain in the 2008 presidential general election. But the one-time “coalition of the ascendant” transmogrified into an identitarian and deeply off-putting “coalition of aggrieved interests.” Culturally militant wokeism eventually reached its pernicious apex during Joe Biden’s presidency—which saw the first explicitly “DEI” Supreme Court justice selection (Ketanji Brown Jackson, after Biden vowed to nominate a black woman) and a diversity, equity, and inclusion vice presidential running mate (Kamala Harris, after Biden was pressured to choose a black woman).\n\nThis version of the Democratic Party, which featured the progenitor of wokeism, Obama himself, as the leading presidential campaign trail surrogate for Harris, was thoroughly rejected in November by the American people. It turns out that voters didn’t really know what they were signing up for when they embarked on an extended political journey of “hope” and “change.” They weren’t interested—and aren’t interested—in legitimizing the juvenile genital mutilation and chemical castration that has been euphemistically sold as “gender-affirming care.” They weren’t interested—and aren’t interested—in assenting to wide-scale importation and resettlement of foreigners whose cultures and customs are antithetical to our own.\n\nSome leading Democrats do finally seem to get the memo. Former Clinton strategist James Carville, for instance, has called for Democrats to distance themselves from the excesses of woke civilizational arson. But many others disagree. There is no indication at all, for instance, that the ladies of “The View” have done any introspection: Shortly after November’s electoral shellacking, cohost Sunny Hostin attributed Harris’ loss to Donald Trump to “racism” and “misogyny.” Surveying the left-of-center punditocracy scene, it often seems that there are far more Hostin-like voices of escalation than there are Carville-like voices of sobriety.\n\nDemocratic elected officials are also deeply split. California Gov. Gavin Newsom made headlines this week by repudiating certain facets of wokeism during an interview with Charlie Kirk, but congressional Democrats attending Trump’s joint address to Congress on Tuesday evening took the opposite approach, beyond refusing to applaud: Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, obnoxiously heckled the president and was kicked out of the House chamber within the speech’s first few minutes–deservedly so. In general, their conduct was positively buffoonish.\n\nIn what world do Democrats think they do themselves any political favors with these antics and, more important, these underlying substantive political stances? One guest of Trump on Tuesday, Payton McNabb, is a female former high school athlete who was grievously injured during a match against a team with a biological male player. On this issue, recent CNN polling indicates that roughly four-fifths of Americans oppose biological male participation in female athletic competitions. Even Newsom, in his podcast episode with Kirk, called the practice “deeply unfair.”\n\nNewsom seems to be reading the tea leaves—unlike congressional Democrats. There is a similar divide on the issue of illegal immigration and so-called sanctuary jurisdictions; consider, for instance, New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ high-profile flip on the issue, which has brought him into line with Trump.\n\nTo make matters even worse, a majority of Democratic elites too often now come across not merely as schoolmarmish and excessively self-righteous—but as heartless and lacking compassion, to boot. Party leaders undoubtedly think of themselves as “compassionate,” especially for those perceived as being “oppressed” (on the neo-Marxist intersectional scale of victimization status). But where is the compassion for McNabb? Where is the compassion for the family of Laken Riley, the Athens, Georgia, student whose life was tragically cut short by an illegal alien who never should have been on our soil?\n\nIn order to recover their standing and regain lasting relevance as an electorally feasible national political party, Democrats are going to have to repudiate the entirety of their post-2008/post-Obama cultural legacy. That is the simple truth. The American people want a stable pocketbook, a stable border and a stable world stage. They’re not interested in the Obama-Biden-Harris Democratic Party’s idiosyncratic conception of waging a culture war.\n\nAre Democrats up to such a challenge? The intraparty civil war is on—but I certainly have my doubts. Unless and until they do repudiate their cultural militance, however, Democrats will continue to flounder about in irrelevance. Perhaps they’ll need to get their clocks cleaned at the ballot box a few more times. That wouldn’t be the worst thing.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Kirk laughs, adding that the teen could come to a Turning Point event in Florida.\nThen, the governor asks Kirk for advice on how to better appeal to Americans.\n“Get better ideas,” he responds.\n“You have an opportunity to run to the middle … you right now should come out and be like, you know what, the young man who's about to win the state championship in the long jump in female sports,” Kirk continued, misgendering a high school track player in California. “That shouldn't happen.”\n“Right,” Newsom said.\n“Would you do something like that? Would you say no men in female sports?” Kirk asked. “Well, I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that,” Newsom responded. “It’s deeply unfair.”\n“So, would you speak out against this young man?” Kirk pressed, adding, “I see you wrestling with this.”\n“No, I’m not wrestling with the fairness,” the governor said. “I totally agree with you.”\nThe governor, who is widely understood to be eyeing a presidential run for 2028, described his new podcast, “This Is Gavin Newsom,” as a forum to “have honest conversations” with people who both agree and disagree with “us.”\nNewsom’s comments come as, across the country, transgender Americans continue to face increased offenses from conservative leaders in government, healthcare, and education—including directly from President Donald Trump’s administration.\nIn early February, Trump signed an executive order barring transgender student-athletes from playing on girls’ sports teams. The action, which notably doesn’t mention transgender boys and men playing in sports that align with their gender identity, claims to “protect” women.\nShortly after Trump signed the order, the National Collegiate Athletic Association changed its participation policy for transgender athletes and barred anyone who wasn’t assigned female at birth from participating in girls’ or women’s sports. (Some local leaders have pushed back on Trump’s order, including the governor of Maine, who said she would see the president “in court” over her state’s decision to allow transgender athletes to play on the teams they choose.)\nAccording to Charlie Baker, the president of the NCAA, there are fewer than 10 transgender athletes he is aware of who currently compete in college sports, and nationally, just around 1 percent of adults identify as transgender, according to the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law. This statistically small group of Americans has continued to receive an outsized level of attention from those on the right and Trump’s new administration.\nSince taking office, the Trump admin has wiped public health information for transgender Americans from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website, removed the option to select “X” as a gender on passport applications for nonbinary applicants, and ordered all State Department employees to remove pronouns from their email signatures, among other actions. The president also, on his first day in office, signed an executive order exclaiming that the US would only recognize two genders—an outdated and scientifically inaccurate move that required government agencies to enforce a gender binary on certain official documents like employment records.\nFollowing Thursday’s interview, Newsom received potent backlash from queer advocacy groups in his state and across the country for both choosing Kirk as his first guest and his comments on transgender girls and women.\n“Instead of standing strong, the Governor has added to the heartbreak and fear caused by the relentless barrage of hate from the Trump Administration,” Tony Hoang, executive director of Equality California, the state’s leading LGBT advocacy group, said. “In California, we have strong policies in place that protect transgender youth and ensure a level playing field for all students—policies that have allowed students to participate in school sports here for over ten years without incident.”\n“We woke up incredibly sickened and disappointed, because somebody who’s been a consistent ally of our community made these remarks,” Assemblymember Chris Ward, a Democrat who leads the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus, told CalMatters. “I know that he knows that until Donald Trump began obsessing about this issue, it actually hasn’t been a problem in California.”\nKelley Robinson, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBT advocacy group, said that their message to the governor “and all leaders across the country is simple: The path to 2028 isn’t paved with the betrayal of vulnerable communities.”\nThroughout the interview with Kirk, Newsom discussed how effective the right’s messaging against transgender people was in the 2024 election, pointing specifically to Trump’s advertisement where he claimed former vice president Kamala Harris was for “they/them” while he was for “you.”\nAt one point, the governor bemoaned a meeting where “people started going around the table with pronouns.”\n“I’m like, ‘What the hell, why is this the biggest issue?’” Newsom said.\nAt other times, he reminded Kirk—and the listener—of his past support for LGBT issues in the state.\nTwo decades ago, in 2003, Newsom officiated same-sex weddings before they were allowed by law. He has also long-participated in San Francisco’s Pride parade and has supported several pieces of legislation expanding rights for queer people across California. As the New York Times noted on Thursday, Newsom is also the godfather to Nats Getty, an oil heir and designer who came out as transgender in 2021. A couple of years earlier, in 2019, he delivered a toast at Getty’s wedding to Gigi Gorgeous, a YouTube personality who is also transgender.\nIn 2022, he signed a bill making California a refuge for those seeking gender-affirming care. Last year, Newsom signed another law barring school boards in conservative areas of California from requiring educators to tell parents if their kid went by a different gender identity at school. (Yet, he initially resisted the effort to support schools who chose not to inform parents and has vetoed measures that would require “judges consider a parent’s affirmation of their child’s gender identity in custody disputes and to expedite licensure for transgender health care providers,” per reporting from CalMatters.)\nThis week, Newsom told Kirk that he thinks there ought to be a “humility and a grace” when talking about transgender people. “These poor people,” he continued, “are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression.”\n“So both things I can hold in my hand. How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that I think is inherent in you but not always expressed on the issue, but at the same time deal with the unfairness?” Newsom said.\nThe governor did not comment on whether he would support two Republican lawmakers in California who have introduced bills to prevent transgender athletes from competing in girl's and women’s sports. Newsom’s spokesperson, Izzy Gardon, told CalMatters in an email that “our office does not typically comment on pending legislation.”\nAccording to researchers at The Trevor Project, the leading suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBT young people, a significant cause for suicide risk among transgender and nonbinary young people across the country is anti-transgender state-level laws.\nThey found that the dozens of anti-trans laws enacted between 2018 to 2022 led to an increase in incidents of suicide attempts among transgender and nonbinary youth by as much as 72 percent.","summary":"The governor, a likely contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028, made the comments during a podcast interview with Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/california-governor-gavin-newsom-transgender-athletes-sports-unfair","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/67cc919835e7f1f1fbf0611a/16:9/w_6000,h_3375,c_limit/1431097320","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-08 19:25:56","author":"Katie Herchenroeder","authors":["Katie Herchenroeder"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.135},{"id":298209060,"title":"Trump is eating your dreams","text":"It’s Saturday, and if you’re like me, you’re tired. Not only is there an endless stream of chaos and dysfunction coming out of the White House, most of it is illegal, illiberal, destructive and immoral.\n\nIt’s the fatigue itself, in addition to the chaos and dysfunction, that has me remembering an old clip featuring Anand Giridharadas. The writer and frequent MSNBC guest said something back in October, before the election, that he could not have known was so absolutely prescient. (Then again, maybe he did know. He’s very good at what he does.)\n\nHere’s what Giridharadas said on “Morning Joe” on October 17, 2024:\n\n“I think what’s really important now is for people across this country who may not be diehard for Kamala Harris or diehard for Donald Trump, but who love the country, who have been blessed by the many gifts of this country to say this country … has given you whatever it’s given you because of institutions – institutions that you take for granted, prospects of a peaceful transfer of power that you take for granted so you can go live your life. You can go start that restaurant. You can go do that job. You can go drive your kid to that college.\n\n“You can do all those things in a way that you cannot in Somalia because the institutions are just working in the background. You don’t even have to think about them very often. You have to vote every so often and then they work. What is at stake is you possibly not being able to do all those things you’ve done all your life, not be able to chase your dreams, not be able to make your plans, because what works in the background is not going to be working in the background.\n\n“Politics, government, persecution would become your life. This would become the full drama of our country. That’s what happens in these countries that go in that illiberal, unconstitutional direction.\n\n“And what they are proposing is not just, you know, an abstraction of fascism. It is a kind of political project where politics would eat our dreams, eat your plans, and I don’t think most Americans want that.”\n\nFive months later, it would be difficult to pick just one example of what Giridharadas was talking about, which is the collapse of democratic institutions and how their failure makes planning and dreaming and building toward a future worth living impossible for normal people.\n\nBenjamin Wittes made a partial list:\n\n“humiliating the president of an ally [Volodymyr Zelensky] under stress in the Oval Office with the cameras rolling”;“pulling back from overseas public health work [by the US Agency for International Aid] as children are dying of Ebola”;“pulling back from domestic public health work [at the Centers for Disease Control] while bird flu is decimating livestock”;“dismantling the federal government, agency by agency”;an “FBI and Justice Department being overtly politicized by clowns wielding flamethrowers, as is the military.”\n\nBut perhaps the best evidence underscoring Giridharadas’ thesis is the one that neither he nor anyone could not have foreseen, which is the handing over of constitutional authority by the Congress to an unelected and unaccountable, private and deranged individual. \n\nOr, as this CNN headline put it:\n\n“Republicans push Musk to let Congress vote on DOGE cuts.”\n\nElon Musk held a meeting with Senate Republicans this week, in which he informed them of efforts by the “Department of Government Efficiency.” According to the Post, the billionaire owner of Twitter and SpaceX told them “in a closed-door lunch that he wanted to set up a direct line for [the Republican senators] when they have questions, allowing them to get a near-instant response to their concerns.” \n\n“Some senators were given Musk’s phone number during Wednesday’s meeting, and the entrepreneur said he would ‘create a system where members of Congress can call some central group’ to get problematic cuts reversed quickly, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) said.”\n\n“This whole exchange is bonkers,” wrote Heather Cox Richardson. “The Constitution gives Congress alone the power to make appropriations and pass the laws that decide how money is spent. Josh Marshall asks: ‘How on earth are we in this position where members of Congress, the ones who write the budget, appropriate and assign the money, now have to go hat in hand to beg for changes or even information from the guy who actually seems to be running the government?’”\n\nIn a previous edition of the Editorial Board, I argued that Trump was robbing the Congress of its constitutional authority by freezing, cancelling and otherwise impeding funds that had been appropriated and signed into law. I see now that assessment was premature.\n\nAs this new reporting reveals, it was not a robbery but instead a forfeiture by the congressional Republicans. They have relinquished their power, voluntarily, to a despot who does not and will never understand the whole point of democracy, and who is burning down the institutions – the National Weather Service, the National Institutes of Health, the US Department of Education, the US Department of Veterans Affairs, to name four – that, as Giridharadas said, used to work in the background. Under Donald Trump, they no longer can.\n\nAs Giridharadas said: \n\n“Politics, government, persecution would become your life.”\n\nNearly everything that makes the United States a constitutional republic – namely, the foundational structures that were put in place in the very beginning according to which powers are separated among the three branches of the government – is now going through the hands of a “ketamine-fueled jester,” as a French politician put it, a man who may or may not listen, as he’s accountable nowhere and to no one.\n\nThe White House is aware that it’s a bad idea for a “ketamine-fueled jester” to be seen as having power that’s greater than or equal to the sum total of all the members of the United States Congress. That’s why the president held a made-for-TV Cabinet meeting yesterday, during which he reminded secretaries that they, and only they, have the legal and constitutional authority over staffing in their departments. \n\nEverything was going fine until Trump said: “We want [the Cabinet secretaries] to keep the good people. So we’re gonna be watching them. And Elon and the group are gonna be watching them. And if they can cut, it’s better. And if they don’t cut, then Elon will do the cutting.”\n\nThe chaos keeps coming. \n\nThe administration says it’s going to impose tariffs on Mexico. Then it doesn’t. It says it’s going to impose tariffs on Canada. Then it doesn’t. (Any business that does any kind of international trade cannot plan anything with uncertainty like this.) Moreover, the administration says it’s going to issue an executive order to shut down the Education Department. Then it doesn’t. It fires people who are essential to running the country. Then it tries to bring them back on the job. Hell, it fires people for doing what the administration told them to do!\n\nThe whiplash is brutal. It is everlasting. \n\nAnd it’s in addition to the fact that inflation is pushing the cost of groceries up and up. (The extortionate price of a dozen eggs is due entirely to the spread of avian flu, a disease that some officials at the US Department of Health and Human Service have said should be allowed to run its course, even though it kills about 90 percent of infected birds. We could all be nostalgic for $10 eggs before long!)\n\nThis is the criminal politics of a state on the road to failure.\n\n“What they are proposing is not just, you know, an abstraction of fascism,” Anand Giridharadas said in October. “It is a kind of political project where politics would eat our dreams, eat your plans.”\n\nIt’s no longer a proposal. \n\nIt’s reality now.","summary":"It’s Saturday, and if you’re like me, you’re tired.
