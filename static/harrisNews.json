JEFF BEZOS ANNOUNCES BIG CHANGES TO WASHINGTON POST OPINION PAGE, TOP EDITOR STEPS DOWN \"Our sincerest congratulations to beloved Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson on his retirement,\" a spokesperson for The Washington Post told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"For 45 years, his reporting and commentary spanned continents and beats, earning countless recognitions, including a Pulitzer Prize. Eugene's strong perspective and impeccable integrity have regularly shaped our public discourse, cementing his legacy as a leading voice in American journalism.\" Robinson confirmed to Fox News Digital he is only retiring from The Post, not from journalism, and has yet to make any commitments regarding his next chapter. Robinson, also an MSNBC analyst, joined The Post in 2005 and won a Pulitzer Prize in 2009 for commentary. Bezos made headlines when he announced his paper was going to be \"writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets\" and that \"viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.\" That led to the ousting of The Post's opinion editor David Shipley, who opposed Bezos' new mission.

She’s a very strong person,’ Trump said. ‘She’s been in the party a long time, she’s done a good job,’ he later added.\n\nInstead of being behind the firings, the president said that Loomer met with him Wednesday and gave him recommendations on people to hire. \n\n‘And sometimes I listen to those recommendations, like I do with everybody, I listen to everybody, and then I make a decision. But I saw her yesterday. She was at the ceremony. And she’ll always have something to say, usually very constructive,’ Trump said. ‘She recommended certain people for jobs.’ \n\nEarlier Thursday, DailyMail.com confirmed an Axios report that said Trump had fired several members of the National Security Council team. \n\nThe president didn’t offer a number to reporters during the Air Force One ride. \n\nThe dismissals come after Waltz accidentally added The Atlantic magazine’s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a Signal chat where top administration officials were discussing an attack on the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nTrump has publicly supported Waltz, a former Florida congressman, in the aftermath of ‘Signalgate’ despite some White House insiders labeling him a ‘f***ing idiot.’ \n\nHowever, The New York Times reported Thursday morning that Loomer visited the Oval Office on Wednesday and pressed for NSC firings.\n\nThe NSC is used by the president to advise him on national security, military, and foreign policy matters. \n\nLoomer came to the White House armed with research that purportedly showed some NSC staffers were not loyal enough to the president’s agenda.\n\n‘Out of respect for President Trump and the privacy of the Oval Office, I’m going to decline on divulging any details about my Oval Office meeting with President Trump,’ Loomer told DailyMail.com Thursday. \n\n‘It was an honor to meet with President Trump and present him with my research findings, I will continue working hard to support his agenda, and I will continue reiterating the importance of strong vetting, for the sake of protecting the President and our national security,’ she added. \n\nWaltz sat in on the meeting and defended members of his team, The Times said. \n\n‘NSC doesn’t comment on personnel matters,’ was the official line from NSC spokesperson Brian Hughes. \n\nBut CNN reported Thursday that the individuals fired were Brian Walsh, Thomas Boodry and David Feith.\n\nThe network said that the firings were directly the result of Trump’s meeting with Loomer, who Trump’s top Congressional ally, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, had tried to get banished from MAGA months ago. \n\nLoomer, however, has maintained a position in Trump’s orbit. \n\nThe axed officials include Walsh, a director for intelligence who previously worked for now Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Boodry, Waltz’s former legislative director in Congress who was a senior director for legislative affairs and Feth, who oversaw technology and national security. Feth had served in the State Department during Trump’s first term. \n\nLoomer had publicly set her sights on pushing out Alex Wong, Waltz’s deputy, and the one NSC staffer mentioned by name on the Houthi Signal chat. \n\nShe has mainly gone after Wong for being ‘Chinese.’\n\nWong is American, with parents who immigrated from China. \n\nLoomer also floated that Wong isn’t loyal because his wife had worked at the Department of Justice during Obama and Biden administrations and her father was a shareholder of a Chinese satellite maker. \n\n‘I don’t know why we have Chinese individuals in positions of national security,’ Loomer said of Wong in an online video posted last week. \n\nThe rhetoric surrounding Wong got so heated, that Republican Sen. Tom Cotton had to jump to his and his wife’s defense. \n\n‘Alex Wong and his wife Candice are complete and total patriots, 100% MAGA Warriors who always put America First,’ Cotton said in an X post on March 27. \n\n‘For three years, Alex worked hard for me until President Trump smartly hired him away,’ Cotton said. ‘President Trump made another great decision to hire Alex as his Deputy National Security Adviser. America is safer and better off with Alex in the White House. THANK YOU for your service, Alex!!!’\n\nIt appears that Wong wasn’t part of the ousted group of National Security Council employees. \n\nGreene, the Georgia Republican who also has a history of making controversial statements and pushing conspiracy theories, has been the most prominent MAGA member to publicly attempt to push Loomer out. \n\nIn September, ahead of the 2024 election, Greene called out a post written by Loomer as being ‘extremely racist.’ \n\nLoomer said if Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, won the election ‘the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.’ \n\nHarris is half-Jamaican and half-Indian. \n\nThe Georgia Republican called out Loomer’s ‘rhetoric and hateful tone’ and said she ‘doesn’t represent MAGA as a whole.’ \n\nGreene’s office did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com’s request for comment about this week’s Loomer development.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump denied Thursday afternoon that far-right firebrand Laura Loomer had&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Speaks Out on MAGA Star&#8217;s Role in White House Mass Firings first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-speaks-out-on-maga-stars-role-in-white-house-mass-firings/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/03/23/96883695-0-image-a-63_1743718401336.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 23:59:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.098},{"id":307443652,"title":"A look at Laura Loomer, longtime Trump ally criticized for racist posts and Sept. 11 conspiracies","text":"Trump has long praised Loomer while distancing himself at times from her most controversial comments.\n\nHere’s what to know about Loomer and what both she and Trump said about the latest incident.\n\nHow did she get close to Trump?\n\nLoomer, 31, has been involved in politics as an advocate of Trump.

Plus, Allan Smith dives into the success Democrats have found in elections so far this year. \n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n— Adam Wollner\n\nLawmakers in both parties ramp up their efforts to rein in Trump on tariffs\n\nBy Sahil Kapur and Scott Wong\n\nThe fallout from President Donald Trump’s aggressive new tariffs has spurred Congress into action, with a growing number of Republicans joining Democrats to express interest in using their power to restrain him. \n\n1. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, introduced a bill with Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., that would reassert Congress’ authority and slap restrictions on the president’s power to levy tariffs. \n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., praised Grassley for the bill because “he does believe that we’re a coequal branch.” He said he’d vote for it, though it’s unclear if the bill will be brought to the Senate floor.\n\n2. That move came after four Senate Republicans delivered a rare rebuke to Trump on Wednesday evening, joining with every Democrat to pass a measure to revoke his tariffs on Canada. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., the author of the resolution, said he’s looking to build on that success with more bills to block Trump’s tariffs. \n\nHe said “many more” than four Republicans were interested in his resolution than ultimately voted for it, predicting that more will come aboard “as the economic reality sets in.”\n\n3. Across the Capitol, senior House Democrats said they were looking to pass a resolution halting Canadian tariffs, similar to what the Senate voted on this week. Since Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is reluctant to show any daylight with Trump, Democrats are exploring an end run around House GOP leaders. \n\nRep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., said he would file what’s known as a discharge petition, a legislative tool that would allow supporters to bypass GOP leaders and force a vote on legislation if they can secure 218 signatures. At least one moderate Republican, Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, said he would consider supporting it. \n\nStocks plunge: Major U.S. stock indexes on Thursday saw their worst one-day drops since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Rob Wile reports.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 4.8%, while the Nasdaq fell 6% — both their worst since 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 4%, or more than 1,600 points — its worst sell-off since 2022.\n\nTrump doesn’t budge: Still, Trump downplayed any panic over his new tariffs.\n\n“The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom,” Trump told reporters. \n\nFollow live tariffs coverage →\n\nDemocratic performance is improving in a slew of elections this year, as a weary party looks for signs of hope\n\nBy Allan Smith\n\nDemocrats have spent the first months of President Donald Trump’s second administration wandering the political wilderness — facing record-low popularity while competing factions battle over how exactly to take on the president.\n\nAnd yet, in special election after special election so far this year, Democrats are faring miles better against Republican opponents than they did last fall in Trump’s faceoff with Kamala Harris.\n\nIn 16 special state legislative and congressional elections held so far this year, Democrats have bettered their margin of victory or defeat compared to the 2024 Trump-Harris battle by an average of about 11.5 points, according to data collected by the political site The Downballot. The Democrat overperformed in 14 of those 16 contests, including flipping deep-red state Senate districts in Iowa and Pennsylvania. \n\nThose trends continued Tuesday. In Florida, though Republicans comfortably held on to two very pro-Trump House seats, Democrats improved on their margin of defeat in the 1st District by 22 points and by 16 points in the 6th District compared to Harris’ results there last fall. \n\nAnd in the high-profile Wisconsin state Supreme Court race that earned the most national attention of any of the contests held so far this year, liberal candidate Susan Crawford defeated conservative candidate Brad Schimel by 10 points, just months after Trump won the battleground state by less than a point. More than 2.36 million voters turned out in that race, only 300,000 or so fewer than did in the 2022 midterms. \n\nThe election results have injected a jolt of confidence in Democrats, who’ve had little to celebrate since Trump’s win in November and as he and Elon Musk aggressively pursue substantial cuts to federal programs and workforces.\n\nThat’s all From the Politics Desk for now.

Judgment and maturity may be more crucial. But Trump is no ordinary dunce. He displays a stubborn stupidity that threatens to plunge the world into chaos and potentially into depression.\n\nIt should go without saying that our constitutional system was never meant to be so vulnerable to the whims and fantasies of one man. Nothing as critical as the entire world trading system or the maintenance of the NATO alliance should be decided by which side of the bed the emperor woke up on today, but due to the cowardice and cupidity of the GOP and others, we’ve gradually lost our antibodies to strongman rule and find ourselves bowing before a power-drunk man/child.\n\nHis peculiar blind spots and obsessions now threaten everyone. All of those supposedly worldly-wise Wall Street types who either supported or did not oppose Trump’s return to power deserve some of the blame today. One thinks of Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, who has a long history opposing tariffs but was becalmed to the point where he told a Davos audience in January that tariffs are a good “economic weapon” and that critics should “get over it.”\n\nThis kind of insouciance in the face of a severe economic threat is breathtaking. Even if Wall Street executives and others who chose to believe that Trump was preferable to Kamala Harris were indifferent to the civil liberties implications of a Trump second term and uninterested in public health and the administration of justice, you’d think they’d be interested in their own bottom lines. You would think they might have noticed that one of Trump’s only long-term convictions was that America had been victimized by world trade and that tariffs would solve all of our problems.\n\nTrump has an obsession with trade. He always has, and his views are wrong historically, economically and even morally. At his Rose Garden declaration of “Liberation Day” he repeated his oft-stated view that the U.S. has been “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far” for 50 years and more. Long-term trade deficits, he declared, are a “national emergency” that “threaten our way of life.”\n\nIn vain did a procession of first-term advisers attempt to disabuse Trump of his absurd views about trade. They patiently explained that it is Americans, not foreigners, who pay tariffs. He was deaf to this. They noted that trade deficits are not a measure of wealth, far less who is “winning” or “losing.” If we buy coffee from Costa Rica and they buy nothing from us (which isn’t true, but just as an illustration), in no sense has Costa Rica taken advantage of, far less “raped,” America. We gave them dollars and they gave us coffee in return. That is called commerce, and nearly every exchange between a willing buyer and willing seller yields two winners, not one. Besides, as those first-term Trump advisers also tried to convey, those Costa Rican businessmen then take those dollars and buy American assets.\n\nThe global trading system the United States shepherded into existence in the post-World War II era has been a boon to people around the globe, and no one has benefited more than the people of the United States. We’ve run trade deficits with many nations for many reasons. Sometimes that’s a reflection of savings versus investment rates in other countries (think Germany). Sometimes it’s a reflection of relative wealth (Vietnamese consumers can’t afford to purchase as many American products as Americans can afford to purchase of Vietnamese products). But in any case, it doesn’t really matter because countries that run big trade deficits can be super wealthy. The United States has run trade deficits since the late 1970s and has also been the richest nation on the globe during those years. In fact, even during Trump’s first term, which he has widely proclaimed to have been the greatest economy in the history of the universe, we ran consistent trade deficits. In fact, the trade deficit increased during the first Trump administration from $481 billion in 2016 to $679 billion in 2020.\n\nIn a saner world, Trump’s delusions would not guide U.S. policy. They’d be checked by his own advisers, the Congress and the public. But here we are.\n\nThis is not the first time in history that a leader’s misconceptions have been implemented on a broad scale, but you have to reach into the history of dictatorial regimes to find parallels. In the Soviet Union in the 1930s, the ideas of agronomist Trofim Lysenko gained acceptance not because they were true but because Stalin wanted them to be true. Lysenko promised a new golden age with dramatically improved crop yields that would transform even Siberia into a paradise of orchards and gardens. This was touted by Stalin as the “new biology” and ruthlessly enforced. Naysayers were arrested and executed. The result was repeated famines in the USSR and in China, where Mao also embraced the fallacy. Millions of men, women and children starved to death because a leader was able to impose his fantasies on a whole society.\n\nGlobal trade is an engine of prosperity, and one man’s stupidity now threatens billions.\n\nMona Charen is policy editor of The Bulwark and host of the “Beg to Differ” podcast.\n\nSend letters to letters@suntimes.com\n\nGet Opinions content delivered to your inbox.

Democrats have held both of the state’s Senate seats since 2017. The party would need to flip four Republican-held seats in 2026 to take back control of the chamber.\n\nOther politicians who have publicly expressed interest in running for the New Hampshire seat include Representative Maggie Goodlander, a first-term Democrat who is the state’s other member of Congress; former Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican who served for eight years before declining to seek re-election last year; and Scott Brown, a Republican former Massachusetts senator who ran unsuccessfully for a New Hampshire Senate seat in 2014.\n\nIn his announcement video, Mr. Pappas faintly echoes some of the arguments long made by a next-door neighbor, Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont.\n\n“People, regardless of their politics, have a sense that the system is not working, that there are special interests and big corporations that have outsized influence in our political system,” Mr. Pappas says. “Everywhere we go, we hear it: veterans, parents, small-business owners, people who have done everything right asking, ‘Why does it feel like the system’s rigged?’”\n\nSuch commentary explained a bit about the political moment Democrats find themselves in.\n\nHaving been swept out of power last year as voters again demanded change, Democratic candidates for office in 2026 and beyond are branding themselves as agents of the next round of changes. This time, they are entertaining discussions of systemic shake-ups that were politically untenable for President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Vice President Kamala Harris to campaign on last year.","summary":"Mr. Pappas, a 44-year-old Democratic congressman, is the first major candidate to enter the race to succeed the retiring Senator Jeanne Shaheen.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/politics/chris-pappas-new-hampshire-senate.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/03/multimedia/03pol-pappas-topart-kzpq/03pol-pappas-topart-kzpq-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 20:42:45","author":"Reid J.

I won’t be a stranger, and I’ll be reading your unparalleled work every single day.”\n\nBezos, the billionaire Amazon owner, said in February that the left-leaning publication’s opinion pages would shift their coverage to better reflect American values like “personal liberties and “free markets.”\n\nRobinson, who has written for the op-ed page since 2005, is the third Washington Post staffer to leave the paper since Bezos’ edict.\n\nEx-opinion editor David Shipley quit as soon as the revamp was announced, and longtime columnist Ruth Marcus departed in March, after she said publisher Will Lewis “spiked” a column “expressing concern” over Bezos’ new direction for the section.\n\nRobinson joined the newspaper in 1980 and won a Pulitzer Prize in 2009 for his columns on the 2008 presidential campaign, focusing on Barack Obama’s rise to the presidency. \n\nHe is also the author of “Coal to Cream: A Black Man’s Journey Beyond Color to an Affirmation of Race” and “Last Dance in Havana.”\n\nA Washington Post spokesperson congratulated Robinson on his retirement.\n\n“For 45 years, his reporting and commentary spanned continents and beats, earning countless recognitions, including a Pulitzer Prize. Eugene’s strong perspective and impeccable integrity have regularly shaped our public discourse, cementing his legacy as a leading voice in American journalism,” the rep said.\n\nDuring his time at the paper, he emerged as one of its most vocal critics of President Trump, calling him a “weak, narcissistic man” in 2017. In February, he wrote that Trump “tramples the Constitution, vandalizes the federal government and trashes our vital international alliances.”\n\nRobinson will continue his role as chief political analyst at NBC News and MSNBC.\n\nHis departure comes as Bezos and Lewis are steering the paper toward a more centrist position, to the dismay of many current and former Washington Post journalists, including its ex-executive editor Marty Baron.\n\nBaron had slammed Bezos for blocking the newspaper’s editorial board from endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. \n\nAt the time, Bezos defended his decision, saying that endorsing Harris would have added a “perception of bias” to their coverage.","summary":"Robinson, who worked for The Washington Post's op-ed page since 2005, told staffers that he has decided to leave the outlet due to a \"significant shift\" in the section's mission.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/03/media/columnist-eugene-robinson-exits-washington-post-after-jeff-bezos-significant-shift-in-papers-mission/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/101618710.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 20:24:09","author":"Alexandra Steigrad","authors":["Alexandra Steigrad"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.394},{"id":307422432,"title":"INVESTIGATION: Trump's Astonishingly Lawless Second Term Revealed — From Making Government 'Secret and Cruel' to Building His Personal Fortune","text":"In just the first few months of his second turn in charge, Donald Trump has channeled Jerry Maguire's favorite mantra: \"Show me the money!\"\n\nSince re-taking the presidential office in January, RadarOnline.com can reveal Trump has awarded some high-profile government deals to big businesses that are willing to line his personal coffers.As U.S. stock markets plummet Thursday in light of controversial and sweeping new tariffs issued by Trump on foreign businesses, the president isn't worried about losing much of his personal wealth, which he has been finding new ways to inflate with his new office. \n\nAlmost immediately after his overwhelming victory over Kamala Harris in November, Trump offered opportunities for top CEOs and corporate executives to meet with him – as long as they were willing to travel to and pay for a stay at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nSenior staffers at lobbying outfits and a variety of corporate giants immediately began planning worker retreats, galas, and annual meetings at Mar-a-Lago and other Trump branded golf resorts and event spaces – with the costs and fees of those trips being paid directly to Trump.\n\nIt was apparently all part of Trump's plan to cash-in on the Oval Office, after privately discussing jacking up the price for membership at his personal clubs because members are \"paying to see the president.\"According to Wired, Trumps Super PAC charged $1million per seat at Mar-a-Lago events with the president – with one-on-one meetings going for upwards of $5million.\n\nOne D.C. insider referred to these payments as \"tips\" for the president. \n\nEven the first lady has been clearing some big bucks with personal deals – like the $40million Melania Trump is getting from Amazon for a documentary one insider said, \"nobody asked for.\"\n\nIt's expected that most of the money will go directly to Melania.Trump's financial attacks on foreign nations is not just creating havoc to much-needed goods and services, it's also leading to a halt in critical tourism dollars.\n\nFederal statistics reveal overseas visitors to the U.S. dropped 2.4 percent in February 2025 – the first full month of Trump’s presidency – when compared to the same time last year.\n\nTrump and his administration have made it clear they are focused on booting illegal immigrants from the country, with horror stories of temporary visitors with harmless itineraries said to have found themselves imprisoned.Tourism Economics, an industry research firm, has already predicted a 5.1 percent drop in overseas travelers to America for 2025, after previously forecasting an 8.8 percent gain.\n\nTrump's obsession with tariffs has also hit the country hard as stocks took a tumble after the former reality star announced broad tariffs starting at 10 percent. Just minutes following Trump's declaration, the S&P 500 fell two percent and the Nasdaq saw a three percent slip – the steepest decline since the 2020 Covid pandemic. \n\nOne resident from Canada visiting California for the Game Developers Conference (GDC) said: \"(My friend) didn't come because they were afraid.

Now She’s Running for Congress","text":"Deja Foxx, a 24-year-old content creator with a TikTok following of nearly 143,000, launched her candidacy this week for the special election in Arizona’s Seventh Congressional District, following Representative Raúl Grijalva’s passing last month. A crowded primary to fill the vacancy is already shaping up, with candidates including Grijalva’s own daughter, a progressive advocate who is a member of the Pima County Board of Supervisors, and former state representative Daniel Hernández Jr., who helped save Gabby Giffords while serving as her intern when she was shot in 2011.\nBut the stacked field of competitors isn’t stopping Foxx from throwing her hat in the ring. A community activist in her own right, the Columbia graduate generated an online following by advocating for reproductive health and education—something she has been doing in Tucson for years with organizations like Planned Parenthood.\nIn 2019, the same year she served as an influencer and surrogate strategist on former vice president Kamala Harris’s first presidential campaign, Foxx started GenZ Girl Gang, a digital community for young women. She hosts Girls on the Ground, a vertical video series in which she interviews female politicians, and has posted videos with everyone from Harris to Texas representative Jasmine Crockett and Arizona senator Mark Kelly. Foxx was one of the few Gen Z’ers to deliver a prime-time speech at the Democratic National Convention, and she helped boost Harris’s profile online and in Arizona in 2024.\nIn a conversation with Vanity Fair, Foxx shares why this moment is ripe for a generational shake-up, and how experience building community online isn’t just an asset but a requirement for Democratic candidates moving forward. Our conversation below has been edited lightly for length and clarity.\nVanity Fair: What do Gen Z candidates bring to the table that the old guard doesn’t? Was that a factor in launching your campaign for Congress?\nDeja Foxx: Gen Z brings a sense of urgency to the table that a lot of older Dems are simply lacking. Young people are the ones that are thinking about affordable housing through the frame of, I want to move out of my parents house, and month after month, I save and I don’t get closer; thinking about wanting to own a home and feeling like it’s unattainable. Gen Z is the generation that’s left holding the bag when it comes to climate change and bad policy, right? And not only that, but for folks like me, and women like me, we’re the first generation to have less rights than our mothers or grandmothers. And so what I think young people are bringing to the table is a renewed sense of urgency that actually matches this moment, one in which we see authoritarianism on the rise.\nThe media-personality-to-politician pipeline was always a thing. But now we have the Gen Z influencer-to-politician pipeline. What does that mean to you? And do you embrace or reject that label?\nLet’s be clear, I was an activist first, who knew how to use digital in a smart way. My very first viral video was me bird-dogging. (That’s an organizing term where you sort of show up and catch a member of Congress or someone in power off guard, catch them saying something, back them into a corner—not physically, obviously.) Anyway, my first viral video was at a town hall with my then senator, Republican senator Jeff Flake, after he voted to repeal Title X funding, the funding that I relied on to access birth control when I didn’t have money, didn’t have parents, didn’t have insurance. And so I want to be very clear that, for me, my roots are in activism, and they are in organizing, and I have always found ways to use social media as a tool.\nAnd that’s no different now. I have built a community online that is excited about progressive candidates, newer candidates, young people, because they’re really looking for a sense of excitement and change in a party that many of them feel has left them behind, and many are experiencing, or have experienced, one of their first really big losses. When we think about maybe some of those younger women who follow me, or younger folks who follow me, that are in that 18-to-24 range, this last election was probably really hard on their morale. What I’m thinking about here is that I have been ear-to-the-ground. I’ve been reading the comment sections on my videos and on others’, taking temperature on the cultural conversation that young people are having online. And when I was making my decision to jump into this race, to launch this campaign, I did an interview at an Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders rally here in Tucson—where 23,000 people showed up—one in which I asked young people, “What are you looking for in new Democratic leadership?” And they responded [that] they were looking for newer and younger faces, real progressive action, and someone who had grit and fight.\nThe nature of what it means to be a political figure is evolving in and of itself, and an ability to create and maintain community on digital spaces isn’t just an asset; it is becoming a requirement. And so I don’t know if I reject or embrace the label wholeheartedly on either end. But I do see it as a tool, and one that I’m uniquely suited to use.\nTalking about influencers, former vice president Kamala Harris lost despite leveraging influencers. I’m curious, from your perspective, did she leverage the wrong ones, or did she leverage the right ones poorly?\nI sort of reject the question, because we have to look at the structures in which we’re playing. These tech companies are owned by [a] billionaire boy club who lined up behind Trump at his inauguration. It’s no surprise that the algorithms they’ve created—the platforms we use every day that shape our economies and our elections—favor the interests of rich white men like them. So I sort of reject the question that she used influencers the wrong way, or that we were the wrong influencers, but rather think we should have an expanded look at the systems and the structures in which we’re operating.\nListen, [I’m] someone who creates content around my abortion advocacy work. I’ve been censored on TikTok. And so when we’re talking about issues like reproductive rights, like abortion, on platforms that are hostile to them and punish us—or rather, limit our speech because of it—our side is actually, in some ways, set up to fail. So we see that. There was that Media Matters study. The lion’s share of followers are going to the right. And I think that that’s not because we don’t have the personalities for it. I would argue that it’s actually the incentives of the people building these companies.\nIf that is true, how do Democrats overcome that?\nRunning in a race like this in a congressional district is interesting. It’s not a presidential race. This is about my neighbors. These are the kids that I went to elementary, middle school, and high school with. This is where I was born and raised. And so a congressional race like this really balances both a national presence with a local, grassroots strategy. And so for someone like me, who’s been using social media for the last decade in my activism work, I’m thinking really critically about how I’m using broadcast channels on Instagram. Even today, I sent a voice memo to my “AZ Alerts” broadcast channel, where I’ve been sharing protests and clips from town halls and interviews with electives, and most recently I shared with them just a personalized voice memo about how today was going, about how [my] launch was going.\nIf we’re not mobilizing the right people in the right places, and this is true of my constituents in Arizona 07—if I’m not talking to them, then I’m not achieving my goal. If I’m not moving them to action, to sign our petition, show up, and volunteer on our day of action, then I’ve lost sight.\nUnderstanding the local nature of it, how should Democrats broadly be fighting back against President Donald Trump right now? And does it take playing into the attention economy that he captures?\nYes and yes. One of the reasons I decided to run in this primary is because I was out at [Trump’s] joint address [to Congress], doing interviews with electeds, talking to them about what their plans were for the evening, how they were thinking about this moment. And I left kind of disappointed. It was actually the day that I started my conversations about running for this seat, even though it had not opened up yet in a special election. I was still looking ahead at 2026 at the time. But what I saw there was that so many of these electeds were unable to meet the moment in a messaging sense. And we know that the majority of them vote the same way most of the time.\nBut one of the key differences, and what I’ve been hearing from young people on the ground, is that they don’t feel fought for. In this moment where Donald Trump and Elon Musk are calling people who rely on Social Security or SNAP benefits or Section 8 housing—people like my family—“the parasite class,” people want someone who's going to be a fighter, and that means showing up and disrupting. And it’s about the message. It’s about the delivery. It’s about being courageous.\nThat’s one of the most special things about the seat that I’m running for here in Arizona. It has a very strong progressive legacy, with former member Raúl Grijalva, and it is one of the seats in Arizona where someone could really be bold, because of its nature of being sort of a safer seat. We need to be, in every primary, asking ourselves, How are we best using the power of this seat? Some seats are going to come up in 2026 and they’re going to be absolutely critical to win, to win the majority. And we can’t count any seat out, not even the one I’m running for. This has to be held by a Dem, and we know that, and that’s why we have healthy primaries, so we can send the best person.\nThis is obviously already a crowded race, including the former representative’s own daughter. How do you plan to differentiate yourself from the pack, given the timing of the special election?\nI know I’m already an outsider candidate. I’m young. I’m working-class. I’m someone who has been engaged with politics on the other side of the dais. I’ve been an issue-based organizer, I’ve been an activist, and I’ve been a content creator as well. There’s already a clear difference here about what we bring to the table, and the argument I’m making to voters here in my hometown and beyond in CD-07, is that this moment calls for more than a politician. And that goes exactly to your point earlier. The question around this is not just a chaotic political moment. This is a chaotic moment for media, for attention, for our understanding of what is true. We need people who are going to go to DC and be loud, who are going to share our message and our stories in a way that resonates with people. And that’s not just about the words we use, though I think that’s part of it too, but also the strategies. And that’s going to be everything from the community-organizing piece, the door-knocking, to getting outside, talking to folks, to using social in a really smart way, because it’s where so many young people in particular are getting their news and building a political understanding.\nWho are some of your role models?\nOne person that comes to mind is the first Planned Parenthood organizer who ever brought me into this movement. Her name is Melissa, and she really taught me what organizing was. She saw my potential at a time where I was experiencing homelessness. I had just moved out of my mom’s house because of issues of substance abuse. I was figuring out how to be in a new home, and on my own, and working at a gas station, and I’ll never forget that. She invited me to a storytelling training, and I told her I couldn’t make it. And she went just a little bit further. She asked me why, and I told her that it was because I didn’t have access to transportation. I didn’t have a car. And she told me just a few words that really changed my life and taught me what it means to be an organizer, which was that she would give me a ride. And so when we think about the sort of values I hope to capture in the next 100 days of this race and beyond, it’s that. It’s about meeting people where they’re at, engaging people who have been left behind by just offering them the chance to get involved.\nIn what way have your political views evolved over the last few years, if at all, and what has contributed to any shift in ideology?\nDonald Trump has shaped the entirety of [my] political consciousness. It’s almost hard to remember a time before he was actively running [for] president or in office. About a decade now. And so how my political views have changed over the years, especially the last year or so since this presidential election, is that I felt really let down. I felt hopeful in 2024 that we were going to be able to do something big here, like not just fend off Donald Trump, but make some history-making ground with a history-making candidate, and we got our results back. We got a clear look at where the country and where voters were at in that moment. And I think for a lot of young folks, a lot of women, a lot of folks of color, a lot of working-class people, that was a really tough pill to swallow. I know it was for me.\nBut I can tell you what hasn’t changed. I have organized since before Donald Trump was president—even the first term—right through his first administration, under a Democratic president, and under Trump again, and what I know to be true is that when we invest in people, when we invest in folks’ organizing potential, there’s storytelling superpower, building relationships that we never really lose. I am in this work with some of the same people, organizers like Melissa, that I was in it with a decade ago. And so for folks who are feeling a little hopeless right now or unsure what they can do, I ask of them to find their community and really invest in it, because win or lose elections, that’s what's going to be there.\nCan you describe your first political memory?\nThis is actually very sad, but when I was growing up—I grew up here in Tucson, born and raised, and one of my first political memories was the Gabby Giffords shooting, that act of political violence against a woman in politics, a woman who had taken up leadership. I’ll be so honest with you. When I decided to get into this race, one of the hard conversations I had to have with my family, with my loved ones, and with myself, was if I was willing to put myself at risk to that kind of political violence. I recognized that running as a young woman, as a person of color, as a working-class person, as someone with a bold progressive vision, that I’m sticking my head up in a way that is different from other candidates when they join, just by the nature of being so young, by being so visible. That’s my first political memory, and it has informed the seriousness, the gravity with which I have made the decision to get into this race, knowing that even in an environment like this—where extremism is on the rise and there’s a real threat, often to the safety of women like me who stick our head up to lead—I do it anyway.\nWhat’s the most Gen Z thing about you? And the least?\nThe least Gen Z thing about me is that I still use a paper planner every morning. And the most Gen Z thing about me—I feel like Gen Z just has this, like, ‘Why not me?’ spirit. And I know that doesn’t resonate with a lot of older generations, who think we should wait our turn or that we need to be quiet.\nDemocrats have a bad rap right now, and I’m curious how you plan to change that narrative?\nThat’s what primaries are all about, right? In a moment where young people feel really frustrated with the Democratic Party, and rightfully so, I think that’s what primaries can help us with, by putting names on the ballot that give us difference. Difference in experience, difference in approach and ideology and background. People, just more than anything, deserve options. And I think that’s what I can offer to this race—by getting into this primary, I am giving people an opportunity to select, to vote for, to get excited about, to mobilize on behalf of someone who, I think, as a candidate, can really resonate with a lot of their lived experiences.","summary":"Deja Foxx, the 24-year-old activist vying to represent Arizona’s Seventh District, discusses how Democrats can resist Donald Trump’s “billionaire boy club” with a hyperlocal approach to organizing that engages “people who have been left behind.”","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/gen-z-influencer-kamala-harris-congress-democrats","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/67eea4fa110a82d7842ddd3a/16:9/w_2000,h_1125,c_limit/Deja-Foxx-for-Congress.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 19:42:02","author":"Rachel Janfaza","authors":["Rachel Janfaza"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.08},{"id":307409376,"title":"Cracker Barrel's Hot New Country Girl Breaks Down, CNN Made Trump Orange & I'd Like To Tariff Dumb Libs","text":"Happy Tariff Freakout Day to everyone!

Either because A) the president didn't want to tank his 'legacy' (Obama), or B) the president was too stupid to figure it out (Biden). Take your pick. Sack up. Now, let's get to the #sports! While I'm annoyed, let's go ahead and check in with the snobs over at CBS and Augusta National: CNN, Billy Burr & what a crowd! God, this is so stupid. I love rich, white conservatives as much as anyone, but the fellas at Augusta National just piss me off sometimes. \"We’re covering the tournament the way it is presented to us and the way the club would like to present it. So [before-and-after images are] not in the cards,\" CBS’s lead golf producer Sellers Shy stated. More than anything, this is likely an optics-based decision for CBS and Augusta National. Helene devastated the region, causing immense amounts of property damage and nearly 250 reported fatalities. Discussing how the hurricane took down a few trees on a golf course seems a bit distasteful in that context. My God. You know who I'd like to tariff? The dummy who wrote that last sentence. Oh, it's distasteful to show damage from a hurricane in a place that prides itself on the magnolias and azaleas it shoves down our throats every April? Really? Is it? That would be like not showing the City of New Orleans during the first Saints game back in town. Or not showing downtown New York City after 9/11 when the Yankees and Mets returned to action. It happened. These are things that happened – right in your backyard. There was damage on the course. Show the damn damage and move the hell on. God, we're dumb. Rapid-fire time before I start tariffing my kids for not cleaning this mess of a living room. First up? Let's check in with the folks over at CNN! Par for the course for those Libs. No SHOT they know what a tariff is. I bet they can't even spell it. PS: no clue if this was intentional or not, but, let's be honest, they've done farrrrrrrrrrr worse. This is kid's play compared to some of the nonsense that's come out of the network over the years. Next? From one dumb Lib to the next! I wrote about Bill Burr a few weeks back, and I'm more convinced than ever that he's just so full of shit at this point. What has happened to this dude? I don't get it. The above clip is old-school Bill Burr. It's what he used to be. I loved that guy. But it sort of loses some luster after Bill's spent the past months weirdly attacking Elon Musk and Trump – both on The View and The Breakfast Club. So, he was qualified to dump on them to those insufferable shows, but now he's all of a sudden silent? Huh? I don't get it! This guy is the biggest flip-flopper I've ever seen! He's the perfect Dem! Can't wait to get his thoughts on tariffs. Should be a doozy. Finally … let's wind down and head out to a ball game today to decompress! Take us home, Emily Ann! Now, a couple caveats here. No. 1: there WAS a rain delay yesterday. Fair is fair, and that needs to be said, because that above video is going viral right now, and it ain't because of all the Byron Buxton fans out there. That being said, it's a wild thing to see. There's just … nobody there. It's jarring to see. And it sucks, because Chicago is a baseball town. I do feel for White Sox fans. I grew up in the Frank Thomas/Paul Konerko/Mark Buehrle era, and buddy, it was an insane little ride. Sad. As if life, though.

Joe Biden's staff went to great lengths to keep him looking competent in the last few months of his presidency. From using fluorescent tape to guide his movements to struggling with debate preparation, forthcoming books have revealed internal fears about his declining cognitive abilities, as per a report by the Daily Mail.As worries about his mental status increased, he struggled more and more to keep up the act, ultimately dropping out of the 2024 race.How did Biden’s aides try to manage his public appearances?According to aides, Biden was out of it and required guidance from fluorescent tape on the floor.Joe Biden was 'out of it' during his last stint in the White House, according to his aides, and required fluorescent tape to be affixed to the carpet to indicate his path during events.According to a senior aide, Ron Klain, the former president appeared to believe he was President of NATO rather than the United States when he was getting ready for his now-famous debate with Donald Trump, as per a report by the Daily Mail.For his upcoming book, Klain told Whipple, We sat around the table. Biden was just really tired, and he had answers on cards. The fact that he was so disconnected from American politics also caught my attention. He was simply utterly preoccupied with his conversations with NATO leadersRon Klain claimed that he just got really enamored with being the head of NATO. Klain wondered half-seriously if Biden thought he was president of NATO instead of the US, according to Whipple.ALSO READ: Blake Lively faces backlash from all corners amid the Justin Baldoni lawsuit; here's the latest incident Fluorescent Tape and Guided MovementsThe disclosures can be found in a number of recently published books about Biden's presidency. Over the coming months, at least four books exploring his decline will be published. Some of the new information is shocking, especially the details of what aides knew about the president's health and the steps they took to keep the public unaware of Biden's condition.Biden reportedly required fluorescent tape to help him navigate a fundraiser at New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy's (D) home after the debate with Trump in order to prevent him from getting lost. Biden required the trail of vivid markings to act as colorful bread crumbs [that] showed the leader of the free world where to walk, whereas politicians, like actors, have tape marks on the floor to ensure they are positioned correctly for the camera. Joe Biden required a teleprompter to speak to a small group of people on the patio during that fundraiser, but he still rambled and veered off topic despite its assistance. More damaging details are probably on the horizon.Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's book Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again is available on May 20.During Biden's presidency, Thompson was among the few reporters to voice concerns about his health. Biden admitted to having trouble walking after breaking his foot during the 2020 presidential campaign, stumbled and tripped multiple times while in office, and made a number of verbal blunders that tainted the messaging of his administration.Donald Trump frequently referred to Biden as Sleepy Joe and questioned his cognitive abilities during the 2024 campaign, raising concerns about his physical and mental well-being.What happened during Biden’s debate prep at Camp David?In an interview with author Chris Whipple, Ron Klain, Biden's two-year chief of staff and advisor during the 2024 campaign, detailed the six days the staff spent at Camp David attempting to prepare Biden for his one and only debate with Trump.The public's opinion of Biden was altered by the June 27th debate in Atlanta, despite the White House's defense of his health. Biden looked unsteady, had trouble answering questions, and was suffering from a cold. He was over-coached and over-practiced, according to some aides, rather than given time to recuperate from his illness.The debate debacle was the tipping point, ending his campaign and reshaping the Democratic Party’s future.Following that, it sparked a number of inquiries concerning Biden's candidacy's viability and his capacity for the position. Although they privately expressed concerns, Biden's family, friends, and aides publicly supported him. Republicans' accusations that Biden was unfit for the job were dismissed by Democrats, but some privately expressed concern that they were placing too much trust in an elderly man who was, at best, unfit.As Biden's struggles became untenable, leading Democrats like Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi privately asked him to withdraw. By July 21, he formally dropped out of the race, paving the way for Kamala Harris, who later lost the general election to Trump.Even though he had serious reservations about Biden's performance, Ron Klain is said to have objected to withdrawing him from the race. When his replacement as chief of staff, Jeff Zients, told him that Biden was withdrawing, Klain described it as a gut punch and an avoidable tragedy.FAQsWhy did Joe Biden's aides put fluorescent tape on the floor?Aides reportedly used fluorescent tape on the floor to guide Biden's movements at events, ensuring he followed the right path without requiring direct assistance.Why did Joe Biden withdraw from the 2024 presidential race?Following a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump, growing concerns about Biden's cognitive abilities prompted increased pressure from Democratic leaders, including Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi, leading to his withdrawal from the race.","summary":"New accounts reveal Joe Biden's aides went to great lengths to manage his appearances, using fluorescent tape to guide his movements and struggling with debate preparation.

Did the Media?","text":"Two reporters have released a book—Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House—that shines a new light on the extent of President Joe Biden's cognitive decline over the course of his reelection campaign. Amie Parnes of The Hill and Jonathan Allen of NBC News gained access to Biden's inner circle, discovering that top officials had grave concerns about Biden's fitness for the presidency; these concerns long predated the public's own awareness of the extent of his decline.\n\nIn fact, Vice President Kamala Harris had discussed plans for what to do in the event of Biden's sudden death—i.e., which judges she would want to swear her in as president. These plans were formulated by Jamal Simmons, a communications director who departed Harris' team in January 2023. In other words, Harris was thinking through worst-case scenarios as far back as then.\n\nBy the time of Biden's disastrous July debate with Donald Trump, the president's cognitive decline was so bad that aides had to help him navigate a home where a fundraiser was being held…by placing fluorescent tape on the floor to guide him from spot to spot. Parnes and Allen confirmed this shocking detail in an interview with me on Rising.\n\n Biden \"went to a small fundraiser. Fluorescent tape on the floor to guide him where needs to go…\" \"A small place, and it's like, fluorescent tape on the floor, pointing him wear to go. In a house.\" Insane details from @RisingTheHill's interview with @amieparnes and… pic.twitter.com/hO8LUY4teN — Robby Soave (@robbysoave) April 2, 2025\n\nThis fundraiser wasn't held in the Labyrinth of King Minos or something. It was held at the residence of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. He has a big house, to be sure—repairs and renovations to the mansion cost New Jersey taxpayers $862,000. Nevertheless, the fact that Biden needed flashy visual cues just to survive a friendly fundraising event obviously raised serious and immediate questions about his ability to fulfill the more demanding aspects of his job.\n\nAnd yet, top Biden surrogates maintained that he was totally capable of remaining president, even after he had exited his reelection campaign. Ron Klain, Biden's former chief of staff, asserted in August 2024 that Biden was \"clearly up to the job.\"\n\n\"He's doing it every day,\" said Klain. \"He's doing it successfully.\"\n\nKlain doesn't even have the excuse that he was obligated to say something positive about Biden because he worked for him. He was out of a job at that point.\n\nWell, Klain is finally admitting the truth. He told reporter Chris Whipple, who has also released a tell-all book on the real story of the Biden campaign, that he \"wondered half-seriously if Biden thought he was president of Nato instead of the US. 'He just became very enraptured with being the head of Nato,' he said.\"\n\nKlain scheduled a practice debate for Biden, which was supposed to run for 90 minutes, but Biden could only make it through 45 minutes, at which point \"the president's voice was shot and so was his grasp of the subject,\" writes Whipple, characterizing Klain's remarks. \"All he really could talk about was his infrastructure plan and how he was rebuilding America and 16 million jobs. He had nothing to say about his agenda for a second term.\" \n\nGiven all that, it's no wonder Biden lost. But it's also remarkable that he didn't actually resign the presidency, despite his obvious impairments. Of course, it seems that no one in his inner circle was willing to speak out about his incapacity until after it was too late.\n\nMedia reporters are certainly having a field day with all this—now. CNN's Jake Tapper has released a book on this subject: Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again. That's in addition to the books by Parnes, Allen, and Whipple. One can't help but wonder, however, why it took so long to get the real story. Maybe journalists weren't properly clued in to Biden's decline until after the debate? That's a bit hard to believe, though: At the very least, Special Counsel Robert Hur's claims some months earlier that Biden appeared to be an \"elderly man with a poor memory\" should have set off alarm bells.\n\nWatch my full interview with Parnes and Allen here.\n\nThis Week on Free Media\n\nI am joined by Amber Duke to discuss Trump's deportations, the tariffs, Luigi Mangione and the death penalty, and whether Mark Zuckerberg has truly renounced his ways.\n\nWorth Watching\n\nNintendo has announced a live-action Legend of Zelda movie, which is theoretically exciting but could disappoint me in just about a thousand different ways. Here, let me list them.\n\n Casting: I am begging Nintendo to be thoughtful about casting and pick actual teenagers to play Link and Zelda, not much older actors who happen to have famous faces. I like Zendaya and Tom Holland as much as everyone else, but can we please be a bit more creative? For Ganondorf, it's OK to ignore this, since he's an older character. My personal choice would be Dev Patel, who definitely has the right look, though he needs to practice his evil cackling and playing the organ. (I would also love to see Martin Short play the Happy Mask Salesman.) World building: This will be tricky. Stray too far from the source material and the production will quickly become some generic fantasy thing, but mirror it too closely and you'll have something that's basically just a video game. Like, should Link talk in this film, unlike in the games? Probably. Should he spend all his time pushing large crates around? Probably not. Storyline: I imagine the filmmakers intend to come up with their own plot that draws inspiration from the storylines of the games. (This is basically what happened with the largely successful Super Mario Bros. movie.) I would highly encourage them to borrow heavily from the older games that actually had pretty good stories: Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, The Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword. The two most recent installments, Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, are popular despite having very uninspiring plots. (The sole exception being the latter's villainous Yiga clan: Feel free to use them.) Time travel: Use it! This is an underrated and key aspect of the Zelda games. In several installments, Link uses his unique abilities to transverse parallel dimensions and timelines—exploiting the differences between them to great storytelling effect. For instance, in Ocarina, Link learns about a magic song that created a thunderstorm at an inopportune moment; later, he returns to the past and discovers that he was the one who caused the thunderstorm in the first place. Intriguing! Big film studios love multiverses and doppelgängers and time travel and are probably overusing said storytelling devices at this point; this is a movie that actually calls for them! Be weird: People like these games because they have personality and their own style. The Yiga clan is the best thing about Tears because they're weird, incompetent ninjas who patrol a vast underground, have ridiculous ACME-reminiscent technology, love bananas, worship frogs, and leave notes everywhere that read: Glory to Master Kohga. That's cool! \n\nActually, Nintendo could avoid all of these potential issues by simply green-lighting the draft script I put together like a decade ago.","summary":"Now the tell-all books are pouring in.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/04/03/joe-bidens-handlers-definitely-knew-did-the-media/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/04/MEGA1257593_022-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 18:52:25","author":"Christian Britschgi,Robby Soave","authors":["Christian Britschgi","Robby Soave"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.223},{"id":307386060,"title":"Ex-Biden official running in blue state gubernatorial race must tackle key issue amid skyrocketing costs","text":"California gubernatorial candidate and former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said the state may need to rein in its Medicaid program as it faces concerns about costs partly related to those in the country illegally using the system.

It did not have to happen. Not at all,\" he said during the latest episode of his \"Politics War Room\" podcast. JAMES CARVILLE OFFERS LOVE ADVICE TO YOUNG PROGRESSIVES FOLLOWING ‘LOVE IS BLIND’ POLITICAL BLOW-UP Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, reporters and co-authors of \"FIGHT: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,\" appeared on MSNBC this week to detail their book’s excerpt about Obama allegedly pushing for a primary, but getting shot down by other party leaders. \"President Obama absolutely did not think that Joe Biden should continue, according to our sources close to President Obama. And he also didn’t want Kamala Harris to be the replacement for Biden. He didn’t think that she was the best choice for Democrats, and he worked really behind the scenes for a long time to try to have a mini-primary, or an open convention,\" Allen told the network. Allen, an NBC News senior politics reporter, added that Obama called Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., to discuss a potential mini-primary, but the lawmaker headed him off by endorsing former Vice President Kamala Harris. \"Clyburn thought to himself, ‘This guy is going to try to rope me into the open convention thing, I better get my endorsement of Harris out there fast, so this is a short conversation,’\" Allen said. That same day, Biden endorsed Harris, and the party fell in line. Obama would eventually endorse Harris for president five days after Biden did.

Loomer reportedly bashed the employees on her shit list to the president in front of embattled National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, who defended them. \n\n CNN reported that the terminated individuals include Director for Intelligence Brian Walsh, Senior Director for Legislative Affairs Thomas Boodry, and Senior Director David Feith. All six NSC staffers were on Loomer’s list of targets, according to CNN.\n\n Loomer’s presence in the White House — especially on the day Trump unveiled a sweeping tariffs package — is surprising considering the pains the campaign took in the fall of 2024 to distance the president from the noxious conspiracy-monger. After Loomer appeared alongside Trump at an event commemorating 9/11 — which she once claimed was “an inside job” — MAGA insiders scrambled to dig a canyon between the two. Following the incident, CNN reported that Loomer had been instrumental in influencing some of Trump’s most insane statements during his 2024 campaign, including claims that Haitian migrants in Ohio were eating local pets, and unfounded accusations that former Vice President Kamala Harris was misrepresenting her Black and Indian heritage. \n\n One Trump national security official says bluntly to Rolling Stone: “Too many people here have feared since the [presidential] transition Laura Loomer putting your name on one of her lists. It’s a possibility that is discussed way more than I’d like. …She’s not even on staff and calling more shots than some actual officials.”\n\n Waltz’s office being in Loomer’s comes as the national security adviser is still trying to weather the fallout over revelations last month that he inadvertently added journalist Jeffrey Golberg to a Signal chat where high-ranking members of the Trump administration discussed sensitive attack plans against Yemen. On Wednesday, Politico reported that Waltz had, over the course of the first two months of the Trump administration, set up over 20 signal chats to discuss sensitive national security information. The Trump administration has tried to spin the national security scandal as no big deal.\n\n In a statement to Rolling Stone on Thursday, Loomer said: “Out of respect for President @realDonaldTrump and the privacy of the Oval Office, I’m going to decline on divulging any details about my Oval Office meeting with President Trump. It was an honor to meet with President Trump and present him with my research findings. I will continue working hard to support his agenda, and I will continue reiterating the importance of, and the necessity of STRONG VETTING, for the sake of protecting the President of the United States of America, and our national security.”\n\n It’s unclear what kind of vetting Loomer presented to the president, but she has placed a call on her social media for tips regarding “any Biden Holdovers who are sabotaging directives of the Trump admin.” \n\n “Are you sitting around wondering when the Biden holdovers will be removed from their positions so we can truly make America Great Again? Time to make them famous. DM me,” Loomer wrote Thursday, the day after her meeting with the president.","summary":"Laura Loomer is \"not even on staff and calling more shots than some actual officials,” one Trump official told Rolling Stone","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-fires-natsec-officials-meeting-laura-loomer-1235310177/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Laura-Loomer-and-NSC.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 18:33:17","author":"Asawin Suebsaeng,Nikki McCann Ramirez,Nikkimccannramirez","authors":["Asawin Suebsaeng","Nikki McCann Ramirez","Nikkimccannramirez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.087},{"id":307414738,"title":"Notorious internet bigot is now advising Trump on national security","text":"President Donald Trump has reportedly finally fired members of his National Security Council after consulting with racist conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer.

The New York Times reports that Loomer was seated directly across from Trump and Waltz defended his staff members during the exchange.\n\nBefore the meeting, Loomer has posted messages on social media complaining about Trump aide Alex Wong, who is Asian, and whom she accused of being part of a “foreign opp to embarrass the Trump administration on behalf of China.”\n\nLoomer is a conspiracy theorist who has described herself as “pro-white nationalism.” She has operated as a conservative activist and pundit for years. She also ran a failed congressional campaign in 2022. Loomer’s time in the public eye has been marked by a series of racist incidents and extremist rhetoric. For instance, she said the White House would “smell like curry” if Vice President Kamala Harris, who has South Asian ancestry, won the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIn spite of her persona, or perhaps because of it, she has been a member of Trump’s inner circle. In 2024, she accompanied him on his trip to New York City on the anniversary of 9/11, which is particularly notable because Loomer has promoted the false theory that the 9/11 attacks were an “inside job.”\n\nDuring that episode, longtime Trump ally Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina, said Loomer was “toxic,” noting that she once called for Trump aide Kellyanne Conway’s daughter “to hang herself.”\n\nThis is the person Trump is turning to for consultation on America’s most serious national security matters—and apparently, he’s acting on her advice. Discussing the security council with Loomer also undermines the White House’s claims that the leak case is “closed.”\n\nMultiple congressional lines of inquiry have emerged, with even a few Republicans signing on to a push for an independent investigation.\n\nTrump’s connection to Loomer once again highlights Trump’s love of conspiracies and racism, which is now intertwined with leaks involving the safety of all Americans.","summary":"President Donald Trump has reportedly finally fired members of his National Security Council after consulting with racist conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer.

They had plenty of donors and political allies in common. The rest of the party threw in with her. Where was Obama?\" The book, published earlier this month, is titled \"FIGHT: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House\" and details how Harris secured the support of key Democrats after Biden dropped out of the race. The authors revealed that Obama did not want Harris to run in Biden's place, because he felt she couldn't beat Trump. However, Obama spoke with Harris over the next couple of days, according to the book, and he found he was in a position where \"his actions against Biden and Harris could diminish him in the eyes of Democratic elites.\" TENSIONS ALLEGEDLY RISE BETWEEN BIDEN WHITE HOUSE AND HARRIS CAMPAIGN: 'TOO MUCH IN THEIR FEELINGS' Parnes and Allen added that Obama's reputation for loyalty to the Democratic Party was on the line. A person close to Obama said, \"there was a little bit of mending that had to be done,\" according to the book. Obama waited five days to endorse Harris after Biden had dropped out of the race. After some back-and-forth over the best way to showcase Obama's endorsement, with Harris campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon worried about cash, they recorded a video of Harris getting a call from Barack and Michelle Obama to post online. \"To seem real, Harris had to fake surprise and enthusiasm about what should have been an obvious endorsement from both Obamas. It took days of intense negotiations to strike a deal on the simplest act in politics. The whole frame, including the script, was designed to elevate the Obamas by making it look like she was begging for their blessing. This was typical bulls---,\" Allen and Parnes wrote.

How did the Signal leak happen?The controversy, dubbed Signalgate, erupted when Waltz mistakenly added The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to a Signal group chat discussing an attack on the Houthis in Yemen. The accidental inclusion of a journalist in a sensitive conversation raised serious concerns about national security and internal administration discipline.Despite the backlash, Trump has stood by Waltz, a former Florida congressman. However, some White House insiders have been less forgiving, labeling Waltz a f***ing idiot over the blunder.Who pushed for the firings?According to The New York Times, far-right activist Laura Loomer met with Trump in the Oval Office on Wednesday, reportedly presenting research claiming certain NSC staffers were insufficiently loyal to the president. Loomer’s visit, which was not officially disclosed, played a significant role in Trump’s decision to fire several officials.Loomer later told DailyMail.com, Out of respect for President Trump and the privacy of the Oval Office, I’m going to decline on divulging any details about my Oval Office meeting with President Trump. She added, It was an honor to meet with President Trump and present him with my research findings. Who were the officials removed?CNN reported that the following NSC staffers were fired:Brian Walsh – Director for intelligence, previously worked for Secretary of State Marco Rubio.Thomas Boodry – Senior director for legislative affairs, formerly Waltz’s legislative director in Congress.David Feith – Oversaw technology and national security, served in the State Department during Trump's first term.Notably, Loomer had initially targeted Alex Wong, Waltz’s deputy, citing his Chinese heritage and family connections. However, Wong was not among those dismissed.Why was Alex Wong targeted?Loomer publicly accused Wong of being untrustworthy due to his background. She criticized his wife’s former role in the Department of Justice under Obama and Biden and pointed out that her father had investments in a Chinese satellite company. I don't know why we have Chinese individuals in positions of national security, Loomer said in an online video.These comments sparked backlash, prompting Republican Senator Tom Cotton to defend Wong. Cotton posted on X (formerly Twitter), Alex Wong and his wife Candice are complete and total patriots, 100% MAGA Warriors who always put America First. What role did Marjorie Taylor Greene play in this controversy?Interestingly, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has tried to distance herself and the broader MAGA movement from Loomer. Greene had previously called Loomer’s rhetoric extremely racist, particularly after Loomer posted that if Kamala Harris won the presidency, the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center. Greene’s push to sideline Loomer, however, appears to have been unsuccessful, as Loomer remains close to Trump’s inner circle.What’s next for Trump’s national security team?With three key staffers gone, Trump’s national security team will likely undergo further restructuring. The dismissals highlight the ongoing power struggles within Trump’s White House, as figures like Loomer continue to wield influence over hiring and firing decisions.For now, the fallout from Signalgate continues, with questions remaining about how the administration will prevent further leaks and maintain national security discipline moving forward.FAQs:Why did Donald Trump fire National Security Council officials?

Vance lectured European leaders about their troubling retreat from free speech, calling their actions \"shocking to American ears\" and a threat to democracy itself. Yet new global survey data reveal a troubling incongruity in Vance's own backyard: Despite boasting the world's strongest constitutional protections, Americans' support for free speech is eroding dramatically, particularly among younger generations. \n\nAt a time when the Trump administration weaponizes power against its critics and the left increasingly equates speech with harm, America is losing its civil libertarian commitment precisely when this foundational right faces unprecedented pressures from both cultural intolerance and governmental overreach. If Americans fail to recognize and reverse this trend, the country's status as a beacon of free expression risks fading.\n\nThe 2025 Future of Free Speech Index, based on surveys conducted in 33 countries, places the United States ninth globally in free speech support—a respectable but hardly exceptional position. More concerning is the trajectory: The U.S. has experienced the third-largest decline in support for free speech since our previous survey in 2021, behind only Japan and Israel. \n\nThis phenomenon is part of a broader \"free speech recession\" happening globally, with twice as many countries showing substantial decreases in support for free expression as showing increases.\n\n But America's retreat is particularly notable given its unique constitutional protection and self-conception as free speech's foremost defender.\n\nIn fact, the strongest popular support for free speech is found in the Old World, with Norway and Denmark first and second and Sweden in the top five, along with two democratic backsliders: Hungary and Venezuela. These latter cases present a fascinating paradox—populations that strongly value free expression despite living under governments increasingly hostile to this right. This disconnect between \"demand\" for free speech and its actual \"supply\" suggests that citizens in these countries recognize what they're losing as their governments tighten restrictions.\n\nPerhaps the most concerning aspect of America's free speech recession is the generational divide in attitudes. Young Americans (ages 18 to 34) now show significantly less tolerance for controversial speech than their elders across every category we measured. The magnitude of these shifts since 2021 is remarkable:\n\n Support for allowing statements insulting the national flag has plummeted 28 percentage points among young adults. Willingness to tolerate speech supporting homosexual relationships has dropped 20 points. Acceptance of speech offensive to minority groups has declined 12 points. Tolerance for speech offensive to one's religion has fallen 14 points. \n\nThese aren't minor fluctuations—they represent fundamental shifts in values within a short period. While older Americans (ages 55 and over) have maintained relatively stable attitudes, showing only single-digit declines in most categories, the steep drops among younger cohorts raise profound questions about the future of free expression in America.\n\nCollege-educated Americans show another surprising shift. This group, traditionally associated with openness to diverse viewpoints, has markedly decreased its support for controversial speech since 2021.\n\nThese shifts defy simple partisan explanations. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris voters show identical support for government criticism (89 percent) and similar tolerance for flag insults. The partisan divide appears elsewhere. Trump supporters express higher tolerance for speech offensive to minorities (76 percent vs. 54 percent) and religion (80 percent vs. 74 percent), while Harris supporters more strongly back speech supporting homosexual relationships (83 percent vs. 78 percent).\n\nInterestingly, Trump supporters show greater support than Harris voters for media publishing information that might affect national security (47 percent vs. 35 percent) or economic stability (75 percent vs. 69 percent)—suggesting their commitment to free expression extends to areas where conservatives have traditionally favored restrictions.\n\nAmericans' shifting free speech attitudes coincide with a technological revolution. Since ChatGPT's 2022 launch, generative AI has achieved unprecedented adoption rates. This technology is fundamentally transforming how information is created and shared. Over 80 percent of American adults reported having used AI-enabled products, with frequent usage particularly high among younger Americans—the same demographic showing the steepest declines in free speech support.\n\nThis convergence presents a striking anomaly: While Americans eagerly adopt powerful new tools for expression, their tolerance for AI-generated sensitive content—such as deepfakes of politicians—remains low (21.5 percent), while support for government regulation of AI-generated speech is high (53 percent). Given that AI is being rapidly integrated into tools we use to interact with information and ideas (email, search, word processing, etc), government or corporate control of this technology could have profound consequences for free speech and access to information. \n\nDespite the decline in support, Americans still value free speech. But our survey findings should alarm all who share Frederick Douglass's view that free speech is the \"great moral renovator of society and government\". Left unchecked, the decline in support could reshape America's speech environment for generations. \n\nHowever, robust support for free speech is urgently needed in the present. President Trump and his administration intimidate media outlets with baseless lawsuits while weaponizing legitimate concerns about cancel culture and censorial Big Tech to impose government control over higher education and social media. The administration has even resorted to arresting and revoking visas and green cards based on speech otherwise protected by the First Amendment. \n\nBut this isn't a time for despair. American history provides instructive examples of how surges of intolerance can be reversed by appealing to the underlying principles of the First Amendment. \n\nJust seven years after ratifying the First Amendment, America faced one of its earliest tests of free speech. The Sedition Act of 1798, pushed by the Federalist Party and President John Adams, criminalized criticism of the government. Critics, led by Democratic-Republicans Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, saw it as a betrayal of the Constitution. Despite aggressive enforcement—including prosecutions of newspaper editors and citizens—the crackdown backfired. Republican newspapers doubled, public outrage grew, and Jefferson's election in 1800 marked a decisive rejection of government censorship. This early episode demonstrates how attempts to suppress dissent often fuel the very resistance they seek to quell.\n\nPrior to U.S. involvement in World War I, President Woodrow Wilson's warnings about \"the poison of disloyalty\" led to the first Red Scare, marked by mass prosecutions of peaceful dissenters. This period, however, sparked a turning point in free speech law. Harvard professor Zechariah Chafee emerged as a principled civil libertarian, influencing Supreme Court Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis. Their powerful dissents laid the foundation for modern First Amendment jurisprudence, establishing the U.S. as a global leader in protecting political expression. This history reminds us that even in moments of intolerance, principled advocacy can reshape the legal and cultural landscape.\n\nAmerica's free speech tradition stands at a critical crossroads. As political polarization deepens, social media fragments the public sphere, and AI rapidly transforms how we create and consume information, the vital benefits of free expression must once again be forcefully defended and clearly articulated.\n\nRestoring America's commitment to free speech requires intellectual humility and a willingness to course-correct across ideological divides. Those who dismiss cancel culture as a moral panic or view the First Amendment as a shield for harmful speech should reconsider how antispeech attitudes weaken the very mechanisms that empower marginalized voices. Conversely, conservatives who celebrated a Trump presidency as an antidote to left-wing censors must now confront the administration's troubling use of state power to silence critics. Protecting free speech demands a shared commitment, regardless of political loyalties—one that prioritizes principle over partisan advantage.\n\nFuture-proofing free speech in the digital age requires more than just resisting censorship—it demands redesigning online platforms to encourage context, transparency, and user control. Instead of centralized content bans or opaque algorithmic suppression, social media must empower users to make informed choices about their information environments, a policy that has been successfully implemented in Taiwan. \n\nThese are just the first steps in restoring America's commitment to free speech. The challenge ahead is ensuring that free expression remains a living principle—not just a convenient slogan—one that can withstand the pressures of political polarization, technological disruption, and shifting cultural tides.","summary":"A new global survey reveals a stark decline in Americans' support for free speech as the Trump administration tightens its grip on expression.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/04/03/survey-free-speech-support-is-eroding-in-america/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/04/4-3-25-v2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 16:00:10","author":"Jacob Mchangama,Veronique de Rugy","authors":["Jacob Mchangama","Veronique de Rugy"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.109},{"id":307340612,"title":"Neal Katyal's Law Firm Striking Trump Deal Stuns MSNBC Viewers","text":"MSNBC viewers were caught off guard after reports surfaced that Neal Katyal's law firm had struck a deal involving Donald Trump—a move that appears at odds with Katyal's outspoken legal critiques of the former president.Newsweek has contacted Katyal and his law firm, Milbank, for comment via email.Why It MattersNeal Katyal, the former acting solicitor general of the United States and legal analyst for MSNBC, is a frequent critic of Donald Trump. He previously criticized Trump's attempt to delay his hush money trial, in which the president was convicted. He also joined a lawsuit against Trump in February, challenging the Republican president's effort to remove the head of a key agency that hears cases brought by federal government workers who are fired or disciplined. He also wrote a book making the case for impeaching Trump.Owing to Katyal's track record of opposing Trump, MSNBC viewers were surprised to find that the law firm he is part of has struck a deal with Trump. The settlements come amid widespread concern over the U.S. president's attempts to target law firms linked to his political opponents, with critics viewing these actions as a thinly veiled anti-democratic effort to intimidate lawyers from representing cases against the administration.What To KnowMilbank, the law firm at which Katyal is a partner, has reached a deal with the Trump administration to avoid executive orders that could significantly harm their business, Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Wednesday.According to Trump's post, Milbank has committed $100 million in pro bono legal services to causes backed by the Trump administration, including support for veterans, active-duty military members, and individuals facing injustices in the criminal justice system.The firm also pledged to use a merit-based system, refrain from \"illegal D.E.I. discrimination,\" and ensure that clients are not denied representation based on their political views.The settlement follows similar agreements recently announced by Trump with two other major law firms: Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and Willkie Farr & Gallagher. Kamala Harris's husband, Doug Emhoff, joined Wilkie Farr & Gallagher in January and told the firm it should not settle with Trump, according to the New York Times.But it was Milbank's deal that raised eyebrows this week. MSNBC viewer Peg Manley expressed her disappointment on X, calling Neal Katyal a \"coward\" unless he quits under protest, stating she wouldn't watch MSNBC when he's on. Similarly, Bluesky users criticized Katyal, with one accusing him of losing credibility. MSNBC viewer and former lawyer Jon Jackson also criticized Neal Katyal on X, saying that every law firm that has fought back against Trump's illegal Executive Orders has won. He argued that Katyal's decision to cave is worse than giving up.Meanwhile, Marc Elias, founder of Democracy Docket, weighed in, noting that big law firms have the choice to either \"capitulate or stand tall,\" with \"history watching.\"There is a deep divide in the legal community over how to respond to Trump's efforts to punish lawyers. Three firms – Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, and WilmerHale – have all sued and successfully obtained court orders to partially block the executive orders. Covington and Burling, another major firm targeted by Trump due to its legal support for Jack Smith, has not taken any public action.However, many of the country's most prominent law firms have declined to speak out against the orders. Trump himself has boasted about how easy it has been to get firms to comply.\"They're all bending and saying: 'Sir, thank you very much.' Nobody can believe it,\" Trump said last month. \"Law firms are just saying: 'Where do I sign? Where do I sign?'\"What People Are SayingMSNBC viewer Peg Manley wrote on X: \"Cowards unless Neal Katyal quits under protest.

That way the octogenarian would know where to go without having to have an aide guide him.\n\nAnd one top aide said the then-president was so out of it during preparation for his now infamous debate with Donald Trump that he thought he was ‘President of NATO’ rather than the United States.\n\nThe revelations are found in several books coming out about Biden’s presidency. At least four tomes are coming out over the next few months examining his decline and legacy.\n\nSome of the new information is eye-opening, particularly when it comes to what aides knew about the president’s health and the actions they took to conceal Biden’s condition to the public. \n\nRon Klain, who served as Biden’s chief of staff for two years and advised him during the 2024 campaign, described to author Chris Whipple the six days the staff spent at Camp David, trying to get Biden into shape for his first and only debate with Trump.\n\nIt was the debate that would end Biden’s political career. \n\n‘We sat around the table,’ Klain told Whipple for his forthcoming book. ‘[Biden] had answers on cards, and he was just extremely exhausted. And I was struck by how out of touch with American politics he was. He was just very, very focused on his interactions with NATO leaders.’\n\n‘He just became very enraptured with being the head of NATO,’ Klain said. \n\nWhipple writes that Klain ‘wondered half-seriously if Biden thought he was president of NATO instead of the US.’\n\nWhipple’s book Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History, will be published next week. The Guardian published excerpts.\n\nAnd, after that debate with Trump, Biden needed fluorescent tape to guide him through a fundraiser at New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy’s (D) house so he wouldn’t get lost.\n\nWhile politicians, like actors, have tape marks on the floor so they properly positioned to be on camera, Biden needed the trail of bright markings to serve as ‘colorful bread crumbs [that] showed the leader of the free world where to walk.’\n\n‘He knows to look for that,’ an aide explained, according to authors Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes for their book Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House, which is out this week.\n\nParnes told ‘Rising The Hill’ that Biden, at the fundraiser, had ‘fluorescent tape on the floor to guide him where he needs to go.’\n\n‘On foreign trips, there’s a makeup artist who comes in first thing in the morning to kind of liven him up and do his makeup ahead of these meetings. He wasn’t doing television. He was going into meetings,’ she said.\n\nDuring that fundraiser, Biden needed a teleprompter to speak to a small group of people on the patio and, even with the help of it, he still rambled and went off topic.\n\nThere are likely more damaging details to come.\n\nOriginal Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, comes out May 20th.\n\nThompson was one of the few reporters revealing concerns about Biden’s health during his presidency. \n\nBiden tripped and stumbled several times during his presidency. He admitted to having trouble walking after he fractured his foot during the 2020 presidential campaign and didn’t wear his boot like he was supposed to. He also made multiple verbal gaffes that messed up his administration’s messaging.\n\nAnd, finally, Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager and Isaac Arnsdorf have their book – 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America – coming out on July 8. \n\nBiden himself did not give any interviews to any of the authors of these books. \n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, Biden was battling questions about his physical and mental health. Trump repeatedly called him ‘Sleepy Joe’ and cast doubt on Biden’s cognitive abilities. \n\nThe White House continually pushed back, arguing the president was in great shape. \n\nBut the June 27th debate in Atlanta rapidly changed public perception of Biden. During the showdown, Biden often stared blankly into space, struggled for answers, and appeared shaky.\n\nIn the aftermath, Biden aides said he had a cold, which resulted in a ‘bad night.’ Some complained he was over-coached and over-practiced instead of being given time to recover from his illness. \n\nKlain was one of three aides who spent the most time with the Biden getting him ready for the debate. He’s known Biden for years and was also his chief of staff when Biden was vice president. Longtime aides Mike Donilon and Bruce Reed were the other two.\n\nThe trio, along with the president, arrived at Camp David the Saturday ahead of the debate to spend the next five days in preparation lockdown.\n\nBiden was just coming off a major jaunt of travel: he had been in France for a state visit and the anniversary of D-Day at Normandy, he went back to the United States, then he flew to Italy a few days later for a G7 meeting, and capped that off with a trip to the West Coast for campaign fundraisers.\n\nHe was exhausted and barely had time to rest. \n\nIn the privacy of Camp David, a presidential retreat in the mountains of Maryland, he was put through policy discussions and mock debate sessions to get him ready.\n\nBut Biden, who was battling a cold, left debate prep and fell asleep by the pool, Klain told Whipple.\n\nHe also seemed rattled and befuddled. \n\nThe then president ‘didn’t know what Trump had been saying and couldn’t grasp what the back and forth was,’ ‘didn’t really understand what his argument was on inflation’ and ‘had nothing to say about a second term other than finish the job,’ Whipple wrote.\n\nBiden was also obsessed about foreign leaders, saying ‘these guys say I’m doing a great job as president so I must be a great president.’\n\nThe first mock debate was scheduled to last 90 minutes but Klain ended after 45 as ‘the president’s voice was shot and so was his grasp of the subject,’ Whipple wrote. \n\nAnd 25 minutes into the second mock debate, Biden was done.\n\n‘I’m just too tired to continue and I’m afraid of losing my voice here and I feel bad,’ he said, according to the book. ‘I just need some sleep. I’ll be fine tomorrow.’ \n\nHe went off to bed.\n\n‘The president was fatigued, befuddled, and disengaged,’ Whipple writes. ‘Klain feared the debate with Trump would be a nationally televised disaster.’\n\nIndeed it was. \n\nIn the aftermath, it set off a series of questions about the viability of Biden’s candidacy and his ability to do the job. \n\nPublicly Biden’s family, friends and aides defended.\n\nPrivately they had concerns.\n\n‘Publicly, Democrats scoffed at Republican claims that Biden wasn’t up to the job,’ the Parnes and Allen write in their book. ‘But privately, some of them worried all along that they were putting too much stock in an old man who, at best, had long since lost his fastball.’\n\nOne friend of Biden and Obama’s told the authors the choice for Biden to seek reelection was the “original sin” of the 2024 election. The person blamed Biden’s family and close aides for not advising him to forgo a reelection bid.\n\nWhipple told Politico he thought Biden aides saw wanted they wanted to see.\n\n‘I happen to think that to call it a ‘cover-up’ is simplistic. I think it was stranger and way more troubling than that. Biden’s inner circle, his closest advisers, many of them were in a fog of delusion and denial. They believed what they wanted to believe,’ the author said.\n\nDemocratic leaders, meanwhile, worried Biden would lose the White House and take down House and Senate candidates with him.\n\nSome went public, questioning Biden’s ability to remain the nominee. After growing calls for his departure, including behind-the-scenes work by Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi, Biden exited the race on July 21.\n\nBut Klain, despite his concerns about Biden, thought he should have stayed in the race. \n\nHe got a call from Jeff Zients, his successor as chief of staff, telling him of Biden’s decision to step down.\n\nHe told Whipple it was a ‘gut punch.’\n\nHe said he told Zients: ‘I think that’s a mistake. I think this was an avoidable tragedy.’\n\nKamala Harris became the party’s nominee and ultimately lost to Trump.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAides to Joe Biden are revealing their concerns about how he was &#8216;out&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Inside Scoop: Biden&#8217;s Team Shares How Fluorescent Tape Helped Him Navigate first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/inside-scoop-bidens-team-shares-how-fluorescent-tape-helped-him-navigate/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/rewrite-this-title-Aides-reveal-how-Biden-was-out-of.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 15:50:50","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.029},{"id":307362790,"title":"Are you suddenly following Second Lady Usha Vance on Instagram?

The Ryanair FR5579 flight bound for Alicante took off from the capital at around 7.30am on Thursday, April 3. However, the on-board incident meant they had to land at London Stansted Airport just before 9am, data on Flight Radar showed. Our sister title Edinburgh Live understands the reason for the diversion was an on-board medical incident involving a male passenger. Among the passengers were nurses who attended to him, but he required assistance from paramedics, who boarded the plane at Stansted. Other passengers said they were left waiting on the tarmac for a period of time before the plane resumed its journey to Alicante later on this morning, leaving Stansted just before 11am. Nicola Sinclair said: \"We have been on the tarmac since just after 9am. A gentleman took unwell. \"Nurses on board tended to him but we had to divert to Stansted for paramedics to board. He was taken off the plane to receive further medical assistance. \"As we were not a scheduled flight from Stansted, we got put to the back of the queue for refuelling. We are just heading out to the runway just now. It all happened a few rows behind us near the rear.\" A spokesperson for Ryanair told Edinburgh Live: \"This flight from Edinburgh to Alicante (3 Apr) diverted to London Stansted after a passenger became ill onboard. \"The crew called ahead for medical assistance to meet the aircraft upon landing at London Stansted Airport who treated the passenger. This flight continued to Alicante that same morning (3 Apr).” Edinburgh Airport hit the headlines last month after Donald Trump's private jet was spotted landing in the capital.

A 33-year-old man has since appeared in court charged in connection with the incident. However, it was later revealed he had travelled for a 'business meeting' with First Minister John Swinney, who he had previously criticised for endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.","summary":"The plane had left Edinburgh Airport, but was forced to divert to London Stansted after a 'medical incident' onboard.","url":"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/edinburgh-flight-passengers-left-tarmac-34989349","image":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/article34989525.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_Passengers-Boarding-Ryanair-Ai.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 15:09:46","author":"Cara Blackhall,Isla Storie","authors":["Cara Blackhall","Isla Storie"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.306},{"id":307317632,"title":"Democrats Gain Momentum in Numerous Special Elections, Offering a Glimmer of Optimism","text":"Democrats have spent the first months of Donald Trump’s second administration wandering the political wilderness — facing record-low popularity while competing factions battle over how exactly to take on the president.\n\nAnd yet, in special election after special election so far this year, Democrats are faring miles better against Republican opponents than they did last fall in Trump’s faceoff with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nIn 16 special state legislative and congressional elections held so far this year, Democrats have bettered their margin of victory or defeat compared to the 2024 Trump-Harris battle by an average of about 11.5 points, according to data collected by the political site The Downballot. The Democrat overperformed in 14 of those 16 contests, including flipping deep-red state Senate districts in Iowa and Pennsylvania.\n\nThose trends continued Tuesday. In Florida, though Republicans comfortably held on to two very pro-Trump House seats that were open after the president tapped their members to serve in his administration, Democrats improved on their margin of defeat in Florida’s 1st Congressional District by 22 points compared to Harris’ result there last fall, while improving by 16-points in Florida’s 6th Congressional District.\n\nAnd in the high-profile Wisconsin state Supreme Court race that earned the most national attention of any of the contests held so far this year, liberal-leaning candidate Susan Crawford defeated conservative-leaning candidate Brad Schimel by 10 points, just months after Trump beat Harris by roughly a point in the presidential battleground. More than 2.36 million voters turnout out in that race, only 300,000 or so fewer than did in the 2022 midterms — a strong showing for an off-year contest. \n\nThe election results have injected a jolt of confidence in Democrats who’ve had little to celebrate since Trump’s win in November and as he and Elon Musk, his billionaire ally overseeing the rapid restructuring of the federal government in the president’s image, aggressively pursue substantial cuts to federal programs and workforces.\n\n“I was cautious about overreacting to the first couple of specials that popped up, but [Tuesday] was a pretty clear sign that people have watched what Trump and Musk have done to our country in three short months” — and they’re “pissed,” said Brendan McPhillips, a former adviser to Harris’ campaign. “There hasn’t been a more clear example in my lifetime of billionaires out to intentionally screw over regular people.”\n\nBut special elections are difficult to use as a true gauge of voter sentiment on Trump. For several years now, Democrats have beaten expectations and outpaced Republicans in off-cycle contests, as their coalition is increasingly made up of high-engagement, high-propensity voters while Republicans have become the coalition of the less engaged. That dynamic has helped Republicans perform much more strongly in presidential years — with Trump on the ballot.\n\nThe GOP’s turnout dynamic, meanwhile, has Republicans still searching for answers on how to be more competitive when Trump is not on the ballot. And the president hinted that Democratic strength in the off-year contests played a big role in his decision to pull Rep. Elise Stefanik’s nomination to serve as his ambassador to the United Nations. Stefanik represents an upstate New York district that Trump carried by 21 points last year.\n\nA senior Republican operative, who requested anonymity to speak candidly on the election results, said that even in an unfavorable environment for Republicans — this person noted that higher income, higher education voters who’ve drifted away from the GOP coalition in recent years are more likely to vote in off-year elections — Schimel performed several points worse than he should have in Wisconsin on Tuesday. And that should throw up some red flags for Republicans, especially as polling shows increased voter concerns around Trump’s handling of the economy.\n\n“Donald Trump’s image rating is still pretty good,” this person said. “But Donald Trump’s image rating relative to where it was on Election Day in 2024 is off, and it’s the first time in his history that he’s been upside down on the economy. I think that matters, and I think there’s a lot of uncertainty around his policies, and voters are concerned about it.”\n\nTrump advisers said they were not concerned by Tuesday’s results. But prominent Trump allies did not seek to sugarcoat the recent performances after Schimel’s defeat. Charlie Kirk, the right-wing activist and media personality, called on Trump boosters to “realize and appreciate that we are the LOW PROP party now.”\n\n“The party has been remade,” Kirk tweeted. “Special elections and off-cycle elections will continue to be a problem without a change of strategy. … Let Wisconsin be a wakeup call. Let it be a call to return to the frontlines. We won in November, but to save the Republican [sic] we must string together multiple victories and that starts in 2026.”\n\nVice President JD Vance, meanwhile, said the results highlighted what’s become a persistent issue for the right.\n\n“The political problem on the Republican side of the aisle is how to get our base to vote in off-cycle elections,” he tweeted. “We’ve seen the establishment (finally) accept Donald Trump’s leadership of the Republican Party. Now it’s time to try to actually learn from his political success.”\n\nYet, much of the focus of these early special elections, as well as in the Wisconsin judicial race, has actually been on Musk, not Trump. It’s a dynamic Musk himself has invited by getting intimately involved in the elections, whether promoting candidates online or spending money to boost them amid his stint as a central figure in Trump’s administration.\n\nDemocrats also made Musk a central target of their messaging at a time when his favorability ratings are considerably lower than Trump’s. An NBC News poll last month found that 39% of voters hold favorable views of the tech tycoon while 51% view him negatively.\n\nMusk held a campaign event in Wisconsin days before the election and even handed over million-dollar checks to voters. At the same time, his political group, America PAC, sought to turn out voters on Schimel’s behalf. A person familiar with Musk’s effort said the defeat won’t deter Musk from being involved in the midterms, adding that his political operation knew it was fighting an uphill battle in the race.\n\nBut others on the right said that while Musk was not a determinative factor in this race or others, they did not see his involvement as a net benefit.\n\n“Elon is a terrible surrogate and doesn’t get voters out the polls,” a senior Senate GOP aide said, adding they believed the Wisconsin contest was winnable. “The giving-out-checks gimmick doesn’t seem very effective. His political operation is pretty good apparently but having him front and center just activates Dems.”\n\nAdditionally, the senior Republican operative said it was “probably a mistake” for Musk to tie himself so closely to the election.\n\n“It probably did matter, because he’s less popular than the president, and he’s universally known,” this person said, adding, “You could see it in the polling.”\n\nYet, the senior Senate GOP aide said that while Republicans still need to figure out how to get their voters engaged without Trump on the ballot ahead of next year’s midterm elections, they see Democrats making a mistake by zooming in too much on Musk.\n\n“Dems also continue to have a weird issue where they somehow can’t attack Trump directly,” this person said, noting last year’s focus on Project 2025 and the more recent attacks aimed at Musk. “Going after Elon works when he inserts himself into the race proactively but it seems like they’re going to make the mistake of running against Elon now instead of Trump. It might actually even be genius from Trump to let Elon take all the arrows and then just drop him when it starts hurting his own numbers.”\n\nStella Sexton — co-campaign manager for Democrat James Malone, who won an upset victory over Republican Josh Parsons for a Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, state Senate seat — said she felt Musk ended up boosting Malone’s bid. In the closing days of the race, Musk promoted a tweet warning that Republicans could lose the seat. After Malone won, Musk wrote: “Damn.”\n\n“The support from Elon Musk probably ultimately helped us, because it got more eyes on the race,” Sexton said. “And obviously Elon Musk is very unpopular right now.”\n\nSexton said their strategy focused on turning out Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who were looking for a way to register their frustration with the government right now. Malone’s bid gave them that avenue. They saw Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s narrow victory in this state Senate district in his 2022 gubernatorial run as a model — and Malone ended up running slightly ahead of Shapiro.\n\n“We did not nationalize the race, except to say that you have a chance to vote for a Democrat, and by doing that, you’re going to send a message,” she said, adding, “And people were very enthusiastic about that.”\n\nIn an interview, Malone said he was focused on the local angle of his bid and listening to the concerns of voters as he went door to door. With his victory, he became the first Democrat to win a state Senate seat in Lancaster County since the 19th century. Trump carried his district by 16 points in November.\n\n“It was much more about local power,” Malone said. “Lancastrian citizens wanted to be heard, and they felt like I was giving them that chance.”\n\nMalone and his campaign took inspiration from Mike Zimmer, a Democrat who flipped a state Senate district in Iowa in January when he defeated his Republican opponent by 4 points. Trump carried Zimmer’s district by 25 points in November.\n\nZimmer told NBC News he was “exhausted” after Iowa Democrats “got our butts handed to us” in November, adding it was “a long conversation” with his family about whether to even run in the first place. He expected an onslaught of Republican attacks if he did, particularly related to transgender issues. That never materialized.\n\n“I think they just got cocky, and they thought that they could run anybody that they wanted with an R by their name, and they were going to win,” he said, adding he was personally unaware by just how many points Trump had just won the district by. “I really was a little taken aback, going, ‘Oh, wow, that was a 25-point swing.’”\n\nJack Doyle, a Democratic operative who’s worked on races in Pennsylvania, said that even though Democrats have done well in special elections in recent years, he feels the recent results offer “proof that the backlash against Trump is starting much earlier than a usual presidential term.”\n\nAnd as Trump spent Wednesday announcing sweeping and steep global tariffs — fulfilling a key campaign pledge on trade but risking a spike in prices in the process — Doyle said there’s further risk for Republicans.\n\n“He’s not acting as president along the same lines as he ran his race,” he said. “He isn’t trying to sell his inflation-reducing agenda and having trouble breaking through. He’s literally saying he doesn’t care about rising costs and [is] leaning into Musk cutting services.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDemocrats have spent the first months of Donald Trump’s second administration wandering&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Democrats Gain Momentum in Numerous Special Elections, Offering a Glimmer of Optimism first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/democrats-gain-momentum-in-numerous-special-elections-offering-a-glimmer-of-optimism/","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit_1500w/rockcms/2025-04/250402-Susan-Crawford-aa-1108-1c5f34.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 14:47:13","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.03},{"id":307328150,"title":"Democrats' 'gigantic conspiracy' to hide Biden's decline 'should make us angry,' says Karl Rove","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nAmericas Newsroom April 03, 2025 04:37 \n\n Democrats' 'gigantic conspiracy' to hide Biden's decline 'should make us angry,' says Karl Rove \n Fox News contributor Karl Rove joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss reports that former President Obama worked against Kamala Harris' 2024 nomination behind the scenes and the efforts to conceal former President Biden's mental decline. \n Tags POLITICSBARACK OBAMAJOE BIDENKAMALA HARRISELECTIONSPRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIESSHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRAMERICA'S NEWSROOM","summary":"Fox News contributor Karl Rove joins &apos;America&apos;s Newsroom&apos; to discuss reports that former President Obama worked against Kamala Harris&apos; 2024 nomination behind the scenes and the efforts to conceal former President Biden&apos;s mental decline.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6370978775112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/325293ee-71a9-4137-85cc-3441726a8c62/5cfc1ed9-b844-4f6b-b295-a9a6eccb3c0d/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 14:46:51","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":307319016,"title":"Tim Walz Embarrasses Himself With Stupid Comment About Elon Musk: WATCH","text":"Tim Walz continues to make a fool out of himself whenever he opens his mouth.

Rep. John Joyce, R-Pa., vice chairman of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, introduced a resolution of disapproval on Wednesday night targeting a Biden administration-era waiver granted to California that would help the state realize its goal of a full ban on the sale of new gas cars by 2035. It's backed by committee Chairman Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., who called the Biden administration waiver a \"de facto EV mandate\" for the Golden State. KAMALA HARRIS REVEALS TIMETABLE FOR MAKING MAJOR POLITICAL DECISION IN DEEP BLUE STATE \"The American people should choose what vehicle is right for them, not California bureaucrats. Congressman Joyce’s resolution would block a disastrous ban on the gas-powered vehicles that millions of Americans rely on each and every day,\" Guthrie told Fox News Digital. \"The Energy and Commerce Committee has been committed to addressing this issue since California first attempted to create a de facto EV mandate.\" Joyce said his resolution was \"long overdue.\" \"Since arriving in Washington, I have fought to protect consumer freedom and allow American families to choose the vehicle that best fits their budget and needs,\" Joyce said. A resolution of disapproval, under the Congressional Review Act, allows lawmakers a mechanism to oppose unilateral rules made by federal agencies. Biden's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved a waiver for California in December 2024, just over a month before he left office, that would make it possible for the state to phase out new gas-powered car sales by 2035. The waiver was granted despite concerns raised by major automakers earlier that year about the feasibility of California's goals – but state officials pushing the plan have insisted it's critical to take on climate change. At the time, the Biden administration argued the waiver amounted to an order rather than a regulatory rule, meaning it would not be subject to congressional review. But it's been the subject of a standoff between the Trump administration and the federal bureaucracy since then. The Trump administration asked Congress to review the waiver in late February of this year – paving the way for a potential repeal under the GOP-controlled House and Senate. But the Government Accountability Office (GAO) said last month that California's waiver is not subject to the Congressional Review Act.

They still haven’t learned their lesson | Norman Solomon","text":"Joe Biden’s insistence on running for re-election was certainly disastrous. It kept credible contenders out of the Democratic presidential primaries and prevented the selection of a nominee who had gained momentum in the winnowing process. Even after his stunningly feeble debate performance on 27 June last year, Biden took several weeks before finally opting out of the race. That left Kamala Harris a mere 107 days between the launch of her campaign and election day.\n\nAmple evidence shows that the Biden team was riddled with obstinate denial and misrepresentation aimed at the public. But tales of tragic egomania in high places can take us only so far. What’s essential is to scrutinize how – and why – the Democratic party, its leaders and its prominent supporters enabled Biden and his inner circle to get away with such momentous stonewalling for so long.\n\nDemocrats in Congress, with few exceptions, refused to jump off the Biden 2024 bandwagon until the debate disaster. Similar enabling also came from state party chairs and Democratic governors. Likewise, a wide range of party-allied organizations toed the Biden party line. Meanwhile, many activists took on the role of spectators, if not cheerleaders for another Biden campaign, in an unfolding tragedy of vast proportions.\n\nA common denominator was fear. Fear of being accused of disloyalty to the Democratic president. Fear of being ostracized by fellow Democrats or denounced by anti-Trump commentators. Fear of being accused of weakening the party by pointing out Biden’s evident frailty. Fear of damaging personal ambitions or future access to halls of power. And on and on.\n\nThe silence and compliance helped Biden to coast toward renomination. Yet by midway through his term, polling numbers and increasingly shaky public behavior were clear signals that he would be a weak candidate. Support from working-class voters, the young, and people of color drastically eroded.\n\nNotably, leading progressives in Congress assisted Biden in fending off a serious primary challenge. Representative Pramila Jayapal, then chair of the congressional Progressive caucus, made a very early endorsement. “I never thought I would say this, but I believe he should run for another term and finish this agenda we laid out,” she said in November 2022. Senator Bernie Sanders endorsed Biden in April 2023. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed him three months later.\n\nPolls routinely showed that most Democratic voters did not want Biden to run again. But party leaders were on autopilot, choosing discretion over valor, benefitting their relations with the White House but undermining the party’s prospects of retaining it – as is now painfully and undeniably clear.\n\nA few weeks ago, speaking at a Harvard Kennedy School forum, Jayapal said: “I do think had the president just served one term, he would have gone out a hero, he would have passed the torch, he would have been celebrated for his accomplishments, we would have had a really strong Democratic primary with a lot of good candidates, and then we would have had the full election season to fight it out and to actually get somebody who could win.”\n\nNow, an open question is whether crucial lessons have been learned and will be heeded. At stake is the capacity of the Democratic party to defeat Trumpist forces in the midterm elections next year and in 2028.\n\nThe outlook is not good. A grim reality is that the Democratic party and its loyalists have developed an enduring corrosive culture – which had everything to do with the insistence on continuing to fuel the faulty Biden 2024 locomotive as it dragged the party toward a calamitous defeat.\n\nI am not writing from a vantage point of hindsight alone. In November 2022, days after the midterm elections, my colleagues and I at the progressive non-profit RootsAction launched the Don’t Run Joe campaign (renamed Step Aside Joe when Biden announced his candidacy the following spring). During the next 20 months, not one other sizable national organization was willing to push for Biden to forego a re-election bid.\n\nWe began in New Hampshire, the longtime first-in-the-country presidential primary state. (Biden had finished fifth with only 8.4% of the vote in the 2020 Democratic primary there. For 2024, he demoted New Hampshire to make South Carolina first.) On 9 November 2022, our kickoff digital ads reached Democrats across New Hampshire. Within days, upwards of 2,000 Democratic voters in the state had signed a Don’t Run Joe petition, conveying this message: “We cannot risk losing in 2024. We shouldn’t gamble on Joe Biden’s low approval rating.”\n\nThat was the gist of our messaging that continued for more than a year and a half via online advertising, email blasts, social media, news releases, media interviews, mass texting to Democratic voters, leafleting at state party conventions and TV ads in several key states and Washington DC. A mobile Don’t Run Joe billboard circled the Capitol and White House as well as the site of a Democratic National Committee meeting.\n\nDon’t Run Joe placed full-page print advertisements in the Hill, aimed at congressional Democrats. One ad included a picture of men in suits with their heads in the sand. Presented as An Open Letter to Democrats in the House and Senate, the ad declared that “evasion is no solution” and concluded: “Conformity and fear of a White House rebuke have never served Democrats or the nation well. It is time to stop muffling genuine concerns and start being honest about the pivotal downsides of a prospective Biden ’24 candidacy. The future of the Democratic Party – and the country – is at stake.”\n\nToday, conformity and fear are still contagions afflicting the Democratic party, now impairing its capacity to roll back Donald Trump’s autocratic rule and effectively fight for a progressive agenda. The rebellion against Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, while encouraging, has not shaken the party’s underlying power structure. And habitual deference to uninspiring party leadership does not bode well.\n\nThe day after the president’s recent demagogic speech to Congress, the new Democratic National Committee chair, Ken Martin, and the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, were the featured speakers for “a virtual National Update and Call to Action”. The next morning, I received a text from a progressive Democratic party activist, who summarized the event as “sad and weak,” adding: “Jeffries and Martin’s delivery was anemic, content essentially pablum.” The activist signed off with the words “Really frightened”.\n\nI asked if it would be OK to use the activist’s name while quoting from the text in an article. The reply was both understandable and symptomatic of how fear prevents the kind of open debate that the Democratic party desperately needs: “No, I am working inside the party … ”\n\n Norman Solomon is the director of RootsAction and executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy.

It kept credible contenders out of the Democratic presidential primaries and prevented the selection of a nominee who had gained momentum in the winnowing process. Even after his stunningly feeble debate performance on 27 June last year, Biden took several weeks before finally opting out of the race. That left Kamala Harris a mere 107 days between the launch of her campaign and election day.\n\nAmple evidence shows that the Biden team was riddled with obstinate denial and misrepresentation aimed at the public. But tales of tragic egomania in high places can take us only so far. What’s essential is to scrutinize how – and why – the Democratic party, its leaders and its prominent supporters enabled Biden and his inner circle to get away with such momentous stonewalling for so long.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/04/democrats-biden-disaster","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a118a2c3fdf0c8e4f5aa2049cda430b62179b2d4/0_0_4488_2693/master/4488.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3Bpb","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 14:00:06","author":"Norman Solomon","authors":["Norman Solomon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.16},{"id":307422834,"title":"‘There’s an us v them mentality’: are young Australian men and women drifting apart politically?","text":"After Grace Richardson broke up with her long-term boyfriend, she entered a period she affectionately refers to as her “rat girl summer”.\n\n“I was using Hinge, I was going out, I was meeting people. I was 23, flirty and thriving,” the Sydney musician and podcast producer says.\n\nIt was during this season of self-discovery that Richardson met a man whose views, she says, “immediately set off alarm bells”.\n\nWhen Richardson mentioned her job, he revealed his favourite podcast was one that “gets feminists on and makes fun of them”.\n\nWhen she said she enjoyed going to the gym, he told her “men weren’t attracted to women with an athletic physique”.\n\n“From there the conversation descended,” Richardson says.\n\n Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter\n\nShe says her date told her women were “past their peak” after 24, that he did not “believe” in the gender pay gap and argued feminism had gone too far because women, in his view, now had “more rights than men”.\n\n“You hear about this stuff online but I had never expected to sit down with someone and have a conversation about it,” she says.\n\nHer experience may not be an isolated one. Research suggests there is a growing gender gap among gen Z voters, with election results around the world showing young men are shifting to the right while young women are becoming more progressive.\n\nAt the 2024 US election men aged between 18 and 29 turned out in force for Donald Trump, favouring him by 56% to 42%, while women of the same age voted for Kamala Harris by an even wider margin, 58% to 40%.\n\nYoung men at the 2024 UK election were twice as likely to vote for Nigel Farage’s rightwing populist party Reform UK (12% to 6%) while young women were more likely to vote Green than their male counterparts (23% to 12%).\n\nThis trend isn’t just a western phenomenon, according to Intifar Chowdhury, a lecturer in government at Flinders University.\n\n“In China, Taiwan and South Korea – particularly South Korea – the gulf between genders is quite wide and the young men are much more conservative than women,” Chowdhury says.\n\nSo what about Australia? Are we likely to see a similar pattern emerging at the federal election?\n\nGeneration gap widens\n\nDr Sarah Cameron is circumspect. A political scientist at Griffith University’s school of government and international relations and a chief investigator of the Australian Election Study, which has surveyed voters on their political attitudes and behaviours after each election since 1987, she says the gender gap in politics is “much smaller” than the generational gap.\n\nPolls tracked by Guardian Australia over the past year show Labor ahead 61.2% to 38.8% on a two-party-preferred basis among 18- to 34-year-olds, and marginally ahead among those aged 35 to 49, but significantly behind among older age groups.\n\n“Younger generations are much further to the left than previous generations were when they were at the same stage of life. That’s the biggest difference we are seeing among young people in Australia,” Cameron says.\n\n“Young women are a bit further left, in comparison to young men.”\n\nChowdhury agrees. She says long-term trends show men and women shifting leftwards – though young women are doing so more quickly.\n\n“There is a gender gap, in the sense that women are moving to the left at a quicker pace. But they aren’t moving in different directions,” she says.\n\nCameron attributes women’s shift left to their increasing participation in higher education and the workforce, as well as greater representation on the Labor benches in parliament. Chowdhury points to the #MeToo movement and the former Coalition government’s response to sexual assault allegations that followed.\n\nBoth Cameron and Chowdhury, however, note a substantial number of gen Zs will be voting for the first time in 2025, which could change existing assumptions.\n\nChowdhury points to a recent poll in the Australian Financial Review which found 37% of men aged 18 to 34 preferred Peter Dutton as prime minister, compared with 27% of women in the same age group. It also found 32% of women in the same age group would give their primary vote to the Greens (equal with Labor), compared with only 20% among men.\n\nAnthony Albanese has been actively courting young female voters, including by appearing on Abbie Chatfield’s It’s a Lot podcast and the Happy Hour podcast with Lucy Jackson and Nikki Westcott.\n\nFrustration with major parties\n\nDarien, 19, a music student at the University of Sydney, says he hangs out with “mostly progressive people” but there is a gap between his male and female friends, particularly when discussing social issues.\n\n“There is a divide between the genders – I’d like to think in my group there isn’t, but it’s there,” he says, citing the debate during the voice to parliament referendum as an example.\n\n“A lot of my female friends were voting yes and sharing posts about it – I know that they had issues with some of their male friends who weren’t.\n\n“There’s probably also a divide during conversations around things like reproductive rights.”\n\nDarien says most of his friends are more across US politics than Australian but he tends to avoid the topic because it’s “only going to create conflict”.\n\n“When it comes to Australian politics, people know less,” he says. “My friends tend to either really not like Peter Dutton or just don’t know who he is. I know that some of my friends don’t like Albo a whole lot. I personally think he’s doing an all right job.\n\n“But there’s this sort of us v them kind of mentality that’s developed, which makes it difficult for conversation around these topics to go anywhere.”\n\nChowdhury says it is important not to paint a picture of young men as a “looming reactionary force”, describing the discourse as “harmful” and “divisive”.\n\n“Many gen Z voters are going to vote for the first time and they’re voting during a cost-of-living crisis,” Chowdhury says.\n\nShe says young voters’ frustrations may stem more from economic challenges – such as stagnant wages, rising costs and dwindling opportunities – rather than “a feminism backlash”.\n\n“Economic concerns can really shape an election,” Chowdhury says. “People might be voting for the Coalition because of that, but we’re very quick to rush into making this conclusion that they’re moving to the right, so they must be conservative on all things.”\n\nHannah Ferguson, the founder of Cheek Media, a feminist platform aimed at educating young people about politics, says she sees a growing “anti-establishment streak” in young Australian men, who are frustrated with the “political system as a whole”.\n\n“The difference between us and the US is that a lot of young men are fed up with both parties, as opposed to the divide in America, which is based on that tribal red or blue, Democrats or Republicans,” Ferguson says.\n\n“I do think there will be a divide between how young men and women vote – on the whole, young men lean further right, but I think we’re not anywhere near the toxicity of the US.”\n\nShe also expects young people will turn to more independents and the Greens as a result.\n\nAs for Richardson, her date marked the end of rat girl summer.\n\n“I had a good run, and I met some nice guys, but this one just left a bad taste in my mouth,” she says.\n\nRichardson emphasises their conversation, which stretched four hours, was not heated or aggressive. She says she stayed because she wanted to understand his perspective and challenge it. But by the end, she realised his views were “entrenched”.\n\n“It made me take the blinkers off a bit,” Richardson says.\n\n“I felt disappointed, scared and misunderstood. It made me realise the hill is so much steeper than I thought it was.”","summary":"In recent elections overseas more young men than women have shifted to the right, even the far right.

Experts say it will take years to rekindle U.S. manufacturing, alter supply chains and bring home production, the goals Republican Trump and his supporters suggest his tariffs will achieve. In the meantime, consumers are likely to see higher prices, the economy could enter a downturn, and allies will put their own levies on American products - effects that Trump has called a disturbance but that voters may not be willing to accept going into the midterm elections next year. Trump's Republicans control the House of Representatives and the Senate with narrow margins. Tariff-driven losses in the midterms could hand power of one or both chambers to opposition Democrats.ALSO READ: Real reason why Trump's 'first buddy' Elon Musk is quitting DOGE in four months He (Trump) has a high tolerance for pain, but it could turn into real pain at the ballot box (in) November 2026, said Mike Dubke, a former communications director for the president during his first term. The concern here is what point are we going to see the benefits that he and his advisers believe we're going to reap? Because he's only got 18 months before the midterms. Economists say tariffs translate to taxes on consumers, and a broad majority of Americans - 70%, including 62% of Republicans - believe that increased tariffs will drive up the price of groceries and other consumer goods, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. About 53% of respondents to the poll agreed with the statement that increased tariffs would do more harm than good, while 31% disagreed. The rest were unsure or did not answer. Just 31% of respondents agreed that U.S. workers come out ahead when the country charges tariffs on imported goods, while 48% disagreed. The principal risk is around the economy, said Lanhee Chen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution and former adviser to Republican leaders Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio, referring to the tariffs. One is an immediate risk on prices and what that means for a president who was elected in part to bring prices down, he said. Another is the potential for the economy to enter a recessionary phase, said Chen, who cautioned that describing the potential economic impact was speculative and expressed support for the use of tariffs as a public policy tool. Trump promised as a presidential candidate to bring prices down, and voters' concerns about inflation hurt his 2024 opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee.ALSO READ: Barack Obama worked 'behind the scenes' to prevent Kamala Harris' nomination after Biden's shocking exit? On Wednesday, Trump said tariffs ranging from 34% on Chinese goods, in addition to a 20% levy that has already been imposed, to 20% tariffs on goods from the European Union, would enrich U.S. coffers. Now it's our turn to prosper, and in so doing use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt, and it will all happen very quickly, he said. Tariffs are paid by importers, not foreign countries, and they typically pass along the extra costs to consumers. On Thursday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick dismissed concerns about stock market volatility. Sure there's going to be some short-term movement but this is a reordering of global trade, he told CBS. In the long term, he said, you're going to see America thrive. Interest rates are going to come down, as we said, and America is going to thrive. ELECTORAL RISK Hints of dissatisfaction with Trump are beginning to show among Republicans. Republican candidates won two special elections in Florida on Tuesday by much slimmer margins than Trump won the state last year. In Wisconsin, an important political swing state that Trump carried, a liberal candidate won a seat on the state's Supreme Court in a repudiation of Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who had backed her conservative rival.ALSO READ: No romantic or sexual relationship with Chinese: Trump admin's diktat to employees in China amid tariff war The U.S. Senate on Wednesday passed legislation that would terminate new tariffs on Canada in a 51-48 vote that drew support from four Republicans.

A broad decrease in stock markets would hurt Americans' retirement savings 401k accounts. Liberation Day appears to be about liberating American businesses and consumers from their money, said one former Republican congressional aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. You can't stop an aircraft carrier on a dime and you can't completely reshape the global economy in a day. The White House, which blames inflation on former President Joe Biden, says the Trump administration is doing everything it can to bring down the cost of living and dismisses concerns about the political ramifications of his trade agenda. President Trump's first and only concern is the welfare of the American people. His historic trade action ... reflects his commitment to restoring American Greatness for our industries and workers - not to indulging mindless political hypotheticals, said White House spokesman Kush Desai. Biden, a Democrat, also sought to increase domestic manufacturing and production with three landmark laws that directed trillions of dollars toward rebuilding U.S. infrastructure and promoting investment in strategic sectors such as semiconductors, energy production and electric vehicles.ALSO READ: Trump's tariff plan keeps everyone guessing. Is it a recipe for economic disaster? Democrats are likely to pound Republicans over the economic impact of the tariffs. The healthy economy Trump inherited from Biden - growth came in at nearly 3% in 2024, with unemployment around 4% and inflation under 3% - is showing signs of fraying, although the hard data economists use to measure things such as gross domestic product and employment has shown little evidence of a near-term slowdown. Still, surveys measuring confidence in the economic outlook among households and businesses have turned uniformly downward in the last two months since Trump began his drum beat on tariffs, a stark reversal of the optimism that greeted his election in November. From a political risk standpoint, this is a really bad idea, said Philip Luck, director of the economics program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former deputy chief economist at the State Department under Biden, noting the chance of retaliation from U.S. trading partners. Barbara Trish, a political science professor at Grinnell College in Iowa, said Trump faced significant anxiety among voters, but in the past had always been able to escape deeper criticism. How many times have observers legitimately thought, OK, this is the last straw, the Teflon is going to take a hit, and it hasn't happened? she said. Small business owners gave mixed reviews. In Baltimore, a historically Democratic city, Drew Greenblatt, owner of Marlin Steel, said Trump's tariffs were already helping boost orders as customers shift to American-made products.

His unconfirmed departure is leading to questions about what will happen to the government agency when Musk is no longer involved and has also sparked speculations of a possible rift with President Trump. His exit was expected because of federal regulations limit special government employees (SGEs) to a maximum of 130 days in office. For Musk, that timeline means his last day at the department of government efficiency will be 30 May, exactly 130 days after Trump’s inauguration.ALSO READ: Barack Obama worked 'behind the scenes' to prevent Kamala Harris' nomination after Biden's shocking exit?Trump on Musk's exitOn Wednesday, Trump told the Cabinet and his inner circle that his billionaire ally and 'first buddy' Elon Musk will soon step back from his government role, Politico reported citing three people close to Trump. The report states both Trump and Musk decided in recent days that Musk will soon return to his businesses, but gave no specific date. Trump and Musk have both recently indicated that Musk would move on but have not said when. Based on a 130-day term, Musk's time as a special government employee would be set to end as soon as the end of May. He told Fox News last week that he was confident he would finish most of the work to cut $1 trillion in federal spending.“I think he’s amazing but I also think he’s got a big company to run and so at some point he’s going to be going back,” Trump was quoted as saying by Politico of the Tesla CEO. “He wants to. I’d keep him as long as I could keep him.”“I love very smart people, and he’s very smart, and he’s done a good job … I like high-IQ people. At some point, Elon’s going to want to go back to his company.”The Tesla CEO himself acknowledged the 130-day limit in an interview with Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier last week, saying, “I think we will have accomplished most of the work required to reduce the deficit by $1 trillion within that time frame.”ALSO READ: No romantic or sexual relationship with Chinese: Trump admin's diktat to employees in China amid tariff warIn addition, Musk told investors in early February that he expected to only be in the Trump White House for about four months, Post columnist Charles Gasparino reported at the time.Two months earlier, even before Trump took office, Musk had declared the “final step of DOGE is to delete itself.”Trump-Musk fractured ties?Elon Musk stepping down from DOGE has sparked rumours about tensions between the tech billionaire entrepreneur and the President. The news represents a shift in the Trump-Musk relationship from a month ago, when White House officials & allies were predicting Musk was ‘here to stay’ and that Trump would find a way to blow past the 130-day time limit,” Politico capitol bureau chief Rachel Bade breathlessly reported on X Wednesday morning, labeling her stating of the obvious a “SCOOP.”ALSO READ: Trump's tariff plan keeps everyone guessing.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt joined the dogpile of more than 1,200 commenters ridiculing Bade’s post. “This ‘scoop’ is garbage,” Leavitt responded to Blade’s thread before plainly restating the facts.Musk has made waves in his short time with the Trump administration, leading DOGE in making major cuts at the US Agency for International Development and the Department of Education, as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Social Security Administration.The massive layoffs sparked violent protests targeting Tesla vehicles — which prompted the Trump administration to crack down on vandals and call the attacks “domestic terrorism.”“I think a great wrong is being done to the people of Tesla and to our customers,” Musk told Baier. “I mean, Tesla’s a peaceful company that has made great cars, great products — that’s all it’s done.”Musk also made headlines earlier in the administration by directing all federal employees to send a progress report with five bullet points detailing their accomplishments in the previous week, but Trump later said DOGE would be serving more as “tech support” than human resources after yet another backlash.ALSO READ: 'Only my name was correct': Elon Musk's DOGE issues termination notices to USAID staff filled with errorsThe White House has also said Musk was using his tech knowledge to determine how Atlantic magazine editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was added to a confidential Trump administration Signal group chat on carrying out strikes against the Houthis in Yemen March 15.Why is Musk stepping down as DOGE chief?Elon Musk is what's known as a special government employee, a designation given to people who join the government for a short period of time typically to provide specialized expertise. The Congress in 1962 created the role of special government employee , which permits the executive branch, the legislative branch and independent federal agencies to bring on employees for specific roles on a temporary basis.SGEs are limited to working for the government for no more than 130 days out of a 365-day period, though they can work multiple years, and they can either be paid or unpaid. According to a report in NPR, Musk is not being paid for his work with DOGE.Special government employees must follow most of the same rules and guidelines as full-time employees, but with fewer restrictions in some areas, such as conflicts of interest, due to the temporary nature of their role. However, they are still prohibited from engaging in matters that could create financial conflicts of interest or impact a company they are affiliated with. Additionally, they are not allowed to use their position to influence an election while on duty.ALSO READ: 'We are scratching our heads': Trump imposes 29% tariff on tiny, remote Australian island with barely any exportsDonald Trump announced the creation of DOGE before he took office, and said Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy would lead it, though Ramaswamy left his role before the agency launched.

Here's what to expect","text":"Good morning. Here's what you need to know to start your day. What to know as Trump takes his tariffs global.Former federal health chief Xavier Becerra announces a run for California governor. The best places to eat and drink this month, according to our food writers.And here's today's e-newspaper.Trump announced Wednesday that the U.S. would begin applying a universal baseline tariff of 10% on imported goods from all foreign countries. That’s in addition to existing tariffs imposed on Mexico, Canada and China. Some nations will be slapped with higher rates, including the European Union and India. Trump called it “Liberation Day” as he accused nations around the world, both “friend and foe,” of having “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” the U.S. “This is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history,” Trump said during his announcement at the White House. “ It’s our declaration of economic independence.” Canada and Mexico look to have escaped country-specific tariffs but are still contending with Trump’s earlier 25% tariff on many products. A few import taxes were imposed on the two major U.S. trade partners, though the broader tariffs have been delayed twice. But a pause on them expired Wednesday. “These tariffs will remain in effect until such a time as President Trump determines that the threat posed by the trade deficit and underlying nonreciprocal treatment is satisfied, resolved, or mitigated,” administration staff wrote on the White House website. The new tariffs won’t include imports of copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber or bullion, the site states. Also excluded: “energy and other certain minerals that are not available in the United States.” Several countries are expected to respond with their own tariffs against the U.S., which experts warn could turn Trump’s recent import skirmishes into a global trade war that could spiral into a recession. “While Trump acknowledged the tariffs are likely to bring ‘a little disturbance’ to the markets, he has underscored that their purpose is to reignite the American economy,” The Times’ Faith E. Pinho, Michael Wilner and Kate Linthicum reported Wednesday. “White House officials have repeated that tariffs will be lifted on companies that decide to move their manufacturing to the U.S.” What will this mean for our wallets? Trump has asserted multiple times that tariffs are paid by the foreign countries they’re imposed on. The reality is that importers — U.S.-based businesses — will be paying these tariffs. And to offset paying 25% to bring the products they aim to sell over the border, those businesses are expected to start charging customers more. Given that the U.S. imports the most foreign goods of any nation, it’s likely you regularly purchase food, beverages, clothing, electronics and an array of other products that are shipped here from other countries. After Trump’s new tariffs take effect, expect the cost of many of those items to start rising. Some businesses might not do that right away, experts say, but if the added cost of importing starts affecting bottom lines, consumers can expect to make up for that. That includes such everyday purchases as produce, toys and shoes but also major purchases including household appliances, new homes and, of course, new cars. The U.S. auto industry is largely a misnomer, as new cars and trucks are built along a complex continent-spanning assembly line where car parts cross between Mexico, Canada and the U.S. multiple times before rolling to a dealership. Now some Southern California car buyers are scrambling to avoid the looming price hikes, my colleagues Andrea Chang and Caroline Petrow-Cohen reported this week. “Tariff-related price hike estimates vary depending on the vehicle,\" they wrote, \"but most industry experts predict new cars will cost several thousand more.\" Dining out could also get more expensive. The National Restaurant Assn. is warning that the tariffs will hit restaurants hard and have requested that food and beverages be exempt. \"Applying new tariffs at this scale will create change and disruption that restaurant operators will have to navigate to keep their restaurants open,” the trade group’s president and chief executive, Michelle Korsmo, wrote in a statement. “The biggest concerns for restaurant operators — from community restaurants to national brands — are that tariffs will hike food and packaging costs and add uncertainty to managing availability, while pushing prices up for consumers.” It’s worth noting that the current trade deal among the three North American nations was signed by Trump in his first term. At that time, his administration trumpeted the agreement as “a tremendous victory for American workers, farmers, manufacturers, and businesses alike.” Here’s more of our news coverage and opinion pieces on the tariff tussle: Trump’s tariffs reshaped manufacturing in Asia.

Gavin Newsom said at his first inauguration, “and we will seize this moment.” Others see California as deserving and capable of nationhood, a topic that has resurfaced with Trump’s presidency as it reflects, as a New York Times column put it, “the shared values of our increasingly tolerant and pluralistic society.”\n\nCritics say this vision is at odds with the facts on the ground. Rather than the exemplar of a new “progressive capitalism” and a model for social justice, California both accommodates the highest number of billionaires and the highest cost-adjusted poverty rate. It has the third highest gap, behind just Washington, D.C., and Louisiana, between middle- and upper-middle-income earners of any state. Nearly one in five Californians – many working – lives in poverty (using a cost-of-living adjusted poverty rate); the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) estimates another one-fifth live in near-poverty – roughly 15 million people in total.\n\n“California” is a model that no longer delivers. To be sure, California has a huge GDP, paced largely by high real estate prices and the stock value of a handful of huge tech firms. It retains the inertia from its glory days, particularly in technology and entertainment, but that edge is evaporating as tech firms flee the state and Hollywood productions are shot around the world. For all its strengths, California has the nation’s second-highest rate of unemployment with lagging job growth, particularly in comparison to its neighbors and chief rivals, notably Texas, Arizona, and Nevada. \n\nThe signs of failure are evident on the streets. Roughly half the nation’s homeless population lives in the Golden State, many concentrated in disease- and crime-ridden tent cities in Los Angeles or San Francisco. Barely one in three state residents – and only one in four younger voters – now considers California a good place to achieve the American dream. Increasingly, California is where this dream goes to die.\n\n‘San Francisco Gentry Liberalism’\n\nThe roots of California are long and deep. In August, for example, the New York Times reported how its development into a one-party state controlled by progressive Democrats has made it the country’s center of political corruption. “Over the last 10 years,” the Times reported, “576 public officials in California have been convicted on federal corruption charges, according to Justice Department reports, exceeding the number of cases in states better known for public corruption, including New York, New Jersey and Illinois.”\n\nIronically, the state’s corruption and decline have been expressed through policies long touted as symbols of progressive enlightenment and virtue – the odd marriage of oligarchal wealth and woke political consciousness some describe as “San Francisco gentry liberalism.” \n\nUnder this regime, epitomized by Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris, progressivism has lost its historic embrace of upward mobility and replaced it with an ideology obsessed with race, gender, and climate. It has produced a political leadership class that, for the most part, is largely made up of long-time government or union operatives. In the legislature, the vast majority of Democrats have little to no experience in the private sector. The failure may have been accelerated by the secular decline of the once-powerful Republican Party over the past two decades. This decline removed the incentives for Democrats to concern themselves with moderate voters of either party. \n\nThis development represents a distinct break even with California’s pro-growth progressive past, which helped make the Golden State a symbol of American opportunity, innovation, and prosperity. The late historian and one-time state librarian Kevin Starr observed that, under the governorship of Democrat Pat Brown in the late fifties and early sixties, California enjoyed “a golden age of consensus and achievement, a founding era in which California fashioned and celebrated itself as an emergent nation-state.” In 1971, the economist John Kenneth Galbraith described the state government as run by “a proud, competent civil service,” enjoying some of “the best school systems in the country.”\n\nThis may seem something like ancient mythology to most Californians today. If the builder Pat Brown was an exemplar of “Responsible Liberalism,” California’s government today has been ranked by Wallet Hub as the least efficient in delivering services relative to the tax burden. Pat Brown’s son Jerry – who was governor from 1975-1983 and then again from 2011-2019 – and his successor, Newsom, epitomize the triumph of ideology over effectiveness. Theirs is a kind of performative progressivism that shrugs about things like roads that are now among the nation’s worst, a high-speed bullet train plagued with endless delays and massive cost overruns, and a failure to boost critical water systems in a perennially drought-threatened state. \n\nIn exchange for all this, the progressive regime has stuck ordinary Californians and businesses with some of the nation’s highest taxes and greatest regulatory burdens. California’s business climate is rated at or near the bottom in most business surveys. The Tax Foundation’s 2019 State Business Tax Climate Index, which evaluates taxes in five categories, also lists California at number 49, with only New Jersey trailing.\n\nThese policies have made California exceptionally expensive for both businesses and households. Indeed, according to current estimates, only Hawaii and Massachusetts have a higher cost of living. California has the highest average housing, second highest transportation, and third highest food expenses in the country. Much of this is invisible to the top 20% and 5% of California households, who enjoy median incomes of $72,500 and $129,000 greater than their national counterparts, but is widely felt in the state’s less affluent areas. \n\nPell-Mell Into Climatism\n\nCalifornia progressivism today embraces many causes – undocumented immigrants, transgender kids, reparations for slavery – but nothing has shaped the state’s contemporary politics more in recent years than a commitment to what Newsom described in 2018 as “climate leadership.” \n\nIn embracing the catastrophism that defines climate change as an existential threat to life on the planet, Newsom has left behind the old progressive notion of focusing on materially improving people’s lives by embracing inherently uncertain computer models predicting danger. \n\nIn California, experts from what Bjorn Lomborg, a leading skeptic of climate catastrophism, calls “the climate industrial complex” provide the justification for staggeringly expensive, socially regressive mandates based on the conjured models; the state mandates GHG reductions but leaves implementation in the hands of state agencies closely aligned with the green lobby.\n\nThis allows the legislature to look the other way as state climate policies knowingly increase poor and working family costs and shift billions of dollars to the wealthy in the relentless pursuit of unilaterally modeled carbon emission targets that even advocates admit cannot possibly “fix” the global climate. Indeed, in 2023, the California Air Resources Board belatedly disclosed current state climate policies would disproportionately harm households earning less than $100,000 per year while boosting incomes for those above this threshold. \n\nNewsom’s dogged emphasis on climate change – and achieving “carbon neutrality” by 2045 – has meant massive subsidies for wind and solar, mandates to reduce personal car use by nearly three times the temporary cuts caused by pandemic lockdowns, electrification of home appliances at a cost of many thousands of dollars per household, and even cuts to dairy and livestock emissions with technology mandates, accelerating the relocation of these food producers to other states and increasing food prices. \n\nTo justify the pain, state regulators estimated that paying for these changes today would prevent future climate damage, all of which depend on highly uncertain projections spanning, in some cases, hundreds of years in the future. The problem is that even if damage projections are remotely accurate, California’s climate law recognizes that the state cannot affect the global climate unless everyone else in the world follows suit. In fact, global emissions are rising, especially from China, which exported over $120 billion in goods and services, notably manufactured goods, often produced with coal, to California in 2023. \n\nAlso based on “expert” opinion, the state has embraced a policy to force people to buy electric vehicles by 2035, a policy increasingly questionable amidst slowing demand for these vehicles. Once again, state officials relying on speculative projections proclaim that the policy will benefit the state’s consumers and the environment, although this seems questionable, given, as Volvo suggests, the energy demands of building such cars may take years to have a positive impact.\n\nFires: The Price of Climate Delusion\n\nThe recent fires that incinerated a swath of Los Angeles revealed the shortcomings of the current climate-obsessed regime. To be sure, President Trump’s claim that water policies created the conflagration is largely false, but the lack of attention to water delivery and forest maintenance, a consistent aspect of the Jerry Brown-Newsom era, clearly contributed to the intensity of the blaze. \n\nIn 2014, California voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure allocating $2.7 billion to increase state water storage capacity, including the building of new reservoirs. These facilities would not only improve an aging water system neglected for decades but also capture and store precipitation that may occur in less frequent, more intense storms. Yet, even government apologists concede that, 10 years later, progress has been too slow, with deeply entrenched bureaucracies issuing permits only at a “glacial” pace. \n\nRather than building on the achievements of Pat Brown, state officials spent a quarter of a billion dollars helping environmental groups destroy dams and hydroelectric generation along the Klamath River in northern California. While this effort may yet improve fish habitat as intended, its initial results are sobering. Most of the river’s existing fish, crustaceans, and other organisms were killed by toxic sediment as the dams were removed, and unanticipated tar-pit-like mud exposure trapped large mammals, including protected wild horses. In March 2024, fish that state biologists confidently released into the restored river perished in a mass “die-off” within two days.\n\nThese misplaced priorities are also mirrored in Los Angeles, where reservoirs were left empty, leaving water unavailable and water hydrants without pressure. Both the state and local governments have failed to sufficiently fund fire-fighting operations, except for approving lavish pensions. \n\nThe climate catastrophists may promote fires as a sign of the coming apocalypse, but still consistently oppose effective fire management, as the Little Hoover Commission found as far back as 2018, discouraging such things as controlled burns and brush clearance. Policies of controlled burns, practiced by Native Americans and in areas like Western Australia, have been largely ignored. \n\nEven as he rails against “misinformation,” Newsom blamed the recent LA fires, as he has earlier blazes, on climate change. This claim has been widely debunked by scientists like Steve Koonin and Roger Pielke and the U.S. Geological Service. Undaunted, Newsom’s neat solution appears to be to sue the oil companies for fires made far worse by Newsom’s own policies. \n\nThe Greening of Decline\n\nCharred landscapes and burnt houses reflect one legacy of California’s progressive obsessions. More widespread has been the impact of taxes and climate regulations on the overall economy, particularly for minorities and working- and middle-class households, who were once the focus of traditional liberalism.\n\nThis shift has been bolstered by the ascendancy of public employee unions and the remarkable growth of the state bureaucracy. California, under Pat Brown, largely avoided public employee unions, but his son Jerry and other governors reversed this policy. Since 2022, even with budget shortfalls, California has among the highest rate of government sector growth in the country. Today, they are widely seen as a dominant force in Sacramento. Particularly powerful has been the 310,000-member California Teachers Association. Their numbers have continued to swell, even amidst budget shortfalls, at a faster rate than private-sector employment. \n\nPublic employees, or their union representatives, constitute a powerful part of California’s emerging class hierarchy. Increasingly, their livelihoods are tied to an agenda of ever more regulation and taxes. Public workers, of course, also share these costs, but more regulation also engenders more jobs for the bureaucracy.\n\nUnfortunately, the vast majority of Californians, particularly the working class, do not enjoy such benefits. In assessing the impacts of climate policies, environmental and civil rights attorney Jennifer Hernandez has dubbed these policies “the Green Jim Crow,” linking the state’s climate regulatory effort to the impoverishment of millions. California has the highest energy prices in the continental U.S., double the national average, which has exacerbated “energy poverty,” particularly among the poor and those in the less temperate interior.\n\nIn 2023, Chapman University researcher Bheki Mahalo found that the tech and information sector accounted for close to two-thirds of state GDP, compared to 8.5% in 1985. Virtually every sector associated with blue-collar employment – manufacturing, construction, transportation, and agriculture – has declined while most others have stagnated. \n\nConsider California’s once vibrant fossil fuel industry. The state’s last major oil firm, Chevron, recently moved to Houston. In 1996, California imported less than 10% of its crude oil from foreign sources. In 2023, foreign suppliers such as Iraq and Saudi Arabia accounted for over 60% of the state’s supplies. This continued shuttering of the state’s fossil fuel industry will cost California as many as 300,000 generally high-paying jobs, roughly half held by minorities, and will devastate, in particular, the San Joaquin Valley, where 40,000 jobs depend on the oil industry. \n\nOther blue-collar industries – construction, manufacturing, logistics, and agriculture – are also suffering under California’s climate policies. Over the past decade, it has fallen into the bottom half of states in manufacturing sector employment, ranking 44th in 2023; its industrial new job creation has paled in comparison to gains from competitors such as Nevada, Kentucky, Michigan, and Florida. Even without adjusting for costs, no California metro area ranks in the U.S. top 10 in terms of well-paying, blue-collar jobs. But four – Ventura, Los Angeles, San Jose, and San Diego – sit among the bottom ten. \n\nBut not all the damage has been limited to “the carbon economy.” Progressive climate, labor, and tax policies have chased a broad range of companies out of the state, including an array of leading companies tied to professional services and engineering: Jacobs Engineering, Parsons, Bechtel, Toyota, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Charles Schwab, and McKesson. Even Hollywood is hemorrhaging jobs, and recently, In and Out Burger, the state’s widely beloved fast food chain, announced it is planning a move to Tennessee. California is increasingly losing ground both in tech and high-end business services to sprawling, low-density metro areas like Austin, Nashville, Orlando, Charlotte, Salt Lake City, and Raleigh. \n\nCalifornia, once the land of opportunity, is the single worst state in the nation when it comes to creating jobs that pay above average, while it is at the top of the heap in creating below-average and low-paying jobs. The state hemorrhaged 1.6 million above-average-paying jobs in the past decade, more than twice as many as any other state. Since 2008, the state has created five times as many low-wage jobs as high-wage jobs. In the past three years, the situation worsened, with 78.1% of all jobs added in California from lower-than-average paying industries versus 61% for the nation as a whole.\n\nThe only sector that has seen a big growth in higher-wage jobs has been the government, which is funded by tax receipts from the struggling private sector. Public sector employment is growing at about the same pace as jobs overall in California, but over the decade at twice the national pace. The average annual pay for those public sector government jobs is now almost double that of private sector jobs. \n\nThe Housing Crisis: Middle-Class Kill Shot\n\nThe lack of well-paying jobs meshes poorly with high living costs, notably in terms of housing. Here again, climate politics play a critical role in driving high housing prices in California. In the late 1960s, the value of the typical California home was more than four times the average household’s income. Today, it’s worth more than 11 times. The median California home is priced nearly 2.5 times higher than the median national home, according to 2022 Census data.\n\nA key driver of this price hike is climate policy restraints on suburban development and single-family housing, supposedly to cut residential emissions. These restrictions push putting new housing close to transit in a state where barely 3% of employees use it to get to work, according to the American Community Survey. Perhaps more to the point, these policies are not what most Californians want. One recent PPIC survey has found that 70% of Californians prefer single-family residences, according to a poll by former Obama campaign pollster David Binder, and oppose legislation, written by Democratic Senator Scott Wiener, that banned single-family zoning in much of the state. \n\nThe state has tried to sell its density dream as a means to boost production as well as lower prices. It has not worked out. From 2010 to 2023, California’s housing stock rose by just 7.9% over this period, lower than the national increase (10.3%), and well below housing growth in Arizona (13.8%), Nevada (14.7%), Texas (24%), and Florida (16.2%). These states are also the primary beneficiaries of California’s outmigration. An unusually large pool of affluent households is “stuck” and bids up prices in urban rental markets.\n\nToday, homeownership is becoming rarer among California residents. The state now has the nation’s second lowest homeownership rate, at 55.9%, slightly above New York (55.4%). High prices impact young people, particularly on the homeownership rate. \n\nHomeownership for Californians under 35 has fallen by more than half since 1980 and is plummeting even among people in their 40s and 50s. Minorities are particularly impacted by these initiatives. Based on census data analyzed by demographer Wendell Cox, the state’s African American homeownership rate is 35.5% – well below the national rate of 44% – and the state’s Latino homeownership rate ranked 41st nationwide. \n\nFrom Surfboard to Walker? \n\nIf you think of California’s wealth-creation machine as a conveyor belt, continually providing generations with a stake in society through their homes, that belt has now stalled. Reduced economic opportunity and lack of affordable housing have created something once thought impossible – population growth well below the national average. In virtually every survey exploring why residents are leaving the state, housing costs are at the top of the list.\n\nIncreasingly, California’s demographics resemble the pattern of out-migration long associated with northeastern and midwestern states. Since 2000, more than 4 million net domestic migrants, a population about the same as the Seattle metropolitan area, have moved to other parts of the nation from California. Since 2020, the pace has picked up, with almost 1. 5 million domestic migrants in just four years. \n\n Many leaving the state are in their 30s and 40s, precisely the group that tends to buy houses and start businesses. In 2022, California lost over 200,000 net migrants older than 25, the bulk of whom had either four-year or associate degrees. The groups showing the biggest tendency to leave, according to IRS numbers, are those in their late 30s to late 50s, which includes people who tend to have families. \n\nAt the same time, international migration, long a source of demographic vitality, has lagged behind other key states, notably Texas. As the Brookings Institution has noted, from 2010 to 2018, the foreign-born population of Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, Columbus, Charlotte, Nashville, and Orlando increased by more than 20%, while San Francisco’s foreign-born population grew only 11%, and New York’s grew by 5%. \n\nThe state retains by far the nation’s largest foreign-born population, but even the massive movement allowed under Biden’s open border policy since 2021 failed to reverse population declines in big California cities. With the border now effectively closed, this last source of population growth is likely to decline.\n\nBy losing immigrants and younger people, the state is effectively consuming its “seed corn.” The state’s total fertility rate, long above the national average, is now the nation’s 10th lowest and falling faster than the national average as well as among its key competitors. Los Angeles and San Francisco rank last and second-to-last in birthrates among the 53 major U.S. metropolitan areas. In California, only Riverside/San Bernardino exceeds the national average for births among women aged between 15 and 50, according to the American Community Survey.\n\nUltimately California, the birthplace of youth culture, is getting old, in some places more resembling Hawaii than the entrepreneurial powerhouse of the past. From 2010 to 2018, California aged 50% more rapidly than the rest of the country, according to the American Community Survey. As of 2022, 21%, or 8.3 million people, were over the age of 60 in California, and according to the California Department of Aging, this population is expected to grow by 40% in the next 10 years. By 2036, seniors will be a larger share of the population than kids under the age of 18. California is gradually ditching the surfboard and adopting the walker. \n\nNeeded: A New California Agenda\n\nGavin Newsom’s response to the state’s decline has been not to call for major reform but for “Trump proofing” the state, spending tens of millions on lawsuits. Such gestures do not address how California can maintain its status as the epicenter of “the new economy” and address the vast divides between the elite and highly educated, and the vast mass of our residents. \n\nRather than fight the president at every turn, California can find ways to take advantage of the new regime. After all, hanging on to the climate agenda is doing very little good for Californians or the planet. California has reduced its emissions since 2006 at roughly the same rate as the rest of the country. The fires have largely erased even these gains, as does the fact that when people or companies flee the state, their carbon signature tends to increase. \n\nOddly, Trump could force needed policy changes in order to bring in federal help, something Newsom has already done in regard to water policy. The notion that California has a better model – the rationale for the Newsom-led “resistance” – does not sell in the rest of the country, much less at the White House. In a national 2024 survey conducted for the Los Angeles Times, only 15% of respondents felt that California is a model other states should copy; 39% said the state was not a model and should not be emulated; 87% said the state was too expensive; and 77% would not consider moving to California. \n\nYet, for all its problems, California is far from hopeless, and its promise is not extinguished. It remains uniquely gifted in terms of climate, innovation, and entrepreneurial verve. Sitting at the juncture of Asia, Latin America, and North America, it can once again become, as Kevin Starr noted, America’s “final frontier: of geography and of expectation.”","summary":"California's economic, academic, media, and political establishment still embraces the notion of the state's inevitable supremacy.","url":"https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2025/04/03/climate_change_driving_californias_golden_road_to_decline_1101336.html","image":"https://assets.realclear.com/images/68/682636_6_.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 13:07:33","author":"Joel Kotkin,RCInvestigations","authors":["Joel Kotkin","RCInvestigations"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.316},{"id":307280556,"title":"Barack Obama worked 'behind the scenes' to prevent Kamala Harris' nomination after Biden's shocking exit?","text":"Former US President Barack Obama pushed hard to try to prevent Kamala Harris from being anointed the Democratic nominee in the 2024 race for president, a book has claimed.

He secured 312 electoral votes against his Democratic counterpart's 226. Trump also won the popular vote, receiving approximately 49.8 per cent compared to Harris's 48.3 per cent.","summary":"Barack Obama reportedly tried to block Kamala Harris' nomination for the post of President after Joe Biden's exit from the race, a book has claimed.

The majority of Americans believe that current US President Donald Trump should not be allowed to run for the nation’s highest office in 2028, according to a joint poll conducted by the British pollster YouGov and The Economist magazine.\n\nAs many as 68% of the survey’s participants oppose the idea of Trump seeking a third presidential term, and only 20% support it. Meanwhile, the majority of those polled (56%) are sure that the current US leader will try to run in the next election, with 28% of respondents thinking otherwise.\n\nAccording to the poll’s results, current US Vice President JD Vance and his Democratic predecessor Kamala Harris are seen as the main presidential contenders. A total of 69% of surveyed Republicans supported Vance’s candidacy. Next came Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (42%) and the current US president’s son, Donald Trump Jr. (39%). As for the Democratic camp, Harris (58%) was the top pick, followed by former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg (39%) and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz (38%).\n\nThe respondents largely don’t approve of the activities of the parties they support (37% among Republicans and 33% among Democrats). The shares of those who approve the two parties’ activities stand at 14% and 5% respectively. However, those polled believe that the GOP is more united than their opponents (53% compared to 23%).\n\nThe poll, which involved over 1,600 people across the US, was conducted between March 30 and April 1. The margin of error does not exceed 3.3 percentage points.\n\nTrump’s potential third term\n\nTrump earlier told NBC News that he was \"not joking\" about running for a third term, although the White House press pool reported later that he would like to refrain from discussing the issue for the time being.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution, adopted in 1951, says that \"no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\" NBC News clarified earlier that there were two ways to change the constitution in order to provide Trump with legal grounds to seek a third term. The first option would require a two-thirds majority vote in the congress. In the second scenario, two-thirds of US states (34 out of 50) could call a constitutional convention where amendments would be proposed. Both options also stipulate that 38 out of the 50 states would need to ratify the amendments. According to NBC News, given that Republicans have a clear majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, the convention option looks the most realistic.","summary":"The respondents largely don’t approve of the activities of the parties they support (37% among Republicans and 33% among Democrats)","url":"https://tass.com/world/1938443","image":"https://cdn-media.tass.ru/width/1200_4ce85301/tass/m2/en/uploads/i/20250403/1442145.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 12:54:51","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"RU","sentiment":-0.278},{"id":307283784,"title":"'Fight' author shares behind-the-scenes moments from 2024 race, Obama's warning","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nFox And Friends April 03, 2025 04:22 \n\n 'Fight' author shares behind-the-scenes moments from 2024 race, Obama's warning \n Jonathan Allen, co-author of 'Fight,' discusses key points from his new book detailing former President Obama's reported opposition to Kamala Harris' 2024 nomination and the awareness of former President Biden's decline.\n Tags POLITICSBARACK OBAMAKAMALA HARRISJOE BIDENELECTIONSPRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIESSHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRFOX & FRIENDS","summary":"Jonathan Allen, co-author of &apos;Fight,&apos;

Social media users are finding the video relevant in the wake of the president’s flurry new tariffs announced this Wednesday.\n\nDonald Trump sent shockwaves around the world when he followed every one of us through his tariff threats on his ‘what he calls Liberation Day.’ He imposed a 10% baseline tax on imports from every country and higher tariff rates on several nations. This also includes 34% tax on imports from China and 20% on the European Union. Global leaders say that the tariffs are a “major blow to the world economy,” and stock markets have plummeted.\n\nTrump claims that the import levies, which range from 10% to 49%, will do to US trading partners what they have long done to the US, bringing manufacturing and jobs back to the country. However, during her 2024 presidential campaign, Harris warned that they would cost American families $4,000 per year.\n\nIf only someone warned us that Trump would enact tariffs…\nOh wait! @KamalaHarris did over and over and over again. pic.twitter.com/LCmZuKLTB2\n— Shontel Brown (@ShontelMBrown) April 2, 2025\n\nA video compiling several clips of her warnings has been circulating on social media since Trump’s announcement. “If only someone warned us that Trump would enact tariffs…Oh wait! @KamalaHarris did over and over and over again,” an X user wrote alongside the footage.\n\nIn the first clip, Harris said: “Tariffs on all imports that he has described would be a 20% sales tax in essence on basic necessities for the average American worker, average American family totaling almost $4,000 a year – that is no small matter.”\n\nIn a second warning, Harris adds: “He wants to impose what is, in effect, a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities that we import from other countries, that will devastate Americans. It will mean higher prices on just about every one of your daily needs.”\n\nOn another occasion, the former vice president remarked: “Let’s be clear that the Trump administration resulted in a trade deficit, one of the highest we’ve ever seen in the history of America. He invited trade wars.”\n\nShe keeps explaining in a fourth clip: “Understand that part of his plan is to put in place a national sales tax of at least 20% on everyday goods and necessities and that by economists’ estimates, independent economists, would cost you as the American consumer and taxpayer an additional $4,000 a year.”\n\nThe footage concluded with Harris comparing her and Trump’s economic policies. “Mine will strengthen the economy, this will make it weaker,” she said.\n\nSupporters of Kamala Harris have been highlighting her warning and claiming she was “right about everything”. One person wrote: “Kamala Harris told y’all Donald Trump would impose tariffs on everyday goods and basic necessities that we import from other countries that would unfortunately cost the average family 4,000$ a year, and y’all took her as a joke.”\n\nWe’re about to find out how harmful his tariffs are for Americans.\nWhich yes VP Kamala Harris warned everyone about. pic.twitter.com/eSgEFLBW1h\n— sky (@skylikeajedi) March 4, 2025\n\nAnother posted: “When the tax increase aka tariffs hits your pocket just remember Kamala Harris was right about everything.” A third said: “This Liberation Day nonsense is why I voted for Kamala Harris. Her administration wouldn’t be setting a calendar day to purposely tank the economy because she didn’t understand the consequences of massive amounts of tariffs to pay for tax cuts to the wealthy.”\n\nHowever, Trump supporters praised his decision, citing reciprocal tariffs as one of his core campaign promises and a reason they voted for him. One said: “lol! He literally told everyone at every single one of his campaign rallies that he was going to enact tariffs!”\n\nAnother commented: “Trump warned us. He said it over and over. That is why we voted for him. Get over it.” Speaking of Harris, one Trump supporter claimed: “She just wanted to give everything away for free.”","summary":"Old clip of Kamala Harris warning Americans about Trump and tariffs have resurfaced, supporters claim 'she was right all along'","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/she-was-right-about-everything-the-internet-cant-get-over-kamala-harris-eerie-warning-about-trumps-tariffs","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kamala-Harris-Clip-Resurfaces-After-Trumps-Shocking-Tariff-Move.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 11:03:30","author":"Shrobana Rakshit","authors":["Shrobana Rakshit"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.07},{"id":307372876,"title":"Google AI’s Bias Couldn’t Be More Clear in Answers on NPR, PBS","text":"Are NPR and PBS biased? Should they receive taxpayer funding? Don’t ask Google. The company’s AI chatbot showed its bias when it answered by simply pushing the leftist legacy media outlets in question.\n\nGoogle showed a clear bias when MRC researchers asked “Are NPR and PBS biased?” and “Should NPR and PBS be defunded?” on March 25 and April 1. In its answers to the two prompts, Gemini cited NPR, PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (which both NPR and PBS are funded by in part) as sources nearly 59 percent of the time (a combined total of 17 times out of 29 sources listed). Gemini’s responses included only six links that did not favor taxpayer-funded public media like PBS or NPR. This is a continuation of a similar tactic used by Gemini last week, the day before NPR and PBS executives were brought before members of Congress to answer for their networks’ biased reporting. Neither prompt cited a single article by the Media Research Center, which has produced countless reports on the bias at NPR and PBS over the last 30+ years.\n\n“When it comes to NPR and PBS, Google’s bias could not be more clear here,” said NewsBusters Executive Editor Tim Graham. “Aside from perhaps NPR itself, no media entity has expended more ink over the decades on the question of NPR and PBS’s bias than the Media Research Center, and yet, at no point did Google even deign to mention the MRC as a source for either prompt. But this is just Google’s usual modus operandi, isn’t it?”\n\nWhen asked on April 1, “Are NPR and PBS biased?” Google’s Gemini simply concluded that whether NPR and PBS are biased “is a subject of ongoing debate” and that “they aim for objectivity” without citing any sources. When prompted to “double check response,” the chatbot proceeded to list sources supporting its points, the majority of which came from PBS itself.\n\nEven Gemini’s source explaining critiques of NPR and PBS bias cited PBS’s own coverage of the hearing about NPR and PBS’s bias. The chatbot proceeded to refer to this article a total of six times in its answers to the April 1 prompts.\n\nMRC researchers decided to follow up by asking whether it would be biased for an AI chatbot to primarily cite the source in question when asked whether that source is biased. Gemini flat out admitted, “Yes, it would.”\nThe chatbot aptly noted that “Organizations, including media outlets, often have a vested interest in defending their own objectivity.” The chatbot added that “A comprehensive assessment of bias requires considering a range of viewpoints, including those of critics, independent analysts, and academic researchers.”\n\nGoogle had a similar problem when asked, “Should NPR and PBS be defunded?” Gemini again cited PBS coverage as one of its sources showing that critics of NPR and PBS accuse it of having a liberal bias. However, this time, the chatbot also referred back to a press release for Rep. Strong’s proposed “No More Funding for NPR Act of 2025.” While there have been several other bills introduced with significant support, this is the only one Gemini referred to. \n\nThese results were very reminiscent of Gemini’s responses last week, just one day before the hearing.\n\nOn March 25, MRC researchers asked, “Are NPR and PBS biased?” and Google’s Gemini gave a very diplomatic, almost relativist response, explaining both sides of the issue, but downplaying the question as “subjective.”\n\n“What one person considers biased, another may view as objective reporting,” Gemini wrote. The chatbot then added, “Media bias is a broad and multifaceted issue, and it's essential to consume news from a variety of sources to gain a well-rounded understanding of events.”\n\nGemini, however, did not offer a “well-rounded” understanding of the issue, just as it failed to do a week later. The AI chatbot instead presented sources that included links to two PBS pages, an NPR article, the Wikipedia page for “Public Broadcasting in the United States” and an article by Free Press defending NPR. \n\nWhen MRC researchers asked “Should NPR and PBS be defunded?”on March 25, Google’s Gemini offered six points for each side of the argument, but when it listed its sources, a clear bias shined through. While there was one source that simply analyzed funding and media statistics, two sources were from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting — the organization that funnels federal funds to NPR and PBS. One was from an NPR affiliate, and another came from protectmypublicmedia.org in the form of an article headlined “How Federal Funding Cuts Would Devastate Local Public Media.” \n\nThe only right-leaning source Gemini cited on March 25 was an article by The Heritage Foundation headlined “Taxpayers Shouldn’t Have to Fund Biased, Woke Public Broadcasting.” The chatbot also included an article published by Broadband Breakfast with the headline, “Sen. Lee Proposes Bill to Defund NPR and PBS.\" Rep. Strong’s press release also appeared among Gemini’s sources. Not one of MRC’s countless articles on NPR and PBS’s overt bias appeared in Gemini’s source list. \n\nThis clear bias may be by design. Even former Vice President Kamala Harris said the quiet part out loud during a roundtable event at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. “[P]art of the issue here is what information is going into the machine that will then determine, and we can predict... what then will be produced in terms of decisions and opinions that may be made through that process,” she said.\n\nConservatives are under attack.

If you have been censored, contact us at the Media Research Center contact form, and help us hold Big Tech accountable.\n\nMethodology.\n\nFor this study, MRC Free Speech America asked Google’s AI Gemini to answer a series of questions on March 25 and April 1. The questions asked were as follows: “Are NPR and PBS biased?” and “Should NPR and PBS be defunded?” On April 1, researchers additionally asked, “Would it be biased for an AI chatbot to primarily cite the source in question when asked whether that source is biased?” \n\nMRC researchers examined the listed sources Google’s AI provided on March 25 and asked Gemini to “double check response” on April 1, which generated sources for its answer. Researchers then recorded the sources and content of the links that Gemini directed them to and analyzed whether the source defended or promoted publicly-funded media, including National Public Radio (NPR), Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).","summary":"Are NPR and PBS biased?
