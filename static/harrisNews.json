For the second time in a week, she will address a large convention inside the George R. Brown Convention Center. She arrived at Ellington Wednesday afternoon before heading to a downtown hotel for a political fundraiser at which she's raised a reported $2.5 million. Harris will then go to George R. Brown, where she will address the opening night session of the Sigma Gamma Rho sorority national convention. RELATED: VP Kamala Harris addresses teachers' union in Houston: 'I thank you for your service to our nation' She was in the city last week addressing the American Federation of Teachers, who endorsed her for president, and also took a tour of Houston emergency operations in the wake of Hurricane Beryl. A White House official told Eyewitness News that she will highlight how the Biden-Harris Administration has delivered historic investments that support communities, advance economic opportunity, and help people thrive. The vice president will also discuss protecting freedom. She says that includes the freedom for women to make decisions about their own bodies, the freedom to live safe from gun violence, the freedom to vote, the freedom to drink clean water and breathe clean air, and the freedom to learn America's full history. Harris will spend the night in Houston and then deliver the eulogy at the service for Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee on Thursday. All of this comes amidst an intensifying presidential campaign since President Joe Biden withdrew and gave her his support 10 days ago.

From the first question onward, the interview was filled with pointed queries about the former president's past comments about race, which Trump countered with defensive answers.\"I wish to personally express my sincerest gratitude to whomever it is on the Trump campaign who convinced Trump it was a good idea to have him appear before the @NABJ,\" Conway posted to X, formerly Twitter. The conservative attorney has been an outspoken critic of Trump and is the current president of the Anti-Psychopath PAC. \"Whoever you are, you are a true patriot, and your country is in your debt,\" Conway quipped.The NABJ interview kicked off with a question from Scott, who asked the former president why Black voters should \"trust\" him in November, given Trump's past comments directed at Black political leaders, including questioning whether former President Barack Obama was eligible to run for office. Trump also raised doubts about former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley's Indian heritage while she ran for the GOP presidential nomination.\"I don't think I've ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner, the first question,\" Trump said in response to Scott. \"You don't even say 'Hello. How are you?' Are you with ABC, because I think they're a fake news network, a terrible network.\"Later in the interview, Trump was questioned by Scott on claims that Vice President Kamala Harris is a \"DEI candidate,\" an attack that has been used by several conservatives that accuse Harris, a former attorney general and senator, of only being picked as the presumptive Democratic nominee because of her race.Trump responded, \"She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was Black until a couple of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black.\"Trump's demeanor throughout the interview was bashed by politicians and journalists. Harris' campaign also released a statement, saying that the \"hostility\" from Trump on Wednesday \"is the same hostility he has shown throughout his life, throughout his term in office, and throughout his campaign for president.\"The former president defended his performance in a post to Truth Social following the NABJ interview, writing: \"The questions were Rude and Nasty, often in the form of a statement, but we CRUSHED IT!\"Trump also defended his statements questioning Harris' racial heritage. In a separate post, he reshared a video from 2019 when Harris was running for the 2020 Democratic nomination, which featured the vice president making masala dosa, a traditional Indian dish, with Indian American comedian Mindy Kaling. In the video, Harris says her family is from South India.\"Crazy Kamala is saying she's Indian, not Black,\" Trump wrote in the post. \"This is a big deal. Stone cold phony. She uses everybody, including her racial identity!\"Harris is the first woman to serve as vice president and was born to a Jamaican father and Indian mother in Oakland, California. She also attended Howard University, a historically Black university, before getting her law degree from University of California Law San Francisco.Several conservative heads also rushed to Trump's defense, including Florida Congressman Byron Donalds, who told Fox Business that the NABJ was a \"hostile environment\" for Trump because \"a lot of Black journalists tend to lean Democrat.\"\"But Donald Trump was there to answer the questions about the things that do matter to Black America, that matter to all of America,\" Donalds added.Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk also wrote to X on Wednesday, \"Trump goes into hostile territory.

Today, the industry provides nearly half a million Keystone State jobs, contributing more than $75 billion to the state economy. With Vice President Kamala Harris’ ascension as the presumptive Democratic nominee, all the progress and hope hang in the balance. Should Harris become president, her policies and vision could make the first four dismal years of the Biden-Harris energy agenda pale in comparison. A quick check of the tape reveals a slew of concerns. Running for president in 2019, Harris declared, “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.” Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a proven drilling technology used for extracting oil, natural gas, geothermal energ, or water from deep underground. It is a cornerstone of Pennsylvania’s economy, especially in the Marcellus Shale region, supporting approximately 123,000 jobs, providing livelihoods for families across the state. President Biden’s pause on liquified-natural-gas exports this year sent ripples of concern through Pennsylvania’s natural-gas sector. The White House announcement went out of its way to say this was a Biden-Harris administration decision, not Biden’s alone. The move not only jeopardized jobs but undermined the economic stability of communities dependent on natural gas in my state and across the country. Criticism of the decision didn’t come just from opponents of the Biden administration. Both of Pennsylvania’s Democratic senators, John Fetterman and Bob Casey Jr., voiced their disagreement with the Biden-Harris LNG-export pause. After Biden’s ill-fated debate with Donald Trump, Fetterman emerged as one of the preident’s staunchest defenders, while Casey votes with Biden 99% of the time. Even Gov. Josh Shapiro, rumored as a possible Harris running mate, raised concerns about the pause. Their willingness to criticize speaks volumes about the policy’s misguided nature. A fracking ban would lead to the loss of thousands of jobs, devastating communities that rely on the industry. The economic impact would be severe, but the repercussions would not stop there. Energy prices would inevitably rise, placing an additional burden on families already struggling with inflation. Higher energy costs affect everyone, but they hit low- and middle-income households the hardest, especially when two-thirds of Americans report living paycheck to paycheck, per a MarketWatch analysis. Harris wouldn’t just stop there. In 2019, she emerged as a champion of the so-called Green New Deal, an extreme policy that calls for America to become entirely reliant on so-called “green” energy by 2050. The initiative’s chief supporter, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), has acknowledged the price tag would be as much as $10 trillion, which is ironically the same astronomical number Harris’ 2020 climate plan clocked in at. The Green New Deal would end production of all traditional forms of energy and the jobs it produces. For those out of work, Harris has called for “an ability to transition.” Hardly reassuring. As national Democrats have drifted further away from commonsense energy policies, they’ve been losing voters. The advantage of registered Democrats has withered down to just 4% in the state. Compare this with the 12% advantage as recently as 2008. The number of registered independents is also growing, another indication Pennsylvanians want leaders with a more moderate stance. Harris’ policies are not just bad for Pennsylvania energy — they’re a hard sell for Pennsylvania votes. That’s why the Harris campaign announced a sudden change of heart, claiming Harris no longer plans to ban fracking. Such a major policy reversal should come from the candidate herself, and not an anonymous campaign official. It’s safe to say the Harris campaign hopes we Pennsylvanians are gullible. Pennsylvania’s energy industry is not just about jobs and prices; it’s also about energy independence. The ability to produce and export natural gas strengthens the United States’ position in global energy markets and reduces dependence on foreign oil. This independence is crucial for national security and economic stability, both of which are undermined by Biden-Harris policies that target natural-gas production and exportation. Imagine how much worse it would get under a President Harris. My family has called Pennsylvania home for more than a century. I want to see my state prosper and its next generation have the same opportunities I did. That won’t be possible if the next president interferes with our ability to remain the second-largest energy producer in America. In November, we need an energy-policy shake-up, not a bolstering of the status quo. Here’s hoping we get what we deserve. Joseph Pitts, a Republican, represented Pennsylvania in the US House of Representatives from 1997 to 2017, serving as a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and chairing its Subcommittee on Health.","summary":"Running for president in 2019, Kamala Harris declared, “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.”","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/31/us-news/kamala-harris-green-energy-policies-would-destroy-pennsylvanias-economy-and-hurt-every-american/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/AM23554.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-31 23:51:42","author":"Joseph Pitts","authors":["Joseph Pitts"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.012},{"id":253099312,"title":"Border Arrests in July Drop to Low Under Biden","text":"The number of arrests by border agents of migrants who crossed the southern border illegally in July is expected to fall under 60,000, according to three people with knowledge of the data, a precipitous drop from the record numbers of crossings that plagued the Biden administration just months ago. The July arrest numbers are set to represent the lowest monthly apprehensions under the Biden administration. The previous low came in January 2021, the month President Biden assumed office, when around 75,000 migrant apprehensions were made at the border. The plunge in arrests — border agents made around 250,000 in December alone — comes after the Biden administration imposed sweeping restrictions on asylum at the southern border in June for migrants who cross illegally in an effort to deter them from making the journey to the United States. The changes suspended longtime guarantees that gave anyone who stepped onto U.S. soil the right to seek a safe haven, allowing border officials to more quickly return migrants to their home countries or Mexico. The drop could provide a powerful counternarrative to what has been one of the Biden administration’s largest political weaknesses at a critical time before the November election.

J.D. Vance (R-OH) is ready for the vice presidency. Vance has received a torrent of animosity since he became Trump’s running mate, with many on the left branding him “weird.” Old clips have also resurfaced that Democrats have used to brand Vance as anti-woman. In a 2021 interview, he said “childless cat ladies” who work for the Biden administration, mentioning Harris in particular, are running the country. Nevertheless, the Harris campaign has used them as fuel against Vance, who is somewhat viewed as dragging down Trump, instead of lifting him up in support. One week after the running mate announcement, Vance’s favorability rating was down 6 points, according to CNN.

Brown asked Whitford if “all the craziness” is evoking any nostalgia for his time on the political drama show.

Hundreds attended for a door fee of $45. “The nightclub was so packed out, she had to stand on top of a table in order to be heard,” says then organizer Todd Hawkins of Hawkins Mikita, a social impact group that connects Hollywood with political and philanthropic causes. Hawkins has been active in leading various incarnations of young political organizations since 2006 when Gen44, a fundraising group that charged a $44 entry fee for such casual outings as nightclub events and basketball games was founded to support Barack Obama as the 44th president. Taking a page from bigwig Hollywood bundlers like Jeffrey Katzenberg and Haim Saban, Hawkins adopted the model of must-attend events with stars who connect with the younger demographic of Gen44. Celebrities like Jared Leto, Olivia Wilde, Kerry Washington, Darren Aronofsky and John Legend have attended, helped organize or performed at such events. In Los Angeles where donors and bundlers raise multiples of millions for their candidates, one may be inclined to overhype the cool factor while underestimating the political clout of groups like Gen44 — which later morphed into Young Professionals for Hillary Clinton, Young Professionals for Joe Biden and Young Professionals for Kamala Harris for several campaigns including the current Democratic presidential nomination. But they would be wrong. While such groups have collectively raised over $10 million from small donations, the real prize is in the candidates connecting with this elusive demographic and the energy it brings. “The excitement of the culture around Kamala Harris is evident in what we’re seeing right now, in viral videos, memes on TikTok, Brat, Megan Thee Stallion performing at the rally in Atlanta and things she says, like ‘Falling out of a coconut tree’ being remixed into music,” says Hawkins, who notes that he hasn’t seen this level of energy since 2012 with Obama. “She knows that the importance, power and energy of young people is so necessary to campaigns. And young people are excited about her joy and dancing, all of that.” Hawkins, who now serves on Harris’ National Finance Committee, where all the bundlers are housed under, will be first out of the gate with a grassroots fundraising event for the campaign. This time, the doors will open for everyone, not just young people. Only ten days after Harris was endorsed by President Biden as his choice for his successor, “A Dance Party for Kamala” will take place at legendary West Hollywood nightclub The Abbey on Thursday, Aug. 1 at 8:00 p.m. Hosted by Hawkins, his business partner Justin Mikita and The Abbey owner Tristan Schukraft, tickets are priced at $25 each to facilitate a high turnout of politically minded Angelenos, “be they seniors who like to dance or people voting for the first time,” says Hawkins. The money goes directly to the campaign, the Harris Victory Fund. Jesse Tyler Ferguson (who is married to Mikita), Glee‘s Darren Criss, Bachelor alumn Colton Underwood, RuPaul’s Drag Race star Jinkx Monsoon, Only Murders in the Building‘s Ashley Park, music artist Vincint and other celebrities and influencers will be special guests. The sense of urgency is real, says Hawkins: “We’re trying to quickly organize. In the past, we had two years ahead of the campaign to prepare, and now we only have 100 days or less. So we thought we’d kick off the movement with an easy dance party that’s open to everyone.” Angelenos can expect more fundraisers from this grassroots arm, which Hawkins says is planning more of these “unique events — we’re thinking about Artists for Kamala, Chefs for Kamala…” And while he hopes such events will add to the coffers being rapidly filled by donations from Zoom calls held by such identity groups as Black women and “White dudes” for Harris — totaling $81 million raised over several days — he remains cautious, noting that it takes $1 billion to run for president, and that former president Trump raised $400 million in the 48 hours following the assassination attempt. “And now the stakes are so much greater,” Hawkins says, “but there’s confidence and excitement and we want to make sure everyone has something that they feel they can do and an opportunity to contribute.”","summary":"Back when Kamala Harris was running for California attorney general in 2010, a young professionals group threw a campaign fundraiser at a now-defunct nightclub in Los Angeles called h.wood.

Speaking to black journalists in Chicago, Trump was asked about recent comments by a number of congressional Republicans arguing she was a “DEI hire” because President Joe Biden promised to select a woman as his vice president. The insinuation that Harris was not qualified for the job received reprimands from GOP leaders including Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), who reportedly urged his conference to focus instead on Harris’s liberal voting record as she vies to replace Biden in the White House. But Trump declined to do the same in his interview with the National Association of Black Journalists. Asked if he found the DEI comments “acceptable,” Trump proceeded to claim falsely that Harris, who is of Indian and Jamaican heritage, did not present as black later in her career. “You know what, I respect either one. But she obviously doesn’t. Because she was Indian all the way, then all of a sudden, she made a turn. And she became a black person. And I think somebody should look into that,” Trump said. Harris was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus during her time in the Senate and years before that a member of a black sorority at a historically black college. The remark received a reprimand from some corners of the GOP, most prominently former Gov. Larry Hogan, who is running for Senate in deep-blue Maryland. “It’s unacceptable and abhorrent to attack Vice President Harris or anyone’s racial identity,” he posted on X. “The American people deserve better.” But Senate Republicans, who are in Washington, D.C., until Thursday before a monthlong summer recess, either sidestepped the comments or stated that Republicans will lose the election if their focus is anywhere except policy. “I think the most important thing we can talk about is the policies and statements she’s made,” Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT), the chairman of Senate Republicans’ campaign arm, said of Harris. “They’re just very radical.” Sen. Thom Tillis, a centrist Republican from North Carolina, rattled off the border, national security, and the economy as the three issues that will send Republicans to Washington in November. “We focus on that, we win,” he said. “We shift focus away from it, we start losing.” The statements were directed at Republicans writ large, but the plea to Trump was unmistakable and in some cases explicit. “That’s advice to all my colleagues in North Carolina who are running for reelection and anybody else who wants to sweep this town,” Tillis said when asked if his comments were directed at Trump. “And we need to sweep this town.” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) defended Trump, denying he was questioning Harris’s black heritage but rather “making fun of the fact that she chooses it when it’s convenient.” But he, too, said the remarks were not helpful. “It just opens him up for this kind of questioning, even though I think, as I’ve always said, we should take him seriously, not literally.” Even close Trump allies steered clear of the racially tinged comments. “I don’t get into all that stuff,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) said. “Let him talk about what he wants to talk about. I’m talking about the bad shape our country is [in] right now because of her.” GOP lawmakers grew accustomed to fielding the periodic controversies that marked Trump’s first presidential campaign and eventually his four years in the White House. But the political fallout from Wednesday’s comments has taken on added significance as Republicans try to find their footing after Democrats swapped out Biden at the top of the ticket. Trump has begun to home in on Harris’s record, in particular her role as Biden’s so-called border czar. But his campaign has also been criticized for a lack of message discipline. Trump doubled down on the racial attacks, calling Harris a “stone cold phony” in a Wednesday post on Truth Social. “She uses everybody, including her racial identity!” he said. Senate Democrats quickly fundraised off the Trump interview, highlighting his comment that Harris “could be” a diversity hire. In an email, the Senate Majority PAC invoked Trump’s past “racist attacks,” including the times he doubted the authenticity of former President Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Harris’s campaign denounced Trump’s remarks at the NABJ conference as an “absolute disaster.” Meanwhile, the Trump campaign accused the media of engaging in “unhinged and unprofessional commentary,” including the insinuation that the interview was cut short because it was a “train wreck.”","summary":"Senate Republicans pleaded with former President Donald Trump to focus on policy Wednesday after he accused Vice President Kamala Harris of “turning black” to benefit herself politically.

We know in the past, she's been against certain trade deals that didn't have strong environmental protections in place, and she's also been against sanctions on certain products like solar panels. How do you see her pushing the needle on climate if she emerges as the next president? Dr Carolyn Kissane: It's a very fine line in the United States for a politician when it comes to energy and climate. In the past, as you pointed out, she has prosecuted Big Oil. She's taken Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and ExxonMobil. She has pushed very hard for environmental justice. She did that as a senator in support of the Green New Deal, which did not pass, but she was very strongly in support of, and she was the deciding vote on the passing of the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act). The interesting point, and this is where you have to be aware of in the United States as a politician in the position that Harris is in, is that the US is currently the largest oil and natural gas producer in the world. This is generally run by the private sector; we don't have a natural oil and natural gas company. So that's where Biden was challenged. You have this really strong oil and gas production, and you have some of those climate-forward legislations and funding for clean energy. It was hard for Biden to thread the needle on the messaging on that.","summary":"Ms Kamala Harris has years of green credentials on her resume.

And on Wednesday, the Oscar-winner, 49, and the Italian supermodel, 26, were spotted dining al fresco in Nerano before soaking up the sun on their yacht with pals. As the couple cozied up at their lunch table, Vittoria flashed a massive heart-shaped diamond ring on her left ring finger. Leonardo looked absolutely smitten with the bikini-clad beauty, often leaning in close to speak to her as they feasted on fine Italian cuisine. Vittoria also sported her heart-shaped diamond ring as she hopped aboard a tender with a slew of A-list pals. They were joined by Leonardo's BFF Tobey Maguire, British model Neelam Gill, Entourage star Kevin Connolly and former Vogue Editor-in-Chief Edward Enninful, among others. Leonardo DiCaprio's model girlfriend Vittoria Cerettti, 26, flashed a heart-shaped diamond ring on THAT finger as she vacationed with the Oscar-winner, 49, in Italy on Wednesday The couple were first spotted dining al fresco in Nerano Vittoria sported a similar heart-shaped ring on her right pinky finger Read More Leonardo DiCaprio, 49, and Tobey Maguire, 49, enjoy wet and wild trip with bikini models The couple — who have been dating since summer 2023 — first sparked engagement speculation earlier this year when Vittoria was seen wearing a silver diamond ring in LA. But an insider told TMZ at the time that the couple were not engaged and that she'd owned that particular ring since 2022. The heart-shaped ring appears to be a new addition to Vittoria's jewelry collection and it has renewed interest in the idea of Leonardo — Hollywood's most infamous Lothario — finally settling down. Vittoria also wore a similar ring on her right pinky finger during Wednesday's lunch date in Nerano. The runway maven looked fresh-faced and her brunette hair was pulled back as she spent quality time with Leonardo and his tight knit friend group. She wore a plunging black swimsuit cover-up over a skimpy white bikini with red piping. The cover girl had on black gladiator sandals and she carried her belongings in a colorful woven tote bag. Along with her flashy rings, Vittoria accessorized with layered chain necklaces and a large pair of designer shades. Meanwhile, Leo looked casual-cool in a beige Los Angeles Dodgers cap, a white T-shirt and sunglasses. He snacked on a delicious peach while Vittoria poured over the menu. At one point, Vittoria showed Leonardo something on her iPhone before he pulled out his own to snap a group selfie with everyone at their table. After lunch, Leonardo, Vittoria and friends exited the restaurant and made they way to a nearby boat that took them back to their yacht. Leonardo looked absolutely smitten with the bikini-clad beauty At one point, Vittoria was seen showing Leonardo something on her iPhone The couple often leaned in close to speak with one another Along with her flashy rings, Vittoria accessorized with layered chain necklaces and a large pair of designer shades Vittoria stunned as she let her hair down before taking a seat on the boat beside former Disney Channel star Emily Skinner, 21. Leonardo — who will turn 50 in November — carefully made the leap from the dock to the boat in kaki shorts and sandals. The couple were greeted by Tobey, who flashed a wide smile while wearing a black cap and black T-shirt. Leonardo's vacation crew arrived in Italy over the weekend. On Tuesday, Vittoria was spotted riding on the back of Tobey's jetski as they romped around in water. On Monday, Leo and Vittoria joined Tobey and the rest of their friends for an intimate dinner at Gritta Restaurant. Leo and Vittoria were first linked over the summer of last year, when she had just turned 25, and have been spotted together on several occasions since. However in March of this year, Leo was spotted putting on a cozy display at a pre-Oscars party with none other than songstress Teyana Taylor, with whom he has been filming the upcoming Paul Thomas Anderson movie. At the pre-Oscars party, Teyana was glimpsed gently caressing Leo's face, and he in turn was seen tapping her on the derriere, according to TMZ. However, later that same month, he was spotted enjoying a lunch date with Vittoria in Los Angeles, indicating their relationship was still going strong. Vittoria was even sporting a gleaming silver ring on her left hand fourth finger - but TMZ reported at the time that the couple were not engaged. After lunch, Leonardo, Vittoria and friends exited the restaurant and made they way to a nearby boat that would take them back to their yacht Vittoria stunned as she let her hair down before taking a seat on the boat beside former Disney Channel star Emily Skinner, 21 They were joined by Leonardo's BFF Tobey Maguire , British model Neelam Gill , Entourage star Kevin Connolly and former Vogue Editor-in-Chief Edward Enninful, among other elite guests The crew looked eager to get back to they yacht after lunch Leonardo — who will turn 50 in November — carefully made the leap from the dock to the boat in kaki shorts and sandals Leo looked casual-cool in a beige Los Angeles Dodgers cap, a white T-shirt and sunglasses After soaking up the sun, Vittoria decided to move to the other end of the boat for some time in the shade Near the end of March, Leo and Vittoria were spotted out to dinner at the Santa Monica celebrity hot spot Giorgio Baldi - and she then drove them from the venue. 'The restaurant has been Leo's favorite for years and he's enjoyed date nights with Vittoria several times,' an insider explained to People. 'She's, of course, Italian, so she takes care of ordering all the favorites,' said the source. 'She is very cute, sweet and charming. Leo seems to really like her.' Vittoria and Leo are said to have met at last year's Cannes Film Festival, where his new Martin Scorsese movie Killers Of The Flower Moon was premiering. They were first linked in August 2023, after a flurry of rumors that had connected Leo to Vittoria's fellow supermodel Gigi Hadid. Vittoria was previously married from 2020 until 2023 to the Italian DJ Matteo Milleri, who is part of the Berlin-based duo Tale Of Us. Years earlier, she was briefly linked to the model then known as Natalie Westling, who has since undergone a gender transition and is now called Nathan Westling. Vittoria was discovered in 2012 and has since walked over 400 fashion shows, as well as covering various international editions of Vogue 23 times. Vittoria has spoken candidly in the past about the habits that have enabled her to retain her lithe physique and luminous complexion. 'I always try to eat healthily. I go to the gym when I’m home or do some yoga if I have the time off,' she explained to Elite Model Look. 'I always make sure to wash my face at morning and at night, moisturizing my skin before I leave home or before I go to bed,' she added. more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Pax Jolie-Pitt steps out with mom Angelina in 2023 Watch video Tom Daley shares result of his Paris 2024 Olympics sweater Watch video Katie Price jets off to Turkey as warrant issued for her arrest Watch video Freddie Flintoff speaks out on near death fatal crash in new show Watch video Antiques Roadshow guest gobsmacked by valuation of medal Watch video Amanda Holden stuns in a black bikini during Greek vacation Watch video Weston Cage says mother 'needs help' as he leaves courthouse Watch video Bianca Censori covers up for Target run with Kanye West & kids Watch video Christina Fulton spotted as son Weston Cage pleads not guilty Watch video DJ Khaled shows off his huge fridge FULL of snacks and candy Watch video A French diver has sent Olympics fans wild Watch video Hydrogen-powered flying taxi completes 523-mile trip in USA At one point, Leo pulled out his cellphone to snap a group selfie with everyone at the table Leonardo snacked on a delicious peach while Vittoria poured over the menu The couple — who have been dating since summer 2023 — first sparked engagement speculation earlier this year when Vittoria was seen wearing a silver diamond ring in LA But an insider told TMZ at the time that the couple were not engaged and that she'd owned that particular ring since 2022 The heart-shaped ring appears to be a new addition to Vittoria's jewelry collection and it has renewed interest in the idea of Leonardo — Hollywood's most infamous Lothario — finally settling down 'I apply a face mask for when my skin feels tired or if I’ve worked for a while,' noted Vittoria, who originally hails from Brescia in the shadow of the Italian Alps. 'I try not to eat lots of junk food,' she told W. 'In the morning I always eat fruit and yogurt with cereal. And for lunch and dinner I always have vegetables as a side.' As far as beverages are concerned, she shared: 'I love smoothies and Vitamin Water, but I always have some iced tea in my fridge!' In the workout department, she dished: 'When I’m not working I go for runs. I live around many parks, so it’s nice to feel like you’re not surrounded by the city.'

So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” “Kamala’s team had a reply ready faster than a Kendrick diss,” Wood added, referencing that Harris campaign statement that denounced Trump’s “attacks and insults” and demanded he “stop playing games and actually show up” to the next presidential debate on September 10. Harris is both Black and South Asian, with an India-born mother and Jamaican father. She graduated from the historically Black Howard University in 1986, and became a member of the first Black Greek sorority the same year. Even though most Americans understand the concept of being interracial, and Trump’s new twist on his Barack Obama birtherism rumors are easy to fact check, users still took his words and ran with it, making #WhenITurnedBlack trend as high as #3 on X. Some users claimed they finally “turned Black” once they mastered the card game Spades. Others made the transformation after putting dinner leftovers away in recycled grocery tubs. Some “turned Black” because they instantly knew that any request to spend money outside the house would be answered with, “Do you have money for that?” Other’s think their Blackness was fully realized once they came to terms with Church being an all day event. Realizing that being “ashy” is really only a people of color problem. When you realize there’s a valid reason why you can’t invite just anyone to the cookout.

Jean-Pierre, a black woman, said Trump’s comment was ‘insulting.’ She also said, as vice president, Harris deserves ‘respect.’ ‘No one has any right to tell someone who they are, how they identify,’ Jean-Pierre said. Trump, in a confrontational, testy interview at the National Association of Black Journalist conference, repeatedly questioned Harris’ racial origins. His comments resulted in gasps from the audience of black reporters and push back from the journalists on stage questioning him. Trump started off the interview with a jab at Harris, his Democratic rival: ‘She was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she went, she became a Black person. I think somebody should look into that.’ Harris’ mother is South Indian and her father is from Jamacia. The vice president has always identified as both South Asian and black. ‘I respect either one. But she obviously doesn’t. Because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she went – she became a black person,’ Trump said, a day after Harris attended a rally in Atlanta with prominent black lawmakers and cheering supporters. ‘And now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?’ he said of Harris, who is the first Black, female, and South-Asian-heritage vice president in US history. During Jean-Pierre’s press briefing, NBC’s Peter Alexander read aloud Trump’s words and asked the press secretary for her reaction. ‘Wow,’ Jean-Pierre said. She shook her head as Alexander read Trump’s words. ‘What you just read out to me, is repulsive, is insulting,’ Jean-Pierre said. She went on to add: ‘It’s insulting for anybody – it doesn’t matter if it’s a foreign leader or former president – it is insulting.’ ‘She is the Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris. We have to put some respect on her name.’ Harris’ campaign condemned his remarks. ‘The hostility Donald Trump showed on stage today is the same hostility he has shown throughout his life, throughout his term in office, and throughout his campaign for president,’ said campaign communications director Michael Tyler. ‘Today’s tirade is simply a taste of the chaos and division that has been a hallmark of Trump’s MAGA rallies this entire campaign.’ Trump was in a fiery mood when he sat down with ABC News reporter Rachel Scott, Fox News anchor Harris Faulkner, and Semafor reporter Kadia Goba. The interview started almost an hour late for conflicting reasons. There were reports the former president was unhappy with the NABJ for fact checking his comments in real time. Trump claimed it was because the conference organizers had audio equipment problems. His comments during the interview sparked fury among black reporters. Karen Attiah, a co-chair of this year’s NABJ convention who resigned after Trump’s appearance was announced, wrote on X during his interview: ‘Oh my God. Oh my god.’ ‘I am so angry right now. N.A.B.J., this was a colossal mistake,’ she added later. April Ryan, a prominent black journalist who covers the White House and tangled with Trump when he was president, wrote: ‘Trump came into our home, a Black Press advocacy convention, and insulted us in our face. What is worse he was invited to do this by NABJ leadership. Shame!’ Trump was also unhappy with reports Harris would be allowed to address the group virtually. Originally both contenders were invited to appear in person. When Harris’ team said she could only do it virtually, organizers said no. But when black journalists attending the conference expressed their outrage that Trump would address them but Harris – who would be the first female black president if elected – would not, Harris was invited to do so via zoom. Trump reacted in fury to the news, noting he was told he had to fly to Chicago. ‘They told me and Crazy Kamala Harris that you could not do this Event with ZOOM — It is not allowed or acceptable! She declined, and I am getting ready to land in Chicago in order to be there. Now I am told that she is doing the Event on ZOOM. WHAT’S GOING ON HERE?,’ he wrote on Truth Social. All of it made for a visibly irritated Trump. He has played the race card before, notably back in the Barack Obama era when he promoted a racist birther conspiracy about the former president. Trump made a name for himself in national politics when he falsely claimed Obama was born in Kenya. At his appearance in Chicago on Wednesday, Trump was angry out of the gate. ABC’s Rachel Scott, who asked him the first question, probed him about the concerns black journalists had about his appearance, noting he has criticized black reporters in the past. ‘First of all I don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner,’ Trump told Scott. ‘You don’t even say hello how are you?’ Trump lectured, calling ABC a ‘fake news network.’ ‘I came here in good spirit. I love the black population of this country,’ he said. ‘I think it’s a very rude introduction. I don’t know exactly why you would do something like that,’ he said. And he offered this: ‘I have been the best president for the black population since Abraham Lincoln.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe White House slammed Donald Trump on Wednesday for his comments on&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The White House denounces Donald Trump&#8217;s statement on Kamala Harris becoming a black person as &#8216;repulsive&#8217;. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/the-white-house-denounces-donald-trumps-statement-on-kamala-harris-becoming-a-black-person-as-repulsive/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-White-House-calls-Donald-Trump-repulsive-for.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-31 23:12:32","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.317},{"id":253097124,"title":"Trump returns for indoor Pennsylvania rally for first time since assassination attempt in state","text":"Donald Trump was in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on Wednesday for his first campaign rally in the swing state of Pennsylvania since he came within inches of being killed by a would-be assassin’s bullet earlier this month. The former president spoke at an indoor rally where thousands packed in to see him just hours after he appeared for a confrontational interview with the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) in Chicago. In that appearance, Trump insulted his opponent, Kamala Harris, and falsely accused her of lying about her race — stating that she recently “became Black”. Harris, who is biracial, is Black and Indian-American. He walked out to Lee Greenwood’s “Proud to be an American”, days after Greenwood himself appeared at the Republican National Convention and endorsed him. “As you know, this is my first rally since Butler,” Trump said. “We’re going back to Butler, by the way.” As supporters waited for Trump to speak Wednesday evening, a projector flashed images of news articles noting that Harris was the first Indian-American senator from California, a fact that does not change her biracial identity. Secret Service agents were once again in charge of the former president’s security on Wednesday as the agency faces bipartisan condemnation for the assassination attempt at Trump’s rally earlier this month in Butler, Pennsylvania. The director of the agency resigned after a heated congressional hearing last week, and her acting successor has said that he is “ashamed” of the security lapses which led to a roof of a building being unsecured during Trump’s July 13 speech in Butler, allowing suspect Thomas Crooks to allegedly scale the building and fire several shots at the ex-president with a rifle. Trump was wounded in the ear during the attack, falling to the ground momentarily before standing back up and clutching a bloody ear. He raised a fist to the crowd and yelled, “fight!” several times before being led off the stage by Secret Service agents. Crooks was shot and killed by a Secret Service sniper after firing at the president; during the attack, he killed one rallygoer, retired fire chief Corey Comperatore. Two others were wounded besides the ex-president. “Corey is a hero to all of us,” Trump said, provoking a chant of “Corey!” from the crowd. He went on to ask for a moment of silence, remarking afterwards: “That is the most quiet I have ever heard an arena.” On Wednesday, a spokesman for the city of Harrisburg told a local news station that Secret Service agents were “overseeing everything” at Wednesday’s rally, adding: “after that, it becomes a Pennsylvania State Police detail and because the farm show is a state-owned building, [Pennsylvania] Capitol Police are involved as well.” This is a breaking news story.

The revamp of the convention, which kicks off Aug. 19, includes moving away from a very heavy use of pre-taped pieces, which had been in the works while Biden was the nominee, to doing more of the convention live. That’s because the energized crowds Harris is drawing guarantees that the vibe at the United Center will visually translate to voters watching the prime-time “show.” A Democratic strategist plugged into convention planning told me, “showing the on-the-ground energy and enthusiasm for Harris is the top objective of the convention.” A source told the Chicago Sun-Times that Hollywood filmmaker Steven Spielberg, who had been advising the Biden campaign, is staying in the saddle to help shape the convention and make the Biden handoff to Harris seamless. I’m told second gentleman Doug Emhoff is already working on the prime-time speech he will deliver, with the intent to throw a spotlight on the first man to be the spouse of a vice president — and who may be the nation’s first gentleman. As forecast in my Tuesday column, convention officials have now confirmed that former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton will be part of the convention. The nights they speak — and whether they go on different days — has yet to be locked in. Roles for the 2016 Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton and former first lady Michelle Obama at the convention are still in the works. Monday night, Aug. 19 Biden will be the showcased speaker, delivering the opening remarks with the revamped prime-time programming to turn into a Biden tribute and recognition of his legacy. This is the biggest change and first reported by CNN. Sources told the Sun- Times details about honoring Biden are still being finalized. Until Biden dropped out on July 21, he was going to cap the convention on the last night with his acceptance speech. Also in the works — and like everything else, this can change — a salute to host city Chicago is on the drawing board. Also in line for speaking slots are Gov. J.B. Pritzker (who of course would speak if he was tapped to be vice president); Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Senators Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin. Tuesday, Aug. 20 A highlight will be the ceremonial roll call. Harris will arrive at the convention in Chicago already nominated in order to insure she is on the ballot in Ohio and some other GOP-run states. Delegates start virtually voting for Harris this Thursday, with balloting open until Monday. She will be the only name on the ballot, since no one else qualified by the Tuesday deadline. Harris is expected to name her running mate in the coming days. That person would not need a separate roll call to become part of the ticket under convention rules. The Harris campaign announced that her VP pick will appear with her Tuesday in Philadelphia. Wednesday, Aug. 21 The highlight is the vice presidential nominee’s acceptance speech. Thursday, Aug. 22 Harris delivers her acceptance speech. Each day, the convention will kick off with delegation meetings at the eight hotels in downtown Chicago where all the delegates will be housed. From there, there will be press briefings and meetings of Democratic groups in McCormick Place. The action will shift to the United Center in the early afternoon, with the main speakers to be scheduled for prime time. Matt Hill, a spokesman for the Democratic National Convention Committee, said in a statement that the “convention is our opportunity to tell our story directly to the American people, rally behind the Democratic nominees, and grow our broad and diverse coalition to defeat Donald Trump. “We look forward to sharing more soon about our convention in Chicago where Democrats will offer a forward-looking vision for our country that stands in stark contrast to the extremism from Donald Trump’s convention that would take America backwards.” The Democratic strategist told me that another switch is that with Harris leading the ticket, “a lot more of the celebrity stars and talents are now interested in participating in a way that was not so when Biden was at the top of the ticket.” The aim is to create a high energy for four days and snare a massive viewing audience, the strategist said. “People are going to tune in much more than in recent conventions because of the newness of the the Harris candidacy.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2024/07/31/democratic-national-convention-chicago-kamala-harris-programming","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d28fe2e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8461x4830+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8f%2F38%2F138b3b8640d19e9b15b686eb4a01%2Felecti","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-31 23:05:27","author":"Lynn Sweet","authors":["Lynn Sweet"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.048},{"id":253097630,"title":"Maduro warns he'll call for a 'new revolution' if forced by 'North American imperialism'","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories BREAKING BREAKING | Sport court dismisses Canada's appeal in women's soccer case The Court of Arbitration for Sport has dismissed Canada's appeal of a six-point penalty against its Olympic women's soccer team.

Its endorsement on Wednesday is not much of a surprise, given that the group had previously endorsed President Joe Biden before he withdrew his reelection bid. Trump, who previously fought for the UAW endorsement, has repeatedly criticized the union's president, Shawn Fain.The UAW said in a statement to its website that Harris' campaign plans to travel to Detroit on August 7 to rally with Michigan voters and \"thousands of working class people.\"\"Our job in this election is to defeat Donald Trump and elect Kamala Harris to build on her proven track record of delivering for the working class,\" Fain said in the statement.Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign via email for comment on Wednesday.Harris has been riding a wave of momentum for her candidacy since entering the 2024 race. Several polls, including one released by The Economist/You Gov on Wednesday, show that the vice president has narrowed or erased the lead that Trump held in the days leading up to Biden dropping out.When presented with a hypothetical matchup between Harris and Trump, 46 percent of the 1,610 adults surveyed by The Economist/You Gov survey said they backed the vice president, while 44 percent favored Trump. The lead is within the poll's margin of error of 3.3 percent. The results were collected from July 27 to July 30.In a poll conducted from June 30 to July 2, Trump was beating Biden 42 percent to 40 percent. From July 13 to July 16, the former president still held a 2-point lead over Biden (43 percent to 41 percent).Wednesday's poll from The Economist/YouGov also found that Harris has a higher favorability rating that Trump or his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance. While Harris has a net favorability rating of negative 4 percentage points, Trump's net rating was negative 9 points. Vance was the lowest, with a net favorability rating of negative 11 points.Harris also received a boost in several critical swing states this week. According to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consultant poll released Tuesday, the vice president had gained on Trump across seven battleground states, holding a 1-point lead over the former president.At the beginning of the month, the pollster's survey showed Biden trailing Trump by 2 percentage points across the states surveyed, which include Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.","summary":"The United Auto Workers union announced its endorsement of the vice president on Wednesday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-lands-key-endorsement-polls-show-gains-1932892","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2440384/kamala-harris-lands-key-endorsement.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-31 23:01:38","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.053},{"id":253097508,"title":"Trump attacks Harris’ racial identity, saying she opted to ‘turn black’ for political gain","text":"Donald Trump suggested Wednesday that Vice-President Kamala Harris had decided to “turn black” for political gain, as he attacked his Democratic White House rival during a combative and inflammatory interaction with African-American journalists in Chicago. The Republican former president’s provocation marked an escalation of the 78-year-old’s vitriol against Harris, whom he falsely accused of having identified as Indian but then, “all of a sudden, she made a turn, and she became a black person.” Harris, who has long identified as black and graduated from a historically black university, “was always of Indian heritage” but then “happened to turn black”, Trump told a conference of the National Association of Black Journalists. “So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she black?” I think it’s disgraceful. I have been the best president for the black population since Abraham Lincoln Donald Trump, US Republican presidential candidate Trump’s identity assault was at the heart of a hostile interaction with black reporters, one of whom he berated for asking about his history of offensive remarks about black people. “I think it’s disgraceful,” he said of the questioning. “I have been the best president for the black population since Abraham Lincoln.” The combative remarks by Trump, who has been eager to improve his performance with black voters, are likely to send shock waves through the 2024 White House contest. They come as the former president, convicted two months ago of fraud related to hush money payments to a porn star, struggles to formulate a new strategy less than 100 days before the election. He holds a campaign rally later on Wednesday in Pennsylvania, a battleground state where he narrowly survived an assassination attempt earlier this month. The Republican’s White House bid was thrown into chaos on July 21 when US President Joe Biden, 81, withdrew his candidacy, backing Harris as the Democratic nominee. Since then, the 59-year-old Harris has seen her favourability ratings jump and raked in US$200 million in campaign donations. Trump, who had placed Biden’s health at the heart of the election, now finds himself up against someone nearly two decades his junior, a trailblazer who became the country’s first black, female and South Asian-origin vice-president. The seismic shake-up has forced Trump and the Republicans to recalibrate rapidly, and it appears they are struggling to settle on a line of attack. As “Lyin’ Kamala”, “Laughin’ Kamala” and “Crazy Kamala” all failed to stick, Trump’s broadsides have become increasingly incendiary and untethered to reality. Over the past week, Trump has falsely accused the vice-president of being antisemitic – despite her decade-long marriage to a Jewish man, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff – and has claimed outrageously that she supports the murder of newborn babies. The Harris campaign slammed Trump’s Wednesday remarks as “personal attacks and insults” and the latest example of “the same hostility he has shown throughout his life”. Harris, whose mother was an Indian immigrant and father was Jamaican, has long identified as black. “My mother was very well aware that she was raising two black girls to be two black women, and she did that instilling in us pride in our culture and cultures,” she said in a 2020 Biden-Harris video. Trump and Republicans have launched more traditional political attacks, highlighting Harris’s pivots on positions she took while trying to carve out a lane in the crowded 2020 Democratic presidential nominating contest. Harris no longer supports abolishing private health insurance or a government buy-back scheme for guns. She has also disavowed positions against fracking and in favour of expanding the Supreme Court. “San Francisco liberal @VP Kamala Harris can’t decide where she stands on the most basic issues,” Oklahoma Senator Markwayne Mullin posted on X. And Trump suggested in an interview this week with Fox News that Harris would be considered weak and “like a play toy” by other world leaders. “They’re going to walk all over her,” he said. The messaging appears to have had little impact, as Harris has erased Trump’s lead in multiple key battleground states in the days since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee, according to a new Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll. Saturday will see Trump head to Atlanta, Georgia, where he will campaign alongside running mate J.D. Vance. The 39-year-old senator from Ohio was once a staunch critic of Trump, but changed his tune to become one of his most vocal supporters. Since Vance’s selection as Trump’s running mate, a series of videos of controversial past statements have emerged, including one in which he mocks some Democratic women as “childless cat ladies”. Harris travels later on Wednesday to Houston, Texas, to address a gathering of African-American students.","summary":"At the National Association of Black Journalists conference, Trump said Harris identified as Indian but then ‘she became a black person’.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3272710/trump-attacks-harris-racial-identity-saying-she-opted-turn-black-political-gain","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/08/01/966cbaca-fd9a-4b46-a910-b37434f688ce_898e702e.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/07/22/web%20video.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-31 23:00:42","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.207},{"id":253097244,"title":"Trump Is More Than OK With Childless Cat Ladies","text":"Donald Trump revealed Wednesday that unlike his running mate, he’s just fine with childless cat ladies.

According to a poll done by The U.S. Sun, voters are losing their faith in the Vice President and her caliber to defeat former President Donald Trump in the upcoming elections of POTUS 2024. \"Harris Honeymoon\" which indicates the rising popularity of the VP seems to have plunged low and is expected to go down further as voters think of defeating Trump. Nearly a quarter of the 1,000 people involved in the survey conducted by Talker Research think that Harris is qualified enough to stand against the ex-POTUS, while a third of the voters believe otherwise. As of now, no candidate has stepped ahead to challenge the Vice President's bid. The poll also reveals that 28 percent of the voters who took part in the survey believe that it is very unlikely that Harris will be able to defeat the businessman-turned-politician. While only 26 percent of voters think that she is competent enough to give a hard blow to the Republican frontrunner in the presidential elections and become the first woman President of the USA. According to the poll over three-quarters which means 77 percent of Democrats think that Harris can defeat Trump, and only 14 percent of Republicans think it can be possible. Tony Fabrizio branded the \"Harris honeymoon\" who is also a Trump supporter. \"The honeymoon will be a manifestation of the wall-to-wall coverage Harris receives from the [mainstream media,] Before long, Harris' 'honeymoon' will end and voters will refocus on her role as Biden's partner and co-pilot,\" he wrote to staff as reported by Newsweek. Harris was endorsed by President Joe Biden after he announced that he would be stepping down from the race against Trump earlier this month. Over the past week, $200 million in contributions have been collected by the Harris campaign. According to the NY Times, Steve Sisolak, the former Democratic governor of Nevada also sided with the idea that Harris' fame among Democrat voters will soon dip, \"I would call it a honeymoon phase. We’ve got to keep the energy going. You got it started — now you’ve got to keep it going. It’s going to be a challenge for everybody.\" Harris who was also the running mate for Biden during his campaign is now set to look for her running mate for the position of Vice President. President Biden dropped down from the race after around thirty Democrats openly urged him to do so to pave the way for younger leaders. After his announcement, the incumbent POTUS posted on Instagram, \"My fellow Democrats, I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term. My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this,\" as he expressed his faith in his then-running mate Harris.","summary":"&#34;Harris Honeymoon&#34; which indicates the rising popularity of the VP is expected to go down further as voters think of defeating Trump.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/harris-honeymoon-is-coming-to-an-end-as-a-third-of-voters-believe-kamala-is-less-qualified","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/708330/uploads/61699740-4f2c-11ef-b55a-519dd423333d_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-31 23:00:05","author":"INQUISITR,Tavishi","authors":["INQUISITR","Tavishi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.045},{"id":253096462,"title":"Charli XCX fans 'work out' Billie Eilish duet coming soon thanks to very subtle clue","text":"Billie Eilish fans are certain she is set to release a huge new track with a British pop star. The American singer-songwriter, 22, has world-wide success thanks to her hits including Bad Guy and Birds of a Feather. However, many fans think her next move will be with one of the UK's biggest stars at the moment. Fans have predicted Billie is set to release a collaboration with Charli XCX. The pop star's latest album Brat has become the soundtrack of summer already and has launched a whole cultural movement. Charli XCX, real name Charlotte Emma Aitchison, is leading Brat and thrown it into the mainstream. In an interview on BBC Radio’s Sidetracked podcast, Charli explained: \"It can [also] be so trashy just like a pack of cigs and a BIC lighter and like a strappy white top with no bra, and that’s kind of all you need.\" In a post to her fans, Charli teased: \"Brat summer is only just beginning [smiley face].\" There are rumours she could be releasing a Brat remix album. It could be coming sooner than expected as Charli posted a snap on her X account of herself next to another person, with their identities covered. However, it didn't take long for fans to become certain about who was stood next to Charli. Her caption read: \"Guess?,\" and her fans did just that. Many pointed out the rings on the person were identical to ones snapped on Billie. One said: \"the rings… it’s billie eilish yall omggg.\" Another added: \"is that billie-.\" Someone else commented: \"Billie?!?!\" A fourth wrote: \"BILLIE X CHARLI I JUST FELL TO MY KNEEESSSS.\" Other fans expressed their excitement at the potential collab as one said: \"this will be INTERESTING oh im tuned in.\" Another wrote: \"this might actually break the internet.\" Someone else declared: \"OMG BEST DUO AT THE GRAMMYS IS HERE.\" Charli narrowly missed out on the number one spot with her album to Taylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department, but the 31-year-old has thanked her fans who have stuck with her since the start of her career and \"understand\" her. She recently admitted she knows she isn't \"everyone's cup of tea\" before performing 'Sympathy is a Knife' at her Los Angeles concert last month. The singer said: \"I already know I'm not everybody's cup of tea, don't get me wrong, but um, I am just really appreciative for the people who've been there from the jump and understood my vision. I don't know. The whole thing that's going on at the moment, people keep texting me, 'You're having a moment. A moment.\" Charli has even showed her support to US Vice President Kamala Harris by branding her as a \"brat\". Following Biden's announcement that he was \"giving full endorsement and support to Kamala's nomination for our party\", Charli posted on X: \"Kamala IS brat.\" Providing an explanation into her unique use of the term \"brat\", Charli said: \"You're just like that girl who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things sometimes.\" She explained declaring a \"brat\" as someone \"who feels herself but maybe also has a breakdown. But kind of like parties through it, is very honest, very blunt. A little bit volatile.\" Charli added: \"Like does dumb things. But it's brat. You're brat.

Venture capitalists Reid Hoffman and Vinod Khosla, and media mogul Barry Diller, who have together donated millions of dollars to Harris’ now-principal campaign committee and associated PACs, were quick to call out Khan as a “dope” who is “waging war” on their business interests — and argue she should be sacked. The anger at Khan comes as the FTC investigates companies in which each man has a financial interest. At least five portfolio companies in which Khosla has invested are currently facing FTC investigations, The Post has learned. Khosla, worth an estimated $7.5 billion according to Forbes, took to X Wednesday to echo Hoffman’s comments that Khan needs to go. It’s unclear which companies are in the crosshairs, but Khan’s portfolio includes behemoths like OpenAI and DoorDash. He had donated $413,000 to the Biden Action Fund in June before Harris’ ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket, federal campaign finance filings show. “That is deeply corrupt to call for this and pair it with a donation,” said the Biden-Harris administration source, noting anti-trust investigations into Microsoft, where Hoffman sits on the board, and subsidiaries of Diller’s IAC, which include Home Advisor and Match.com, Quartz reported. “By publicly calling for her to be removed, they’ve put Kamala in an impossible situation,” the source spilled to The Post. “The idea Kamala would fire a 35-year-old, brown, progressive icon is bananas.” Neither the Harris campaign nor Hoffman responded to a request for comment. Diller, who donated the maximum to the Biden-Harris re-election campaign last year as well as $100,000 to their PAC, told The Post on Wednesday that he regretted his criticisms of Khan’s intelligence — but not her aggressive anti-trust litigation. “Don’t know what was in my head during that interview — she’s anything but a dope — she’s smart!” he said. “I do disagree with her on competitive issues where I think the FTC has overreached.” But Hoffman in an interview with CNN on Tuesday afternoon doubled down his calls for Khan’s ouster, claiming that he was “not buying levels of influence.” “I would hope that Vice President Harris would replace her,” he told CNN anchor Jake Tapper, adding that his opinion as a “donor and expert should be kept secre– separate.” The LinkedIn cofounder, who has given at least $7 million so far this year to the Harris-aligned Future Forward PAC, went on to say, “I don’t ever show up at the White House saying, ‘I think you should do this.’” But in December 2023, visitor logs show Hoffman took meetings with White House aides including Rachel Chiu, who serves as a special assistant to the president and chief of staff at the Office of Political Strategy and Outreach. The Democratic megadonor funneled $923,000 to the then-Biden Victory Fund, now Harris Victory Fund, a little more than two weeks after the West Wing sit-down. “When I speak to these things, I speak more as a venture capitalist — I never speak as a Microsoft board member,” Hoffman went on to tell an incredulous Tapper. “I’ve never had a conversation with Kamala Harris about this.” “There aren’t like a hundred Reid Hoffman[s],” Tapper shot back. “It’s not like one of you is a donor, and one of you has opinions on Lina Khan, and one of you is on the board of Microsoft and one of you is a venture capitalist.” “I don’t think there’s a politician alive that’s able to compartmentalize the way you’re suggesting they should,” he emphasized, before noting: “You and other donors went after Lina Khan pretty quickly after Biden announced he was dropping out of the 2024 race.” Hoffman refused to back down and even suggested that Harris “might watch our segment.” Still, he acknowledged that his support for Harris and disdain for Khan wasn’t doing the Democratic Party any favors given Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance’s backing of the FTC commissioner. “Lina Khan is the person I would point out as the best person within the Biden administration,” Vance had said at Bloomberg’s “RemedyFest” tech forum in February. “I like a lot of things that Lina Khan is doing.” The infighting between the Biden-Harris administration official and Democratic donors is revealing the party now “caters to corporate big tech interests,” one GOP operative told The Post “There was a left-wing populist movement and they used to be anti-Wall Street and anti-big tech but they aren’t anymore,” the operative said. “Vance thinks about antitrust; and they have a serious antitrust agenda and they’re probably more friendly to Khan,” the operative added. “They would probably want to focus on tech/media and give oil/gas a pass. But they agree that tech companies need scrutiny.” “The issue is they’re likely to use antitrust to pursue an agenda and she wouldn’t fall in line,” the source also said. “They want someone who can continue her record who will do Trump’s bidding.” Hoffman, sources also said, needs more friends in Washington as he and Microsoft face even more scrutiny from lawmakers. Over the last few weeks lawmakers have weighed investigating Microsoft in response to comments he made about his wish for Trump to be an “actual martyr,” according to the Washington Reporter. The company is also under fire following allegations they routed support calls made to Department of Defense contractors to China. Hoffman is both trying to ingratiate himself to candidates and trying to distance himself from anything controversial — including splitting from former adviser Dmitri Mehlhorn who suggested the assassination attempt on Trump could have been “staged.” Antitrust support has gone mainstream in recent years, with polling from YouGov showing nearly 70% of voters want antitrust action. The FTC declined to comment.","summary":"A source in the Biden-Harris administration is sounding the alarm about &#8220;deeply corrupt&#8221; calls from billionaire Democratic donors for Kamala Harris to fire commissioner Lina Khan if she wins the 2024 election – something the presumptive presidential nominee has yet to denounce.

Following Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 election and his endorsement of Harris as the Democratic candidate in the presidential race, talking points about the immigration record of the vice president began circulating among Democratic lawmakers.

During his widely panned appearance before the National Association of Black Journalists’ convention, where he attacked his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris's race and ethnicity, Trump was asked about J.D. Vance’s now famous and much memed assertion. ABC News’ Rachel Scott quoted Vance as once saying Democrats were “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they have made.” Did Trump know about this before he put Vance on the Republican presidential ticket, and does he agree with his potential future vice president, Scott asked. “I’m just speaking for myself,” the former president answered. “I think I’m speaking for him, too. He strongly believes in family. But I know people with great families. I know people with not great families, that don’t have a family, and the people without the family are far better. They’re superior in many cases, okay?” There’s a lot to unpack here. Trump, a father of five children with three wives, said people who don’t have families—who don't have children—are “superior in many cases.” Without stopping, he continued his defense of Vance. “He’s not saying they’re not. What he’s saying is that he thinks the family experience is a very important thing. It’s a very good thing,\" Trump said. \"But that doesn’t mean that if you grow up and you grow old and you don’t meet somebody that would be wonderful to meet, it would’ve been good, that that’s a bad thing.” Trump’s comments expanded on remarks he made to Fox News’ Laura Ingraham this week, when he said Vance just “feels family is good.” On Wednesday, at the NABJ gathering in Chicago, Scott pressed Trump further on whether his campaign backed a proposal Vance once floated to allow parents to cast more ballots than voters without children. “No, but it’s not something I’ve ever heard before,” he said, before pivoting to “illegal aliens” taking American jobs. When Semafor’s Kadia Goba called attention to Vance’s opinions about “childless women like myself or divorced people like yourself” and asked if Republicans were getting too “judgy,” Trump quickly tried to paint Democrats as the radical ones. “I think the Republican Party is actually much less—I think I’ve made them much less radical, perhaps,” Trump said. Trump's comments belied an awareness of how the Ohio senator has come to be viewed by GOP election-watchers: as a liability. The former president suggested Vance wouldn’t keep feline lovers or proud singles from supporting him in November. And he discounted Vance as a nothingburger. \"Historically, the choice of a vice president makes no difference,” he said. “You’re voting for the president. You can have a vice president who’s outstanding in every way—and I think JD is, I think that all of them would have been—but you’re not voting that way. You’re voting for the president. You’re voting for me.

Attiah said although a \"variety\" of factors influenced her decision, she said she wasn't consulted about giving Trump a \"platform\" at the convention.According to a press release announcing the Q&A session, Trump's campaign said the former President has \"accomplished more for Black Americans than any other president in recent history by implementing America First policies on the economy, immigration, energy, law and order, and foreign policy.\"Trump has continued to use media platforms to share misleading and untruthful claims throughout his campaign, including via major networks. Newsweek found many of Trump's claims did not hold water.Newsweek has contacted media representatives for Donald Trump via email for comment.\"Kamala refused to attend\"Donald Trump began making misleading claims even before the Q&A began, saying on Truth Social on Wednesday morning that Kamala Harris had refused to attend the event.\"Crazy Kamala disrespectfully refused to attend the National Association of Black Journalists Conference, but I am on my way to meet with them now in Chicago. Because of which, she'll probably end up doing, she has no choice, but remember—it is only for that reason!\" Trump wrote.However, NABJ states it had been in contact with Harris for an in-person panel before President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race. It is now \"in conversation\" with the Harris team to schedule a Q&A session at some point in September.NABJ President Ken Lemon said: \"The last update we were provided (earlier this week) was that Harris would not be available in person or virtually during our Convention.\"We are in talks about virtual options in the future and are still working to reach an agreement.\"Trump later complained about NABJ saying he had been told he could not do the event via Zoom, later learning that Harris \"is doing the Event on Zoom.\"\"WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?\" he said.A spokesperson for Harris told Newsweek that Trump's claim about her \"refusal\" to join was incorrect.Newsweek has contacted the NABJ for comment.While Harris may have declined or been unable to attend the event, Trump's claim that she had \"refused\" to do it makes it appear that Harris' decision has been guided by principle, not scheduling, which there seems to be no evidence of.Trump created \"one of the greatest programs ever for Black workers\"After complaining about his introductory question, Trump praised his record on creating employment opportunities for Black Americans, mentioning \"Opportunity Zones.\" Part of Trump's 2017 tax plan, the Opportunity Zone program offered millions in capital gains tax breaks to developers to invest in low-income zones chosen by the states.\"I've done so much for the Black population of this country, including employment, including Opportunity Zones with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, which is one of the greatest programs ever for Black workers and Black entrepreneurs,\" Trump said.The evidence that it had a positive impact on Black workers is mixed. A 2023 paper published in the Journal of Urban Economics found Opportunity Zones had \"small positive effects\" in areas with above median Black population in some states, although the effect was muted elsewhere.There does not appear to be other analysis that suggests the program was \"one of the greatest\" for Black workers.\"Saving\" Historically Black Colleges and UniversitiesTrump also said that he provided funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and \"saved them\" at a time when \"nobody else was doing it.\"\"Historically Black Colleges and Universities were out of money,\" Trump said.\"They were stone-cold broke and I saved them and I gave them long-term financing and nobody else was doing it.\"The significance of Trump's contributions is disputed.In 2019, Trump signed a bipartisan bill intended to provide more than $250 million a year to historic Black colleges, reported the Associated Press.However, speaking to The Washington Post, Marybeth Gasman, a Rutgers professor and authority on HBCUs, said Trump's involvement was likely to have been limited.\"Congress does all this work and presents it to him in the budget, and he can choose to sign it,\" Gasman said.\"Under Trump, the White House Initiative for HBCUs was moved to the White House and is quite quiet compared to the work under President Obama's administration,\" Gasman added.As stated by PolitiFact in 2020, HBCUs received funding during Barack Obama's presidency under the same program that Trump signed and there was little change between the two presidents in total funding.Kamala Harris \"turned Black\" Trump would also claim that Kamala Harris had \"turned Black\" when asked a question related to accusations from Republicans that Harris was a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) hire.\"She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,\" he said.\"So, I don't know. Is she Indian or is she Black?\"Harris has spoken at length about her mixed heritage, as the daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother. She has said that her mother deliberately raised her and her sister as Black because of how the world would see them. She also attended Howard University, an HBCU in Washington, D.C.In her 2019 autobiography, The Truths We Hold, Harris wrote about being raised with an appreciation and understanding of both Indian and Black culture.\"My mother understood very well that she was raising two Black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as Black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud Black women.\"Kamala Harris is the \"border czar\" Trump criticized what he called Kamala Harris' appointment as a \"border czar\" saying that the vice president was \"allowing\" the interception of millions of undocumented migrants.\"She's the border czar, she's the worst border czar in the history of the world,\" Trump said.While Kamala Harris was appointed under the Biden administration to lead diplomatic efforts to \"address the root causes of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras\", the White House has said that she was not put in charge of the border, as the term \"border czar\" could suggest.Trump says inflation \"in my opinion\" is worst everWhile conceding that according to some had been at its worst in \"58 years\", Trump suggested that, in his view, U.S. inflation had been at its worst rate ever during the Biden administration.\"We had in my opinion, the worst inflation we've had, they say it's 58 years, but I think it's much more than that,\" he said.\"It's been devastating.\"Apart from the fact that inflation is calculated, not speculated, Biden's high of 9.1 percent has been surpassed considerably in U.S. history, even more recently than 58 years ago hitting 14 percent in 1980.Trump also falsely claimed that interest rates increased from 2.4 percent to \"10 percent\" under Biden, a figure not supported by data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis which shows the annual rate hit 8 percent in 2022 compared to highs of only 2.4 percent under Trump.Prosecutors said Biden was \"incompetent\"While addressing charges relating to his possession of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, Trump attacked President Biden, saying that prosecutors hadn't pursued him of similar charges because he had been deemed \"incompetent.\"\"He had 50 years worth of documents, and they ruled that he was incompetent and therefore he shouldn't stand trial,\" Trump said.This is a misleading characterization of Special Counsel Robert Hur's report into Biden's handling of classified documents.Hur said that if Biden was charged, it would take years to bring to trial, at which point the president would be \"well into his eighties\", an age that would make such a trial more demanding.Hur said a jury would likely view him as \"a well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" However, Hur did not make any assessments about Biden's ability to stand trial, and he did not call him \"incompetent.\"\"Nothing happened\" to rioters in Seattle and Minneapolis Trump was also asked about January 6 and his pledge to pardon rioters. In response, Trump asked about other protests.\"How come the people that tried to burn down Minneapolis, how come the people that took over a large percentage of Seattle, how come nothing happened to them?\" he said.This appeared to refer to protests that took place across the country following George Floyd's death in May 2020. There are multiple records of arrests and sentences for the destruction caused following arrests in Minneapolis and Seattle.In 2021, Victor Devon Edwards, 32, was sentenced to 100 months in prison for \"burning, looting, and damaging stores and businesses in downtown Minneapolis on August 26, 2020\" while Dylan Shakespeare Robinson, 23, was sentenced to four years in prison for his role in a police station fire in Minneapolis,Margaret Aislinn Channon, 26, was sentenced to five years in prison for setting five police cars on fire during protests in Seattle, reported Fox13 Seattle.The Associated Press found in a review of court documents that in the more than 300 federal cases that followed the George Floyd protests, more than 120 defendants pleaded guilty or were convicted of federal crimes.As the Associated Press notes, however, some defendants received lenient deals, including no prison time or time served.Other false claims Trump repeated included that other countries had opened up their \"mental institutions\" to flood the U.S. with undocumented migrants, a claim that has been previously debunked by Newsweek.","summary":"Donald Trump's appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists Chicago has stoked controversy","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-talk-national-association-national-association-black-journalists-fact-check-1932738","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2440084/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-31 22:48:54","author":"Tom Norton","authors":["Tom Norton"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":253097034,"title":"'Full white-power': Trump lawyer blasted for blatant 'racism' during PA rally","text":"Just hours after Donald Trump said to a room of Black journalists that he \"didn't know\" Vice President Kamala Harris \"was Black until a number of years ago,\" one of the ex-president's lawyers also suggested that she also doesn't know the presumptive Democratic nominee is Black.

By MATT BROWN and MICHELLE L. PRICE Associated Press July 31, 2024 at 10:47PM Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump shakes hands with ABC's Rachel Scott, at the National Association of Black Journalists, NABJ, convention, Wednesday, July 31, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) (Charles Rex Arbogast/Associated Press) CHICAGO — Donald Trump falsely suggested Kamala Harris had misled voters about her race as the former president appeared before the National Association of Black Journalists in Chicago Wednesday in an interview that quickly turned hostile. The Republican former president wrongly claimed that Harris, the first Black woman and Asian American to serve as vice president, had in the past only promoted her Indian heritage. ''I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black. So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black?'' Trump said while addressing the group's annual convention. Harris is the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both immigrants to the U.S. As an undergraduate, Harris attended Howard University, one of the nation's most prominent historically Black colleges and universities, where she also pledged the historically Black sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha. As a U.S. senator, Harris was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, supporting her colleagues' legislation to strengthen voting rights and reforming policing. Trump has leveled a wide range of criticism at Harris since she replaced President Joe Biden atop the likely Democratic ticket last week. Throughout his political career, the former president has repeatedly questioned the backgrounds of opponents who are racial minorities. Michael Tyler, the communications director for Harris' campaign, said in a statement that ''the hostility Donald Trump showed on stage today is the same hostility he has shown throughout his life, throughout his term in office, and throughout his campaign for president as he seeks to regain power.'' ''Trump lobbed personal attacks and insults at Black journalists the same way he did throughout his presidency — while he failed Black families and left the entire country digging out of the ditch he left us in,\" Tyler said. \"Donald Trump has already proven he cannot unite America, so he attempts to divide us. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked during her briefing with reporters on Wednesday about Trump's remarks and responded with disbelief, initially murmuring, ''Wow.'' Jean-Pierre, who is Black, called what Trump said ''repulsive'' and said, ''It's insulting and no one has any right to tell someone who they are how they identify.'' Trump has repeatedly attacked his opponents and critics on the basis of race. He rose to prominence in Republican politics by propagating false theories that President Barack Obama, the nation's first Black president, was not born in the United States. ''Birtherism,'' as it became known, was just the start of Trump's history of questioning the credentials and qualifications of Black politicians. During this year's Republican primary, he once referred to former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, as ''Nimbra.'' Trump's appearance Wednesday at the annual gathering of Black journalists immediately became heated, with the former president sparring with interviewer Rachel Scott of ABC News and accusing her of giving him a ''very rude introduction'' with a tough first question about his past criticism of Black people and Black journalists, his attack on Black prosecutors who have pursued cases against him and the dinner he had at his Florida club with a white supremacist.

I love the Black population of this country. I've done so much for the Black population of this country.\" Trump continued his attacks on Scott's network, ABC News, which he has been arguing should not host the next presidential debate, despite his earlier agreement with the Biden campaign. He also several times described her tone and questions as ''nasty,'' a word he used in the past when describing women, including Hillary Clinton and Meghan the Duchess of Sussex. The Republican also repeated his false claim that immigrants in the country illegally are ''taking Black jobs.'' When pushed by Scott on what constituted a ''Black job,'' Trump responded by saying \"a Black job is anybody that has a job,\" drawing groans from the room. At one point, he said, \"I have been the best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln.'' The audience responded with a mix of boos and some applause. Scott asked Trump about his pledge to pardon people convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and specifically whether he would pardon those who assaulted police officers. Trump said, ''Oh, absolutely I would,'' and said, ''If they're innocent, I would pardon them.'' Scott pointed out they have been convicted and therefore are not innocent. ''Well, they were convicted by a very, very tough system,'' he said. At one point, when he was defending his supporters who entered the Capitol on Jan. 6, he said, ''Nothing is perfect in life.'' He compared the 2021 insurrection to the protests in Minneapolis and other cities in 2020 following the death of George Floyd by Minneapolis police and to more recent protests at the Capitol last week by demonstrators opposed to the war in Gaza. Trump falsely claimed that no one was arrested in those other demonstrations and that only his supporters were targeted. As Trump made the comparison, a man in the back of the room shouted out, ''Sir, have you no shame?'' The former president's invitation to address the organization sparked an intense internal debate among NABJ that spilled online. Organizations for journalists of color typically invite presidential candidates to speak at their summer gatherings in election years. As he campaigns for the White House a third time, Trump has sought to appear outside his traditional strongholds of support and his campaign has touted his efforts to try to win over Black Americans, who have been Democrats' most committed voting bloc. His campaign has emphasized his messages on the economy and immigration as part of his appeal, but some of his outreach has played on racial stereotypes, including the suggestion that African Americans would empathize with the criminal charges he has faced and his promotion of branded sneakers. Trump and NABJ also have a tense history over his treatment of Black women journalists. In 2018, NABJ condemned Trump for repeatedly using words such as ''stupid,'' ''loser'' and ''nasty'' to describe Black women journalists. The vice president is not scheduled to appear at the convention, but NABJ said in a statement posted on X that it was in conversation with her campaign to have her appear either virtually or in person for a conversation in September. Trump posted on his social media network that he was told he could not do the event virtually. ''She declined, and I am getting ready to land in Chicago in order to be there,'' Trump wrote. ''Now I am told that she is doing the Event on ZOOM. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?'' Trump was scheduled to hold a campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, later Wednesday. ___ Price reported from New York.

How Does Harris Poll Against Trump In Swing States? Multiple recent polls show Harris neck-and-neck with Trump. A Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll conducted last week found Harris leading Trump 53%-42% in Michigan, while a Fox News poll released last week found the two tied at 49%. Harris also held a 49%-47% lead over Trump in Wisconsin, according to the Morning Consult poll, though Fox News showed her trailing by one point. The Morning Consult poll also found the two were tied at 47% in Georgia, while Harris maintained a narrow 49%-47% lead in Arizona, led Trump 47%-45% in Nevada and trailed him 46%-48% in North Carolina. News Peg Harris’ campaign slammed Trump for comments he made on her race at the National Association of Black Journalists convention on Wednesday (Harris’ mother is from South India and her father is from Jamaica). Speaking at the event, Trump claimed Harris “was always of Indian heritage,” but later “became a Black person.” Trump’s claim, which follows a string of attacks on Harris based on her race, is not true—Harris has said throughout her three-decade career in politics that she is Black and of Indian descent. Following the conference, Harris campaign spokesperson Michael Tyler said Trump’s comments represented a “taste of the chaos and division that has been a hallmark of Trump’s MAGA rallies.” Further Reading ForbesTrump-Harris Swing State Polls: Harris Leads By 1 Point Overall In Battlegrounds, Latest Survey FindsBy Sara Dorn ForbesTrump Claims Kamala Harris Only Recently Identified As Black - Here's Why That's Not TrueBy Brian Bushard ForbesHarris Rises In Election Betting Markets-But Bookmakers Still Favor TrumpBy Siladitya Ray Report the details...

As a practicing psychologist who has been an outspoken opponent of her relative for quite some time, Mary has laid forth all the reasons why she thinks Republicans are 'weird'. Her strategy was based on the same line of attack that Democrats and Vice President Kamala Harris are using against Republicans right now, by just calling the beliefs and ideas of their opponents 'weird.' In her most recent email newsletter, 'The Good In Us', the niece of the former president commented, \"He is a weak, fragile man who is yes, deeply weird and deeply disturbed. He needs to be mocked mercilessly. He told us recently, that the one thing he hates, probably more than anything else, is to be laughed at. For us not to laugh at him, not to mock him is to miss an opportunity. It isn’t mean or impolite or in bad form to mock and laugh at or make fun of somebody who wants to destroy us. We have to go full throttle because as we get closer to the election, we’re going to see the terms of the fight unfold, and as bad as what they’ve been saying so far has been, it’s going to get worse.\" She went on to criticize Trump's running partner and added, \"By adding J.D. Vance to the Republican ticket, Donald has increased the level of creepy weirdness exponentially, and the Harris campaign and its allies are taking every opportunity to capitalize on it. And, like the most effective political attacks, it works in part because it’s true.\" Mary went on to criticize Vance's 'childless' comment and added, \"It’s weird to worship a fascist game show host while pretending to be a Christian. It’s weird to complain that childless cat ladies are the real problem facing America; it’s weird to believe in 'menstrual surveillance.' It’s weird to attack people who don’t have kids just because they don’t have kids. It’s weird to have a fetish for weapons of mass death. It’s weird to get angry at Star Wars and Disney movies or hate c.\" It follows the resurfacing of Vance's comments from 2021, in which he made some very improper comments about women in politics on Tucker Carlson's Fox News program. He called Vice President Harris one of the 'childless cat ladies' spearheading the country's policies and said she 'wants to make the rest of the country miserable too.' Yet, he has only now recanted his remarks, claiming they were satirical. As reported by NBC News, he revealed on The Megyn Kelly Show, \"Obviously, it was a sarcastic comment. I’ve got nothing against cats\" and then blamed the media for \"focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance of what I actually said.\" Apart from this, Mary's letter was mostly aligned with the new 'weird' trend the Democrats are seen following nowadays. As highlighted by HuffPost, as the 100-day countdown to the election approaches, surrogates for Vice President Harris—now the party's presumed presidential nominee—have emphasized the 'weird' point. Nominee Donald Trump, a former president, was characterized by the Harris campaign as 'old and quite weird' in last week's press release. His running partner, Senator Vance, was characterized as 'weird' and 'a creep' in an additional press release.","summary":"Republicans were panned by Donald Trump&#39;s niece, who gave a laundry list of reasons why Republicans &#39;are weird.&#39;","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/why-mary-trump-thinks-that-deeply-weird-trump-needs-to-be-mocked-mercilessly","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/708117/uploads/d7a71610-4e70-11ef-917f-8b2f284a5630_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-31 22:45:00","author":"INQUISITR,Priyanka Pandey","authors":["INQUISITR","Priyanka Pandey"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.321},{"id":253096358,"title":"Deaths of Hamas, Hezbollah Leaders Heighten Tensions in Middle East","text":"The deaths of two of Israel’s top enemies within hours of each other have drastically raised tensions in the region, prompting concerns of escalation. Fuad Shukr, top military leader in Hezbollah, was killed in a fighter strike on a building Beirut’s Hezbollah-dominated southern suburbs on the evening of July 30. The Israel Defense Force (IDF) confirmed his death and took responsibility for the hit. Hamas’ leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed early the next morning. He was in Iran for the inauguration of Iran’s new president, and the house where he was staying was hit from the air, Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard said. A bodyguard was also killed. Israel has not claimed credit for the attack and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government said it won’t comment. Tensions in the fraught region rose even higher over the weekend. A Hezbollah missile struck a soccer field in a Druze village in the Golan Heights on July 27, killing 12 children and teens and wounding more than 40 others. Israel conducted more typical retaliatory air strikes on Hezbollah targets over the weekend, as Netanyahu returned from the United States after speaking to Congress and meeting with President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump. Late on July 28, his cabinet authorized him and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to decide Israel’s manner of retaliation and its timing. Hamas and Hezbollah are both client groups of Iran, which has substantially armed and trained both. Hezbollah, a Shi‘a Muslim group aligned religiously with Iran’s Shi’a theocracy, controls south Lebanon and is regarded as stronger militarily than the nation’s army. Iran’s supreme leader Ali Khamenei vowed revenge against Israel, saying it was “Tehran’s duty.” Hamas is expected to name Khaled Meshaal, 68, who has been the leader of the group in exile before, to replace Haniyeh. Israel tried but failed to assassinate him in 1997. John Kirby, White House national security communications adviser, said that there are “no signs that an escalation is imminent” in the aftermath of Haniyeh’s death. However, he said that the Biden administration is concerned about an escalation. The IDF’s chief of staff suggested Israel wasn’t done responding yet. More than 80,000 Israelis have been forced from their homes under the heat of Hezbollah’s rocket attacks. The group has more than 100,000 missiles in its stockpile. Netanyahu’s government faces domestic pressure to neutralize Hezbollah, which is sworn to Israel’s destruction, so that those citizens can return home. Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi visited IDF troops on the northern front with Lebanon on July 31. “Our intention with Hezbollah is not to return to October 6th,” Halevi told the troops. “Muhsan [Shukr] will not be there, but we will also not let the situation return to having [Hezbollah] present on the border, 200 meters from Metula, or from Shtula, or from Rosh HaNikra.” Halevi alluded to the strike against Shukr. He hinted at retaliation against Nasrallah himself, who has lived underground for years, and he hinted at a possible ground war. “The IDF knows how to operate and reach a certain window in a neighborhood in Beirut. It knows as well how to target a certain point underground. And we also know how to operate inside on the ground very strongly, and this week you are training for this, and this is a very important capability,” he said. The United States has tried to prevent a wider war. It had pressed Israel not to strike Beirut or the Hezbollah stronghold outside it, Dahieh. Israel did exactly that in its killing of Shukr. U.S. criticism of Israel on July 31 was muted. America had put a price of $5 million on Shukr’s head for his involvement in the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing that killed 241 U.S. Marines. All sides feel pressured to respond, Israel military analyst Elliot Chodoff told The Epoch Times. Iran might respond with another massive rocket attack, like that in April, or it might take its time. It could hit Israeli or Jewish targets abroad. It no longer needs to wait for a provocation, because it’s already got one, he said. He opined that the two attacks, assuming Israel was indeed responsible for the Tehran attack, happened together out of coincidence. He thought it was unlikely that they could have been planned well in advance like that. Israel had told Qatar—where Haniyeh lived and which has hosted and mediated talks toward a Gaza cease-fire—that it would not attack Hamas leaders there. Haniyeh spent time in Turkey and Egypt, and Israel wanted to avoid worsening relations with either of them, Chodoff said. Iran, on the other hand, is sworn to Israel’s destruction, so Israel may have seen it as a prime place for the strike, he said. Among Israel’s pressures to act are the grind of the war of attrition, Chodoff said, which both Hamas and Hezbollah are pursuing against it. The war, dragging on for more than nine months, has strained Israel’s military and economy. A failure by Israel to neutralize Hezbollah means the war of attrition goes on, he said. The terror groups face their own pressures. Both have lost much of their top leadership. The IDF said a few weeks ago that it had eliminated half of Hamas’ leaders. Its top leader still in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, is in hiding underground and only in sporadic communication with his remaining forces, Chodoff said. Israel’s military is preparing for a multifront war should Iran’s response come that way, Eli Sperling, a Middle East specialist at the University of Georgia, told The Epoch Times. Iran might coordinate an attack with Hezbollah and with Yemen’s Houthi rebels, also Iranian clients, he said. Chodoff said that Shukr was the last of a group who took control of Hezbollah’s operations in 2008 after a joint Israeli-U.S. attack eliminated a previous leader. Others of that group have already been eliminated. Chodoff said it was an overstatement to hold Shukr directly responsible for the soccer field attack. Those who fired the missile were much lower down, he said. But Shukr was much further up the chain and responsible for the missile’s acquisition. Sperling noted that Iran’s April missile attack, retaliation for an Israeli strike against a high-ranking Iranian in Damascus, was in some ways restrained. Iran gave clear warning it was coming. Many missiles didn’t reach Israel or strike populated areas, and the United States and Arab allies aided Israel in missile defense in an effort to avoid escalation. This time, Sperling said, Iran might strike harder. The attack on Haniyeh—on Iranian soil, when he was a guest in the country—was much more humiliating. Sperling said reports indicated that the missile used was apparently an advanced munition and very precise, entering a window and taking out Haniyeh and a bodyguard but not significantly damaging the building beyond that.","summary":"Israel has taken responsibility for killing Hezbollah's Fuad Shukr in Beirut, but not for a precise missile strike killing Hamas' Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/death-of-hamas-hezbollah-leaders-heightens-tensions-in-middle-east-5697505","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/07/31/id5697111-Hamas-leader-Ismail-Haniyeh-SB_1-SB-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-31 22:43:36","author":"Dan M.

He put his hand on his heart in thanks, looked down and, for the briefest of moments, took it all in. The ovation on Monday was most certainly not for the stated topic of his speech but for what had come before — Biden’s decision to step aside in the 2024 race and throw his support behind his vice president. Not to say it’s been easy for him. Ten days since ending his reelection campaign, Biden still is coming to terms with the political whiplash that he — and the country — have experienced. Privately, the Democratic president is smarting over those who orchestrated the abrupt end of his 50-year political career and processing a mixture of emotions — bitterness and regret among them, but also relief at not having to run a grueling race against Republican Donald Trump. Nor will Biden have to confront the risk of what his potential loss might have done do his legacy and the country. At the same time, the Democratic Party’s swift embrace of Vice President Kamala Harris as Biden’s replacement has sparked pride in the quick consolidation of the party at his encouragement — and also served as an unwelcome reminder of his soon-to-be political irrelevance. Biden, to use a turn of phrase that Harris popularized, is struggling to make sense of what will no longer be, burdened by how his political future has ended. This story is based off interviews with eight longtime Biden aides and allies, many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations. Biden never wanted to step aside. He was shoved slowly toward the door by an ever-growing chorus of Democrats. In the end, he willingly put aside personal ambition, and did so for the unity of the party. It was received as a stunning act of selflessness and he’s been widely praised. But that doesn’t mean he’s at peace with it. “President Biden has goodwill for everyone involved, whatever their opinions were — and a deep appreciation for the values that we share,” said White House spokesman Andrew Bates in a statement. In the days since sending his fateful tweet bowing out of the race and delivering his Oval Office address on the matter, the president has kept a lower profile. Reminders of his diminishing relevance have been manifest in both subtle and obvious ways. The stepped-up travel schedule that Biden had embarked upon to attempt to salvage his campaign after his devastating debate with Trump is no more. Replacing it are policy briefings — often behind closed doors — meant to show Biden is still working through his lame duck era. Biden has told aides he intends to run through the tape on his term in office and has tasked them with finding additional actions he can take before Jan. 20, 2025, to secure his legacy. But what those actions might be remains a work in progress. Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre acknowledged that Biden and the White House are still “recalibrating” after his decision. “We are trying to figure out what the next six months are going to look like,” she said. “Just give us a beat.” Even the president’s regular lunches with Harris on Wednesdays have taken on a new dimension, as the balance of power in their relationship has shifted. Harris, days away from being the official Democratic nominee in her own right, has taken on a more visible role while Biden has stepped back. On Tuesday, she spoke from the tarmac in Atlanta on Israel’s apparent assassination of a top Hezbollah militant before the White House had released a statement. The enthusiasm for Harris already has far exceeded what Biden could generate for this campaign. Thousands turned out for a raucous rally for the vice president in Georgia on Tuesday night. Roughly 8 in 10 Democrats say they would be somewhat or very satisfied if Harris became the Democratic nominee for president, according to a new survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. No longer will Biden deliver the marquee address on the closing night of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Instead, he’s expected to speak on the lower-rated first night. One plan under discussion is for him to watch from the arena stands as Harris formally accepts the party’s nomination that Thursday. Should Harris win — and Biden knows that how history will view him depends in part on how she performs against Trump — the satisfaction of selecting and positioning his vice president for victory and ensuring a graceful end for his time in public service may well win out. Biden aides and allies insist that he’s happy with how his former campaign rallied to support Harris after he handed her the keys and with how Democrats — even those who abandoned him — rushed to embrace her. But at the same time, he’s had little patience for the paeans from those who pushed for him to exit and now praise his decision to step aside, aides and allies said. And he has had difficulty containing the “what-ifs” — he’ll never know for sure if he could have pulled out one last victory. “President Biden appreciates the work of all of the members of the diverse coalition that is dedicated to defeating Donald Trump and the threat he poses to democracy,” said Biden personal spokesman TJ Ducklo. “He is focused on building as much support as possible for Vice President Harris and is pleased with the clear enthusiasm she has received so far.” Outwardly, Biden has tried to remain magnanimous. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, the first Democratic lawmaker to call for Biden to step aside, was invited to welcome the president on the tarmac in Austin on Monday and he described a cordial conversation with Biden to reporters. “I think he made a great sacrifice,” Doggett told KVUE in Austin as he recounted their conversation. “And the country will be the better off for it. And Biden responded, ‘Thank you for calling for my doing this.’” Still, Biden aides have expressed some worry to one another about how his lingering frustrations might surface. Some pointed to his comments in the early hours of Tuesday morning, when a reporter asked Biden about his legacy with regard to LGBTQ Americans. The president harked back to to his 2011 comments supporting same-sex marriage that caught then-President Barack Obama off guard. It came off as a subtle dig at the former president, who in recent weeks was among those working behind the scenes to push Biden toward the exits. “Well, I’m really proud of my position,” Biden said. “I was the first guy to come out for gay marriage. Remember that little problem with the Obama administration?” ___ Long reported from Austin, Texas.

The incident took place in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City, where 45-year-old Harry Heymann attempted to dismantle the devices on two Secret Service vehicles as Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff’s daughter had lunch at Bubby’s, a nearby restaurant. Video obtained by TMZ and later shared by AP News showed Emhoff being ushered into a black SUV and a man being led away in handcuffs. Heymann, reportedly a member of an activist group in New York City that combats devices that obscure license plates from toll and traffic cameras, was attempting to remove an illegal license plate cover from two Secret Service vehicles, per transit newspaper Streetsblog. He was reportedly unaware that the cars belonged to the Secret Service. “On Tuesday afternoon, an individual approached two United States Secret Service vehicles parked in lower Manhattan and, without provocation, caused damage to the rear license plate area of both,” USSS spokesperson James Byrne said in a statement, per CNN. Heymann has previously been vocal about his opposition to plate obscuring maneuvers, tweeting earlier this month about the NYPD’s lack of action on so-called “ghost cars.” Emhoff, who previously dipped her toe into the race to blast vice presidential nominee JD Vance for referring to her stepmother as a “childless cat lady,” was not harmed during the incident. The arrest comes amid turmoil inside the Secret Service, after a failed assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump earlier this month sparked a siege from Congressional Republicans against the department, resulting in the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle.","summary":"Ella Emhoff was unharmed after a man tampered with two Secret Service vehicles, leading to his arrest","url":"https://www.salon.com/2024/07/31/secret-apprehends-individual-after-security-incident-involving-harris-stepdaughter/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2024/07/ella-emhoff-1472158905jpg.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-31 22:35:21","author":"Griffin Eckstein","authors":["Griffin Eckstein"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":253095644,"title":"Black Reporters at NABJ Aim to Keep Trump Responsible, Turns Out as Predicted","text":"The first unforced error: The panel started 35 minutes late because NABJ had some form of equipment failure. Let that sink in: a convention full of journalists and technicians who do this type of stuff in their sleep, was unable to get things working properly for a pivotal conversation with the former president and leading candidate for president in 2024. Highly suspect, and even more unprofessional. The panelists took the stage, and ABC’s Rachel Scott quickly gave an introduction, then introduced Trump, who took the stage and shook her hand before sitting down. You could tell he was clearly on his guard. His hackles rose even more after the openly hostile diatribe and baited question by Scott. WATCH: Donald Trump gives a perfect response to the openly hostile ABC reporters at the #NABJ “I don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner.”pic.twitter.com/LauXGPLcBg — MRC NewsBusters (@newsbusters) July 31, 2024 A lot of people did not think it was appropriate for you to be here today. You have pushed false claims about some of your rivals, from Nikki Haley to former president Barack Obama saying that they were not born in the United States, which is not true. You have told four Congress women of color who were American citizens to go back to where they came from. You have used words like “Animal” and “rabid” to describe Black district attorneys, you’ve attacked Black journalists calling them a loser, saying the questions that they asked are “both stupid and racist.” You’ve had dinner with a white supremacist at your Mar-a-Lago resort. So, my question sir, now that you are asking Black supporters to vote for you. Why should Black voters trust you after you have used language like that? TRUMP: First of all, I don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner, a first question. You don’t even say, “Hello,” “How are you?” Are you with ABC? Because I think they are a fake news network, a terrible network. And I think it’s disgraceful that I came here in good spirit. I love the Black population of this country, I’ve done so much for the Black population of this country. Including employment, including opportunity zones with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, which is one of the greatest programs ever for Black workers and Black entrepreneurs. I’ve done so much, and you know I say this: historically Black colleges and universities were out of money, they were stone-cold broke, and I saved them, and I gave them long-term financing, and nobody else was doing it. I think it’s a very rude introduction. I don’t know exactly why you would do something like that. And let me go a step further, I was invited here, and I was told my opponent—whether it was Biden or Kamala—I was told my opponent was going to be here. It turned out my opponent isn’t here. You invited me under false pretense. Once again, Trump called them out on their duplicity. If it was truly about “opportunities like these both to inform our reporting but also to help voters understand the choices that they face in a consequential and historic election year,” as Scott introduced at the top of the panel, then why wasn’t Vice President Kamala Harris present to do that as well? It seems what the organizers really wanted were “gotcha” moments that worked into their narrative. They got more than that, and in spades. Trump continued: TRUMP: Then you said you can’t do it with Zoom. Well, where’s Zoom? She’s [Harris] going to do it with Zoom, and she’s not coming. Then you were a half an hour late. Just so you understand, I have too respect for you to be late. They couldn’t get their equipment working or something was wrong. R SCOTT: Mr. President I would love for you to answer the question… TRUMP: I have been the best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln. That’s my answer. R SCOTT: Better than President Johnson who signed the Voting Rights Act? TRUMP: That’s my answer. And for you to start off a question and answer period, especially when you’re 35 minutes late, because you couldn’t get your equipment to work, in such a hostile manner, I think it’s a disgrace. I am not sure what Scott expected, but it certainly wasn’t to be shut down, and she was. And leave it to a Democrat apparatchik to invoke Lyndon Baines Johnson, one of the most racist presidents in history, second only to Woodrow Wilson. While Johnson claims the Voting Rights Act, it was overwhelming Republican support that allowed it to be passed into law. So, Scott is either not much of a journalist or not very bright, to bypass these factors. Had Scott done some research, and was really serious, she would not have tried to lead with this question. Sadly, Scott wasn’t content and wanted to exact her pound of flesh. She asked another gotcha question that had to do with policing Trump’s (and Republicans’) language on VP Kamala Harris being a DEI hire. What Scott ended up doing was leaving it wide open for Trump to make the case that Harris is not just a DEI hire, but a manufactured fraud. R SCOTT: Let me just ask a follow-up sir, then we’ll move on to other questions here. Some of your own supporters, including Republicans on Capitol Hill have labeled Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the first Black and Asian woman to serve as Vice President and be on a major party ticket, as a DEI hire. Is that acceptable language to you? And will you tell those Republicans and those supporters to stop it? The only thing missing was Scott wagging her finger in his face. Trump countered. R SCOTT: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion? TRUMP: Is that your definition? Give me a definition. SCOTT: Those are the words for, “DEI,” Sir. I’m asking you a question, I’ve defined it for you. Do you believe VP Kamala Harris is only on the ticket because she is a Black woman? The response was actually quite epic. TRUMP: Well, I can say, maybe it’s a little bit different. I’ve known her for a long time indirectly, not directly so much. She was always of Indian heritage and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn, “Black,” and now she wants to be known as Black. So, I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black? SCOTT: She’s always identified as a Black woman. That is a bald-faced lie that I am sure Politifact will bypass. Up until around 2020, Harris has done nothing but lean in to her “Indian-American” heritage: Kamala only became black when it became politically expedient. She was sworn in as an Indian #NABJ #NABJ24 pic.twitter.com/4EXWFtXOzU — Melissa Tate (@TheRightMelissa) July 31, 2024 This is the disgrace of a “journalist” @rachelvscott ?? How much do they pay you to sellout your country for their LIES? Nasty woman, totally unprofessional and immoral #NABJ https://t.co/jKrBEVw5Md — Liz ✌? (@Buppy9999) July 31, 2024 TRUMP: You know what? I respect either one, I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t. Because she was Indian all the way, and all of a sudden she made a turn and she became a Black person. And I think someone should look into that too, when you ask and continue in a very hostile, nasty tone. SCOTT: It’s a direct question, sir, do you believe that Vice President Kamala Harris is a DEI hire? TRUMP: I really don’t know. I mean, I really don’t know. Could be, could be. There are some. Trump showed he had had quite enough of Scott by pivoting to Harris Faulkner, who, no matter what station she works for, is a seasoned journalist who knows not to ask baited questions. Trump complimented Faulkner, calling her “a fantastic person.” Faulkner had actually interviewed him on July 13, before the attempted assassination. So, Faulkner gets credit for not only bringing that subject back into the forefront, but also asking questions that were prescient to policy and to the actual campaign. HARRIS F: I want to talk about why you’re here today. It is not lost on us how divided we are as a country. As you were coming today, we really got to see that we were divided along the lines of race, along the lines of gender. There is this question of, in this moment where we are, why come here? What is your message today? TRUMP: My message is to stop people from invading our country that are taking, frankly, a lot of problems with it, but one of the big problems, and a lot of the journalists in this room I know and have great respect for, a lot of the journalist in this room are Black. I will tell you, that coming from the Border are millions and millions of people who happen to be taking Black jobs. You had the best— Partisan hack Rachel Scott embarrassed herself further by interjecting, “What exactly is a Black job, sir?” TRUMP: A Black job is anybody that has a job, that’s what it is, anybody who has a job. They are taking the employment away from Black people. Another unforced error by Scott, because it not only allowed Trump to discuss the horrible situation at the Southern border but to anchor it to Vice President Kamala Harris. The legacy media has spent the past week trying to rewrite and scrub any mention of this from her history, and with one stupid question, Scott brought it all back. TRUMP: The first group of people, the Black population is affected most by that, and Kamala is allowing it to happen. She’s the Border Czar, she’s the worst Border Czar in the history of the world, there’s never been a Border Czar like this. She’s never even, essentially, she says she’s been there once, but not the right part of the border. These people are coming into our country and taking Black jobs, and Hispanic jobs, and frankly, their taking Union jobs. Unions are being very badly affected by all the millions of people pouring into our country. And one thing Harris, as we discussed, many of these people are coming in from mental institutions, from prisons, from jails, they’re gang members, and other countries. Other countries are setting loose their prisoners, they’re opening up their prisons and their mental institutions and they’re taking their bad people: drug dealers, gang members, and they’re bringing them into the United States. And by the way, their crime rate is going down, and our crime rate is going to be a disaster. So, the Black journalists may not have been happy with Trump’s answers, but Black voters were affirmed on two points that the Biden-Harris administration and the Democrats wish to ignore: Kamala Harris is the Border Czar, and an ineffective, fake Black woman, and this influx on the Border is costing employment as well as safety for Black Americans in particular, and all Americans in general. Faulkner asked another layered, yet thoughtful question about policy, not personality. HARRIS F: I want to get into how you address some of the issues in Black communities. And I say that plural, because we live in “Communities of Color” that are different. We’re not all the same, we don’t vote the same, we don’t think the same, it’s not all monolithic. Faulkner talked about the rising credit debt and laid out statistics, as well as the toll inflation is having on the Black community. She asked, “What’s your plan for the Black community when it comes to money?” TRUMP: The inflation is absolutely destroying our middle class, our working class, virtually every class. Inflation is a disaster in our country. Inflation is a country buster, it breaks every country. And we had, in my opinion, the worst inflation we’ve ever had—they say it’s 58 years but I think it’s much more than that—it’s been devastating. And if you just take a look at a lot of the things they don’t include. Like interest rates. Interest rates went from 2.4 percent to 10 percent and you can’t get the money. People can’t buy houses. They no longer have the American Dream. Young people, young Black people, they don’t have the American Dream anymore. They can’t buy a house, they can’t borrow the money because of the cost of the money. They can’t buy it because of the cost of housing, because of the cost to build it, because of inflation. Inflation is a disaster and it’s destroying our country and it’s destroying the Black community, probably as much or more than anything else. Here was another win for the Trump campaign. What may seem like a long and rambling response is actually him acknowledging that there is indeed a problem. As opposed to months and years of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellin, the useless Press Secretary Karine-Jean Pierre, President Joe Biden, and VP Kamala Harris gaslighting Americans that there is no problem and it’s all in their heads. HARRIS F: What’s your plan? TRUMP: You know what we have to do, we have to bring down cost of energy, and that’s going to bring down the cost of inflation. This was all started by a bad energy policy by Joe Biden. This created another opening for Trump–to be able to discuss the bloodless coup of Biden being forced out of the campaign for 2024 and being conveniently replaced by Harris. Trump pointed out that their campaign was prepared to tackle one opponent, and then had to quickly shift to tackle another. TRUMP: Ultimately it’s the same, because they have bad policy. They have policies of open borders, unbelievable open borders, horrible energy policies. This gave Trump another chance to discuss ALL the bad policies of the Biden-Harris administration without rebuttal. He then brought it back to the effect of inflation on the Black community. TRUMP: The inflation is the thing that’s hurting the Black worker, the Black population, and every other population within our country. Inflation is the worst its been, I think in over a hundred years. Semafor’s Kadia Goba finally got a chance to ask her question about police immunity. But as is typical of legacy press, the phrasing of her question did not allow for any cogent discussion on why the policy exists and why good police need some form of protection in order to do their job effectively. The rest went as expected. A few cogent, but mostly ridiculous questions surrounding Trump’s VP pick JD Vance. Ever since the Left has been fixated on Vance’s past comments about families, childless women, and cat ladies, certain loud voices on the Right have been trying to force a referendum on the viability of the VP candidate and whether he is dragging down the ticket. Scott again poured milk on stupid and gulped it down, asking, ” Did you know he had these views?” The RNC spends millions of dollars and countless hours digging into candidates’ past, but yeah, Rachel, Trump was not aware of his views. insert *eyeroll* emoji Faulkner asked the question that got an answer that is a reflection of what Trump deems important not only in a VP candidate, but what elicits respect and admiration from him as a person. Faulkner interjected, “Why did you choose him?” Trump gave a full-throated, 10-toes down response.

He is at the top of the ticket, so who people are voting for is him and him alone. Ultimately, the Black men and women who are leaning in his direction are fine with Trump being Trump, and that’s exactly who he was at the NABJ. Trump is winning Black voters by being himself. He went into a hostile room and acted like himself. The effect is negligible. The WORK is with the culture. The media will follow… — Sonnie Johnson (@SonnieJohnson) July 31, 2024 What Black voters received were answers to the concerns they have been expressing for three years, and some policy prescriptions that might give them some relief. That’s infinitely more than a show with Megan Thee Stallion twerking, and feel-good bromides over the first “Black” female candidate.

That’s the only path to 270.” Although he acknowledges Kamala’s current momentum, he believes higher-ups in the Democrat Party are pessimistic about her ability to win undecided voters. “Democrats who know her in full all have said she’s a weaker candidate than Joe Biden in that regard. And that’s because they’ve seen what the rest of the nation is going to see in the next three months: that at her core, she is a lifelong woman of the left who has not proven herself capable of dealing with the difficult problems of the world.” Castellanos, a Cuban-born political consultant who grew up in North Carolina, has seen it all. He’s worked with GOP presidential candidates from Bob Dole to Mitt Romney, shaping modern campaign strategy along the way. The “father of the attack ad,” as he’s called among politicos, is also well known for his contributions to the lexicon of American political vernacular. In 1996, Castellanos popularized the term “soccer mom,” now a well known archetype of American life inspired by his own wife, who he says is the original. “Yep, guilty. I happen to have married her. My wife was in the suburban assault vehicle, taking the kids to school, managing the household business, taking care of the parents on one end, kids on the other,” he told The Post. “And I made the comment one day to E.J. Dionne [of The Washington Post] that she’s the voter that both campaigns are targeting. She’s the soccer mom. And next thing I know, it’s on bumper stickers.” These days Castellanos works as a bipartisan political consultant in Virginia, and he says the “soccer moms” of this election cycle are blue collar workers in the Rust Belt, who Harris needs to win. To capture the “blue wall” states – Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania – Harris may need to take a page out of her predecessor’s book, Castellano said. “[She] has got to have some of that working-class appeal that Joe Biden has: the way he goes back home to Delaware on the train, that he’s one of us, that he understands our problems.” Here’s the latest on Kamala Harris’ 2024 presidential campaign: Kamala Harris launches first ad showing Trump mug shot Trump campaign not convinced Kamala Harris will be Democratic nominee – won’t finalize debate until she is Kamala Harris’ Silicon Valley allies set to raise $100M as they pitch wealthy donors: report Kamala Harris manager says 2024 race will be ‘hard fought’ and won in ‘battlegrounds’ Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker clarifies if he’s being vetted as Kamala Harris’ running mate That does not mean, however, that she should solicit help from President Biden, Castellanos emphasized. What should the current president do, you ask, for Kamala’s campaign? “Never get on the campaign bus,” Castellanos warned. “Just stay in the basement.” Still, transforming her image will be a tough task for Harris, who has failed to impress voters as VP, and has only a limited number of months to turn things around before November. “That’s a bigger reach for her because she’s got a history of fairly radical liberalism on the internet,” said Castellanos. “She has to appeal to the blue-collar Macomb County working class. She’s got to become something she has not been and believe everything she has rejected.” Kamala’s best chance to win the election? Appear more right-wing, says this mustachioed political veteran. “To have a shot at carrying Michigan and Pennsylvania and North Carolina and even Virginia, she has to offer a more centrist agenda. So I think a lot of Democrats will let Kamala move to the right, to the point where she could put a Trump bumper sticker on her campaign limo and get away with it.” If she does shift, it wouldn’t defy Democrat campaign history. “Bill Clinton ran as a Democrat who was for welfare reform and supported the death penalty. And when Carville was asked, ‘How did you do that?’ How did you rally the Democratic Party behind that?’ he said, ‘Well, we was sick of losing!’” “She’s caught between a rock and a hard place,” Castellanos said of Harris, “because if she doesn’t offer a more centrist policy agenda, she’s an out-of-touch liberal responsible for illegal immigration, crime, inflation, and, and wars all over the world.” “And if she does change her position on those things, she is a political chameleon and inauthentic,” he added. “So can she pivot on a dime? Can she become something she’s not?” Castellanos says putting on her “crime-fighting cape” and running on her record as a prosecutor to win over undecided voters is one potentially viable strategy. “I think her campaign believes that the ‘tough prosecutor’ is the only thing she has,” said Castellanos. The best thing that Kamala can do in the immediate future, he says, is to pick a macho, centrist VP candidate who balances her out in the eyes of the public. “I think she needs someone that makes her lefty radicalism and her lack of seriousness safer. In other words, I think she needs some toxic masculinity. I think she needs a centrist Democrat. I think she needs someone like Mark Kelly from Arizona.” Looking to the weeks ahead, the politico predicts a short honeymoon period for Harris, who is riding high on her post-announcement momentum. “She’ll get another bump at her convention with a good vice-presidential pick and two Obama speeches at the convention.” Still, Castellanos says her documented history of hard-left talking points will break her stride. Finally, the “father of the attack ad” concluded with one well-considered observation. “Without anyone ever running a negative commercial against Kamala Harris the past four years, she has still become the most unpopular vice president in American history.”","summary":"Veteran political strategist Alex Castellanos sees only one path to victory for Kamala Harris: shedding her image as an elite San Francisco liberal to win over working class Rust Belt voters.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/31/us-news/veteran-political-strategist-alex-castellanos-reveals-kamala-harris-sole-path-to-victory/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-gu7zk3pcm-1722463944904.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1722449601&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/52630CVC-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-31 22:33:23","author":"George Caldwell","authors":["George Caldwell"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.151},{"id":253095642,"title":"Kamala’s High-Caste Brahmin Background and Her Uncle Gopalan as a Top Indian Government Consultant","text":"Last Updated on July 31, 2024 Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris comes from a Brahmin family from India on her mother’s side. The Brahmins are the highest caste in India’s Hindu system, reviled by many for their sense of racial superiority and the associated benefits they enjoy in Indian life. Kamala Harris’ uncle is listed as a top consultant to the government of India, and has worked for a group funded by India’s military. So what is Harris’ uncle’s expertise? He is an expert on nuclear weapons. Kamala’s uncle’s work for the Indian government could be considered a NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT to the United States of America. Her family’s roots undermine her cynical portrayal of herself as an exemplar of the African-American experience. Kamala Harris’ uncle Gopalan Balachandran is listed by the Journal of Defense Management as “a Consulting Fellow at the IDSA,” though the press has recently referred to him as a “former” consultant for the IDSA. The IDSA stands for “Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses” (IDSA), which is a think tank in New Delhi that is funded by the Indian Ministry of Defence. China’s ambassador to India held a meeting at IDSA in New Delhi in June of this year to urgently discuss India-China relations. Balachandran’s 2013 archived IDSA bio lists him as a “Consulting Fellow at the IDSA.” The investigative blog Mining Awareness reported that Balachandran wrote for the IDSA as recently as 2019 and informally advised the think tank as recently as 2020. Uncle Gopalan’s Journal of Defense Management bio also lists another example of direct employment by the Indian government, stating, “He is a Consultant both to the Americas Division of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs and to the Confederation of Indian Industry.” Uncle Gopalan has been active in the press on Kamala’s behalf, even talking to CNN on the phone. Here is Uncle Gopalan on behalf of IDSA discussing the “Current Negotiations on the Iranian Nuclear Issue” in 2013, which included Gopalan crediting Iran with making a positive action in at least one instance: The New Yorker reported: “Harris’s mother, Shyamala Gopalan, the Brahman daughter of a diplomat from Chennai, graduated from the University of Delhi at nineteen, and, avoiding an arranged marriage, went to Berkeley to study nutrition and endocrinology. There, she met another graduate student, Donald Harris, from Jamaica, who was pursuing a Ph.D. in economics. The student civil-rights movement, centered on the Berkeley campus, gave the two young immigrants a shared context. “They both identified as people of color and people who were oppressed by a white-male-dominated world,” Meena Harris, Kamala’s niece, told me. “Their fields were science and economics—there were not many Indian women or black men.” They were married while still in graduate school, and Kamala was born in 1964; another daughter, Maya, came two years after that…Hindu customs and cosmology infused their lives. The name Kamala means lotus, and is another name for the goddess Lakshmi.” New Yorker passage ends Harris was happy to acknowledge herself as the first potential Indian member of the United States Senate, back when she was running for Senate in California and 2016 and doing a Democrat convention interview with a network that caters to an Indian audience. India’s infatuation with Harris rn is a perfect example of how significant a role caste still plays within the Indian minset, and that the progressive kids equally perpetuate and retain it also cause most of them come from upper class backgrounds.

Al Sharpton said Donald Trump accomplished what he set out to do by appearing at the National Association of Black Journalists conference in Chicago on Wednesday. The former president’s goal, according to Sharpton, was not to reach a new audience—but to show his majority-white base that he’s still on their side. “He went in there and stood up to those Black journalists, stood up and called the vice president someone that is not proud of who she is,” Sharpton told MSNBC’s Nicole Wallace shortly after Trump’s widely panned interview. “Played to those few Black men that he’s trying to get off.” The longtime civil rights leader and Democratic Party activist said the former president used the audience of Black journalists primarily as a “backboard” to score points with his own fan base. “I will go to their own conference and do everything but call them the n-word,” Sharpton said, imagining Trump’s thought process. “And I will try to act like their candidate, their hero, their strong black woman they’re rallying around—she didn’t even say she was black until a little while ago.” At the conference, Trump raised eyebrows when he said Vice President Kamala Harris “happened to turn Black” after previously identifying with her mother’s Indian heritage. “I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t,” Trump told ABC News’ Rachel Scott. “She was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she became a Black person.” Harris’ mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was an immigrant from India. Her father, Stanford University economics professor emeritus Donald J. Harris, is a Black immigrant originally from Jamaica. Harris attended Howard University, a prominent HBCU in Washington, D.C. Sharpton had harsh words for Trump’s critique, asking the Republican candidate, “when did we not know she was Black? When she was elected the first Black district attorney of San Francisco? Or maybe when she was elected the first Black attorney general of the state of California? Or maybe we missed it when she was the only Black woman in the U.S. Senate? Or the only Black woman to run for vice president?” Trump, for his part, doubled down on the criticism of Harris after the interview—reposting a video on Truth Social where Harris cooks Indian food with actor Mindy Kaling. Sharpton also accused the former president of having “a serious problem with blacks, period. Particularly black women,” later adding that he “saw the NABJ as a useful platform for him to show that he will stand up to blacks, and call us whatever he wants to call us, and attack our people in our face. And they aren’t gonna do anything about it.”","summary":"Scott Olson/Getty ImagesRev.
