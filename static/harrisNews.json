These events feel so far away now, when we read them from within the frequent shocks of the Trump presidency, from troops on the streets of Washington to the indictment of former FBI director James Comey. But the chapter titles – beginning “July 21. 107 Days to the Election” – remind us the election was just last year. \n\n“It says a lot about how traumatised we both were by what happened that night that Doug and I never discussed it with each other until I sat down to write this book,” Harris reflects about election night: her campaign at an end and Trump triumphant.\n\nThe book is not the whole story – not by a long shot. But her words about these events resonate with a ring of truth.\n\nBook review: 107 Days – Kamala Harris (Simon & Schuster)\n\nThe first chapter, Sunday July 21, covers the day Joe Biden – who disintegrated before our eyes in his catastrophic debate with Trump – withdrew from the race, with no road to victory. \n\nHe did want to endorse Harris, but “not for a day, maybe two”. She told him that would be “ruinous”. She argued that she was not just “the candidate in the strongest position to win”, but “the only person” who would preserve Biden’s legacy. “At this point, anyone else was bound to throw him – and all the good he had achieved – under the bus.”\n\nShe draws on her call notes to supply the reactions of various senior Democrats to the news that day, from Bill Clinton (“Oh my god, I’m so relieved!”) to Gavin Newsom:\n\nHiking. Will call back. (He never did.)\n\nThroughout, Harris is relentlessly sharp in recollecting the campaign – and very candid on all the principals, including the love of her husband, Doug Emhoff. \n\nIt takes courage to write about such an agonising, devastating defeat – after an historic, exhilarating campaign – so quickly and so personally. Memoirs are rarely written this quickly. (We are still waiting, five years later, for the second volume of Barack Obama’s memoirs.)\n\nIn writing this book, she got by with a little help from a “special friend”: Pulitzer prize winning Australian author Geraldine Brooks. Harris’ acknowledgements note her deep appreciation of working with Brooks, whose “ferocious and brilliant artistic insights were indispensable.” \n\nThe book fully reflects that. And who knows? Brooks one day might collaborate with Kamala on an inaugural address.\n\nCandid, but loyal about Biden\n\nHarris is candid about Biden’s decline, but still essentially loyal. \n\n“On his worst day, he was more deeply knowledgeable, more capable of exercising judgment, and far more compassionate than Donald Trump at his best,” she writes. “There was a distinction between his ability to campaign and his ability to govern.”\n\nBob Woodward, the dean of presidential journalists, reached the same conclusion in his last book, War.\n\nHarris writes:\n\nof all the people in the White House, I was in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out. I knew it would come off to him as incredibly self-serving if I advised him not to run. He would see it as naked ambition.\n\nThe choice, she says, should not “have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.”\n\nIn other words, this was a decision his family and associates did not want to make. But it was imperative the national interest be placed above Biden’s personal interest.\n\nThe Harris campaign kept the core of Team Biden. “I didn’t have time to build a new plane; I had to fly the aircraft available.”\n\nOne of Biden’s closest advisors, Mike Donilon (criticised in Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s recent Biden book, Original Sin) left Harris’ campaign two weeks in. \n\nShe describes him, during Biden’s 2024 campaign, filtering poll data and presenting “the numbers in soothing terms […] really there was nothing to see here”. At these briefings (which “made no sense to me”), she writes, “Doug had wanted to stop sitting next to me because he got tired of me kicking him under the table when I asked a question and got a nonanswer.”\n\nPete Buttigieg ‘too big of a risk’ as VP\n\nHarris delivers the goods on her vice-presidential search. She admits Pete Buttigieg (a personal friend) was her first choice and the “ideal partner” – but the then transportation secretary, with his husband and children, was “too big of a risk” for “a Black woman married to a Jewish man”.\n\nJosh Shapiro, governor of Pennsylvania, came across to her as wanting a co-presidency. “At one point, he mused that he would want to be in the room for every decision […] I had a nagging concern that he would be unable to settle for a role as number two.”\n\nShe viewed senator and retired astronaut Mark Kelly of Arizona very favourably, but was afraid the Trump attack machine would try to take him down on his (excellent) military service record – just like the Republicans did to John Kerry in 2004. The man who led that effort, Chris LaCivita, was now a top Trump campaign aide.\n\nCould a captain, used to deference and respect, adapt to an opponent’s national campaign specifically designed to disrespect him, to cut a hero down to something small?\n\nOf course, the military service slander she feared with Kelly was employed against her eventual choice. Minnesota governor Tim Walz, who served in the National Guard for 24 years, was accused by vice president JD Vance of “stolen valor” for his misstatement, while arguing for an assault weapons ban, that “these weapons of war that I carried in war” had no place on civilian streets, though he didn’t serve in combat.\n\nHarris found the chemistry she wanted with the “genuinely self-deprecating” Walz: an all-American decent guy next door, with great values and common sense. “He had no fixed ideas about what the role of vice president would be, saying he would do whatever I found was most useful for him to do.”\n\nShe writes that her senior staff favoured Walz, “to a person”, as did her sister – while husband Doug Emhoff, interestingly, leaned towards Shapiro.\n\nWe will never know if Shapiro or Kelly would have carried their swing states, perhaps changing the outcome of the election.\n\n‘Don’t ever let them make you cry’\n\nTrump’s outrages on the campaign trail were rife. Harris takes us behind the scenes to reveal her reactions to key moments, like Trump’s infamous statement to the National Association with Black Journalists: “I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black.” (Her mother is Indian; her father Jamaican.) \n\nTo campaign aide Brian Fallon, who wanted her to “punch back with a big speech about my racial identity”, she retorted:\n\nToday he wants me to prove my race. What next? He’ll say I’m not a woman and I’ll need to show my vagina?\n\nHarris takes us into her July 25 meeting with Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu during her campaign. She also tells us she believes Israel was right to respond to “the atrocities of October 7”, but criticises the “ferocity” of Netanyahu’s response, including “the number of innocent Palestinian women and children killed and his failure to prioritize the lives of the hostages”. She was tough. \n\n“I interrupted to reiterate the need for an immediate ceasefire and a day-after plan that gave Palestinians some kind of political horizon.” Netanyahu did not like what he was hearing – especially from her. “He wanted Trump in the seat opposite him. Not Joe. Not me.”\n\nHarris does acknowledge Biden gaffes, like when he put on the MAGA hat of a Trump supporter he was joking with, who offered it to him. Her internal monologue went: “Don’t take it […] Don’t put it on.” Then: “He put it on.” That photo carried the caption, “Biden endorses Trump over Harris.” A bad day on a trail that had only 107 days. \n\nWhen Harris talks about being a woman in politics, she sounds a lot like Julia Gillard. \n\n“As any woman in a public-facing job knows, it takes us longer,” she writes about the two hours she needed to get ready on the campaign trail – make-up, hairstyling, “more complicated apparel choices”. Women are still judged on these seeming trivialities, she writes, over “the consequential matters we’re engaged in”.\n\nShe relates a conversation with German chancellor Angela Merkel. “They used to call me this – this ugly bird. And at first it hurt me deeply.” Angela leant towards Kamala. “Don’t ever let them make you cry.”\n\nHarris never does.\n\n‘I know Donald Trump’s type’\n\nHarris’ speeches hit Trump where it hurts. As California’s attorney general, she told crowds:\n\nI took on predators of all kinds […] Predators who abused women, who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own game. So hear me when I say […] I know Donald Trump’s type.\n\nThe crowds “exploded” at this line, she writes. \n\nThere are phrases in English that do a lot of work for you. “I know his type” is one of them. We’ve all said it about someone of low character whom we’ve personally known.\n\nShe had big rallies. And big money. She was fully competitive.\n\nHarris told America what Day One of President Kamala Harris would look like. “When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list full of priorities on what I will get done for the American people.”\n\nBy contrast: “On day one, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list.” Does anyone following American politics today doubt that?\n\nBy her own account, the wisest advisor in her campaign was David Plouffe, who ran Barack Obama’s successful 2008 campaign. But like a Shakespearean ghost, Plouffe’s warnings haunt this play. He counselled her Trump was doing better than in 2016 and 2020, and the assassination attempt had pushed his turnout up 20%. “Whatever you think his turnout will be, add ten per cent.” \n\nHer campaign strategists were not happy about Harris’ continued praise for Biden in her speeches, urging her to stop. Plouffe put it bluntly: “People hate Joe Biden.” Harris quotes those words twice.\n\nWhy does she believe she lost?\n\nThis is her verdict: “One hundred and seven days were not, in the end, long enough to accomplish the task of winning the presidency.”\n\nTrump got three million more votes in 2024 than he did in 2020. Harris got six million fewer votes than she and Biden did in 2020.\n\nAll that Harris was proud of – the landmark legislation on infrastructure, health care and clean energy – would not deliver their full benefits before the election. In the run up to November, she writes, inflation and interest rates were high, and there was no immediate relief.\n\nHarris wanted to talk directly to Trump supporters, but it never happened. She wrote:\n\nI wished I could ask every one of them. What are you angry about? What about me makes you angry? Is it your health care, your grocery bills, a backbreaking job that doesn’t pay what you’re worth – and what can I do to help you?\n\nShe did not reach them.\n\nShe combated Trump’s strength on immigration and border issues, and the issue of Gen Z facing a future without good prospects. An anti-trans campaign ripped across the country: “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.” It was reported more than US$21 million was spent by Trump and Republicans on anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ television ads as of October 9 2024.\n\nHarris peaked in mid-September. She never had a lead clear of the polls’ margin of error. \n\nOn election day, she believed she would win.","summary":"In her campaign memoir, Kamala Harris reveals her true thoughts on Joe Biden, takes us behind the scenes of her presidential candidacy and dishes the occasional dirt.","url":"https://theconversation.com/kamala-harris-candid-memoir-reveals-her-ideal-vice-president-and-why-she-thinks-she-lost-266047","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/693559/original/file-20250930-56-jz4e2v.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C49%2C3999%2C1999&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-01 00:48:32","author":"Bruce Wolpe,Non-resident Senior Fellow,United States Study Centre,University of Sydney","authors":["Bruce Wolpe","Non-resident Senior Fellow","United States Study Centre","University of Sydney"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.114},{"id":365007268,"title":"Why Bad Bunny’s selection as the Super Bowl halftime headliner is sparking MAGA fury","text":"MAGA influencers are furious with the National Football League – again – after the sports league announced Sunday that Bad Bunny, the superstar Puerto Rican recording artist, would headline its Super Bowl LX halftime show.\n\nThe NFL, which has a bipartisan fan base, has been leery of entering the culture wars since President Donald Trump’s first term, when the league largely capitulated to his demand that it prevent players from kneeling on the sidelines during the national anthem to protest racial inequality and police brutality.\n\nBad Bunny’s critics have zeroed in on his criticism of Trump’s agenda, his exclusively Spanish-language lyrics, his gender-fluid fashion choices and his comments in a recent interview sharing that part of the reason he was not touring his latest album, “Debí Tirar Más Fotos,” in the U.S. mainland was out of concern his concerts would become a target for Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.\n\nThe NFL did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHere’s why Bad Bunny’s planned appearance at the Feb. 8 halftime show in Santa Clara, California, has sparked a conservative backlash:\n\nWho is Bad Bunny and what are his politics?\n\nBad Bunny, whose full name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, is a three-time Grammy winner and one of the most streamed artists in the world. His latest album, “Debí Tirar Más Fotos,” became the first of 2025 to surpass 7 billion Spotify streams on Sunday.\n\nHe is known for proudly representing his home island of Puerto Rico in his music and his public platforms, where he shares the U.S. territory’s culture and the challenges that it faces. (Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens.)\n\n“What I’m feeling goes beyond myself,” Bad Bunny said in a statement announcing his selection. “It’s for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown … this is for my people, my culture, and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”\n\nBad Bunny recently wrapped up a sold-out 31-show concert residency in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which drew hundreds of thousands of fans and is estimated to have generated more than $700 million for the island. Later this year, he will embark on a worldwide stadium tour that will include stops in Mexico, Japan, Australia and France.\n\nThe U.S. mainland was noticeably missing from his list of tour venues.\n\nHe said in a recent interview with i-D magazine that he was worried that U.S. mainland shows would have exposed his Latino fan base to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.\n\n“ICE could be outside. And it’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about,” he said in the interview.\n\nHe was already on shaky ground with Trump’s supporters.\n\nIn 2024, Bad Bunny offered his support for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, sharing a video of her plans for Puerto Rico on his Instagram – just moments after a speaker at Trump’s rally in New York City referred to the U.S. territory as a “floating island of garbage.”\n\nBad Bunny has been vocally critical of Trump. In 2017, hearrived at the Somos Livebenefitconcert, which was held to raise money for disaster relief, weeks after Hurricane Maria, wearing T-shirt that read: “¿Tu eres twitero o presidente?” (“Are you a tweeter or president?”) And he explicitly criticized Trump with vulgarities in a 2020 song.\n\nIn July, he took aim at Trump’s immigration policies in the music video for his song “NUEVAYol,” featuring a voice that sounds like Trump’s apologizing to immigrants.\n\n“I made a mistake,” the voice says. “… I want to say that this country is nothing without the immigrants. This country is nothing without Mexicans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Colombians, Venezuelans, Cubans.”\n\nWhat are MAGA commentators saying?\n\nThe Super Bowl announcement triggered swift criticism from MAGA influencers, including several from the sports world.\n\n“No songs in English should not be allowed at one of America’s highest rated television events of the year,” Danica Patrick, a former professional racing driver and rising conservative pundit, wrote on X.\n\n“Do a little homework and it’s obvious that Bad Bunny is so much worse than most realize. Can you say, DEMONIC??” wrote Sage Steele, a former ESPN anchor and conservative speaker.\n\nTomi Lahren, a conservative commentator, reposted an AI-generated video of Bad Bunny saying he was never performing in the United States again because of ICE concerns and suggested sending Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, to the Super Bowl.\n\nJack Posobiec, another right-wing commentator, suggested that Turning Point USA host a “counter-Superbowl halftime show” with rock band Creed. He blamed “Barack Obama’s best friend” Jay-Z for the selection of Bad Bunny as the headliner. Jay-Z’s company Roc Nation has a partnership with the NFL to produce the halftime show.\n\n“The NFL is self-destructing year after year,” Benny Johnson, a prominent podcaster, wrote on X.\n\nSome prominent Democrats responded to Johnson’s post. “Another MAGA Karen trying to censor popular artists,” wrote Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Arizona).\n\nWhat has Trump said?\n\nTrump has not commented on Bad Bunny’s selection as the Super Bowl headliner, but that could change any minute.\n\nTrump has long had a tumultuous relationship with the NFL, predating his first term as president. As a businessman, Trump tried unsuccessfully on several occasions to become an owner of an NFL team.\n\nDuring his first term as president, Trump demanded that NFL owners fire or suspend players who kneel during the national anthem in protest and urged fans to boycott.\n\nThe league, which has long marketed itself as a bastion of patriotism, eventually created policies to keep protesting players in the locker room during the anthem.\n\nTrump’s relationship with the NFL has seemingly improved. Earlier this year, he became the first sitting U.S. president to attend the Super Bowl. In May, Trump announced that the 2027 NFL Draft will take place on the National Mall in Washington.","summary":"The Puerto Rican recording artist opposed Trump in 2024 and is not offering tour dates in the U.S. mainland to avoid exposing his fans to ICE raids.\n\n\nThe post Why Bad Bunny’s selection as the Super Bowl halftime headliner is sparking MAGA fury appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2025/09/30/why-bad-bunnys-selection-as-the-super-bowl-halftime-headliner-is-sparking-maga-fury/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bunny-68dc66eb7188e-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-30 23:32:03","author":"Washington Post","authors":["Washington Post"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.37},{"id":365003090,"title":"Ariana Grande draws White House ire for resharing Trump critique","text":"Ariana Grande is the latest pop star to provoke a response from Donald Trump’s White House. On Sunday, the singer and actress reshared a post on her Instagram story questioning whether Trump supporters’ lives had actually improved since his return to office, and highlighting the impact of ICE raids, anti-trans rhetoric, and threats to free speech.\n\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Kush Desai responded with a statement peppered with Grande’s song titles (“Save Your Tears,” “Just Like Magic” and “Get Well Soon”): “Save your tears, Ariana. President Trump’s actions ended Joe Biden’s inflation crisis and are bringing in trillions in new investments. He even signed an executive order just like magic that paved the way for the FTC to crack down on Ticketmaster for ripping off Ariana Grande’s concert-going fans. Get well soon, Ariana!” The statement references the FTC’s recent lawsuit against Live Nation and Ticketmaster, which alleges the companies colluded with ticket brokers to circumvent purchase limits, letting scalpers resell tickets at inflated prices for major events, including Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour.\n\nGrande publicly supported Kamala Harris in 2024 and Bernie Sanders in 2020, and previously performed at the White House during the 2014 “Women of Soul” event for President Obama. She joins a roster of celebrities targeted by Trump in 2025: in February, he celebrated online as Taylor Swift was booed at the Super Bowl, and in July, he called for the prosecution of Beyoncé, for supposedly receiving $11 million to endorse Kamala Harris during an October 2024 campaign event. (There is no basis for this claim.) And earlier this month, Trump doubled down on his feud with comedian Rosie O’Donnell and seemingly threatened to sue ABC over its decision to bring back Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show.","summary":"The pop star is the latest addition to Trump’s 2025 celebrity grudge list","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/09/30/ariana-grande-draws-white-house-ire-for-resharing-trump-critique/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/09/ariana-grande-2234307603-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-30 22:27:31","author":"Angelina Mazza","authors":["Angelina Mazza"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.003},{"id":364985848,"title":"Fox News Poll: Democrat Sherrill leads New Jersey governor’s race","text":"A Fox News survey of New Jersey voters finds Democrat Mikie Sherrill ahead of Republican Jack Ciattarelli by 8 percentage points among likely voters (50-42%) and 7 points among the larger sample of registered voters (48-41%) – both lead just outside the margin of sampling error. The candidates are vying for the seat being vacated by term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who beat Ciattarelli in the 2021 gubernatorial election by only about 3 points. FOX NEWS POLL: UNHAPPY WITH NYC'S DIRECTION, VOTERS FAVOR MAMDANI FOR MAYOR BY A WIDE MARGIN This analysis uses registered voter results. Sherrill, a congresswoman, gets her biggest backing from Black and Hispanic voters, those with a college degree, and voters under age 45. There is a 15-point gender gap, as women prefer Sherrill by 14 points and men favor Ciattarelli by 1. Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, does best among MAGA supporters, White Catholics, White men without a college degree, and voters ages 45-54. Nearly equal numbers of Republicans back Ciattarelli (90%) as Democrats go for Sherrill (89%), and the preference among the small subgroup of independents splits. Sherrill is helped by more New Jersey voters identifying as Democrats than Republicans. Both Sherrill and Ciattarelli supporters have a high degree of vote certainty (84% each). Still, the race has room for movement as about one voter in seven says they could change their mind before casting their ballot. FOX NEWS POLL: CAPITALISM REMAINS MORE POPULAR THAN SOCIALISM, YET MAJORITIES SUPPORT TAXING THE WEALTHY By an 8-point margin, a larger share of Ciattarelli supporters (50%) than Sherrill supporters (42%) say they are more enthusiastic about voting this year than usual. The Fox News survey was completed after both the first gubernatorial debate on September 21 and news that the National Personnel Records Center at the National Archives had mistakenly released unredacted portions of Sherrill's military file. That release, reported publicly on September 25, prompted complaints from Sherrill and other Democrats, while the Ciattarelli campaign began pressing her on the issue. By a 6-point margin, more voters have a positive opinion of Sherrill (51%) than of Ciattarelli (45%) and, by a 7-point spread, more think she is honest and trustworthy (56%) than say the same about him (49%). Murphy’s favorable rating is underwater by a single point (47% vs. 48%). While more than half remain dissatisfied with the direction of their state, New Jersey voters are happier now than when Murphy was elected: 46% are satisfied with how things are going, up 9 percentage points from 37% who felt that way in 2017. The New Jersey electorate is concerned about two main issues. In spontaneous, unprompted replies, 34% say taxes are the biggest problem facing the state and 20% say the cost of living. Other issues like housing and energy costs are mentioned by 5% or fewer. Sherrill is preferred by 16 points among those whose priority is the cost of living, while tax voters favor Ciattarelli by 5. Only 4% of voters volunteer President Donald Trump/the Republicans as the biggest problem for the state, but one-third say one reason for their vote is to express opposition to Trump (34%) -- more than double the number who are voting to show him support (16%). Six in 10 Democrats say their vote is to express opposition to Trump compared to 4 in 10 Republicans who say theirs is to show support. More than half of Republicans say Trump is not a factor in their vote (56%). Overall, 42% of NJ voters have a favorable opinion of Trump, while 55% view him unfavorably. That’s a net negative by 13 points, which is an improvement since 2017, when his ratings were underwater by 26 points. While former Vice President Kamala Harris won New Jersey by 6 points (52%), Trump received 46% of the vote in last year’s presidential election, up from the 41% he received in both 2020 and 2016. Poll-pourri A 54% majority of New Jersey voters think the way Republicans talk about politics these days is leading to an increase in violence, while just under half, 48%, say the same about Democrats. Conducted September 25-28, 2025 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,002 New Jersey registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (120) and cellphones (638) or completed the survey online by following a link received via text message (244). There was a subsample of 822 likely voters. Results based on both the registered voter and likely voter sample have a margin of sampling error of ± 3 percentage points. Sampling error for results among subgroups is higher. In addition to sampling error, question wording and order can influence results. Sources for developing weight targets include the most recent American Community Survey, Fox News Voter Analysis, and voter file data. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics of respondents are representative of the registered voter population. Likely voters are identified based on past vote history and self-reported likelihood of voting. Results among subgroups are only shown when the sample size is at least N=100.

Support for Israel is waning among young Americans. A self-avowed socialist is the leading candidate for New York City mayor.\n\nThe Daily Signal’s president and executive editor, Rob Bluey, tackled these topics——plus Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl selection—during CNN’s “NewsNight With Abby Phillip” Monday night.\n\nThe fatal shooting at a Catholic school Mass last month and the deadly attack on a Mormon church this past weekend has left communities shattered.\n\n“We have seen a significant, sharp increase in attacks on Christians and churches,” Bluey said. According to the Family Research Council, there were 383 attacks on Christian churches last year alone. The Daily Signal’s Tyler O’Neil documented nine recent church attacks in 2025.\n\nBluey noted that this problem goes beyond a need for government intervention. The underlying causes of violence against Christians are deeply embedded within our society.\n\n“As people have abandoned religion and faith and the belief in Jesus Christ, we have moved away from some of those very foundational principles that not only were instrumental in the creation of this great country that we live in, but have guided us for thousands of years,” Bluey said.\n\nTrump-Netanyahu Meeting\n\nCNN’s show aired just hours after President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a 20-point plan to bring peace to Gaza.\n\nBluey summarized the deal, noting three key points: a guarantee for Israel’s security, the release of the Israeli hostages, and the rejection of a Palestinian state without meeting specific criteria.\n\nPhillip then pivoted the conversation to support for Israel and Trump’s recent statement, saying of Israel, “They may be winning the war, but they’re not winning the world of public relations.”\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center polling, 53% of U.S. adults have an unfavorable view of Israel. The share of conservatives with an unfavorable view of Israel has jumped from 27% to 37% in the last three years.\n\nBluey noted that topic was a subject of debate at the National Conservativism Conference in Washington, D.C., earlier in September. The Daily Signal’s Bradley Devlin wrote about the generational divide among conservatives on Israel.\n\nTrump’s Threat to Mamdani\n\nOn New York City’s mayoral race, leading candidate Zohran Mamdani is unconcerned with Trump’s warnings that withholding federal funds if Mamdani follows through on his socialist promises.\n\nIn a CNN interview Monday, Mamdani cited California’s legal battles with the Trump administration and its success in those legal challenges as the approach he would embrace as mayor—litigating to fight for federal funding.\n\nBluey said he expects Trump and Mamdani to continue their quarrels through Election Day.\n\n“You‘re going to see more fireworks,” Bluey said. “Mamdani has identified himself as a democratic socialist, or as conservatives would say, a communist. And so why wouldn’t they play up some of the policy proposals and the cost of those, and what it would mean in terms of the implications for the residents of New York City, were he to be elected?”\n\nBad Bunny’s Big News\n\nOn a lighter note, next year’s Super Bowl halftime show will feature Bad Bunny, an artist who endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris during her 2024 presidential campaign and has criticized Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.\n\nBluey said conservatives’ criticism of the NFL should come as no surprise given past missteps by the league. In this case, he hopes people will not continue to politicize the game.\n\n“Let him sing. I’m not going to watch the halftime show anyway,” Bluey said. “There are people who tune in for the Super Bowl just for the entertainment factor. There are others who tune in because they want to watch a good football game between the two best teams in the NFL. That’s probably ultimately how it‘s going to play out.

Washington Convention Center on September 27, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Aaron J. Thornton/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\n“For more than half a century, the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) has not only been the conscience of Congress, but the conscience of America,” Vice President Kamala Harris said.\n\nClad in a deep purple Sergio Hudson gown, Harris delivered those remarks before a crowd of supporters, members of Congress, and admirers who gave her a hometown hero’s welcome as she received the Phoenix Award, one of the CBC Foundation’s most coveted honors.\n\nThe recognition came just days after the release of Harris’ newest book, 107 Days, which chronicles the shortest presidential campaign in history. Part diary, part political postmortem, the book recounts her nearly four-month push for the presidency — an effort that fell short but, in Harris’ telling, exposed the cracks in a Democratic Party infrastructure ill-prepared to support a candidate representing one of its most loyal voting blocs: Black women and the communities around them.\n\n“This experience was almost like living the campaign in reverse, which has not been easy,” Harris writes in the acknowledgments.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at the first stop of her book tour for her new book about her presidential campaign, \"107 Days,\" at the Town Hall in New York, Wednesday, Sept. 24, 2025.

All rights reserved.\n\n107 Days is at once memoir and critique — a personal account of a brutal campaign and a pointed commentary on a party and political movement that often speak of diversity but fail to build systems to sustain it. Unlike the growing shelf of books analyzing the 2024 election from the outside, Harris’s account delivers an inside view: a candidate who was also vice president, running a race few thought she could win.\n\nHarris’ message, however, extends beyond politics at such a precarious moment. Americans are staring down the barrel of a government shutdown, expanded tariffs, and a weakened social safety net following President Donald J. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, with its deep cuts to SNAP, Medicaid, and other programs serving the vulnerable.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats are limping into a midterm election year hoping to claw back at least one chamber of Congress — though their posture and message remain out of step with much of their working-class and Black base.\n\n“With your help, 75 million Americans stood with us last year on behalf of a stronger America,” Harris told the Phoenix Dinner audience on Sept. 27. “They stood with a belief in the promise of America.”\n\nWAYNE, MICHIGAN - AUGUST 08: Democratic presidential candidate, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris reacts as United Automobile Workers President Shawn Fain (R), speaks at a campaign rally at United Auto Workers Local 900 on August 8, 2024 in Wayne, Michigan.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nIn 107 Days, Harris revisits those 75 million voters, underscoring the faith she places in American workers and their central role in building a more just economy. She recalls campaign stops with the American Federation of Teachers, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in Las Vegas, and the United Auto Workers (UAW) — unions that once formed the backbone of Democratic politics, especially for Black and Brown workers.\n\n“He asked the members to show up for us it the campaign, putting into action the organizing capacity that has made unions integral to Democrats’ electoral success,” Harris writes, reflecting on her encounter with UAW President Shawn Fain during a 2024 campaign visit to UAW Local 900’s hall in Wayne, Michigan.\n\nSince then, however, the Trump administration has moved aggressively to weaken organized labor, stripping collective bargaining rights from federal employees represented by the American Federation of Government Employees. At the same time, fissures have opened within labor’s relationship to the Democratic Party itself. Both AFT President Randi Weingarten and American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employee (AFSCME) President Lee Saunders have stepped down from the party’s executive committee — a stark reminder of the peril facing poor and working families and the unions that have long sustained them.\n\nWhile other post-2024 election books dissect the missteps in staffing, strategy, and message discipline — and the Biden-Harris ticket that cast a long, quiet shadow — Harris’ account is something different. It leans into her experience as a candidate and an undervalued vice president, forced to launch a presidential campaign under extraordinary pressure while senior Biden staff and much of the mainstream media downplayed her role.\n\nHOUSTON, TEXAS - JULY 25: Vice President Kamala Harris addresses the members of the American Federation of Teachers at George R. Brown Convention Center on Thursday, July 25, 2024 in Houston.

Harris is unsparing in describing the ways in which party insiders, media narratives, and donor class hesitations all converged to undermine her candidacy. Her voice, sharp and personal, is a reminder of just how lonely the race was for her and how little infrastructure existed to support a campaign led by a Black woman.\n\nToday, the CBC–the largest caucus in the U.S. Congress–is chaired by Rep. Yvette D. Clarke (D-NY), a Black woman of Jamaican descent, similar to Harris. Although nearly half of the CBC’s members are women, the party seems unwilling to build a message or infrastructure that supports that future.\n\nTaken together, the Phoenix Award and the release of 107 Days suggest Harris is engaged in something bigger than 2024. She is shaping a narrative about herself, the Democratic Party, and the country.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, center right, and US Vice President Kamala Harris, center left, meet with members of the Congressional Black Caucus in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Feb. 2, 2023.

Photographer: Bonnie Cash/UPI/Bloomberg\n© 2023 Bloomberg Finance LP\n\nThe award tethered Harris to the legacy of the CBC and its role as the “conscience of America.” The book provides a counter-narrative to the conventional wisdom of 2024, a story in which she was not simply a failed candidate, but a truth-teller about the limits of a party that too often underestimates its most loyal base.\n\n“The answer will not come out of Washington, D.C. Their immediate take is to win the midterm and restore some checks and balances on this unchecked and unbalanced president,” states Harris.\n\nShe continued, “What we the people must understand is that the dismantling of our democracy did not start with the 2024 election.”\n\nWhether voters , and Harris’ party, are ready to hear that story is another question. For now, she has planted her flag: recognition from Black America’s political vanguard, a book that names names and lays out failures, and a moment in Washington defined by dysfunction and division.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 17: In this handout image provided by NASA, Vice President Kamala Harris hugs children that participated in hands-on STEM activities on the grounds of the Vice President's residence at the Naval Observatory on June 17, 2022, in Washington, DC.

That subsection of the Act had limited government health care benefits to American citizens, “(1) LPRs [lawful permanent residents]; (2) certain Cuban and Haitian immigrants; and (3) COFA [Compact of Free Association] migrants lawfully residing in the U.S.” The subtitle also restricts Medicare eligibility, and premium tax credits by restricting it to the four groups defined above. \n\nThe expansion of benefits to potentially reward illegal aliens with taxpayer dollars stands in stark contrast to points Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. made decades ago in Congress.\n\n“All over where we go, people say, well, can’t you stop illegal immigrants or others from coming here? And the number one answer we give our constituents is, when they come here, they can get jobs, get benefits against the law because of fraud,” Schumer, then a New York congressman, said in a speech on the House floor in 1996. A clip from that speech was reposted by Vice President JD Vance on X on Tuesday who wrote, “Chuck Schumer once recognized that it was disastrous to give illegal aliens rewards for breaking the law. Now he wants to shut down the government unless we … reward illegal aliens for breaking the law.”\n\nIn 2019 during a Democrat presidential primary debate, each candidate raised their hands in support of giving illegal aliens health coverage. That group of candidates included Joe Biden, Pete Buttigeig, Andrew Yang, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (who now represents Colorado in the Senate), Marianne Williamson, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., then-Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Co., and Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif.\n\nIn June several Democrat senators including Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., reintroduced legislation in the upper chamber to allow illegal aliens to participate in Obamacare marketplaces and to create the possibility for states to expand Medicaid and CHIP to aliens not in the country lawfully.\n\n“Health care is a human right—regardless of a person’s immigration status. With this critical legislation, we remove cruel, unnecessary barriers preventing immigrants from receiving the care they need to survive and thrive. By providing access to quality care and treatment, we strengthen our communities and bolster our nation’s public health,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., stated in a press release about the bill.","summary":"As the government appears to be barreling towards a shutdown, which will begin at midnight, Democrats are facing criticism over their alleged support for health...

And all of it goes back to one thing: greed. While you're struggling to build the basics, billionaires and corporate CEOs -- they're stacking and rigging the rules to build theirs ever higher. Look, nobody needs $100 billion just like nobody needs a 12-stack cheeseburger. It's not even like you could even enjoy it.\n\n(Abdul el-Sayed is seen on screen with a very tall cheeseburger next to a shorter one.)\n\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI (joking about the size of the huge cheeseburger with co-host Joe Scarborough): Well, I think you would argue with that, but I get the point. A new class of candidates is embracing economic populism and making waves shaking up the Democratic party. And that includes the candidate in the political ad you just saw, Abdul el-Sayed. He is running for the Senate in Michigan after incumbent Democratic Senator Gary Peters announced he would not seek reelection. The seat is seen as crucial for Democrats for the chamber's balance of power in next year's midterm elections.\n\nSince launching his campaign in April, el-Sayed has held more than 100 public events and has visited nearly 60 cities across the state of Michigan. He also got a major boost to his campaign earlier this year when he was one of the first candidates that independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont endorsed for the 2026 midterms. And Abdul Sayed joins now. He is a physician, epidemiologist, and the former health director of Wayne County, Michigan.\n\nJOE SCARBOROUGH: Doctor, thank you so much for being with us. Let's talk about the tragedy coming out of your state yesterday. It's one more place where a house of worship is attacking. We have of course seen it with synagogues across the country -- we've seen it, vandalism and shootings at mosques across the country, including a member killed in New Jersey last year. We've seen it in Christian houses of worship. We saw it yesterday at a Mormon church. Talk about that, your concerns, and what in the world can we do to stem this tide of gun violence?\n\nDr. ABDUL EL-SAYED (D-MI), SENATE CANDIDATE: ... I know that when you have a scourge of a thing that harms people, you have a responsibility to start asking, \"How do you actually solve that?\" And you look at all of the string of violence that we've seen, and they tend to have something in common. I think we have a responsibility as a country to stand together -- to stand up for our children, for our elders, for folks just going to church on a Sunday, to say that \"Enough is enough -- we need to have a conversation about gun violence,\" right? The 2nd Amendment doesn't mean any gun for anyone anywhere anytime. It means that we understand that there was a space for this, but not this, not that people walk into a church on Sunday and get gunned down, and so we need to have that conversation. We need to have it urgently. I'm hoping to sit down with folks -- everyone including gun owners to folks who are victims of gun violence to ask, \"Where is the way forward?\" because this -- this here ain't it.\n\nBRZEZINSKI: So, Doctor, we have a lot of issues to think of as a candidate you could focus on -- guns being one of them, the weaponization of the Department of Justice being another one. The National Guard going into our cities potentially across the country being yet another one of them. So where does affordability across the board play a role in terms of your message as a candidate pointing back to your political ad that we came in with?\n\n(Dr. ABDUL EL-SAYED)\n\nJONATHAN LEMIRE: So, Abdul, you're facing a crowded primary field for an important Senate race next year, but also of course Michigan looms large as a presidential swing state. Highly contested last year, Donald Trump won it again after losing it in 2020. Polling suggests that for a lot of Michigan residents in Dearborn and other places, the war in Gaza was a significant issue, and many of them broke for Trump or stayed at home because they were angry about how President Biden was handling that issue. Was your sense, as you talk to that community, do people regret that vote? And how do you see that playing into next year's campaign as the war simply continues, and Israel has only picked up their offensive under Donald Trump?\n\nSAYED: I think all of us ought to regret the circumstances that led to that. I endorsed Kamala Harris down the stretch not because I agreed with the administration's handling of Gaza, but because I believed that whether you see this from the eyes of a child in Detroit or the eyes of a child in Gaza, that Trump would have been a disaster. And we're seeing that play out right now. So everybody is deeply frustrated, but it shouldn't have had to be this way. Imagine we had the conversation last summer that we had this summer about the realities on the ground -- 18,500 kids dead -- I think we might have been in very different circumstances. And so I think the only way forward is for us as a party to stand up. This has become a Rorschach test on values -- like, you say you want to stand up for democracy, you say you want to take on the pharma CEOs that are making prescription drugs too expensive, and yet you can't call out the enforced wisdom in your own party about 18,500 people dead? I just think that it is time for truth. It's time for us to address the circumstances as it -- as it -- as it lays.\n\nThe last point I want to make here is every dollar that we send to Benjamin Netanyahu to subsidize a genocide is a dollar that's not spent to provide food for children in our community -- schools for our children in our community -- health for folks in our community -- and I think we -- folks understand that. I've been across the state, and no matter where I go -- rooms that are not in Dearborn -- folks understand that reality, and they know they're getting a bum deal.\n\nLEMIRE: So the headline today has the President meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu -- headline tomorrow potentially government shutdown. If you were in the Senate now, what would your vote be? And do you have faith in the leadership of Minority Leader Schumer? Would you want his support for your campaign?\n\nAL SHARPTON: Doctor, you're running for a seat Gary Peters had who had built some strong relationships around the Michigan community. As you may know, I have a chapter of National Action Network, Reverend Williams, strongly in Detroit, so I'm familiar with Michigan politics. ... A, what would be -- how do you propose as U.S. Senator to deal with the affordability issue in a concrete way? And how do you build a coalition? Because there's been tensions there. There are no black members of Congress now from Michigan, first time in decades. How do you build that with other communities -- the Arab American community which is substantial, progressive white community and black community which has had some tension. Not total breakup, some tension.\n\nSAYED: You asked about affordability. How do you do it? Right now, we are watching as corporations have amassed more power than they've ever had since the Gilded Age. We need a Federal Trade Commission under folks like Lina Khan who is going to stand up and actually bust trusts again. We need to instead of subsidizing huge corporations, we should subsidize small businesses. They're the ones who actually make jobs in our economy. We need strong unions -- we need to pass the PRO Act and empower unions to both form and build across sectors in our country.\n\nAnd, finally, folks say -- when you said -- I built a program that provided tens of thousands of pairs of glasses for free, and one of the things people ask is, \"How are you going to pay for that?\" Well, I kind of think in a moment of deep inequality we should have a billionaire tax. Maybe if you make 100 million bucks, you could pay a little bit more so that the kids in your community have glasses so that the infrastructure in community actually works. Those are all concrete things that we could do if we chose to do them, but not under a system that allows corporations and billionaires to buy off politicians to do their bidding.\n\nSCARBOROUGH: Doctor, I wanted to ask you about that. I mean, you know, for years we've heard about -- since Bill Clinton's victory, we've heard about Macomb County and how Macomb County swings back and forth -- but it was really more of a symbol for working Americans. I want to ask you, as you go around Michigan and you talk to working Americans, what is -- what is their reaction to the fact that Republicans have cut a trillion dollars in health care spending on this side, and, over here they've cut taxes for billionaires -- for multinational corporations -- for billionaires who run monopolies? They're allowing the consolidation of corporations instead of, like you said, breaking up these monopolies. What are you hearing from people on the ground when you knock on doors and talk to voters?\n\nSAYED: Joe, I appreciate that question because folks feel deeply betrayed, and they feel like they voted for somebody who said that he was going to unlock the system for them, and all he's done is he's locked it up even further and thrown away the key. And I was in Sault Ste. Marie in the upper part of the Upper Peninsula, and they were telling me there's a 2,000-person wait list to see a dentist -- to see a dentist. And the crazy thing is, I've served in Detroit and in Wayne County, and there are very long lines of dentists there, too.\n\nI think the real axis of our politics isn't right or left. It's: Are you locked out of the system or are you one of the ones doing the locking out? And so folks are curious, and they're interested in something that's a little bit different -- something that doesn't look like politics as usual. And they want access to the basic means of a dignified life -- a good job that pays a living wage, ability to afford your home, to ever believe you could own a home if you're over 40, the ability to buy a little extra to make some burgers on the weekends.\n\nThese are basic things that folks don't have. And in a moment -- in a time when 68 percent of people are going bankrupt just for getting cancer, we can solve our problems if we're willing to do that. And that means you've got to build a movement around unlocking the system that's going to take people who voted for Kamala Harris, people who voted Donald Trump, but people who are voting for their future.\n\nBRZEZINSKI: Democratic candidate for Senate in Michigan, Abdul el-Sayed, thanks you very much for coming on the show today.","summary":"During an interview with Dr. Abdul el-Sayed -- a Democrat running for the Senate from Michigan -- on Monday's Morning Joe, co-host Joe Scarborough sounded like a Democrat chiding Republicans for cutting taxes on the wealthy and cutting spending on health care at the same time.

The judge, appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, was unsparing not only in his views of Noem and Rubio's actions, but also of President Trump, who he said approves of \"truly scandalous and unconstitutional suppression of free speech\" on the part of two senior administration officials.\"The president's palpable misunderstanding that the government simply cannot seek retribution for speech he disdains poses a great threat to Americans' freedom of speech,\" he wrote.Of Noem and Rubio, as well as other administration officials, Young wrote that they \"acted in concert to misuse the sweeping powers of their respective offices to target noncitizen pro-Palestinians for deportation primarily on account of their First Amendment protected political speech,\" and did so through targeted deportation proceedings aimed at pro-Palestinian student activists across the country, which \"continues unconstitutionally to chill freedom of speech to this day.\"The judge issued his decision after holding a nine-day trial that examined whether the administration had violated the free speech rights of academic associations that sued the Trump administration for arrests, detentions and deportations of foreign students and faculty who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Young praised the witnesses who testified on behalf of the government, saying of them that they were \"decent, credible, dedicated nonpartisan professionals. True patriots who, in order to do their duty, have been weaponized by their highest superiors to reach foregone conclusions for most ignoble ends.\"But he accused Rubio and Noem of acting with \"invidious\" intent: \"to target a few for speaking out and then use the full rigor of the Immigration and Nationality Act (in ways it had never been used before) to have them publicly deported with the goal of tamping down pro-Palestinian student protests and terrorizing similarly situated non-citizen (and other) pro-Palestinians into silence because their views were unwelcome.\"Young further chastised the Trump administration for deploying masked agents to detain students like Tufts University doctoral student and Turkish native Rumeysa Ozturk, who was taken into custody by masked, plainclothes immigration authorities in March and spent more than a month and a half in federal immigration custody before lawyers secured her release from detention.\"This Court has listened carefully to the reasons given by Öztürk's captors for masking-up and has heard the same reasons advanced by the defendant Todd Lyons, Acting Director of ICE.

He seemingly mocked the actress by using some of her popular song names in his statement, including Save Your Tears, Get Well Soon, and Just Like Magic. The statement said:\"Save your tears, Ariana.

Get well soon, Ariana!\"In her story dated September 28, Ariana Grande reposted a post by Matt Bernstein criticizing Donald Trump and his administration. The post posed a question to the President's supporters, asking rhetorical questions such as whether their lives have gotten any \"better\" since the Republican was reelected last year. In Desai's response, he referred to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)'s recent lawsuit against Ticketmaster and Live Nation. The lawsuit alleges that these two entities misled ticket purchasers with misleading resale prices.A month ago, the FTC also filed a similar lawsuit against the ticket resale company, Key Investment Group and its affiliated organizations for sourcing tickets illegally and reselling them at inflated prices for well-known concerts. These concerts included Taylor Swift's Eras Tour and some of Grande's concerts, among others.Ariana Grande's repost about Donald Trump exploredRepublican Presidential Nominee Donald Trump Holds Election Night Event In West Palm Beach - Source: GettyIn her Instagram story dated September 28, Ariana Grande notably reshared a post by podcaster and activist Matt Bernstein.

I have one very genuine question: it’s been 250 days. now that immigrants have been violently torn from their families and communities have been destroyed, now that trans people have been blamed for virtually everything and live in fear, now that free speech is on the brink of collapse for us all — has your life gotten better?\"It continued:“Have your groceries gotten cheaper?

The singer notably showed her support for the former Vice President and Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, in the 2024 Presidential elections. She also criticized the temporary cancellation of Jimmy Kimmel's live show earlier this month by reposting one of SAG-AFTRA's posts. In other news, Ariana Grande is getting ready for her next tour in promotion of her latest studio album, Eternal Sunshine. This marks her first tour in seven years and will begin next year.

If the Russia Hoax didn’t get him, January 6 would. If the felony charges in New York didn’t get him, the felony charges in Georgia would. Joe Biden will beat him again! Kamala Harris and her Brat Summer have this thing sewn up! Look at that Iowa poll. It’s over. He’s done. The Bad Orange Man will never again be presi—wait, whuh?\n\nAnd now, at long last, the evil that is CNN and MSNBC is dead. Oh, both hate outlets still wander around not knowing they are zombies with almost no influence on public opinion, but their power is so diminished, we only check up on them to point and laugh at them, which is what I’m about to do.\n\nFor the week of September 15-21, that massive news week in the aftermath of a trans-loving leftist allegedly assassinating Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, CNN was only able to attract an average of 570,000 primetime viewers. MSNBC attracted an average of only 854,000.\n\nFor context, Fox News drew an average of 2.673 million — which is close to twice the combined viewership of CNN and MSNBC.\n\nThroughout the total day, CNN averaged only (tee hee) 400,000 viewers. MSNBC averaged only 505,000. Fox News crushed them both with 1.776 million.\n\nIn the age demo that sets advertising rates, CNN and MSNBC are dying in primetime, attracting only 87,000 and 70,000 viewers, respectively. Fox News drew 289,000.\n\nIn the same vital demo during total day viewing, CNN and MSNBC attracted only 58,000 and 44,000 demo viewers, respectively. Fox News drew 201,000.\n\nGet a load of this…\n\nCNN and MSNBC are so toxic to Normal People that during that Sunday’s memorial service for Charlie Kirk, NewsNation almost drew more viewers than CNN and MSNBC combined:\n\nBetween 1 p.m. ET and 7:15 p.m. ET on Sunday, NewsNation averaged 615,000 total viewers and 173,000 demo viewers. This was better than MSNBC, which had 287,000 total viewers and 31,000 A25-54 viewers, and CNN, which had 342,000 total viewers and 54,000 viewers in the demo during the same time period.\n\nFox’s memorial coverage drew an average of 5.2 million total viewers and 755,000 demo viewers.\n\nThe only thing keeping MSNBC and CNN alive is cable/satellite TV carriage fees. If CNN and/or MSNBC are available on your cable/satellite TV package, you are funding two outlets that hate you. No way could MSNBC and CNN survive on merit—advertising revenue based on viewership.\n\nIf you care at all about your country, family, and future, cancel your cable/satellite package today. You’ll also save a fortune by moving to streaming, and you won’t believe how much of streaming is free—including news. Best of all, you won’t be subsidizing CNN and MSNBC. \n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

YouTube froze Trump’s account in the riot’s aftermath, blocking him from posting new videos and warning his content could spark more violence. Trump sued months later, accusing YouTube and other social media giants of censorship and wrongful bans.\n\nNearly the entire settlement—$22 million—will go to Trump. According to The New York Times, the president has directed the money to the Trust for the National Mall and to the construction of his gaudy $200 million White House ballroom, which the administration says will be funded by Trump and “other patriot donors.” \n\nThe remaining $2.5 million will be divided among other plaintiffs, including anti-vaccine writer Naomi Wolf and the American Conservative Union, which organizes the infamous Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC.\n\n“If he had not been reelected, we would have been in court for 1,000 years,” Trump lawyer John P. Coale told The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the deal. “It was his reelection that made the difference.”\n\nIt’s the latest in a string of unsettling legal victories for Trump, who since last fall’s election has pulled in more than $80 million from settlements with Big Tech and major media companies. \n\nThe YouTube deal also closes the loop on a trio of lawsuits Trump filed against social media platforms after leaving office in 2021. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, agreed in January to cough up $25 million, while Elon Musk’s X, formerly known as Twitter, cut a $10 million check in February.\n\nMedia companies have caved as well. In July, Paramount agreed to pay Trump $16 million to settle his frivolous lawsuit over the editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. In December, ABC News paid $15 million to settle a defamation case involving host George Stephanopoulos.\n\nTrump clearly sees these settlements as a vindication. His administration has led pressure campaigns against institutions and individuals it views as hostile—from law firms that backed Democratic causes to prominent universities and media figures like late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. Earlier this month, Trump sued The New York Times for $15 billion in damages, though the case was quickly dismissed. Other lawsuits of his, like one against the publisher of the Wall Street Journal, is still winding its way through court.\n\nYouTube’s settlement lands at a precarious time for its parent company, Alphabet. The Justice Department is pressing to break up the tech giant’s advertising business after a federal judge ruled this spring that Google holds an illegal monopoly. A federal court is now hearing testimony on what penalties the company could face. \n\nAlphabet recently beat a similar challenge to its online-search dominance. In the meantime, top executives, including CEO Sundar Pichai, have been working to smooth relations with the Trump White House, even attending a dinner with the president this month to talk about tech and artificial intelligence.\n\nAt the same time, YouTube has been quietly rolling back moderation rules. Last week, just before news of the settlement broke, the company announced it would reinstate content creators previously banned for spreading misinformation about COVID-19 and the 2020 presidential election. \n\nFor Trump, the YouTube settlement is proof that his yearslong fight with Silicon Valley is quite literally paying off. His lawsuits against the tech giants had largely stalled before his return to the White House—a federal judge dismissed his case against Twitter in 2022, and the suits against Meta and YouTube were effectively put on hold. But after his reelection, settlements came fast.\n\nFor Alphabet, $24.5 million is pocket change. YouTube alone reported nearly $10 billion in ad revenue in the second quarter of this year. But the political cost is harder to measure. Settling with Trump makes YouTube the latest major platform to bow out of what could have been a long and ugly fight, one that risked further antagonizing a president already eager to punish tech and media foes.\n\nAnother day, another tech giant bending the knee.

The book has several behind the scenes sneak peaks. However, one of the most interesting ones perhaps is where she talked about the preparation she went under to face Donald Trump on the debate stage.\n\nThis is perhaps one of the most striking disclosures there is. Harris explained how she had to be prepared for all kinds of personal attacks. Not only she had to be ready to endure them but prepare comebacks, just in-line with Trump’s own style.\n\nWhat the world saw on the campaign trail was only part of the story.\nMy new book is a behind-the-scenes look at my experience leading the shortest presidential campaign in modern history.\n107 Days is out on September 23. I can’t wait for you to read it: https://t.co/G4bkeZB4NZ pic.twitter.com/taUof0L4hs\n— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) July 31, 2025\n\nHarris, 60, remembers how intense her debate preparations were. She and her team took refuge in the basement of Howard University in Washington, D.C., where they ran all possible scenarios. She described her advisers as akin to a “wartime consigliere.” They were determined to speculate every potential line of attack and wanted to be ready for the appropriate but biting response.\n\nDuring this prep, one of her advisors warned her that Trump might go after her personal life to unsettle her. Her. She was advised that Trump might as well ask if she ever had an abortion.\n\n“If he did, the response would be: ‘That’s none of your business and that’s not what we’re here for,'” Harris wrote.\n\nBut then, she admitted that her team also had a few darker ideas about responding in a tone similar to that of Trump. Among the suggestions was that if Trump gets up and personal, she could ask him whether he took Viagra?\n\nAnother advisor suggested she fire back with a question about whether Trump ever paid for an abortion. The idea was to counter abortion worship with an abortion question.\n\nHowever, as time may have it, Harris never had to use these questions. However, abortion did come up during the debate. It never ventured into her personal life, and she didn’t have to shuffle in her arsenal or the valid response.\n\n“In the end, he didn’t go down that track,” she wrote. “He probably knew a question like that would be exceedingly thin ice for him — and would infuriate just about every woman in America.”\n\nThe memoir has a lot more than debate prep. It offers a window into Harris’s mindset during the 107 days of her campaign. Those were definitely the most turbulent days of her career when she took over the campaign as President Joe Biden stepped aside due to concerns over his health.\n\nIn the book, Harris also admits that she even wrestled with the idea of whether she should have advised President Biden not to run in the first place.\n\n“During all those months of growing panic, should I have told Joe to consider not running? Perhaps,” she reflected.\n\nWith these revelations, 107 Days paints a candid portrait of Harris. The picture is of a politician preparing for the most combative debate of her career, where she gets into a battle mid-fight. 107 days while she navigates questions of loyalty and ambition, and reflects on the choices that shaped one of the most consequential elections in recent American history.","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris has recently released her memoir, 107 days, in which she opens up about her 2024 campaign.

If we don't win in ’26 and we give this fascist regime an unimpeded path of power for the next four years, everything we value, everything we care about, will be lost.

Trump said the countries could avoid the tariffs if they took action to stop migrants and illicit drugs such as fentanyl from entering the US.\n\nTrump suggested at the dinner that Canada become the 51st state, a taunt he would make repeatedly in the ensuing months.\n\nSoon after the Florida visit, Trudeau pointed to Harris's defeat as an example of the attack on women's progress and rights.\n\nOnce installed as the 47th president of the United States, Trump hit Canada with a barrage of tariffs on goods, including steel and aluminum products and automobiles. \n\nA background section on the economy and trade in the notes for a Trudeau call with Trump accurately predicted that economic security would be a front-burner issue for Trump's Republican administration.\n\n\"Canada should expect an administration that is more inward looking, protectionist, transactional and less committed to rules-based structures,\" the notes said.\n\n\"This poses both risks and opportunities for Canada.

She appeared to take little responsibility for her loss to President Trump in 2024 while addressing a fawning crowd of 2,000 people at the Wiltern in Los Angeles. \"I wrote the book for many reasons, but primarily to remind us how unprecedented that election was,\" Harris said about \"107 Days,\" her political memoir that was released last week. \"Think about it. A sitting president of the United States is running for reelection and three and a half months before the election decides not to run, and then a sitting vice president takes up the mantle to run against a former president of the United States who has been running for 10 years, with 107 days to go.\" She dismissed Trump's claims that his 2024 victory was so overwhelming that it was a clear mandate by the voters. \"And by the way, can history reflect on the fact that it was the closest presidential election?\" Harris said, standing from her seat on the stage as the audience cheered. \"It is important for us to remember so that we that know where we've been to decide and chart where we are.\" Trump beat Harris by more than 2.3 million votes — about 1.5% of the popular vote — but the Republican swept the electoral college vote, winning 312 to 226. Other presidential contests have been tighter, notably the 2000 contest between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore. Gore won the popular vote by nearly 544,000 votes but Bush won the electoral college vote 271 to 266 in a deeply contentious election that reached the U.S. Supreme Court. Harris, faulted for failing to connect with voters about their economic pain in battleground states in the Midwest and Southwest, criticized former President Biden about his administration's priorities. She said she would have addressed kitchen table issues before legislation about infrastructure and semiconductor manufacturing. \"I would have done the family piece first, which is affordable childcare, paid leave, extension of the child tax credit,\" she said, basic issues facing Americans who \"need to just get by today.\" Harris spoke about her book in conversation with Jennifer Welch and Angie \"Pumps\" Sullivan, the hosts of the \"I've Had It\" podcast and former cast members of the Bravo series \"Sweet Home Oklahoma.\" Attendees paid up to hundreds or thousands of dollars on the resale market for tickets to attend the event, part of a multicity book tour that began last week in New York City. The East Coast event was disrupted by protesters about Israeli actions in Gaza. Harris is traveling across the country and overseas promoting her book. The former vice president's book tour is expected to be a big moneymaker. Harris' publisher recently added another \"107 Days\" event at the Wiltern in Los Angeles on Oct. 28. The Bay Area native touched upon current news events during her appearance, which lasted shortly over an hour. About the impending federal government shutdown, Harris said Democrats must be clear that the fault lies squarely with Republicans because they control the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives. \"They are in power,\" she said, arguing that her party must stand firm against efforts to cut access to healthcare, notably the Affordable Care Act. She also ripped into Trump for his social media post of a fake artificial-intelligence-generated video of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.). The video purports to show Schumer saying that Latino and Black voters hate Democrats, so the party must provide undocumented residents free healthcare so they support the party until they learn English and \"realize they hate us too.\" Jeffries appears to wear a sombrero as mariachi music plays in the background. \"It's juvenile,\" Harris said. Trump is \"just a man who is unbalanced, he is incompetent and he is unhinged.\" Harris did not touch on the issues she wrote in her book that caused consternation among Democrats, such as not selecting former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to be her running mate because she did not believe Americans were ready to support a presidential ticket with a biracial woman and a gay man. She also did not mention her recounting of reaching out to California Gov. Gavin Newsom after Biden decided not to seek reelection, and him not responding to her beyond saying he was out hiking. Harris lamented civic and corporate leaders caving to demands from the Trump administration. Among those Trump targeted were law firms that did work for his perceived enemies. \"I predicted almost everything,\" she said. \"What I did not predict was the capitulation of universities, law firms, media corporations be they television or newspapers. I did not predict that.\" She said that while she worked in public service throughout her career, her interactions with leaders in the private sector led her to believe that they would be \"among the guardians of our democracy.\" \"I have been disappointed, deeply, deeply disappointed by people who are powerful who are bending the knee at the foot of this tyrant,\" Harris said. Harris did not mention that her husband, Doug Emhoff, is a partner at the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher that earlier this year reached an agreement with the White House to provide at least $100 million in pro bono legal work during the Republican's time in the White House and beyond. In April, the firm reached an agreement with the Trump administration, with the president saying their services would be dedicated to helping veterans, Gold Star families, law enforcement members and first responders, and that the law firm agreed to combat antisemitism and not engage in diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Emhoff, who joined the law firm in January and also is now on the faculty at USC , has condemned his law firm's agreement with the administration. Emhoff, who was in attendance at the event and posing for pictures with Harris supporters, declined to comment about the event. \"I'm just here to support my wife,\" he said.","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris defended her 2024 presidential campaign and lamented President Trump's actions at a book event in Los Angeles on Monday.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-09-30/kamala-harris-book-107-days-wiltern-biden-trump","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a02f8c6/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3499x2333+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F45%2F32%2F7fac16ee4351889b33d57598fee1%2F1523549-pol-kamala-ha","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-30 14:33:08","author":"Seema Mehta","authors":["Seema Mehta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.226},{"id":365003108,"title":"The “Minneapolis Mamdani” won’t let racist attacks stop him","text":"Omar Fateh steadied himself before the camera and flashed a smile between heavy blinks, the weight of a nearly sleepless night tugging at his eyelids. This interview — first slated for the week prior — had been rescheduled in the wake of a major life change. The two-term Minnesota state senator and his wife welcomed a new baby, a son they named Imran, in early August.\n\n“I pulled almost an all-nighter last night, so he’s been keeping us up,” he said, exhaling a light chuckle. He also has plenty of other reasons to be tired.\n\nThe 35-year-old is running for mayor of Minneapolis, one half of the Twin Cities he’s called home for 10 years. He’s the leading candidate facing off against two-term incumbent mayor Jacob Frey, who has the backing of the Democratic establishment and its donors. Oh, and he’s a proud Democratic socialist, an affiliation that’s brought him comparisons to New York’s own mayoral frontrunner, Zohran Mamdani, and a world of criticism from people across the political spectrum.\n\nNeedless to say, Fateh is more than aware of what his potential win could mean for the future of the Democratic Party in Minneapolis. His critics see his socialist campaign and his growing popularity in the city as a threat — and he’s more than here for it.\n\n“They can try to call me a socialist like it’s an insult,” Fateh said. “I’m not here to manage the status quo. I’m here to fight for the people that the city has historically left behind, and I think that folks in our city are ready for a new type of politics and a city that works for everyone.”\n\nAmerican-born, socialist bred\n\nFateh credits his upbringing with his knowing how to build the kind of city that would work for everyone. He’s a proud son of Somali immigrants and a Muslim — the first Minnesota state senator of both his heritage and his faith — who was born in Washington, D.C. and raised in Virginia, with summers spent with relatives in Minnesota.\n\nHe moved to Minneapolis in the mid-2010s to work for state and local government, starting in a role where he bolstered the city’s outreach to its East African communities, including the nation’s largest Somali diaspora community. He ran for state Senate in 2020, clinching the Democratic nomination by 9% over incumbent Jeff Hayden, and has held the office since.\n\n“I feel like I have the lived experiences and understand the needs of the everyday person, and that really connects with what I’ve seen across the city,” Fateh said. Voters “are really tired of excuses,” and “what we understand is that, yes, communities might speak different languages, but they share the same struggles.”\n\nFateh made sure to make clear that he’s an “American-born, Somali American” who grew up in the United States, an emphasis stemming from a surge in online, xenophobic harassment because of a campaign by right-wing pundits this past summer.\n\nHis rise in national name ID ahead of the Minneapolis Democratic Farmer-Labor Party convention in July brought with it attacks from the likes of far-right Libs of TikTok founder Chaya Raichik, as well as the late right-wing podcaster and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. Raichik shared a photo of Fateh with a caption falsely claiming “the average IQ in Somalia is 68,” while Kirk, across multiple posts about Fateh, accused Muslims of taking over the government and called for an end to “all third world immigration to America.” Other far-right social media users took the rhetoric and ran with it, questioning Fateh’s citizenship and further maligning Somalia in the process.\n\n“When extremists like them come after me, or campaigns like mine — to me, it means that we’re doing something right,” Fateh said. “That they’re scared of a working-class, multiracial coalition that is rising in Minneapolis and that we’re also seeing across our nation.”\n\nLast week, the online attacks turned into a real-world threat. Fateh’s campaign office in Minneapolis was vandalized with a message that read, “Somali Muslim — this warning is no joke.” Co-campaign manager Akhilesh Menawat told CBS News that the vandalism was even more alarming given that Fateh’s name was on the list carried by the suspect accused of assassinating a Minnesota state lawmaker and wounding another in June.\n\n“They’re trying to scare us, but we aren’t backing down,” Menawat said in a statement, noting that the team is discussing security measures. “Let’s use this moment not to fall for intimidation tactics but to lock arms and win this race.”\n\nShould he become the city’s first Muslim mayor, Fateh’s goals are simple but sweeping: build a Minneapolis that working people can afford by increasing the minimum wage to $20 by 2028 and securing rent stabilization; diversify the city’s public safety response by expanding it to include non-police responders like social workers; protect undocumented immigrants from the federal government by preventing MPD from interacting with ICE; and approach homelessness with compassion by establishing a “just cause” eviction policy, which outlines lawful justifications for landlords to evict a tenant; and supporting a housing-first model for getting people off the streets\n\nAsked how he plans to implement those changes, Fateh said he’d connect with colleagues and community — connections he claimed the incumbent mayor has failed to maintain — as he’s done during his time as state senator for the South Side. Much of his successful legislation has come from community members visiting his office and educating him on the issues that affect them, he said. So far, his biggest wins include securing tuition-free college for students from families making less than $80,000, increasing protections and wages for rideshare drivers and legalizing fentanyl test strips.\n\n“We’ve built a broad coalition, and with that coalition, that’s the same kind of energy we need to go in and do the work,” Fateh said. “This can’t happen without community, and at a time when we have so much unmet need in the city, and a time we have a hostile federal government, we can’t afford to have a mayor that doesn’t want to put in the work or connect with council members … We don’t have the luxury of waiting another four years for progress.”\n\nA spokesperson for Frey did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n“Fighting for a city”\n\nThe frequent comparisons of Mamdani and Fateh have been flooding in since July. Political observers chiefly highlight their youth, immigrant background, faith, socialist views and opposition from centrist Democrats.\n\nThe Minnesota lawmaker embraces the comparison to the would-be mayor of New York City, the so-called “Minneapolis Mamdani” pointing to his DSA counterpart’s primary win in June as a signal that Americans are ready to exchange decades of mainstream Democratic policies for socialist solutions.\n\nThe spike in Americans’ interest in socialism and the DSA is also a great indicator of that, according to Cara Tobe, a member of DSA’s national political committee. Tobe said that the organization’s membership is at more than 85,000 and growing by the hundreds each day after a multi-year dip following the 2020 election. A recent Gallup poll found that, while Americans overall overwhelmingly back capitalism, 66% of Democrats view socialism positively, which is up from 57% in 2018. A March 2025 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute also found that 62% of 18-29-year-olds hold a “favorable view” of socialism.\n\n“What we’re seeing [in Minneapolis], and we’re seeing this in other places as well, especially from the post-George Floyd world, is working Americans, working-class people of all colors… are really wanting to see change,” Tobe said. “Change that supports and protects them.”\n\nFateh insisted he’s the one who can bring that about, and he’s asking Minneapolitans to rank him first, followed by attorney Jazz Hampton and ex-Minnesota Senate chaplain DeWayne Davis, in the November election. He said Minneapolis residents’ commitment to social justice, as seen in the 2020 protests following the police murder of George Floyd, has motivated his mayoral bid.\n\n“But what I’ve said also is it feels a little bit different because now I’m a father,” Fateh added. “I’m not only fighting to fix a broken system, but I’m fighting for a city that I’m going to be raising my son in, and I want to make sure that it’s a city that values and honors everyone.”\n\nBy August, Fateh was at the top of his game, having won the Minneapolis DFL’s endorsement a month before. Receiving the endorsement over the incumbent hadn’t happened since the party’s founding, he said.\n\nBut on Aug. 21, the Minnesota DFL vacated that endorsement, igniting a battle not just with the Fateh campaign but its own party.\n\nIn a 10-page report, the state DFL said it revoked the endorsement due to alleged failures in the voting process, which led to an undercount and a mayoral candidate being erroneously dropped from consideration. It also barred the Minneapolis DFL from endorsing a mayoral candidate this year.\n\nJohn Maraist, Minneapolis DFL chair, told Salon that the electronic voting system had a technical error that undercounted the ballots cast during the day, and the delegates decided to pivot to a show of badges to determine the winner by nightfall. Frey, he said, had asked his delegates to leave in order to deny quorum. But nearly 480 delegates remained — and Fateh clearly won the majority of them.\n\n“It was very clear that Sen. Fateh had far over the 60% of shown display badges to earn the endorsement,” said Maraist, who added that the Minneapolis DFL appealed the revocation. In a hearing on Monday, the DFL State Executive Committee voted overwhelmingly to uphold the August decision.\n\nFrey, whose campaign filed the challenge that led to the rule committee’s decision, praised the state party for the revocation and ensuring that all the candidates “get treated equally by the DFL in November.”\n\nFateh, however, has accused the committee of “insider games,” “backroom decisions,” and being Frey supporters and donors. In a statement, co-campaign manager Graham Faulkner argued that the decision was a political one, “not one based on the facts presented to the committee or the rules.”\n\n“Our campaign and supporters see this for what it is: disenfranchisement of thousands of Minneapolis caucus-goers and the delegates who represented all of us on convention day,” he said.\n\nStart your day with essential news from Salon.\nSign up for our free morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nA nationwide tension in a local race\n\nIn many ways, Minneapolis’ mayoral race is a microcosm of the Democratic National Committee’s battle for definition post-2024 election, according to David Schultz, a professor of political science at Hamline University in Minnesota. Progressives like Fateh saw the outcome of the presidential election as an indication that moving further left on the political spectrum was the best option. Establishment Democrats, however, argue that then-Vice President Kamala Harris embraced a political agenda that’s too far left for most Americans.\n\n“We just don’t know that the people who showed up for the [Minneapolis DFL] convention are a fair representative sample of where the electorate is in this election,” Schultz said.\n\nThe Minneapolis race is grappling with the same tension, compounded with nationwide issues of surging rent prices, gun violence and the affordability crisis, as well as its own context being the epicenter of an effort to defund police, Schultz said. Donations to Mayor Frey, meanwhile, have far outpaced his opponents, with recent filings showing he’s received $722,226 in contributions, many from the city’s business leaders. Fateh has raised $202,426 largely from smaller donations, though he may benefit from the high mobilization of the local DSA, which has achieved an almost veto-proof majority in the city council in recent years.\n\nWhich camp — progressives or mainstream Democrats — will ultimately be better mobilized in what is likely to be a low turnout election is to be seen.\n\n“You have to get the proverbial 50% plus one of the voters, which means you need to figure out where most of the voters are, and the evidence is not suggesting, right now, that among existing voters, or easily among potential voters, going further to the left is the answer,” Schultz said.\n\nA poll of 822 voters taken in late August from leftist political action committee Minneapolis for the Many, which has endorsed Fateh, found that Fateh is within 5 points of Frey, netting 28% support to Frey’s 34%. A plurality of undecided respondents said they had an unfavorable view of Frey at 35%, while indicating that they don’t know his opponents. Fateh, however, has improved his name recognition among voters by 25% since May, the poll found.\n\nFateh, as evidence of his increased recognition, said he’s seen increased engagement from young people and a surge in campaign volunteers. Americans are paying attention to the current political moment to see what the rise in socialist candidates like himself means, he said, and that’s an inflection point critical to determining the Democratic Party’s future.\n\n“People are really hungry for more authentic candidates that are speaking to the needs of everyday people, and the everyday voter doesn’t look at it as left or right. They just see it as ‘How are these candidates going to affect my everyday life?’” he said.\n\n“What we’re seeing is that not only [do] they want to see these candidates, but these candidates can win,” he added.","summary":"Omar Fateh tells Salon that he must be \"doing something right\" if he makes right-wing bigots so angry","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/09/30/the-minneapolis-mamdani-wont-let-racist-attacks-stop-him/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/09/omar-fateh-2229615359-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-30 14:30:37","author":"Tatyana Tandanpolie","authors":["Tatyana Tandanpolie"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.095},{"id":364870992,"title":"White House fumes at Ariana Grande after she asks MAGA if their lives are better under Trump","text":"The White House is pushing back hard after pop star Ariana Grande publicly questioned whether President Donald Trump’s 250 days in office have yielded tangible benefits for the public.\n\nGrande, 32, shared an Instagram post by podcast host and makeup artist Matt Bernstein, who asked Trump voters a pointed series of questions.\n\n“It’s been 250 days.

They drank Medalla beer and danced salsa. \n\nOver the course of a 31-date residency at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan, Bad Bunny worked a miracle, inspiring patriotism in the hearts of a proud Boricua people, and in those traveling to Puerto Rico for the first time. He performed on two stages, one showcasing the island's natural beauty with its flamboyan and plantain trees, and another, a casita (“little house”), for the pari de marquesina, a house party. \n\nIf all the world's a stage — might as well make it home.\n\nIn February, it can be expected that the artist born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio will bring the same spirit to the 2026 Super Bowl. And he'll do so in Spanish — a landmark moment for Latino culture.\n\n From Puerto Rico to the Super Bowl \n\nBad Bunny's “No Me Quiero Ir De Aquí” residency (in English, “I Don’t Want to Leave Here”) bypassed a traditional U.S. tour, bringing approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generating an estimated $733 million for Puerto Rico. Across three hours, attendees were guided through a musical history — reggaetón hits from Bad Bunny's singular discography as well as the folkloric styles of his latest album, “Debí Tirar Más Fotos.” (“I Should Have Taken More Photos.\")\n\nThere was a political history, too: like in the affecting song “Lo Que Pasó a Hawaii,” (“What Happened to Hawaii”), a rallying cry for Puerto Rico's autonomy. Or 2022's “El Apagón” (“The Blackout”), in reference to Hurricane Maria, its aftermath and the continued anger and frustration over persistent, chronic power outages.\n\nOf course, a Super Bowl halftime show traditionally runs 12 to 15 minutes. It's not a lot of time to bring Puerto Rico, or its complicated colonial history, to the NFL's mainstream — but it is enough for a taste. \n\nIt's worth mentioning Benito has done so before: making a surprise appearance at the Super Bowl in 2020, during Shakira and Jennifer Lopez's performance. He sang in Spanish alongside two artists whose bilingual hits helped usher in a crossover era for Latin music in the ‘00s. He’s a direct inheritor of their successes, and he's been able to kick the door down further — helping to establish an industry where Latino superstars need not record their music in English to have a career.\n\nBad Bunny is simultaneously an interesting and an obvious choice for the NFL: One of the most popular artists on the planet who understands that going global means embracing the local, performing during the most-watched television program of the year. \n\n A pick with political considerations \n\nIn a recent interview with i-D Magazine, Bad Bunny mentioned that one of the reasons his residency bypassed the continental U.S. were concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos.\n\n“There was the issue of — like, (expletive) ICE could be outside (my concert). And it’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about,” he told the publication, referencing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico since large-scale arrests began in late January, surprising many in the U.S. territory that has long welcomed migrants.) It resonated with Latinos and the Spanish speaking community, who have grown increasingly weary amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment and raids, as President Donald Trump’s immigration policies and executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation.\n\nBad Bunny has long been critical of Trump and backed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. “I will never forget what Donald Trump did and what he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader,” he said in a video last year.\n\nFor some Trump supporters, Bad Bunny's booking at the 2026 Super Bowl is a divisive political pick. Conservative commentator Benny Johnson described Bad Bunny as an “anti-ICE activist\" on Instagram.\n\nRyan Fournier, chair of Students for Trump, said that “whoever picks these people should be fired.”\n\nFor others, Bad Bunny's booking is cause for celebration. “Go get em Bad Bunny!\" wrote Bruno Mars on X.\n\nRoc Nation founder Jay-Z, who oversees the Super Bowl booking, said in a statement that what Bad Bunny has “done and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring. We are honored to have him on the world’s biggest stage.”\n\nAt the very least, Bad Bunny, who performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, is set to make history, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English.\n\nThe question is — what messages will Bad Bunny deliver in a culture where identity is politicized? And what does it mean that his performance arrives in the midst of one of the largest immigration crackdowns in U.S. history, where Latinos are especially vulnerable?\n\n T he Super Bowl halftime show after Kendrick Lamar \n\nIn February, Kendrick Lamar's 2025 Super Bowl halftime performance made art of his short set, offering a meta commentary on race and America. “The revolution ’bout to be televised,” he announced early in the performance.\n\nIt featured actor Samuel L. Jackson as Uncle Sam, whose character critiqued the rapper and his dancers dressed in red, white and blue for being “too loud, too reckless, too ghetto,” reminding them to “play the game.” There was the sense that Lamar was breaking the fourth wall, reminding viewers of the NFL's political associations following Colin Kaepernick’s kneeling protests and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThat Lamar was able to weave American themes into his history-making performance as the first solo hip-hop artist to ever headline the coveted slot will no doubt benefit Bad Bunny. At the very least, he may learn from the rapper's layered and conceptual narratives, that messages on the NFL stage do not need to be explicit to be effective.\n\n A star-studded affair \n\nAt every date of his residency, Bad Bunny invited celebrities — among them LeBron James, Penélope Cruz and Kylian Mbappé — to join in his party. He also performed with many musicians, including Puerto Rico heavyweights Jowell y Randy, Arcángel and notably Marc Anthony. The pair duetted “Preciosa\" — a song Anthony had not sung in public in 20 years.\n\n“Preciosa” was written by Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hernández Marín in 1937 and is viewed as an unofficial anthem for the island. It references Puerto Rico's hybrid identity — a mix of Spanish, African and the indigenous Taino cultures — and threats made to the island in its long colonial history (“No importa el tirano te trate con negra maldad,” goes the chorus. “It doesn’t matter that the tyrant treats you with black hatred.”) It also arrived shortly after the 1937 Ponce massacre, in which a peaceful march organized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party ended in a police shooting where 19 died and 200 were injured.\n\nIt's common for Super Bowl halftime performances to bring surprise guests into their sets — and no doubt Bad Bunny will do the same — but who he chooses will wait to be seen. If he pulls from the book of Lamar, any collaboration may have veiled political weight — informed by his residency, but softened for the NFL crowd.","summary":"Bad Bunny captivated audiences with his residency in Puerto Rico, inspiring patriotism and drawing half a million people to the island this summer","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/puerto-rico-spanish-latinos-jayz-new-york-b2836516.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/21/15/Puerto_Rico_Bad_Bunny_75031.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-30 13:01:51","author":"Maria Sherman","authors":["Maria Sherman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.453},{"id":364870042,"title":"How Democrats’ War On Energy Could Cost Them Governor’s Mansion In Deep Blue Stronghold","text":"Some New Jersey citizens are facing rising utility costs after years of aggressive Democratic-endorsed green energy policies, as new polling shows the gubernatorial race locked in a dead heat.\n\nNew Jersey has been under Democratic control for years with a long-standing Democratic-led Legislature, but Republican gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli is now tied at 43% with his opponent, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, according to a new Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill survey released Thursday. Ciattarelli has repeatedly noted that Sherrill backs energy policies similar to those of current Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, which, according to several energy policy experts who spoke with the Daily Caller News Foundation, have undermined grid reliability and saddled residents with high utility bills.\n\n“As a result of the New Jersey Energy Master Plan, we’re in a lot of trouble here,” President of the Garden State Initiative Audrey Lane told the DCNF, referencing the state’s energy plan. “New Jersey families and businesses were already feeling the strain from higher taxes, rising fares and tolls, and increasing insurance costs when energy rates jumped 20%. Families are making tough choices every day to manage costs in their own homes, and they rightly expect the state to do the same with their tax dollars. Yet the aspirational Energy Master Plan offered no real cost analysis, and our research shows it will cost the state more than $5 billion annually and drive a 35% increase in rates. As voters consider the next governor, they will seek leadership that prioritizes energy policies that are affordable, reliable, and practical — not just aspirational.” (RELATED: New Jersey Dems Continue To Rail Against Grid Operator For Energy Crisis Of Their Own Making)\n\nSherrill’s slipping lead in the final stretch of the race could give Ciattarelli the momentum needed to stage an upset in a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris won by just six points in 2024 and Murphy won only narrowly in his 2021 reelection. Both Sherrill and Ciattarelli have made energy policy central to their campaigns, with Sherrill vowing to halt utility rate hikes for the “average” New Jersey family over the next year and Ciattarelli blaming high costs on Democrat policies that drove out supply while chasing offshore wind expansion.\n\nThe Emerson College survey, as well as another August poll from Fairleigh Dickinson University, found that Garden State voters are split on who to blame for their high energy bills, though they agree that the problem is severe.\n\n“New Jersey Democrats blame utility companies for the cost of utilities at 36%, whereas Republicans blame Governor Murphy at 36% — independents are split between the governor (27%) and utility companies (23%),” executive director of Emerson College Polling Spencer Kimball said Thursday.\n\nNew Jersey shut down all its coal plants by 2022 and Democratic leadership has charged forward pursuing a green energy transition. The state is a net importer of energy, with one-fifth of its power supplied from generators in other states in 2023, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.\n\nThe Garden State has aggressive green energy targets, aiming for a grid powered by a 50% green energy portfolio by 2030, with Murphy setting a goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035.\n\n“Governor Murphy, on his way out, is doubling down. He’s not making any attempt to change the policy before he leaves, other than to try and codify what he’s done,” Lane told the DCNF, also drawing attention to New Jersey importing energy. “If you go back about seven years, we were close to neutral. Now we’re importing about 30–35% of energy, which is a very big swing.”\n\nCiattarelli has also pointed to New Jersey’s reliance on imported energy as a major concern and has pledged to withdraw the state from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), ban offshore wind farms along the coast and implement a new energy plan that forwards an “all-of-the-above energy policy,” according to his campaign website.\n\nEnergy sector experts like Lane, among others, have pointed out that offshore wind is a costly energy source.\n\nCiattarelli has targeted Sherrill over her “push” for “extreme energy mandates,” brandishing her policies as expensive, though Sherrill has asserted that more “clean” power will help lower energy costs for New Jersey. (RELATED: Chris Christie pulls New Jersey out of Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative)\n\n 🚨Caught on tape: Mikie Sherrill admits that she and Phil Murphy knew their push for wind turbines and extreme energy mandates would cost New Jerseyans “an arm & a leg”—and did it anyway. Sherrill and Murphy broke our energy policy, and NJ families are paying the price in… pic.twitter.com/QBvbE2Yxbx — Jack Ciattarelli (@Jack4NJ) September 12, 2025 \n\nSherrill has vehemently disagreed with Ciattarelli’s characterization of her energy policies, a spokesperson writing that one campaign ad claiming Sherrill knew a “push for wind turbines and extreme energy mandates” would increase costs “is a blatantly misleading, desperate smear from Jack Ciattarelli’s MAGA allies and makes crystal clear they’re terrified that Mikie’s plan for a State of Emergency on Utility Costs is dominating the in-state conversation.”\n\nThe Democratic candidate has backed policies similar to Murphy’s, advocating for a build-out of more intermittent green energy sources like solar and offshore wind. She voted against a March 2024 House bill that sought to label a carbon tax as harmful to the U.S. economy and supported former President Joe Biden’s landmark climate law, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nSherrill also wrote in a September 2024 op-ed that “we all have a responsibility to leave our state, our nation, and our planet better than we found it. We can do just that by reaffirming Governor Murphy’s plan for New Jersey’s commitment to a strong and thriving offshore wind industry.”\n\nAs outlined in her “day one declaration,” Sherrill has pledged to address high energy costs by streamlining the “modernization” of natural gas facilities, “immediately” developing plans to expand nuclear capacity and starting new solar and battery projects. However, she did not mention any plans for offshore wind expansion in her declaration, though she opposed the federal crackdown on offshore wind during the June 10 debate with Ciattarelli.\n\nSherrill has promised voters that as part of her “day one declaration,” she will block utility rate hikes. However, Murphy told a local news outlet that he is “not sure” how Sherrill could do that.\n\n“I’m not sure how you’d actually do that,” Murphy told the New Jersey Globe. “These are private-sector players. I’m not sure if she got into the details as to how you do it, but we’ve been spending morning, noon, and night on energy, energy sources, energy affordability for years.”\n\nMurphy’s office did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.\n\n“It is a smart strategy for Jack Ciattarelli campaign on the importance of American energy production, because American energy dominance means more access to affordable and reliable energy for New Jersey families and businesses,” Mark Bednar, Republican Strategist & Principal at Monument Advocacy, told the DCNF. “Additionally, it’s smart politics on Ciattarelli’s part to highlight how Mikie Sherrill has routinely taken votes in her time in the House designed to hurt American oil and natural gas production. She can’t hide from her record, and it will be incumbent on the Ciattarelli campaign to continue to share it with New Jersey voters.” (RELATED: Democrats Blame Grid Operator For Energy Crisis Of Their Own Making)\n\n New Jersey families are getting crushed with 17–20% hikes on their electric bills.

Glenn Youngkin, have pointed to PJM Interconnection, the major grid operator in their states, as the culprit for climbing energy costs. Democrats have been phasing out coal plants in the region as part of their aggressive green energy policies, while choking off energy supply as demand takes off.\n\n“We understand the political motive to shift blame for high electricity bills, but the fact remains: PJM operates as a not-for-profit that plans the power grid and administers federally regulated wholesale electricity markets,” a spokesperson for PJM told the DCNF previously. “Pointing fingers will not solve the supply-and-demand realities driving higher prices for consumers in New Jersey, including challenges that stem from failed policies. Our focus remains on working toward real solutions, because New Jerseyans deserve nothing less.”\n\nLane explained to the DCNF that “PJM had been sounding the alarm bells for years that new, intermittent energy sources were not going to fill the void of the base-load generation we were losing.” Lane and Manhattan Institute fellow Ken Girardin told the DCNF that decommissioning power plants while demand continues to climb is a major source of New Jersey’s energy woes.\n\n“A lot of the rising electricity rates in New Jersey, and elsewhere, boil down to power plants retiring and demand rising faster than new capacity is coming online. The lights are staying on because the market is working, but that’s come at a cost,” Girardin told the DCNF. “New Jersey also rejoined RGGI in 2020, which pushes up the cost of energy from fossil fuel power plants. That has helped push up monthly bills, though to a lesser extent than the supply and demand issues.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

More than 125 million people will tune in to watch live. Even more will see clips of the performance on social media afterward. It is a life-changer for any artist to have that kind of exposure. \n\nIN FOCUS: WHY SCHUMER HAS TO SHUT IT DOWN\n\nBad Bunny is also a far-left activist. He announced earlier this year that he would no longer do concerts in the United States because of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, which no longer allow for unfettered entry into the country to the tune of millions. He is also vehemently against Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agents who are expelling violent criminals from the country.\n\n“Look, those motherf****** [ICE] are in these cars, RAV-4s. They’re here in Pontezuela,” Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, raged recently.\n\nAmong those arrested by ICE in Puerto Rico is Maykel Negrín Núñez, who had been charged with homicide, violations of gun laws, illegal transportation of firearms, and spousal abuse. \n\nBad Bunny apparently takes issue with Núñez being detained. \n\nHe also announced he would no longer perform on the U.S. mainland due to ICE having the audacity to do its job outside his concerts.\n\n“There was the issue of — like, f****** ICE could be outside [my concert]. And it’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about,” he said in an interview earlier this year. \n\nWhat changed about Bad Bunny’s staunch principle around not performing in America anymore? He has agreed to be the featured act during the Super Bowl in Santa Clara in February. Is he making an exception because he’ll be watched by more than 100 million people live?\n\n“What I’m feeling goes beyond myself. It’s for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture, and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”\n\nIt appears money can buy happiness. \n\nWhat exactly is the National Football League thinking here? Does Commissioner Roger Goodell even know who Bad Bunny is? Could he identify even one of his songs? \n\nThe answers are likely no and no. But it’s not Goodell who makes the decision here, but rapper and businessman Jay-Z, to whom the NFL outsources the halftime show decision-making process. As for Goodell, he likely just rubber stamps the selection. \n\n“What Benito has done and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring. We are honored to have him on the world’s biggest stage,” Jay-Z said in a statement. \n\nYes, there’s nothing more inspiring than hiring someone who hates federal agents expelling the worst elements of society back to their homelands. Totally. \n\nAs every dishonest broker in the illegal immigration debate does, Bad Bunny purposely conflates illegal immigration with legal immigration. In one music video, he hires a Trump impersonator to apologize to the “immigrants of America.” \n\n“I made a mistake,” the voice says to a group of Latinos huddled around a radio listening to the faux-Trump. “I want to apologize to the immigrants in America. I mean the United States, I know America is the whole continent. I want to say that this country is nothing without the immigrants. This country is nothing without Mexicans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Colombians, Venezuelans, Cubans—” it continues before the group shuts off the radio in disbelief before walking away. \n\nAgain, for the billionth time, Trump is not anti-immigrant. He’s literally married to one. \n\n“Legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways,” Trump said in a State of the Union Address, among dozens of other times. “I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally.”\n\nAnd that’s the trick: They have to come in legally. And if they enter the U.S. illegally and commit crimes, they’ll be the first to be deported. Voters overwhelmingly approve of this. Per Pew Research, 97% of Americans support deporting illegal immigrants who have committed violent crimes. In the same poll, just 37% of voters are against deporting all of those here illegally, regardless of their criminal record. \n\nMr. Bunny is in that 37% opposition. \n\nThey say that rock ‘n’ roll is here to stay. But it is clearly no longer welcome at the Super Bowl. In fact, with the addition of Bad Bunny in 2026, you have to go back 16 years to find the last rock band that performed on America’s biggest stage (The Who in 2010). Over the years, the NFL was smart enough to bring in not only rock’s biggest performers but also country and pop stars and rappers, including the King of Pop, Michael Jackson, in 1993.\n\nJust days before Election Day 2024, after a comedian almost no one has ever heard of (Tony Hinchiffe) told a joke about Puerto Rico at a Trump rally, Bad Bunny voiced his support for former Vice President Kamala Harris, winning him plaudits from the legacy news media.\n\n“Who won the day? Bad Bunny,” Politico declared on Oct. 29, “Bad Bunny won the day because he elevated the celebrity endorsement in a way that spoke to a specific community at a crucial moment in the race.” \n\n“It has the potential to help turn this into one of the more important moments in Puerto Rican and mainland politics in decades for the five million U.S. citizens identifying as Puerto Rican who live here — including half a million in battleground Pennsylvania,” it adds. \n\nMy goodness, this is 31 flavors of delusion. When is the legacy media going to get it through their heads that celebrity endorsements don’t matter?\n\nHarris paid millions of dollars to the likes of Beyoncé, Bruce Springsteen, Eminem, and Lady Gaga, among many others, to have them perform during her rallies. And all that got her were zero wins in swing states while losing the popular vote. The same goes for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016, when she also went the “people totally vote because a celebrity told them to vote a certain way” route and lost a race many believed she could never lose. \n\nBad Bunny — at least for now, unless the NFL comes to their senses — will perform the Super Bowl 60 halftime show. \n\nThe NFL has produced record-breaking ratings and thrilling games to start the season. \n\nBut by doing this, it is begging a large chunk of the country to publicly denounce its product again in the same way it did when it welcomed Black Lives Matter with open arms. \n\nGoodell has sacked himself and the league here. \n\nAnd for no good reason.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

They said: \"He might ask you if you've ever had an abortion.\"\n\nThe former attorney writes how she came up with various responses she could ask on the back of that question, penning: \"If he did, the response would be: That's none of your business and that's not what we're here for.\"\n\nBut not everyone in the room was pleased with the beige response, and instead proposed she flip it on Trump with an X-rated question.\n\n\"[Harris was told] that if he got that personal, I should ask if he took Viagra,\" the Californian wrote. \n\nWhile another advisor suggested she take it further, with the question: \"Had he ever paid for an abortion?\"\n\nThe 79-year-old never posed the question - which she actually saw as a victory.\n\n\"In the end, he didn't go down that track. He probably knew a question like that would be exceedingly thin ice for him - and would infuriate just about every woman in America,\" Harris added.\n\nTrump's presidential campaign against Harris was anything but clean, and while he didn't ask her the offensive question that they had prepped for, he had gone as far as questioning her ethnicity on his way to victory.\n\nSpeaking at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago - in July last year - he said: \"I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black.\"","summary":"![CDATA[As the Democratic Party's presidential candidate prepared to take on Trump in a debate, she was urged to prepare for 'personal attacks']]","url":"https://www.unilad.com/news/politics/kamala-harris-trump-debate-memoir-159314-20250930","image":"https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/blt196788c01d95b6fe/68dba5600d8915afc869d760/kamala-harris-trump-question.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-30 11:21:13","author":"Joe Yates","authors":["Joe Yates"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":364809706,"title":"The next big debate Democrats can’t dodge","text":"When a shooter opened fire on an immigration facility in Dallas last week, killing at least one migrant detainee in the process, it fit into a recent pattern of escalating tension — and violence — that has increasingly defined President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.\nAt the center of this growing strain is one agency in particular: the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which has been deputized to carry out Trump’s anti-immigrant directives across the nation.\nThe Republican response to the Dallas shooting was uniform: They condemned it as the latest example of left-wing inspired violence against law enforcement. Politicians, activists, and commentators rushed to count it as evidence that Democrats specifically were “inciting” aggression against ICE, aiding criminals, and hampering Trump’s agenda. “This violence is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to ‘Nazis,’” Trump posted on Truth Social. The White House then released a list of Democrats’ criticism of ICE, calling their words “a battle cry for violence.”\nDemocratic responses, meanwhile, were splintered. Most national Democrats have remained quiet — including candidates running in competitive battleground races like Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio and former Gov. Roy Cooper in North Carolina, and progressives in Congress. House and Senate leadership condemned violence against law enforcement, while Texas Democrats said, “no one — those in uniform, civilians, or immigrants — should be subject to the senseless violence.”\nThere are plenty of reasons more Democrats haven’t spoken up — many details are still unknown. But this split in reactions reflects a deeper divide between the parties and among Democrats. Republicans are all-in on ICE, while Democrats are coming to realize that they need to decide what to say, and what to propose to do, about the agency.\nThis debate stands to explode during the midterms and the run-up to 2028. Americans are growing more positive on immigration and more negative on ICE. Parts of the Democratic base are yearning for their leadership to fight Trump’s push for dramatic numbers of deportations. And it’s increasingly clear that the question of what to do about ICE, especially if and when Democrats regain power, is looming over the party’s leadership and prospective 2028 candidates.\nThe past few weeks have also seen a growing number of examples of apparent ICE agent overreach: viral videos of manhandling of civilians, arresting or harassing Democratic politicians themselves — such as those of a mayor and congresswoman in New Jersey and a mayor and congressional candidate in Illinois — and street patrols in major cities. The result? The debate among Democrats about ICE is going to grow more intense.\nThe case for avoiding the elephant-sized ICE agent in the room\nSince Kamala Harris’s loss last year, the conventional wisdom has solidified: Americans backed Trump and the GOP over Democrats last year in part because of distrust and dissatisfaction with the incumbent party’s handling of the economy, but also because of its leftward drift on border policy and liberalizing of immigration policy during the Biden years.\nParticularly during the 2020 presidential primary cycle, Democratic hopefuls tried to outflank each other on immigration from the left, embracing a series of reforms, like abolishing ICE, executive actions, and positions that were more welcoming and accepting of both legal and illegal immigration.\nThat more humanitarian and progressive Biden-era approach to immigrants, to asylum-seekers, and to the border ended up turning much of the country against high immigration levels. It also turned many toward the Trump campaign — which promised more aggressive border enforcement, increased deportations, and stricter restrictions on migration.\nSeeing signs of this drift, Harris, once she became the nominee, and other Democratic candidates moved right, embracing additional funding for border enforcement, and less welcoming rhetoric on immigration.\nIt didn’t work. Post-election surveys and analyses all tend to find that aside from the economy, voters most concerned about immigration and the border sided with Trump over Harris. And some signs suggest this problem is lingering for Democrats.\n“People still don’t trust Democrats on this issue,” Tré Easton, vice president for public policy at the newly launched center-left think tank Searchlight, told me, describing the common view among some on the center-left of the party that the Biden administration immigration policy ended up being an overcorrection to Trump’s first term. This camp of the coalition also views a focus on immigration politics in general (as opposed to tariffs, prices, or health care) as a risk for Democrats because of their unpopularity.\nSome public data supports this stance: recent polls finding declines in Trump’s approval ratings or dissatisfaction with the status quo on immigration and the economy do not show the public siding with Democrats on these policies. \nThe most recent Washington Post/Ipsos poll from mid-September, for example, shows a 17 percentage point advantage for Republicans among registered voters when they’re asked which party they trust would do a better job in handling immigration. Forty-six percent of these voters trust the GOP, 29 percent trust the Democrats, and 24 percent say they distrust both parties.\nThe result is a hangover of 2020 and 2024: fear of too directly engaging ICE and Trump’s immigration policy, wariness of embracing too positive a message or position on immigration, and a desire to take border security and enforcement concerns seriously, while focusing on the kitchen-table issues that many Democratic leaders think they need more credibility to win back the working class and future elections.\nWhy some Democrats are itching for a fight \nICE is probably the most visible arm of the Trump administration’s growing executive power in this second term: Images of masked federal agents, aggressively detaining and manhandling people, are now commonplace. \nIt’s led to some Democratic elected officials seeming more comfortable in joining liberal activists in protesting the agency, calling out ICE as a “secret police” force that is “disappearing” people suspected of being in the country without documentation, and trying to conduct more oversight of the agency with the limited powers they have, over the last few months.\n\"“ICE is not suddenly going to become more popular as it multiplies the atrocities it commits around the country. … And politicians right now that are refusing to stand up are going to look like they’re not leaders.”\" - Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of Indivisible\nMeanwhile, polls show Americans are turning on Trump’s immigration policy and warming toward immigration in general (especially Democrats). Democratic outrage at ICE specifically is growing. One recent analysis from CNN’s Aaron Blake found that ICE is now even more unpopular than it was during Trump’s first term, when progressive calls to “Abolish ICE” first picked up.\nICE is also playing a bigger role in progressives’ pushback to party leaders to be more confrontational. “No Kings” protests being organized by grassroots groups for later this month are planning to center ICE and Trump’s use of the National Guard and federal agencies as a “secret police” in American cities as a rallying cry against Trump’s “authoritarian” turn, for example.\n“People are seeing what a mass deportation agenda looks like in real life…and [Democrats] are seeing what a police state looks like,” Vanessa Cardenas, the executive director of the pro-immigrant advocacy group America’s Voice, told me. “They can speak up and denounce what’s happening…but this is an opportunity for Democrats to take positions that, yes, call out the extreme tactics that ICE is deploying and present alternative ways, but don’t just allocate billions of dollars to the enforcement machine in this country.”\nThis fervor fits a recurring theme over the last few months: an anger from the progressive and liberal base that has been consuming the party over its perceived inability to resist Trump, obstruct his agenda, or “do something” as the White House takes an authoritarian turn.\n“Things are bad now, and things are going to get much worse, and the question for politicians proposing that they’re the ones to lead into the future, [is] going to be to contend with that reality,” Ezra Levin, a co-founder and co-executive director of the progressive activist network Indivisible, told me. “ICE is not suddenly going to become more popular as it multiplies the atrocities it commits around the country. It’s only going to become less popular. And politicians right now that are refusing to stand up are going to look like they’re not leaders. It’s going to look like they’re followers, because they are. It’s an untenable position and it’s just going to become ridiculous pretty soon.”\nSo far Democratic resistance has meant a handful of protests at ICE offices or facilities by some within the party, visits by congressional delegations to detention centers, and statements and social media posts condemning agents’ mask-wearing and frequent lack of identification. \nIt’s not yet the kind of political risk some want them to take: Over the summer Axios reported that Democratic lawmakers were hearing demands from their constituents that they “fight dirty” and “not be afraid to get hurt” — including to be “willing to get shot” when visiting ICE facilities. That kind of escalation is starting, as ICE tackles bystanders, tear-gasses Democratic candidates, and arrests Democratic lawmakers.\nCombined with the sheer amount of money that ICE is just starting to receive, the pressure for more Democrats to call out ICE abuses and pledge to do something about the agency will only grow, various activists and progressives told me. After the passage of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, ICE is set to receive more than $75 billion in funding over the next four years; its funding boost this year is already essentially triple its annual budget, and it’s earmarked primarily for these mass deportation efforts.\nThis all sets up two coming tests for Democrats striving to lead their party: to take the anti-ICE stance that many in the base are calling for during primaries and races in the 2026 midterms, and to stake out that ground in the future run-up to the 2028 Democratic primaries.\n“I do not think any Democrat in a competitive primary [in 2026] should win that primary unless they commit to using the full power of a future Democratic Senate majority or House majority to provide oversight of these out-of-control federal agencies,” Levin said.\nThat’s likely to create some tension with those in the coalition who have been calling for the party to moderate, pick out other liabilities for the GOP (like on the economy, tariffs, affordability, and health care), and seriously engage immigration concerns that rose among the public during the Biden years.\n“It’s coming — it’s going to be the hand-raising [on the debate stage] all over again,” Easton told me, referencing the infamous moment in the 2020 Democratic primary debates when presidential candidates pledged to decriminalize border crossings should they be elected. “But the thing is: Democrats should not mistake Trump losing support…as that being that Democrats are credible on this issue.”\nThe specter of another overcorrection looms\nAs this pressure from the party’s faithful builds, it will likely tear open another split within the coalition that has been fraying since 2024: the debate over the direction the party should take as it rebuilds.\n“The images are not great, and we’re seeing visceral responses to that. …The Democratic base, depending on who or what that means — there’s a desire to showcase action. People want to see things happening,” Easton told me. “It’s absolutely going to become an issue,” he said, but emphasized it would be a misread to move too far to the left since “people still don’t trust Democrats on this issue.”\nIt’s obviously too early to tell whether calls for stronger anti-ICE posturing by Democrats — including potential calls to defund or abolish the organization in coming years — result in a similar Biden-era overcorrection, but this tension will build.\n“People feel very burned by Biden’s overcorrection on immigration, and Democrats [in leadership] are still super aware that this is a salient issue,” Easton said. “[There’s a recognition that] as bad as Trump policies are, there cannot be a reversion to…not enforcing the law.”\nEven some who are advocating for immigrant rights and stronger Democratic resistance concede this. Cardenas, for example, told me embracing the 2018-2020 era progressive calls for “abolishing” ICE would be foolhardy. \n“Defunding” or “abolishing” are certainly catchy slogans, she told me, but Democrats should offer actual plans that balance real concerns about security and law enforcement, while also reforming the current system, instead of potentially muddling impressions of what the party stands for.\nEaston struck a similar note: Those phrases and campaigns from the peak-woke, pre-Trump 2.0 era would worsen the problem of trust. “When you say things like ‘defund’ ICE or ‘abolish’ ICE — people who are not online hear that you are not for immigration enforcement. It can be true that they need to be gutted or reformed or restructured, but Democrats need to understand that they are not trusted — it sounds like you are calling for lawlessness.”\nThe coming months may end up seeing Democrats debate and craft solutions or proposals that strike this middle ground. Some, including those in the party’s New Democrats Coalition in Congress, are already offering suggestions. \nBut as ICE actions continue to gain attention, Democratic lawmakers ramp up confrontation, and the agency receives more funding and discretion to operate across the country — it launched more show-of-force and enforcement operations in Chicago over the weekend — one side will probably have most of the momentum.","summary":"When a shooter opened fire on an immigration facility in Dallas last week, killing at least one migrant detainee in the process, it fit into a recent pattern of escalating tension — and violence — that has increasingly defined President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

They wanted to block Congress from certifying Biden’s win.\n\nFree Speech Violation? \n\nLegal experts have seen Trump’s claims against the tech giants as shaky at best, noting that the First Amendment of the US Constitution bars the government, but not a private actor, from restricting speech.\n\nYouTube “is not a state actor and its exercise of editorial discretion over its private service does not implicate Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights,” the company said in a December 2021 rebuttal to Trump’s brief.\n\nWatchdog Group Kicks\n\nJournalism watchdog group Media Matters decried the settlement, saying it portends continued First Amendment problems under Trump.\n\n“YouTube’s capitulation is shameful and shortsighted. Needlessly folding now will only help encourage Trump’s efforts to stifle dissent by bringing media and online platforms to heel,” the group’s president, Angelo Carusone, told AFP in a statement.\n\nHowever, tech and media companies have greenlighted settlements to Trump since his return to office as they await action from Washington on major matters affecting their businesses.\n\nBig questions facing YouTube and Google/Alphabet include a trial in Virginia in which a federal court is weighing a request from government lawyers to order the breakup of the search engine giant’s ad technology business.\n\nIn February, Elon Musk’s X settled for about $10 million in a Trump lawsuit against the company and its former chief executive, Jack Dorsey.\n\nIn January, days after Trump’s inauguration, Meta agreed to pay $25 million to settle his complaint, with $22 million of the payment going toward funding his future presidential library.\n\nMedia companies have also agreed to settlements with Trump in cases brought by the president that experts see as legally dodgy.\n\nFor example, Paramount Global agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Trump over an interview with former vice president Kamala Harris that Trump claimed was edited unfairly.

This column recently discussed a pending Supreme Court case that could strike down the Voting Rights Act’s remedy of creating majority-minority districts and result in the creation of even more Republican House seats.\n\nHowever, none of these actions affect presidential elections, which are decided in the Electoral College. Electoral College votes reflect the total number of House seats a state has, as determined by the census, conducted every ten years. The next census, which will take place in 2030, will award some states more House seats and take away House seats from others, based on the gains and losses of the population of each state.\n\nSo the 2028 presidential election will not be affected by any new census count, but the 2032 presidential election will. Based on a close look at population trends, the upcoming census will not bring good news for the Democrats. \n\nDonald Trump is clearly underwater in the polls, with somewhere between 43 percent and 47 percent of Americans approving of his presidency, although his approval ratings during his first administration were often below that level. Moreover, many who voted for him in 2024 on key matters related to the economy disapprove of his handling of these pocketbook issues. Against this backdrop, many Democrats believe Trump is a uniquely charismatic politician and that any successor to his MAGA movement would have a much harder time attracting independent working-class voters.\n\nCHICAGO, ILLINOIS – AUGUST 22: Attendees celebrate with balloons after Democratic presidential nominee, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic presidential nomination during the final day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on August 22, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nYet, according to a recent study by Esri, a population projection firm, assessing current population trends, it appears that over the next several years red states are going to gain Electoral College votes, blue states will lose Electoral College votes, and it will take a higher number of swing-state victories for the Democrats to win the presidency. \n\nOf the 50 states, only seven currently reside in the swing state column—Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan are often viewed as the most key, followed by Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, and Arizona. In 2024, Donald Trump won all of those states. Therefore, any population shifts that require Democrats to win more of these states obviously increase their challenge. \n\nIn the 2024 race, if Kamala Harris had been able to win Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, she would have won the presidency with an Electoral College victory of 270 to 268. However, the Esri study suggests that in 2032 even if the Democrats were to win those three swing states the Republicans would end up with a 16-vote Electoral College margin of 277 to 261. That is a major change in Electoral College math.\n\nOngoing population shifts suggest Texas will be picking up three Electoral College votes, Florida two, Utah one, and Idaho one. Conversely, California would lose three Electoral College votes; Illinois would lose two, and New York and Rhode Island would each lose one. Even if a new census were held today, population changes since 2020 would mean red states gain five electoral votes and blue states would lose five. Moreover, Pennsylvania and Democratic-leaning Minnesota would each lose one, while swing states Arizona and Georgia would each gain one. \n\nIn other words, in addition to needing to win Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, Democrats would also have to win at least one of the key Sun Belt states of Georgia, North Carolina, or Arizona. \n\nWhat does this mean for the Democratic Party, which is itself deeply underwater in the polls and even less popular than President Trump? It clearly means it is more important than ever for the party to rebuild itself with an eye towards centrism—appealing to independent swing-state voters who have clearly showed a willingness to embrace Trumpism and will be unlikely to be won back by left-wing candidates.\n\nIt is simply undeniable that if the Electoral College math is going to get significantly more difficult for the Democrats, the party has to be attractive to independent voters in the key swing states—they cannot allow the left wing of the party to drive their national identity. This is a key reason that the looming election of Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York would create a major albatross around the neck of the party as it attempts to build a more centrist identity. \n\nIt is ve...","summary":"Democrats had better stop assuming that when Trump is gone the political winds will naturally shift back to them.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-electoral-college-math-getting-harder-opinion-10800308","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2167987624.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-30 10:00:00","author":"Tom Rogers","authors":["Tom Rogers"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.066},{"id":364804408,"title":"What Does Kamala Harris’ Memoir Have to Teach Us About Trump? Funny You Ask.","text":"What is Kamala Harris’ new book, 107 Days, supposed to be exactly? Is it a memoir about her historically short campaign against the most formidable Republican candidate since the Gipper? Is it an apology for losing that election and changing the course of American history? Or is it a warning to other political candidates that neoliberalism is no longer a winning strategy for the Democrats, and to restrategize while we still have free and fair elections?\n\nMan, I don’t know. I read it when it was released last week, and I’m still stuck on a detail about how one of the most powerful women in the world was batch-freezing home-cooked meals so that her adult husband would have something to eat while she worked as the vice president of the United States. What a scene to set a mere 39 pages into her book: Harris is playing Border Czar and Doug Emhoff is defrosting vegetarian chili in an old microwave.\n\n Slate receives a commission when you purchase items using the links on this page.\n Thank you for your support.\n\nIt’s not surprising Harris would write a book about her uniquely hamstrung campaign and her gutting, history-defining loss. Hillary Clinton did something similar after she lost in 2016 with her book, What Happened. But Clinton’s book came out when we were collectively still stunned at the prospect of a Trump presidency. Harris’ book is being released into a world where everyone knows exactly what’s happening, but no one really knows what to do about it. Harris, it seems, has no real answers either. “I wanted a seat at the table. I wanted to make change from inside the system,” she writes. “Today I’m no longer sure about that.”\n\nIf you plug your ears and cover your eyes and scream as loud as possible, you can read much of the book as if you live in a world where Harris won. Nearly every chapter is but one day of her campaign, and several of them end with motivational pablum. On Day 106, she leads a crowd in a rallying cry that when we fight, “we win!” But “we” lost, quite famously, didn’t we! Such is the key trouble with 107 Days, and books like it, where the politician author is unable or unwilling to adjudicate their own failings. What’s the point of reading about a political failure if there’s nothing to learn from it for our shaky future?\n\nThe book spans her entire campaign, but it’s mostly over by the time she loses and certifies Trump’s reelection. Because the book is in a daily diary format, there’s no room for introspection or hindsight; instead, we’re left with little details about debate prep and Biden gaffes. A more interesting book starts at her loss, instead of leading us through the heady campaign that, frankly, doesn’t matter anymore. The despair of living through this Trump term makes it clear how little her campaign mattered: the little decisions around ads, around slogans, around debate sound bites. If she doesn’t have a vision for the political path forward, the least she could do is tell us what it feels like for her to watch the carnage unfold.\n\nBut that’s not the book Harris wrote. Instead, she leans into the same half-hearted rhetoric that lost her the election in the first place. She says she was merely “ambivalent” about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and then offers this literary pivot of the century: “What I’m not ambivalent about is Israel’s security.” It’s a laughable sentiment even in Israel, where many locals want an immediate military de-escalation. This MFA-dropout prose reads like snippets from a Veep episode deemed too inglorious for even Selina Meyer.\n\nIt’s impossible to read 107 Days without looking for mentions of Gaza, or specifically, for Harris to recognize how much her campaign suffered for its tacit support of the genocide. Still, you won’t find her recognizing that perhaps a more strident support of Palestinian people would have won her more Arab American votes. “For any enduring peace, we have to let go of extreme rhetoric on both sides,” she writes. “I wanted to acknowledge the complexity, nuance, and history of the region, but it seemed very few people had the appetite for that or the willingness to hold two tragic narratives in their mind at the same time, to grieve for human suffering both Israeli and Palestinian.” The blame is placed squarely on the protester or the voter—or, as was her problem ultimately, the nonvoter.\n\nIt’s details like this that Harris wants to hide in the folds of schlocky writing. It works only if you haven’t been paying attention for the past few years. Harris writes about a moment a few days into her campaign, where she spoke to the press about Gaza: “To everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire and to everyone who yearns for peace, I see you and I hear you. Let’s get the deal done.” It sounds nice, if you’re under some impression that this impassioned speech led to any kind of deal at all. Very West Wing!\n\nIf you’re looking for a clear villain in 107 Days, the closest you get might be Dr. Jill Biden. She’s written about sparingly but only as the overprotective, sometimes insulting first lady who was blinded by her need to protect her husband’s political memory. There are very few real revelations in the book, but one small one is Harris’ husband losing his temper after Dr. Biden asked if he and Harris were still loyal to them. “They hide you away for four years, give you impossible, shit jobs, don’t correct the record when those tasks are mischaracterized, never fight back when you’re attacked, never praise your accomplishments,” he said. “And still, they have to ask if we’re loyal?” It’s a great question left unanswered by the book, and by Harris’ own political ideology. Loyal to who: party, country, or political iconoclast?\n\nAs with most projects after a failed election bid, 107 Days is mostly preoccupied with protecting Harris’ legacy, and by extension, the Democrats. She seems quietly radicalized by her loss, though more into seeking different employment, not in a way that’s changed her core beliefs about the party she dedicated much of her life to. She knows that the strategy set before her by Biden’s camp, and then by her own team, failed; she seems unwilling to admit that she was responsible for so much of that failure.\n\nThe ultimate thesis of 107 Days is similar to what Harris told Stephen Colbert on The Late Show last month: “I don’t want to go back in the system. I think it’s broken.” She isn’t seeking reelection and instead wants to “talk with people and I don’t want it to be transactional where I’m asking for their vote.”\n\nShe’s right, but she’s late. Harris comes to the conclusion that the system is broken only when her efforts to ascend to its highest reaches are fully rejected. It’s only through her own ambition that she sees the flaw in the design of America: She was good and smart and charming and beautiful and it still wasn’t enough. But in the same interview, Colbert asks her who the new leaders of the Democrats are, and Harris refuses to give a name—she doesn’t even mention Zohran Mamdani, the socialist candidate for mayor in New York and target of Trump’s ire, to whom she’s only given a lukewarm endorsement.\n\nMonths after her loss, Harris still makes the same mistakes about what she thinks Americans want. Maybe she doesn’t actually understand where she got it all wrong, and seeking insight from her is a futile mission. There’s always something to learn from history’s losers, but not if they’re still invested in their own myth-making.","summary":"The most consequential loser of the 21st century has written a memoir.","url":"https://slate.com/culture/2025/09/kamala-harris-book-trump-biden-107-days.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/47821ac6-1336-4d1c-b9f7-1003a06ad8fa.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-30 09:40:00","author":"Scaachi Koul","authors":["Scaachi Koul"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":364858396,"title":"Senators Draft Plan to Curb Hidden L-1 Visa Migration Program","text":"A bipartisan duo in the Senate has drafted an unprecedented bill to curb the little-known but huge L-1 visa program, which allows multinationals to import hundreds of thousands of white collar workers while paying them home country wages.\n\nThe L-1 reform is combined with a reform of the H-1B visa, which keeps roughly one million foreign white collar workers in the Fortune 500 jobs that are needed by skilled American graduates and innovative professionals.\n\n“Congress created the H-1B and L-1 visa programs as limited pathways for businesses to acquire top talent when it can’t be found at home,” said a Monday statement from Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He added:\n\nOver the years, many employers have used them to cut out American workers in favor of cheap foreign labor. Congress must step in again to bring integrity back to these programs and restore dignity for American and foreign workers. There’s bipartisan acknowledgement that these programs ought to be returned to their intended purpose. Our bill would make that shared goal a reality.”\n\n“Major companies are laying off thousands of American workers while filing thousands of visa petitions for foreign workers at depressed wages and poor working conditions,” said a statement from Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL), the top-ranking Democrat on the judiciary committee. “Congress must step in to protect American workers and fix our broken immigration system.”\n\nThe bill sets new wage rules, time limits, and approval procedures for L-1 visa and H-1B workers.\n\nThe move is backed by a bipartisan, left-to-right alliance of Sens. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Bernie Sanders (I-VT).\n\nAmericans are increasingly recognizing the damage done by the various programs, said Rosemary Jenks, cofounder and policy director of the Immigration Accountability Project. Tech professionals are “definitely speaking up… they’re coming out of the woodwork,” she told Breitbart News.\n\nThe L-1 Visa Program\n\nThe L-1 program receives almost no coverage in the mainstream media, partly because the federal government provides limited information about its scope and impact.\n\nIt allows multinational companies to import skilled workers and managers if their claim to have “specialized knowledge” is approved by embassy officials. Those permissions were readily granted under President Joe Biden. Companies also used to win “blanket visas” to import many migrants with minimal review by the embassies.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2023, the U.S. embassy in India approved L visas for at least 176,006 people, including the children and working spouses of the L-1 workers.\n\nHowever, Donald Trump’s deputies are now restricting the award of L-1 visas.\n\nIn theory, the program was established to help international companies set up operations in other countries, for example, setting up production lines or complex machines. But that useful goal is often disregarded by companies when embassy officials are under orders to let more L-1a employees and L-1b managers.\n\nThe program is now mostly used by Indian outsourcing companies to import very cheap workers for U.S. contracts, and to reward favored employees with the promise of fast-track green cards and U.S. citizenship.\n\n“The L-1 visa is largely a black box,” said a May report by the AFL-CIO’s Department for Professional Employees. “There is no publicly available data showing how much L-1 workers are paid or the duration of their stays,” said the report, which estimated the L-1 workforce to be roughly 315,000 foreign workers.\n\nThe workforce is large because the L-1 migrants can stay for 5 or 7 years. This means that many foreigners have a huge incentive to pay their foreign managers for L-1 visas in the hope of migrating to the United States.\n\nThe report noted:\n\nFor example, in late 2013, tech company Electronics for Imaging was fined by DOL and ordered to pay back wages to nonimmigrant workers who were paid just $1.21 per hour to work 120 hours per week installing computer systems in California. The employees were likely on L-1 visas. Since there is no prevailing wage requirement, the company was only required to pay its foreign employees the state minimum wage\n\nThe business-backed Cato Institute, unsurprisingly, defends the wage-cutting outsourcing program: “Eliminating the L‑1 visa program would harm job and [total] wage growth in the United States by making it much more difficult to expand businesses here.”\n\nMany of the imported L-1 workers work alongside the roughly 750,000 H-1B workers, plus roughly 250,000 spouses of H-1B workers, and at least 200.000 recent foreign graduates of U.S. universities.\n\nThe L-1 reform bill joins the rush of other reform plans being pushed by Sen. Jim Banks (R-OH), Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO), Grassley, and by President Donald Trump.\n\n“The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security,” said a September 19 proclamation by Trump establishing modest curbs on the H-1B program:\n\nThe number of foreign STEM workers in the United States has more than doubled between 2000 and 2019, increasing from 1.2 million to almost 2.5 million, while overall STEM employment has only increased 44.5 percent during that time. Among computer and math occupations, the foreign share of the workforce grew from 17.7 percent in 2000 to 26.1 percent in 2019. And the key facilitator for this influx of foreign STEM labor has been the abuse of the H-1B visa.\n\nThe abuse of the H-1B program is also a national security threat. Domestic law enforcement agencies have identified and investigated H-1B-reliant outsourcing companies for engaging in visa fraud, conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and other illicit activities to encourage foreign workers to come to the United States.\n\nThe Christian Science Monitor reported in June:\n\nIn a recent Tallo survey of more than 2,000 people ages 18 to 30, 62% of respondents said that they were not working in a field that they intended to … Additionally, the same survey found that 1 in 4 said that they couldn’t find a job in their intended field.\n\nBloomberg News reported on September 29:\n\nIt’s not just recent college graduates who are struggling to find entry-level positions. Out-of-work mid-career employees are taking part-time jobs, and hiring has stalled in industries from professional services to manufacturing. More than a quarter of the jobless have been out of work more than a half-year — the highest share since the mid-2010s excluding the pandemic-era years.\n\nIndustry leaders blame the tight job market in Artificial Intelligence technology, but that technology has had little impact on job numbers so far.\n\nInstead, critics of the visa worker programs say early-career job opportunities are being blocked off by the huge flood of visa workers, mostly from India. The migrants are eager to take any job at low wages, because life in the United States is better than back in India, and every job offers the hope of getting a green card.\n\nIn February, Bloomberg reported on a lawsuit that claimed that many L-1 workers were improperly imported by an Indian-run subcontractor for Fortune 500 companies. The lawsuit was filed by Anil Kini, who was brought to the United States to manage other Indian workers doing tasks subcontracted by Denver-based Western Union Co., Bloomberg reported:\n\nKini supervised 37 employees. All but two of his team were from India, and they had replaced Western Union’s previous [American] staff, according to Kini … In all, Kini said that of the 22 L-1A visa employees on the Western Union account, only eight performed managerial roles [as required by the visa].\n\nThe lawsuits described by Bloomberg say that executives directed low-level managers to justify the L-1A visa requests by claiming the requested ordinary Indian workers were actually managers:\n\nIndian national Vinod Govindharajan says that TCS obtained his L-1A visa in 2013 by falsely stating on his visa application that he was a manager in a business development role when in fact he had no subordinates. He says that securing his L-1A visa allowed the company to circumvent tighter H-1B rules and bring him to Edison, New Jersey, where he alleges he was paid half of what his US counterparts in the same job made. Angry at TCS and struggling to pay his bills, he filed a complaint in 2018 with the EEOC, which enforces federal laws prohibiting workplace discrimination.\nThe EEOC investigated the matter and found “credible documentary evidence” that TCS “frequently falsifies documents in support of L-1 visa applications,” according to a “final determination” letter the agency sent to Govindharajan, his attorney and TCS in 2019. The letter also said the agency determined visa workers from India are paid at much lower rates than their American colleagues, and that TCS had retaliated against Govindharajan for raising his concerns.\n\nMany critics say the “AI” threat cited by corporate executives actually refers to “All Indian.”\n\nA recent survey showed that a large majority of Democrat-leaning tech professionals see the H-1B visa program as a threat to their careers. The survey reported 56 percent of the Americans polled said “they view H-1B visa holders as direct competitors for jobs.” Sixty percent of U.S. citizens said that “U.S. citizens and green card holders should be given hiring priority.”\n\nBut the vast white-collar migration has already pushed millions of American graduates out of white-collar jobs, so contributing to Kamala Harris’ defeat in 2024. A February 10 article in the Washington Post outlined one example of a displaced American software manager who is learning to become a farmer:\n\nSince being laid off from Indeed last year, [Daelynn] Moyer has applied to more than 140 jobs but received no offers. She and her wife are considering selling their house near Portland, Oregon, and buying land to farm instead — worried whatever job she finds won’t cover her mortgage. “It would be a meager existence, but it would be fulfilling,” Moyer said.\n\n“Eliot Lee, 52, a project manager at a Utah software company, said after losing his job [that] Recruiters told him they would often receive more than 1,000 applications for a single position,” the Post added.\n\nSo far, Trump and his deputies are zig-zagging towards an industrial polices that downplays immigration and promotes the alternative policy of reliance on skilled American citizens, automation, robots, and trade.\n\n“We’re going to need robots … to make our economy run because we do not have enough people,” he told Breitbart News. “So we have to get efficient … we’ll probably add to [the existing workforce] through robotically—it’s going to be robotically … Then somebody is going to have to make the robots. The whole thing, it feeds on itself .”\n\nThe promise of cheap labor is ” a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vice President JD Vance told an audience of Silicon Valley investors in May. He added:\n\nAnd whether we’re offshoring factories to cheap labor economies or importing cheap labor through our immigration system, cheap labor became the drug of Western economies. And I’d say that if you look in nearly every country, from Canada to the UK that imported large amounts of cheap labor, you’ve seen productivity stagnate.\n\n“That’s not a total happenstance — think that the connection is very direct,” Vance added.","summary":"A bipartisan duo in the Senate has drafted an unprecedented bill to curb the little-known but huge L-1 visa program, which allows multinationals to import hundreds of thousands of white collar workers while paying them home country wages.\n\n\nThe post Senators Draft Plan to Curb Hidden L-1 Visa Migration Program appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/09/30/senators-draft-plan-to-curb-hidden-l-1-visa-migration-program/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/09/american-visa-arrival-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-30 09:32:10","author":"Neil Munro","authors":["Neil Munro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.135},{"id":364794872,"title":"Gen Z women say ‘no thanks’ to motherhood. Reasons range from practical to spiritual.","text":"There’s a “boy internet” and a “girl internet.” And the two exist separately. That’s what Marianna Pecora, a student majoring in political communication, jokes about with her friends. “I think it’s dangerous for our society in general to have such a wide gap between genders.”\n\nThe disconnect that Ms. Pecora and her friends have identified in social media feeds mirrors disconnects in surveys of Generation Z. In a recent NBC News poll, only 6% of young women who voted for then-Vice President Kamala Harris say they prioritize having children. That compares with 34% percent of young men who voted for President Donald Trump who say children are a top priority.\n\nThe polling highlights an aspect of today’s culture wars: the growing ideological rift between conservative young men and liberal young women, divided by views of politics and religion. These young women are also moving away from organized religion in greater numbers than prior generations. Often, that is a rejection of gendered roles that some churches, particularly evangelical ones, impose on them, says Katie Gaddini, a sociologist who studies women in religious spaces. Many who leave church chafe at religious leaders who describe the role of a woman as being a mother at home, not also as being a working professional.\n\n“The way that we treat women in society has real and tangible impacts,” says Ms. Pecora, a senior at George Washington University. “When you’re talking about women in such a belittling way, it’s going to close off at least a certain segment of them.”\n\nGen Z women say having children is a complicated choice – and one that relies on a financial stability that feels difficult to achieve for their generation.\n\nThe surveys showing differing priorities held by young women and men in opposite parties aren’t emerging in a vacuum. After Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, women on the left, and that is a majority of Gen Z women, have expressed concern that more of their rights could fall.\n\n“On the political right and in the ‘manosphere,’ there is an attempt to hearken back to more traditional gender roles,” says Melissa Deckman, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute.\n\nThe larger question is whether those ideas appeal to younger Americans, especially women, says Ms. Deckman. She doesn’t see convincing evidence that they broadly do.\n\nWhen views on the fringes become more mainstream\n\nThere has long been a segment of American Christians who question the legal rights of women, from access to birth control to no-fault divorce to the 19th Amendment. What’s changed is that many people representing those views hold prominent positions in the Trump administration, bringing into the mainstream views that were once held on the fringes. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared a video in which the leader of the church he attends said women shouldn’t have the right to vote independently of their husbands.\n\nThat pastor and theologian, Doug Wilson, has referred to women in crude and expletive-laden language, argued that sexism has virtues, and said that a woman’s biblical duty is to submit to her husband.\n\n“Women are the kind of people that people come out of,” said Pastor Wilson in the CNN interview. “The wife and mother, who is the chief executive of the home, is entrusted with three or four or five eternal souls.”\n\nThat view of motherhood and helpmeet as the sole purpose of women, though not of the majority in Christian circles, has increasingly entered political conversations. In 2021, former Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn referred to women as “earthen vessels” in a speech on the House floor.\n\nYoung women who spoke with the Monitor seem acutely aware of how recently women won rights such as holding a credit card in their own name, or when marital rape was recognized in court (both were in the 1970s). Today, young women outpace young men in higher education, making up 53% of the college-educated workforce.\n\n“There’s this real bifurcation happening and these kinds of extreme reactions with Gen Z women, even though the majority of them are moving more to the left,” says Dr. Gaddini, whose research has focused on both young women who leave churches and women on the Christian right.\n\nThat creates a tension with political leaders who want to see an emphasis on the nuclear family. Birth rates in America have been declining for nearly two decades, falling to 1.6 this year. That’s well below the replacement rate of 2.1.\n\nSome women also see divides with Gen Z men who say they prize having a family but don’t treat women as equals. Though tension around women’s rights is not new, the gender divide among Gen Z has intensified with the rise of influencers like self-proclaimed “misogynist” Andrew Tate. Mr. Tate has been charged with rape and human trafficking in Romania and the United Kingdom. He denies the charges.\n\n“I think that the average man treats women very poorly and it’s so core to the way that young men are taught to behave,” says Emily, who declined to give her last name because she works in government. “Putting women down is such a tool for power in men’s playbook.”\n\nAfter backing Joe Biden in 2020, Gen Z men turned out for Mr. Trump in 2024 – something the president credits a great portion of to Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist who was fatally shot. Mr. Kirk, alongside his wife, Erika Kirk, emphasized what the pair described as a traditional marriage based on biblical values.\n\nSo far, young men are not joining churches in droves. They’re simply staying put. Young women, meanwhile, are heading for the exits in greater numbers.\n\nPolitically, 58% of young women lean Democratic, while 52% of young men lean Republican. And of course, women are unlikely to decide whether to have children based on what politicians say. But many young women interviewed say that leaders’ statements about women don’t make them feel as though barriers to having children, like inadequate and expensive health care and child care, will improve.\n\nIn the first months of Mr. Trump’s second term, religious statements and values have been thrust into the spotlight in new ways, including discussion about family structures. Comments from prominent political figures in the Trump administration have echoed ideas formerly expressed mostly in the online “manosphere.”\n\nRecently, Mr. Trump himself seemed to question whether domestic violence is a crime, while speaking at an event about religious liberty at the Museum of the Bible in Washington. “Things that take place in the home they call crime,” he said. “If a man has a little fight with the wife, they say, ‘This was a crime.’”\n\nDebating cultural and Christian principles\n\nThe opposition to certain rights for women and to women in leadership roles in churches and other institutions is discouraging, says Robbie Cansler, lead pastor of The Mission Church of the Nazarene.\n\nBut opposition to women holding authority isn’t based on Christian principles, in her view. “They’re cultural principles that are being imposed,” she says.\n\nThe ideas often spread quickly online in a “real, scary phenomenon” known as rage bait, says Emily. “I think that at its core, a lot of Western society is built on the idea that women are subservient to men.”\n\nIn her own church, Pastor Cansler says the theological statement is pro-women. Only about 14% of lead pastors in the denomination are women, despite making up about half of all those ordained.\n\nPastor Cansler is examining that disconnect in her dissertation. “I think God is speaking to women,” she says. “But then the power holders, which tend to be white men and white middle-aged men ... they feel that power shift. And I don’t think they like that.”\n\nBeyond restrictive ideas about women’s roles in society, for many women, the question of whether to start a family comes down to one thing: expense.\n\n“Really, what it comes down to is being wealthy enough to raise a kid,” says Emily.\n\nAnother “looming fear” is access to reproductive care, and concern that a woman’s health won’t be prioritized if something goes wrong in pregnancy.\n\nAnd then, there are the cultural disconnects, says Ms. Pecora, the student. “I don’t want to have kids with any guy that’s talking about women like that.”","summary":"Polls show young liberal women prioritize financial independence, while young conservative men prioritize children.

In response, we will need to demonstrate that we are a partner willing to take tough decisions to protect the North American integrated market and to defend our interests.”\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 30, 2025.","summary":"Advisers suggested he remind Harris of their most recent meeting at a conference in Pennsylvania the previous May.","url":"https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/a-glimpse-of-trudeaus-congratulatory-call-that-might-have-been-to-kamala-harris/article_07ac62b2-f8b5-5b86-ad59-d0508f050e93.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/70/070e4982-432d-4abe-a5b1-bcff81300c42/68dbb8b07b3a1.image.jpg?crop=1400%2C735%2C0%2C99&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-30 08:00:00","author":"Jim Bronskill The Canadian Press","authors":["Jim Bronskill The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.282},{"id":364759850,"title":"YouTube, Trump’ın açtığı davada 24,5 milyon dolar ödemeyi kabul etti","text":"ABD Başkanı Donald Trump'ın, hesabının kapatılması nedeniyle 2021'de YouTube'a karşı açtığı davada 24,5 milyon dolarlık uzlaşmaya gidildi.\n\nTrump'ın 6 Ocak 2021 Kongre baskınının ardından hesabını askıya alması nedeniyle aynı yıl YouTube'a açtığı davada karara varıldı.\n\nWall Street Journal gazetesinin mahkeme belgelerine dayandırdığı haberine göre, YouTube'un ödeyeceği 24,5 milyon doların 22 milyonu Trump'a aktarılacak.\n\nKalan 2,5 milyon dolar ise yazar Naomi Wolf ve Amerikan Muhafazakar Birliği (ACU) dahil diğer davacılara dağıtılacak.\n\nTrump'ın medya ve teknoloji devleriyle davaları\n\nABC News, Aralık 2024'te Trump'a yönelik iftira davasında 15 milyon dolar tazminat ödeyeceğini açıklamıştı.\n\nTrump, Aralık 2024'te \"60 Minutes\" programında Demokrat rakibi Kamala Harris ile yapılan mülakatını yanıltıcı şekilde düzenlediği suçlamasıyla CBS News televizyonuna 20 milyar dolarlık tazminat davası açmıştı.

It’s dangerous, worse than race car drivers and bull riders,” Trump told Harris. “It’s very nice that you called, and I appreciate it. You’ve done a great job, you really have. You’ve done a very, very good job … my only problem is it makes it very hard for me to be angry at you. It’s like, what am I going to do?

During a recent appearance, the president had his audience laughing as he explained his preferred way of pronouncing the name of the agreements, which were brokered under his first term.“Abrah-ahm Accords. I like to say it that way because the REAL people call it ‘Abrah-ahm.’ I would say ‘Abraham.’ But it’s so much nicer when you say ‘Abrah-ahm.’ So much more elegant. The Abrah-ahm Accords…” Trump said, drawing laughter from the crowd.The comment came after Trump’s meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, where the pair discussed Iran, the Gaza conflict and prospects for regional peace. Trump has repeatedly suggested that Iran could eventually join the accords, despite decades of hostility between Tehran and Israel. “Who knows, maybe even Iran can get in there,” he said, with Netanyahu by his side.The Abraham Accords, signed in 2020, normalised relations between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and later Morocco. Trump has sought to expand the framework, even as critics argue that the agreements have not addressed the core issue of Palestinian statehood. Netanyahu, too, has publicly rejected the idea of a Palestinian state, though he has supported Washington’s latest peace proposal for Gaza, which includes a ceasefire and international oversight.Trump’s offbeat remarks about pronunciation are nothing new. He previously admitted he long called Qatar “Cut-R” before learning the accepted usage, and in 2016, he drew attention for saying “Tan-ZAY-nee-uh” instead of Tanzania. Beyond geography, he has often coined unusual nicknames for rivals, such as “Sleepy Joe” for President Biden or, more recently, “Kamabla” for Vice President Kamala Harris.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/so-much-more-elegant-donald-trump-shows-correct-way-of-saying-abrah-ahm-watch/articleshow/124227893.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-124227898/124227898.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-30 06:39:26","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.368},{"id":364749220,"title":"Ariana Grande Shares Pretty Blunt Question For Trump Supporters","text":"Ariana Grande shared an Instagram post on Sunday that questioned how many Donald Trump voters’ lives had improved since the president returned to office.\n\nIt was a loaded question, but it begged for answers.\n\nThe Instagram story post she circulated from podcaster Matt Bernstein read:\n\n“I want to check in with Trump voters.
