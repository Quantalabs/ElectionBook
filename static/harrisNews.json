Fogerty praised Springsteen for speaking out against Trump and defending his values. \"I’m really proud of Bruce for just sticking up for his values and, and not being afraid to voice them,\" said the \"Down on the Corner\" singer. KID ROCK CALLS OUT BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN'S ANTI-TRUMP RANT ON EUROPEAN TOUR, SAYS IT WAS A 'PUNK MOVE' Springsteen has been a vocal critic of President Trump for almost a decade now. During his latest world tour, the \"Born To Run\" singer has incorporated a brief anti-Trump speech into his sets where he implores audiences to recognize the president as a threat to civilization that must be resisted. \"In my home, the America I love, the America I've written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration,\" he said in between songs at his Manchester show in May. \"Tonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experience to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring,\" he continued, elsewhere during the set adding, \"There's some very weird, strange and dangerous s--- going on out there right now.\" TRUMP CALLS SPRINGSTEEN 'HIGHLY OVERRATED' AFTER ROCKER LABELS HIM 'TREASONOUS' OVERSEAS Trump responded to Springsteen several days later in a post on his Truth Social platform. \"I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States. Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy — Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country.\" Springsteen announced last year that he would be voting for former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential race.

Head over to a Cracker Barrel because no one wants to see your arrogant presence, with your small pink arm and large belly.”\n\n‘Nobody wants to see that s**t, no one.’\n\nFans quickly criticized the interior designer, labeling her as ‘pompous and arrogant.’ One person commented, “It’s often those who are the most intolerant and hateful who pretend to care for everyone.”\n\nOthers wrote: ‘Yes listen to this elite rich white woman. \n\n‘What a pompous, arrogant thing to say.\n\n‘Uber Karen. I voted for Trump and I’m having a burrito with chorizo and spinach dip for lunch today.\n\n‘I know a lot of black, Hispanic and Indian people who voted Trump three times as well.\n\nBack in April Welch had a tense debate with former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel when he joined I’ve Had It to discuss the problems within the Democratic Party.\n\nEmanuel previously served as Chicago’s mayor from 2011 to 2019, was an adviser to President Bill Clinton, served as President Barack Obama’s chief of staff and was an ambassador to Japan under President Joe Biden. \n\nThe two Democrats struggled to find a consensus on transgender rights and their conversation quickly morphed into a tense debate, hinting at a divide that may cause trouble in 2028. \n\nThe issue has become a divisive topic across the aisle, but Republicans have seemed to find unity, while Democrats haven’t formed a consensus on how to approach transgender rights. \n\nWelch, a more progressive member of the left, laid into Emanuel during their conversation when he accused Kamala Harris of not prioritizing economic issues, noting that Democrats weren’t ‘really good about the family room issues.’ \n\n‘The only room we were doing really well was the bathroom, and that’s the smallest room in the house,’ he continued, referencing the ongoing debate about allowing transgender individuals to use the bathroom they prefer.\n\nThe comment set Welch on a tirade, and she quickly responded that his claim was, ‘total bulls**t.’\n\nEmanuel argued that transgender issues were ‘tangential,’ and not a core value on the left, to which Welch vehemently disagreed. \n\n‘I’m so sick of Democrats like you selling out and saying this. You know who talks about trans people more than anybody? MAGA. MAGA is the most genital-obsessed political party I have ever seen,’ she said. \n\nWelch argued that Harris did have a comprehensive economic plan and even referenced the vice president’s proposal to provide up to $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers. \n\nShe went on to slam Donald Trump for ‘droning on about Hannibal Lecter’ and accused Democrats of losing because they’re ‘playing the game with the rulebook’ while Republicans have ‘ripped up the rulebook.’ \n\nEmanuel then threw up his hands and pushed back, saying as mayor, he did deal with the ‘bathroom issue’ but that transgender rights were not a cornerstone of the Democratic party. \n\n‘They’re the gender-obsessed weirdos, [Republicans], not us [Democrats]. We’re the ones who fight for Social Security. We fight for Medicare, and yeah, we’re not gonna bully trans people,’ Welch argued.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA former Bravo star has been slammed after claiming &#8216;fat a**&#8217; Trump&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Bravo Celebrity Suggests Banning Trump Supporters from Mexican Restaurants first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/bravo-celebrity-suggests-banning-trump-supporters-from-mexican-restaurants/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Bravo-star-says-Trump-voters-should-be-banned-from-Mexican-restaurants.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-11 22:32:05","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.038},{"id":350211500,"title":"US protesters say Trump using ‘crime emergency’ to justify DC takeover","text":"Washington, DC – The news was met with jeers.\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump on Monday invoked a “crime emergency” in the US capital, allowing his Department of Justice to take control of Washington, DC’s local law enforcement. He simultaneously announced the Pentagon would deploy US National Guard forces to the city of more than 700,000.\n\nGathered just blocks away, with the White House looming in the background, protesters erupted in a chorus of “boos”.\n\nThe Pentagon later said 800 soldiers were activated on Monday, with 100-200 of them supporting law enforcement.\n\nTrump’s latest move, said Keya Chatterjee, the executive director of Free DC, was not just another salvo against the long marginalised rights of the residents of the city, but a “major escalation”.\n\n“This goes beyond the sort of words people have been using, like ‘unprecedented and ‘unusual,'” said Chatterjee, whose group advocates for DC self-determination.\n\n“This is just authoritarianism,” she told Al Jazeera, over the chants from the crowd.\n\n‘Represent ourselves’\n\nThe rights of the hundreds of thousands of residents of Washington, DC have been the subject of debate since it was established by Congress in 1790 with land from Maryland and Virginia.\n\nThe district continues to fall under the direct auspices of the federal government, having never been granted statehood. However, it maintains a level of local autonomy per the Home Rule Act of 1973, which allows residents to elect some local officials. Congress still reviews all legislation passed by those elected officials and approves the district’s budget.\n\nThe city’s superlative as the first Black majority city in the US, and its current status as a Black plurality city, has further added a racial dynamic to what advocates have long decried as the systematic disenfranchisement of its residents.\n\nCivil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton called the move the “ultimate affront to justice and civil rights,” in a statement.\n\n“Donald Trump was inspired to take this disgusting, dangerous, and derogatory action solely out of self interest,” Sharpton said in a statement. “Let’s call the inspiration for this assault on a majority Black city for what it is: another bid to distract his angry, frustrated base over his administration’s handling of the Epstein files.”\n\nIn March, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser agreed to rename the Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House, where Monday’s protest was held, amid pressure from Trump and concerns that federal funding could be withheld.\n\nBowser said Monday that the deployment of the National Guard was “unsettling”, but not without precedent.\n\n“My message to residents is this,” Bowser said. “We know that access to our democracy is tenuous. That is why you have heard me and many Washingtonians before me advocate for full statehood.”\n\nFor many gathered on Monday, Trump’s move again underscored how little power they had in directly influencing the policies of the local law enforcement that directly oversees their community.\n\nAmari Jack, a 20-year-old college student, described what he saw as “the first step” in a wider consolidation of power over the city, noting Trump has for years floated the idea of taking more full control of the metropolis surrounding the White House. Such a move would likely require Congress overturning the Home Rule Act.\n\n“I came out today because I was really scared about the potential that DC could lose any autonomy it has,” Jack told Al Jazeera.\n\n“I feel like as DC natives, born and raised, we need to be able to represent ourselves and enrich our communities. We can’t just have a president come in and rule over our home.”\n\nCrime as a pretext?\n\nFor his part, in an order declaring the “emergency”, Trump decried what he called the “city government’s failure to maintain public order and safety”, claiming crime rates posed “intolerable risks to the vital Federal functions that take place in the District of Columbia”.\n\nSpeaking to reporters from the White House, Trump vowed to “take our capital back”, outlining what he described as “massive enforcement operations targeting known gangs, drug dealers and criminal networks to get them the hell off the street”.\n\nTrump further claimed he was “getting rid of the slums”, and would clear homeless people from the city, without offering further details of his plans.\n\nAmong those pushing back on the characterisation was the District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who called the move “unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful.”\n\n“There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia,” he said.\n\nWhile DC crime rates are typically higher than the national average, violent crime rates have dropped significantly in recent years, plummeting 35 percent from 2023 to 2024 and another 26 percent this year compared to the same period last year, according to Metropolitan Police data.\n\nEarly this year, the Justice Department announced that violent crime in DC had hit a 30-year low.\n\nGroups like the Center for American Progress have attributed the decline to both local law enforcement strategies, as well as “investments in crime prevention and resources such as housing and education and employment supports”.\n\nTwenty-year-old Radha Tanner, like many gathered, saw Trump as using the pretext of crime to enact a wider political mission, one that paints Democrat-dominated cities like DC as “unsafe and riddled with crime”.\n\nOver 90 percent of DC voters supported Trump’s Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election. Trump, in turn, won about 6.5 percent of the vote.\n\nTanner saw Monday’s moves as in line with Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, California to aid in immigration crackdowns and the protests they spurred.\n\n“He’s doing this to make an example out of a city full of Democrats that is vulnerable because we don’t have representation,” Tanner said.\n\n‘Best place for us to resist’\n\nMaurice Carney, 60, saw a similar goal in Trump’s actions, arguing that long-term investment, not a short-term commandeering of local law enforcement or the deployment of the National Guard, would actually show a real commitment to addressing crime.\n\n“When you see this increase in militarisation, whether it’s in DC or on the African continent or anywhere else in the world, you always see an increase in violence, either from resistance or from creating an environment that’s unstable,” said Carney, who works with a DC-based group that advocates for citizens of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n“Like it or not, DC is seen as the capital of the empire, the capital of the world,” Carney told Al Jazeera. “So if Trump wants to show he’s this ‘law and order’ guy, DC is the best place for him to do that.”\n\n“It’s also the best place for us to resist,” he said, “for us to stand up and let the rest of the world know that even right in the heart of the empire, the people – local residents of DC – resisted.”","summary":"Trump takes control of police, deploys National Guard in a move DC-rights activist calls &#039;just authoritarianism&#039;.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/11/us-protesters-say-trump-using-crime-emergency-to-justify-dc-takeover?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25223532371698-1754938325.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-11 20:28:00","author":"Apps Support,Joseph Stepansky","authors":["Apps Support","Joseph Stepansky"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.189},{"id":350198566,"title":"Millie Bobby Brown Is Giving Cozy-Chic in Crocs’ New Furry Clogs","text":"Skip to main content\n\nAugust 11, 2025 1:20pm\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare to Flipboard\n\nSend an Email\n\nShow additional share options\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\nShare on Whats App\n\nPrint the Article\n\nPost a Comment\n\nCourtesy of Lillie Eiger for Crocs\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare to Flipboard\n\nSend an Email\n\nShow additional share options\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\nShare on Whats App\n\nPrint the Article\n\nPost a Comment\n\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\n\nCrocs have always been comfy, but now they’re cozy, too.\n\nThe cult-favorite footwear brand has tapped Millie Bobby Brown as global ambassador and the face of its new Surrey Hills-set campaign, highlighting the brand’s latest drop: the Classic Unfurgettable Clog.

Each one of them involves obvious improprieties that necessitate investigations. In many instances, I believe investigators will find criminal activity, which ought to be prosecuted.\n\nIt is encouraging and heartening to see that the Department of Justice has taken up a criminal investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia “Tish” James and that the Office of the Special Counsel is investigating Special Counsel Jack Smith. This could mark a new era of accountability in this country and a return to law and order.\n\nLast week, I offered a list of people who ought to get investigated by the DOJ. After reflecting on the list for a few days, I have concluded that the next person who ought to face deep scrutiny is Judge Juan Merchan, who presided over the Stormy Daniels (not-)”hush money” case. (Hush money is not illegal; it was a case about falsifying business records.)\n\nMerchan, a partisan Democrat from a deeply partisan family, presided over the most partisan political persecution of any I documented in the book. He relied on unprecedented absurdities to get Trump branded as a “convicted felon” just ahead of the election. This was a grave miscarriage of justice.\n\nThe improprieties in the case are too numerous to ignore. Here are some of them:\n\nHe’s a Joe Biden Donor\n\nThis is grounds for an ethics investigation already. Under Section 100.5 of the New York Code of Judicial Conduct, sitting judges cannot “directly or indirectly engage in any political activity.” Prohibited political activity includes “soliciting funds for, paying an assessment to, or making a contribution to a political organization or candidate.” The New York State Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics is unequivocal: “A sitting judge may not make political contributions at any time, even to a U.S. presidential candidate.”\n\nHe literally gave to a group called “Stop Republicans.” It wasn’t much money: ten dollars. But that’s ten too much according to the law. \n\nHis Daughter Is a Democrat MEGA-Fundraiser \n\nMerchan’s daughter, Loren Merchan, is an activist Democrat with ties to the prosecution. She is president of a Chicago-based leftist consulting firm, Authentic Campaigns, which counts the Senate Majority PAC, a major fundraiser for Democrats, and then-Congressman Adam Schiff as clients. Schiff was the lead manager prosecuting Trump in his first impeachment trial and would go on to become a senator from California.\n\nThe New York Post reported in March 2024 that Loren Merchan’s consultancy had raised at least $93 million in campaign donations for the election cycle. That number no doubt ballooned from there.\n\nAuthentic Campaigns bagged a staggering $36,414,889 during the 2024 election cycle, according to Open Secrets. This would make Loren Merchan one of the Democrats’ biggest fundraisers.\n\nShe was also tied to Dan Goldman, another impeachment attorney, and worked for “Kamala Harris for the People.”\n\nFor Loren Merchan’s father to preside over a trial where Trump is the defendant in an election is, as Trump put it to me, “the greatest conflict of interest of all time.”\n\nInappropriate Use of Gag Orders – Which Remains in Place \n\nMerchan gagged Trump, ordering him to not make public comments about witnesses, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, connected family members (did he have his Democrat consultant daughter in mind?), and others. He threatened Trump with fines or up to thirty days in jail.\n\nI asked President Trump in March 2025 if the gag order remained in place. “Nobody knows,” he said. “The case is over and nobody knows if it still applies. He never took it off. You know why? Because he knows how crooked it was.”\n\nAllowing the Court to Degenerate into Debauchery\n\nMerchan allowed the porn star and professional provocateur Stormy Daniels to take the stand, and her testimony was exactly what you would have expected. She shared graphic details of the alleged encounters that left jurors cringing. She reportedly made jokes that fell flat.\n\nViolation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment Rights \n\nThe Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution demands that a defendant “be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation.”\n\nAs I explain in Breaking the Law, D.A. Alvin Bragg had to piggyback Trump’s supposed falsifying business records crime to a secondary crime in order to get it classified as a felony from a misdemeanor. If he failed to do so, the statute of limitations would have run out. (That this was attempted is obvious evidence that this was a targeted political prosecution.)\n\nThe second crime finally came to light during the jury instructions.\n\nAccording to the court, Donald Trump attempted to influence an election by “unlawful means.” What were the unlawful means? Well, nobody ever specified. Instead of solving the unnamed crime issue, this only made it worse. The charge introduced a third (!) mystery crime piggybacking off the second one.\n\nIf this is sounding ridiculous, just wait until you hear that the third crime was not specified, ever!\n\nMerchan told the jury that the third crime could be multiple choice. It was a choose-your-own-adventure trial. He informed the jury that if they agreed that Trump falsified business records to influence an election, they no longer had to agree unanimously.\n\nAt a constitutional level, the jury verdict needed to be unanimous. But in Merchan’s courtroom, it did not need to be unanimous on the third crime. The jury merely needed to agree that there was a third crime, any crime.\n\nIn addition to Trump’s being denied his Sixth Amendment rights to being informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, Merchan was now denying Trump due process rights afforded to him by the Fifth Amendment.\n\nIt was absolute lunacy that this was allowed to go on.\n\nBlocking a Key Trump Witness \n\nOn the menu for the third crime was a Federal Election Commission Act (FECA) violation. While the porn star Daniels was allowed to take the stand and contradict herself, Mechan blocked the Trump team’s effort to bring in former member of the Federal Election Commission Bradley A. Smith to explain this area of the law to the jury. I see no other explanation for this other than it may have ruined Bragg’s case.\n\nConvicted Felon Trickery\n\nMerchan allowed for a dirty trick to allow for the “convicted felon” branding to stick to Trump into his second presidency.\n\nAfter Trump was convicted, and subsequently won the election anyway, Judge Merchan set sentencing for President Trump during the transition of power from Biden to Trump, on January 10, 2025. Merchan wanted to make sure he could brand Trump with the “convicted felon” tag before he became president, when it would be impossible (or at least overly complicated) to take the case any further.\n\nNow, if Trump wants to clear his name—and he certainly does—it will take years of effort.\n\nAll of this is designed to distract him during his presidency.\n\nPerhaps all of this is legal, but it is nonetheless outrageous and deeply anti-democratic to try to sabotage a president in this way.\n\nOther Improprieties\n\nThere were a series of other peculiarities and outrages in the case that are documented in Breaking the Law, such as the presence of Matthew Colangelo, the wringer brought in from the very top of Biden’s DOJ to Alvin Bragg’s Manhattan D.A. office in order to try win the case against Trump. And consider that the case would likely never have happened if the government did not have access to former-Trump attorney Michael Cohen’s gmail account as part of the investigations into the Russia collusion hoax. (Throw all the felony convictions out based on that alone!)\n\nReaders will have to read the book to see the full accounting of them all.\n\nStill, there is one more reason to investigate Juan Merchan:\n\nElection Interference\n\nThe Stormy Daniels case, like all six of the major cases against Trump, amounted to election interference. They were trying to jail him or at least monopolize his time to hamper his ability to campaign. “I should be out campaigning now instead of sitting in a very cold courthouse all day long,” Trump told reporters outside the courtroom. “This is a Biden prosecution. It’s election interference at a level that nobody in this country has ever seen before.”\n\n“This all comes from in the White House,” he said.\n\nHe was 100 percent correct. If Joe Biden had suggested this was an unfair targeted prosecution at any point, the charges certainly would have been dropped, and America could have resumed our tradition of free and fair elections.\n\nNot in Juan Merchan’s courtroom. He and Biden were going to see this through to the bitter end, which they no doubt believed saw Trump in an orange jumpsuit.\n\nThis article was adapted from portions of Breaking the Law.\n\nBreaking the Law: Exposing the Weaponization of America’s Legal System Against Donald Trump, which has been hailed by President Trump as a “must read” book, is available in hardcover, eReader format, and as an audiobook read by the author himself.\n\nAlex Marlow is the editor-in-chief of Breitbart News, a two-time New York Times bestselling author, and the host of “The Alex Marlow Show” podcast produced weekdays by Breitbart News and Salem Podcast Network.

The deal starts in 2026 and covers the fighting company’s 13 marquee shows and 30 Fight Night events annually.\nThe era of pay-per-view fights that ESPN utilized looks to be ending as all of the fights will stream on Paramount+ as part of the subscription, with some marquee bouts being simulcast on CBS. It also ends the current ESPN deal that expires at the end of 2025 and began in 2020.\n\nYou may like\n\nParamount Plus with Showtime is dead — meet Paramount Plus Premium\n\nBoxing schedule 2025: Live stream every big fight, dates, results, Usyk vs Dubois 2, Taylor vs Serrano 3, Canelo vs Crawford\n\nParamount Plus review: Pros and cons\n\nWhat’s on pay-per-view anymore? Boxing? Movies on DirecTV? It’s an outdated, antiquated model.Mark Shapiro, President of TKO Group\n\"What’s on pay-per-view anymore? Boxing? Movies on DirecTV? It’s an outdated, antiquated model,\" said Mark Shapiro, president of UFC's parent company, TKO Group said in an interview. TKO Group owns the rights to both UFC and WWE promotions. UFC and WWE merged to create TKO in 2023.\n\nAccording to NBC News, Paramount currently has no plans to charge additional fees for access to the UFC fights.\nWith UFC fights occurring throughout the year with no real set schedule, this should keep MMA fans tethered to their Paramount+ subscriptions for longer.\nMeaning you won’t see fans cancelling when the season is over in the same way that baseball or football fans might after the championship games end.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n(Image credit: Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)\n“UFC is a unicorn asset that comes up about once a decade,” said TKO Group CEO David Ellison. TKO Group\nBetween UFC and Paramount itself, Skydance has spent 15 billion dollars in less than a month. And it may not be done.\nReportedly, Paramount also wants the international rights to air UFC bouts. Due to the US deal, the company has an exclusive negotiation window with more than 20 countries that air UFC, allowing it, and because of the US deal, the company has an exclusive negotiation window with more than 20 countries that air UFC to secure those deals.\nTKO seems prepared for the future going forward as the company just inked a five-year, $1.6 billion deal with ESPN that gives the sports brand the U.S. rights to premium WWE live events.\nMoving fast\n\n(Image credit: Monticello/Shutterstock)\nThere are reports that Paramount placated the FCC and President Trump’s administration by settling a lawsuit with Trump over a “60 Minutes” Kamala Harris interview. This could have influenced the FCC to let the Skydance purchase go through.\nThe $16 million settlement will be allocated to a future Trump presidential library.\nThat and the controversial cancellation of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” has some speculating that CBS and Paramount are making moves to pacify President Trump and enable deals like the Skydance purchase.\nEither way, the deal is done, and Paramount is diving headfirst into its new Skydance era with huge streaming moves.\nFollow Tom's Guide on Google News to get our up-to-date news, how-tos, and reviews in your feeds.

The donations mark the second cycle in a row that the Teamsters’ political arm has donated to Republican candidates after contributing to Democrats exclusively for roughly two decades. \n\n“Our members are working people whose interests cut across party lines,” Kara Deniz, a Teamsters spokesperson told Politico’s Playbook, which was first to report the DRIVE PAC contributions. “And there’s no value in living in a bubble … where you only talk to certain people to the exclusion of others.”\n\nThe Teamsters’ political arm contributed $5,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee, House Republicans’ campaign arm, and a combined $62,000 to 22 House Republicans, including Reps. Nicole Malliotakis, Andrew Garbarino, Nick LaLota, and Mike Lawler, all R-N.Y., as well as Reps. Jeff Van Drew and Chris Smith, both R-N.J., during 2025’s second fundraising quarter.\n\nO’Brien has been a fierce critic of the Democratic Party’s apparent failure to engage the working class despite former President Joe Biden frequently touting his one-term tenure as “the most pro-union” presidency in American history.\n\n“Where the Democrats lost … they fell in love with their captors. They fell in love with big money. They fell in love with Big Tech. And they forgot who they’re truly representing: working people. You know why? Because they’re not in their communities, not in their neighborhoods,” O’Brien said on “Honestly with Bari Weiss” on Tuesday. “They’re not talking to the people that they’re paid to represent.”\n\n“Look, this whole election for the Democrats was based on social justice issues, right?” O’Brien added. “And it seemed like this narrative of the social justice issues, it didn’t identify with our members. Our members identify with more money in their pockets, more job protection, better pensions.”\n\nThe Teamsters’ boss was the first union president to speak at a Republican National Convention in July 2024, during which O’Brien sought to build a closer relationship between the union and Republican candidates. The Teamsters declined to endorse a presidential candidate during the 2024 presidential election following internal surveys revealing that nearly 60% of their members supported Donald Trump over former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump courted the labor vote during the 2024 political cycle, winning a majority of noncollege voters of all racial backgrounds and voters earning less than $50,000 per year last November.\n\nRepublican strategists are seeking to maintain support from working-class voters ahead of the midterms as Democratic groups invest tens of millions of dollars to win back the voting bloc.\n\n“Hardworking men and women across the country are rallying behind Republicans up and down the ballot because we fight for their jobs, their families, and their future,” NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said in a statement. “Democrats have abandoned them for their deeply out of touch, radical policies.”\n\n“These voters are key to holding and growing our majority, and we plan on doing everything we can to keep earning their support,” Marinella continued.\n\nThe Teamsters’ political arm is continuing to financially support Democratic candidates and causes. The DRIVE PAC contributed $200,000 to the Democratic Attorneys General Association and $100,000 to the Democratic Governors Association during the second fundraising quarter.\n\nA spokesperson for the Teamsters did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment\n\nCaden Olson contributed to this report.\n\nOriginally published at DailyCaller.com","summary":"DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—Republicans are continuing to receive labor union support amid Teamsters union President Sean O’Brien repeatedly lambasting Democrats for reputedly abandoning the working...

Bernie Sanders criticized 2024 Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris for what he said was her prioritizing the interests of the wealthy over the working class during her campaign last year.\n\nSanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats, lambasted the former vice president for being out of touch. “I like her, she’s a friend of mine, but her core consultants, you know, were heavily influenced by very wealthy people. How do you run for president and not develop a strong agenda which speaks to the economic crises facing working families? You know, more income and wealth inequality today than we’ve ever had.”\n\nSanders made his remarks in response to CNN anchor Dana Bash playing a clip of the Vermont senator making a similar point during his “Fighting Oligarchy” speaking tour. \n\n“One of the reasons, in my view, that Kamala Harris lost this election is she had too many billionaires telling her not to speak up for the working-class of this country,” Sanders said in a clip from his tour, prompting applause from the crowd he was speaking to. \n\nSanders campaigned for Harris in 2024 and even made the case for her candidacy to critics of her position on the war in Gaza. Still, he didn’t hold back on where he thought her campaign went wrong. \n\n“There are 60% of our people living paycheck to paycheck. You’ve got a health care system which is broken and dysfunctional—and, despite spending so much, we’re the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people. How do you not talk about these issues?” Sanders said.\n\nSanders has personal experience running presidential campaigns having participated in both 2016 and 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. He finished second behind Joe Biden in 2020, garnering about 26% of the vote. He earned about 43% of the vote in his primary bid against Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016. Sanders has been a U.S. senator since 2007 and currently serves as the ranking member on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. He was also Vermont’s at-large member of the House of Representatives from 1991 to 2007, and the mayor of Burlington, Vermont, from 1981 to 1989. \n\n“I think the clue to Democratic victories is to understand that you’ve got to stand unequivocally with the working class of this country. You need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working people,” the Vermont lawmaker added.\n\nFor her part, Harris has been discussing her presidential campaign in recent promotions for her forthcoming book “107 Days,” which documents the 2024 presidential race. Harris recently opted against running for governor of California in 2026, citing a desire to help “elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly.” \n\nAccording to recent polls, Harris’ party faces a record level of unpopularity among American voters and has taken to drafting plans to win back the support of young men.","summary":"In a CNN interview that aired on Sunday, Sen.

(Photo by Charles McQuillan/TAS24/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management )\nGetty Images for TAS Rights Management\n\n“Thinking about when she said ‘See you next era…’” Taylor Nation said in a post on X Monday morning, attaching a thread of pictures of Swift wearing orange-colored costumes.\n\nSwift and her fans have long considered each of her albums to represent a different “era” of her career—a concept she capitalized on for her $2 billion-grossing Eras Tour—but none of her albums so far have used the color orange, causing fans to speculate that could be the color scheme for her next project.\n\nFans noticed Taylor Nation posted 12 pictures of Swift wearing orange, a possible reference to her upcoming 12th studio album.\n\nAlso Monday morning, the New Heights podcast, co-hosted by Swift’s boyfriend and Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce and his brother Jason, teased a “special episode with a VERY special guest” premiering Wednesday, Aug. 13—and fans were quick to note 13 is Swift’s favorite number.\n\nThe podcast attached a picture of the co-hosts with a silhouette of a woman set to an orange background, and in the picture, Travis Kelce is seen wearing Swift’s Eras Tour merchandise.\n\nRepublic Records, Swift’s record label, commented a “❤️‍🔥” emoji on Taylor Nation’s Instagram post, and fans noticed the label also liked the New Heights podcast’s Instagram post about its upcoming episode.\n\nWhat Do We Know About Taylor Swift’s Possible New Music?\n\nNot much. Swift has not yet said anything about releasing new music, though fans have long been looking for evidence that an album could be on the way. In April, Universal Music Group Sweden posted and swiftly deleted an excerpt from an interview with Swedish DJ Jacob Criborn, who said Swedish composer Erik Arvinder was working on “finishing Taylor Swift’s record,” though he did not offer any additional details about the new music. Arvinder has worked with pop stars like Lady Gaga, Madonna and Ariana Grande.\n\nWhat Has Swift Been Up To Lately?\n\nSwift has maintained a low profile since she wrapped up the Eras Tour in December, which became the highest-grossing concert tour of all time. Swift has only made one post on Instagram in 2025 so far, announcing in May she purchased the rights to her first six albums from Shamrock Capital, ending the master recording dispute that prompted her to re-record and re-release four of her first six albums. Swift said in a post on her website she now owns her “entire life's work,” which is her “greatest dream come true.” Swift had alleged the rights to her master recordings were stripped from her without her consent when record executive Scooter Braun purchased her former record label, Big Machine Label Group, in 2019. Swift’s announcement left the future of her re-recording project unclear. She said on her website she already re-recorded her debut album, “Taylor Swift,” but has not yet finished re-recording “reputation.” Swift admitted she felt she could not improve “reputation” by re-recording it, but said she may still release the “vault” songs—previously unreleased songs she has tacked on to all her re-recorded albums—if her fans want her to. Swift’s last album release was “The Tortured Poets Department” in April 2024, which broke various streaming and sales records and led the Billboard 200 albums chart for 17 weeks.\n\nDespite staying quiet this year, Swift has been the target of several posts by President Donald Trump on Truth Social. Last week, Trump said “Woke singer Taylor Swift” is “NO LONGER HOT” and compared her unfavorably to Sydney Sweeney, who stirred controversy over her American Eagle advertisement critics felt evoked eugenics. In May, Trump said: “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’” though it is unclear what prompted the post. His May post references an earlier remark he made in September—“I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!”—which he said after Swift endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris, his 2024 election opponent.\n\nForbes Valuation\n\nSwift is worth $1.6 billion, according to Forbes estimates, making her the richest female musician in the world. Swift’s Eras Tour earnings catapulted her to billionaire status in October 2023, when she became the first musician to make the billionaire ranks solely based on the value of her songs and concert tours.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTaylor Swift Buys Back Rights To First Six Albums (Forbes)\n\nTrump knocks Taylor Swift in post supporting Sydney Sweeney, American Eagle jeans ad (USA Today)\n\nGot a tip?

The donations mark the second cycle in a row that the Teamsters’ political arm has donated to Republican candidates after contributing to Democrats exclusively for roughly two decades. (RELATED: ‘They Fell In Love With Their Captors’: Teamsters Boss Blasts Dems For Ignoring ‘Working People’)\n\n“Our members are working people whose interests cut across party lines,” Kara Deniz, a Teamsters spokesperson told POLITICO’s Playbook, who was first to report the DRIVE PAC contributions. “And there’s no value in living in a bubble … where you only talk to certain people to the exclusion of others.”\n\nThe Teamsters’ political arm contributed $5,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), House Republicans’ campaign arm, and a combined $62,000 to 22 House Republicans, including New York Reps. Nicole Malliotakis, Andrew Garbarino, Nick LaLota, Mike Lawler as well as New Jersey Reps. Jeff Van Drew and Chris Smith during 2025’s second fundraising quarter.\n\nO’Brien has been a fierce critic of the Democratic Party’s apparent failure to engage the working class despite former President Joe Biden frequently touting his one-term tenure as “the most pro-union” presidency in American history.\n\n“Where the Democrats lost … they fell in love with their captors. They fell in love with big money. They fell in love with big tech. And they forgot who they’re truly representing: working people. You know why? Because they’re not in their communities, not in their neighborhoods,” O’Brien said on “Honestly with Bari Weiss” Tuesday. “They’re not talking to the people that they’re paid to represent.”\n\n“Look, this whole election for the Democrats was based on social justice issues, right?” O’Brien added. “And it seemed like this narrative of the social justice issues, it didn’t identify with our members. Our members identify with more money in their pockets, more job protection, better pensions.”\n\nThe Teamsters’ boss was the first union president to speak at a Republican National Convention (RNC) in July 2024 during which O’Brien sought to build a closer relationship between the union and Republican candidates. The Teamsters declined to endorse a presidential candidate during the 2024 presidential election following internal surveys revealing that nearly 60% of their members supported Trump over former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump courted the labor vote during the 2024 political cycle, winning a majority of noncollege voters of all racial backgrounds and voters earning less than $50,000 per year last November.\n\nRepublican strategists are seeking to maintain support from working class voters ahead of the midterms as Democratic groups invest tens of millions of dollars to win back the voting bloc.\n\n“Hardworking men and women across the country are rallying behind Republicans up and down the ballot because we fight for their jobs, their families, and their future,” NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said in a statement. “Democrats have abandoned them for their deeply out of touch, radical policies.”\n\n“These voters are key to holding and growing our majority and we plan on doing everything we can to keep earning their support,” Marinella continued.\n\nThe Teamsters’ political arm is continuing to financially support Democratic candidates and causes. The DRIVE PAC contributed $200,000 to the Democratic Attorneys General Association and $100,000 to the Democratic Governors’ Association during the second fundraising quarter.\n\nA spokesperson for the Teamsters did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment\n\nCaden Olson contributed to this report.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

If Ossoff were genuinely concerned about abuse in detention centers against illegal immigrants, he would have chosen a date other than the very first day Trump began his term. Next, it should be noted that this date was five days before Kristi Noem, a frequent target of Democrats, was even confirmed as secretary of Homeland Security. Ossoff very clearly had a political agenda.\n\nThen, there was the revelation of the supposed incidents of abuse. Ossoff breaks down the details of his report, “compassionately” highlighting the supposed acts of violence against the detainees. \n\n“Through interviews, analysis of public reports, and site inspections, the Senator’s staff has received or identified 41 credible reports of physical and sexual abuse, 14 credible reports of mistreatment of pregnant women, and 18 credible reports of mistreatment of children in immigration detention,” read the report. \n\nYet, here is the thing. Suppose Ossoff is so concerned about illegal immigrants and violence. Why did he devote more time and resources to investigating federal detention centers holding criminal illegal immigrants than innocent Americans harmed by illegal immigrants? Innocent people such as Laken Riley, who was a resident of Ossoff’s state? Moreover, here is Ossoff’s legislative and voting history as a senator. You’d be hard-pressed to find legislation focusing on violent, criminal illegal immigrants or protecting the public from them. And you surely won’t find any special investigations or reports he authorized about immigrant crime either.\n\nSure, he voted to pass the Laken Riley Act, as did his ultra-liberal colleague from Georgia, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock. However, that vote was arguably a facade solely predicated on his political survival, given the outrage over Riley’s murder and her being from Georgia. But since Ossoff likes launching investigations, why didn’t he investigate the failures of the Biden administration’s immigration policies? Why didn’t he investigate Vice President Kamala Harris, the so-called border czar, or then-Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, whose inept leadership and policy failures allowed Riley’s killer to enter the country illegally?\n\nHowever, this is your typical modern-day Democratic politician. They care more about guarding criminals than protecting innocent people. They prioritize protecting murderers, rapists, and other bad guys over good, wholesome, righteous, moral people. Arguably, many of the country’s societal ills can be traced back to left-wing ideological implementations and political beliefs. This is especially true regarding criminal justice matters. \n\nIf Democrats such as Jon Ossoff cared more about protecting the American citizens who elected him to office than the rapists, murderers, and other violent criminals being held at detention centers, then maybe Laken Riley or any of the other innocent people brutalized and slaughtered by illegal immigrants would still be alive today.","summary":"Sen.

LaMonica McIver and other local leaders. In May, the Justice Department filed felony charges against McIver for allegedly assaulting a federal law enforcement officer during a clash earlier this month between protesters and police outside of a Newark ICE detention center. She pleaded not guilty. Baraka was charged with one count of misdemeanor trespassing at the same protest, but the charge was later dropped. In addition to addressing national and community issues, the forums are also aimed at boosting civic engagement through volunteer and voter recruitment, grassroots organizing and door-to-door outreach.\"As we build toward the 2026 midterm election, our campaign will focus on connecting past liberation struggles to the urgent demands of the present,\" said Wisdom Cole, NAACP's Senior National Director of Advocacy. NAACP invested $20 million during the 2024 presidential election to get out the vote, mobilizing over 14.5 million Black voters. While African Americans overwhelmingly backed former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 contest, President Trump earned an increasing share of Black vote, particularly among Black men. According to CBS News exit polls, Mr. Trump received 21% support among Black males and in some in states, like North Carolina, he more than doubled his support from 2020. Mr. Trump also made gains among Latino voters. The town halls come amid an increasingly intense battle over redistricting. Texas state Democrats recently fled the state to protest a new congressional map that could increase the number of GOP seats. Local civil rights groups, including the NAACP, have argued it could dilute minority voting power. California is also considering redrawing its congressional districts to counter Texas, if it succeeds.The NAACP is planning additional town halls in Texas and California in the coming months, and also other states such as North Carolina, Ohio, Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, New York and Maryland.","summary":"The midterms \"will determine whether our democracy still holds on,\" NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement to CBS News.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/naacp-town-halls-black-voters-2026-midterm-elections/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/11/82fb3c8c-7da7-4730-b1c2-7bd5867946ec/thumbnail/1200x630/536f42c9670994583b6335d2ab92837b/gettyimages-2221170556.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-11 15:01:35","author":"Nikole Killion","authors":["Nikole Killion"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.231},{"id":350098422,"title":"Bernie Sanders rips 2024 Harris campaign for being ‘heavily influenced by wealthy people’","text":"Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called out former Vice President Kamala Harris and her campaign on Sunday for being influenced by wealthy people in 2024 and failing to speak to working families.\n\nCNN’s “State of the Union” host Dana Bash pressed Sanders on a statement he made on one of his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour stops about the former vice president.\n\nBash played a clip of Sanders telling the crowd, “One of the reasons, in my view, that Kamala Harris lost this election is she had too many billionaires telling her not to speak up for the working-class of this country.”\n\nThe CNN host reacted to the clip and said, “ouch.”\n\n“I like her, she’s a friend of mine, but her core consultants, you know, were heavily influenced by very wealthy people. How do you run for president and not develop a strong agenda which speaks to the economic crises facing working families?” Sanders asked.\n\n“You know, more income and wealth inequality today than we’ve ever had. You have 60% of our people living paycheck to paycheck. You’ve got a healthcare system which is broken and dysfunctional — and despite spending so much — we’re the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people. How do you not talk about these issues?” Sanders continued.\n\nBash pushed back and said Harris talked about affordability.\n\nSanders argued that Harris talked about it vaguely, but said he didn’t want to rehash the 2024 campaign.\n\n“I think the clue to Democratic victories is to understand that you’ve got to stand unequivocally with the working class of this country. You need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working people,” Sanders said.\n\nHe went on to call for guaranteed healthcare for all Americans and an increased minimum wage.\n\n“Is it [a] radical idea to say that in the midst of a competitive global economy, we need to make sure we have the best educated workforce that all of our kids, regardless of income, should be able to get a higher education? \n\n“These ideas exist all over the world.

Veteran Journalists Face Tough Choices in the Trump Age","text":"For top journalists at elite news organizations, a song by The Clash perhaps best describes their ethical dilemma: Should I stay or should I go?\n\nFaced with buyouts, layoffs and policy shifts in the age of a vengeful and litigious President Trump, journalists at the Washington Post, Los Angeles Times and CBS News have grappled with whether to stick around and fight the good fight — or leave. At the Post there’s already been a mass defection that has included taking buyouts before moving to more stalwart outfits, leaping into the entrepreneurial reaches of Substack — or handing in principled resignations.\n\nThose exiting the Post in the last few weeks include reporter Carol Leonnig, a 25-year veteran who headed to MSNBC; media critic Erik Wemple, who will join the New York Times in the fall; and sports columnist Sally Jenkins, joining a veritable parade to The Atlantic.\n\nPolitico published an exhaustive list of the journalists that have left the publication since 2024, which have ranged from retirement to taking the buyout and moving to competitors to cartoonist Ann Telnaes, who resigned after her bosses spiked a cartoon that lampooned Post owner Jeff Bezos, among others (Telnaes would later win the Pulitizer Prize).\n\nIf resignations once delivered a reputational blow to their corporate bosses, it’s complicated now by the sense that some of these organizations appear eager to clean house, or at least remake their staffs with employees who are more pliant toward their Trump-friendly editorial postures.\n\nThis new status quo comes as CBS News faces an anticipated shift in editorial direction under New Paramount, having already seen the departures of president Wendy McMahon and “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens over perceived interference by former management.\n\nThe Washington Post, meanwhile, has witnessed a staggering exodus of talent after CEO Will Lewis issued an “our way or the highway” ultimatum amid the paper’s pivot under Bezos, encouraging staffers who don’t “feel aligned” with the newspaper’s “reinvention” to hit the road.\n\nIn May, the paper offered a Voluntary Separation Program to news employees with 10 or more years experience, resulting in a series of farewell letters from some of its most prestigious names. The opinion section has been especially hard hit, including opinion columnists Catherine Rampell, Jonathan Capehart, Philip Bump and Ruth Marcus.\n\nWriting in the Daily Beast, former Post media reporter Paul Farhi accused Lewis of “enfeebling of one of the world’s great news organizations” — “a small tragedy,” raising questions about whether Bezos cares about “the slow-motion implosion of an institution whose value transcends its bottom line.”\n\nWhile it might sound self-serving for journalists to lament the decimation of their ranks — creating “news deserts” in some areas, and prompting some to vacate the profession entirely — there is a societal toll involved. That includes questions of who will hold those in power to account, as even outlets that survive suffer the loss of institutional knowledge as they shed more expensive veterans, whether their work comes in the form of deeply sourced reporting or detailed analysis.\n\nAnother billionaire owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong, also implemented a shift in editorial policy at the Los Angeles Times, leading several editorial page staffers to resign. Again, though, the impact has been blunted by overall reductions as the paper pursues the dubious strategy of cost-cutting its way to health.\n\nThe ethical dilemma: Stay and fight or leave?\n\nThose schooled in journalistic ethics say there’s no one-size-fits-all response in terms of what to do when your employer has lost its way or taken actions that threaten its integrity.\n\nJohn Watson, a journalism professor at American University’s School of Communication who teaches ethics, cited a “personal and individually determined process,” while making a distinction between those who really need a job and top earners who don’t have to live paycheck to paycheck.\n\nFor the latter, “It becomes more of a moral and ethical issue,” Watson told TheWrap, “Bailing out at that level, to me, is the right thing to do.”\n\nSeveral L.A. Times editors resigned last year, including editorials editors Mariel Garza, Robert Greene and Karin Klein, after management spiked a story endorsing Kamala Harris. Across the country, the amount of institutional knowledge exiting the Washington Post has created the impression of a hollowed-out newsroom, even if those who remain dismiss the notion.\n\nStephen J. Adler, the director of the Ethics and Journalism Initiative at the NYU Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute, also sees an obligation to leave under such circumstances, although not without exhausting options that include lobbying for more enlightened policy and practices.\n\n“I’d never stay at any organization that compromised my work, whether by editing out information that might be offensive to the administration or by barring sensitive story topics,” Adler, who also chairs the steering committee of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, told TheWrap.\n\n“Before deciding to leave, though, I’d try to persuade my immediate editors that I’m being fair and accurate and that they shouldn’t engage in self-censorship,” he said. “I might also appeal to higher-ups. But, even in a tough job market, my duty to the highest aspirations of my profession — to truth-telling – would force me to quit if I didn’t prevail.”\n\nWatson drew a distinction between influencers and others who use media platforms, without adhering to the ethical considerations that should guide journalists.\n\n“To me, that is what separates journalists from other people who function in a mass media capacity,” he said. “Ethics tells you what your mission is, what your role is, and what your professional values have to be, and whether you can compromise them, or how much you can bend them to achieve your fundamental mission.”\n\nHe added that journalists have to be wary of whether the actions of their employers will stick with them when they leave and seek jobs elsewhere, citing what he sees as some of the unethical behavior at Fox News, which, in the highest-profile example of that, was forced to pay $787 million in 2023 to settle Dominion’s defamation lawsuit over false claims regarding the 2020 election.\n\n“I’ve had that discussion with a number of good students who are good journalists, who said, ‘Will my time at Fox hurt me when I apply to these other news organizations?’ And the simple fact is, yes, it will,” Watson said.\n\nWashington Post veterans lament its drift\n\nMany Post veterans and alumni have expressed sadness over the paper’s direction and the diminution of its staff, especially after Bezos initially invested in the paper and appeared to champion its journalism.\n\nSince then, Bezos conspicuously joined other tech leaders in attending Donald Trump’s inauguration and seemingly cozied up to the president, in ways that have rendered his decisions regarding the Post suspect.\n\nIn a lengthy Substack post, former Post fact checker Glenn Kessler detailed his decision to take the buyout, revealing a conversation with Lewis in which he expressed a desire to try to reach Fox News viewers, a futile endeavor that has bedeviled mainstream news outlets seeking to expand their reach. For starters, such efforts are hindered by the fact Fox’s top hosts spend much of its time telling its audience not to trust those outside sources, a posture the late radio titan Rush Limbaugh effectively pioneered.\n\nKessler described the Post as “like being on the Titanic after it struck an iceberg — drifting aimlessly as it sank, with not enough lifeboats for everyone.” \n\nAsked to address the impact of the buyouts, a Post spokesperson issued a statement to TheWrap that suggested they were not affecting coverage: “The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the rapidly changing industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are … As we undergo this significant reinvention, The Post continues to excel in producing high quality and impactful journalism.”\n\nIf the Post is in the midst of what looks like an identity crisis, rough waters for CBS News could also lie ahead. Among other things, the New Paramount leadership team has agreed to appoint an ombudsman to examine “any complaints of bias or other concerns” involving the news division, a concession to accusations of harboring a liberal agenda from Trump and other Republicans. Paramount CEO David Ellison has also reportedly held discussions to acquire the right-of-center digital site The Free Press, potentially giving its co-founder, Bari Weiss, a role at CBS News.\n\nIn a letter to employees upon closing the merger, Ellison addressed the news division, saying, “We take immense pride in CBS News’ legacy of impactful journalism and look forward to continuing to foster a newsroom culture where journalists are empowered, trusted and equipped to do their best work.” During a meeting with reporters Thursday, Ellison also said he had “no interest” in politicizing the news, but based on Trump’s role in the approval process, the test of that commitment will come in the days and months ahead.\n\nIn a dismal business climate for journalists, adopting a principled stand becomes especially challenging. Yet as these hallowed news organizations take on water, to use Kessler’s analogy, more journalists will face tough choices regarding when it’s time to start paddling or, barring that, jump overboard.","summary":"The exodus at the Washington Post, L.A.

In his Substack piece about what led him to leave The Post after 27 years, Kessler recalled an April 2024 meeting he had with the paper's new CEO and publisher Will Lewis, who had just assumed the role earlier in the year. \"It was strange for me to have an hour-long meeting with the publisher of the newspaper,\" Kessler told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"I've never had such a long period of time with the publisher of the newspaper.\" WASHINGTON POST BOMBARDED WITH ‘CAKE’ PARTIES FOR DEPARTING STAFFERS But what irked Kessler at the meeting was the question Lewis asked him: \"What should The Post do to appeal more to Fox News viewers?\" \"He kind of, I felt, was crossing a bit of a business-newsroom line where he was asking my advice on how to make the newspaper appeal to different audience,\" Kessler said. \"As I write in the piece, frankly, the audience of The Washington Post is mostly liberal. I mean, this is based on my anecdotal evidence based on if I wrote fact checks that gave Pinocchios to Democrats, I got lots of angry emails.

The directive caused consternation within The Post, so much so that multiple staffers resigned in protest. \"I don't understand the idea of eliminating liberal voices from the editorial page because a traditional newspaper editorial page has a lot of debate,\" Kessler said before pointing to conservative columnists that have appeared on The Post's opinion pages, namely Marc Thiessen and the late Charles Krauthammer. \"And I've always advised college students when they start reading newspapers or setting up their Twitter feeds, I always say, follow people or read people you disagree with because you're going to learn much more from people you disagree with than people you agree with,\" he continued. \"And there's some columnists I never bother to read because they're always saying the same thing, and it's not interesting, and I prefer to be challenged and prefer to have my thinking, you know, shocked into, 'Oh, I'm looking at this wrong.' So the idea that you're going to just have kind of a one-sided debate is a strange way to run a newspaper.\" A spokesperson for The Washington Post told Fox News Digital, \"The Washington Post is committed to producing high-quality journalism and riveting storytelling to reach all audiences.

Reactionaries, such as the activist Charlie Kirk and Senator Mike Lee of Utah, say it is not, never was, and shouldn’t be. They justify the antidemocratic features of the Constitution and contemporary politics—the Electoral College, the gerrymander—with the label republican, meaning a representative system with guardrails that protect political minorities (and happen to keep their side in power). Some progressives agree that the United States has never been a true democracy, but they would very much like to change that. They trace the country’s ills to this original failure and imagine the fulfillment of America’s promise in a democratic rebirth that puts real power in the hands of the people.\n\nThis is the thesis of The Right of the People: Democracy and the Case for a New American Founding, a new book by Osita Nwanevu, a writer for The New Republic and The Guardian. Nwanevu wants more collective decision making, more equality and freedom, for ordinary American voters and workers. Almost 250 years after the Declaration of Independence, he argues that genuine American democracy would be a good thing, but that creating it would require “the transformation not only of our political institutions but of our economy.”\n\nNwanevu wields journalism as a cutting tool that’s well oiled with contempt (I’ve been on its receiving end)—a style refined in the social-media polemics of the past decade’s progressive orthodoxy. After Kamala Harris’s defeat in last year’s election, Nwanevu wrote in an X post: “Yep, time to break from the left. Next time, Dems should try saying they’ll do more to crack down on immigration than Republicans. Instead of ‘Defund the Police,’ run a prosecutor. Talk about having a gun and wanting a strong military instead of your identity. Just some ideas.” Habitual sarcasm toward fools who can’t see why you’re right is usually a sign of political weakness, suggesting that you have no hope or intention of convincing the unpersuaded of anything. Contempt is a style of proud and perpetual defeat.\n\nIn The Right of the People, Nwanevu subdues his own journalistic reflexes long enough to construct a sweeping argument out of history and political theory. He says at the outset that he’s “dog-tired, already, of the habits of mind that shape American political journalism” and jaded by all the talk about threats to “our democracy” from pundits who don’t know or care what it really is. Democracy in America doesn’t just need to be defended, Nwanevu believes—it needs to be articulated, affirmed, and built: “Democracy has become a specious and suspicious platitude, equally useful to marketers and would-be dictators—a hollow idea for a hollow, unserious time.”\n\nThe Right of the People is his ambitious response. Nwanevu describes democracy as collective self-government by equals in which decisions are made by majority rule; explains why this, of all systems, is the one most worth pursuing; answers democracy’s critics, beginning with Plato; argues that democracy has been betrayed in the United States since the country’s founding; and proposes ideas and policies to make democracy an American reality. A subject on this scale doesn’t lend itself to savage takedowns. In the slower, more demanding form of a well-researched, carefully reasoned book, especially in its first half, Nwanevu takes democracy’s opponents and its own vulnerabilities seriously.\n\nAnd yet, despite the ringing title and subtitle, little in Nwanevu’s “new American founding” is new. The thesis that the Founders drafted an antidemocratic Constitution to protect their own political and economic interests dates back to the groundbreaking work of the Progressive historian Charles Beard, first published more than a century ago and contested ever since. (Nwanevu’s version relies heavily on Michael J. Klarman’s 2016 book, The Framers’ Coup, also much debated.) When Nwanevu leaves theory and history for current politics and policy, he moves onto even more familiar ground. Yes, the Senate is grotesquely unrepresentative, and unless its structure is radically changed (a constitutional near-impossibility), the people of Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico deserve senators of their own. The filibuster exaggerates the Senate’s anti-majoritarianism, giving each resident of Wyoming a far louder voice than a Californian. The unelected, life-tenured Supreme Court upholds laws that take power from common people and give it to corporations. Inequality is at Gilded Age levels, and some CEOs make several hundred times more than their employees. Amazon’s destructive effect on workers’ wages, bodies, and communities has been well documented—the journalist Alec MacGillis wrote an excellent book about it. Far too much power is concentrated in far too few hands. If you don’t think so, you haven’t been following the career of Elon Musk.\n\nNwanevu’s proposals for a new founding amount to a progressive wish list: End the Senate filibuster, expand the House of Representatives, oblige the states to abide by the national popular vote, impose Supreme Court term limits, raise taxes on wealth, break up monopolies, remove obstacles to unionizing, give workers more say in the running of companies, etc. I’m for most of it. None of it is very original.\n\nWhat’s the point of saying we need more equality and more democracy? The question is how to get them, beyond simply laying out an agenda. Other progressives, such as the legal scholar Jedediah Purdy, want a second Constitutional Convention; some of them would scrap the 1787 text as hopelessly flawed and start anew. Nwanevu doesn’t place much faith in this constitutional Hail Mary. The idea of a new convention first gained traction more than a decade ago among conservatives, and Nwanevu rightly realizes that they’re better positioned than liberals to determine the outcome. “We are still perhaps generations away from a truly democratic Constitution,” he acknowledges. “But the work toward it—and the work to build a more democratic country—must begin now.” In other words, there’s no escape from politics—from “decades of political persuasion and organization.” Exactly what that effort would look like, Nwanevu leaves to others, noting that “there are details here that political professionals and organizers are going to have to work out.”\n\nBut this is where his aspirations run up against the shortcomings of his politics. Though most of the book is a nonpartisan brief for democracy as a good in itself, in the end Nwanevu leaves no doubt that a more democratic America will be a more left-wing one. “Our frustrations with our false democracy have corroded faith in the ideal to the benefit of antidemocratic figures on the right,” he concludes. “Beyond being worthwhile on their own merits, the political and economic reforms we’ve examined constitute a democratic agenda that stands a better chance of defeating the right than the flimsy and predictable rhetoric their opponents have offered up so far.” These “opponents” are left vague, but they seem to be mainstream Democrats who are too timorous to embrace his agenda and take the fight to the right-wing adversary. According to Nwanevu, giving more power to the people will eventually bring the country around to his worldview.\n\nThis belief—that ordinary Americans are closer to New Republic and Guardian readers than most of us realize—is a besetting vice of the left, an undisturbable illusion from inside the bubble that forms around political isolation and defeat. It’s based on assumptions about what goes on in the minds of ordinary people Nwanevu shows no sign of having talked to. And it’s belied by election after election, including last year’s.\n\nIn The Right of the People, Donald Trump is barely a minor character. Nwanevu has almost nothing to say about right-wing populism—the strongest current in electoral politics around the world. He can’t explain (and doesn’t try to) why working-class Americans of all ethnicities currently seem to feel more strongly about stricter immigration enforcement than paid family and medical leave. He can’t account for the fact that those Americans who were so alienated from our fake democracy that they didn’t bother voting last year would have been likelier to have gone for Trump than for Harris.\n\nNow that Republican populism, in complete control of government, is showing itself to be a defender of plutocracy, Democrats have a chance to earn the trust of voters as the party that represents the interests and values of the majority. But to do so, Democrats have to know what country they’re living in. Nwanevu’s analysis of the original Constitutional Convention, in which conservative elites thwarted the democratic will of ordinary people for their own selfish ends, remains his vision of our America. It’s a satisfying story, but it doesn’t explain important aspects of 1787—for example, that populists in small states secured the grossly unequal structure of the Senate against the egalitarian arguments of large-state nationalists. And it gets American politics today, with a left-leaning party supported by professional elites (such as Nwanevu and me) and a right-wing party supported by less educated wage workers, nearly backwards. Persuading and organizing your fellow citizens begins with trying to understand how they think. But this is just what Nwanevu’s approach to politics never does.\n\nFor Nwanevu, democracy is ultimately about the distribution of power. Distribute it more equally, and the result will be more and better democracy. He has almost no time for Alexis de Tocqueville, who understood self-government as not just collective power to be used but a difficult art to be practiced, mastered, and easily lost. The illiberal atmosphere of the past decade, with a political culture of hostile mobs and mass delusions, doesn’t seem to trouble Nwanevu, as if it has nothing to do with democracy. He likes to quote Walt Whitman and John Dewey, but his own language never conveys their sense that democracy is a spirit, a mode of life—the only form of government that allows human beings to realize their full potential.\n\nNwanevu is right that democracy’s advocates have to do more than earnestly ring an alarm bell about authoritarianism. They also have to diagnose and fix what’s wrong with an American system that most Americans think has failed them. Majorities of both Democrats and Republicans have recently expressed the view that democracy is under threat and that self-government isn’t working. But if half the country thinks that Trump is the reason for those problems and the other half thinks that he’s the solution, arguing that more democracy will change America for the better isn’t convincing. You first have to put away sentimentality about “the people.” We’re as capable of hating one another and believing lies and making terrible decisions and using power to take away one another’s rights as we are of governing ourselves with clarity and wisdom. “We know more than the Founders did,” Nwanevu asserts in his last pages. “We are more practiced at governance. We are more moral, more just.” At a time of widespread indifference to the destruction of the most basic values that deserve to be called democratic, I’d hesitate to flatter Americans with these claims.","summary":"A new book argues for making the U.S. a “true” democracy, but fails at the essential strategy of persuasion.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2025/08/how-not-to-fix-american-democracy/683809/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/MjpjJuRj5axJ8dUfQ4lUVIc6S7g=/0x6:2842x2848/1080x1080/media/img/mt/2025/08/12004_126_05_DMF/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-11 12:00:00","author":"George Packer","authors":["George Packer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.217},{"id":350123260,"title":"Politicians are using social media to campaign – new research tells us what works and what doesn’t","text":"By the time the next US election takes place in 2028, millennial and gen Z voters – who already watch over six hours of media content a day – will make up the majority of the electorate. As gen alpha (people born between 2010 and 2024) also comes of voting age, social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram or their future equivalents can play a role in political success – if political actors can capitalise on it.\n\nOn these platforms, politics mixes with entertainment, creating fertile ground for memes and viral content that shape public opinion in real time – particularly in the US. But going viral isn’t simple, as my new research shows, and political actors have so far have struggled to make the most of it. If content doesn’t feel authentic, isn’t accompanied by clear messaging, or adapted to different platforms, then it’s unlikely to be successful. \n\nAlso, viral content spreads quickly, sometimes unpredictably, and across platforms that all behave differently. The algorithms behind viral spread are specific to each platform – and not transparent. This makes the impact of viral activity difficult to measure and hard to track. This presents a challenge to politicians and campaigns looking to capitalise on it.\n\nMy recently published research investigated this. I mapped and visualised the “Kamala IS brat” phenomenon as it moved across X, Instagram and TikTok in the run-up to the 2024 US election. The aim of the research was to investigate the anatomy of a viral movement: what made it spread on each platform, how long did it last, and who was driving it. \n\nI found that viral political content that emerges on X spreads by a mix of strategic communication, and letting the audience do the rest. It often spreads to TikTok through catchy adaptations, and moves slightly slower on Instagram, but “explainer” content with images, for instance – often from a mix of everyday users and mainstream media outlets keeps – it visible. \n\nViral content moves between platforms, adapting to the environment of each as it is transformed into audio and visual forms. My research found that using audio was particularly powerful: turning quotes into soundbites and superimposing dance trends onto political backgrounds made for hugely shareable combinations, and the more surreal, the better. \n\nMost people think that going viral is short-lived, but this study – and other research – has found that digital content has a “long tail”: it pops up, resurges and re-emerges, days, weeks, or even months later, offering new chances to reconnect with audiences. \n\nThis was particularly apparent on X, where content was re-used and re-contextualised in satirical and humorous ways. This wasn’t always positive. In the data I analysed, Republican supporters used the phrase “Kamala IS brat” to try and switch the narrative into something negative but it’s likely that this increased visibility as views are driven by influential public figures and shared by meme accounts. \n\nFor politicians, this potential for re-emergence means that successful social media engagement is not just about strategic planning, it’s more about understanding how audiences remix and repost content in ways that can be hard to predict.\n\nIt’s not about rigidly tailoring content to each platform either, but about adapting to their styles. Effective digital strategists work with, not for, their audience, and make the most of moments that can’t always be planned in advance. Canada’s prime ministerial candidate, Mark Carney, for instance, embraced the hashtag #elbowsupCanada during his successful 2025 campaign.\n\nThe research also found that posting the right type of content is important – and short-form content works best. Social media platforms use a mix of recommender and social algorithms, that are politically intuitive. A high number of followers can still help to increase visibility, but getting the content right can extend viral reach, regardless of how many followers an account has. \n\nTikTok’s algorithm in particular is set up for exploration, and Instagram’s Threads already pushes political content to users, not necessarily from accounts that they follow. Research suggests that users of any platform expect to see political content, whether they’re looking for it or not. \n\nGiven the potential for viral activity to reach a huge – and increasingly politically significant – audience, the challenge remains for political actors to turn social media engagement into electoral gain. \n\nMany are trying, with varying levels of success. Harris’s digital-first strategy took an innovative approach – giving creative licence to a rapid response team of 25-year-olds. The digital campaign itself was considered a blueprint for PR success, but it ultimately failed to translate into votes. This was probably because it wasn’t accompanied by clear, concise messaging. \n\nOther political hopefuls, such as Arizonan activist Deja Foxx and Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, are also capitalising on social media engagement. While Foxx recently lost in her bid to become the first gen Z woman to be elected to Congress, her approach, based on catchy content and influencer tactics, turned a long-shot candidacy into a very competitive campaign.\n\nMamdani has had more tangible success. His effective use of social media visuals, and multilingual engagement expanded his reach, and were credited with helping him win New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary in June. \n\nSo, if politicians can get it right, there is growing evidence that capitalising on going viral can influence political success. \n\nSocial media won’t win an election on its own, but looking ahead to 2028, it’s increasingly likely to be a part of a winning campaign. Young voters are far from a monolith, but what they do have in common is where they spend their time: on social media. TikTok remains the fastest-growing platform among this age group. Far from just providing entertainment, many use it to get their news, and engage in politics. Campaigns can’t afford to ignore it.","summary":"Politicians who have tried to use social media in recent campaigns have not always been successful.

The company, now dubbed \"Paramount, a Skydance Corporation,\" oversees a variety of media and entertainment assets, including CBS, Comedy Central, MTV, the Paramount Plus streaming service and the iconic movie studio. Once the long-planned deal officially closed on Thursday, Ellison prioritized CBS News over the other properties. Ellison and Paramount Chair of TV Media George Cheeks visited CBS News’ New York City headquarters, popping in for the 9 a.m. editorial meeting and then briefly meeting with CBS News executives, including newly-minted \"60 Minutes\" executive producer Tanya Simon. One CBS News employee told Fox News Digital Ellison then received a quick tour of the \"60 Minutes\" offices and spent some time shaking staffers’ hands. PARAMOUNT, SKYDANCE COMPLETE $8 BILLION MERGER AS FCC CONTINUES CBS PROBE \"Everyone was happy he stopped by the meeting, and they made it clear it was his first stop after closing the deal. Obviously symbolic but also encouraging that he would do that,\" a second CBS News staffer told Fox News Digital. \"He was very complimentary of the team and said he believed in us. He was joined by George Cheeks who echoed that,\" the staffer continued. \"They acknowledged how hard of a time the merger has been for the division, especially.\" \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King and \"60 Minutes\" correspondents Lesley Stahl, Bill Whitaker and Anderson Cooper all said hello to Ellison, the son of billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, during the visit. The second CBS News insider added that everyone is \"cautiously optimistic\" about the new regime. SKYDANCE INFORMS TRUMP’S FCC IT WILL ELIMINATE DEI AT PARAMOUNT, CREATE CBS NEWS OMBUDSMAN FOLLOWING MERGER Ellison’s takeover comes after a rough stretch for the Tiffany Network’s news division. Prior to the merger closing, Paramount and CBS agreed to settle President Donald Trump’s \"election interference\" lawsuit last month for a sum expected to be north of $30 million, including $16 million upfront for Trump's presidential library. The lawsuit accused CBS of aiding then-Vice President Kamala Harris through deceptive editing ahead of the presidential election. The settlement irked many inside CBS News, but fallout from the ordeal began before the deal was reached. In April, \"60 Minutes\" executive producer Bill Owens resigned, claiming he could no longer maintain editorial independence from corporate honchos while CBS' parent company, Paramount Global, was in a months-long legal battle with the president. Owens had long insisted he would not apologize for the edit at the center of Trump’s claims. FCC APPROVES PARAMOUNT-SKYDANCE MERGER FOLLOWING TRUMP SETTLEMENT, COLBERT CANCELLATION The following month, CBS News President and CEO Wendy McMahon was pushed out of the network. \"It’s become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward,\" she said. The \"60 Minutes\" ordeal and executive departures came as CBS' morning and evening newscasts are both stuck in third place behind rivals ABC and NBC. Ellison has not named a new, long-term head of CBS News and has refused to comment on \"rumors,\" although employees enjoy working with current CBS News president Tom Cibrowski, who joined the company earlier this year. Meanwhile, FCC chairman Brendan Carr has not closed the proceedings he previously opened against the network for \"news distortion\" in the airing of the infamous interview with Harris. Any fallout will now land on Ellison and the company’s new leadership. Ellison published an open letter on Thursday, calling CBS News the \"home to one of the most storied American broadcast journalism legacies in America, including ‘60 Minutes,’ with a long tradition of impactful reporting led by seasoned journalists committed to accuracy, integrity, and public trust.\" PARAMOUNT, CBS FORCED TO PAY EIGHT FIGURES, CHANGE EDITORIAL POLICY IN SETTLEMENT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP Ellison appeared on CNBC on Friday and continued to praise CBS News. \"When you think about the legacy of CBS News and ‘60 Minutes,’ the home of Walter Cronkite, it is a storied legacy that we intend to honor and carry forward,\" Ellison said. Ellison had previously committed to installing an ombudsman at CBS News, but insisted it won’t be any sort of distraction moving forward. \"It is a vehicle for transparency, not oversight. And it basically is a way for both external and internally for people to provide feedback. And then that gets reported up to the president of Paramount, Jeff Shell. It doesn't get reported anywhere else,\" Ellison said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Our No.1 job is to entertain and inspire audiences around the world. And with respect, I don't believe that that means that they want us to inject politics into everything we do. I actually think they want the opposite,\" he continued. \"And so from that standpoint, we just believe that if you're breathing, you're our audience and we don't intend to politicize the company.\" Whether Ellison’s vision will translate into renewed confidence in CBS News remains to be seen, but his early outreach appears to have struck the right tone.","summary":"CBS News staffers express cautious optimism as David Ellison prioritizes the news division during his inaugural visit as Paramount&apos;s new CEO.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/embattled-cbs-news-staffers-express-cautious-optimism-over-new-paramount-ceo-after-tumultuous-year","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/david-ellison-cbs.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6375673713112","publish_date":"2025-08-11 11:00:13","author":"Brian Flood,Joseph Wulfsohn","authors":["Brian Flood","Joseph Wulfsohn"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":350092594,"title":"How Much Is Trump Profiting Off the Presidency?","text":"A journalist asked Trump if he would release his tax returns, as Presidents had done for decades. Trump said no, and then explained just how unconstrained he felt by such conventions. He’d recently learned that the President, being beholden only to the voters, is subject to none of the regulations that restrict subordinate officials from conducting private business on the side. He called the loophole “a no-conflict-of-interest provision,” as if it were a perk of his employment contract.\nTo illustrate just how glaring a conflict the law allowed him, Trump volunteered that, during the transition, he’d entertained a two-billion-dollar offer “to do a deal in Dubai.” The offer had come from Hussain Sajwani, an Emirati real-estate tycoon with close ties to his country’s rulers. Trump emphasized that he “didn’t have to turn it down.” Nevertheless, he’d passed, because he didn’t “want to take advantage of something”; he disliked “the way that looks.” Therefore, he continued, his eldest sons, Donald, Jr., and Eric, would assume daily management of his businesses until he left office.\nTrump then turned things over to Sheri Dillon, one of his tax lawyers, who argued that he could hardly be expected to do more than the temporary handover. Trump would not “destroy the company he built.” Since Trump’s star turn on the NBC reality show “The Apprentice,” the Trump Organization had mainly sold the use of his name. Most of its profits came from developers who flew the Trump flag over buildings that he didn’t build or own, or from businesses that used his name to sell shirts, mattresses, or pizza. If Trump tried to off-load his whole company, Dillon explained, a buyer might overpay in order “to curry favor with the President,” or, just as worrisome, might demean the highest office in the land by crassly cashing in on the President’s name. Trump and his family, Dillon declared, would never do anything that might “be perceived to be exploitive of the office of the Presidency.”\nThat was a different era. Dillon’s firm stopped representing Trump in 2021, after the mob he stirred up attacked the U.S. Capitol. And in Trump’s second term the President and his family have paid no mind to their lawyer’s promise. During Trump’s first term, they pledged to abstain from any new deals overseas. That’s out the window. The Trumps are now cashing in on five major deals in the Persian Gulf alone. Donald, Jr., on a recent visit to Qatar, said that the family’s restraint during the first Trump Administration had not stopped his father’s critics from constantly accusing the family of “profiteering.” So the Trumps would no longer lock themselves in “a proverbial padded room, because it almost doesn’t matter—they’re going to hit you no matter what.” (A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization told me that it employs an outside ethics adviser—currently, Karina Lynch, a lawyer and a lobbyist who previously worked as a Republican Senate staffer and has represented Donald, Jr.—to “avoid even the appearance of impropriety.”)\nMany payments now flowing to Trump, his wife, and his children and their spouses would be unimaginable without his Presidencies: a two-billion-dollar investment from a fund controlled by the Saudi crown prince; a luxury jet from the Emir of Qatar; profits from at least five different ventures peddling crypto; fees from an exclusive club stocked with Cabinet officials and named Executive Branch. Fred Wertheimer, the dean of ethics-reform advocates, told me that, “when it comes to using his public office to amass personal profits, Trump is a unicorn—no one else even comes close.” Yet the public has largely shrugged. In a recent article for the Times, Peter Baker, a White House correspondent, wrote that the Trumps “have done more to monetize the presidency than anyone who has ever occupied the White House.” But Baker noted that the brazenness of the Trump family’s “moneymaking schemes” appears to have made such transactions seem almost normal.\nHow much money does it all amount to? What’s the number? In March, Forbes, known for ranking the wealth of billionaires, estimated that Trump’s net worth had more than doubled in the previous year, surpassing five billion dollars. In July, the Times put Trump’s wealth at upward of ten billion. Yet both estimates included billions of dollars in paper profits that would almost certainly disintegrate if the Trumps pulled out of certain investments. (What’s Truth Social worth without him?) These estimates also included assets untainted by any obvious exploitation of the Presidency, such as properties that Trump owned before entering office, or fees paid by resort customers who simply want to play golf or book a hotel room.\nAlthough the notion that Trump is making colossal sums off the Presidency has become commonplace, nobody could tell me how much he’s made. Norm Eisen, a government-ethics lawyer and a vocal Trump critic, said, “We don’t know the full amounts.” Robert Weissman, a co-president of the left-leaning advocacy group Public Citizen, said, “We will never really know.” Wertheimer noted that for decades Trump had boasted constantly, and in detail, about how rich he was. “He doesn’t talk about it anymore,” Wertheimer said. “He may be the greatest con artist in American history.”\nA more considered accounting seemed in order. I decided to attempt to tally up just how much Trump and his immediate family have pocketed off his time in the White House.\n“The Apprentice,” on which he played the outsized version of himself that he has always tried to project to the world, once covered his losses. In the seven years following its début, in 2004, the show paid him $135.2 million. And its glamorizing effect allowed him to make money without buying or building anything, just by licensing his name and selling endorsements. Nearly all the real-estate projects he announced during this period—from Hawaii to Israel—were licensing deals. Licensing and endorsements made him $103.2 million in riskless profit. “I don’t want to say it was free revenue,” Donald, Jr., later testified in a New York court. But he did allow that the company’s licensing business was “a pretty spectacular system.”\nYet even the “Apprentice” windfall wasn’t always enough to keep Trump in the black. According to annual reports that the Trumps sent their lenders from 2011 to 2017, during those years Trump brought in $259 million from television and licensing contracts, but, thanks to his habit of overspending on properties, he still reported a negative cash flow of $46.8 million. Dwindling viewership numbers had killed “The Apprentice” in 2010, and by 2015 its doubly gimmicky offspring, “The Celebrity Apprentice,” was ailing, too. Trump’s licensing, endorsement, and “Apprentice” income fell to $22 million that year. Buettner and Craig note that between 2014 and 2016 Trump sold about $220 million in stock—nearly all his stock holdings—apparently to make up for losses as that income tapered off. Then, on June 16, 2015, Trump launched his first Presidential campaign with a speech in which he described Mexican immigrants as criminals and “rapists.” NBC kicked him off the air. Macy’s, Serta, and Phillips-Van Heusen ended endorsement deals.\nAfter Trump won the election, lawsuits filed in the backlash against his Presidency added some big new expenses. By the start of his second term, he owed nearly five hundred million dollars to New York State, which had sued him for fraud, and more than $88 million to E. Jean Carroll, who had sued him for sexual assault and defamation. (Appeals are still pending.) Trump, in short, was in a tight spot when he first entered the White House and in an even tighter one when he returned. Just six months later, his financial situation has vastly improved.\nCritics of Trump’s “oligarchy” invariably point to his relationship with Elon Musk. Musk contributed more than $290 million to back Trump and other Republicans in 2024. Trump then gave him an Administration role with seemingly extralegal power to reorder federal agencies; all the while, Musk’s businesses Tesla, SpaceX, and Starlink were profiting from government contracts or subsidies. In March, the President performed in what was effectively a television commercial on the White House lawn. Trump, after announcing that he would purchase a red Tesla parked there, declared, “It’s a great product—as good as it gets.” All that may be unseemly. Yet every American political campaign relies on private donations. All modern Presidents have sold access for campaign money, and all have rewarded donors with political appointments—especially ambassadorships.\nMore important, campaign-finance laws restrict how Trump can use his political war chest. Since reëntering the White House, Trump has raised the record-breaking sum of six hundred million dollars for his political operation. He can tap into that reserve to attack congressional enemies, and he can direct it toward other campaigns. (Donald, Jr., has contemplated a Presidential run.) Yet the money generally can’t bankroll personal expenses. In the campaign-money game, Trump plays at an Olympian level, but he hasn’t changed the rules.\nPersonal self-enrichment is where Trump is a true innovator, and his winnings in that category are also harder to quantify. On his tax returns, Trump has aggressively minimized the value of his assets and maximized the extent of his losses. On loan applications, he’s done the opposite, puffing up his wealth to borrow as much as possible. And on the financial-disclosure forms he’s been required to file as a candidate or as President, he usually provides only a business’s gross revenue, not its bottom line, thus reporting tens of millions of dollars in “income” from hotels that are actually losing money.\nBruce Dubinsky, a forensic accountant who testified in the fraud trial of Bernie Madoff and investigated the collapse of Lehman Brothers as a part of its bankruptcy, closely followed Trump’s New York fraud trial. Dubinsky told me that the opaque ownership structure of the Trump businesses makes it difficult to assess changes in his net worth. It’s similarly hard to isolate his Presidential profits, in part because estimating how much his businesses might have made if he weren’t President would require detailed comparisons with similar enterprises that have non-Presidential owners. By way of example, Dubinsky, who lives in Florida, noted that he’d recently visited the Trump golf course in Jupiter, “just to play golf.” He added, “So how much value to assign to his status as President is a daunting task.”\nThat blurriness is why ethics experts say that any outside business can pose a conflict of interest and may open a conduit for bribery. But, propriety aside, I was after a fair, dispassionate quantification of the Trumps’ profits from two Presidencies. Mar-a-Lago, the for-profit club that has become the MAGA mecca and the weekend White House, was an obvious place to start.\n\nIn 2016, Trump, while running for President, was also suing a restaurateur for cutting ties over his bigoted comments about Mexican immigrants. In a deposition that summer, Trump testified that the Presidential race had so far had no “huge impact” on his hotel and resort businesses, which were “fairly steady.” One exception, he said, was Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach estate he’d turned into a private club after acquiring it, in 1985, for roughly ten million dollars. As though surprised by a happy accident, Trump testified that, according to the club’s manager, the campaign had given Mar-a-Lago “the best year we’ve ever had.”\nIf many Presidents have traded access for campaign donations, only Trump has run a business selling an open-ended opportunity to mingle with him and his circle. In addition to the revenue he generated by holding his own campaign events at his club, he has profited from other candidates, conservative groups, and influence seekers rushing to hold events there, too. The club says that it limits membership to five hundred people; each reportedly pays an annual fee of about twenty thousand dollars. But after the 2016 election Trump began jacking up the initiation fee. In 2016, it was a hundred thousand dollars; last fall, it was set to rise to a million.\nTrump’s financial-disclosure forms indicate that since 2014 Mar-a-Lago’s annual revenue has jumped from ten million dollars to fifty million. At the same time, Forbes reported, operating costs have been stable, ranging from twelve million to sixteen million dollars a year. Adding it all up, I calculated that Trump’s Presidencies have brought him at least $125 million in extra profits from Mar-a-Lago.\nEstimated gain: $125 million\nLEGAL FEES AND TRUMP MERCH\nAlthough candidates cannot pocket campaign contributions, no President has ever tried as hard as Trump to siphon off at least some of that money. According to the nonprofit OpenSecrets, in the past decade Trump’s campaigns have spent more than twenty million dollars at his own hotels and resorts, contributing to Mar-a-Lago’s spike in profits. But how much, if any, of this money reached his personal accounts is impossible to guess.\nTrump’s 2016 and 2024 campaign operations paid him a total of eighteen million dollars for the use of his own Boeing 757—the so-called Trump Force One. (Air Force One ferried him around during the 2020 campaign, as is standard for a sitting President.) But Barack Obama, in 2008, and Mitt Romney, in 2012, each spent a comparable sum to charter campaign planes.\nTrump, however, is the first Presidential candidate to run a private online store that competes against his own campaign in selling campaign-style merch, effectively diverting his supporters’ money into his own pocket. It’s as if a fashion designer had set up a table in front of a department store to sell knockoffs of his own company’s products, at the expense of its shareholders. Among the Trump Store’s wares: a red “Gulf of America” baseball hat (fifty dollars), a pair of Trump beer koozies (eighteen dollars), and Trump flip-flops (forty dollars). Buyers might well believe that such purchases fund the MAGA cause or its candidates, yet Trump’s financial-disclosure forms indicate that he has made more than seventeen million dollars in income from such sales. At those prices—with negligible marketing expenses, thanks to his role as head of state—that income is surely almost all profit. Trump’s most recent disclosure form also listed licensing income of $1.1 million from a Trump guitar, $2.8 million from Trump watches, $2.5 million from “sneakers and fragrances,” $3 million from an illustrated book called “Save America,” and $1.3 million from a “God Bless the USA” Bible. That adds up to at least $27.7 million from faux campaign paraphernalia.\nA political campaign fund cannot pay a candidate’s personal legal bills. But Trump found a loophole: a campaign fund can be converted into a political-action committee, and the looser restrictions on a PAC allow the use of donor funds to pay such expenses. Through his PACs, Trump has spent more than a hundred million dollars of his supporters’ contributions to defend himself against an array of charges: that he defamed E. Jean Carroll while denying her account of his sexual assault, that he fraudulently hid a payoff to a porn star during the 2016 campaign, that he conspired to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and that he stole and hid classified documents after leaving the White House. Unless all those charges are part of a vast deep-state conspiracy, relieving Trump of the bills looks like a hundred-million-dollar gift for personal expenses.\nEstimated gain: $127.7 million\nRunning total: $252.7 million\nTHE D.C. HOTEL\nDuring the President’s first term, no business figured more prominently in Democratic allegations of corruption than did the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Zach Everson, who wrote an online newsletter about the scene there, told me that the hotel was “the epicenter of the swamp.” Foreign leaders booked blocks of rooms. Industry trade groups held conventions. Lobbyists, lawmakers, and Cabinet officials crowded the bar. Trump often visited; staff told Everson that tips suffered because guests stayed at their tables to gawk until the President left. If you wanted to curry his favor, where else in Washington would you stay? In 2018, when T-Mobile was seeking regulatory approval to acquire Sprint, John Legere, then T-Mobile’s chief executive, was spotted there. In ten months, he and other company executives spent nearly two hundred thousand dollars at the hotel; Legere denied any scheme to influence the White House and said he was a “longtime Trump-hotel stayer.” (The merger was approved.)\nAll this patronage surely flattered Trump’s ego, but it never fattened his wallet. The hotel lost money each year of his first term—a total of more than seventy million dollars. Industry executives familiar with the hotel’s operations told me that Trump’s Presidency repelled as many potential customers as it attracted. Many foreign leaders, lobbyists, and executives who might otherwise have paid handsomely for the Trump hotel’s location and luxury stayed elsewhere, fearing entanglement in an influence scandal. (T-Mobile’s Legere endured a grilling on Capitol Hill about his choice of accommodations.) In the two years after Trump’s election, hotels in Toronto, New York, Rio de Janeiro, and Panama City that had licensed the Trump name ditched it, presumably in part because it was driving away business. A Hawaii hotel followed suit in 2023.\nTrump had agreed in 2012 to pay the federal government at least three million dollars a year for a long-term lease of the D.C. building, a former post-office headquarters, and to invest at least two hundred million in renovations. The hotel opened in 2016, and Trump sold it in 2022 for $375 million. Craig and Buettner, after reviewing his tax returns, conclude that he roughly broke even. Hilton Hotels took over the management, under its Waldorf Astoria brand, and people familiar with its operations said that its financial performance has improved markedly.\nDuring Trump’s first term, Trump Turnberry, his golf resort in Scotland, also drew allegations of improper Presidential self-enrichment, because the U.S. military sometimes paid to put up service members there during overnight stops at the nearby Prestwick Airport. During the twenty-three months ending in July, 2019, the Pentagon spent at least a hundred and eighty-four thousand dollars at Trump Turnberry (at a discounted nightly room rate averaging $189.04).\nYet that property, too, lost money all four years of the first Trump Administration. It finally entered the black in 2022. And U.S. service members continued to stay there under President Joe Biden. An Air Force spokesman told me that there had been “no change” in the military’s use of the facility: “Aircrews are allowed to select the Trump Turnberry Resort, along with other hotel options in the area, if the lodging meets specific criteria of availability, suitability, expense, and proximity.”\nSpending at Trump’s hotels by government agencies and influence seekers looked to me like a wash.\nEstimated gain: $0\nRunning total: $252.7 million\nTHE PERSIAN GULF\nThe Persian Gulf has posed a unique commercial opportunity and ethical challenge for the first Commander-in-Chief who’s also a real-estate salesman. The Gulf’s Arab monarchs play complementary double roles: each is both a head of state and a major buyer of U.S. real estate and other assets. The Gulf royals put money in the very kinds of properties and investments that Trump’s family sells. In a recent interview with Tucker Carlson, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Middle East envoy and a fellow real-estate mogul, expressed delight that the mind-set of Gulf rulers facilitates dealmaking: “Everybody’s a business guy there!” But these business guys were deeply entangled with the Trump crowd. Trump, Witkoff, and others in the two Trump Administrations—including Jared Kushner, the husband of Trump’s daughter Ivanka—had sold or tried to sell assets to the Gulf’s ruling families before entering government. And both sides can expect to do business again once Trump leaves office.\nUnlike heads of state in, say, Western Europe, the Gulf monarchs wield extraordinary power over the businesses of their subjects. A Gulf monarch controls the fossil-fuel revenue that ultimately drives every enterprise in his country, from the lowliest shawarma stand to the finest resort. And he is unconstrained by independent courts or Western-style laws that might protect private interests. The richer a Gulf tycoon, the more he must depend on his sovereign’s good will. So a deal with a private firm is sometimes not much different from a deal with a ruler.\nDuring the 2016 Republican primaries, Trump boasted of having sold condos to Saudis: “They buy apartments from me. They spend forty million, fifty million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.” Nevertheless, he’d struggled to make licensing deals in the Gulf. The few developers outside North America willing to pay for the use of his family name were mostly building condominiums in lower-rent parts of the developing world. He’d made hundreds of thousands of dollars a year licensing his name for a two-tower project in Istanbul. (On his three most recent annual disclosure forms, he reported receiving $489,182, $392,360, and $288,061. Reporting periods can be irregular.) He’d also licensed his name for four apartment towers in India, six in South Korea, one in the Philippines, and another in Uruguay. (Resorts or other planned ventures in Georgia, Azerbaijan, and elsewhere fell through after he was elected.) Trump’s only beachhead in the Gulf was a deal with Hussain Sajwani, the tycoon close to Emirati rulers. In 2013, Sajwani, the self-styled “Donald of Dubai,” had agreed to pay the Trump Organization to manage a Trump-branded golf course, surrounded by villas, in Dubai.\nWhen Trump was running for President in 2016, at least one emissary from the campaign suggested to the Emirati rulers that Trump’s deal with Sajwani gave them an in. Tom Barrack, Trump’s friend and informal adviser, wrote in an e-mail to the Emirati Ambassador, Yousef Al Otaiba, that Trump “has joint ventures in the U.A.E.!”\nBarrack prompted the U.A.E. to begin courting Kushner, Trump’s incoming Middle East adviser, and this effort appeared to pay off stunningly. Through Kushner, the Emiratis helped persuade Trump to travel to the Persian Gulf for his first Presidential trip abroad. They also helped get Trump to support their preferred heir to the Saudi throne, Mohammed bin Salman, now the crown prince and de-facto ruler, instead of a royal cousin who’d long been the American favorite. Most remarkably, in 2017 Trump supported the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia in a feud with neighboring Qatar. The Emiratis and the Saudis had accused their regional rival of supporting Islamist movements, and organized a blockade designed to starve the country. Qatar is a Pentagon partner, largely funding an American airbase west of Doha, and Trump’s stance contradicted the positions of his Secretaries of State and Defense. (The Saudis and the Emiratis patched things up with Qatar at the end of Trump’s first term; he and the rulers involved now act like the blockade never happened.)\nHad the payments for the Dubai golf course helped the Emiratis win Trump’s favor? Would a deal with the Trump Organization have protected Qatar? A senior official of a Gulf state told me that the region’s rulers now view business with Trump “as a kind of safeguard.”\nIt did not take long after Trump’s first term for his family to return to the Gulf. He had left the White House in disgrace following the January 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, but the scandal didn’t dislodge him from his position as a political kingmaker. Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, had to make a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago to atone for declaring that Trump must accept responsibility for instigating the riot. Yet Trump and his family were now liberated from the duties of public office, and freer than ever to cash in on his status as the once and future President.\nKushner went first. During Trump’s first term, he’d quietly backed Mohammed bin Salman during the prince’s consolidation of power in Riyadh, even pushing Trump to stand by him after Saudi agents murdered Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and a Virginia resident. Shortly after leaving the White House, Kushner asked the Saudi sovereign wealth fund to invest two billion dollars with a private-equity firm that he was founding, Affinity Partners.\nThe Saudi fund’s panel of investment advisers unanimously objected. Kushner had worked almost exclusively in real estate and never in private equity, and he was asking the Saudis to put up a vast sum when no American had invested a penny. The panel called the management fee that Kushner wanted—1.25 per cent of the firm’s assets, or $25 million, each year—“excessive,” given his lack of relevant experience. The advisers also worried about a “public relations” problem: the deal might look like a payoff.\nThe Saudi fund’s board, controlled by the crown prince, ignored the advice. Two billion dollars it was. Emirati and Qatari investors soon kicked in hundreds of millions more. Terry Gou, the Taiwanese businessman and politician who founded the manufacturing giant Foxconn and maintains close ties to China’s leaders, also invested. (While in the White House, Kushner helped arrange subsidies for a Foxconn factory in Wisconsin.) And in 2024, as Trump was poised to retake the Presidency, Kushner’s firm raised an additional $1.5 billion from the Qataris and Emiratis, bringing its assets under management to $4.8 billion.\nIf all the investors besides the Saudis pay the industry-standard management fee of two per cent a year, Affinity’s annual revenue comes to $81 million. Under conventional private-equity terms, Kushner’s firm, after repaying management fees, can keep an additional twenty per cent of any returns on its investments (although Kushner agreed to share some of that with the Saudis). That cut of the profits is typically the biggest windfall for a private-equity firm, and reports indicate that at least some of Kushner’s early investments, including in an Israeli financial firm and a German fitness company, are paying off. But even if Kushner fails utterly—a renewable-energy lender that his fund invested in, Solar Mosaic, recently filed for bankruptcy, in part because of Trump policy changes—Affinity still stands to take in $810 million over ten years, a typical life span for such a fund.\nCongressional Democrats have asked if Kushner might be selling influence as part of the deal. Since leaving the Trump Administration, Kushner has described himself as an informal foreign-policy adviser to his father-in-law and to members of Congress. He’s also reportedly conversed with the Saudi crown prince about such foreign-policy matters as relations with Israel, and at a conference last year he said that, thanks to his White House experience, he and his firm could “do things on the geopolitical side, on the connections side.”\nLast fall, Senator Ron Wyden, of Oregon, and Representative Jamie Raskin, of Maryland, unsuccessfully urged the Biden Administration’s Department of Justice to appoint a special counsel to investigate whether Kushner was illegally acting as an unregistered foreign agent. In a public letter, Wyden and Raskin argued that “the Saudi government’s decision to engage Affinity for investment advice” appeared to be “a fig leaf for funneling money directly to Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump,” possibly “to curry favor” or “reward them for favorable U.S. policy towards Saudi Arabia during the first Trump administration.” (Kushner called the letter a political stunt, and has argued that critical coverage of the Saudi deal only helps his firm. Although journalists “think they’re writing a bad thing,” he told Forbes, businesspeople who read those articles discover “that I’m very trusted by my partners.”)\nAffinity’s fees, of course, must cover overhead, from staff compensation to office space. But Kushner is the founder and sole owner, and it’s unimaginable that the firm could have reaped such sums from those investors without his father-in-law’s Presidencies. We might conservatively assume that he personally keeps between half and two-thirds of Affinity’s fees over ten years. (He will make far more if the fund turns a profit.) Half would be $405 million. On Wall Street, the “present value” of that stream of future income—taking into account the cost of delay—is about $320 million.\nKushner also has real-estate projects in the works that pose additional conflicts of interest for Trump. A partnership with the Serbian government (backed by an Emirati investor) to build a Trump-branded hotel in Belgrade has been derailed by the discovery that its approval was based on a document that a Serbian official allegedly forged. But in January the Albanian government preliminarily approved a partnership with Kushner to build a hundred-and-eleven-acre resort on one of the few undeveloped islands in the Mediterranean. The project is said to entail a $1.4-billion investment. Still, both are real-estate developments—Kushner’s area of expertise. Unlike with the Saudi investment, it’s unfair to attribute those deals entirely to Trump’s public office, and it’s premature to guess what Kushner or his investors in the projects might someday earn. It is safest to say only that his private-equity firm has added at least $320 million to the family’s Presidential profits.\nEstimated gain: $320 million\nRunning total: $572.7 million\nMORE SAUDI DEALS\nTrump’s first business with the Saudis upon leaving the White House involved golf. After the Capitol riot, the P.G.A. of America cancelled a contract to hold its televised championship the next year at his course in Bedminster, New Jersey, depriving Trump of valuable publicity. Fortunately for him, Saudi Arabia was launching its own pro-golf association, LIV, and it agreed to hold a televised tournament at Bedminster. (The next year, LIV announced a “framework agreement” to merge with the P.G.A. Tour; the deal hasn’t yet closed.)\nBut holding the LIV tournament at Bedminster may have made sense for both parties even if Trump had never been President. Trump has said that he got only “peanuts” from LIV, and that’s normal: clubs host such events mainly for publicity. The Saudis, for their part, secured access to a nice golf course at a time when many wouldn’t welcome them, given their human-rights record and LIV’s rivalry with the P.G.A. Tour. This alliance of pariahs may have drawn Trump and the Saudis closer together, but it’s hard to say that he benefitted more than they did. And not much money changed hands.\nThe Trump Organization has recently signed or completed some deals to license the President’s name for real-estate projects that extended the company’s “Apprentice”-era business model. Before the President took office in 2017, a businessman and politician in Indonesia had licensed the Trump name for two golf projects. One opened in 2025; the other is still in the works. A longtime Trump Organization partner in India is adding six Trump residential projects to the four that predated Trump’s election. Indians evidently wanted to live in Trump towers even when he was just a fading reality-television star.\nA recent rush of Saudi investments in Trump-branded real estate in the Gulf, however, would be hard to fathom without the Trump Presidencies. By 2020, with Trump’s image tarnished by his tumultuous political career, many developers saw less economic value in his name than they once had. The number of international developers paying to license his name had fallen to five, down from eleven before he ran for President.\nBut in November, 2022, Trump, after becoming the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, announced an anomalous new deal. Dar Al Arkan, a Saudi real-estate company, had agreed to pay the Trump Organization to manage both a Trump hotel and a Trump golf course at a vast cliffside development in Muscat, Oman. In addition, Trump would likely get a cut from sales of villas surrounding the course. (The Sultan of Oman is also a partner.) The project, when completed, will be the Trump Organization’s first hotel-management deal overseas. Small-scale managers like the Trump Organization—which currently runs just eight hotels—can typically land only ten-year contracts. But the Oman project reportedly made a three-decade commitment. Developers tend to grant such terms to behemoths like Hilton or Marriott, whose scale enables them to lower costs and attract customers in ways that the Trumps never could.\nIn the months after Trump’s reëlection, Donald, Jr., and Eric signed a blitz of licensing deals with the same Saudi company, for major projects in Riyadh, Jeddah, Dubai, and Doha. Given that the family has acknowledged trying for decades to plant the Trump flag in the Gulf, these mega-deals are inconceivable without Trump’s Presidency.\nHow much are they all paying? After the pandemic, the financial performance of the Dubai golf course stabilized. Trump reported on his last three annual disclosure forms that managing the course paid him $1,283,889, $1,109,950, and $1,078,967. He now stands to make at least a million dollars a year as long as Sajwani renews the management contract—and Sajwani would be foolish to cancel while Trump is President. I estimated that Trump, by the end of his second term, will have made more than nine million dollars from managing that course.\nGolf-industry experts say that, in effect, the Trump Organization merely oversees the local operations of the club and probably keeps more than eighty per cent of those fees as profit. That would net Trump about $7.2 million. In addition, the licensing fees from the Dubai golf course which Trump reported on his last three disclosure forms totalled $9.7 million; much of this money likely comes from his cut of sales of condos around the course. Such fees are usually almost all profit.\nTrump’s new Gulf deals are even more lucrative. Although the Oman project isn’t scheduled to open until 2028, Trump has reported on his three most recent annual disclosure forms a total of $8.8 million in licensing income from it; this presumably includes a cut of villa presales.\nHe will also manage new golf courses in Muscat, Riyadh, and Doha; extrapolating from the one in Dubai, these three could bring in more than $24 million in profit in their first ten years. (Present value: $19 million.) Moreover, Trump’s name will hang on four other new condo or villa projects, in Riyadh, Jeddah, Dubai, and Doha. Taking the average of his licensing fees from the similar projects in Dubai and Muscat, we might estimate that each one brings in nine million dollars in profit in the first three years of sales—for a total of $36 million. (He recently reported five million dollars in licensing fees just a few months after announcing the Dar Al Arkan project in Dubai, suggesting even higher profits.)\nAnother prize will be the management and licensing fees from planned hotels at the projects in Dubai and Muscat. Because the Trumps had never managed an overseas hotel before, I looked at the income from a Trump-branded hotel in Honolulu. Before its owners took down his name, it typically brought him about two million dollars a year in licensing and management fees, according to his financial-disclosure forms. Assuming thirty-year deals at both Gulf hotels and extrapolating from the Hawaiian model, managing the two hotels for the full term might bring in $120 million in fees.\nTo break out Trump’s bottom line, I spoke to Dan Wasiolek, a hospitality analyst at Morningstar, an investment-research firm. (He has been willing to speak publicly about the Trump Organization’s finances; many prefer to avoid the President’s wrath.) Wasiolek told me that a typical profit margin on hotel-management fees is about sixty-five per cent. That would net Trump $78 million (present value: $42 million)—but he’ll probably make much more, because some of that is all-profit licensing income. In all, the Gulf projects that the Trump Organization has signed since 2022 are worth at least $105.8 million.\nEstimated gain: $105.8 million\nRunning total: $678.5 million\nTHE PRIVATE JET\nIn May, the President returned from formal state visits to Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., and Qatar with his most unusual deal so far, one without any pretense of a sale. He announced that the Emir of Qatar had agreed to make a “free gift” of a royal Boeing 747-8 for Trump’s use as a flashy Presidential jet. Trump characterized the transfer as a boon for American taxpayers: the Air Force would retain ownership of the plane until he left office. Yet Trump also said that the Pentagon would then pass the jet to his Presidential-library foundation. This “free gift” looked enough like a personal favor that the Emir has requested a memorandum of understanding confirming that it’s a donation from one government to another, in order to protect him from allegations of bribery. He also wants it in writing that Qatar didn’t propose the handover, and made it only at the President’s request. (A Qatari official told me that negotiations are ongoing.)\nIn the end, Trump may never get to enjoy it. Upgrading the plane to meet Presidential-security requirements could cost more than a billion dollars, which would normally require appropriation by Congress, and the work might not be finished before Trump leaves office. Still, on May 21st, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced that he’d accepted the jet.\nThe Qataris bought the plane from Boeing thirteen years ago. Its list price was $367 million. The Times reported that it might sell on the used-jet market for a hundred and fifty million. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told me in an e-mail that “any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws.” But it’s risible to suggest that the jet would have been offered to any President but Trump. Perhaps the Gulf rulers see such transactions as a form of insurance—a way to avoid the kind of hardship that befell Qatar during Trump’s first Administration. The payments may also have bought good will. Trump, standing near Mohammed bin Salman on the recent trip to Saudi Arabia, unexpectedly announced that he would end sanctions against Syria—currently led by a former Al Qaeda fighter who is trying to prove that he has reformed. “Oh, what I do for the crown prince,” Trump reflected aloud. During his first term, Trump had disappointed the Arab Gulf rulers by declining to retaliate against their regional nemesis, Iran, after an attack on the Saudi oil-processing facility at Abqaiq. In June, when Trump ordered air strikes on Iran, the Arab monarchs surely cheered.\nEstimated gain: $150 million\nRunning total: $828.5 million\nTRUMP HOTEL HANOI\nIn September, 2024, with polls forecasting Trump’s likely return to office, Tô Lâm, the General Secretary of Vietnam’s ruling Communist Party, visited New York and dispatched a Central Committee member to wrap up a Trump resort deal. The Central Committee member oversaw the signing of an agreement between the Party committee of Hung Yen Province and a consortium of investors arranged by the Trump Organization. The same day, Trump took time away from the campaign to join Eric in signing an agreement with a Vietnamese company, known for its office parks, that will build the property and pay the Trumps for the use of their name. The planned development, with a projected cost of $1.5 billion, will include a hotel, residences, and fifty-four holes of golf, occupying an area three times the size of Central Park. It appears to be the largest Trump-branded development in the world.\nTrump’s past levies on imports from China spurred businesses to shift operations to Vietnam, and exports to the U.S. now account for about a third of Vietnam’s economy. Trump’s protectionist tariffs therefore pose both a threat and an opportunity to Vietnam, giving it a singular incentive to cultivate his good will.\nPerhaps with that in mind, Vietnamese authorities have expedited the resort project, overriding local laws and procedures. In a letter obtained by the Times, Vietnamese officials said that they were accelerating the project because it is “receiving special attention from the Trump Administration and President Donald Trump personally.”\nWould this deal have happened in this form if Trump had retired to Mar-a-Lago in 2021? Unlikely. On his most recent financial-disclosure form, Trump reported five million dollars in initial income from licensing his name to the project, which is expected to open in 2027. The development’s huge scale and the unique character of the Vietnamese market make projecting profits difficult. Even if the deal extends for just ten years and the Trump Organization makes only as much each year as it did in the first few months, that will be fifty million dollars. (Present value: $40 million.) Judging from other Trump licensing deals, the actual profits will likely be higher.\nIn July, Trump said that he had reached a provisional trade agreement with Vietnam. He had been threatening a forty-six-per-cent tariff, but he said that the new deal lowered that to twenty per cent. The Vietnamese, contradicting him, have insisted that they are negotiating for an even lower rate.\nEstimated gain: $40 million\nRunning total: $868.5 million\nTHE CORPORATE SQUEEZE\nIn a 2016 law-review article, Susan Seager, a First Amendment lawyer and a professor at the University of California, Irvine School of Law, described Trump as a “libel loser.” In the past five decades, he has lost or withdrawn a dozen suits against media companies, and failed to follow through on many other threats. The handful of claims that he filed after leaving the White House all seemed certain to end similarly. Last spring, for example, he sued ABC News for defamation because its anchor George Stephanopoulos said that a court had found Trump “liable for rape.” The court had found Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming E. Jean Carroll, and the judge had emphasized that Carroll had not failed to prove “that Mr. Trump ‘raped’ her as many people commonly understand the word.” To win his lawsuit, Trump would have to prove that Stephanopoulos spoke with “actual malice”—a seemingly insurmountable burden.\nBut after the election ABC News, a unit of Disney, abruptly settled the case. Confronting a plaintiff who now held enormous sway over its future regulation, Disney agreed to pay fifteen million dollars to Trump’s Presidential-library foundation—the same nonprofit that will presumably take ownership of the Qatari jet.\nTrump also sued Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. After January 6, 2021, Meta, having concluded that he’d used its platforms to incite violence, suspended his accounts. His suit’s tenuous claim was that Meta had somehow violated his First Amendment rights by yielding to pressure from Democratic officials. Yet, a month after ABC’s payment, Meta settled, too, paying $22 million to Trump’s “library.” Then X, formerly known as Twitter and now owned by Elon Musk, reportedly paid about ten million dollars to settle a similar suit. (X has not said whether the company is paying the nonprofit or Trump himself.) In July, CBS News, a unit of Paramount, agreed to pay the nonprofit sixteen million dollars to settle a lawsuit over which snippets of an interview with Kamala Harris it had chosen to broadcast.\nMedia-law experts considered all of Trump’s recent claims ridiculous. Trump appears to be the first sitting President or Presidential nominee in American history to sue for libel or defamation. Such contests could never be fair—a sitting President holds too much power over any defendant. “None of these companies would have settled if Trump weren’t President and wielding power over mergers and regulations and government contracts,” Seager said. Yet most of the settlements, like the Qatari jet, were paid to Trump’s foundation. Should they count as personal profits?\nTwenty-five years ago, President Bill Clinton endured an epic scandal related to a much smaller contribution to a similar nonprofit. Denise Rich, a Democratic donor, gave four hundred and fifty thousand dollars to his Presidential-library foundation, and Clinton, on his final day in office, pardoned her ex-husband, Marc Rich, a tax dodger and a sanctions evader who’d fled to Switzerland. Presidents George W. Bush, Obama, and Biden followed stricter procedures to avoid any appearance of selling a pardon, even for campaign donations. Trump has had no such qualms. The Times reported that he pardoned Paul Walczak, another wealthy tax evader, shortly after Walczak’s mother paid a million dollars to attend a Trump fund-raiser. Walczak’s pardon application reportedly cited his mother’s contributions to Trump and to other Republicans.\nThe Walczak payments, though, were political funds, which politicians cannot use as personal piggy banks. Presidential-library foundations have far fewer restrictions. The board of the Trump-library foundation consists of one of his lawyers, one of his sons, and one of his sons-in-law. The foundation needs only to adhere to the purpose stated in its articles of incorporation: “To preserve and steward the legacy of President Donald J. Trump.” Harvey P. Dale, who heads the N.Y.U. School of Law’s National Center on Philanthropy and the Law, told me that Trump’s foundation couldn’t simply transfer its money to Trump or his sons. But it could feasibly pay for Trump to travel the world. It might even be able to pay him directly, as an adviser. (After all, who knows better how to steward his legacy?) Trevor Potter, the president of the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center and a Republican former chairman of the F.E.C., told me that Trump’s foundation “will constitute an additional account that the former President will control and can use to benefit his post-Presidential life style.” That’s why I counted the Qatari jet as personal profit. The same applies to the settlement payments.\nWith another media giant, Amazon, the Trumps worked more directly. In December, over dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Melania Trump pitched Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chairman, on a documentary that she hoped to produce about her return to the White House. The competition for the rights was flaccid: the Wall Street Journal reported that Disney had offered fourteen million dollars; Netflix and Apple had declined to bid. But Amazon agreed to pay forty million dollars. Of course, former Presidents and their wives routinely earn gigantic advances for memoirs. Yet First Couples have customarily waited until they’ve left office to open those auctions, avoiding the appearance that they might be selling influence. Amazon’s data-center business and Bezos’s Blue Origin space-travel company both receive billions of dollars in government contracts. Melania Trump’s cut of Amazon’s payment is reportedly about $28 million.\nEstimated gain: $91 million\nRunning total: $959.5 million\nTRUTH SOCIAL\nIn October, 2021, Trump announced a plan to launch his own social-media platform, Truth Social. The social-media market was crowded. Yet Trump, who had formed a shell company for the platform, said that he had already agreed to a lucrative merger. His shell company was combining with Digital World Acquisition Corp., a financial contrivance called a special-purpose acquisition company. spacs, a Wall Street fad at the time, are also known as blank-check companies. A spac’s sponsor raises capital through an initial public offering of shares in an empty vessel that operates no business at all. The offering sells only a pledge that the spac will use its funding to buy some enticing enterprise. Digital World, headed by a Miami financier friendly with Trump, had raised $293 million, and it agreed to put that money into a merger with the Truth Social shell. The combined company, now called Trump Media & Technology Group, then handed Trump a roughly sixty-per-cent stake and named him its chairman. His share of the $293 million was equivalent to $175 million. (In a press release, Trump Media projected that, on the stock market, the combined company would be worth $1.7 billion, making the President’s stake worth more than a billion dollars.)\nIn retrospect, this chain of promises looks like a watershed moment in Trump’s evolution from builder to entertainer to pitchman to political entrepreneur. At each stage, he has hawked products that are harder and harder to measure or touch.\nAny money that the President makes from Trump Media unquestionably depends on his status as the former and current Commander-in-Chief. The company’s customer base is the MAGA movement. And Trump releases news-making Presidential statements exclusively through Truth Social, exploiting his public position to draw attention to his private platform. But how much of that apparent $175 million Trump might pocket is a trickier question. Trump Media’s market value has gyrated with its share price, ranging from as high as six billion dollars to as low as $1.6 billion.\nTrump Media lost more than four hundred million dollars last year, and in each of the past four quarters the company has brought in only about a million dollars or less in revenue. It has never shared a convincing plan for making Truth Social profitable. Institutional investors call it a meme stock; that is, Trump Media’s share price fluctuates with small investors’ feelings about Trump, regardless of any underlying value. If Trump tried to cash out, he’d undoubtedly set off a stampede that would trample the stock’s price before he could make off with much.\nThis past spring, I asked Dubinsky, the forensic accountant, to estimate how much Truth Social had added to Trump’s wealth. Applying metrics used to evaluate other social-media companies, such as daily users (it has about four hundred thousand), Dubinsky put the value of Trump’s stake at between four million and twenty million dollars. Though he considered twenty million “very generous,” to be charitable he suggested adding another five million, putting Trump’s stake at about $25 million. He commented, “I personally would never invest in it.” (In response to detailed questions, Trump Media & Technology Group declined to answer and threatened to sue.)\nEstimated gain: $25 million\nRunning total: $984.5 million\n1789 CAPITAL\nOn January 31st, Ned’s Club, a chain of luxury social clubs with locations in London, New York, and Doha, opened an outpost near the White House. Ned’s is owned by the investor Ronald Burkle, a Democratic donor, who is also the chairman and majority shareholder in Soho House, a kind of sister company. The Washington Ned’s is a joint venture with Michael Milken, the financier who was convicted in 1990 of securities fraud and pardoned in 2020 by Trump. Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump adviser, sits on the club’s membership committee. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have reportedly been seen there.\nRegular members pay a five-thousand-dollar entry fee plus five thousand dollars a year; élite members can pay as much as a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars up front and twenty-five thousand a year for access to all Ned’s and Soho House locations. The D.C. Ned’s, which occupies the top three stories of a historic building, has a leafy roof deck overlooking the Mall, three restaurants, and a capacious library that serves cocktails at night.\nIn April, Donald, Jr., circulated plans for a rival club, Executive Branch, which would initially cap its membership at two hundred people, and charge an initiation fee of up to half a million dollars. A person involved in the club told me that twenty “founding members” paid the half-million-dollar fee; regular members paid closer to a hundred thousand. Donald, Jr., formed the club with his friend Omeed Malik, who is a financier, a Trump donor, and a Mar-a-Lago member; Zack and Alex Witkoff, the sons of President Trump’s old friend and current diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff; and Christopher Buskirk, a conservative writer who is also a Malik associate. Malik told the Washington Post that friends from the 2024 Trump campaign “wanted to be able to catch up when our paths crossed in D.C.,” adding that Executive Branch’s founders sought an “experience comparable to the finest social clubs in the world.” He said that its élite members don’t need to pay for access because they are “already plugged in.” He called the club’s name “tongue in cheek.”\nHow do Donald, Jr., and his partners plan to compete against Ned’s? Malik, in addition to offering a MAGA-friendly atmosphere, has promised to bar journalists and lobbyists. (An exception was made for Jeff Miller, a lobbyist who is a friend of the founders and paid half a million.) The person involved also said that Executive Branch has recruited a renowned chef and a team from Carriage House, a club in Palm Beach. Malik told the Washington Post that the club will provide multiple lounge areas and a mezzanine V.I.P. section, creating the atmosphere of an elegant mansion. The New York Post reported that Executive Branch had spent ten million dollars on art. Yet it’s hard to imagine all that opulence in the venue that the partners have leased: a reported nine-thousand-square-foot subterranean space beneath an unexceptional condominium on a busy avenue in Georgetown, next to a TJ Maxx and an office of the Department of Motor Vehicles. Until March, the space housed a series of bars that struggled to keep out underage drinkers.\nExecutive Branch held a soft opening for founders in June, and then closed again for the summer, to make final renovations. Perhaps the new club has pulled off an interior-design miracle. Even so, its biggest draw is surely the offer of intimacy with the President’s family and their associates. The soft opening drew at least seven Cabinet secretaries.\nDonald, Jr.,’s stake in Executive Branch hasn’t been disclosed, and the club’s bottom line is difficult to forecast. (Its ability to attract members after Trump leaves the actual executive branch is even more speculative.) The person involved told me that the founders saw the club as a “social vanity project,” comparable to the way many rich people dabble in the arts, and “not a money-making venture at all.” Still, the two hundred memberships have already sold. If twenty founding members paid half a million dollars and the rest paid a hundred thousand dollars, Executive Branch has already generated twenty-eight million. A deluxe renovation of the space, even at the extravagant cost of a thousand dollars a square foot, would still leave more than nineteen million. Given that association with the Trumps and their circle defines the club, Donald, Jr., would be foolish to expect less than a fifth of any profits. That would amount to more than $3.8 million before the club opens. But the person involved, listing various costs, made a strong case that running a high-end club is likely to burn through that sum quickly. Until it opens, then, Executive Branch’s profits remain hypothetical.\nMalik has also paid Donald, Jr., in other ways. In the past several years, investment vehicles founded by Malik have acquired at least one company in which Donald, Jr., had already invested: PublicSquare, an “anti-woke” online marketplace. And Donald, Jr., was an adviser to an online gun retailer, GrabAGun, and received a stake—currently worth about two million dollars—as part of its acquisition by a Malik investment vehicle. Last fall, Malik made Donald, Jr., a partner in a venture-capital firm he co-founded, 1789 Capital, which looks to apply high-tech solutions to government failures and to exploit opportunities neglected by “woke” thinking. They have raised about a billion dollars for the company’s first fund, from such investors as the conservative mega-donor Rebekah Mercer. A person familiar with 1789 Capital’s fund-raising told me that the firm has also sought investors from the Persian Gulf. The firm backs only U.S. startups, and it has acquired minority stakes in several companies that are affected by the decisions of the federal government, including defense contractors. (Malik has stressed that nobody at the firm has ever worked with the federal government, and that it publicly discloses all its investments.)\nIt’s unlikely that Donald, Jr.,’s experience at the Trump Organization would have landed him any similar job in the venture-capital industry had his father never entered the White House. He hasn’t disclosed any of his compensation. But John Gannon, the chief executive of Venture5, a media company focussed on the venture-capital industry which conducts surveys of compensation, told me, “If Trump, Jr., is splitting his time between 1789 and his other responsibilities, it’s not unreasonable to assume a low-six-figure annual salary”—upward of two hundred thousand dollars. Most firms, by the end of a typical ten-year life span, at least double the capital they’ve invested. Under standard industry terms, the 1789 partners would then divide at least two hundred million dollars in profits. The firm’s website lists Donald, Jr., as the third among seven partners, after Malik and Buskirk. Gannon estimated that Donald, Jr.,’s share of those profits would be about ten per cent, so he might eventually take home at least twenty million dollars (present value: $16 million), in addition to a two-hundred-thousand-dollar salary (present value: $1.6 million). Excluding any provisional profits so far from the “social vanity project,” Donald, Jr.,’s take from 1789 and GrabAGun adds $19.6 million.\nEstimated gain: $19.6 million\nRunning total: $1 billion\n\nEric Trump, the public face of the Trump Organization while his father is in office, often says that his family first “fell in love with crypto” in the years after the Capitol riot. Big banks dropped the Trumps—including Deutsche Bank, their most important lender, and Capital One, where the Trump Organization had hundreds of accounts. At a recent crypto conference, Eric framed this blackballing, as he often does, as an example of bias against “a political view that might not have been popular with some of the big financial institutions.” He also described his family’s embrace of digital finance as a form of revenge: “The banks made the biggest mistake of their lives.”\nLike many boosters of crypto, Eric sometimes struggles to explain what it’s good for, aside from crime and casino-like speculation. Cryptocurrency essentially refers to marks in an online ledger called a blockchain, which tracks the contents of digital wallets. The blockchain is like a giant spreadsheet in the sky—though, as the journalist Zeke Faux notes in his terrific account of the crypto boom, “Number Go Up,” its promoters often talk as if the system’s “incomprehensibility was almost a selling point.”\nA hot topic among crypto investors is the question of a “use case.” At the recent conference, Eric responded to this by complaining, not for the first time, that it took him a hundred days to close a home mortgage: “Can you imagine how punitive that is to the average person out there that might not have our resources or might not have our net worth, you know, filling out paper forms?” Sometimes he gripes that Trump Organization executives still have to worry about getting large wire transfers done before banks close, at 5 p.m. “How, in 2025, could that possibly be the case?” he has said. “Crypto solves all these problems.” But outdated technology isn’t what slows down mortgage applications or big wire transfers; it’s the due diligence that banks perform to address the riskiness of a loan or the legitimacy of a payment. Molly White, a software engineer and a prominent skeptic of digital finance, told me that, for many boosters, getting around anti-money-laundering laws and other regulations appears to be the main appeal of crypto.\nIndeed, criminals love crypto. The decentralized nature of that spreadsheet in the sky, maintained by a vast network of computers, makes it difficult to hold anyone accountable for unlawful transfers. Plus, each digital wallet is anonymous, identified by a string of letters and numbers, and often protected only by a hackable password. For years, the best-proved use case was Silk Road, a bitcoin-enabled black market in narcotics, hacking services, and other illicit transactions. In 2015, a federal court sentenced its founder, Ross Ulbricht, to life in prison for drug distribution, money laundering, and other crimes, and forced him to forfeit $183 million. Ulbricht reigned as the crypto-criminal GOAT until last year, when a court ordered the crypto savant Sam Bankman-Fried, a founder of the exchange FTX, to surrender eleven billion dollars in fraudulent gains.\nTrump initially saw crypto with clear eyes. In 2019, he tweeted that the volatile prices of cryptocurrencies were “based on thin air,” and that “unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior.” As recently as 2021, he told an interviewer that crypto “seems like a scam.” FTX’s spectacular collapse, the following year, appeared to vindicate his warning.\nBut by then he’d got into the game. At the time, celebrity endorsements had driven a frenzy of speculation for non-fungible tokens, or N.F.T.s, which are essentially marks on that spreadsheet in the sky proving that a buyer has paid, often dearly, to own a digital image. Trump was reportedly introduced to the concept by Bill Zanker, the entrepreneur behind the Learning Annex. (Zanker had paid Trump to lecture about getting rich in real estate, and in 2007 the two men co-authored a book, “Think Big and Kick Ass: In Business and in Life.”) If Snoop Dogg and Paris Hilton were selling N.F.T.s, Zanker must have reasoned, why not Trump?\nIn Trump’s progression from brick-and-mortar developer to hawker of intangible projections of himself, his N.F.T.s were another milestone. They depicted him as a muscled superhero in a cape, a guitar-wielding biker, and so on, and on Truth Social he announced that they cost “only $99 each!” On his past three disclosure forms, Trump reported that he had earned $13,180,707 in N.F.T.-licensing fees. The forms also show that Melania Trump made $1,224,311 from licensing an N.F.T.\nEstimated gain: $14.4 million\nRunning total: $1.02 billion\nTOKEN INVESTMENTS\nTrump collected some of his N.F.T. fees in the form of digital currency, giving him his first incentive to start talking it up. In December, 2023, Arkham, a research firm, reported that a digital wallet linked to Trump held about four million dollars’ worth of crypto. On his most recent disclosure form, Trump reported that his digital wallet contained at least a million dollars’ worth of crypto.\nTrump, in contrast with Eric, has said that his love affair with crypto began in 2024. At a bitcoin conference that July, he warned the audience that “most people have no idea what the hell it is—you know that, right?” But his Presidential campaign had begun receiving big contributions in crypto. If he still sounded hazy about how it all worked, he nonetheless promised the conference attendees that he’d make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet.” He also repeated a pledge to free Silk Road’s Ulbricht. (In January, Trump pardoned Ulbricht.)\nAround the time of that conference, Donald, Jr., and Eric started dropping hints about a new crypto venture of their own. It formally appeared in September, 2024, under the name World Liberty Financial. The company entered a sector known as “decentralized finance” that involves the borrowing, lending, and trading of cryptocurrency. Competitors already filled the field, and nobody at World Liberty had a successful track record in decentralized finance. The startup offered few details about its plans, saying only that it would begin selling digital tokens that entitled a buyer to vote, at some point, on what its future plans would entail. The tokens somewhat resembled stock certificates, except that they conferred no share of the company’s profits, couldn’t be sold or transferred, and came under scant government regulatio","summary":"An honest accounting of our Executive-in-Chief’s runaway self-enrichment.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/08/18/the-number","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6896473f741d292225a2c8cf/16:9/w_1488,h_837,c_limit/r47269_RD.gif","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-11 10:00:00","author":"David D.

She did not answer either way and merely joked: \"Because of my Instagram posts?\"Ocasio-Cortez had posted what some considered to be a campaign-style video on social media in April. It showed clips of a recent tour she did with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.Pressed further, she said: \"Look, it's a video.

It's a danger and that's really what my central focus is.\"\"To me, this moment is not about campaigns or elections or about politics.

That might be news to you given the City of Brotherly Love—now a relatively placid place—was known during that era for its gang-related murders and social dysfunction. It was news to residents, too, given that the streets felt so menacing. But why argue with statistics?\n\nA year after law-and-order populist Mayor Frank Rizzo won his election to clean up Philly, he bragged about the drop in crime. But as news reports made clear at the time, the administration likely gamed the statistics by reclassifying serious crimes as simple assault. “The chances of being victimized on the street are much greater now than ever before,” a top criminologist told The New York Times in 1973.\n\nI thought of that experience in the light of Donald Trump—and not just because his divisive style mirrors Rizzo. Last week, Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It’s a statistical job, which oversees the compilation of economic data about jobs, labor costs and productivity. The BLS reports to the labor secretary, but operates independently.\n\nTrump didn’t like the latest jobs report, which showed meager jobs growth as the nation heads toward a tariff-imposed recession. “I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,” posted Trump on social media. He called her numbers “RIGGED.” Never mind that BLS jobs data—released before the November election—offered bad news for Kamala Harris.\n\nAs with any bureaucracy, the agency is fair game for criticism. BLS has plenty of flaws. But we know how Trump and MAGA play the game: Any results that are good for them are the truth—and anything not to their liking is evidence of rigging or conspiracy-. Their take on any news is the one that advances their interests.\n\nI’ve seen this before, especially when my daughter was playing youth soccer. Honest teams accepted referees’ verdicts (even when we thought they got it wrong). Some other teams insisted every call should go their way—and bullied the referees who disagreed. Those teams usually were the ones that had no problem cheating. But it’s hard to play the game without ground rules.\n\nLikewise, the feds need an independent body to analyze statistics. The New York Times quoted Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell: “Good data helps not just the Fed, it helps the government, but it also helps the private sector.” Trump has indicated he’d like to replace Powell—presumably with someone who will juice interest rates to help his political goals. Any intelligent person, though, can see why good policy flows from an accurate understanding of reality.\n\nThese are banana republic moves, backed by MAGA and the Banana Republican Party. Had any Democratic president tried to so directly politicize these independent agencies Republicans would be screaming about the coming tyranny. Democrats aren’t immune to politicizing independent bodies—consider the troublesome plan to expand the U.S. Supreme Court—but they didn’t dare meddle in statistical counting.\n\nConsider how budget matters are handled in Democratic-dominated California. The governor issues his budget and revenue/deficit predictions, which of course make the most optimistic projections. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office does its analysis, which typically is less sanguine. The governor might take issue with those results—but he doesn’t try to remove the head of the LAO and replace him with a political hack who issues only good news.\n\nIn national or state economies, reality always sets in anyway. That’s why it’s odd that despots always try so hard to control the economic data. The Times points to other countries that have done this, such as formerly populist Argentina. In that case, “the international community eventually stopped relying on the government’s data,” which “drove up the country’s borrowing costs, worsening a debt crisis that ultimately led to it defaulting on its international obligations.”\n\nWe’re all used to this administration “defining deviancy down,” as we all lower our standards for acceptable presidential behavior (free jet from Qatar, anyone?). So I guess this will be just another deviant action that the Republican Party will eagerly defend. Let’s not even worry about it. This is the best economy we’ve ever seen in the history of the world and jobs growth is the greatest. Soon enough, the official statistics will prove it.\n\nSteven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute and a member of the Southern California News Group editorial board.

The BLS reports to the labor secretary, but operates independently.\n\nTrump didn’t like the latest jobs report, which showed meager jobs growth as the nation heads toward a tariff-imposed recession. “I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,” posted Trump on social media. He called her numbers “RIGGED.” Never mind that BLS jobs data—released before the November election—offered bad news for Kamala Harris.\n\nAs with any bureaucracy, the agency is fair game for criticism. BLS has plenty of flaws. But we know how Trump and MAGA play the game: Any results that are good for them are the truth—and anything not to their liking is evidence of rigging or conspiracy-. Their take on any news is the one that advances their interests.\n\nI’ve seen this before, especially when my daughter was playing youth soccer. Honest teams accepted referees’ verdicts (even when we thought they got it wrong). Some other teams insisted every call should go their way—and bullied the referees who disagreed. Those teams usually were the ones that had no problem cheating. But it’s hard to play the game without ground rules.\n\nLikewise, the feds need an independent body to analyze statistics. The New York Times quoted Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell: “Good data helps not just the Fed, it helps the government, but it also helps the private sector.” Trump has indicated he’d like to replace Powell—presumably with someone who will juice interest rates to help his political goals. Any intelligent person, though, can see why good policy flows from an accurate understanding of reality.\n\nThese are banana republic moves, backed by MAGA and the Banana Republican Party. Had any Democratic president tried to so directly politicize these independent agencies Republicans would be screaming about the coming tyranny. Democrats aren’t immune to politicizing independent bodies—consider the troublesome plan to expand the U.S. Supreme Court—but they didn’t dare meddle in statistical counting.\n\nConsider how budget matters are handled in Democratic-dominated California. The governor issues his budget and revenue/deficit predictions, which of course make the most optimistic projections. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office does its analysis, which typically is less sanguine. The governor might take issue with those results—but he doesn’t try to remove the head of the LAO and replace him with a political hack who issues only good news.\n\nIn national or state economies, reality always sets in anyway. That’s why it’s odd that despots always try so hard to control the economic data. The Times points to other countries that have done this, such as formerly populist Argentina. In that case, “the international community eventually stopped relying on the government’s data,” which “drove up the country’s borrowing costs, worsening a debt crisis that ultimately led to it defaulting on its international obligations.”\n\nWe’re all used to this administration “defining deviancy down,” as we all lower our standards for acceptable presidential behavior (free jet from Qatar, anyone?). So I guess this will be just another deviant action that the Republican Party will eagerly defend. Let’s not even worry about it. This is the best economy we’ve ever seen in the history of the world and jobs growth is the greatest. Soon enough, the official statistics will prove it.\n\nSteven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute and a member of the Southern California News Group editorial board.

Yet, people do listen to this eccentric elder who, after not succeeding as a carpenter, ventured into politics, remained there, and amassed wealth through it. CNN’s Dana Bash listens to him:\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., criticized former Vice President Kamala Harris and her campaign on Sunday, highlighting their susceptibility to influence from affluent individuals in 2024 and their failure to address working families’ issues.\nCNN’s “State of the Union” host Dana Bash questioned Sanders regarding a statement he made during one of his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour events about the former vice president.\nBash played a clip of Sanders addressing an audience, saying, “In my opinion, one of the reasons Kamala Harris lost this election is because she had too many billionaires advising her not to advocate for the working-class in this country.”\nThe CNN host reacted to the clip and said, “ouch.”\n\nLet’s be frank, there were numerous reasons Kamala Harris lost the (2024) election, and having too many billionaires advising her wasn’t among the top ten – or even the top 500. She primarily lost because her personality is abrasive and grating, her cackling laugh is off-putting, she possesses all the charm and charisma of a carbuncle, and candidly, she’s not particularly intelligent. She ran an exceptionally poor presidential campaign, and she faced an opponent who genuinely appealed to the working class – by promising jobs, by ensuring boys wouldn’t play against working-class girls in sports or enter their locker rooms, by promising affordable gasoline, and by pledging to expel millions of illegal immigrants from our country – and he’s delivering on these promises.\n\nWe might also remember that Bernie used to complain about millionaires until he became one (remember that net worth? $15 million). Now he complains about billionaires. He’s the very definition of a one-trick pony.\n\nBut here’s the really funny part of the Bash interview:\n\n“I think the clue to Democratic victories is to understand that you’ve got to stand unequivocally with the working class of this country. You need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working people,” Sanders said. \n“Is it [a] radical idea to say that in the midst of a competitive global economy, we need to make sure we have the best educated workforce that all of our kids, regardless of income, should be able to get a higher education? These ideas exist all over the world. They don’t exist in America, and they don’t exist because of the power of the oligarchs, economically and politically,” he said. \n\nBernie is, and always has been, deficient in the “clue” department.

When asked about reports that the Palestinian population is starving to death, Huckabee answered: “Oh, I think that there are certainly people suffering in Gaza. It’s happening because Hamas has not allowed the food to get to the people who are hungry.”\n\nAfter Patta said CBS “spoke to the World Food Program” and that the organization has “not shown evidence” of food theft by Hamas, Huckabee added, “I’m shocked they would say that.”\n\nHe then touted the work of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a Donald Trump-endorsed non-profit founded in February that has been tasked with distributing aid to Palestinians. “The GHF sites are effective and they are getting food to people. It’s not perfect, but it’s doing what President Trump required us to ask us to do that was set up through GHF,” Huckabee said.\n\n“Get food to people but in a way that Hamas can’t do it. But GHF has no ability to verify who is getting that food. How do we know that those people aren’t from Hamas? You can’t absolutely guarantee that they’re not. But there’s zero verification process.”\n\nIn July, United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) director of philanthropy Hani Almadhoun told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes that GHF is made up of “mercenaries who are hired with big pay and brought into Gaza to shoot the people who are being starved.”\n\nThe narrative Huckabee suggested on Friday is also reminiscent of Trump’s October 2024 claims that CBS edited an interview with presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Trump specifically insisted the network intentionally edited her response to a question about Gaza and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nParamount eventually reached a $16 million settlement with Trump over the lawsuit, covering both plaintiffs’ fees and costs as well as a donation that will be allocated to a future presidential library.

In fact, mostly, things are grimly serious, the sort of seriousness that comes with solid, never-questioned self-importance. But sometimes that professional pomposity reaches a tipping point when strenuous efforts to be very earnest involuntarily produce priceless outcomes.\n\nThat is the case with a recent elephantine op-ed that has surfaced in Politico under the illustrious names of Gabrielius Landsbergis and Garry Kasparov. Its one, relentlessly reiterated argument is touchingly simple as well as out of touch with the world we really live in: The EU, this fantasy goes, is too consensual, peaceful, and nice (tell the migrants drowning in the Mediterranean or traded as slaves in Libya with de facto EU support). It must become tough, decisive, and fierce, with plenty of arms and gritty oomph. Because otherwise it won’t survive in a world shaped by the big bad “global network of authoritarians” (I won’t enumerate them here; it’s just the usual suspects of every Centrist’s fever dream) and, for good measure, terrorists, too. (Surely, the latter, at least, do no longer include Mr. Jolani, the former leader of the Al Qaeda franchise in Syria who has recently been reborn miraculously as an avatar of diversity now going by Al Sharaa?)\n\nLandsbergis is a political nepo baby, enthusiastic NATO sectarian, and the former foreign minister of Lithuania. While popular at international meet-ups of adult – so they say at least – Europeans calling US presidents “daddy,” a 2023 poll back home in Lithuania saw him fail to breach the 2-percent threshold. If that sounds like perfect material for a blind date with Kamala Harris, Landsbergis certainly has time on his hands after losing his constituency last year and announcing he wanted to take a break from politics. No less, it seems, than his voters clearly needed a break from him.\n\nKasparov is, by comparison with Landsbergis, at least an original phenomenon, the idiot savant of chess. A former world champion, he has now spent decades proving that one can be a chess genius and a perfect dunce in every other respect, especially politics. Since he has combined this obstinate – and almost brave, if that is the word – playing to his worst weaknesses with an equally stubborn obsession with going after Russia and its leadership he still has his fans, in the West.\n\nTogether, Landsbergis and Kasparov have signed off on a gargantuan effort to produce another Long Telegram. Clearly, they are driven by a comically misplaced ambition to best American diplomat and Ur-Cold Warrior’ George Kennan – a complex, dour, and vain man, but certainly no fool, as his later fall from official grace and opposition to daft Western expansionism showed – who issued the renowned call to arms against the Soviet Union in 1946/47.\n\nWhat early Cold War Kennan did for the US – and by extension, its postwar empire – Kasparov and Landsbergis would very much, desperately like to be able to do for the EU. And they have striven mightily. Yet they have strutted into the classical trap of the epigone: think of their imitation clarion call as a mix between embarrassingly poor-but-eager fan fiction, a bizarre alternative history of the EU, and a rambling and rather dull party speech masquerading as an op-ed.\n\nYes, that is how bad it is. Indeed, the screed by the Lithuanian has-been and the chess master who went full blockhead is so self-defeatingly shoddy that it’s difficult to know where to begin. So, for starters, just for a rough sense of what we are dealing with, this is a text asserting the EU systematically promotes politicians who are “excellent negotiators.”\n\nSuch as Ursula von der Leyen, we must assume? The one really in charge (although no one can coherently explain why) in the EU who has just “negotiated” a grotesquely disadvantageous anti-”deal” – really an unconditional surrender without a fight – with the US, built on the elegantly simple principle “You get everything, we get nothing, and we’ll pay you for that as well.”\n\nThis claim about the EU producing excellence at the negotiating table, is all the more curious (Is “curious” the word? Would “symptomatic” be better?) since Landsbergis and Kasparov do mention that recent fiasco at Trump’s Turnberry Golf Berghof as well. Somehow, between the former foreign minister and the former chess champion, no one noticed the contradiction.\n\nBut then again, these are the same bright minds who believe that the EU is a beacon of “free trade.” In reality, one purpose the EU was built for – apart from suppressing national sovereignty and whatever faint elements of democracy postwar European states actually have featured – was to not allow for free trade. In reality, the EU permits something resembling free trade only when it is perceived as advantageous to its own agenda or that of specific states and pressure groups – or, of course, when it is forced to do so.\n\nIn all other cases, it practices a whole plethora of protectionist policies, from the classic Common Agricultural Policy to so-called anti-dumping rules that it uses as geopolitical weapons. It also runs an enormous redistribution scheme between its member nations, something that Landsbergis from Lithuania certainly knows from its most cushy side. While not directly a trade issue, that, too, is far from the pure doctrine of free markets and invisible hands.\n\nFinally, it was, obviously, precisely the EU’s – not Russia’s – refusal to even consider “free” trade for Ukraine with both itself and Russia that played a key role in triggering the original Ukraine crisis of 2013/14.\n\nMore examples of painfully under-informed and under-thought (both polite expressions) statements could be added. But why torment ourselves? You get the gist: Details – though by no means minor – are not Landsbergis and Kasparov’s forte. What about the grand argument then? It is not merely ignorant but positively toxic.\n\nFor Kasparov and Landsbergis, it is certain that the EU and “Putin’s Russia” can never “peacefully coexist,” and while hedging a tiny bit with regard to China, they say essentially the same about the bloc's relationship with Beijing as well. As card-carrying members of the “daddy”-saying club, they let the US off lightly, bending themselves into submissive pretzels by, on one side, noting that it is abandoning its EU vassals and, on the other, saying that that’s okay, daddy, and, anyhow, we Europeans need tough love.\n\nIn effect, they paint a picture of an EU that can rely only on itself. And that is the madness of their article: They are right – even if cowardly – about the fact that it cannot rely on the US. But they are wrong, in fact, deluded, about two key things.\n\nFirst, they are dishonest about “going it alone.” Because they are, of course, not ready to be consistent and encourage the EU to, in that case, actually put its own interests above the demands of the US. The obvious test here is Ukraine. If Landsbergis and Kasparov were ready to face the fact that the EU must end, instead of increase, its support for Kiev, then one could take them seriously to an extent. But the opposite is the case.\n\nSecond, there is no need to “go it alone,” and, in fact, there is no such option. If Kasparov and Landsbergis could free themselves for a moment from their ideological obsessions, they would easily realize that the way forward for the EU in a world where the US has become an even more damaging “friend” than before is to seek normal relationships with others, in particular with China and Russia. In terms of both security and economics, these are the relationships that would allow the EU to perhaps escape decline. Yet driven by provincial phobias and petty personal grudges, Kasparov and Landsbergis miss the obvious.\n\nWhat is profoundly disturbing about their rant is not that it exists: someone will always be full enough of themselves to produce flimsy, atrocious ideas and mistake them for advice to share. Yet in a halfway normal environment, such things would stay on Reddit. That they are treated as worthy of a mainstream platform is a sign that, indeed, the EU has severe problems and needs radical change. Just not along the lines suggested by Landsbergis and Kasparov.","summary":"Two high-ranking gravediggers share their Reddit-level advice on resuscitating the bloc \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/622674-eu-warlike-fevered-minds/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.08/article/689611a32030277299760108.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 19:54:32","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.214},{"id":349903662,"title":"Greg Gutfeld Says ‘It Took Guts’ for Jimmy Fallon to Host Him, Mocks Stephen Colbert – ‘My Uber Driver’ | Video","text":"Greg Gutfeld and Co. took a victory lap for the Fox News host’s appearance last week on “The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon,” with the consensus being that not only was it a fun moment – but something late-night culture needs more of.\n\n“I brought fun by the gallon to our pal Jimmy Fallon,” the “Gutfeld!” [and self-proclaimed king of late night] said on Friday night’s monologue. “It went so well all the way home I could not stop talking about it with my Uber driver [displaying a picture of “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert.] \n\nThe canceled-by-May CBS host, criticized after his exit was announced for never having conservative guests, continued to get roasted as Gutfeld boasted.\n\n“But it was nothing like the critics predicted,” Gutfeld said. “They expected me and Mr. Evil Fox News to attack Jimmy Fallon and they were mad when I did not.

Harris was named the Democratic candidate for president only a handful of months before the election.\n\n“How do you run for president and not develop a strong agenda, which speaks to the economic crises facing working families?” Sanders asked. “You have more income and wealth inequality today than we’ve ever had. You have 60% of our people living paycheck-to-paycheck. You got a healthcare system which is broken and dysfunctional. And despite spending so much, we’re the only major country not to guarantee healthcare all people.”\n\nAfter Bash interjected that Harris spoke “about affordability,” Sanders demurred and said he didn’t “want to rehash that campaign” but does see it as a useful guide for Democrats in the future.\n\n“But I think the clue to Democratic victories is to understand that you got to stand unequivocally with the working class of this country,” he said. “You need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working people.

Sign up for their newsletters.\n\nA few weeks ago, a video popped up on YouTube, purporting to be a verbal clash between Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, and Gov. Gavin Newsom during a congressional hearing.\n\nThe video claimed that Hawley cleaned Newsom’s clock in their debate over a lawsuit that Newsom had filed. The problem is it was fake, created with video snippets of both politicians and a voiceover describing what supposedly happened.\n\nThe video, which has since vanished from YouTube, is a fairly crude example of how technology can be manipulated to depict seemingly real events.\n\nMore sophisticated examples of artificial intelligence, known as deepfakes, can literally put words in political figures’ mouths or even create seemingly real persons.\n\nLast year, Christopher Kohls, going by the name “Mr. Reagan” on social media, posted a video in which Kamala Harris seemingly acknowledged that she had been the “ultimate diversity hire” when Joe Biden chose her as his vice presidential running mate.\n\nKohls said it was a parody, but Elon Musk posted it on his social media platform X, drawing criticism from Newsom and a vow to outlaw such material. It was one of many clashes with Musk, the billionaire electric car and rocket tycoon, after he became a Donald Trump ally.\n\nWithin weeks, Newsom signed two bills aimed at either regulating or banning AI-generated political videos. Kohl, later joined by other content creators, sued, contending that they violate free speech.\n\nLast week John Mendez, a federal judge in Sacramento, struck down one of the measures, Assembly Bill 2655, carried by Assemblyman Marc Berman, a Palo Alto Democrat. He ruled that the federal Communications Decency Act protects X and other sites from liability for material posted by third parties, such as Kohl or Musk.\n\nAB 2655 would have barred internet sites from posting deceptive political material during campaign seasons. “They don’t have anything to do with these videos that the state is objecting to,” Mendez said.\n\nNotably, Mendez indicated that he will also reject the second measure, Assembly Bill 2839, carried by Assemblywoman Gail Pellerin, a Santa Cruz Democrat. It would prohibit anyone from “knowingly distributing an advertisement or other election communication … that contains certain materially deceptive content.”\n\n“I think the statute just fails miserably in accomplishing what it would like to do,” Mendez said, adding “It’s become a censorship law and there is no way that is going to survive.”\n\nAs the country’s political polarization deepens, voters become more willing to believe allegations that those on the other side of the divide are evil, corrupt and power hungry. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence makes political deepfakes ever more sophisticated and capable of fooling gullible voters into believing their lies.\n\nExaggeration, selective facts and downright lies have always been evident in political campaigns, but historically held in check, at least partially, by newspapers and other political media.\n\nUnfortunately, however, the mainstream media have fallen on economic hard times and have become less capable of policing political discourse. Meanwhile, X, YouTube, podcasts and other digital media have exploded as alternative sources but they tend to drive polarization rather than counteract it.\n\nThe bills that Democratic legislators and a Democratic governor enacted last year were clearly aimed at crippling media on the other side of the ideological divide but, as Judge Mendez ruled, violate free speech.\n\nCensorship cannot be the answer. The approach that Newsom and legislators took is a slippery slope that would invite retaliation from their political rivals, thus deepening the already yawning political divide.\n\nIt is, however, a genuine quandary. Unfettered use of AI-driven deepfakes in political campaigns present an obvious peril, but so does any effort to prohibit free speech, no matter how distasteful.\n\nCalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable.\n\nWant to submit a letter to the editor, guest column or opinion piece?

A key progressive voice in the reddest of red states. Senator Bernie Sanders is spending this congressional recess back on what he calls his Fighting Oligarchy Tour, trying to help Democrats find their footing among working-class Americans and reclaim power next November. I hit the road with the senator in West Virginia as he took his message to the heart of Trump country.\n\nIt's good to be with you here. We're in Wheeling, West Virginia. And it's so fascinating that this is part of what you call your Fighting the Oligarchy Tour, because this is a state where Donald Trump got 70 percent.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: Really?\n\nBASH: Seventy percent.\n\nSANDERS: Wouldn't have known that tonight.\n\nBASH: Well, yes. And this was an auditorium that was packed. It was at capacity. Still, what makes you think that your message tonight is going to resonate in such a red state?\n\nSANDERS: Well, among other things, when I ran for president, I think here in West Virginia we won every single county. Look, this is a working-class state. It's one of the poorest states in the country. People are hurting. And they want candidates to come before them to stand up for the working class and take on the oligarchs, who have so much economic and political power. So I think- I think the message will resonate here. I think it will resonate in many red states throughout the country, because, at the end of the day, 60 percent of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. They don't want to see tax breaks for billionaires. They don't want to see the rich get richer. They want health care as a human right. They want to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. They want to be able to live in housing that they can afford.\n\nBASH: One of the things that you talked about here, as you have been talking about since even before it passed, is what the president calls his Big Beautiful Bill, cuts to Medicaid, other programs; 25 percent of West Virginians receive Medicaid; 15 percent rely on food stamps. And yet, as I mentioned, West Virginians overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump. How do you square that circle?\n\nSANDERS: Well, that's a longer story that has to do with the failure of the Democratic Party in general to speak to the needs of the working class. This used to be, decades ago, one of the strongest Democratic states in the country. Now it's a strong Republican state, because I think, in many ways, the Democratic Party has turned its back on what was its space. But I think our job and what -- the reason I'm here and the reason we go to red states all over the country is to make it clear that there are some of us who are prepared to stand up for the working class. And if we become -- if we stand together, if we're united, if we don't let Trump divide us up, there's no stopping what we can do as a nation in terms of improving life for ordinary people.\n\nBASH: You said the Democratic Party has turned its back on the working class. You said something pretty tough when you were speaking to this crowd about Kamala Harris.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSANDERS: One of the reasons, in my view, that Kamala Harris lost the election is, she had too many billionaires telling her not to speak up for the working class of this country. (CHEERING)\n\nBASH: Ouch.\n\nSANDERS: Well, no, I think -- I mean, I don't think that that's -- I like Kamala. She's a friend of mine. But she was -- her core consultants were heavily influenced by very wealthy people. How do you run for president and not develop a strong agenda which speaks to the economic crises facing working families? You have more income and wealth inequality today than we have ever had. You have 60 percent of our people living paycheck to paycheck. You have got a health care system which is broken and dysfunctional. And despite spending so much, we're the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people. How do you not talk about those issues?\n\nBASH: She talked about affordability.\n\nSANDERS: Well, but in a vague -- I don't want to rehash that campaign.\n\nSANDERS: But I think the clue to Democratic victories is to understand that you have got to stand unequivocally with the working class of this country. You need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working people. Is it a radical idea that we join every other major country on Earth and guarantee health care to all people? Is that a radical idea? You tell me how many people are talking about that. Is it a radical idea to say that we have got to raise the minimum wage to $17 an hour? Is it a radical idea to say that, in the midst of a competitive global economy, we need to make sure we have the best-educated work force, that all of our kids, regardless of income, should be able to get a higher education? These ideas exist all over the world. They don't exist in America. And they don't exist because of the power of the oligarchs economically and politically. All right, let's be clear. In my view, the current political system in the United States of America is broken and corrupt. Does anybody think that it makes any sense at all that Elon Musk can spend $270 million to elect Trump as president and then become the most important person in government? Billionaires should not be able to buy elections. And, by the way, that's not just a progressive perspective. Conservatives understand that too.\n\nBASH: What makes you so sure that the solution that you're offering, which is a more assertive federal government, is something that is going to fly in places where people have been voting in recent years Republican and have an inherent distrust of government?\n\nSANDERS: Well, they should -- and they should have a distrust, for a number of reasons. The government is too bureaucratic and not responsive. But -- and let me tell you what I'm sure you already know, is that, if you look at the polling -- and I asked the people here today. You heard me ask.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSANDERS: Anybody here think that the American health care system is vaguely effective?\n\nAUDIENCE: No!\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSANDERS: Nobody in America thinks it's working. We spend twice as much as other countries, 85 million uninsured or underinsured; 60,000 people die a year because they can't get to a doctor on time. Do you think that, in America, with all of our genius, all of our capabilities, we, spending so much money, cannot provide a high- quality system that guarantees health care to all people? And do you think people here don't know that? They know. They know we can do it. Throughout Europe and other countries, you don't have to leave college $50,000, $100,000 in debt, or a half-a-million in debt if you go to medical school. That makes zero sense. But, look, let's be clear on the message of tonight and what I will continue to give. You have a government today that is run by the wealthiest people in this country. They are extremely greedy people. They want it all. And we have got to stand up to them. Unfortunately, for many decades, that has not been the Democratic Party, and that has got to change.\n\nBASH: I'm sure you have heard about some Democrats who are talking about embracing the so-called abundance movement...\n\nSANDERS: Yes.\n\nBASH: ... the idea that liberal politicians have created too much regulatory red tape and it stops government from getting anything done. I spoke recently to Democratic Congressman Ritchie Torres, who said that Democrats shouldn't be the party of more government, but the party of better, cheaper and faster government. What do you make of that idea? \n\nSANDERS: Well, I think it is clear. Look, I deal with bureaucracy every day at the federal level, the state level, at the local level. It's absolutely true. To build a house, to do this, do that, you have to go through all kinds of things. To apply for Medicaid, you have got to fill out 87 forms. Dealing with your insurance companies, you have got to fill out a million forms. We live in a world which is much, much too complicated. So, if the goal is to make it sure that, within environmental safeguards, we can move forward much faster, the answer is yes. But that is not the fundamental problem facing America. The fundamental problem facing America is that you have got a handful of oligarchs who have enormous wealth, enormous economic power, enormous political power, and they want even more. That is the fundamental issue. Should we make government more efficient? Absolutely.\n\nBASH: Just a couple of political questions.\n\nPresident Trump suggested this week that the vice president, JD Vance, is probably the favorite to take over the so-called MAGA movement. He's from this kind of area. I mean, he's from Appalachia. He probably has appeal in red states and working-class areas. Do you think him being an heir to the MAGA movement is something that should be concerning to Democrats trying to defeat MAGA?\n\nSANDERS: Not my thing at all. I really don't know. I don't particularly care. I think he has nothing really -- neither Trump nor he, nor the Republicans of today have anything of significance to say to working-class people. What they're trying to do is to divide us up. Oh, you're a Muslim. You're undocumented. You're black. You're gay. Let's divide everybody up so that rich can become richer. Our job is to bring people together. Doesn't matter to me who heads the Republican Party.\n\nBASH: Redistricting.\n\nSANDERS: Yes.\n\nBASH: What's going on in Texas. Republicans are pushing to redraw the state's map to try to bolster the House GOP majority, eliminating Democratic seats. I know you have been a very -- a longtime opponent of gerrymandering with redistricting, but you also say the Democratic governors should -- quote -- \"fight fire with fire\" and redraw...\n\nSANDERS: Look, there are a couple of things here. \n\nSANDERS: What is quite incredible, I mean, see, we are taking Trumpism kind of as normal. Trump is the one who came up with the idea. He says, hmm, let's see. Texas, I think we can get five more seats. Do it. Oh, yes. Yes, sir. You're the great leader. We will do it. And they're off and trying to do it. So everybody knows what's going on. It is undemocratic. It is outrageous.\n\nBASH: And yet you think Democratic governors should try to push back and do the same thing?\n\nSANDERS: I think it's sad. I think they have no choice. I mean, what Trump is trying to do, he understands that there is a good chance that the Republicans will lose control over the House, I would hope the Senate as well. That will be a tougher fight. So he's trying to make -- in his authoritarian way, say, hey, I don't want to lose elections. Let's rig the system. Give me five more votes in Texas to me, maybe some other states. So what should Democrats do, sit back and say, oh, gee, Trump is doing this terrible -- we can't do anything, let them win the election, when they should? So Democrats have got to fight back. I think it's pathetic, but I think that's what they have got to do.\n\nBASH: Even though you have said that gerrymandering undermines the political process?\n\nSANDERS: It does. Of course it does.\n\nSANDERS: It's -- what we have now is a terrible situation, and Republicans are making it worse. But what do you do? If Republicans are doing it, you have to respond. It's pathetic, but I think you have to respond.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nBASH: Up next, much more of my interview with Senator Bernie Sanders, including Bernie 2028? Plus, the FBI is now getting involved as Texas Republicans escalate their redistricting fight. Our panel weighs in ahead.\n\nBASH: Welcome back to STATE OF THE UNION. As we enter a critical week on the foreign policy front for the White House, I asked Senator Bernie Sanders about President Trump's upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin, as well as what he thinks the future might hold for him and his movement.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nBASH: The president announced that Vladimir Putin is going to come to Alaska on August 15th and they're going to meet. First, what's your reaction to Vladimir Putin coming onto American soil for this meeting?\n\nSANDERS: Vladimir Putin is a really awful guy. When you talk about oligarchs, Putin is one of the richest guys in the world, running a kleptocratic society, and then he invaded Ukraine with incredible destruction. I mean, tens and tens and tens of thousands of Russian soldiers have been killed. People in Ukraine are suffering terribly because this guy wanted to start the most -- the largest war since World War II in Europe. So, I'm not a great fan of Vladimir Putin.\n\nBASH: What about the idea of this summit or meeting?\n\nSANDERS: Look, we -- I -- you know, it's -- the bloodshed and the suffering is terrible. If, in fact, an agreement can be negotiated which does not compromise what the Ukrainians feel that they need, I think that's a positive step forward. We all want to see an end to the bloodshed.\n\nBASH: Do you trust a Donald Trump-Vladimir Putin deal?\n\nSANDERS: Well, it's not -- it can't be Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. The people of Ukraine obviously have got to have a significant say. It is their country. So, if they feel, the people of Ukraine feel that the agreement is positive, that's good. If not, that's another story.\n\nBASH: Let's talk about Israel.\n\nSANDERS: Yes.\n\nBASH: Israel's Security Cabinet approved a plan to take control of Gaza City. Your response?\n\nSANDERS: Look, Israel had a right, of course, to defend itself from the terrible terrorist attack from Hamas, but what they have done since then is gone to war against the entire Palestinian people. There are now some 60,000 who are dead, most of whom are women, children, and the elderly. You have got 18,000 kids, kids who have been killed, 3,000 children who have had one or another limb amputated. And now, on top of all of the destruction, human destruction, incredible destruction of their housing, of their schools, of their universities, of their health care systems, on top of all that, what Netanyahu does is impose a blockade preventing food to come in, and people are starving to death. So I think the good news is that we are making some progress. I offered a resolution, as you know, a couple of weeks ago. We got 27 votes from Democrats to stop military weapons going to Gaza, no Republican support. But you know what I think? I think Republicans at the grassroots level are also catching on that it is not a great idea to provide billions to a government that starves children.\n\nBASH: Would you say Hamas has some culpability in people starving?\n\nSANDERS: No.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBASH: Why, when they spent so much money building tunnels and everything under...\n\nSANDERS: So, right now, right now, what is going on is a slaughter, all right? And right now, Israel is -- with few exceptions, is in control of the military situation. It is not Hamas. Hamas is a terrible terrorist organization, all right? And I certainly hope they have no future in a new Gaza or Palestine. But the fault right now is 100 percent on a Netanyahu government, who has waged an all-out war, committed just -- I mean, it is war crimes. They are war crimes. Netanyahu is a war criminal, just as the guy who is head of Hamas is a war criminal. And the United States taxpayers should not be funding Netanyahu.\n\nBASH: You have been critical of Benjamin Netanyahu for a very long time. But I want to ask you just about something that sometimes gets lost, especially right now, when this debate is so emotional and so raw, which is -- especially on the left -- which is, take Netanyahu out of this. Do you believe in the notion of Israel as a Jewish state?\n\nSANDERS: Yes, I do, for a lot of reasons. But, right now, what Netanyahu has done, what the Israeli government has done is become almost a pariah state. And I fear very much that Israel now is looked in very, very unfavorable light by people all over the world, all over the world, not just in the United States.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSANDERS: I was told that West Virginia was a conservative state. Somebody got it wrong.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBASH: Something that I'm sure you have seen, a Gallup poll. Did you see this Gallup poll?\n\nSANDERS: Yes.\n\nBASH: And what the Gallup poll found was that you are one of the most widely admired Americans. And I believe you're only second to the pope.\n\nSANDERS: You want me to declare my candidacy for pope? Is that what you're asking?\n\nBASH: I don't think -- I don't think that you're eligible, for a lot of reasons.\n\nSANDERS: All right. Then I won't do that.\n\nBASH: I watched you tonight. I have watched you for a very, very long time. You're obviously still full of vigor and intensity for the things that you're passionate about and have been for decades. Is there another presidential run in you?\n\nSANDERS: Oh, God. Let's not worry about that. I am going to be 84 years of age next month, as a matter of fact. So I think that speaks for itself. But, right now, what is more important, in my view -- and I want to see, obviously, the most progressive candidate that we can have -- is to rally the grassroots of America. A moment ago, you asked me about West Virginia and why people vote for Donald Trump. Our job is to turn that around. Our job is to educate and organize and give people, working-class people, an agenda which understands that, in the richest country in the history of the world, we can, in fact, provide a decent standard of living for all of our people.\n\nBASH: But, Senator, you know better than I that you could have a very hungry and energized base with an idea of what they want, but if they don't find leadership or find the person that can articulate that, it doesn't change.\n\nSANDERS: Well, you're asking a complicated issue. I think strong grassroots movements will bring forth the appropriate leadership. I think, when people give up on the political process, when you have a handful of billionaires deciding who will run, which is the case right now...\n\nBASH: Are there people out there who will -- that you feel comfortable and confident will take up the Bernie Sanders mantle and run in 2028?\n\nSANDERS: Well, that's not the Bernie Sanders -- will they stand up and fight for economic and social and racial justice?

JB Pritzker on Sunday ripped socialist New York City mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani’s contention that people of his net worth shouldn’t exist.\n\n“Look, how much money you have doesn’t determine what your values are,” Pritzker fired back on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\nMamdani had declared shortly after his shock Democratic primary win in June that he that he doesn’t want Americans to be allowed to amass billion-dollar fortunes.\n\n“I don’t think that we should have billionaires because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality, and ultimately, what we need more of is equality across our city and across our state and across our country,” he told “Meet the Press” at the time.\n\nBut Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, Sunday rattled off his beliefs in universal healthcare, free public education, democracy and opposition to “MAGA Republicans” as evidence that he is a legit Democrat.\n\n“It does not matter what your income level is. What matters is what your values are. And that’s what makes me a Democrat,” the ultra-wealthy pol contended.\n\nPritzker, who has led Illinois since 2019 and is one of the richest politicians in the country, has an estimated net worth of about $3.6 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nHis fortune stems almost entirely from his family’s wealth from its ownership of the Hyatt hotel chain, which was founded by his late uncle, Jay. Some of the gov’s wealth comes from other investments, such as the Pritzker Group.\n\nThe Pritzkers have been a fixture on Forbes’ “America’s Richest Families” for decades. \n\nThe Illinois Democrat has donated heavily to the party throughout the years and tapped into his deep pockets for his own runs, having spent an estimated $323 million on his two campaigns for governor.\n\nNow he’s gearing up to seek a third term — although he hasn’t ruled out a 2028 presidential run.\n\nMamdani’s campaign did not respond to a Post request for comment.\n\nAs with many top Democrats, Pritzker has refrained from backing Mamdani outright.\n\nThe governor has meanwhile made headlines for welcoming Texas Democrats to Illinois in a bid to disrupt GOP redistricting efforts in the Lone Star State. Pritzker shrugged off Republican attacks on him for being hypocritical, given that his state has one of the most heavily gerrymandered maps in the country.\n\n“What Texas is trying to do is, again, violate the Voting Rights Act. We didn’t,” Pritzker claimed. “We held public hearings, legislative hearings. People attended them. They spoke out. There was a map that was put out. There were actually changes made to the map.”\n\nDemocrats control 14 of Illinois’ 17 congressional seats — or 82%. Former Vice President Kamala Harris won the state in November with 54% of the vote.\n\nBy comparison, Republicans have 26 of the 38 congressional seats in Texas — or 68%. President Trump won Texas in November with 56% of the vote. Trump is hoping to squeeze another five seats out of Texas through the proposed mid-decade redistricting.\n\nTexas Democrats have held up the redistricting effort so far by fleeing the state to stop the state legislature from passing it.","summary":"Billionaire Illinois Gov.

As the Trump administration uses cruelty—and publicizes it—to push for self-deportation, Dr. Phil’s broadcasts are important.\n\nAs Isabela documented in January, the daytime host has gone along with ICE raids, in faux-documentary style reports, often parrotting government talking points without investigation. “This truly is a targeted ICE mission,” McGraw tells viewers, “they’re not sweeping neighborhoods like people are trying to imply.” The truth? That day, ICE arrested 1,179 people nationwide, according to NBC News, just half of whom were deemed “criminal arrests.”\n\nA month before the raid, McGraw reportedly brokered a friendly meeting between Homan and New York City Mayor Eric Adams, after which Adams announced he would alter sanctuary city laws; this allowed local law enforcement to work more closely with the federal government on immigration enforcement.\n\nAnd as my colleague Mark Follman has written, McGraw also lent credence to Trump’s baseless claims that former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris somehow benefited from his attempted assassination in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year. (“I’m not saying they wanted you to get shot,” McGraw said in that interview, “but do you think it was OK with them if you did?”) More recently, McGraw appeared alongside Trump in Texas, in the wake of last month’s tragic floods that killed more than 130 people, including more than two dozen kids and counselors at a summer camp; Trump also appointed McGraw to a (so-called) Religious Liberty Commission.\n\nDespite all this, McGraw refused to tell the Times whether or not he voted for the current president. (“When people ask me about that, I ask them if they’ve listened to what I said,” he said. “Did you?”) McGraw also claimed that, despite his appearance at last fall’s Trump rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City, he would have appeared at a rally with Harris, the Democratic nominee, but that her team stopped following up with him in the midst of discussions. (Harris’s spokespeople told the newspaper they were not aware of any such conversations.)\n\nThe main thing that the host’s non-answers shine a light on is how sensitive he seems to be to criticism about his support for Trump’s policies.\n\nThis past week, when Bill Maher confronted McGraw about why he joined ICE raids, he claimed that it was “bullshit” that he, or ICE, were responsible for “separating families.” \n\nBut the Trump administration has continued to separate families. \n\nAnd as Alida Garcia, an organizer and former immigration official under Biden, told the Times: “When you are riding along with the government, they are putting you on a publicity tour.

JB Pritzker, on 'Meet the Press,' says he won't rule out '28 presidential run","text":"Gov. JB Pritzker on Sunday’s “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” said he’s not ruling out a 2028 presidential run — and called President Donald Trump a “cheater” in his personal and professional life.\n\nThe Democratic governor also once again defended Illinois’ Democratic-led congressional maps as he remains in the national spotlight for helping Texas Democrats take refuge in Illinois to avoid Republican redistricting efforts in their state.\n\nPritzker, who was on Kamala Harris’ vice presidential shortlist, has been asked about his political future for years — and he’s always vowed that Illinois was his first priority. But pressed by Welker on whether he can completely rule out a presidential run, the governor offered up a small glimpse.\n\n“I can’t rule anything out, but what I can rule in is that no matter what decisions I make, and I mean in particular about what I do here in the state of Illinois, is about the people of Illinois,” Pritzker said, according to an NBC transcript of Pritzker’s pre-recorded interview. “Indeed, any future decisions of mine will always be guided by that.”\n\nThe governor was asked if it was hypocritical for him to criticize Texas’ redistricting plan as Illinois has 14 Democratic districts out of 17 congressional districts in a state that saw 44% support for Trump in the 2024 election. \n\n“Well, remember that what Texas is trying to do is, again, violate the Voting Rights Act. We didn’t. We held public hearings, legislative hearings. People attended them. They spoke out. There was a map that was put out. There were actually changes made to the map. And a map was passed, and it was done at the end of the census, the decennial census. So that’s how it’s done in this country,” Pritzker said.\n\nThe governor pointed the finger at Trump, saying Texas Democrats are changing the rules mid-decade “at the behest of the president of the United States, who’s clearly attempting to and says that he deserves to have five more seats.”\n\n“... He knows he’s going to lose the Congress in 2026. That’s why he’s going to his allies and hoping that they can save him. And we’ve all got to stand up against this,” Pritzker said. “This is — it’s cheating. Donald Trump is a cheater. He cheats on his wives. He cheats at golf. And now he’s trying to cheat the American people out of their votes.” \n\nWelker asked Pritzker, whose worth is estimated at $3.7 billion by Forbes, about Democratic nominee for New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani’s comments that billionaires shouldn’t exist.\n\n“Governor, is that the kind of message that Democrats should be embracing?” Welker asked.\n\n“Look — how much money you have doesn’t determine what your values are. And I’m a Democrat because I believe that everyone deserves healthcare. I’m a Democrat because I believe we’ve got to fund education and have a free public education available to every kid in this country,” Pritzker said. “I’m a Democrat because I believe that we’ve got to stand up for our democracy and against the MAGA Republicans who are literally trying to take away people’s rights all across this country. So it does not matter what your income level is. What matters is what your values are, and that’s what makes me a Democrat.”\n\nThe Democratic governor took a different approach on Tuesday’s “Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” instead making light of his wealth and trading barbs about Illinois’ congressional maps. Pritzker told Colbert he was “OK” with being a billionaire when Colbert offered that being a billionaire is “not a very popular thing to be right now.”\n\n“You’re OK with it, I’m sure,” Colbert said. “You know what? That shows real courage.”\n\n“I’ve got to stand up for my people,” Pritzker said to laughs.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/illinois-governor/2025/08/10/gov-jb-pritzker-meet-the-press-2028-election","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/605ed62/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5187x3458+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F39%2F63%2F02f7ba894cf4a5e200e6a3f098e8%2Felect","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 13:00:00","author":"Tina Sfondeles","authors":["Tina Sfondeles"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.095},{"id":349834080,"title":"Latest line: A good week for Katie Porter, a bad week for Eleni Kounalakis","text":"Katie Porter\n\nDemocratic former Orange County congresswoman appears to be the biggest beneficiary in the 2026 governor’s race after Kamala Harris opts out, as a new poll now shows her in the lead and her fundraising grows.\n\nEleni Kounalakis\n\nStuck at 3% in polls, low-profile Democratic lieutenant governor, part of a wealthy Sacramento developer family, drops out of 2026 governor’s race, and announces she will run for state treasurer instead.\n\nRick Caruso\n\nLos Angeles billionaire who lost 2022 L.A. mayor’s race may have an opportunity in the governor’s race with Harris and Kounalakis out.

What divides opinion is the margin of victory. There are three viewpoints on the numbers. One – there will be a tight race, but the PPP will go beyond its one-seat majority. Secondly, there is the widespread belief that the PPP will pick up many more seats than its present configuration.\nThe third position of some people, but particularly those in PPP circles, is that a two-thirds majority is possible. The contention of this article is that the largeness of the PPP’ votes will be decided by the Irfaan Ali variable. A myriad of factors explain an election victory.\nFirst, there is the terrible sight of a non-performing government. Two examples should suffice. The Rishi Sunak regime in the UK was simply in tatters. The British people lost respect and hope in the Conservative Government. The Labour Party victory was the result of an atrocious incumbent and nothing else.\nIn Trinidad, the Rowley Government had reached the point of no return. Whoever headed the opposition would have won, so no credit should be given to Kamla Bissessar. She is not an exciting politician. Secondly, an incumbent can lose if the president and prime minister have to find a successor and the successor is a terrible, lacklustre choice. The stupidity of selecting Kamala Harris will become a permanent blot on the face of the American Democratic Party.\nThirdly, an election victory can be secured through the dialectical role of the powerful, penetrating, charismatic, and enigmatic individual. The American electorate voted not for the Republican Party candidate but for the man, Trump himself. It is possible if the Republicans had their own candidate and Trump ran as an independent. He still would have won. Trump’s victory has to be put down to the concept known as the role of the individual in history. In Barbados, it was impossible for Mia Mottley not to be re-elected. Her personality was the decisive factor.\nWe come now to Irfaan Ali. The PPP will achieve victory in September because an oil economy has changed the face of Guyana. It is basic political theory that will continue to exist that if a government has the resources to develop a country, voters will be grateful.\nIt is an absolutely twisted mind that can look at the transformation of Guyana over the past five years and deny it. The debate will go on forever that the PPP became accepted and popular because it had national wealth to effect a deep transformation of the totality of Guyana. How can one fault a ruling party for becoming popular and reassured of electoral victory if the economy allowed it to spread the national wealth? That is the reality of the world of politics.\nThe PPP’s achievements and accomplishments (there are subtle differences in the two words) are impressive. It is hard for the decent, nationalistic mind to reject that reality. This reality will cause it to become the next government. I contend that although it will secure a majority vote, the personality of Irfaan Ali will allow the PPP to go far beyond its one-seat majority.\nMy deeply held belief is that a two-thirds majority is out of reach because the PPP will need ten more seats. However, I am prepared to say that it is a possibility due to the role Irfaan Ali will play, as Trump and Mottley did. I am convinced that the PPP will receive multi-racial votes and votes across demographic fences and ballots that cut across class and gender, and this will be due to the personality of Ali.\nPeople are fascinated by the emergence of Ali and what he has become. One reason is that the present generation in this country has not seen a leader in another country who had an inviting style like Dr. Mohamed Irfaan Ali. Ali is well-liked throughout Guyana, and one of the sustaining factors in this psychological process is that people believe he is a good man who means well for Guyana.\nI think the perception of Ali is penetratingly positive in this country, and out of this frame of mind, people want to see him rule for a second term. From the time Ali became a different leader from what the Caribbean produced before, I have argued that he stands a huge chance of eclipsing all previous Caribbean leaders. Guyanese are going to hand the PPP its biggest majority in the history of electoral competition in Guyana, and that will be solely because of the role of the individual in history. In Guyana’s case, that dialectical role will be played by Mohamed Irfaan Ali.\nDISCLAIMER: The views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the Guyana National Newspapers Limited.","summary":"THE rising consensus in Guyana at the moment is that the PPP will be re-elected.

Smith gives clearest sign yet he might run for president and takes shot at Democrat 'frontrunner'","text":"Stephen A. Smith has given the clearest indication to date that he's 'open' to running for president as he took an early shot at a potential rival in the 2028 Democratic primary. \n\nThe sports broadcaster said he will 'leave the door open' to a presidential bid during a Friday appearance on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher.\n\n'I can't imagine myself doing it, but I haven't ruled it out because I'm disgusted with what I'm seeing on the left,' he said.\n\nSmith also said there's nobody on the Democratic side he thinks is capable of taking the mantle.\n\n'I look at the national voices for the Democratic party, it is nonexistent. As far as I'm concerned, a damn construction worker could win the Democratic nomination right now,' Smith said to shocked audience. \n\n'They are in for an a** kicking if they don't get their act together. The party is in disarray. No leadership.'\n\nMaher, a liberal who's a frequent critic of Democrats, agreed with Smith's assessment of the party and hyped up the idea of him running. \n\n'This is what they need, they need somebody who has nothing to lose who's like you know what, you like what I say, great. If you don't, I'll go back to ESPN,' Maher said.\n\nLater in the show, Smith also took aim at Pete Buttigieg, who consistently has been polling near the top of the field with likely Democratic primary voters.\n\nHowever, as Maher pointed out, there is one serious shortcoming the former transportation secretary has yet to address.\n\nMaher referenced an Emerson College poll from late June where Buttigieg led the field with 16 percent, but registered zero percent support from black voters. \n\n'You don't usually see zero anywhere. Zero's low,' Maher said. 'What is that all about?'\n\nSmith responded with a devastating, 'He doesn't move us,' before pausing dramatically for effect.\n\n'I respect the man. I've interviewed him before, very nice man, highly intelligent. But you gotta be able to move us, bro. He doesn't move us. You can speculate as to why that is, I'm not going there. He doesn't move us,' he added.\n\nBlack voters are an especially important constituency in Democratic primaries and often decide the eventual outcome.\n\nBlack people overwhelmingly backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020, according to exit polls. Both went on to become the nominee for president.\n\nBernie Sanders, the main rival for Clinton and Biden in those elections, had anemic support with that demographic by comparison.\n\nIn the poll that showed Buttigieg on top, former Vice President Kamala Harris and California Governor Gavin Newsom were nipping at his heels at 13 percent and 12 percent, respectively. \n\nThe 2028 primary is shaping up to be one with many candidates, since even former President Barack Obama has publicly griped that there is no defined leader of the party.\n\nWith Kamala Harris opting not to run for governor in California, many have seen that as a decision to free her up for another shot at the White House. \n\nHarris leads most polls she is included in, with Buttigieg and Newsom consistently coming in second or third place behind her.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is another contender that's being discussed among pundits, however, there is a chance she'll try to unseat Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who's up for re-election in 2028.\n\nA series of polls have come out showing she'd beat the New York senator by double digits.\n\nAlthough it's early in the process, Newsom, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Buttigieg and AOC have all visited early primary states, which is typically a signal that they are at least strongly considering a run.\n\nOther players to watch include Maryland Governor Wes Moore, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.","summary":"The sports broadcaster left the door open for a 2028 presidential run in an appearance opposite Bill Maher on Friday, as he took an early shot at a potential rival in the 2028 Democratic primaries.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14986565/stephen-smith-run-president-Bill-Maher-democrat.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/10/03/101076115-0-image-m-58_1754792686485.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 02:50:06","author":"Editor,James Cirrone","authors":["Editor","James Cirrone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":349709422,"title":"Inside the enormous Biden effort to ‘debank’ Trump after Jan. 6","text":"The scale of the effort to “debank” Donald Trump because of pressure from Biden administration regulators went far beyond JPMorgan and Bank of America, The Post has learned.\n\nAt least 10 other financial institutions closed their windows to the billionaire real estate tycoon over his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol Hill -melee. \n\nThe moves came in the months after Trump left the White House in 2021, sources inside the Trump Organization told me.\n\nThe stunning scale of the blacklisting is being revealed here for the first time. \n\nIt should be reported as much as possible for the simple reason that if any big bank can cancel a former president over politics as opposed to illegality, then every American citizen is in danger of facing the same mistreatment.\n\nFor expressing an opinion, or starting a business out of step with the progressive culture norms that have infected so much of society, you too can see your economic livelihood go up in smoke and -“debanked.”\n\nDebanking is such an odd word for one of the most insidious parts of cancel culture, and its sponsors like it that way.\n\nIt sanitizes, via clumsy, obtuse lingo, what is essentially something of dangerous -Orwellian magnitude: negating an American citizen’s ability to save, and conduct business through a big bank.\n\nThat’s why Trump and Republicans like South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott are taking steps to end the politicization of banking. \n\nKeep in mind, there are already laws preventing the likes of JPMorgan, BofA and Capital One — the banks Trump has publicly stated canceled him — from being conduits for drug kingpins and Mafiosi.\n\n(Trump has sued Capital One, which denied Trump’s allegations.)\n\nDebanking takes it further. It forces banks to remove customers who might pose nothing more than “reputational risk,” a flighty rule enforced by bank regulators in recent years to keep financial institutions from doing business with people like Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe now-deceased convicted child sex predator was a JPMorgan customer for years, and in theory making it impossible for Epstein to finance his illegality sounds like what should be happening.\n\nThat is until you dig deeper.\n\nUnder pressure from the Biden administration, just after Trump lost the 2020 election and started to act out (which the last time I checked was his constitutional right), the enforcement of reputational risk took a decidedly political turn, bank officials tell me.\n\nIf you believe people at the two largest banks, Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan and Brian Moynihan’s BofA, the Biden administration -unleashed its bank regulatory cops at the Office of Comptroller of Currency, the FDIC and the semi-independent Federal Reserve to go beyond nixing perverted financiers from their platform.\n\nThey used the amorphous nature of what is reputational risk to enforce a political regime, the bank -officials said.\n\nThe Bidenistas hated crypto, thought it was an affront to their power to control the economy, and pressured banks from doing business with this somewhat heterodox emerging industry, according to the bank sources.\n\nSo was anything related to guns and certain conservative religious organizations, they added. \n\nAnd most of all, anything MAGA, including the multibillion-dollar real estate and resort empire of Mr. MAGA himself, Donald J. Trump.\n\nSuch an effort isn’t easy to prove because there’s no direct smoking gun, no memo (at least not yet) telling banks to cancel Trump from their system. \n\nThe banks say the pressure was more subtle but still real: Failure to remove Trump or crypto types and others would result in heightened enforcement, -harassment and possibly fines.\n\nThe banks decided to drop customers, even rich ones like Trump, because it wasn’t worth the hassle.\n\nI have covered finance for three decades now and thought I saw it all: Bernie Madoff, Epstein, the 2008 financial crisis, Wall Street scandals, penny stock scams and hedge fund implosions.\n\nBut what happened to Trump in 2021 was truly surprising given the breadth of big banks dropping him as a client and scary given their rationale. \n\nAs bad as the events of Jan. 6 were, Trump did tell the crowd that crazy afternoon to protest peacefully.\n\nTrump didn’t break the law holding a rally. \n\nYou may disagree with his rhetoric that day.\n\nHe had just lost a closely fought election against Joe Biden. \n\nTrump said he really won it. \n\nMillions of people seemed to agree.\n\nHe wouldn’t be the first politician to pull that lever. Democrat Stacey Abrams never really fully conceded when she lost in her first attempt to become governor of Georgia against Republican Brian Kemp. \n\nHow many times did Hillary Clinton say Trump was an “illegitimate president” after she lost the 2016 contest to him? \n\nDuring the violent social justice protests of 2020, Gwen Walz, the wife of Minnesota Gov. and 2024 Democrat VP candidate Tim Walz, said she “kept the windows” open to smell the burning debris.\n\n“I felt like that was such a touchstone of what was happening,” she said.\n\nOr how about what Kamala Harris proudly said around the same time. \n\nThe then-Biden VP candidate, who went on to get trounced by Trump in 2024, supported the defunding of the police movement that led to much more mayhem than what -occurred on Jan. 6.\n\nHer rationale for the “largely peaceful protests” that burned cities to the ground, delivered to fellow-traveler lefty late-night host Stephen Colbert, is at least as cringey as anything Trump said on Jan. 6.\n\n“They’re not going to stop,” she said during an appearance on the show. \n\n“They’re not. This is a movement. I’m telling you. They’re not going to stop, and everyone, beware . . . That they’re not going to let up. And they should not, and we should not.”\n\nDid Jamie Dimon tell Harris that her money isn’t good at JPM?","summary":"The scale of the effort to “debank” Donald Trump because of pressure from Biden administration regulators went far beyond JPMorgan and Bank of America, The Post has learned.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/09/business/gasparino-inside-the-enormous-biden-effort-to-debank-trump-after-jan-6/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/newspress-collage-7xzmb6tfq-1754785486519.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1754771181&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/4QSmeyMi-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-10 01:30:18","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.411}]}
