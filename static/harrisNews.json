But I did warn y'all,” he added.\n\nThe former president began by reeling off how the Trump family has benefited from cryptocurrency dealings and accused the president of prioritizing his “billionaire pals and finance bros.”\n\n“Is the economy working better for you? Because it sure has gotten better for Trump and his family,” said Obama. \n\nMembers of the Trump family, through an umbrella company, own more than half of the cryptocurrency venture World Liberty Financial and it has allegedly netted them hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Reuters.\n\n“Since he's been in office, the whole crypto business and other ventures have made hundreds of millions of dollars,” Obama continued. “Including from foreign nationals and rich folks investing because they want to stay in the President's good graces.”\n\nThe Independent has contacted the White House for comment.\n\nObama then criticized Trump for his $300 million ballroom and paving over the White House Rose Garden, which now resembles his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach.\n\n“He has been focused on critical issues like paving over the Rose Garden so folks don't get mud on their shoes, and gold plating the Oval Office and building a $300 million ballroom,” Obama said.\n\nThe Democrat then took aim at the artificial intelligence videos Trump often posts on his Truth Social account, including one showing himself wearing a crown, flying a “KING TRUMP” fighter jet, and bombing a crowd of No Kings protesters with brown liquid.\n\n“And all the nonsense we see on the news every day, the over the top rhetoric, the fabricated conspiracies, the weird videos of a U.S. president with a crown on his head flying a fighter jet and dumping poop on protesting citizens,” said Obama.\n\nThe video, according to Obama, is part of the Trump administration’s attempt to “distract” voters.\n\n“They do it so you won't notice that while they're helping the wealthiest, most powerful people in the country consolidate more wealth and more power, your bills are still going up,” he said.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, spent his Halloween in Palm Beach where his Mar-a-Lago residence was throwing a Great Gatsby-themed bash.\n\nHe was criticized for attending the lavish event hours before a vital food assistance program relied upon by millions of Americans was about to lapse.\n\nObama was speaking a few days on from a reported revelation that he wanted to let a “process” determine the Democratic nominee after former President Joe Biden dropped out of the running in 2024, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl wrote in his new book Retribution.\n\nHe was “not happy” with Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s speedy endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris – and chewed the former House speaker out in an angry phone call, according to the book.","summary":"Obama laid into Trump during a speech in support of Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/obama-speech-trump-halloween-b2856773.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/01/19/05/Former-President-Obama-Campaigns-With-New-Jersey-And-Virginia-Democratic-Gubernatorial-Candidates-Ah.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HPM3EOjv-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-01 22:00:43","author":"Rhian Lubin","authors":["Rhian Lubin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.145},{"id":374851114,"title":"NJ Dem chair admits ‘New Jersey is a battleground state’ while stumping with Sherrill","text":"CLIFTON, NJ — New Jersey Democratic Party Chairman LeRoy Jones, Jr. openly admitted that the Garden State is a “battleground state” now, while stumping with Rep. Mikie Sherrill, as polls show her in a dead heat with Republican Jack Ciattarelli.\n\n“Thank you so much for joining us here in New Jersey, the epicenter of our democracy, because this is a battleground state,” he proclaimed, kicking off a speech that centered largely on national politics rather than state issues. \n\n“Let me tell you this, New Jersey is a battleground state this time because we are fighting for our future, we are fighting for affordability, we are fighting for democracy,” Jones further warned the crowd.\n\nJones and Sherrill had been rallying in Clifton, NJ, part of Passaic County, which President Trump dramatically flipped red last November — a fact that was not lost on the speakers in the room.\n\nSherrill and Jones were flanked by a coterie of Democratic stars such as Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) as well as Rep. Nellie Pou (D-NJ) and several local Democrats.\n\nIronically, when it was Sherrill’s turn during their rally at a packed room in Elks Lodge, the congresswoman later contradicted him, insisting that “New Jersey is a blue state.”\n\n“Here’s the thing, New Jersey is not a red state,” Sherrill told the crowd shortly after Jones’ stunning admission. “New Jersey is not a purple state. In this instance, New Jersey is a blue state.”\n\nDuring her roughly 11-minute stump speech, Sherrill made no direct mention of Ciattarelli by name and trained much of her fire on Trump. \n\nJones, who has led the state Democratic Party since 2021, caused a stir earlier this year when he warned party officials Democratic National Committee conference call about their messaging shortfalls with black voters.\n\n“As a black man, not just as a black chair, we have to do better,” Jones warned on the call, the Associated Press reported.\n\nNew Jersey has surprised observers over recent election cycles, where Republicans were far more competitive than they were expected to be. \n\nFour years ago, Ciattarelli came within about 3 percentage points of beating then-incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy (D), significantly overperforming most polling. \n\nLast November, Trump lost New Jersey to former Vice President Kamala Harris by about 6 percentage points, a much closer gap than the 16-point loss he had in the Garden State in 2020. \n\nPassaic County, where Sherrill and Jones campaigned earlier in the day Saturday, was a particular source of heartburn.\n\nTrump had a roughly 22-point loss in Passaic County in 2016, followed by a 16-point defeat there in 2020, before flipping it by less than a percentage point in 2024. \n\nSherrill currently has a 3.3 percentage point polling edge over Ciattarelli, according to the latest RealClearPolitics polling aggregate.","summary":"New Jersey Democratic Party Chairman LeRoy Jones, Jr. openly admitted that the Garden State is a “battleground state” now, while stumping with Rep.

The candidate is running on policies such as freezing rent for tenants in rent-stabilized units, creating city-owned grocery stores, raising the minimum wage and offering fare-free buses in the city. Mamdani has told of the inspiration he has drawn from figures like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Bernie Sanders in developing his policies. Many Democrats have either spoken out against Mamdani or been unwilling to express support for his campaign, with some fearing his image could be detrimental to the Democrats’ push in the 2026 midterm congressional elections. Last month, the Republican campaign arm in the House of Representatives issued a memo vowing to oppose Mamdani and pit him as a symbol of the Democratic Party. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer refused to comment when asked if he would vote for Mamdani, while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries only endorsed him last week. A Forbes analysis showed that 26 billionaires and members of billion-dollar families from around the country have sunk at least $100,000 each into supporting Cuomo or one of the other candidates running against Mamdani. President Donald Trump has openly criticised Mamdani, calling him a “100% Communist Lunatic.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\nForbesHere Are The Two Billionaires Supporting Zohran MamdaniBy Kyle Khan-Mullins\n\nForbesAnyone But Mamdani: These Billionaires Are Spending Big To Stop Him From Becoming NYC’s MayorBy Kyle Khan-MullinsForbesLike Trump, Mamdani Appeals To Working People, Union Leader SaysBy Ted Reed\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"The former U.S. president stopped short of formally endorsing the Democratic candidate for New York City mayor.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kirkogunrinde/2025/11/01/obama-offers-to-be-zohran-mamdanis-sounding-board-if-he-wins-nyc-mayoral-election-report-says/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/69067325b68f1d468fe83320/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1689,950,x0,y52,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 20:53:07","author":"Former Contributor,Kirk Ogunrinde,Ryan Collerd","authors":["Former Contributor","Kirk Ogunrinde","Ryan Collerd"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.095},{"id":374843790,"title":"Former Trump official warns Mamdani victory would mark ‘Marxist shift’ for New York City","text":"America's most populous — and possibly most iconic — city is days away from possibly electing a self-defined socialist as its mayor. A former Trump administration official told Fox News Digital that a win for Zohran Mamdani could mark a shift towards Marxism in New York City. \"I could never fathom the thought of having a Marxist leading my city, the crown jewel city of the United States, of the world, of the free world,\" Gene Hamilton, America First Legal co-founder and president, told Fox News Digital. The heated New York City mayoral race has garnered national attention as former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, now running as an independent, Mamdani and Republican Curtis Sliwa face off in an all-out battle to govern the city. Hamilton, who formerly served as White House Deputy Counsel, noted some polls have shown a divide between U.S.- and foreign-born voters, with those coming from outside the country leaning more towards the young socialist. Hamilton said he sees this as evidence of long-failed immigration policies, as well as a shift away from promoting assimilation and towards pushing integration. NEW JERSEY DEMS SNUB ENDORSING SOCIALIST CANDIDATE MAMDANI AS GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION LOOMS \"One of the things we've seen over the last several decades is an emphasis amongst many social organizations, nonprofits, the government itself, on this concept of pushing integration, and not assimilation. 'Assimilation' was treated as a dirty word,\" Hamilton said, highlighting resistance against pushing for immigrants to adopt American culture. He said the difference is that integration now means that \"we're integrating you from whatever background you have, whatever political ideology you have, and we're just integrating you into society and everyone else has to deal with it.\" While Hamilton acknowledges that immigration can create appreciation for cultures, he asserted that this does not mean that those coming to the U.S. can ignore the existing culture they're moving into. He also emphasized the importance of upholding existing immigration laws, arguing that enforcement is not just about border control but about protecting American values. \"There are prohibitions, there are restrictions from the admission of individuals for many, many reasons,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"You can't admit somebody to the United States who's been a member of a totalitarian party or communist party. There are people that you can't submit because they're going to engage in certain types of activity.\" ZOHRAN MAMDANI LAUNCHES ANTI-TRUMP TOUR ACROSS FIVE BOROUGHS IN NEW YORK CITY \"There is an oath that every naturalized citizen has to take as part of becoming a citizen. They are promising to the United States government that they are renouncing any existing foreign ties and obligations, and instead they're embracing this new American identity. And so all of this wraps together to this devaluation of the value of an American, the American identity, the quintessential American identity that dominated perceptions across the world for decades and decades,\" Hamilton added. When it comes to the contentious New York City race, Hamilton said that it shows that the U.S. has brought in \"a lot of people\" and has failed to teach the importance of Western values, of the U.S. Constitution and what the founders fought for. He said he believes the sacrifices of those who built the country are being \"shunted aside towards this belief, this ideological suicide in some ways, that we can just bring anyone from anywhere across the world.\" He said the belief that as long as immigrants \"provide some kind of economic enhancement to the country of any kind — whether that's as an Uber driver, or whether it's as a nuclear scientist — that we should just welcome it all the same, treat them all the same, and we're all greatly enriched because of it just\" defies \"common sense.\" During last year's presidential election, immigration took center stage as many saw the Biden administration's handling of the border as a failure. This heavily impacted then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who was, at one point, tapped to be the country's border czar. MAMDANI TAKES COMMANDING 22-POINT LEAD OVER CUOMO IN NEW POLL Hamilton reflected on how the American people \"outright rejected the open borders mentality of the Biden administration,\" adding that it went beyond the rejection of open land borders and also the bringing in of people from all across the world. \"Things take time. It takes years for things to change, but we are now dealing with the consequences of years of failure up until now. We have a real chance to fix it now. Donald Trump is fixing things on the national level. The people of New York still have a chance to make this right. But things are looking really bad,\" Hamilton said. Hamilton also touched on the mentality New York Republicans should have while heading to the polls. Despite there being a Republican candidate in the race, there are those who believe that voting for Cuomo would hurt Mamdani, while voting for Sliwa would help him. NYC OFFICIAL EXPOSES MAMDANI'S 'MARXIST PLAYBOOK' IN REVEALING NEW FOX NATION SPECIAL \"I think it's really hard,\" Hamilton said. \"Ultimately, I know a lot of people like Sliwa. He seems like a wonderful man. I don't know him personally. And so you can stand proud and support on principle voting for a Republican. But at the end of the day, you also have to accept and recognize reality sometimes. And whatever it takes to ensure that you do get a Marxist in office is a reasonable decision to make, and so if that means holding your nose and voting for Cuomo, that's a personal decision to make.\" Even with the national election long over and the 2025 races just days away, there are those who are thinking about next year's midterms and how a Mamdani win could shift the tides. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP \"Certainly I think you'll see the Democratic Party rally around him and the energy behind his election as a means to try to turn out the vote in 2026 for their preferred candidates, to get this kind of more Marxist message out there and accepted,\" Hamilton said, adding that the possibly disastrous consequences of Mamdani's policies may not be evident immediately. \"It might take time to see the consequences of his disastrous policies. New York might not get trashed overnight,\" he added.","summary":"New York City mayoral race heats up as Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani sparks a national debate over American values and immigration.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-trump-official-warns-mamdani-victory-would-mark-marxist-shift-new-york-city","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/mamdani-bodega.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 20:45:39","author":"Rachel Wolf","authors":["Rachel Wolf"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.211},{"id":374849294,"title":"Poetry Corner with Kwesi BISSUE: The Francophone Diaries ","text":"Entertainment\n\nForeign News\n\nEbo Safo TV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday, November 1, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhana Latest News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\nForeign News\n\nEbo Safo TV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomeBusinessPoetry Corner with Kwesi BISSUE: The Francophone Diaries \n\n\n\nPoetry Corner with Kwesi BISSUE: The Francophone Diaries \n\n\n\nBy Ghana News\n -November 1, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake this and give me that\n\nIt is because you asked to be free\n\nTo be liberated from centuries of slavery\n\nIt is my tit for your tat\n\nGive me all there is\n\nAnd take this little piece\n\nIt is because I granted you just enough space\n\nFreed you from my tight grips\n\nFor half a breathing space\n\nJe suis Presidente Sarkozy\n\nIt is because you rejected to breathe under my direct control\n\nIt is because I opted to rule via remote control\n\nBut still in the control mode\n\nStill in the control room\n\nJe suis General De Gaule\n\n*Mercredi;*\n\nIf you need to take it from your own\n\nYou can have it as a loan\n\nIt is because I did not give you up\n\nIt is because I still own your land\n\nI did not free you from my hand\n\nJe suis Monsieur Mitterrandi\n\nI still hold on to them\n\nThe triumvirate\n\nLe Petit Gnassingbe\n\nHis Exuberance in France\n\nHassane Al Ouatarra\n\nHis Endurance with France\n\nPaul de Apostle Biya\n\nHis Resilience for France\n\nJe suis Emmanuel Macroni\n\nMon frere, never again\n\nJe suis Rèvolutionnaires Burkinabe\n\nAvec Mali et Guinea et Niger\n\nIt is because my testicles ache\n\nFrom aches of colonial trampling\n\nFrom cracks from Francophone thumping\n\nNothing in Faso lasts forever\n\nSankara et al\n\nIt’s time for Wagner\n\nJe suis Field Marshall Putin Vladimir\n\n*Vendredi;*\n\nAnd the ripples just began\n\nThey shifted the pension age\n\nTo a new age\n\nThose protesting French feet\n\nI care less to give a hoot\n\nThat’s the game of boot for boot\n\nJe suis President Macron\n\nThe free lunch is over\n\nKeep working until your ankles\n\nAnd your knuckles\n\n*Dimanche;*\n\nThe fool just brightened up\n\nStraightened up\n\nAt the long long last\n\nAnd it’s game over\n\n\n\n Post Views: 41\n\nDiscover more from The Business & Financial Times\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nSource link \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious articleKrachi West MCE commissions new clinic at Dadekro\n\nNext articleThe Presidency Commemorates Breast Cancer Awareness Month\nGhana News \n\nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMfantsipim thrashes Adisadel, Prempeh to qualify for NSMQ 2025 semi-finals \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt sucks when you call football soccer: Time to realign with the rest of the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLands Minister tables LI in Parliament to revoke controversial mining law LI 2462\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19,579FansLike\n\n1,785FollowersFollow\n\n0SubscribersSubscribe\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMOST READ NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHasaacas’s Ladies touch down in Bouake ahead of WAFU Zone B Women’s Champions League\n\nGhana News -

Donald Trump’s travel ban","text":"Donald Trump has reportedly proposed a travel ban on countries, which could impact nations set to compete in the 2026 FIFA World CupWith the tournament being co-hosted by the United States, Mexico, and Canada, restrictions could create complications for affected teamsFIFA may need to consider alternative solutions to ensure all qualified nations can participate without travel issues\n\nOne country may be barred from participating in the 2026 World Cup in the United States due to its inclusion on President Donald Trump’s proposed travel ban list. \n\nTrump, who returned to office as the 47th US President in January after defeating Kamala Harris in the election, has prioritised immigration policies, including suspending entry for undocumented immigrants. \n\nAccording to the New York Times, his administration has drafted a list of 43 countries facing various levels of travel restrictions, with the majority being African nations.\n\nThe list reportedly categorises countries into full visa bans, partial or strict visa suspensions, and nations given 60 days to address concerns before facing potential restrictions. \n\nMany of the fully banned nations have already been eliminated from World Cup qualifying, such as Afghanistan and North Korea. \n\nCountry could be blocked from playing at 2026 World Cup\n\nHowever, Iran, which recently secured qualification, is among the nations listed, potentially complicating their participation in the tournament.\n\nThe Asian country secured their spot in the 2026 World Cup after Mehdi Taremi netted twice in a 2-2 draw against Uzbekistan on Tuesday, 25th March, per ESPN.\n\nThe Inter Milan striker netted his second goal in the 83rd minute in Tehran, securing the crucial point Iran needed to qualify for their fourth consecutive World Cup and seventh overall.\n\nSeveral African nations still in World Cup contention—such as Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Burkina Faso—fall under the partial ban category. \n\nIn South America, Venezuela is the only country facing a full visa ban, potentially impacting their qualification hopes if they advance.\n\nOther countries facing full visa bans are Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen\n\nWhat could FIFA do next?\n\nThe 2026 World Cup is not solely being hosted by the United States, as Mexico and Canada are also set to stage several matches. \n\nThis opens the possibility of a resolution that would allow nations affected by travel restrictions, such as Iran, to play their group-stage matches and beyond in either Mexico or Canada. \n\nHowever, there has been no official indication that FIFA is considering such an arrangement.\n\nThe 2025 Champions Trophy cricket tournament offers a potential precedent for FIFA. \n\nDue to political tensions, India refused to play in host nation Pakistan, and the ICC allowed them to play their matches in Dubai instead. \n\nIndia went on to win the tournament, defeating New Zealand in the final.\n\nWhile FIFA has yet to comment on any potential workarounds, similar adjustments could be explored to ensure that all qualified teams can participate in the tournament. \n\nHowever, it remains to be seen whether FIFA would be willing to relocate matches or implement alternative measures to accommodate affected nations.\n\nFIFA threatens to ban African country\n\nYEN.com,gh earlier reported that FIFA has warned an African nation that it could face suspension from international football and the 2026 World Cup due to government interference.\n\nThe football governing body issued an official letter, emphasising the need for the country’s football association to operate independently.\n\nSource:

Sherrill as Dems try to avoid humiliating loss in Jersey","text":"Anxious Democrats are hauling out their biggest political star to try to prevent what would be a devastating loss in blue state New Jersey, where former President Barack Obama is stumping Saturday for gubernatorial candidate Rep. Mikie Sherrill.\n\nObama was set to rally with Sherrill, 53, in Newark in an 11th hour bid to boost turnout in her race against Republican Jack Ciattarelli, 63.\n\nObama’s appearance comes after a new shock poll by Atlas Intel Saturday showed Sherrill leading Ciattarelli by less than a single point, 50.2% to 49.3% , less than the margin of error.\n\nMotivating minority Democrats is key to Sherrill’s survival. Newark’s population is nearly 50 percent black and more than a third Hispanic. She leads Ciattarelli 65% to 12% among black voters, and 63% to 18% among Hispanics, according to a Suffolk University poll released Thursday. \n\nObama had already attended a $1.5 million fundraiser for the four-term New Jersey House member, a US Naval Academy grad and retired Navy helicopter pilot. \n\nObama, 64, headlines the rally a year after he campaigned with former Vice President Kamala Harris in Milwaukee in her bid against President Trump. She lost badly anyway.\n\nThere were no indications former President Biden would stump for Sherrill, who on July 9, 2024 called for him to drop out of the race for president. “The stakes are too high — and the threat is too real — to stay silent,” she said at the time.\n\nObama was the most popular living president according to Gallup back in February, with 59 percent approval. Biden was the least popular, at 39 percent.\n\nCiattarelli was set to hold his own event in Monmouth, a day after he told The Post that “The candidate has to go out and win the race. I know my opponent’s bringing in this person, that person. She could bring in the ghost of FDR. It’s not going to matter.”\n\nAn off-year election in a blue state while Republicans hold the White House might typically be the kind that wouldn’t give Democrats heartburn.\n\nBut Sherrill is clinging to a narrow lead of less than 3% in the Real Clear Politics polling average while seeking to succeed term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy (D), in a state Joe Biden carried by 16 percentage points in 2020. Former VP Kamala Harris defeated Donald Trump there by just 52% to 46%.\n\nCiattarelli outperformed the polls four years ago, adding to Democratic anxiety. The Republican National Committee has been surging resources to the state.\n\nShe had a bit of good news in the breakdown of early voting, with Democrats holding an edge in the raw vote count, though by less than 2 percentage points.\n\nSherrill has been trying to run a more centrist campaign while leftists like socialist Zohran Mamdani attract international attention in neighboring New York.\n\nIf Sherrill does lose, it may be due to her flailing answer when asked a basic question about her priorities.\n\n“If you could pass just one piece of legislation, what would it be?” asked her interviewer Marcia Kramer on CBS New York.\n\n“Wow, I would like … that’s a really good question, because there are so many that are coming to mind right now,” she said, desperately stalling for time.\n\nThe answer was “disastrous,” New Jersey State Sen. Holly Schepisi (R), who represents Bergen County, told The Post.\n\nShe has also been dogged by revelations that she didn’t walk during her 1994 graduation from the US Naval Academy commencement. She claims she got penalized because she “didn’t turn in some of my classmates” in an infamous cheating scandal.\n\nCiattarelli, who lost a narrow 51-48 race to Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021, hammered his rival over the interview in his own adds.\n\nHe has the support of Trump, who may be doing him the biggest favor by staying out of New Jersey in the final days of the race. Trump flew to Mar-a-Lago from Washington, DC Friday after his return from Asia. He opted not to go to his Bedminister, New Jersey golf club, which he frequents during the summer months.\n\nThat decision makes sense to Schepisi.\n\n“I think that it’s a very delicate balance where people who do currently support our president were not necessarily motivated four years ago to vote. I think this go-round they are motivated regardless of whether or not the president comes and stumps personally” she said.\n\n“The harm in him doing so is potentially motivating a currently fairly unmotivated base of voters to come out as a protest vote,” she added.\n\n“Enthusiasm is strongly on Jack’s side,” said Bill Palatucci, an RNC member from Jersey. He said he’s been working with the party’s “election integrity team”, which has recruited lawyers in every county. \n\nCiattarelli has faced his own challenge: how to motivate Trump’s base without alienating independents or reachable Democrats in a purple state. \n\nBack in 2015, Ciattarelli said Trump was “not fit to be president.” On the campaign trail this time around, he gave Trump — who held a tele-rally for him last week — an “A” grade on his second term in office.\n\nNew Jersey and Virginia are the only states holding governor’s races Tuesday. Obama also planned an appearance in Norfolk with former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger (Va.), a former CIA officer, who is battling Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.\n\nThe total campaign spending in the race is expected to top $200 million, with the two party committees kicking in a combined $34 million.","summary":"Anxious Democrats are hauling out their biggest political star to try to prevent what would be a humiliating loss in blue state New Jersey as Barack Obama stumps for candidate for governor Mikie Sherrill.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/01/us-news/obama-rallies-with-mikie-sherrill-in-jersey-in-tightening-race/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/114545167-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xDgF9F0I-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-01 18:59:08","author":"Geoff Earle","authors":["Geoff Earle"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.323},{"id":374838356,"title":"'Babies Will Starve': Kamala Harris Slams Trump's $300 Million Ballroom Plan","text":"Access Denied\n\nYou don't have permission to access \"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/babies-will-starve-kamala-harris-slams-donald-trumps-300-million-ballroom-plan-9559199\" on this server.\nReference #18.1d011002.1762027992.2bd03d98\nhttps://errors.edgesuite.net/18.1d011002.1762027992.2bd03d98","summary":"Kamala Harris unleashed a blistering tirade against President Donald Trump, blasting his plan to construct a $300 million ballroom at the White House, an expansion that would reportedly demolish the East Wing.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/babies-will-starve-kamala-harris-slams-donald-trumps-300-million-ballroom-plan-9559199","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 18:40:20","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-1},{"id":374815976,"title":"Harrison Ford says he doesn't 'know of a greater criminal in history' than Trump","text":"\"Indiana Jones\" star Harrison Ford told The Guardian on Friday that he doesn't \"know of a greater criminal in history\" than President Donald Trump, criticizing him for failing to address climate change.

Now the vice president is trying to take up that mantle, appearing at Turning Point USA campus events, like this one at the University of Mississippi, where Vance found himself in an unexpected moment, when a student confronted the vice president about his focus on the US as a Christian nation, given his marriage to Usha Vance, a practicing Hindu. \n\nAnd the student also asked about the administration's hardline stance on immigration. \n\nSTUDENT: How can you, as a vice president, stand there and say that we have too many of them now and we are going to take them out, to people who are here, rightfully so, by paying the money that you guys asked us. You gave us the path and now how can you stop it and tell us we don't belong here anymore? \n\nJD VANCE: The United States should lower its levels of immigration in the future. Just because one person or 10 people or 100 people came in legally and contributed to the United States of America, does that mean that we're thereby committed to let in a million, or 10 million, or 100 million people a year in the future? \n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: The question is, of course, the question that many people have. What is the vision of America that this administration has? And what you hear there JD Vance doing is what he often does. \n\nWhen I interviewed him about this. He often goes to this, which is, why should we let in 100 million people, 10 million people? He takes the maximalist position. Of course nobody wants open borders. Of course nobody wants 100 million people coming into America. But that's not the question she was asking. She was simply asking, why are you trying to prioritize certain types of people? Why are we now having refugees that are white coming in? Why are you saying that this is a Christian nation only, when you, indeed, JD Vance, are married to someone who's a practicing Hindu? I interviewed him, and it was the first time he really talked about his marriage to Usha Vance. \n\nBRADLEY DEVLIN: One of Charlie's other slogans is, if you disagree, get to the front of the line. And I love how the vice president last night, unscripted, for an hour, asked questions of young voters. He talked about, for quite some time with this young woman, about the issue of immigration. He also talked to a young man who's questioning our relationship to Israel, about the United States' Israel policy, about Trump's Israel policy. And so he covered that for an hour. \n\nAnd I just can't help but notice the contrast between this administration versus the administration of Joe Biden, who had prepared people he was going to select in the briefing room, and Kamala [pronounced Ka-MA-la] Harris, who, whenever she came to a studio --\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: KA-ma-la.\n\nDEVLIN: -- had a bunch of demands. KA-ma-la, yeah. She had a bunch of writers, and it was edited --. \n\nCORNISH: It's also priorities. Yeah, but everybody has different priorities. There's a Democrat who's going to come on next week and tell me that I can't believe vice president was there and not fixing the government shutdown. You know what I mean? And it's just interesting. This is the priority.","summary":"Let she who is without pronunciation sin cast the first KA-ma-la.\n\nAt a Turning Point USA event at Ole Miss on Wednesday, JD Vance took unscripted questions from people in attendance, in the tradition of Charlie Kirk. \n\nOn today's CNN This Morning, conservative Bradley Devlin of The Daily Signal praised Vance's willingness to engage in free-wheeling exchanges for an hour.

The “conservative” Alyssa Farah Griffin could only ask if Harris missed any warning signs.\n\nThe biggest event in that interview was co-host Sunny Hostin confessing to the Mom-ala that she felt she’d hurt her chances by asking an obvious question: Where do you differ from Joe Biden? Harris said she couldn’t think of anything.\n\nThat shouldn’t be a destructive question. It’s an obvious question, even if the answer was exploitable.\n\nABC’s “Good Morning America” was no better. Co-host Michael Strahan tiptoed in with Democrat concerns: “There’s some Democrats who said that you don’t take enough responsibility for the loss. How do you respond to that?”\n\nMSNBC’s Rachel Maddow gushed over Harris as the “patron saint of ‘I Told You So,’” and let her subject compare Trump to a communist dictator. We won’t even get into her interviews with Don Lemon and Joy Reid.\n\nAll these Americans looked dreadful when the Harris book tour went international. BBC interviewer Laura Kuenssberg noticed Harris said, “I’m not done,” suggesting another presidential run. She warned: “But when you look at the bookies’ odds, they put you, as an outsider, even behind Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson.” Harris claimed she’s never “listened to polls.”\n\nThat seems obvious, since she dropped out of her first presidential campaign before the primaries even began.\n\nKuenssberg also went after Biden’s cognitive decline: “You write that President Biden didn’t raise his frailty with you, and you write that you didn’t really raise it with him. That’s extraordinary to read in your account.” Harris claimed she didn’t doubt his capacity to serve as president, but he lacked the capacity to run for reelection.\n\nThe BBC anchor was gobsmacked: “Isn’t it a strange message to the public to say, you know, what you need to be tougher and more able to run a political campaign than actually to be the person behind the desk in the Oval Office?” Harris stuck to her line.\n\nThen came Australia’s ABC. Interviewer Sarah Ferguson also pressed on the decline question: “Didn’t you also have a responsibility? You were one of the people in the room. … Didn’t you have a responsibility as an American to step up and say something at that point?”\n\nHarris insisted: “I did not question Joe Biden’s capacity to be president at all.”\n\nFerguson blamed Biden: “Wasn’t his refusal to recognize his own frailties the reason that you faced a nearly impossible task?”\n\nWhen Harris shifted to saying Trump was the real challenge, Ferguson called her out: “I want to interrupt you because that is a world-class pivot, but it is not the question that I asked you, which is about Joe Biden’s failure to recognize his own frailties and what that did to you. The question is about Joe Biden. Are you still reluctant to criticize the former president?”\n\nHarris answered: “In what regard, please?” Ferguson restated her thesis that Biden damaged her chances. Harris repeated: “He was not frail as president of the United States.”\n\nThis was about as accurate as comparing Trump to a communist dictator. It’s a colossal shame that American journalists can’t ask the questions that foreigners can.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

It’s pretty shocking.”\n\nIn September, Musk and Trump were spotted sitting next to each other at Charlie Kirk's funeral, with the entrepreneur later posting a picture of them talking, providing a brief explanation for their reunion. \n\nTrump later revealed more about what happened, as he told reporters: \"Elon came over and said hello.

I felt like I was running around like a chicken with my head cut off.”\n\nDuring last year’s presidential election, the No Hard Feelings actor endorsed Kamala Harris, telling People magazine at the time that her decision was largely based on “abortion being on the ballot.”\n\nOn the podcast she questioned what impact celebrities can even have on the political atmosphere.\n\n“But as we’ve learned, election after election, celebrities do not make a difference whatsoever on who people vote for,” Lawrence said. “So then what am I doing? I’m just sharing my opinion on something that’s going to add fuel to a fire that’s ripping the country apart. We are so divided.”\n\nDue to her job as an actor and an “artist,” Lawrence explained that she does not want to turn people away from any of her projects simply because of her political beliefs.\n\nHowever, despite her hesitancy to speak about her opinion on politics, she does try to express her beliefs through what movies and projects her production company chooses to take on, such as the abortion documentary Zurawski v Texas.\n\n“A lot of movies coming out from my production company are expressions of the political landscape, and that’s how I feel like I can be helpful,” she said. \n\nWhen asked if she regretted how she spoke during Trump’s first term, Lawrence said, “Probably? I regret everything I’ve ever done or said.”\n\n“I’m going to take the zip drives out of all of these cameras when I leave. The second term feels different. Because he said what he was going to do.

While this remains largely true, new research shows that Britons from both the left and right are considerably more forthright than their American counterparts on immigration policy questions.\n\nVoters for British right-wing parties are radically more likely to agree with statements such as “it is bad for society if white people decline as a share of the population” and “society is weakened by being made up of many different races, ethnicities, and religions”, the polling finds.\n\nThe remarkable results come from a preview of a forthcoming paper by the National Centre for Social Research, entitled UK and US Attitudes: Two Sides of the Same Coin? trailed in finance-focused British globalist-centre-left publication, The Financial Times. The organisation took questions already well polled and understood by U.S. pollsters and asked exactly the same of British respondents, giving a realistic side-by-side comparison.\n\nWith 2,000 respondents asked, it isn’t a mega-poll, but it is still twice the size of a typical UK political pollster’s sample.\n\nIt found the United Kingdom remains to the left of America on every national policy and social issue question — such as taxation and abortion among others — except for questions of immigration and diversity, at least suggesting that decades of British governments ignoring popular sentiment on border control has pushed the population rightward.\n\nSome of the gaps in willingness to show agreement on some migration concepts between British and American respondents are vast, and all the more astonishing given that expressing some of the sentiments that seem to enjoy widespread support among the British would likely invite a police investigation in the UK, where there are no constitutional guarantees of free speech.\n\nAsked whether they agree with the statement “We risk losing our national identity if we are too open to people from all over the world”, a massive 81 per cent of people who voted for either the Conservative Party or Nigel Farage’s Reform Party at the last General Election said they would agree, compared to 65 per cent of U.S. Trump voters. Among British Labour Party voters, there is no majority for this notion, but it is still striking that 34 per cent agree, compared to just 12 per cent of 2024 Kamala Harris voters.\n\nIndeed, British left-wing voters are to the right of Kamala Harris supporters in every one of these metrics.\n\nOn the statement “It is bad for society if white people decline as a share of the population”, 70 per cent of UK right-wingers agree, a full 27 points ahead of Trump voters, who agreed 43 per cent of the time. On the left, 24 per cent of Labour voters said yes, while just 9 per cent of Harris voters agreed.\n\nAsked whether they are “uncomfortable with people speaking a foreign language in public places”, 66 per cent of British Conservative and Reform voters agreed. Trump supporters do not share this sentiment as broadly, with just 47 per cent agreeing, followed by Labour voters at 28 per cent, and Kamala Harris supporters at 17 per cent.\n\nAgain, on ethnic homogeneity, a majority of right-wingers in Britain said they agreed that “society is weakened by being made up of many different races, ethnicities, and religions”. A majority of 52 per cent said that was the case, well over double the number of American conservatives who said they thought so, who came in at 19 per cent. Those Trump voters only came in a little ahead of British Labour supporters, who agreed 14 per cent of the time. Least of all were Kamala Harris voters, who agreed with statistically negligible frequency at three per cent.\n\nThe Financial Times cited Sir John Curtice, a renowned British psephologist and political scientist, who said the results once again underlined the new dividing lines in British politics. These lines, which had been over economic policy in past decades, now revolve around social issues, characterising the right as more concerned with sovereignty than fiscal probity. They share this with U.S. President Donald Trump, who said that they “think that Britain should run itself”.","summary":"Voters across the political spectrum in the UK are more likely to hold strong views on immigration and ethnic homogeneity than Americans.\n\n\nThe post Overton Window Speedrun: British Voters Now More Right-Wing on Immigration Than Americans appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/11/01/overton-window-speedrun-british-voters-now-more-right-wing-on-immigration-than-americans/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/10/GettyImages-2230773719-2-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 10:44:59","author":"Oliver JJ Lane","authors":["Oliver JJ Lane"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.207},{"id":374733664,"title":"Victor Davis Hanson: Democrats Have to Lose One More Time Before They Abandon the Party","text":"Why are California Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris suddenly praising Joe Biden’s presidency? Victor Davis Hanson breaks down the political theater behind the Democrats’ about-face—and what it reveals about their panic over President Donald Trump’s comeback. This, and more, on today’s edition of “Victor Davis Hanson: In His Own Words.\n\nThis interview has been slightly edited for clarity. Sami Winc: I didn’t quite finish with what I was gonna talk about with [California Gov. Gavin] Newsom and [former Vice President Kamala] Harris. And that is that they are recently coming out, both of them, saying that [former President] Joe Biden was either one of the best presidents in recent memory, I think that was Newsom, or with Kamala Harris, where she doesn’t have any criticism of Joe, he was good, he did a good job.\n\nWhat is that all about? I mean, he was obviously—but do they get a constituency from that? Is that what they’re worried about? The Democratic Party has this vast constituency, so I’m gonna say anything I need to do.\n\nVictor Davis Hanson: They don’t believe that. They’re worried that—they’re worried about the record, which American people saw, the Trump first term and they saw the Biden term. And then they listened to what President Donald Trump said his second term was. And they said, “We do not want the Biden agenda anymore.” That was No. 1.\n\nNo. 2, they removed him. They, the Democratic donors, the Democratic politicos, the left-wing media. They got in a room and said, “Joe, get out.” And he said, “No, I don’t want to get out. I got 14—.” And Jill said, “We’re not going to get rid of him. Good ol’ Joe is as sharp as a tack.”\n\nBut it took about a month. And then they said, Joe said, “Wow, the donors aren’t going to give me any money. The media is going to attack me.” So, they had a coup. And they just took him off the ticket. And then they had no election, no primary. They put a person, they took a person who’d won 14 million primary votes in 2020, and they appointed his vice president, had never won a single delegate, without any discussion. And then they ratified by a fake delegate vote at the convention.\n\nSo, they took him out, and they took him out because it was a disaster. And now they look back and Trump is, I’ll quote Shakespeare, he doth bestride like a Colossus over these nonentities.\n\nSo, they’re really angry and they said, “Well, we didn’t remove him because he was bad. We didn’t remove him because he was failing. We just thought that he needed a break.”\n\nSo, now they’re going back and saying the record was actually pretty good because he didn’t do it, we did. We had a coup, basically. We ran the government. It was wonderful.\n\nBut what Trump needs to do—kind of said this in one of our Daily Signal short pieces. No more cartoons where he’s in a jet spraying people with defecation, all that. You don’t need to go back and fight back and forth on the libs and all that stuff. Just look at the record.\n\nTen thousand people coming in a day, some days, illegally. Somewhere between, if you count illegal entrance, probably 10 million to 12 million. And if you count actual people who stayed, probably 7 million or 8 million. Zero now. Zero. They’re going to get 2 million deportations, whether coerced or self-deported, in a year.\n\nIf you look at—we’re pumping a million barrels more of oil already than Biden did. He drained the petroleum reserve by 200 million barrels. Trump is already filling it right now as I speak. It’s up to 406 barrels. He’s got a plan to fill the whole thing.\n\nHe’s had seven ceasefires. He’s flying all over the world. He stopped the killing in Gaza. He ended the nuclear threat in the near future.\n\nIf we had this conversation a year ago, we’d say, “Man, we can’t stop Hezbollah. They’re too tough. Iran is just crazy. They’ve got, all together, these guys—Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis, Iran—they’ve got over 200,000 rockets.”\n\nThey’re all inert now. They’re all inert because Trump stood by Israel, gave them the supplies, no suspension, said, “Go to it,” then took out, himself, a nuclear plant.\n\nAnd then when you look at inflation, the average inflation was 5%, as we said, under Biden, over that four-year period. It’s going to be about 3% this year. He left office when it was 1.7%.\n\nThe first time, if you look at [gross domestic product], say that GDP is, it’s going to be about 3%. If you look at the stock market, it set a record this week. It’s never been higher. They said it was going to crash in March. If you look at trade revenue, you have one of these rare months in September where we had more money coming into the Treasury than going out. \n\nThe deficit, for all the “Big, Beautiful Bill’s” spending, the deficit’s gonna go down. Not a lot, but somewhat.\n\nSo, when you look at the—and then, you know, when he talked about DEI, would say he can’t get rid of DEI. These people are formidable. He just got rid of it. He got rid of it. All of a sudden, why do you think that people who say that they’re considering transitioning has dropped dramatically on campuses? Because it’s no longer cool. And there’s no longer kind of a fad.\n\nBecause he said, “If you’re biological male, I don’t care what you call me, a transphobe, you’re not going to go and destroy female sports. And you’re not going to have laws that say that people who expose themselves to the opposite sex with their genitalia have to go to jail, and then we’re going to let men go in and shower with preteen girls. We’re not going to let that happen.”\n\nAnd so, he wrecked them. He went after them. It’s really an astounding achievement if he would just talk about it. \n\nWinc: Yes, and you’ve convinced me why, if I were a Democrat, I wouldn’t want to be a backer of Joe Biden or say, really, anything about him—at least not in a positive sense.\n\nSo, if I’m in an interview and I’m Kamala Harris, I’m going to say, “Well, Joe Biden did what he could do as best he could. However you say that, I don’t care. But I have ideas of things that we could do better and da da da,” and start at least that.\n\nBut why are these Democrats doubling down on a presidency that was a complete disaster? Because, just as what you’ve just told me, there’s no way it’s been so drastically changed today by Trump himself. \n\nHanson: But what I’m saying is that that was a presidency in which, for the first time since the New Deal, the socialist Left had an opening. They ran a moderate candidate who was losing because he was senile in 2020. He lost the first three primaries and caucuses—New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada.\n\nThen [Rep. Jim] Clyburn said, “You know what, I don’t want to vote for these white liberal socialists.” And he went to Biden and said, “I will deliver the black vote in South Carolina, and you will win. But we have certain demands on you about appointments, black judges, black this, black vice president.”\n\nAnd then the socialists came to him and said, “We will get [Sen. Elizabeth Warren out], we’ll get [Sen.] Bernie [Sanders] out, we’ll get [Pete] Buttigieg, but you’re going to open that border and you’re going to get [George] Soros DAs and you’re going to go through defund the police, and you’re going to go radical, Green New Deal.”\n\nAnd they got everything they wanted. So then, they got it and they destroyed the country, and the people turned on them. So now, what are they going to say? Are they going to say, “Well, we had a George McGovern and we corrected with Bill Clinton after 20 years”? No.\n\nSo, that’s what they have to say. We have [Sen. John] Fetterman. He’s basically said, “We have a message that people do not want, so we need to correct.” But they’re not going to do that until they lose again. They have to lose at least once more in a national election. They have to lose the midterms. Otherwise, they’ll keep at it. \n\nWinc: Yeah. He seems to be, Fetterman, the persona non grata in the Democratic Party right now, so he doesn’t get any kudos for saying that kind of thing.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Harris didn’t appear to have many ideas besides vowing to continue whatever President Joe Biden was doing. I didn’t find the inflation thanks to Bidenomics to be particularly enjoyable and anyone who thinks price controls is a good idea can’t be taken seriously.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of specific policy actions I can generally appreciate. His administration ordered 10 regulations be repealed for every new one issued. He also ensured the income tax cuts from his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act were extended, which is great, since I’d rather waste my own money than have the government waste my money. All good so far.\n\nAnd intangibly, it appears his election popped the woke bubble that engulfed the culture the last several years. The Democratic Party lost its mind over the last decade and became fixated on skin color and genitals to the detriment of its (formerly) working-class base. Meanwhile, the wokesters got busy destroying every institution they touched, from amateur sports to entertainment to media to tech. And if you dared point that out, you had to prepare to be called a racist, sexist, transphobe, all that. So, good riddance to that.\n\nThat’s basically my list of positives: He’s not Kamala Harris, he popped the woke bubble, he’s done some deregulatory things and cut some taxes.\n\nBut what’s on the other side of the ledger?\n\nWell, the biggest problems with the second Trump term are the horrible precedents he’s setting that will definitely be abused by future administrations.\n\nWhere to start?\n\nWell, he started his presidency very early on with a mass firing of U.S. inspectors general. These are the people specifically tasked to serve as independent watchdogs within federal agencies. Call me naive, but I’m pretty sure you want people in place to investigate reports of waste, fraud and abuse. What could go wrong?\n\nHe appointed well-established conspiracy theorists like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to positions of authority and takes advice from conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, who, among other things, spread the idea the “deep state” engineered a winter storm during the 2024 Iowa caucuses to help Nikki Haley. When there are no more standards, beyond loyalty to the president, how can one ever effectively criticize future administration picks?\n\nThere are also his trade policies. He’s unilaterally imposed and threatened to impose steep taxes on goods from all over the world, which incentivizes businesses and countries to woo him, the president of the United States, to get special carveouts and special treatment. That’s a blatant invitation for cronyism and corruption. It’s allowed him to essentially shake down companies for the privilege to do business, like his 15% tax on Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices in exchange for “allowing” them to do business in China.\n\nImagine if Barack Obama or Joe Biden did that? I can imagine the Glenn Beck “Obama is a Kenyan Communist” charts already. The same people who are defending Trump for doing this would be declaring the Bolsheviks have taken over if Obama imposed tariffs on everything.\n\nThen there’s his war on the media, specifically the legacy media because he’s a boomer and thinks they still have the sway they had decades ago. Now, look, I get it. Mainstream media outlets have definitely leaned left and have definitely treated Trump far more critically than they treated Biden or Obama. But, ultimately, so what? Legacy media outlets, from newspapers to television broadcasters, are just a shrinking piece of a vast media market. Podcasters and streamers get more views than television networks, while partisan propaganda outlets like the Daily Wire and niche Substackers draw subscription numbers rivaling or exceeding nationally recognized newspapers.\n\nWith or without this context in mind, the Trump administration has threatened broadcast licenses (remember the ridiculous Jimmy Kimmel saga?) and Trump has personally sued media outlets for things as frivolous as editing an interview with Kamala Harris for broadcast. For a supposed champion of “free speech,” he’s sure been happy to flex his muscle to crack down on speech he doesn’t like.\n\nEven more pernicious is the chilling effect government crackdowns have on the press. If media institutions that strive to be objective start pulling their punches, that’s only to the benefit of the powerful. Imagine the hypocritical outrage to come when President Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez cracks down on right-wing outlets for misinformation and sues conservative podcasters into submission.\n\nThen there’s the militarized and thuggish execution of immigration enforcement policy Trump has unleashed. ProPublica documented 170 instances of American citizens held by immigration agents. As they reported, “Americans have been dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot by immigration agents. They’ve had their necks kneeled on. They’ve been held outside in the rain while in their underwear. At least three citizens were pregnant when agents detained them.”\n\nAn America where Americans are numb to seeing masked federal agents disappear people for showing up to work on a house at a day labor site is an America that’s no longer recognizable.\n\nRemember when even right-wingers got mad at Obama for signing a National Defense Authorization Act that included indefinite detention powers? Remember when right-wingers at least had a part of them that got mad about what the government did at Waco and Ruby Ridge? Suddenly, many of these same people are happy to embrace the idea of federal agents running around arresting disabled American teenagers (yes, this happened) and trying to deport kids with cancer.\n\nWhen the right — ostensibly the faction most inclined to resist federal tyranny — suddenly thinks unleashing federal agents is the key to a better America, we’re definitely heading toward Big Government authoritarianism.\n\nThis column is getting long, but I could keep going.\n\nSo far, Trump has done a good job of eviscerating the apparently quaint ideas of capitalism, limited government, fiscal responsibility. The next time Democrats come to power, will Republicans and young conservatives even remember what any of those ideas are? They’ve spent so much time on their mental gymnastics this past decade — will they even have the memory to offer conservative-ish, free market-ish, limited government-ish critiques of Democratic overreach?\n\nSal Rodriguez can be reached at salrodriguez@scng.com","summary":"Sal Rodriguez- The MAGA hangover will be brutal","url":"https://www.presstelegram.com/2025/10/31/sal-rodriguez-the-maga-hangover-will-be-brutal/","image":"https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OCR-L-POM-1124-07.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 08:31:13","author":"Gqlshare","authors":["Gqlshare"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.083},{"id":374710562,"title":"Death Toll Reaches 700 in Tanzania's Bloody Post-Election Protests","text":"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - At least 700 people have reportedly been killed in Tanzania after taking to the streets to protest the results of this week's presidential election, France 24 reported. Citizens are discontent with the re-election of the increasingly authoritarian incumbent, Samia Suluhu Hassan, who ran unopposed after her main challengers were jailed or barred from the race.Hundreds of people were killed during the three-day election protests in the country, said the main opposition party on Friday, October 30, 2025. Despite the high death toll, people continued protesting amidst internet blackouts.\"As we speak the figure for deaths in Dar (es Salaam) is around 350 and for Mwanza it is 200-plus. Added to figures from other places around the country, the overall figure is around 700,\" said John Kitoka, the spokesperson for the main opposition party, Chadema.\"The death toll could be much higher,\" he warned. He mentioned that the killings could have occurred during the nighttime curfew.President Samia Suluhu Hassan, whose government is accused of conducting a campaign of repression, has sought to strengthen her position. She silenced criticism within her party in an election with almost no competitors, as her main challenger was either imprisoned or barred from standing.The Wednesday election turned into chaos as huge crowds took to the streets in Dar es Salaam and other cities. The masses tore down her posters and attacked the police and polling stations, which led to internet shutdowns and curfews.Due to the ban on most foreign journalists covering the elections and the communication blockade entering its third day, information from the field has become scarce.Chadema, which was banned from participating in the election, stated that the protesters marched towards the city center in Dar es Salaam on Friday. The masses were met with a heavy presence of police and military.A security source stated that they had heard reports of over 500 deaths, possibly 700-800 nationwide. Many hospitals and health clinics were too afraid to speak directly to journalists.Local news sites have not been updated since Wednesday, and Hassan has not commented on the riots yet. The only official statement came from military chief Jacob Mkunda on Thursday night. He referred to the protesters as criminals.In Zanzibar, a popular tourist destination, Hassan's ruling party was declared the winner of the local polls on Thursday.The opposition party, ACT-Wazalendo, rejected the results. \"They have robbed the people of Zanzibar of their voice... The only solution to deliver justice is through a fresh election,\" they said.A senior party official stated that ballot boxes had been filled. People had been allowed to vote multiple times without identification, and their election monitors had been expelled from the vote-counting room.At an opposition supporters' meeting in Zanzibar, there was anxiety and fear. \"There has never been a credible election since 1995,\" said a 70-year-old man, referring to Tanzania's first multiparty elections.No one interviewed mentioned their names. \"We are afraid of speaking because they might come to our houses and pick us up,\" said one of them.Hassan has faced opposition from some military and allies of her stubborn predecessor, John Magufuli, since taking over after his death in 2021, analysts said. They said that she wanted an outright victory to strengthen her position.

Trump was interviewed by CBS’s Norah O’Donnell on Friday at Mar-a-Lago for the appearance, which will air this Sunday.The president has an uneasy history with television’s most popular newsmagazine. But he has signalled friendlier relations with CBS News after the takeover of its parent company this summer by new Paramount CEO David Ellison, the son of wealthy supporter Larry Ellison.CBS News offered few details Friday on how the interview came together, or whether there were any ground rules put in place. O’Donnell, the former “CBS Evening News” anchor, is not one of the show’s regular correspondents.Trump walked out of a “60 Minutes” interview with correspondent Lesley Stahl shortly before the 2020 election, complaining of bias, and his team released an unedited transcript of the conversation. Despite invitations, he did not agree to a “60 Minutes” interview during the 2024 election campaign. But he complained that the newsmagazine’s interview with Harris, his Democratic opponent, was edited deceptively to make her look good.CBS News strongly denied any wrongdoing, but Trump filed a lawsuit against the company. Paramount decided to pay Trump $16 million to settle the case this summer, shortly before the Federal Communications Commission approved Paramount’s merger with Ellison’s Skydance Media. In the wake of the Trump lawsuit, “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens resigned this past spring, saying that it was becoming clear that he could no longer run the program independently.Since taking over at Paramount, Ellison has sent signals of a closer relationship with Trump. He hired Kenneth Weinstein, the former head of a conservative think tank and a donor to Trump’s 2024 campaign, to serve in a role investigating complaints that the network had shown bias in its reporting.Paramount also purchased the Free Press website in October and named its founder, Bari Weiss, as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News. Weiss reportedly had a role in booking the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and aide Steve Witkoff for a “60 Minutes” interview two weeks ago, talking about the peace deal in Gaza. Flying back from the Middle East on Oct. 12, Trump told reporters that “Larry Ellison is great, and his son David is great. They’re friends of mine. They’re big supporters of mine, and they’ll do the right thing.”","summary":"President Donald Trump is set to appear on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; this Sunday, marking his first interview with the CBS

company over a 2024 “60 Minutes” segment featuring then–Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe interview, which airs Sunday on “60 Minutes,” was filmed Friday at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, according to the news site Semafor — and comes just weeks after Bari Weiss took the helm of the network. \n\nEarlier this month, Semafor was first to report that Trump was in talks on a possible interview with “60 Minutes,” the long-running television newsmagazine.\n\nAccording to CBS, O’Donnell’s conversation with the president spanned a wide range of topics, including his recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, US relations with Venezuela and Israel, the ongoing government shutdown and the administration’s new immigration and National Guard policies.\n\nThe network posted a preview story on its websites showing O’Donnell sitting across from Trump at his estate on Friday.\n\nThe high-profile sitdown comes just months after Paramount paid Trump $16 million to settle his lawsuit alleging the Harris interview was deceptively edited to benefit his opponent during the 2024 campaign.\n\nThough the settlement included no apology or admission of wrongdoing, it paved the way for a truce between the White House and CBS News.\n\nEarlier this year, CBS News pledged to publish the full transcripts of future presidential interviews and air unedited versions of major political sitdowns on programs like “Face the Nation” and “60 Minutes.”\n\nFor Trump, the interview offers an opportunity to re-engage with a major broadcast network he has long derided as part of the “fake news media.”\n\nHis relationship with CBS appears to be warming under the network’s new ownership.\n\nDuring a recent conversation aboard Air Force One, Trump praised Paramount CEO David Ellison and his father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, calling them “great people” who “understand fairness.”\n\nThe interview will air during a period of turbulence and upheaval at the Tiffany Network’s news division.\n\nThe decision to feature Trump on “60 Minutes” is just the latest indication that CBS News is eager to turn the page under the leadership of Weiss, who became editor-in-chief in October following Paramount’s acquisition by Skydance Media.\n\nWeiss, a former opinion editor for the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times who founded the Free Press, has promised to steer the network toward a more independent, “trust-first” editorial approach.\n\nHer tenure has already drawn both praise and controversy amid layoffs and internal restructuring.\n\nCBS has also made a series of editorial policy changes in the wake of its settlement with Trump.\n\nThe interview will air during a period of turbulence and upheaval at the Tiffany Network’s news division.\n\nCBS News has laid off roughly 100 employees — including several high-profile correspondents and anchors — as part of a broader cost-cutting effort under its new parent company, Paramount Skydance.\n\nThe cuts affected on-air, production, and digital staff, and coincided with the cancellation of two streaming shows, a major overhaul of “CBS Saturday Morning” and the disbanding of the network’s race and culture unit.\n\nAmong those let go were Michelle Miller, Dana Jacobson, Lisa Ling, Debora Patta, Janet Shamlian, Nancy Chen and Nikki Battiste — all women, with half reportedly women of color.\n\nThe layoffs have sparked internal frustration and allegations of discrimination after at least one former producer claimed that people of color were disproportionately targeted while white colleagues were reassigned instead.\n\nThe reductions come amid sweeping restructuring following Paramount’s $8 billion merger with Skydance Media, which aims to trim about $2 billion in operating costs and reduce roughly 10% of the company’s global workforce.","summary":"The interview, which airs Sunday on \"60 Minutes,\" was filmed Friday at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in

Who cares? Reform UK doesn’t seem to. This week, the party’s Hamble Valley branch was criticised after an apparently AI-generated group portrait was spotted on its About page. The image – featuring 12 grinning adults, clad in navy and beige jackets, staring suspiciously straight-on into the “camera” – was captioned with the words: “Real People – Not Career Politicians.” You couldn’t make it up!\n\nThe alleged AI flop was picked up by the X account @PoliticsMoments – and within a day, Hamble Valley’s website was taken down. Not before commentators had feasted on the irony, though. Eastleigh News was quick to point out that the uncanny image includes a black man, just days after the Reform MP Sarah Pochin said that it “drives me mad seeing adverts full of black and Asian people”. But when did AI slop ever make sense anyway?\n\nMy Instagram Explore page, long a deranged, hallucinatory place, has become more unhinged than ever in recent months: Donald Trump getting down on his knees and unbuckling Benjamin Netanyahu’s belt. Queen Liz getting a fresh trim in a barber shop. Kim Jong Un biting a Labubu. I’m ashamed to admit that I’ve too often found myself lying in bed, clutching my iPhone, smirking, even laughing out loud, at these demented videos. Humour thrives off combining incongruous things and it’s precisely these illogical collisions that make AI slop so entertaining.

The 79-year-old US president recently shared a video of himself in a fighter jet plane, dropping bombs of faeces on protesters in Times Square – one of at least 62 AI-generated images or videos he’s shared on Truth Social since late 2022, according to the New York Times. Trump has shared depictions of himself in a glittering array of alternative lives: arm in arm with Elvis Presley; rocking out on stage with an electric guitar; posing as the Pope.\n\nSome of Trump’s generative-AI posts are overtly racist – such as a video depiction of Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader of the US House of Representatives, wearing a sombrero, with a mariachi band in the background. But others feel… wholesome. Trump cuddling a duck. Trump clutching a cat wearing glasses. And yet even the most innocuous-seeming images are injected with Maga ideology.\n\nTake all the cutesy animal stuff. Trump began sharing it after his first debate with Kamala Harris, during which he claimed (without evidence) that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were consuming cats and dogs. In the AI-generated images, Trump is depicted as a heroic saviour, rescuing the whimpering, doe-eyed animals who hold up signs like “Kamala hates me” and “Don’t let them eat us. Vote for Trump!”. Propelled by social media algorithms, these sappy cat memes metastasise, invigorating the Maga fanbase and perpetuating their xenophobic claims.\n\nThis may all feel like a particularly 21st-century flavour of politics, but humour and absurdism have long been utilised by authoritarian leaders to promote radical alternative narratives. The Nazi’s ministry of propaganda made over 1,200 feature films, about half of which were comedies and some were mockumentaries. “They look like bad Hollywood knock-offs,” Valerie Weinstein, an expert in Nazi propaganda and the comedy films produced by the Third Reich, told the Guardian. “In none of them do you see that there’s a war going on, that there are shortages. They’re existing in this sort of fantasy.”\n\nAI slop operates in a similar way: it prioritises fantasy over accuracy, surrealness over realism, vibes over substance. The most impactful content isn’t necessarily coherent or believable. Remember the dystopian “Trump Gaza” clip that the president shared on Instagram earlier this year – a stomach-churning rendition of the Palestinian territory’s future featuring Elon Musk eating a copious amount of hummus and a topless Trump and Netanyahu drinking cocktails.\n\nTo many, this AI rendition simply reified the ethnic cleansing in Gaza that other politicians were discussing euphemistically. But one scene seemed to counteract Trump’s politics: a shot of bearded bellydancers. Trump shared the video just over a month after signing the executive order declaring that only two sexes would be recognised in the US, making this brief, joyous depiction of gender-fluid identity feel incongruous.\n\nBut in a dizzying, digitally mediated world, bewildering contradictions like these command attention. Adverts are increasingly off-kilter. Companies are deliberately using sloppy slogans and repulsive imagery to make us look and keep us looking. Social media algorithms, which reward extreme content, turbocharge this process. The weirder the content, the more we engage with it, the further it travels across our feeds. According to a study conducted by London School of Economics, racially charged imagery containing AI-generated components receive disproportionately more views than traditional media.\n\nWonky alt-right AI-generated imagery has been slipping into the British political consciousness, too. A medieval knight soaked in blood holding up the French flag, captioned: “Our hearts beat English forever”. A knight wearing a shield painted with the Serbian coat of arms branded with the words: “For the flag, for the land, for ENGLAND”. Despite these heraldic errors, the posts receive hundreds of likes.\n\nRight-wing politicians know this all too well. In August, Nigel Farage shared an AI-generated video of him wearing a big, white fur coat and a gold chain, rapping, with Union Jacks shooting out his eyes. “Nigel Farage: Prime Minister of the pub, of the pint, of the people. Bo selecta!” he says. The video is ridiculous, and that’s what makes it so sharable. \n\nFarage captioned the video “a little bit of fun” – but if Trump’s maximalist AI machine is anything to go by, this type of content is far from harmless. We will doubtless see more AI slop from hard-right leaders in the UK, getting more eyes on xenophobic ideas. Absurd computer-generated content makes the world feel weirder and more surreal, eroding our desire to discern truth from fabrication. I’m certainly guilty of binging on dumb, dopamine-dinging crap. But as we get sucked into the brain-curdling universes of our respective iPhones, we should be wary of what we are watching and the alt-right voices slipping seamlessly into our minds.\n\n[Further reading: Big tech’s futile attempt to kill death]","summary":"Surreal imagery has been slipping into the British political consciousness.

No, I believe he was fully competent to serve,' she said. \n\n'Do you really?' Stewart responded. \n\n'I do,' Harris said, to which Stewart said: 'That surprises me, actually.' \n\nHarris defended Biden's repeat gaffes before ending his re-election run as being down to the pressures of the campaign trail, saying that he still had the 'stamina to govern' behind the scenes. \n\n'Being a candidate for president of the United States is about being in a marathon at a sprinter’s pace, having tomatoes thrown at you every step you take,' she said. \n\n'And to be the seated president, the sitting president while doing that – it’s a lot. It’s a lot.' \n\nStewart did not appear impressed by Harris' stance on Biden's competency, and questioned whether a person who struggled campaigning had the ability to lead a nation.\n\n'I think it’s a hard case to make for people that he didn’t have the stamina to run, but he had the stamina to govern,' he said. \n\nStewart asked Harris about why she stood behind Biden throughout her campaign and backed many of his policies, to which she said she 'cared about him deeply.' \n\n'I did not want to pile on with all the criticism that he was facing. I didn’t think it was necessary,' Harris said. \n\n'I do realize also in reflection that I did not fully understand how big of an issue it was for some people, for me to distinguish myself from him. I felt that the distinction between he and I was pretty clear.'\n\n'Knowing what I know now, I would’ve probably approached it a bit differently,' she added.\n\nHarris appeared on the podcast as part of her promotion tour for her new book 107 Days, which detailed her perspective on her four-month campaign for the White House. \n\nThe former Vice President has come under scrutiny for some references in her book, including a candid admission that she regretted not pushing Biden out of the 2024 campaign sooner. \n\nIn an excerpt of the book, Harris admitted: 'During all those months of growing panic, should I have told Joe to consider not running? Perhaps.\n\n'Of all the people in the White House, I was in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out. I knew it would come off to him as incredibly self-serving if I advised him not to run.'\n\n'He would see it as naked ambition, perhaps as poisonous disloyalty,' she wrote.\n\nHarris also revealed that going into the 2024 campaign, she automatically followed the 'mantra' set by the White House that it was Biden's decision to make with his family if he wanted to run for reelection.\n\n'Was it grace, or was it recklessness?' Harris asked. 'In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.'\n\nHarris's remarks about Biden's standing in her book led former aides to the president to attack her soon after she began her promotional tour. \n\nOne former Biden White House official told Axios in September that Harris was 'simply not good at the job.'\n\n'She had basically zero substantive role in any of the administration's key work streams, and instead would just dive bomb in for stilted photo ops that exposed how out of depth she was,' the official scathed. \n\nAnother ex-official said that Harris could not blame Biden for losing her 2024 campaign, despite her claim that '107 days', as her book is named, was not enough time to run a successful campaign.\n\n'The independent variable there is the vice president, not Biden or his aides,' the aide said.","summary":"Harris said she regretted not drawing a clearer distinction between herself and Biden during her unsuccessful run for the presidency, but insisted she was 'not talking about competence.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-15245857/Jon-Stewart-Kamala-Harris-Biden-competency-podcast-surprised.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/31/19/103493675-0-image-m-19_1761940175625.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/30/6901348193001452702/1024x576_MP4_6901348193001452702.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-01 02:44:16","author":"Editor,Will Potter","authors":["Editor","Will Potter"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.234},{"id":374621184,"title":"Trump scheduled to appear on 60 Minutes with Norah O’Donnell","text":"Donald Trump is scheduled to appear on CBS's 60 Minutes for an in-depth interview covering topics such as China, Venezuela and immigration. \n\nThis interview follows a $16 million settlement between Trump and CBS, after he sued the network alleging deceptive editing of a Kamala Harris interview on 60 Minutes. \n\nThe dispute led to a 60 Minutes producer resigning and Stephen Colbert criticizing the settlement as a “bribe” before his Late Show was cancelled. \n\nA controversial merger between Paramount and Skydance, led by the son of a Trump supporter, was approved, placing CBS News under new leadership. \n\nBari Weiss, a former New York Times opinion writer, now heads CBS News, where she has overseen layoffs and reportedly used her connections to secure interviews with Trump allies.","summary":"","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/bulletin/news/trump-60-minutes-interview-cbs-b2856494.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/31/18/47/GettyImages-2244363066.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xgaaYRH8-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-01 01:56:23","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.259},{"id":374622348,"title":"JD Vance becomes his own meme on Halloween: US Vice-President's hilarious costume breaks the internet.

And for much of that time it has been in power – far more than any other political party anywhere else.\n\nWhile other parties came and went in historic political transformations – Whig to Liberal, Liberal to Labour, Labour to New Labour – the Tories remained a constant.\n\nNo longer. For the first time ever the very survival of the Tories is on the line.\n\nAfter 14 desultory years in power, they won less than 24 per cent of the vote at the last election, their worst share since 1835. In the 2019 election they'd won by almost a landslide, with 44 per cent of the vote. So the collapse in five years was precipitous.\n\nAnd since the Tories' historic defeat, things have only got worse. The latest polls put the Tories on around 17 per cent, sometimes lower, sometimes behind not just Labour but also the centre-Left Liberal Democrats, the all-purpose trash can of British politics.\n\nThey now have only 119 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons. On current polling, if a general election were held today, they'd be reduced to a rump of under 45 seats.\n\nBy contrast, their new rival on the populist Right, Nigel Farage's Reform, is regularly over 30 per cent in the polls and rising. If that vote share was replicated in a general election Reform would, at the very least, emerge as the largest party.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, an Ipsos poll found that more people wanted Farage as PM than Sir Keir Starmer.\n\nIndeed, Labour's share of the vote is almost as dire as the Tories'. Though elected by a landslide a mere 15 months ago – but on only 34 per cent of the vote (Labour's victory was as wide as the ocean but as deep as the village pond) – the latest polls show Labour struggling to hold on to 20 per cent of the vote.\n\nLabour's national collapse is the steepest, fastest falling off of any British government in modern times. Fifteen months into Tony Blair's first landslide victory in 1997 Labour was still 20 points ahead in the polls. Now Labour can barely manage 20 points in total.\n\nWhen Margaret Thatcher won her landslides in 1983 and 1987, she did so with around 44 per cent of the vote. Ditto Tony Blair in his landslides of 1997 and 2001.\n\nBut today Labour and Conservative cannot even muster a 40 per cent share combined. If a general election were held tomorrow, half the Labour Cabinet would lose their seats along with two-thirds of the parliamentary party.\n\nBut it would be even worse for the Tories: they'd be pretty much wiped out. And when it comes to centre-Right parties around the globe, they are not alone.\n\nAcross the democratic world the centre-Right has either disappeared, almost without trace, or morphed into the Populist Right, junking what it long stood for in the process. In America, the Republican Party has been subject to a hostile takeover by Donald Trump and his MAGA movement.\n\nToday's Republican Party bears no resemblance to the party of Eisenhower in the 1950s. Indeed it has very little in common with the Republicans of Ronald Reagan three decades later which, itself, was a major makeover of what had gone before.\n\nIn France both the centre-Right and the Left are on life support.\n\nThe mainstream Right Republican Party, whose leaders have included De Gaulle, Pompidou and Chirac, played a seminal role in building modern France. But over the past decade, like the Socialist Party, it has haemorrhaged support.\n\nIn the 2017 parliamentary elections, the Republicans had won only 16 per cent of the vote, the Socialists 7 per cent – a combined 23 per cent of the vote, their worst ever.\n\nIn last year's parliamentary elections the Republicans crashed to under 7 per cent, on a par with the Socialists – a combined 14 per cent. A new worst ever.\n\nThe lesson from France is clear: however distinguished your history, however well you think you've run the country, however much you think you're in with the political woodwork, in today's politics you cannot take your survival for granted.\n\nAlmost everywhere you look, the mainstream Right has either been overwhelmed by the Populist Right or had to make fundamental accommodations with it.\n\nItaly's ruling Coalition is dominated by Prime Minister Meloni's Brothers Of Italy, a party with neo-fascist roots, and the hard-Right League party of Matteo Salvini. The mainstream Right in the shape of Forza Italia, created by Silvio Berlusconi, is in government – but very much the third junior partner – having won only 8 per cent of the vote – where it still languishes.\n\nEven in progressive Sweden, where the centre-Right Moderate Party leads a Coalition government, it does so only with the connivance of the far-Right Sweden Democrats, without which it does not have a majority.\n\nPerhaps the only major centre-Right success in Europe is Germany where the Christian Democrats led by Friedrich Merz are in power.\n\nBut they had to form a coalition with their old rival, the Social Democrats, who'd been in charge of a lacklustre government before this year's election, in which it managed to win only 16 per cent of the vote, its worst result ever.\n\nAnd perhaps the worst is yet to come for the mainstream Right. In Germany, the ruling Christian Democrats are being out-polled by the hard-Right AfD, now the main opposition party in the Bundestag.\n\nEarlier this month, a general election in the Czech Republic was won by a populist Right party led by a self-described 'Trumpist', swamping the centre-Right.\n\nThe ruling party of Japan, the Liberal Democrats, long a poster child for the centre-Right, has just chosen a Right-wing ethno-nationalist as its new leader.\n\nThe mainstream Right is out of kilter with the tenor of the times. In government, it often let conservatives down by not being very conservative. Now it's out of power it's rediscovering, in Australia and Britain, for example, the old-time religion.\n\nFiscal prudence, smaller government, lower taxes and its inevitable corollary, less state spending. But these are a tough sell in the current political climate.\n\nBill Clinton declared over 30 years that the Age of Big Government was over. But it's back with a vengeance. And not just when the Left is in power. For this is also an Age of Big Government Conservatism. Commentators tend to concentrate on the populist Right's social conservatism, its opposition to 'woke', its hostility to immigration. Not enough attention is given to its statist economics. It offers a heady brew of social conservatism and Left-wing interventionist economic policies. Electorally it is a potent combination, something the centre-Right struggles to match.\n\nMr Trump has no plan to reduce the national debt – it's currently 125 per cent of GDP and rising – and he remains unfazed by huge annual budget deficits – over 6 per cent of GDP – for as far as the eye can see.\n\nNo Thatcherite he.\n\nNigel Farage claims to be a Thatcherite. But he has agreed to a Reform prospectus which could have been written by the Labour Left – and have the Iron Lady turning in her grave.\n\nWelfare spending is out of control in Britain but Reform promises to increase it. It proposes public ownership of 'critical infrastructure'. It would nationalise companies it deems vital to national security.\n\nWhich brings us to the central psephological dilemma for the mainstream Right. Historically, the key to the Conservatives' success was always this: they won two-thirds to three quarters of the middle and upper-middle class votes and, crucially, around a third of the working class vote.\n\nBut today the middle and upper-middle classes increasingly votes Left, especially in metropolitan areas – and the working class and lower middle class increasingly vote Populist Right. Cue the shattering of the centre-Right's election-winning formula.\n\nThe urban bourgeoisie in particular has all but abandoned the centre-Right. Most major cities across the democratic world now skew Left, whereas before they were more evenly balanced. London, Paris, Berlin, Toronto, San Francisco, Melbourne – these days they are increasingly Left-wing fiefdoms.\n\nMargaret Thatcher, a London MP, did better in the capital than in England as a whole. Today only nine of London's 75 MPs are Conservative. New York, the epicentre of global capitalism, is about to elect a socialist mayor.\n\nMetropolitan conurbations are full of migrants, woke media/cultural elites, charities, university graduates, the lanyard classes, the myriad quasi-government bodies, domestic and international, that suck off the public teat. And, of course, millions of public sector workers, at municipal, state and federal levels.\n\nAll trend Left. All bow before the new gods of identity politics.\n\nHow the centre-Right can make a comeback in this increasingly hostile environment is a question to which a convincing answer has yet to be provided.\n\nBritish Labour, historically the party of the working class, is now least popular with those at the bottom of the social pile and most popular with those at the top.\n\nIf voting was confined to the two top social grades – those households with incomes of over £70,000 a year – Keir Starmer would be a shoo-in for a second term. As it is, he's heading for oblivion.\n\nThe Reform insurgents do best among the state-educated and non-graduates. Among voters as a whole, Reform is 13 points ahead of Labour. Among those privately educated, Reform is 13 points behind Labour.\n\nIn America, the psephological revolution is just as stark. In 1956, perhaps the high watermark of Country Club Republicanism, President Eisenhower beat his Democratic challenger, Adlai Stevenson, in 190 of America's 200 richest counties. The affluent voted overwhelmingly Republican. In the 2024 presidential election, Kamala Harris won 190 of America's 200 richest counties. The affluent, these days, vote overwhelmingly Democrat, even for a candidate as useless as Kamala Harris.\n\nSo why are the mainstream parties — especially the centre-Right – in such trouble?\n\nLet me tell you about the long tale of the Great Financial Crash of 2008, whose shadow cast a pall over the body politic long after the financial system had recovered – and still lingers today.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the crash – in 2009 and 2010 – we congratulated ourselves. Unlike the Wall Street Crash of 1929 the credit crunch of 2008 had not led to a decade-long Great Depression, which only really ended when America rearmed at scale to enter World War II.\n\nCentral Banks, especially the US Federal Reserve, learned from the mistakes of the 1930s when their response to the 1929 Crash was to tighten money – thereby making matters worse. This time they pumped money into the economy.\n\nIt was called quantitative easing – QE. And it worked. Banks did not go bust. Mass unemployment didn't stalk the land. The fall in GDP soon recovered.\n\nBut it came at a long-term price. The scale of the QE was massive. That avalanche of money had to go somewhere. It went into assets.\n\nSo if you already had assets – stocks, bonds, property – the good times were soon rocking and rolling again. The wealth of the asset-rich resumed its upward trajectory. But if you were living week to week on a wage or a fixed income, life was a precarious, perpetual struggle.\n\nIt began to dawn on those struggling to make ends meet that the people who had caused the Great Crash – the asset-rich classes – were doing better than ever. While those on a wage, who'd done nothing to cause the Crash, were being penalised. As if to compound the pain, the powers that be – the mainstream parties of the Right and Left – presided over an experiment in mass migration which depressed wages further. \n\nFor plain folk, globalisation began to seem like a penalty the centrist elites were inflicting on them. And, just in case these folk hadn't got the memo that they no longer mattered, these same centrist elites started to inflict Net Zero on them too. Big Government virtue signalling at its worst.\n\nIf you didn't like it, you had to lump it. The governing elites across the spectrum had decided this was the defining mission of the age – and they were sending the rest of us the tab. The ramifications of all this have been – still are – immense.\n\nWithout the failures of the mainstream parties I doubt Britain would have voted for Brexit in 2016 nor America for Donald Trump. Both were expressions of disgust with the status quo which ignored their concerns.\n\nSo on both sides of the Atlantic they jumped ship from a mainstream that had failed them and went Populist, with consequences that are still unfolding.\n\nThere can be no salvation for the centre-Right anywhere, until its leaders accept how much they've hurt and let down the people who once supported them.\n\nIf there is a way forward – and that matter is still moot – it almost certainly starts with an apology.\n\nThis is an edited version of a speech Andrew Neil gave in Brisbane last month at a conference organised by Australia's leading public-policy think tank, the Centre for Independent Studies","summary":"We live in a political age in which the 'unlikely' increasingly becomes the 'likely', with a rapidity similar to Hemingway's description of going bankrupt - gradually, then suddenly... very suddenly.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-15247489/populist-ANDREW-NEIL-plight-mainstream-Right.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/31/21/103496375-0-image-a-11_1761944484219.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 01:24:31","author":"Andrew Neil,Editor","authors":["Andrew Neil","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.218},{"id":374615100,"title":"Trump interview with CBS’ 60 Minutes to air this weekend for the first time since he sued over the program","text":"The CBS News program 60 Minutes will air an in-depth interview with President Donald Trump on Sunday, marking the first time he has appeared there since he launched and later settled a multi-million dollar lawsuit over one of the show’s reports featuring Kamala Harris. \n\nDuring the interview, which was recorded Friday, anchor Norah O’Donnell speaks with the president about China, Venezuela, Israel, the government shutdown, immigration, and his attempts to deploy the National Guard to cities around the country, according to CBS News.\n\nTrump sued CBS in October alleging 60 Minutes had deceptively edited an interview with his 2024 presidential election rival Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nThe network initially fought the suit, calling it “meritless,” but in July CBS and its parent company Paramount settled with Trump for $16 million. \n\nTrump’s dispute with the network had far-reaching political, economic, and journalistic ramifications.\n\nIn April, a top producer at 60 Minutes announced he was quitting, alleging the storied news show had lost its “journalistic independence.”\n\nStephen Colbert, host of CBS’s Late Show, criticized the eventual settlement as a “big fat bribe,” as part of his regular criticisms of Trump.

Trump was interviewed by CBS' Norah O'Donnell Friday at Mar-a-Lago for the appearance, which will air this Sunday. The president has an uneasy history with television's most popular newsmagazine. But he has signaled friendlier relations with CBS News after the takeover of its parent company this summer by new Paramount CEO David Ellison, the son of wealthy supporter Larry Ellison. CBS News offered few details Friday on how the interview came together, or whether there were any ground rules put in place. O'Donnell, the former “CBS Evening News” anchor, is not one of the show's regular correspondents. Trump walked out of a “60 Minutes” interview with correspondent Lesley Stahl shortly before the 2020 election, complaining of bias, and his team released an unedited transcript of the conversation. Despite invitations, he did not agree to a “60 Minutes” interview during the 2024 election campaign. But he complained that the newsmagazine's interview with Harris, his Democratic opponent, was edited deceptively in order to make her look good. CBS News strongly denied any wrongdoing, but Trump filed a lawsuit against the company. Paramount decided to pay Trump $16 million to settle the case this summer, shortly before the Federal Communications Commission approved Paramount's merger with Ellison's Skydance Media. In the wake of the Trump lawsuit, “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens resigned this past spring, saying that it was becoming clear that he could no longer run the program independently. Since taking over at Paramount, Ellison has sent signals of a closer relationship with Trump. He hired Kenneth Weinstein , the former head of a conservative think tank and a donor to Trump's 2024 campaign, to serve in a role investigating complaints that the network had shown bias in its reporting. Paramount also purchased the Free Press website in October and named its founder, Bari Weiss, as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News. Weiss reportedly had a role in booking the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and aide Steve Witkoff for a “60 Minutes” interview two weeks ago, talking about the peace deal in Gaza. Flying back from the Middle East on Oct. 12, Trump told reporters that “Larry Ellison is great, and his son David is great. They're friends of mine. They're big supporters of mine, and they'll do the right thing.”","summary":"The president has an uneasy history with television's most popular newsmagazine.","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/trump-returns-to-60-minutes-after-lawsuit-settlement-1914041","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/11/01/1973425-aa-5854143.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 00:57:41","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":374612514,"title":"The Latest: Trump administration must fund SNAP payments during the shutdown, judges rule","text":"Two federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration must continue to fund SNAP, the nation’s biggest food aid program, using contingency funds during the government shutdown.\n\nThe rulings came a day before the U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown.\n\nThe program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation’s social safety net. Word in October that it would be a Nov. 1 casualty of the shutdown sent states, food banks and SNAP recipients scrambling to figure out how to secure food. Some states said they would spend their own funds to keep versions of the program going.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling. That process often takes one to two weeks.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\n Air traffic controller shortages lead to broader US flight delays as shutdown nears 1-month mark \n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration reported staffing shortages that were causing flight delays Friday at a number of airports, including in Boston, Phoenix, San Francisco, Nashville, Houston, Dallas and the Washington, D.C., area. Airports serving the New York City area — John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty — were also experiencing delays averaging around two hours, according to the FAA.\n\nStaffing shortages can occur both in regional control centers that manage multiple airports and in individual airport towers, but they don’t always lead to flight disruptions. According to aviation analytics firm Cirium, flight data showed strong on-time performance at most major airports for the month of October despite isolated staffing problems throughout the month.\n\nBut Cirium said the data also showed a “broader slowdown” Thursday across the nation’s aviation system for the first time since the shutdown began Oct. 1, suggesting staffing-related disruptions may be spreading.\n\n▶ Read more about the shutdown and U.S. aviation\n\n Instacart, DoorDash, Gopuff among companies offering discounts to SNAP recipients \n\nInstacart said Friday that it will offer customers who receive SNAP benefits 50% on their next grocery order to ease strain as the government prepares to cut off food aid payments.\n\nthe company said any customer who placed an order in October using a SNAP/EBT card will be eligible for the discount, which will be available even if the government makes payments as planned on Nov. 1. Instacart said it is also expanding the number of food banks it supports through online food drives from 100 to 300.\n\nThe San Francisco-based grocery delivery company said both programs amount to $5 million in direct relief.\n\nInstacart is one of several big companies reacting to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plan to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program on Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown.\n\n▶ Read more about companies offering discounts to SNAP recipients\n\n Trump back on ’60 Minutes’ for the first time after settling lawsuit \n\nThe president is returning to the weekly newsmagazine this weekend for the first time since the suit, which centered on its interview with Kamala Harris, was settled in the summer.\n\nTrump was interviewed by CBS’ Norah O’Donnell on Friday at Mar-a-Lago for the appearance, which will air Sunday.\n\nThe president has a checkered history with television’s most popular newsmagazine. But he has signaled friendlier relations with CBS News after the takeover of its parent company this summer by new Paramount CEO David Ellison, the son of wealthy supporter Larry Ellison.\n\n Trump says he’ll fund SNAP if the courts give more clarity \n\nThe president suggested on social media that the government would comply with court rulings to pay for food aid during the government shutdown but said more clarity is needed first.\n\n“Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump said. Federal funds for the program are expected to be frozen starting Saturday.\n\n“If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding.”\n\nHe sought to blame Democrats for the delay and urged SNAP recipients to call Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n New Pentagon policy undercuts trans troops’ ability to ask to stay in the military, AP learns \n\nThe policy will severely undercut the ability of transgender troops who have been banned from the armed forces by the Trump administration to turn to peer boards to argue for their right to stay, according to a memo obtained by AP.\n\nIf military separation boards decide to allow transgender service members to remain in uniform, commanders can override those decisions, according to an Oct. 8 memo to all services from the Pentagon’s undersecretary for personnel and readiness. That breaks with longstanding policy that boards act independently.\n\nIt is the Pentagon’s latest step to drive transgender troops out of the armed forces following a presidential executive order. Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have targeted diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in what they say is an effort to make the military more lethal.\n\nThe new memo also requires that trans service members appear before separation boards in uniforms that match the gender assigned to them at birth. If they do not, their absence can be used against them.\n\n▶ Read more about the policy\n\n Court says Border Patrol official won’t have to brief judge on Chicago-area immigration sweeps \n\nAn appeals court ruled in favor of the Trump administration and stopped a judge from trying to get daily updates from a Border Patrol official about the government’s immigration crackdown in the Chicago area.\n\nThe court said the order from U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis put her “in position of an inquisitor rather than that of a neutral adjudicator” and would have turned her into a supervisor of Greg Bovino, a violation of the separation of powers.\n\nEllis, concerned about allegations of excessive force and the use of tear gas against protesters, wanted daily updates from Bovino, starting Wednesday. But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals intervened that day and suspended the order, before going further and freezing it Friday.\n\nAlso Friday, advocates in a different case sued over what they called “inhumane” conditions at a Chicago-area immigration facility.\n\n Senate Democrats urge top Trump national security officials to brief lawmakers on Venezuela strikes \n\nThe renewed request came in a letter Friday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.\n\n“We also request that you provide all legal opinions related to these strikes and a list of the groups or other entities the President has deemed targetable,” the senators said in the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nSignatories included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as Jack Reed, Jeanne Shaheen, Mark Warner, Chris Coons, Patty Murray and Brian Schatz.\n\nThe letter said the administration so far “has selectively shared what has at times been contradictory information” with some members “while excluding others.”\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans have complained that the administration has failed to provide basic information about lethal strikes that U.S. forces have carried out against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and Pacific the last two months.\n\n Trump opens the door for sanctions on Nigeria over alleged persecution of Christians \n\nThe president announced Friday that he would designate the West African nation “a country of particular concern” as it relates to religious freedom, a move that has been pushed by some U.S. lawmakers.\n\nThe designation does not necessarily mean that sanctions, which could include a ban on all non-humanitarian aid, will be imposed, but it is a step ahead of that.\n\n“Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria,” Trump said via social media. “Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter. I am hereby making Nigeria a ‘COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR CONCERN.’”\n\nNigeria vehemently rejects such claims about persecution of Christians. Analysts say that while Christians are among those targeted, the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria’s Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.\n\nTrump said he would ask lawmakers to look into the matter and report back on what the response to the designation should be.\n\n Union president for air traffic controllers says ‘end this shutdown’ \n\nThe president of the union representing air traffic controllers is calling on Congress to pass a clean continuing resolution to end the government shutdown, make sure federal workers get paid and then engage in bipartisan negotiation on other pressing issues.\n\nNick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said the workers the union represents got no paycheck on Tuesday after receiving a partial check two weeks earlier. He said going without a full month’s pay or more would be unsustainable.\n\nDaniels also said the situation is creating substantial distractions for individuals already engaged in extremely stressful work.\n\n“The financial and mental strain increases risks within the National Airspace System, making it less safe with each passing day of the shutdown,” Daniels said in a statement.\n\n Top Senate Judiciary Democrat challenges YouTube’s claims of Biden censorship \n\nAttorneys for YouTube’s parent company Alphabet last month sent the Senate Judiciary Committee a letter claiming the Biden administration pressed the social media site to delete content during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBut Sen. Jamie Raskin, the committee’s Democratic ranking member, on Friday publicly questioned that assessment in his own letter to YouTube CEO Neal Mohan.\n\nRaskin wrote that the sworn testimony of 20 Alphabet employees contradicted the claims the company had made. He questioned whether YouTube was coerced to claim censorship by the Trump administration.\n\n“What was Alphabet promised or threatened with in order to dance to this new MAGA tune?” Raskin asked in Friday’s letter.\n\nRepublicans argue the Biden administration illegally censored Americans through coercion to tech companies. Democrats dispute that narrative.\n\n Judge sides with Democratic groups that sued over Trump’s proof-of-citizenship directive \n\nThe federal judge ruled that Trump’s request to add a documentary proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers.\n\nThe ruling deals a blow to the administration and its allies who have argued that such a mandate is necessary to restore public confidence that only Americans are voting in U.S. elections.\n\n“Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes,” U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, D.C., wrote in her opinion.\n\nKollar-Kotelly echoed comments she made when she granted a preliminary injunction over the issue.\n\n Senators press Hegseth for more information on boat strikes \n\nThe Republican chair and ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee have asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to provide the legal rationale for the U.S. military’s fatal attacks on alleged drug boats off the South American coast.\n\nThe senators also requested the directives Hegseth approved for the military strikes, which have killed at least 61 people in 14 attacks since early September. They also want the list of drug cartels that the Trump administration has designated as terrorist organizations in its justification for the use of military force.\n\nThe requests were made in two letters from late September and early October that were released Friday by Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, and Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island.\n\nLawmakers in both parties have raised questions about the use of military force without congressional approval. The Trump administration has shown no evidence to support its claims about the boats that have been attacked, their connection to drug cartels, or even the identity of the people killed in the strikes.\n\n Top Democrat says Trump administration must release SNAP funds after judge’s ruling \n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture committee that oversees the food aid program, said the court’s decision “confirms what we have said all week: The administration is choosing not to feed Americans in need, despite knowing that it is legally required to do so.”\n\nThe district court’s decision leaves “no excuse to withhold food assistance from Americans,” she said.\n\nIf the administration decides not to issue SNAP funds, she said, “it is purely a cruel political decision, not a legal one. They should immediately act — as the court has required — to ensure food assistance continues to go to families in need.”\n\n Judges in the SNAP payment lawsuits expect updates by Monday \n\nA federal judge in Rhode Island ruled from the bench that the program must be funded using at least the contingency funds — and asked for an update on progress by Monday.\n\nA Massachusetts-based judge also gave the administration until Monday to say whether it would partially pay for the benefits for November with contingency money or fund them fully with additional funds.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling.\n\nThat process often takes one to two weeks.\n\nThe rulings are likely to face appeals.\n\n Senate Republicans reject Trump’s call to eliminate the filibuster \n\nTrump has long pushed Senate Republicans to get rid of the rule that requires 60 votes to overcome objections and gives the minority Democrats a check on GOP power. He posted on social media late Thursday that the Senate should “Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!”\n\nBut Senate Majority Leader John Thune has repeatedly said he is not considering changing the rules even as he seeks to end the shutdown, arguing that the filibuster is vital to the institution of the Senate and has allowed them to halt Democratic policies when they are in the minority.\n\nThe leader’s “position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged,” Thune spokesman Ryan Wrasse said Friday.\n\nA spokeswoman for Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Republican, said his position opposing a filibuster change also remains unchanged.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also defended the filibuster Friday, while conceding “it’s not my call.”\n\n“The safeguard in the Senate has always been the filibuster,” Johnson said, adding that Trump’s comments are “the president’s anger at the situation.”\n\n Trump administration must fund SNAP payments during the shutdown, judge rules \n\nTwo federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration must to continue to fund SNAP, the nation’s biggest food aid program, using contingency funds during the government shutdown.\n\nThe rulings came a day before the U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown.\n\nThe program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation’s social safety net. Word in October that it would be a Nov. 1 casualty of the shutdown sent states, food banks and SNAP recipients scrambling to figure out how to secure food. Some states said they would spend their own funds to keep versions of the program going.\n\nThe program costs around $8 billion per month nationally.\n\n Trump says he’s renovated the Lincoln Bathroom \n\nThe president announced the renovation and posted side-by-side photos of the before and after of the rehab of the bathroom attached to one of the most famous rooms in the White House.\n\n“It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,” Trump added. “I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”\n\n White House set to resume public tours in December, after interruption for ballroom construction \n\nThe White House says tours will restart Dec. 2, following their suspension for months due to the construction of Trump’s $300 million ballroom.\n\nThe East Wing was once part of tour routes, but has been demolished as part of the project.\n\nThe White House says it’ll now offer “an updated route offering guests the opportunity to experience the history and beauty of the People’s House.”\n\nTo mark the holidays, December tours feature Christmas decorations curated by first lady Melania Trump on the State Floor.\n\nCongressional offices can begin submitting tour requests for their constituents on Monday. Such requests had been paused since the summer for ballroom construction.\n\n Heritage Foundation head defends Tucker Carlson for hosting white nationalist with antisemitic views \n\nThe president of the Heritage Foundation, a prominent Republican-aligned think tank, defended conservative media personality Tucker Carlson after he offered a platform to a far-right activist known for pushing white nationalist and antisemitic views.\n\nHeritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts posted a video to social media Thursday in which he denied that the group was “distancing itself” from the former Fox News host after Carlson’s podcast hosted Nick Fuentes, whose followers see themselves as trying to preserve America’s white, Christian identity.\n\nRoberts’ video drew sharp rebukes from some prominent Jewish leaders from both parties.\n\nCarlson, one of the most powerful voices on the right, has been critical of the U.S.’s support for Israel in its war with Hamas and has come under fire for his own far-right views, including the white-supremacist theory that says whites are being “replaced” by people of color.\n\n▶ Read more about Carlson and the Heritage Foundation\n\n Trump won’t clarify if the US will conduct tests of its nuclear weapons \n\nThe president was asked if his social media post this week about nuclear tests meant that the U.S. would resume testing its nuclear weapons in underground detonation tests, which it has not done since 1992. He replied: “You’ll find out very soon,” without elaborating.\n\nTrump said, “We’re going to do some testing” and “Other countries do it. If they’re going to do it, we’re going to.” But he then refused to offer more details.\n\nTrump’s comments on nuclear testing have drawn confusion inside and outside the government when the president seemed to suggest on social media that the U.S. would resume nuclear warhead tests for the first time in three decades on an “equal basis” with Russia and China, whose last known tests were in the 1990s.","summary":"Federal judges have ruled that the Trump administration must continue funding SNAP during the government shutdown","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-snap-federal-aviation-administration-tucker-carlson-senate-b2856485.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/01/00/Trump_16556.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 00:41:49","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.32},{"id":374611246,"title":"Democrats are screaming about the impact of THEIR government shutdown","text":"As Democrats drag the government shutdown on, they’re suddenly caterwauling about one thing they knew for sure their recalcitrance would cause: 40 million Americans on SNAP — food stamps — facing a benefits cliff.\n\nThey’ve even repurposed the “starving babies” meme, from Gaza to this standoff. “Donald Trump . . . thinks starving people help him politically!” shrieks Rep.

Mikie Sherrill, the Democrat nominee.\n\nWhile New Jersey is a traditionally blue state where Democrats hold a significant registration advantage, recent polls show the candidates are neck and neck.\n\nThe Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor, Mikie Sherrill, addresses a campaign event in Westville, New Jersey, on Oct. 11. (Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images)\n\nBeginning in June, New Jersey residents experienced a 20% increase in electricity prices that figures into broader concerns about affordability throughout the state. Ciattarelli affixes the blame for the spike in utility bills on policies Murphy has implemented in Trenton and Sherrill has pursued in Washington.\n\nThe candidates have staked out vastly different approaches on energy policy.\n\nCiattarelli has pledged to withdraw New Jersey from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multistate carbon tax plan known as “RGGI” (and pronounced as “Reggie”) built around “cap and trade” regulations.\n\nUnder Murphy, New Jersey rejoined RGGI in 2021 after his predecessor, Republican Gov. Chris Christie, pulled the state out of it.\n\nIn addition to delivering regulatory relief, Ciattarelli is also looking to reopen power plants Murphy shut down—and potentially open new ones. The Republican has also expressed support for expanding nuclear power.\n\nFor her part, Sherrill has not specifically endorsed RGGI, but she has expressed support for green energy policies in line with RGGI’s goals. Sherrill has pledged to declare a “state of emergency” on utility costs and freeze utility rates.\n\nSherrill, who has represented the state’s 11th Congressional District since 2019, also supports Murphy’s plan to make New Jersey a 100% clean energy state by 2035.\n\nCiattarelli has spent part of his campaign working to tie Sherrill in with Murphy, who has a minus-9 point negative approval rating in the state, while Sherrill has attempted to weigh her Republican opponent down with voter antagonism toward President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Kenny Stein, vice president of policy for the Institute of Energy Research, told The Daily Signal that the decisive factor could be voter fatigue with green energy mandates that have created upward pressure on energy prices.\n\nSherrill and other Democrats have been critical of Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” claiming that removal of subsidies is responsible for the recent spike in energy prices.\n\nStein disputes that reasoning.\n\n“One big problem with this argument is that it will be several years before these subsidies expire,” he explained. “The One Big, Beautiful Bill ends the Production Tax Credit and the Investment Tax Credit for wind and solar facilities placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027, and for those facilities where construction did not begin before July 4, 2026.\n\n“Let’s also not forget there is a carveout for projects that begin construction over the next year or so that could then be eligible for subsidies starting as late as 2030. What’s really key here is what’s happening at the state level and what kind of regulations are going in place locally,” he said, adding: “New Jersey could serve as a test bed for where voters fix the blame for rising costs.”\n\nProperty Taxes, Education\n\nNew Jersey has the highest property taxes in the nation, with the average homeowner’s bill now hovering around $10,000 a year. Since the state’s public schools are heavily reliant on property taxes, any discussion of tax reform almost always intersects with education policy.\n\nCiattarelli views the current school funding formula as unconstitutional. He argues that it violates the equal benefit provisions of the state constitution.\n\nHe has committed himself to setting “a statewide standard on per-pupil spending” and then allowing “that money to follow the student,” according to his campaign website. He also supports various school choice initiatives, including the expanded use of charter schools.\n\nCiattarelli views Florida’s school choice voucher program as a model for what could be done in New Jersey.\n\nSherrill’s “Affordability Agenda” includes a mix of tax credits and rebates. Her education plan revolves around a transparency initiative she describes as “The New Jersey Report Card” that includes an online portal that points to state-funded payments, contracts, and programs.\n\nSherrill does not support private school choice initiatives, such as vouchers, but has expressed some support for charter schools.\n\nRecent figures show Democrats have a roughly 896,350 voter registration advantage over Republicans, but that figure is down from more than 1 million just a few years ago.\n\nMoreover, Trump made significant gains in the state during his 2024 run and came within 6 points of upsetting then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Then there’s Ciattarelli himself, who finished only about 3 points behind Murphy when the governor’s race was finally called in 2021.\n\nThere’s a historical precedent for tax revolts upending gubernatorial races in New Jersey. Then-Democrat Gov. Jim Florio lost his bid for reelection in 1993 after pushing through a record $2.8 billion tax hike.\n\nRichard LaRossa remembers those days. He is a former New Jersey Republican state senator who represented parts of Mercer County. His surprise victory in the wake of the tax revolts gave Republicans a veto-proof majority in the legislature. LaRossa sees a similar dynamic at work today Ciattarelli is attracting support from independents and Democrats.\n\n“No matter what the party affiliation, it’s hard to not realize how far to the left Democrats have gone and that there are dozens of Democrats who are either changing parties or supporting Jack Ciattarelli,” he said.\n\nCiattarelli has been endorsed by a number of prominent New Jersey Democrats, including mayors.\n\nLaRossa also cites some sobering figures he thinks could help move the needle for Republicans.\n\n“It took 238 years for [New Jersey’s] budget to reach $32 billion,” he said. “But it only took only seven years to reach $57 billion, a 75% increase. It’s simple, no one in New Jersey can afford Democrats any longer. We need fiscal restraint and fiscal accountability. That will only happen with Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey’s governor’s office.”\n\nState figures point to a sizable number of unaffiliated voters in New Jersey. In fact, unaffiliated voters may be the largest bloc of voters, even outnumbering Democrats. Whichever candidate wins over the unaffiliated will most likely win the election.\n\nIn-person early voting in New Jersey began on Oct. 25 for the Nov. 4 election.","summary":"Rising energy prices and record-high property taxes are among the top issues driving voters to the polls in a close, competitive gubernatorial election set for...

Mikie Sherrill.\n\nCiattarelli was largely preaching to the choir on the chilly night as the audience, which included some MAGA-hat wearers, was overwhelmingly Republican.\n\nTrump has loomed large over the race and has been one of Sherrill’s great sources of ammunition against Ciattarelli, marking a contrast from the Republican hopeful’s failed gubernatorial run four years ago, when Trump had somewhat faded into the background after his 2020 election loss. Ciattarelli lost his 2021 race by about 3 percentage points.\n\nNow Ciattarelli is forced to walk a fine line of not alienating Trump’s fervent supporters, who he needs to win, while simultaneously refraining from embracing him too much and scaring off moderates, who are also paramount to his success.\n\n“If Trump wasn’t in the White House, Ciattarelli would be up by 12 points,” Sherrill’s former Democratic primary foe, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, observed to reporter David Cruz on his “Hold That Thought …” podcast earlier this month.\n\nLast year, Trump had spooked Democrats by impressively finishing about 6 percentage points behind former Vice President Kamala Harris in traditionally blue New Jersey, dramatically closer than his roughly 16-point loss there in 2020.\n\nBut the president is still underwater with current New Jersey voters, with a 40% approval to 56% disapproval rating, while Dem Gov. Phil Murphy is hovering at a 45% approval to 47% disapproval rating, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll.\n\nDuring their final debate in early October, Ciattarelli and Sherrill were given the thorny question of grading Trump and Murphy, the men whom the two candidates have used as boogeymen against each other. \n\nCiattarelli gave Trump a glowing “A,” while Sherrill carefully gave Murphy a “B.”\n\n“That’s a difficult question for Ciattarelli, because he’s got to say A because he doesn’t want to upset Donald Trump. But Donald Trump is not popular in New Jersey,” said Dan Cassino, a politics professor and executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll, to The Post at the time.\n\n“He really does have to kind of try to obfuscate and try and talk around that, and that’s tough for him.”\n\nCiattarelli has repeatedly been forced to navigate some of Trump’s policies that are unpopular locally, such as his deployment of the National Guard in numerous cities across the country and the scrapping of federal funding for the local Gateway Tunnel project, the latter of which the GOP hopeful has publicly opposed.\n\nWhile Sherrill has campaigned or made plans to stump with her party’s top political stars, such as ex-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), and, on Saturday, former President Barack Obama, Ciattarelli has not had an in-person rally with Trump in the homestretch.\n\nInstead, he did a telerally with Trump last week. Trump has also blasted out Truth Social posts urging his supporters to back Ciattarelli.\n\nCiattarelli, when pressed by The Post whether Trump was hurting him at all, insisted, “Not one bit.\n\n“And by the way, he improved by over 10 points in New Jersey ’20 compared to ’24. And he’s done some really good things for New Jersey,” the Republican candidate said.\n\nCiattarelli pointed to Trump’s fight against New York’s congestion pricing and signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to increase the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap as examples of positive moves for New Jersey.\n\n“The motivating factor here is the failure of the current administration,” Ciattarelli stressed, referring to Murphy. “It’s been a failure across the board.”\n\nBackers of Ciattarelli agree. \n\n“The president doesn’t have a lot of effect on the state of New Jersey,” said voter Bill Montanaro of Spring Lake.\n\n“In New Jersey, in all honesty, I’m tired of the carpetbagger governors we’ve had,” he said. “We had [Jon] Corzine from Illinois. We got this hack from Massachusetts, Murphy, who’s an idiot. \n\nAnd now we got another carpetbagger from Virginia,” he said of Sherrill, who was born in the Old Dominion state.\n\nGerald Murphy, 62, from Essex County, who has been to at least 15 Ciattarelli events, said the efforts to bring Trump into the New Jersey governor’s race are tiring. \n\n“[They’re] trying to blame Donald Trump,” he said. “No, take Donald Trump out of the picture. What have the Democrats here in New Jersey done for people?\n\n“They give the black community a hamburger, hot dog, chicken. ‘And I’ll see you in four years for your vote again.’ Enough is enough,” said Murphy, who is black.\n\nHe had been a registered Democrat for over two decades before switching to the GOP last year.","summary":"President Trump has loomed large over the New Jersey governor's race and has been one of candidate and Dem Rep.

This transformation highlights a broader trend where affluent communities have increasingly aligned with Democrats, while working-class individuals have gravitated towards the Republican Party. This shift has resulted in Democrats experiencing advantages beyond mere economic prosperity, including longer life expectancies and reduced risks of death from gun violence or opioid overdoses, when compared to other regions.\n\nThe report, titled “Class Dismissed II: The Secession of the Successful,” was crafted by CGCN, a GOP lobbying and public affairs firm. Released exclusively to a major news outlet before its public debut, the report delves into the data reflecting the realignment of voter coalitions, particularly during President Donald Trump’s campaigns. The authors of the report echo sentiments expressed by former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who, during the Clinton administration, described a phenomenon he referred to as “the secession of the successful”—a trend where the nation’s elite distanced themselves from the broader societal concerns.\n\n“It’s not often we find ourselves in agreement with President Clinton’s former Labor Secretary, Robert Reich. Yet, back in the 1990s, Reich identified an emerging social trend he termed ‘the secession of the successful,'” the CGCN report notes. “By this, he meant the elite withdrawing from the everyday issues facing most people.” This new report builds on CGCN’s previous findings from late 2023, offering fresh insights into this ongoing social shift.\n\n“Our updated census data analysis, following our earlier memo ‘Class Dismissed I,’ confirms Reich’s observations as a solid reality, albeit in ways he might not have imagined,” the report states. “The successful class—defined by income, education, geography, and cultural homogeneity—is increasingly gravitating towards the Democratic Party, moving away from Republicans. This ‘secession’ signifies a move into an insular, elite cultural sphere, detached from the working-class and poorer populations, who face the country’s most severe social challenges. Recent data from CGCN highlights that these social and economic issues are more prevalent in Republican districts than Democratic ones.”\n\nThis report is part of a growing body of literature attempting to dissect the challenges facing Democrats, including their perceived detachment from broader society. Another recent analysis, highlighted by journalist Dave Weigel of Semafor, cautions Democrats against further electoral losses and geographical isolation unless they address the extremism tied to their affluent base. While numerous reports have surfaced, this latest offering from CGCN illustrates the increasing wealth and elitism associated with the Democratic Party.\n\nThe new CGCN report continues by arguing that this is a “party realignment decades in the making,” and that the two parties look much different than they did even a decade earlier.\n\n“The GOP is no longer dominated by Izod-wearing denizens of the Shaker Heights Country Club, and the Democrats are no longer the party of working-class locals in Youngstown’s Royal Oaks Bar and Grill,” the CGCN authors wrote, pointing specifically to the curious case of former Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), who spent his entire decades-long career as an elected Democrat portraying himself as a working-class champion only to get absolutely smoked by now-Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH) at the ballot box last year. Now, Brown is trying to run again, this time against newly-appointed GOP Sen. Jon Husted (R-OH) — who was picked to fill the spot vacated by now Vice President JD Vance — but is seriously failing to gain traction with the very working-class voters with whom he used to connect. The authors point to what they say are “earth shattering” changes in endorsements, where labor unions across Ohio are now backing Husted instead of Brown’s flailing comeback bid.\n\n“In short, anyone familiar with his decades-long career would know that unionism is in Brown’s DNA,” the CGCN authors wrote. “But in a sign of the times, his opponent, incumbent Sen. Jon Husted (R-OH), just inked substantial endorsements from Ohio’s industrial labor unions, including the International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE) Local 18 and 66, ‘giving the incumbent support from affiliated unions in all of Ohio’s 88 counties,’ according to Axios. On top of this, in September, the Northwest Ohio Building Trades Council flipped its support from Brown to Husted. This is, in short, earth shattering.”\n\nThe report then quotes a local labor leader explaining why the unions are endorsing the Republican Husted over the Democrat Brown.\n\n“The Mahoning Valley is the backbone of Ohio’s working class,” Jesse DiRenna, business manager for IUOE Local 66, said. “Sen. Jon Husted leads with action not just photo ops. His values align with ours, which is why we support him.”\n\nThe next two pages of the 13-page report have some of the most interesting data unearthed by the CGCN analysts, particularly the economic conditions in Democrat versus Republican strongholds in this era versus previous eras. First off, the report analyzes the share of annual gross domestic product (GDP) of the areas that voted for Trump the last three presidential elections versus the areas that voted for Democrat presidential nominees Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris.\n\n“Consider that Democrats, in fact, represent far wealthier districts and constituents than the GOP,” the report reads. “For example, over the last three presidential election cycles, Democratic candidates won counties with a higher share of aggregate GDP than Donald Trump.”\n\nAstoundingly, just during Trump’s time atop the Republican Party the past decade, this existing trend has grown far more profound. In 2016, the counties that Trump won nationwide amounted to 36 percent of aggregate GDP and the counties that Clinton won represented 64 percent of aggregate GDP. During the 2020 election, Trump’s counties represented 29 percent of aggregate GDP while Biden’s represented 71 percent. In 2024, Trump counties represented 37 percent of aggregate GDP while Harris-won counties represented 63 percent of aggregate GDP.\n\nIt’s even harder core when looking at the wealth among congressional districts and which parties hold seats in the richest parts of America. In fact, the report citing U.S. Census data found that Democrats currently hold more than three quarters — more than 76 percent — of the top 30 wealthiest congressional districts in America.\n\n“According to U.S. Census data, America’s wealthiest districts are overwhelmingly represented by Democrats,” the report reads. “Of the 30 richest congressional districts, only 7 are represented by Republicans, while 23 are represented by Democrats. By contrast, representation among the 30 poorest districts is more evenly split — Democrats represent 18, and Republicans represent 12.”\n\nMany of the most powerful Democrats, like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Reps. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), Eric Swalwell (D-CA), Ted Lieu (D-CA), Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), Ro Khanna (D-CA), and Jerry Nadler (D-NY) represent some of the “wealthiest districts” in the nation, and these names are also “some of the most familiar on cable news.”\n\n“The political and moral burden of representing poor and forgotten Americas now lies with the GOP,” the report continues. “Moreover, the stark divide between the everyday experience of one living in a poor congressional district as compared to a wealthy one explains in good measure why the two parties speak different languages.”\n\nLooking at the income data in the 30 wealthiest districts — again, now mostly Democrats — versus the 30 poorest districts, which are much more evenly split, the difference is profound. The median income in the richest districts per the CGCN report is $133,071, more than double the poorest district median income, which is $52,318. Unemployment is significantly worse in the poorer districts too, at 5.89 percent on average versus just 3.93 percent on average in the wealthy districts that Democrats dominate.\n\nBeyond the economic numbers, several social statistics also demonstrate a much higher quality of life for the very rich Democrats in America.\n\n“Opioid deaths are far more common in the poorest areas,” the CGCN report reads. “There are 19.6233 opioid deaths per 100,000 in the wealthiest districts. This number is even higher in the poorest districts. It jumps to 32.466 opioid deaths per 100,000 in the poorest districts. Firearm homicides are also far more common in the poorest districts. There are 13.39 firearm homicides per 100,000 people in the poorest districts. This number is 3.2 per 100,000 for the wealthiest districts. The poorest districts are trailing in high school completion. The average for the top 30 wealthiest districts is 92.93% with the number dropping to 84.66% for the poorest districts. The poorest districts have a lower life expectancy by about five years. The average life expectancy for the top 30 wealthiest districts is 81.333 years. For the poorest districts it falls to 75.82.”\n\nWhat’s more, Democrats in the House and Senate have become more elitist — and Republicans in both chambers less so — over the last several decades when it comes to education levels.\n\n“In the 93rd Congress (1973-75), 55% of Senate Republicans went to elite universities. In the 117th Congress (2021-2023), that number declined to 34%,” the report reads on a later page. “House Republicans educated from elite universities plummeted from 40% in the 93rd Congress to just 15% in the 117th. In the 117th Congress, over 50% of Democratic Senators had degrees from elite institutions. House Democrats who graduated from Harvard rose from 9% (93rd Congress) to 15% (117th Congress). Democratic senators from Yale University rose from 5% (93rd Congress) to 6% (117th Congress).”\n\nInterestingly, too, the report also found that the vast majority of members of the establishment media are rich, elitist, and white — meaning they have an inherent bias that misses the concerns of working-class Americans, who again are more and more becoming Republicans.\n\n“And whether consciously or not, most reporters strain to understand worlds completely foreign to them,” the CGCN report reads. “Here we mean rural areas and low-income neighborhoods, marred by crime, opioid deaths, and chronic unemployment, with populations who are religious, without college degrees, and overwhelmingly black and Hispanic. Hence, it’s not difficult to see the result: media bias. As conventionally understood, such bias also stems from a well-documented fact — reporters identify far more as Democrats than Republicans. A 2022 study by Syracuse University’s Newhouse School found that 36.3% of journalists identified as Democrats, while only 3.4% identified as Republicans. But in a similar context, the lack of newsroom diversity can also bias coverage.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON — Life is looking up for the Democratic Party, notably among&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: New Study Highlights Democrats&#8217; Emergence as the Party of Affluence first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/new-study-highlights-democrats-emergence-as-the-party-of-affluence/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Analysis-Reveals-How-Democrats-Are-Now-Party-of-the-Rich.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-31 22:00:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.018},{"id":374589232,"title":"Greg Gutfeld: The White House needed a serious cleaning","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nThe Five October 31, 2025 10:17 \n\n Greg Gutfeld: The White House needed a serious cleaning \n 'The Five' discusses President Donald Trump asking Republicans to ax the filibuster to end the government shutdown as former Vice President Kamala Harris drops f-bombs over the White House ballroom.\n Tags POLITICSSHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRTHE FIVEV-VIDEODONALD TRUMPKAMALA HARRISMEDIAWHITE HOUSEGOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNREPUBLICANS","summary":"&apos;The Five&apos; discusses President Donald Trump asking Republicans to ax the filibuster to end the government shutdown as former Vice President Kamala Harris drops f-bombs over the White House ballroom.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6384371314112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/01a5064c-9411-4c4c-a1e1-d6a09e4b917b/6b485e40-ed5b-4e99-b613-598e7721c2f7/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-31 21:50:32","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.401},{"id":374594252,"title":"Jack Ciattarelli confident he’ll ‘deliver a win’ as he votes early in New Jersey election","text":"“As I always like to say, what do championship teams do? We got four days left, let’s finish strong, let’s win, and let’s change the direction of Jersey,” Ciattarelli told his supporters.\n\n“We got two more days of early voting,” he added, quipping that “if you come across anyone you know that’s not voting for me, tell them that Election Day’s Wednesday, Nov. 5.”\n\nCiattarelli is facing Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) in the gubernatorial race, the most competitive of the two taking place on Tuesday. Though Sherrill has held a sizable lead in the historically blue state since she and Ciattarelli won their respective primaries in June, the state has begun to trend to the right and has a track record of periodically electing Republicans.\n\nAn Emerson College poll this week found that Ciattarelli and Sherrill are in a statistical dead heat, giving Sherrill a RealClearPolitics average of a 3.6-point lead. Ciattarelli said he was not shocked by the survey’s results, which put Sherrill at 49% of the vote to his 48%.\n\n“I get up and down the state every day of the week, and it’s confirming what I feel that’s out there,” Ciattarelli said outside the early voting location. “But we’re not done. We’ll finish strong over these last four days, and I really do believe that we’re going to deliver a win for New Jersey on Tuesday.”\n\nCiattarelli hopeful a changing ‘landscape’ will push him to victory\n\nCiattarelli is looking for a comeback this year, hoping the third time’s the charm.\n\nHe lost to former Gov. Chris Christie’s lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, in the 2017 GOP primary race. Then, in 2021, Gov. Phil Murphy (D-NJ) defeated Ciattarelli by roughly 3 percentage points — becoming the first Democratic governor reelected since 1977.\n\nHe said the landscape of New Jersey has changed, which is why he is more confident in a 2025 win than he was in 2021.\n\n“The issues I was talking about in ‘21 were percolating. Today they’re at a complete boil,” he said, pointing to the high cost of living and affordability crises the Garden State is facing.\n\nHe added that he also has the benefit of not facing Murphy, who was seeking reelection and could rely on his incumbent status.\n\n“I’m not competing with a pandemic this time around,” he added. “It wasn’t easy campaigning for governor during a shelter-in-place. I’m not going up against an incumbent. Murphy did leverage the power of incumbency. [Sherrill’s] not an incumbent.” \n\nBut the biggest contrast between the two races is that there’s “a lot less indifference this time around.”\n\n“Back in ‘21, I had too many people inside New Jersey, including Republicans, and people around the country didn’t think I had a shot in hell,” he said. “They now know differently because of our performance in ‘21.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump, then a former president, did not endorse Ciattarelli in 2021. The New Jersey Republican was a Trump critic and historically more centrist. This year, however, Ciattarelli coalesced the MAGA vote and earned himself a Trump endorsement.\n\nThe president amped up his support of Ciattarelli in the final weeks of the campaign by holding telerallies for the GOP candidate. Close Trump allies also threw millions of dollars into a pro-Ciattarelli super PAC to help bolster his campaign.\n\nCiattarelli praised the reception he has gotten from Latino voters as “overwhelmingly positive” across the state — a voting bloc that makes up nearly 22% of New Jersey’s population. The minority group historically has supported Democrats, but they shifted significantly to Trump last year.\n\nTrump only lost New Jersey to then-Vice President Kamala Harris by 6 points. Kenny Gonzalez, a Hispanic spokesperson for the New Jersey Republican State Committee, told CNN that the margin was aided by a sizable shift in minority support.\n\n“President Trump could not have done as well as he did without getting Democrat Hispanics to vote for him, and Jack Ciattarelli is not going to win this election without getting Democrat Hispanics to vote for him,” Gonzalez said. “So many Democrats are leaving the Democrat Party simply because the Democrat Party has gone too far left.”\n\nA Fox News poll conducted earlier in October found that a slim majority, 53%, of Hispanic registered voters would cast a ballot for Sherrill. With margins of error, Ciattarelli could see an opportunity to pick up centrist or Democratic-leaning minority voters in the days leading up to Tuesday’s election.\n\n“We only have ‘21 to compare it to,” Ciattarelli said. “I really thought I was going to win that race. You know how close we came, and this one feels very different. Energy up and down the state is electric.”\n\nMeanwhile, Sherrill is holding a rally with Barack Obama on Saturday evening. The former president has made New Jersey a fresh test of his endorsement power as Democrats seek to keep the GOP from gaining a foothold in the Garden State. Sherrill also recently held events with former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and several congressional Democrats who are stumping for her in the bellwether race.\n\nBut Ciattarelli is not fazed.\n\n“This is what I refer to the choreography of campaigns, but at the end of the day, I really believe, especially in New Jersey, the candidate has to win the race,” Ciattarelli said, adding that a good candidate has to get out, shake people’s hands, and talk to them every day.\n\n“I think we’ve done that a hell of a lot better than my opponent.”\n\n2025 ELECTIONS LIVE UPDATES: LATEST ON RACES IN VIRGINIA, NEW JERSEY, AND NEW YORK\n\nTrump supporters throw weight behind Ciattarelli\n\nCiattarelli’s supporters who met him in Bridgewater are no strangers to high-energy situations. A group of them are frequent regulars at “Trump’s Corner,” a spot in Bedminster, New Jersey, at the corner of Lambington Road and I-206.\n\nThere, they wear their Trump and American flag T-shirts, wave flags supporting the president, and try to provide a sense of community for conservatives in the area.\n\nDebbie Allen, 61, who is a member of Trump’s Corner, said it was important for her to come out to Bridgewater Municipal Court because “I love my country.”\n\nShe said she admires that Ciattarelli is “born and bred” in New Jersey. Though Sherrill has a long-standing political career in New Jersey, she was born in Virginia — a fact that put off Allen.\n\n“That proves a lot, [Ciattarelli] knows our state, and that’s important, because I’m a Jersey girl,” Allen said.\n\nShe has four grown children and a grandson, and though they do not live in New Jersey, the election for her is critical because “it’s the future for them.”\n\nFor Donna Whitehead, also a Trump’s Corner member, the election for her is a lesser of two evils.\n\n“My main thing, to be perfectly honest, is it’s kind of like when Trump was running against Hillary [Clinton],” Whitehead said. “I didn’t even like Trump, but I liked Hillary even less, so I only voted for Trump because I hated Hillary. And that’s what this is now. I absolutely don’t like [Sherrill], so that’s why I’m voting for [Ciattarelli].”\n\n“So [Ciattarelli] better freaking perform,” Whitehead added, noting that “all of my eggs are in this basket. “If he don’t, he’s gonna have his feet in the fire, that’s all I got to say.”\n\nDawn Douglas, a community supporter and traditional Republican voter, said taxes are her top concern, and she thinks Ciattarelli’s personality is more approachable than Sherrill’s.\n\n“Jack’s a very people person,” Douglas said. “His personality and working with the people, I think, would be a better fit [for governor]. More personal. … I don’t see that with her.”\n\nRon Cerenzio, of Bridgewater, said he is a “fiscal conservative” who has voted both Democratic and Republican over the years. But lately, he has aligned more with the GOP — particularly as he has seen the cost of living in New Jersey grow with no real change from the Murphy administration, in his opinion.\n\n“I have the perspective of a newly retired person, I know how hard it’s been for retired people and why people leave the state,” because the cost of living is too high, he said. “It’s challenging to live in this state under the current economic status.”\n\nCiattarelli, he said, is the best choice because he has “got a detailed plan as to what he’s going to do to fix it.”\n\n“Mikie, they throw questions at her and she gives these, like, generic responses,” Cerenzio said. “But she doesn’t articulate a specific plan. You talk to Jack about energy, he’s got specific details, and if you talk to him about property taxes, he has specific details. I don’t get any of that from her.”\n\nBoth Whitehead and Terry Beck, who helped lead efforts on the recall campaign for Murphy in 2020 and is the founder and organizer of Trump’s Corner since 2018, said they liked Ciattarelli because of his similarities to Trump.\n\n“They’re both sincere,” Beck said. “When you assess people, you can tell the realness of a person and the fairness.”\n\n2025 ELECTIONS LIVE UPDATES: LATEST ON RACES IN VIRGINIA, NEW JERSEY, AND NEW YORK\n\nLeaving to cheers and praise of him being a community-first candidate, Ciattarelli had a message for voters.\n\n“Don’t wait til Tuesday,” Ciattarelli said. “Anything can happen. Family emergency, not feeling well, something at work. Get out there and vote. This is really convenient and secure.”","summary":"BRIDGEWATER TOWNSHIP, New Jersey — Despite the blustering winds, overcast sky, and leaves leaping into people’s faces, energy outside the Bridgewater Municipal Court in New Jersey was high as supporters waited eagerly for Republican Jack Ciattarelli to arrive on Friday ahead of the state’s competitive gubernatorial election.

This is what I know: KENNEDY","text":"Did someone order a dumpster? Because they're throwing out the trash at the Tiffany Network.\n\nNew Media baddie Bari Weiss – recently named CBS News editor-in-chief – seems to be taking her mandate to bring balance to the Lefty newsroom (and their bottom line) extremely seriously. And that may mean presenting some pricey scalps to her new boss, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison.\n\nCBS Mornings anchor Gayle King has reportedly been dethroned and she's expected to be roused from her AM roost as soon as next year.\n\nAccording to King, it's all a bunch of hooey, saying on Friday that she has 'no idea' if she'll be booted come 2026. Then CBS News said, 'there have been no discussions with Gayle about her contract that runs through May 2026.'\n\nAs far as denials go, that one's about as weak as Joe Biden's golf game.\n\nAfter all, King's compadre CBS Evening News anchor Nora O'Donnell was recently toppled. O'Blabbel received an Oprah Winfrey-narrated highlight reel as a sendoff on her final broadcast in January. I wonder what Gayle – Oprah's life-long (platonic) partner – would get?\n\nIt would make sense to me that King's massive salary (reportedly north of $10 million) and lackluster ratings aren't cutting it with Queen Weiss. \n\nGayle's news squad has been getting shellacked by ABC's Good Morning America and NBC's Today Show and 'making the podium' isn't quite as impressive when you're in third place… out of three.\n\nI met Gayle King once. She carries herself with the royal air of a politician or a moneyed Scientologist. She has the megawatt smile and thousand-yard stare of someone who has perfected the art of seeming genuine even when they see right past you. \n\nIt's impressive to behold, but there's an emptiness about her that viewers seem to have gravitated away from.\n\nOf course, that wasn't the experience of my Fox News' colleague Jesse Watters. He and Gayle made mile-high headlines when they sat next to each other on a recent flight and posted about their pairing on social media.\n\nWatters tells me he was positively giddy, almost smitten, over his time with Ms. King. But Gayle's liberal followers were absolutely disgusted that she didn't shiv him with her first-class butter knife.\n\nPerhaps Gayle was reading the writing on the wall. (You've got to be savvy to last in Oprah's orbit for so long… just ask Meghan Markle.)\n\nCould it be that Gayle was trying to cozy up to a conservative celebrity like Jesse, hoping a bit of the star dust sprinkled on her? \n\nWho could blame her for trying?\n\nWeiss (former New York Times dissenter and founder of the Free Press) has her sights fixed on CBS's big egos and diminishing returns.\n\nThis week, newsy nepo baby and CBS veteran John Dickerson escorted himself out the building, announcing he'll resign at year's end. His mom Nancy was CBS' first female correspondent. But he met the estrogen-drenched buzzsaw of another lady pioneer when Ms. Weiss took over.\n\nAnother one who should be looking over his shoulder is 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley. He put a target on his own back when he delivered a tantrum/sermon at the Wake Forest commencement in May, chucking a few thinly veiled grenades at President Donald Trump and wailing about 'truth seekers' being made to 'live in fear.'\n\nNow, he's reportedly got something to really be scared of: a pink slip.\n\nPelley's 60 Minutes colleague Bill Whitaker is also said to be out of favor with the new regime. His botched, softball interview with Kamala Harris resulted in a $16 million payout to the Trump Presidential Library.\n\nSo, is Gayle really headed for the garbage heap? Only time will tell. And I wouldn't put it past Winfrey's bestie to have a few tricks up her stockings. But if you see her 'accidentally' sitting next to Sean Hannity on his next flight, you'll know something is up.\n\nNo matter what happens, one thing is certain: Weiss is right to demand objectivity at CBS, to stop that newsroom from operating like a political action committee and to return the network to good old fashioned storytelling.\n\nMirror, mirror\n\nShe's rich, famous, insufferably woke and blessed with glossy tumbles of long dark hair.\n\nNo wonder permanently smug, unemployed soy boy Justin Trudeau said that he thinks Katy Perry is 'perfect.'\n\nShe has all the qualities that he values most: his own!\n\nOfficer Undies\n\nA Detroit cop is going viral after appearing for a virtual court hearing in police officer's shirt and underwear\n\nWhen the judge asked, 'You got some pants on, officer?' the red-faced arrester replied, 'No sir' before adjusting his camera away from his Motor City man parts.\n\nSomewhere Jeffrey Toobin is saying: 'See, it happens to everyone.'\n\nOne small step…\n\nNoted astrophysicist Kim Kardashian thinks the moon landing was faked.\n\nShe cited debunked conspiracy theories like the bogus claim that moonwalking American hero Buzz Aldrin's once said, 'It didn't happen.'\n\nHey Kim, why not have a rover land on your booty?\n\nSome say that's fake too.\n\nGoodnight Zohran\n\nOn a podcast this week, NYC mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani couldn't identify Billy Joel as the artist who sang 'New York State of Mind.'\n\nNewsflash, Zohran: The Piano Man has sold out Madison Square Garden 150 times!\n\nIf Mamdani is elected, then I'm… Movin' Out.\n\nDouble trouble\n\nA braless Sydney Sweeney showed off her twin talents at Variety's Power of Women Award show in LA this week.\n\nI'm talking about her beauty and style, of course.\n\nIf only folks could focus on them.\n\nMusician Billie Eilish railed against billionaires while accepting an award at the _WSJ Magazine _Innovator Awards on Wednesday.\n\n'Love you all, but there's a few people in here that have a lot more money than me,' Eilish told the crowd which included Mark Zuckerberg and George Lucas. 'If you're a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? No hate, but yeah, give your money away, shorties.'\n\nBillie – you're worth an estimated $50 million.\n\nYou don't need all that money, do you?\n\nMeghan and Harry were loudly booed at Dodger Stadium as they took in a World Series game on Tuesday night.\n\nWhen the 'Kiss Cam' caught the pair, the crowd seemed to say, 'Kiss my ***.'\n\nThe pair was sitting in front_ _of two legends of Los Angeles sports: Magic Johnson and Sandy Koufax.\n\nThose dudes are true royalty.\n\nReady to rumble\n\nCongressional rodeo clown Marjorie Taylor Greene is going to be a guest on The View next week.\n\nIf you thought that Maury Povich's paternity test reveals made for good daytime TV… this one might be for you.\n\nFor once, Whoopi might seem like the sane one.","summary":"I met Gayle once.

Four contests, in particular, are in the spotlight: the New York City mayoral race, the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections, and California’s Proposition 50. NYC Mayoral Race Arguably the most watched of the four, the New York City mayoral election has captivated voters across the nation. Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani stunned the political establishment by defeating Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary, campaigning on affordability and lowering the cost of living. Cuomo, despite his loss and hampered sexual misconduct scandals from his time as governor, entered the general election as an independent. He has since won the backing of incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and several influential Democrats, including Rep. Tom Suozzi. Meanwhile, Gov. Kathy Hochul, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Sen. Bernie Sanders have endorsed Mamdani, who holds a commanding lead in polls and is widely expected to win on Election Day. Virginia In Virginia, Democrats are looking to reclaim the governor’s mansion, pinning their hopes on Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who faces incumbent Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. Polls show Spanberger maintaining a steady lead over Earle-Sears. The Attorney General race is also drawing attention. Incumbent Republican Jason Miyares faces Democrat Jay Jones, who has been dogged by controversy after 2022 texts resurfaced in which he fantasized about shooting then–House Speaker Todd Gilbert. Jones has apologized for what he called a “grave mistake,” but the scandal has clouded his campaign. Analysts expect Democrats to regain control of the governor’s office, lieutenant governorship, and legislature, while Miyares is narrowly favored to hold on to his post. New Jersey New Jersey, which has leaned Republican in recent elections, including the 2024 presidential and 2021 governor’s race, is again a battleground. Democratic Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill is facing off against Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who has President Donald Trump’s endorsement. The race remains tight: an Emerson College poll puts Sherrill at 49% and Ciattarelli at 48% among likely voters. The contest is considered a toss-up, with Democrats slightly favored. California Prop 50 While other races remain close, California’s Proposition 50 appears headed for a decisive outcome. The measure, championed by Democrats, seeks to temporarily redraw the state’s congressional map in response to Texas’ recent redistricting, which added five Republican-leaning seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. Because California’s constitution requires voter approval for changes to its independent redistricting commission, the proposal, which will give Democrats an advantage in 5 seats, must pass at the ballot box. Polls suggest it will, by a wide margin. Governor Gavin Newsom, joined by Barack Obama and Kamala Harris, has campaigned heavily for Proposition 50. Reports indicate Republicans have largely withdrawn funding from efforts to oppose it, acknowledging an uphill battle.
