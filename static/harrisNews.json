potentially explosive stoush over Taiwan's participation in a key regional meeting next month by restricting the gathering to Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) members — effectively excluding China, the US and a host of other countries as well.\n\nSolomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele is under increasing pressure over whether his country will allow Taiwan's representatives to attend the Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting in Honiara this September.\n\nTaiwan has long attended the meeting as a \"development partner\" and has used that opportunity to meet with Pacific \"allies\" that extend its diplomatic recognition — although that band has now dwindled to just three nations.\n\nBut Beijing remains intent on doing everything it can to isolate Taiwan diplomatically, and has been pressing Solomon Islands to break with tradition and exclude Taiwan entirely, stirring anger among Taipei's remaining allies, and stoking frustration in Canberra and Wellington.\n\nChina responded furiously at last year's PIF leaders meeting in Tonga when Pacific leaders reaffirmed the status quo, and earlier this year, Solomon Islands refused to issue visas to Taiwanese officials who wanted to enter Honiara to help prepare for their delegation.\n\nNow the ABC has been told Mr Manele is likely to propose to fellow Pacific leaders that the annual dialogue with PIF partners be deferred entirely, until after a broader review of regional diplomatic architecture is complete.\n\nThat review, which includes a proposal to establish a new \"tiered\" system for PIF dialogue partners, was meant to be finished in time for the leaders' meeting in September, but has been hit with delays.\n\nBy deferring the dialogue, Solomon Islands will effectively block not just China and Taiwan from sending delegations to Honiara, but a host of other countries as well, including from Asia, Europe and the Middle East.\n\nWhile Mr Manele is likely to present the proposal as procedural, an Australian government source said it was \"obvious\" that Solomon Islands was also \"looking for a solution to the Taiwan problem\", which both Beijing and Taiwan's Pacific allies could live with.\n\nPalau's President Surangel Whipps Jr has already warned that singling out and excluding Taiwan could risk a reprise of the \"PIF split\" that rocked the forum a few years ago.\n\nTuvalu's Climate Change Minister Maina Talia also took aim at China last week, saying Pacific nations that chose to recognise Taiwan also had the right to meet with their key partner at the leaders' meeting.\n\nAnna Powles from Massey University said the compromise being put forward by Mr Manele would \"de-escalate a geopolitically charged situation\" but was also \"evidence that geopolitics has coopted the Forum Leaders Meeting.\"\n\nOne Pacific official told the ABC that while no final decision had been made — and that the PIF Secretariat would have to endorse the proposal — Mr Manele's compromise might be the \"only solution\" if Solomon Islands was determined not to let Taiwan's representatives into the country.\n\nThey also said Mr Manele and the PIF Secretariat would be able to point to a precedent: Fiji also excluded dialogue partners when they hosted the leaders meeting in 2022, saying Pacific nations needed to focus on healing rifts from the PIF split.\n\nDr Powles said while restricting the meeting to PIF members would help \"reduce distractions\" from the Forum's \"heavy agenda\", it was \"unlikely to please forum partners who will be looking to Honiara as a chance to jockey for favour\".\n\nShe also said Solomon Islands was simply \"kicking the geopolitical can down the road to Palau, an ally of Taiwan, [which will host the meeting] in 2026.\"\n\nShe also said some major PIF partners might be invited to deliver online or virtual presentations to the gathering instead, as then-US Vice President Kamala Harris did in 2022.\n\nBoth Australia and New Zealand have been pressing Solomon Islands not to exclude Taiwan from the September gathering, but neither country has publicly criticised Honiara for its reluctance to allow Taipei to participate.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told the ABC that Australia \"values the forum's engagement with international partners at the annual leaders meeting, which provides an opportunity to strengthen the Pacific's voice in global affairs\".\n\n\"We understand arrangements for the Forum Leaders Meeting in Honiara in September are currently being finalised by the Solomon Islands government with the Pacific Islands Forum secretariat,\" they said.\n\nChina has made substantial diplomatic inroads in Solomon Islands since it coaxed the Pacific nation into switching diplomatic recognition from Taiwan in 2019, and both Mr Manele and his predecessor, Manasseh Sogavare, have since been vocal supporters of Beijing's One China principle.\n\nWhile Mr Manele has drawn little domestic political criticism over the issue, prominent Solomon Islands MP Peter Kenilorea Jr took aim at the government last month, saying it was evidence that China had undermined the country's sovereignty.\n\nDr Powles said it was \"timely\" that PIF leaders in Honiara would deliberate over the \"Ocean of Peace\" framework proposed by Fiji's Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, as well as \"deciding how they want to manage geopolitical tensions in the Pacific.\"\n\nThe ABC has approached both Mr Manele's office and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat for comment.","summary":"Solomon

3","text":"When one door closes, a guest spot opens.\n\n Stephen Colbert's days on CBS's The Late Show may be numbered, but the comedian is already exploring some new ventures, including a role on CBS's Elsbeth — as a late-night host. \n\n Entertainment Weekly has learned that Colbert is set to guest-star in a season 3 episode of the murder mystery series. Colbert's character will host the fictional show, Way Late with Scotty Bristol, according to Vulture, which first reported the news.\n\n Representatives for Colbert did not immediately respond to EW's inquiries, while a rep for CBS declined to comment.\n\n The timing of Colbert's newest CBS collab is certainly auspicious. Late last month, the network announced that The Late Show With Stephen Colbert would conclude next year, ending the franchise — which began with David Letterman in 1993 — after 33 years on the air. \n\n EW has learned that plans for Colbert's appearance on Elsbeth were set in motion months before that announcement. Back in February, Colbert welcomed Elsbeth star Wendell Pierce to The Late Show and, during their conversation, said that he's been dying to appear on a procedural like Elsbeth.\n\n \"I want to be the body that’s found behind the pile of lettuce boxes or something like that,\" he joked.\n\n Pierce immediately offered to help out: \"I can make that happen,” he quipped. \"I know a guy who knows a guy. We can get you on.\"\n\n Whether Colbert will be a murderer, an ally, or a produce-stashed corpse remains to be seen, but it seems Pierce delivered on his promise to make a few calls. \n\n A spinoff of The Good Wife and The Good Fight, Elsbeth follows the astute but unconventional attorney Elsbeth Tascioni (Carrie Preston) as she uses her unique observations to solve a new murder each week. As a guest star, Colbert is in esteemed company; the series has also welcomed Nathan Lane, Keegan-Michael Key, Laurie Metcalf, Mary-Louise Parker, Laura Benanti, Matthew Broderick, and more.\n\n With the new season set to arrive in October, the comedian will remain busy hosting his actual late-night show until May.\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n In announcing the end of The Late Show, CBS said its decision to pull the plug on the franchise was \"purely a financial one\" and that it wasn't \"related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.\"\n\n But many critics have questioned the timing of the announcement, pointing out that Colbert had recently criticized CBS' corporate parent, Paramount Global, for agreeing to pay $16 million to President Donald Trump over an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that aired on 60 Minutes in November. Trump has long disliked late-night hosts' jokes about his administration and celebrated news of The Late Show's cancellation on social media, writing that Colbert's \"talent was even less than his ratings.\n\n For his part, Colbert has not backed down, continuing to openly criticize Trump and his administration throughout the president's second term. Reacting to Trump's post about his cancellation, Colbert said, \"How dare you sir. Would an untalented man be able to compose the following satirical witticism: Go f--- yourself.\"","summary":"You can take the late-night show away from the host, but you can't drag the host away from late-night.","url":"https://ew.com/stephen-colbert-gets-new-cbs-late-night-gig-elsbeth-season-3-11783962","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/PpsjoVhwCTRybQlvvuIzPkWzSVU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/stephen-colbert-080325-15f9350248834d599b844c62a382842e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-04 00:03:36","author":"Shania Russell","authors":["Shania Russell"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":347873520,"title":"'The View' co-host describes Harris interview as 'microcosm of everything that's wrong' with Democratic Party","text":"\"The View\" co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin described former Vice President Kamala Harris' interview with Stephen Colbert as a \"microcosm\" of everything that's wrong with the Democratic Party after the party lost in 2024. \"I was struck by, I’m going to try not be too harsh on this. This interview felt like a microcosm of everything that’s wrong with Democrats post-election. I’m going to CBS and this sort of trying to make a point that they fired Stephen Colbert, which many on the left called an attack on democracy, a man who was making $20 million a year, someone I hold in high esteem, but the economics of his show were not working,\" Griffin said during an appearance on CNN's \"Table for Five\" on Saturday. CBS announced in July that they would be ending Colbert's late-night show at the end of the next broadcast season, citing financial reasons. However, Colbert's liberal allies believe the cancellation was political, as it came days after he criticized CBS' parent company, Paramount, for settling with President Donald Trump. \"He was losing $40 million a year. He was in the Ed Sullivan Theater, which is expensive, to talk about the plight of democracy at CBS, a network that’s having its own struggles right now, rather than talking about the economics of the situation and playing to something a shrinking audience that is network television, not realizing it’s not where the American voters are,\" Griffin, an anti-Trump Republican who voted for Harris in 2024, continued. KAMALA HARRIS SCOLDS ‘PILING ON’ AGAINST JOE BIDEN WHEN ASKED ABOUT SEPARATING HERSELF DURING 2024 CAMPAIGN Griffin said Harris decision to appear on Colbert was like \"announcing your exploratory committee on the sinking deck of the Titanic.\" CNN data analyst Harry Enten dismissed Harris' comments during the interview about a broken system. \"Recently, I made the decision that I just – for now, I don’t want to go back in the system. I think it’s broken,\" Harris told Colbert after he asked about her declining a potential California gubernatorial run. \"I just can‘t possibly believe that someone who was attorney general for a good period of time, a United States senator for a good period of time, and then vice president for four years and then ran for president, all of a sudden believes that the best way to solve it is from being outside the system. Oh, please. Not a chance on God‘s green earth that that’s necessarily the case,\" Enten said, reacting to Harris' remarks. CNN PANEL SHREDS HARRIS' COLBERT INTERVIEW FOR HER LACK OF SOLUTIONS AFTER 'SIX MONTHS TO FIGURE IT OUT' \"What‘s probably going on is she saw what the polling numbers were, perhaps for her running for governor of California. Yes, she has left open the idea that maybe she could run in 2028 for the Democratic nomination. But I‘ll tell you Abby, I‘ve looked at those numbers. She would be the weakest front-runner since 1992. So the bottom line is this, she is looking at the numbers. She knows what‘s cooking. And then all of a sudden, you know what? Actually, this lifelong politician, I want to be outside the system.

I mean, Stephen A Smith, he's just like every other talk show host.”\n\nSmith made it clear that, while he disagreed with the parallel drawn, other remarks by the first lady had irritated him more.\n\n“You said a vote for Trump was a vote against you and a vote against y'all as women,” Smith said. “I want to stay for the record, I took major offense to that. Black men don't just love our black women, we revere y'all. \n\n“It's who we are.

It follows astute but unconventional attorney Elsbeth Tascioni (Preston), who utilizes her singular point of view to make unique observations and corner brilliant criminals alongside the NYPD.\n\nColbert’s episode was filmed this week; however, his guest appearance has been months in the making. In February, during Pierce’s appearance on The Late Show, Colbert asked the actor if he could help him land a role on Elsbeth, as he’s been wanting “to be a corpse on one of these shows.” Pierce happily responded, “I can make that happen.

However, the show’s cancellation announcement came after Colbert criticized Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, for agreeing to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit from President Donald Trump, who sued over former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 60 Minutes interview. The network said in a statement that it wasn’t a factor in the decision to end the show.\n\nSources previously told THR that Paramount believed the lawsuit posed a threat to the Paramount-Skydance merger, which was awaiting approval by the FCC under the Trump administration.

I really do. I think that they know this is the issue that has gotten the base riled up, the MAGA base isn’t letting this issue go and for the first time they can probably take their party back and not piss off the MAGA base. I think they’re going to do that.”\n\nThe Epstein case has dominated news coverage in recent weeks after the Justice Department said it will not be releasing any additional documents from the Epstein sex trafficking investigation. The decision has infuriated online sleuths, conspiracy theorists and elements of Trump’s base who had hoped to see proof of a government cover-up.\n\nOfficials have said Epstein killed himself in his New York jail cell while awaiting trial in 2019, but his case has generated endless attention and conspiracy theories because of his links to famous people, including Trump and other billionaires.\n\nTrump on social media called Charlamagne a “racist sleazebag” and criticized his use of God in his professional nickname.\n\n“Can anyone imagine the uproar there would be if I used that nickname?” Trump asked.\n\nCharlamagne told Lara Trump that his criticism of the Republican president was not new, adding that he “gave President Biden the same hell” when he didn’t think the Democrat was doing a good job.","summary":"Trump said on Truth Social that Charlamagne was a “dope” who voted for Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/08/03/trump-attacks-charlamagne-tha-god-after-radio-host-criticizes-his-presidency/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/My_View_with_Lara_Trump__47332-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 21:17:06","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.3},{"id":347855060,"title":"Trump officials scramble to justify firing of economic statistician – as critics say ‘scary’ move is a sign of ‘authoritiarianism’","text":"Members of Donald Trump’s team scrambled to provide coherent explanations for the sudden firing of a top official at the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Sunday as Friday’s firing resonated throughout Washington and left the White House open to criticism of Trump’s “authoritarian” leanings.\n\nThe US president directed the firing of Erika McEntarfer on Friday after a jobs report showed private companies adding just 73,000 positions in July, a drop from projections and a further sign that the Trump economy is stalling in the face of growing uncertainty around the president’s tariff agenda.\n\nMcEntarfer’s firing was immediately denounced by her Trump-appointed predecessor and numerous others in Washington. Republicans on the Hill struggled to defend it, while members of Donald Trump’s team insisted in interviews that the president and the nation needed what he called “reliable” numbers. Trump accused McEntarfer of cooking the numbers on Kamala Harris’s behalf during the 2024 election, and now working to make him look bad, a notion even the president’s own advisers wouldn’t echo directly.\n\nKevin Hassett, director of the White House economic council, led the efforts to defend the president’s decision-making on Sunday. He was joined by Jamieson Greer, the US trade representative. Hassett directly contradicted the president during his interview on Fox News Sunday with Shannon Bream; he argued that it was the formula by which the BLS determined job market gains — not malicious activity by McEntarfer — which needed to be addressed.\n\nPointing to a letter from McEntarfer’s predecessors, Bream asked Hassett: “They’re saying it’s not good to cast aspersions on what’s being done because it’s a formula. It’s used the same way every single time. So are you saying maybe the formulas, the calculations need to change?”\n\n“That’s right. They really need to get back to ground zero and find out why these numbers are so unreliable,” said Hassett.”\n\n\"The data can't be propaganda. The data has to be something you can trust, because decision-makers throughout the economy trust that these are the data that they can build a factory because they believe, or cut interest rates because they believe. And if the data aren't that good, then it's a real problem for the US,” Hassett continued.\n\nHe and others pointed to the agency revising totals for May and June as evidence that the BLS required changes: “We expect more big revisions for the jobs data in September, for example ... we want to know why, we want people to explain it to us.”\n\nGreer, during a pre-taped interview with CBS’s Face the Nation, backed up Hassett’s claims that sharp revisions dating back to 2024 were evidence of the numbers produced by the agency being unreliable.\n\n\"You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers,” he said. “There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways.” \n\nBut there’s still nothing linking McEntarfer to the kind of nefarious activity which Trump alleged she was up to in a Truth Social post.\n\n“I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can’t be manipulated for political purposes,” Trump wrote on Friday. \n\nHe added: “In my opinion, today’s Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad — Just like when they had three great days around the 2024 Presidential Election, and then, those numbers were ‘taken away’ on November 15, 2024, right after the Election.”\n\nNo one on the president’s team has attempted to present any evidence backing up Trump’s claims.\n\nA number of McEntarfer’s predecessors and other top officialst at the BLS fired back in a statement from a group called the “Friends of the BLS”: “The President seeks to blame someone for unwelcome economic news.”\n\nThe president’s critics said that the firing and unsupported explanation meant that future figures released by the agency would be thrown into question and was an example of Trump desiring ability to dictate the creation of phony statistics.\n\n“This is the stuff of democracies giving way to authoritarianism,” warned Larry Summers, former director of the White House economic council under Biden (and Hassett’s predecessor), on ABC’s This Week. “This is really scary stuff, and it can hardly be surprising that when the rule of law is in a bit question that there’s a big uncertainty premium in the markets.”\n\nHe went on to argue that Trump’s battering of Fed Chair Jerome Powell followed in a similar vein, and was behind much of the uncertainty curbing U.S. investments on Wall Street.\n\nFriday marked the resumption of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs; enforcement of rates as high as 50% on some U.S. trading partners will resume this week.\n\nEconomists largely agree that those tariffs are driving up consumer prices and stifling U.S. investment rather than encouraging the return of manufacturing plants to America as companies continue to evaluate new costs stemming from Trump’s import duties.\n\nThe job numbers put out by the BLS on a monthly basis are some of the most important statistics gathered by the U.S. government in terms of their ability to move financial markets around the world. Experts say the sharp revisions are a result of more accurate data collection efforts.","summary":"Trump’s allies defend firing of ‘propaganda’ author, but won’t echo president’s claims numbers were cooked by Biden appointee","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-bls-firing-jobs-numbers-b2801230.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/03/19/38/hassett_kevin_ftn_2025.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/0gm6JCUt-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-03 20:49:05","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":347847502,"title":"\"To blackmail emotionally in trying to compel us to vote\" - Stephen A.

That started with Booker telling Democrats to download TikTok on their personal devices so the party could (supposedly) reach young voters. Booker is urging this to get around the ban on downloading the Chinese spyware app for government devices, and because he is convinced that social media can boost his campaign to victory.\n\nIn his latest stunt on the Senate floor, Booker channeled his inner theater kid to scream and shout about Democrats being “complicit” in President Donald Trump’s agenda. His inauthentic performance was compounded by the inauthenticity of his message: The bills he was blocking were bipartisan law enforcement bills that Democrats otherwise unanimously supported. The stunt earned him a reprimand from Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who insinuated that Booker was too lazy to show up to present amendments for the bills before his embarrassing performance.\n\nBooker is trying to take up the “fighter” lane, but there is a real contender for the nomination also planning on occupying it. Enter Gavin Newsom, who has been measuring the drapes for the Oval Office going back to at least 2022. Newsom has tried to portray himself as more moderate, launching a podcast where he can talk to conservative guests and pretend that he isn’t a radical progressive on guns or transgenderism. Despite his faux moderation on cultural issues, he has actually quietly moderated (or tried to moderate) California policy on issues such as energy, in order to avoid embarrassing headlines about how his state can’t keep the lights on or about soaring gas prices.\n\nBut, going back to 2019, Newsom has positioned himself as a fighter against Trump’s policies. Newsom started 2025 by announcing that California (which has been dealing with a budget crisis under Newsom’s stewardship for years) would be setting aside $50 million to sue the Trump administration. Most recently, Newsom wants to overturn California’s congressional map, which has been gerrymandered by an “independent” commission, to craft a more severely gerrymandered map and give Democrats a boost in the 2026 elections, which Newsom is framing as a fight against Trump “rigging” the 2026 elections.\n\nNewsom’s argument is simple and predictable: He is the governor of the largest Democratic state in the country and has used California’s government and economy to push back on Trump at every turn. Newsom is polling at 10% in that mid-July Echelon Insights poll, just behind Pete Buttigieg at 11%.\n\nButtigieg’s inevitable campaign is going to be focused on the areas where Democrats fell short last year. Buttigieg is already doing the rounds in alternative media and reaching out to the young men who have abandoned the party. Buttigieg wants to double-dip with Democrats by claiming credit for all the things Democrats like about the Biden administration while distancing himself from the distasteful parts that he had less control over (such as school closures). \n\nBelieve it or not, Harris is still the top dog in the field until proven otherwise. In that same poll that has Buttigieg and Newsom barely cracking double digits, Harris leads the field at 26%. She declined to enter the field in the California governor’s race, a decision made with eyes toward 2028, even though she claims she is not planning on running for president (something that just about every presidential candidate claims even if they are clearly planning on running).\n\nHarris will flaunt her identitarian credentials (the first black woman to be vice president) and all the supposed good Democrats think the Biden administration achieved, while daring anyone to challenge her on it. She will claim that no one could have done any better with a truncated campaign (which is what her supporters have been saying since she lost last year).\n\nDemocrats also changed the primary calendar order before the 2024 elections to benefit her and Biden by placing South Carolina first in the order. The DNC’s goal was to give black voters the first say in the primary process, and Harris gets the most support from those voters among the hypothetical candidates. (Side note: Buttigieg pulls an impressive 0% in polls among black voters).\n\nThere are other minor candidates that will litter the field. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is a lesser version of Newsom. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro is the popular governor of a swing state who presents as a moderate despite being a progressive, but his being Jewish is a liability in an increasingly antisemitic party. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz wants some kind of role in the future of the party, but it won’t ever be at the top of the ticket.\n\nThere is one remaining potential candidate, though, to fill the Bernie Sanders wing of the primary. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is 35 years old and the heir apparent to the socialist base of the 83-year-old Sanders. Ocasio-Cortez opened for Sanders on his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, polishing her performance in front of crowds. Sanders almost certainly will not run due to his age. While Ocasio-Cortez is polling in the mid-single digits early, Sanders won 26% of the vote in the 2020 primary, meaning those voters would be inclined to back whoever Sanders endorses.\n\nCOMEBACK KAMALA? HARRIS HOLDS ON TO HER PRESIDENTIAL DREAMS\n\nAnd Ocasio-Cortez would be running as the socialist in the field at a time when socialism is building momentum in the party. Zohran Mamdani is going to be the next mayor of New York City, and Democrats want to take a page from the enthusiasm for his campaign to use in elections across the country. Ocasio-Cortez will be the candidate who can offer that on the Democratic stage, especially with the backing of Sanders and Mamdani.\n\nWhile there is still a whole election cycle between now and when Democrats will likely start declaring their presidential intentions, the positioning has already begun. Everything Harris, Newsom, Buttigieg, Ocasio-Cortez, and the rest of the likely field say and do over the coming two years can be boiled down to 2028 positioning, with most of them having already carved out their lanes and their main pitches to voters.","summary":"The 2028 presidential election is still over three years away, but the tracks are already being laid for the Democratic primary.

I haven't talked to Kamala about what her plans are,' Polis replied, kicking off the exchange. \n\n'I think what we need is the ability to make sure that we can build that coalition of 55, 58 percent, win, win decisively, turn our back on this divisive Trumpian era of politics and move forward with an era of prosperity and opportunity for the American people,' the Colorado Governor continued, riffing on what qualifications his ideal nominee would have. \n\nPolis then added that he thinks 'it's great that many people will hopefully run to be able to audition to see who has that voice and who's able to get that done and win and, of course, govern effectively to improve our quality of life,' without explicitly mentioning Harris, or any other potential presidential contenders. \n\nHunt then asked Polis if he was considering a 2028 run himself.\n\n'It's not something I have looked at.

Her Political Views in 2025 – Hollywood Life","text":"Sydney Sweeney has faced criticism for years, whether it comes to her celebrity image or her political views. Now that she’s the face of a new American Eagle jeans campaign, her name and face have become a viral topic on a divided internet. Fans are also curious whether or not she supports Donald Trump since her voter registration in Florida revealed that she registered with the Republican Party before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nBelow, Hollywood Life is breaking down what we know about Sweeney’s views on Trump.\n\nWhat Are Sydney Sweeney’s Political Views?\n\nIt appears that Sweeney is a registered Republican. The news didn’t emerge until August 2025 when multiple outlets, including Hollywood Life, viewed public voter registration records in Florida. It turns out that the Reality actress registered with the Republican Party of Florida in Monroe County on June 14, 2024. The home address she registered herself under was purchased earlier that month for $13 million, according to Zillow.\n\nSweeney has not publicly commented on her political views, though. She has never confirmed who she voted for in the 2024 election, nor whether she voted for any presidential candidate.\n\nIs Sydney Sweeney Actually a Trump Supporter?\n\nSweeney has not publicly shown any support for the Republican president. But since she’s a registered Republican, people assume that she may have voted for Trump along with millions of others.\n\nMultiple Republican politicians have notably criticized Trump since his 2024 campaign and election victory. Even some from his former inner circle opposed his candidacy and endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris, including Alyssa Farah Griffin, Cassidy Hutchinson and Anthony Scaramucci.\n\nEven though Sweeney is a Republican, her voter registration doesn’t prove any support for Trump. She hasn’t vocalized any support for the president.\n\nThe White House, however, defended American Eagle’s ad featuring Sweeney, with longtime Trump advisor Steven Cheung tweeting in July 2025, “Cancel culture run amok. This warped, moronic, and dense liberal thinking is a big reason why Americans voted the way they did in 2024. They’re tired of this bulls**t.”\n\nWhy Do People Think Sydney Sweeney’s Family Supports Trump?\n\nIn August 2022, Sweeney came under fire when photos and videos from her mother’s 60th birthday party circulated on social media. Party guests were seen wearing red “Make Sixty Great Again” hats, referring to Trump’s long-running slogan to “Make America Great Again.”\n\nSweeney defended her family against the backlash in a since-deleted X post (previously known as Twitter), noting that people were “making assumptions” about them.\n\n“You guys this is wild,” the Euphoria star wrote at the time. “An innocent celebration for my mom’s milestone 60th birthday has turned into an absurd political statement, which was not the intention. Please stop making assumptions. Much love to everyone ♥️ and Happy Birthday Mom!”\n\nLater that year, Sweeney commented on the controversy again while talking to British GQ.\n\n“Honestly, I feel like nothing I say can help the conversation,” Sweeney said. “It’s been turning into a wildfire, and nothing I can say will take it back to the correct track.”","summary":"Image Credit: Getty Images for Lionsgate Sydney Sweeney has faced criticism for years, whether it comes to her celebrity image or her political views.

But that dispute soon turned into a virtual free-for-all.\n\nNumerous male and female black youths sucker-punched a middle-aged woman. Others continued to kick or body slam the victims.\n\nThere were many disturbing aspects to the beat-downs.\n\nOne, the violence broke out along racial and age fault lines. After the initial dispute, groups of black youths swarmed solitary older white bystanders to pound them.\n\nTwo, the surrounding assembled group of black youths not only failed to intervene to restrain the bullies. They also recorded the beatings for social media and were heard cheering on the one-sided violence.\n\nThree, there was neither a police presence nor any timely Good Samaritan interventions.\n\nFour, oddly few of the usual black spokespeople who habitually comment on interracial violence were to be seen.\n\nDuring the fake Jussie Smollett attack, self-appointed leaders from Al Sharpton to Kamala Harris immediately issued warnings about so-called systemic white racism that had reared its ugly head to victimize Smollett.\n\nYet when it was revealed Smollett had concocted the entire charade — and even hired his own assaulters — there were few if any retractions from those once so eager to shout “racist!”\n\nSuch demagoguery is a well-known pattern dating back to the days of the Tawana Brawley rape hoax, the Duke Lacrosse charade, the Covington kids ruse, the Michael Ford “Hands-up-Don’t Shoot” fabrication or the NASCAR noose fable.\n\nRacialists too often concoct white racist attackers and go silent when the evidence proves fabricated — only to be primed to manipulate the next hoax.\n\nFive, the media and authorities did their best to either hide or play down the violence.\n\nCity leaders, the chief of police and the media variously blamed the mass black-on-white violence on 1) social media, 2) the original dispute, 3) alcohol, 4) the lack of civilian intervention to stop the violence and 5) a festival atmosphere — anything except endemic racial hatred shown toward whites from the crowd of black youths.\n\nSix, had a gang of white toughs beat middle-aged African-Americans senseless, recorded it and cheered on the violence, there would have been immediate national outrage.\n\nNor did anyone wish to raise the taboo topic of inordinate black crime rates, disproportionate to respective demographic realities.\n\nIn rare interracial violent crimes, the asymmetrical ratio of black-on-white versus white-on-black assaults ranges from three to five times greater.\n\nSeven, the quiet of the left-wing media to the reprehensible violence stands in marked contrast with their usual rush-to-judgment racialism in two near-simultaneous incidents.\n\nWhen a shooter entered a New York City corporate headquarters last week and executed four innocents, CNN falsely raised the speculation that a “white male” was perhaps responsible — despite the photograph of the suspect, who was as clearly male as he was not white.\n\nMedia and municipal officials jumped to explain the violence as due to the killer’s alleged past traumatic brain injury or because of his access to a semi-automatic weapon — or anything other than his hate-filled plan to murder an NFL executive.\n\nActress and model Sydney Sweeney just cut a jeans commercial in front of a poster that said, “Sydney Sweeney has great genes” — with “genes” crossed out and replaced with “jeans.”\n\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post’s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between.

Padilla says Dems should fight fire with fire - USA Today","text":"California's Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla said his party should be willing to fight fire with fire, in light of Texas' potential, controversial gerrymandering plans.\n\n\"If Republicans were confident on their policy agenda, they'd be eager to defend it with the people and to defend it at the ballot box next November,\" Padilla said in an Aug. 3 interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\n\"But they know they're in trouble,\" he continued. \"And so they're trying to rig the system to hold on to power.\"\n\nThe California senator was referencing Texas Republicans' proposed new map of their state's congressional districts, following President Donald Trump's urging that the GOP find a way to flip as many as five seats in next year's midterm elections.\n\n\"Just a very simple redrawing, we pick up five seats,\" Trump told reporters on July 15.\n\nPadilla likened Trump's ask of Texas Republicans to his request during his first term in office that a top Georgia official \"find 11,780 votes\" to put him over the top in the Electoral College for the 2020 election.\n\nRedistricting in the middle of the decade, rather than every ten years after new census data is collected, is rare. And the pushback from Democrats across the country has been widespread.\n\nBlue state leaders have threatened tit-for-tat responses, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has suggested redrawing his state's map to counteract Texas' efforts. (Newsom faces the challenge of a bipartisan redistricting commission, which oversees California's maps, unlike Texas, where lawmakers dictate the boundaries.)\n\nSome California Democrats are wary, warning that a redistricting arms race could spiral and erode trust with voters.\n\nIn response to those concerns, Padilla told NBC he believes it's appropriate for the Democrat-controlled state to evaluate its options.\n\n\"The ideal scenario,\" he said, \"is for Texas to stand down. They don't have to do this; they shouldn't do this. But if they were to go forward and deliver Trump his five additional Republicans ... the stakes are simply too high\" for Democrats not to respond.\n\nPadilla also addressed recent comments from his fellow Democrats about the state of politics and American democracy, including Sen. Cory Booker's call for his party to \"have a backbone.\"\n\n\"It's time for us to fight. It's time for us to draw lines,\" Booker said from the Senate floor on July 29.\n\nAsked whether Booker's defiant approach was the appropriate stance for Democrats under the Trump administration, Padilla said, \"Look, I think the extreme way in which this administration is conducting itself calls for higher and higher profile ways of pushing back.\"\n\nAfter announcing that she would not be running for California governor in 2026, former Vice President Kamala Harris appeared on CBS's \"The Late Show\" with Stephen Colbert.\n\nIn her interview on July 31, Harris told Colbert, \"Recently, I made the decision that, for now, I don't want to go back into the system. I think it's broken.\"\n\nPadilla agreed, in part, with Harris' take, saying, \"I think the system is under duress.\"\n\n\"Democrats are doing our part to try to stand up and push back,\" he added.","summary":"'They're trying to rig the system': Sen.

While the actual election remains years away, the results provide early signals of party dynamics and voter preferences as both Republican and Democratic fields take shape.Why North Carolina Polling MattersNorth Carolina has long been considered a battleground state with the power to sway national results. As a microcosm of broader U.S. political sentiment, primary polling in states like North Carolina can reveal emerging frontrunners and influential voter attitudes. With the 2028 cycle already stirring interest, these early tests offer insight into name recognition, party enthusiasm, and the evolving face of each party’s leadership.Emerson Poll Snapshot: Republicans vs DemocratsBetween July 28–30, 2025, pollsters surveyed 1,000 registered voters across North Carolina, including categorised subgroups of likely Republican and Democratic primary voters. The survey carries a margin of error of ±3 percentage points. These early results are especially notable given that major candidates have yet to officially declare runs, as mentioned in a report by Newsweek.Republican Field: Vice President Vance Leading by Wide MarginAmong likely Republican primary voters, Vice President J.D. Vance dominates with 53% support, far ahead of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (7%) and Senator Marco Rubio (5%). Conservative figures such as Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley draw lower single-digit support. Nearly 15% remain undecided, potentially leaving space for shifts as the field evolves. These results align with national polling: in a May Emerson poll, Vance led the GOP primary with 46% support, while DeSantis captured 8%, and Rubio 12% in other surveys. Democratic Outlook: Buttigieg Leads, But Harris Still CompetitorOn the Democratic side in North Carolina, Pete Buttigieg holds a narrow lead with 17%, followed by Kamala Harris at 12% and Gavin Newsom at 10%, with 24% undecided. Live EventsThis pattern reflects broader national trends: a June Emerson national poll showed Harris in the lead at 30% among Democratic primary voters, though Buttigieg and Newsom gained in second and third positions with single-digit percentages, as per a report by Newsweek.Public Sentiment Extends Beyond NamesBesides candidate preferences, the poll highlights key voter sentiments:40% of North Carolinians report their family’s finances are worse off than a year ago, while 28% say finances have improved and 32% report stability. These concerns may shape priorities for primary voters as they evaluate 2028 contenders on issues such as the economy, inflation, and job security, as per a report by Newsweek.Expert Commentary: Vance Gains, Democrats Await ClarityColumbia University political scientist Robert Y. Shapiro observed that early Democratic polling largely reflects name recognition rather than policy appeal. He added that Republican figures like DeSantis and Rubio carry baggage from past losses in high-profile contests, while Vance benefits from his vice-presidential platform and alignment with former President Trump’s MAGA agenda.What Happens Next: Timing and MessagingMost presidential hopefuls are unlikely to formally announce candidacies until after the 2026 midterm elections, a traditional milestone in modern campaigns. In the interim, potential candidates such as Buttigieg, Newsom, and Harris may increase national visibility through media appearances, speeches, and policy statements.On the Republican side, Vance’s commanding early lead positions him as the presumptive frontrunner, though undecided voters and favorable candidate shifts could alter the landscape as the next cycle approaches.Key TakeawaysVance’s Strength in GOP Primaries: With over half the Republican support in North Carolina, Vance emerges as the early favorite.Competitive Democratic Field: Buttigieg holds a slim edge in North Carolina, but the national picture remains fluid as voters weigh familiar names.Economic Anxiety: Many North Carolinians feel financially strained, underscoring economic messaging as a decisive factor.High Undecided Vote Share: With nearly a quarter to 15% undecided across party lines, there's significant room for jockeying.Long Road Ahead: True clarity will likely emerge post-midterms, once major candidates formally enter the race.While still early in the eight-year presidential cycle, the Emerson College poll in North Carolina underlines evolving allegiances and growing clarity around frontrunners. For Republicans, Vice President Vance is off to a strong start, while Democrats face a more fragmented field. FAQsWhen was the Emerson College poll conducted?The poll was conducted between July 28–30, 2025, surveying 1,000 registered voters in North Carolina.What is the margin of error for the poll? The survey has a ±3 percentage point margin of error.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News on2028 presidential election candidatesJD VanceNorth Carolina pollingKamala HarrisEmerson College PollingRepublican primary votersDemocratic primary votersRon DeSantisPete Buttigieg\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

That’s something that I’m going to benefit from because of the tax bracket that I’m in. But there’s going to be so many people that’s hurt by that bill,' he added. \n\nTrump signed the 'Big, Beautiful Bill', a landmark piece of tax cuts and spending legislation, into law in early July.\n\n'And you know, anything that, you know, takes away Medicaid from people and puts them in a worse financial situation then they were previously in - I'm not for,' Charlamagne, 47, added. \n\nTrump was not happy with the comments the media personality made - prompting him to make a scathing post on his Truth Social platform at 1.49am on Sunday. \n\n'The very wonderful and talented Lara Trump, whose show is a big ratings success, put racist sleazebag Charlamagne “The God” (Why is he allowed to use the word “GOD” when describing himself? Can anyone imagine the uproar there would be if I used that nickname?),' Trump wrote. \n\nThe president then ripped into the radio host, who voted for Kamala, for saying his Democratic presidential opponent is currently looking 'pretty, pretty good.' \n\n'But this dope, Charlamagne, would vote for Sleepy Joe or Kamala? Remember, one year ago our Country was DEAD, now it’s the “HOTTEST” Country anywhere in the World. MAGA!!!,' the commander-in-chief wrote. \n\nHe went on to call Charlamagne a 'Low IQ individual' who doesn't know what he's saying and does not know about the president. \n\n'He’s a Low IQ individual, has no idea what words are coming out of his mouth, and knows nothing about me or what I have done - like just ending 5 Wars, including a 31 year bloodbath between Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, where Seven Million people have died, and there was no end in sight,' Trump added. \n\n'He didn’t know that, or India and Pakistan or, wiping out Iran’s nuclear capabilities, or closing the horrendous open Border, or creating the greatest economy, where prices and Inflation have come way down, and where STUPID and CORRUPT JOE BIDEN set the record for doing the Worst Job as President, EVER.'\n\nDuring the nearly 30 minute interview with Lara, Charlamagne said Americans are disappointed they are not getting the 'day one change' Trump promised during his campaign.\n\n'Right now people are hurting! He campaigned on immediate change. Day one change,' he told her. \n\nLara then asked: 'And you don't think you've felt any change?' \n\n'No,' Charlamagne replied bluntly. \n\nShe then went on to ask him specifically about his feelings on border security and Iran. \n\n'Do you feel safer knowing that Iran will not have the ability to develop a nuclear weapon?,' she asked. \n\n'Sure. If you're telling me that a county won't have the ability to build a nuclear weapon,' Charlamagne responded. \n\nWhen asked if he feels 'better' that American borders are closed, Charlamagne said he does, but he wants to see actual 'criminals and illegal immigrants' being deported, 'Not people who are here trying to go through the process of being in this country legally.' \n\n'When you see people actually getting deported and getting detained and they’re actually trying to go through a process of being American citizens, that’s not right,' he continued. \n\nAlthough he voted for Harris in the 2024 election, Charlmagne is no stranger to lashing out against Democrats.\n\n'When you look at Democrats’ approval rating in this country, when you look at Republicans’ approval rating in this county, you see that America’s just fed up with it all,' he told the Fox News host. \n\n'Like, Democrats suck. We know that already though. You know what I mean? So it’s like…I knew that Trump would probably get in office again and fumble. \n\n'But I also knew that Democrats wouldn’t have the team put together properly to recover the ball. So what you’re seeing right now from the American people is just a backlash to everything. People want something different.'\n\nLara then asked if he thought the former vice president was the 'best representative' for Democrats in the recent election. \n\n'Yes. If you look right now, she's looking pretty, pretty good because a lot of the things that she said President Trump would do, he actually did,' he answered. \n\n'I did a segment on the Daily Show after he became president, and I was like, \"Prove people wrong. Everything that everybody is saying about you, everything that they say you’re going to do, all you gotta do is simply not do.\" But he did it anyway.","summary":"Donald Trump called Charlamagne Tha God a 'racist sleazebag' after the famed radio host criticized the president in front of his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, during her Fox News show.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-14966659/charlamage-tha-god-donald-trump-laura-trump-critisize.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/03/16/100886401-0-image-m-29_1754234423456.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 15:32:17","author":"Editor,Emma Richter","authors":["Editor","Emma Richter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.369},{"id":347811692,"title":"Charlamagne tha God casts doubt on potential Harris 2028 run, urges Dems to throw 'old regime' under the bus","text":"Radio host Charlamagne Tha God threw some cold water on the idea of former Vice President Kamala Harris running for president in 2028, and urged the Democratic Party to throw the old regime \"under the bus.\" \"I don't personally know if I would run for president, if I was her, and, if she does, she has to get a real connection with the people.

While politicos are keenly watching Harris for her next moves, she's also being eyed by House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., who is investigating whether top Biden administration officials covered up evidence of a mental decline in former President Joe Biden. Comer all but guaranteed his committee would be contacting Harris during an appearance on \"The Ingraham Angle\" last week. He joined Fox News Channel just after Harris announced she would not be running for governor of California, as some have speculated, and will instead embark on a listening tour to hear from Americans and try to boost fellow Democrats across the country. \"I think that that’s another great thing about Kamala Harris not running for governor – she’s gonna have more time to come before the House Oversight Committee and testify about Joe Biden’s cognitive decline,\" Comer said. \"So I think that the odds of Kamala Harris getting a subpoena are very high.\" COMER DISMISSES BIDEN DOCTOR'S BID FOR PAUSE IN COVER-UP PROBE: 'THROWING OUT EVERY EXCUSE' During a recent appearance on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" Harris distanced herself from any immediate electoral ambitions. She emphasized she wanted to hear from all voters, however, not necessarily ruling out a future presidential run. \"I believe, and I always believed, that as fragile as our democracy is, our systems would be strong enough to defend our most fundamental principles. And I think right now that, they're not as strong as they need to be,\" Harris said. \"And I just don't want to for now, I don't want to go back in the system. I want to, I want to travel the country. I want to listen to people. I want to talk with people. And I don't want it to be transactional, where I'm asking for their vote.\" RON KLAIN DODGES REPORTERS AFTER MARATHON GRILLING IN BIDEN COVER-UP PROBE Jonathan Turley, a Fox News contributor and professor at George Washington University Law School, told Fox News Digital the optics of a congressional subpoena would be less than ideal for a potential 2028 candidate. \"This is a tough question for Harris, who clearly has aspirations to run again,\" Turley said when asked if he would advise Harris to appear. \"The committee can compel her to appear. However, the optics of forcing a subpoena are not exactly optimal for someone who wants to run again for this office.\" He added, however, that Harris would be a \"natural\" target for Comer's probe. \"Harris held a unique spot within the inner circle of the White House,\" Turley said. But both he and former House Oversight Committee ChairTrey Gowdy, R-S.C., now a Fox News Channel host, were doubtful that bringing Harris in would yield much new information. \"Is it worth investigating? Absolutely. Is it worth getting her take on it? Yeah. Is she going to cooperate? No,\" Gowdy told Fox News Digital. The former South Carolina congressman, who also served as a federal prosecutor, predicted that Harris' lawyers would seek to bury any potential appearance in a quagmire of legal proceedings stemming from executive and/or presidential privilege claims. \"That privilege has been invoked by both parties repeatedly during congressional investigations,\" Gowdy said. \"Leaving the names out of it, just for the sake of an analogy, I can't think of an advisor that would be closer to a president than his or her vice president. So, by the time you're litigating the issue of whether or not you can compel a vice president to talk about conversations that he or she had with a chief of staff, with a spouse, with the president, with the president's physician – you'll be as old as I am by the time that's litigated.\" Turley said House investigators would have to be armed with \"specific\" questions to avoid someone like Harris being able to answer with \"a matter of opinion.\" Gowdy agreed Harris was a \"legitimate\" witness to bring in and that the issue of Biden's autopen use, particularly for pardons, \"warrants further scrutiny.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He warned, however, that a potent subpoena comes with consequences for noncompliance. \"Prosecutors can send cops and have [people] brought in. Congress can't do that. Judges can send the marshals or the sheriff's deputies out to bring a witness in if the witness is recalcitrant. Congress can't do that,\" Gowdy said. \"So your power is only as good as what you can do to enforce it.\" A spokesperson for Biden declined to comment on Comer's subpoena threat when reached by Fox News Digital.

Given her name ID, she would have been the front-runner to replace Gavin Newsom whatever her merits and demerits. The race had been effectively on hold awaiting her decision—and now other candidates can get moving.\n\nAs senator, Harris governed as a mainstream liberal. As AG, she largely held a finger in the wind. She often did the bidding of the police unions—and then tried to depict herself as a progressive criminal-justice reformer when that looked like a winning position. We found her tiresome. We would have expected Harris’ governorship to be similar to Newsom’s—not a compliment.\n\nWith its myriad problems—a homelessness and housing crisis, crumbling infrastructure, wildfire and water challenges—California is desperately in need of innovative, market-oriented ideas. Harris would not have provided them, but the remaining field doesn’t inspire much confidence. The primary is in June, so kudos to Harris for providing time for a boisterous race.\n\nAttention will focus on the Democratic candidates, as no Republican has won the governorship (or any statewide office) since Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006. GOP statewide candidates are lucky to break 40%. With the top-two primary, it’s not even a certainly a Republican will make it into the general election.\n\nThe Democratic field is, to put it kindly, underwhelming. Candidates include establishment figures, ideologues and has-beens. Of the former, there’s Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, Controller Betty Yee and former legislative leader Toni Atkins. Kounalakis and Yee haven’t established any distinctive positions. Atkins is progressive, but with a reputation for personal graciousness. Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond is a mouthpiece for teachers’ unions.\n\nIn the has-been camp, there’s former AG Xavier Becerra and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Becerra was a constant embarrassment and mouthpiece for police unions. Villaraigosa took some praiseworthy positions, such as his support for educational choice, but a lot has changed since he was a political powerhouse.\n\nKatie Porter, the former Orange County representative, is the field’s highest-profile ideologue. Every Democrat will promote high tax, big-government policies. It’s a matter of degree, with Porter likely to be the most aggressive in, say, embracing single-payer healthcare and “battling” corporate interests.\n\nOne interesting possibility: Los Angeles developer Rick Caruso, who spent $100 million on a losing race for LA mayor, has indicated interest in running again for office. He hasn’t declared his intentions, but is a moderate Republican-turned-independent-turned Democrat. He is focused on nuts-and-bolts reform issues and stayed in the limelight highlighting LA’s wildfire failures. He has deep pockets, which can help him compete. We see echoes of the late Richard Riordan, a businessman who served as a competent LA mayor.\n\nThere’s still time for new voices to emerge to shake up the race. California certainly can use them.","summary":"There’s still time for new voices to emerge to shake up the race.

The next closest candidate was Rick Caruso (9%), who was not even in double digits.\n\nQuite simply, the race for California’s next Governor is entirely up for grabs, a shocking development less than one year from the primary.\n\nZooming out, with California set to host the World Cup, the next two Super Bowls, and the 2028 Summer Olympics, the eyes of the country, and indeed the world, will be on the Golden State. \n\nWhoever is in charge at the state and local level will have a tremendous impact on the future of the state, health of California’s economy, and more.\n\nThe first shoe to fall for Bass were the devastating wildfires that rocked Los Angeles, for which Bass was widely harangued.\n\nStarting with criticism for being out of the country when the fires began, Bass then attempted to pin the blame on fire chief Kristin Crowley, angering the firefighters union as well as people deeply sympathetic to the firefighters’ heroic efforts to battle the blazes.\n\nThen in the spring, Los Angeles reported a $1 billion budget shortfall which City Controller Kenneth Mejia reportedly told Bass – as far back as least 2023 – was due to chronic overspending, not the fires.\n\nLos Angeles and its Mayor were back in the national spotlight again earlier this summer, when protests against immigration enforcement rocked the city. \n\nPresident Trump arguably exacerbated the issue by bringing in U.S. Marines and 4,000 National Guard members, but all of it contributed to a feeling that Bass was simply not up for the job – something reflected in polls. \n\nIndeed, on the eve of the November 2022 elections, a U.C. Berkeley poll found that one-half of LA residents had a favorable view of Bass, versus slightly more than one-third (35%) who had unfavorable views.\n\nThat same poll conducted this May revealed almost a complete reversal. Now, just 32% of Angelenos held a favorable view of the Mayor, while 50% viewed her unfavorably. \n\nBass’ growing vulnerability may open the door for an actual contender. \n\nPerhaps her 2022 opponent Rick Caruso wants a rematch, and there has been speculation about county Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, although Horvath “would position herself to the left of the mayor” thus is likely fighting an uphill battle.\n\nCould Caruso pose a credible challenge? \n\nThe businessman, who spent more than $40 million of his own money, and more than $100 million overall, before ultimately losing by nearly 10-points, received a considerable amount of positive coverage for his efforts during the fires, and he may try to capitalize on that. \n\nTo that end, Caruso has publicly attacked Bass over rebuilding and homelessness in recent months, potentially laying the groundwork for a renewed challenge, although he’s remained mum.\n\nOf course, he’d have to overcome one of the biggest issues from the 2022 campaign – perceptions that he remains a Republican and only became a Democrat for political expediency. \n\nThen there’s Gavin Newsom, whose national ambitions have been among politics’ worst kept secrets.\n\nAfter a bump in his polls earlier this year coinciding with the LA fires and opposition to Trump, sentiment has turned against his handling of the state. \n\nJust 3-in-10 Californians believe the state is on the “right track” versus 60% – including nearly two-thirds (64%) of Independents – who say the state is headed in the wrong direction, per UC Irvine.\n\nAnd while this has taken a toll on Newsom’s approval ratings – just 38% – there is a very real chance that it also impacts both Newsom’s successor, as well as his presidential ambitions. \n\nHarris’ decision not to run has certainly opened the door for other contenders like Caruso or Porter, but both have their challenges, and neither may be influential enough to push through policies the state desperately needs.\n\nWith that in mind, Newsom’s declining popularity, combined with increasing pessimism at the state’s current politicians may reverberate throughout the ballot. \n\nThe same UC Irvine poll showed that California Republicans remain deeply supportive of Trump and the GOP. \n\nRoughly one-quarter of California’s voters are Republican – an increase of a few hundred thousand voters since 2020 – which could be enough to force a runoff between Porter and Caruso, particularly if Republicans feel that he is the most viable candidate close enough to the GOP. \n\nIf that seems unlikely, consider the race to replace Sen. Dianne Feinstein, where Republican Steve Garvey advanced to the runoff against now-Senator Adam Schiff. \n\nOn a much smaller scale, this right-ward shift has shown up in San Francisco and in the 2024 election, yet it’s unclear to what extent there will be follow through in the 2026 elections.\n\nUltimately, as the nation’s largest and richest state, California politics remain worth watching, even if the state writ large can hardly be considered a barometer of the national electorate.\n\nThis is even more so given the aforementioned national and international events coming to the Golden State, for which the next mayor of LA and governor will be responsible for overseeing. \n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"California politics remain worth watching, even if the state writ large can hardly be considered a barometer of the national electorate.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/08/03/california-politics-are-interesting-again/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LDN-L-CARUSO-VILLAGE-07-0529-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 14:00:56","author":"Douglas Schoen","authors":["Douglas Schoen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":347803118,"title":"How California governor race is shaking out without Kamala Harris","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris kept the race for California governor on hold. Her potential presence had that much influence.\n\nHarris, however, put an end to any thoughts of her running to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom last week.\n\nIn the process, she essentially set all the other candidates in motion to grab momentum and establish themselves atop the pack of hopefuls.\n\nAlready, there is no shortage of candidates who have launched gubernatorial bids. The field includes a diverse array of contenders — in terms of backgrounds and experiences — especially among Democrats.\n\nBut without Harris, at this stage in the campaign, there is no clear frontrunner in the race, political experts said.\n\n“This is the most wide-open governor’s race that California has seen in modern history,” said Dan Schnur, who teaches political messaging at USC and UC Berkeley. “There is no precedent in the digital era, or even in the time since cable television was invented, that there has been such a lack of a clear frontrunner.”\n\nStill, Harris’ decision to stay away from the race has given some candidates a bit of a momentum boost.\n\nFormer Rep. Katie Porter’s campaign said she raised more than $250,000 in the 36 hours following Harris’ announcement. The Orange County Democrat’s campaign has sent out a bevy of fundraising emails in recent days, tying Porter’s record to Harris’ and sharing polling from March that shows her leading the field of Democrats without the former vice president in consideration.\n\nAnd there’s Xavier Becerra, who, without Harris, can boast the most executive branch experience in the field. Becerra, with a long resume in California politics, served as the U.S. health secretary during the Biden administration.\n\nStill, other candidates have more experience getting elected to statewide offices: Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis (who got some recent praise from former Speaker Nancy Pelosi), State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond and former Controller Betty Yee.\n\nBut at this stage, there is no candidate who can say it’s their race to lose, experts said.\n\nAnd that means there’s an opportunity voters could see a real competition play out in the race for governor, particularly among Democrats, said Matt Lesenyie, an expert in California politics who teaches at Cal State Long Beach.\n\nSo in the meantime, there are a few storylines politicos are considering as the race unfolds.\n\nPathway for Republicans\n\nSince 2012, the top two vote-getters in California primary races for certain state and federal offices, including governor, have advanced to the general election, despite the political parties.\n\nEven so, California voters have picked one Democrat and one Republican to move to the general election for governor every time.\n\n“In the open primary era, Republicans have gotten very good at getting a candidate in the top two in the spring, and then they’ve gotten very good at losing in the fall,” said Schnur, adding, “It’s unlikely we’ll see either of those trends changing.”\n\nDemocrats will certainly need to keep that in mind as the contest among their candidates heats up, said Sarah Hill, who teaches political science at Cal State Fullerton.\n\n“What Democrats can do is split their votes so much that if Republicans only have a couple of people seriously running, they could easily get more votes and sneak into the general election,” Hill said. “The party is going to have to pay attention and pretty quickly signal to voters who they should focus on.”\n\nRepublicans, thus far, have Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News host Steve Hilton vying for the race.\n\nBianco’s campaign this week boasted strong fundraising numbers, while Hilton’s boasted his travels to various counties around California.\n\nBoth celebrated Harris’ news that she was staying out of the race, but did so by criticizing her past leadership in various elected offices in California.\n\nPorter’s next steps\n\nWhile hesitant to call her a flat-out frontrunner, several experts said Porter has certainly emerged at the head of the crowded field.\n\n“If Katie Porter ends up becoming the governor, it’s going to be because of what she does at this point going forward, not because of what she’s done up until now,” said Schnur.\n\nA progressive darling known for going toe-to-toe with large corporations during her congressional tenure, Porter embraced that “Bernie Sanders” wing of the party during her recent, unsuccessful bid for U.S. Senate, Schnur noted.\n\n“She’s already established herself as a very strong anti-Trump progressive voice. The question is whether she’s able to develop or articulate a broader message in this campaign than she did last year,” said Schnur.\n\n“That doesn’t mean she needs to become more moderate, but rather that she needs to find a way to appeal to more moderate voters,” he said.\n\nPorter has established a bit of a unique brand, said Cal State Long Beach’s Lesenyie. He said she should keep a similar identity — a working mom who understands the price of groceries — rather than change completely if she wants to be successful this go-round.\n\n“I wouldn’t give that up,” he said. “That would be like telling McDonald’s to change the recipe.”\n\nA diverse pipeline\n\nSomething else about the field of gubernatorial candidates, rather than the lack of a clear frontrunner, stuck out to Hill: a lack of White men running.\n\n“It’s almost all women and/or people of color who are running,” Hill pointed out. “Are we finally going to have something different?”\n\nIs it time, she said, for California to choose its first female governor?\n\n“That’s really interesting if you look at the very diverse pipeline that the Democratic Party has been building up over the last 15 years,” she said.\n\nBut the diverse field could complicate some candidates, said Schnur, pointing specifically to Becerra and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.\n\n“Villaraigosa and Becerra are much more complicated candidates than their identity alone,” Schnur said, “but it’s no question that two prominent Latinos in the race make it harder for both of them.”\n\nEither one has the ability to propel to the front of the gubernatorial pack, Schnur said, “but it’s going to be much harder for them as long as the other is in the race.”\n\n‘Schwarzenegger effect’\n\nIn 2003, California voters recalled Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, replacing him with a Republican who had very little political experience but very high name ID: movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nThe campaign was only 11 weeks.\n\nThe current gubernatorial race is ripe for another similar situation, “the Schwarzenegger effect,” said Lesenyie.\n\n“If I were any of those candidates, I’d be worried that a celebrity, a George Clooney, jumps in, who has no experience but has instant name recognition and can self-fund their campaign.”\n\nThe uncertainty shrouding the California governor race is exciting, at least for some.\n\n“As political scientists, it’s fun,” said Hill. “This is what we like to watch.”","summary":"Is it Katie Porter's race to lose?

The president repeatedly drifts off topic, including during a cabinet meeting this month when he spent 15 minutes talking about decorating, and appears to misremember simple facts about his government and his life.\n\nDuring his presidency, Joe Biden was subjected to intense speculation over his mental acuity – including from Trump. After Biden’s disastrous debate performance in June 2024, when he repeatedly struggled to maintain his train of thought, scrutiny over Biden’s fitness eventually led to him not running for re-election.\n\nTrump, however, has largely been saved the same examination, despite examples of confusion and unusual behavior that have continued throughout his second term and were on full display on his recent trip to the UK.\n\nOver the weekend Trump, during a meeting with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, abruptly switched from discussing immigration to saying this: “The other thing I say to Europe: ​we’ve – we will not allow a windmill to be built in the United States​. They’re killing us. They’re killing the beauty of our scenery.”\n\nTrump proceeded to speak, non-stop and unprompted, for two minutes about windmills, claiming without evidence that they drive whales “loco” and that wind energy “kills the birds” (the proportion of birds killed by turbines is tiny compared with the amount killed by domestic cats and from flying into power lines).\n\nThe abrupt changes in conversation are an example of Trump “digressing without thinking – he’ll just switch topics without self-regulation, without having a coherent narrative”, said Harry Segal, a senior lecturer in the psychology department at Cornell University and in the psychiatry department at Weill Cornell Medicine.\n\nFor years, Trump has batted away questions about his mental acuity, describing himself as a “stable genius” and bragging about “acing” exams – later revealed to be very simple tests – which check for early signs of dementia.\n\nBut Democrats have begun to more aggressively question the president’s fitness, including Jasmine Crockett, the representative from Texas, and California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, and this week alone offered multiple examples of Trump exhibiting odd conduct.\n\nAsked about the famine in Gaza on Sunday, Trump seemed unable to remember the aid the US has given to Gaza, and forget that others had also contributed.\n\nTrump claimed the US gave $60m “two weeks ago”. He added: “​You really at least want to have somebody say thank you. No other country gave anything.\n\n“Nobody acknowledged it, nobody talks about it and it makes you feel a little bad when you do that and you know you have other countries not giving anything, none of the European countries ​by the way gave – I mean nobody gave but us.”\n\nTrump seemed to not realize or remember that other countries have given money to Gaza – the UK announced a £60m ($80m) package in July, and the European Union has allocated €170m ($195m) in aid. And the Guardian could not find any record of the US giving $60m to Gaza two weeks ago. In June, the US state department approved a $30m grant to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a group backed by Israeli and US interests which has been criticized by Democrats as “connected to deadly violence against starving people seeking food in Gaza”.\n\nThe White House did not respond to questions about Trump’s claimed $60m donation.\n\nSegal said another characteristic of Trump’s questionable mental acuity is confabulation. “It’s where he takes an idea or something that’s happened and he adds to it things that have not happened.”\n\nA high-profile example came in mid-July, when Trump claimed his uncle, the late professor John Trump, had taught Ted Kaczynski, better known as the Unabomber, at MIT.\n\nTrump recalled: “I said: ‘What kind of a student was he, Uncle John? Dr John Trump.’ I said: ‘What kind of a student?’ And then he said: ‘Seriously, good.’ He said: ‘He’d correct – he’d go around correcting everybody.’ But it didn’t work out too well for him.”\n\nThe problem is: that cannot possibly be true. First, Trump’s uncle died in 1985, and Kaczynski was only publicly identified as the Unabomber in 1996. Second, Kaczynski did not study at MIT.\n\n“The story makes no sense whatsoever, but it’s told in a very warm, reflective way, as if he’s remembering it,” Segal said. “This level of thinking really has been deteriorating.”\n\nAside from the confabulation, there have been times when Trump seems unable to focus. During the 2024 campaign there was the bizarre sight of Trump spending 40 minutes swaying to music onstage after a medical emergency at one of his campaign rallies. Trump’s rambling speeches during his campaign – he would frequently drift between topics in a technique he described as “the weave” – also drew scrutiny.\n\nThe White House removed official transcripts of Trump’s remarks from its website in May, claiming it was part of an effort to “maintain consistency”. It is worth reading Trump’s remarks in full, however, to get a sense of how the president speaks on a day-to-day basis.\n\nAt the beginning of July, Trump was asked, “What is the next campaign promise that you plan to fulfill to the American people?” He then rambled about meeting foreign leaders and removing regulations, adding:\n\n I got rid of – just one I got rid of the other night, you buy a house, they have a faucet in the house, Joe, and the faucet the water doesn’t come out. They have a restrictor. You can’t – in areas where you have so much water they don’t know what to do with it. Uh, you have a shower head the shower doesn’t uh, the shower doesn’t, you think it’s not working. It is working. The water’s dripping out and that’s no good for me. I like this hair lace and [sic] – I like that hair nice and wet. Takes you – you have to stand in the shower for 20 minutes before you get the soap out of your hair. And I put a, a thing – and it sounds funny but it’s really not. It’s horrible. And uh, when you wash your hands, you turn on the faucet, no water comes out. You’re washing whole – water barely comes out it’s ridi – this was done by crazy people. And I wor – wrote it all off and got it approved in Congress so that they can’t just change it.”\n\n“Any fair-minded mental-health expert would be very worried about Donald Trump’s performance,” Richard A Friedman, a professor of clinical psychiatry and the director of the psychopharmacology clinic at Weill Cornell Medical College, wrote in the Atlantic, after a stumbling performance from Trump in his debate against Kamala Harris last September.\n\nHe added: “If a patient presented to me with the verbal incoherence, tangential thinking, and repetitive speech that Trump now regularly demonstrates, I would almost certainly refer them for a rigorous neuropsychiatric evaluation to rule out a cognitive illness.”\n\nAt a recent cabinet meeting called to discuss the flooding tragedy in Texas, the war in Ukraine and Gaza, the bombing of Iran, and global tariffs, Trump went on a 13-minute monologue about how he had decorated the cabinet meeting room.\n\nAfter talking about paintings which he said he had personally selected from “the vaults”, Trump said. “Look at those frames, you know, I’m a frame person, sometimes I like frames more than I like the pictures,” and added he had overseen the cleaning of some china.\n\nAs department heads, including the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, waited to be dismissed so they could go and do their jobs, Trump continued:\n\n Here we put out – you know these, these lamps have been very important actually, whether people love them or not but they’re if you see pictures like Pearl Harbor or Tora! Tora! Tora!, you see movies about the White House where wars are being discussed, oftentimes they’ll show those lamps or something like those lamps, something that looks like them. Probably not the reals, because I don’t think they’re allowed to – this is a very important room, this is a sacred room, and I don’t think they made movies from here.\n You never know what they do. But they were missing, er, medallions. See the medallions on top? They had a chain going into the ceiling. And I said: ‘You can’t do that. You have to have a medallion.’ They said, ‘What’s a medallion?’ I said: ‘I’ll show you.’ And then we got some beautiful medallions, and you see them, they were put up there, makes the lamps look [inaudible] so we did these changes.\n And when you think of it, the cost was almost nothing. We also painted the room a nice color, beige color, and it’s been really something. The only question is, will I gold-leaf the corners? You could maybe tell me. My cabinet could take a vote. You see the top-line moldings, and the only question is do you go and leaf it? Because you can’t paint it, if you paint it it won’t look good because they’ve never found a paint that looks like gold. You see that in the Oval Office.\n Er, they’ve tried for years and years. Somebody could become very wealthy, but they’ve never found a paint that looks like gold. So painting is easy but it won’t look right.”\n\nThe White House pushes back aggressively on the issue of Trump’s mental fitness.\n\n“The Guardian is a left-wing mouthpiece that should be embarrassed to pass off deranged resistance leftists as ‘experts’. Anyone pathetic enough to defend Biden’s mental state – while being labeled as unethical by their peers – has zero credibility. President Trump’s mental sharpness is second to none and he is working around the clock to secure amazing deals for the American people,” said White House spokesperson Liz Huston.\n\nSo do his political allies. “As President Trump’s former personal physician, former physician to the president, and White House physician for 14 years across three administrations, I can tell you unequivocally: President Donald J Trump is the healthiest president this nation has ever seen. I continue to consult with his current physician and medical team at the White House and still spend significant time with the president. He is mentally and physically sharper than ever before,” said congressman Ronny Jackson.\n\nIn April, Trump’s White House physician, Dr Sean Barbabella, wrote that the president “exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the commander-in-chief and head of state”. He said Trump was assessed for cognitive function, which was normal.\n\nThat report hasn’t stopped people from questioning Trump’s mental acuity.\n\n“What we see are the classic signs of dementia, which is gross deterioration from someone’s baseline and function,” John Gartner, a psychologist and author who spent 28 years as an assistant professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University Medical School, said in June.\n\n“If you go back and look at film from the 1980s, [Trump] actually was extremely articulate. He was still a jerk, but he was able to express himself in polished paragraphs, and now he really has trouble completing a thought and that is a huge deterioration.”\n\nGartner, who during Trump’s first term co-founded Duty to Warn, a group of mental health professionals who believed Trump had the personality disorder malignant narcissism, warned: “I predicted before the election that he would probably fall off the cliff before the end of his term. And at the rate he is deteriorating, you know … we’ll see.\n\n“But the point is that it’s going to get worse. That’s my prediction.”","summary":"Joe Biden was hounded for his age-related gaffes, but Trump’s increasingly strange behavior has largely been ignored\n\nDonald Trump’s frequently bizarre public appearances, which this month have seen the president claim, wrongly, that his uncle knew the Unabomber and rant unprompted about windmills on his recent trip to the UK, have once again raised questions about his mental acuity, experts say.\n\nFor more than a year Trump, 79, has exhibited odd behavior at campaign events, in interviews, in his spontaneous remarks and at press conferences. The president repeatedly drifts off topic, including during a cabinet meeting this month when he spent 15 minutes talking about decorating, and appears to misremember simple facts about his government and his life.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/03/donald-trump-mental-fitness","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf2ff42f5ad56a866a0de0bda1a35b7dcc53c4c/0_0_2399_1920/master/2399.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 14:00:42","author":"Adam Gabbatt","authors":["Adam Gabbatt"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.028},{"id":347777988,"title":"Latest line: A good week for High Speed Rail CEO, a bad week for home insurance buyers","text":"Ian Choudri\n\nCalifornia High Speed Rail Authority CEO who took the helm of the overdue and overbudget bullet train project a year ago gets encouraging signs from lawmakers and potential investors for his idea to pursue rail extensions to the Los Angeles and Bay Area metro centers alongside the current Central Valley segment work.\n\nHome insurance customers\n\nCalifornia’s effort to prod insurers to sell more policies and get homeowners in fire risk areas off the state’s pricey last-resort plan is progressing, but slowly, and higher premiums are likely in store after January’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires.\n\nKamala Harris\n\nFormer Democratic vice president who lost the 2024 presidential race to Republican Donald Trump forgoes a run for state governor that polls suggested she’d easily win, but leaves open possibility of a third run for president in 2028.","summary":"High Speed Rail CEO gets encouraging signs on bid to extend Central Valley route to Bay Area.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/03/latest-line-a-good-week-for-high-speed-rail-ceo-a-bad-week-for-home-insurance-buyers/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SJM-L-CARAIL-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 13:30:28","author":"Bay Area News Group","authors":["Bay Area News Group"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.133},{"id":347777984,"title":"They said it: Former veep passes on run for governor","text":"“For now, my leadership — and public service — will not be in elected office.”\n\n— Kamala Harris, former Democratic vice president who lost 2024 presidential race to Republican Donald Trump, on declining a run for California governor in 2026 that polls suggested she’d win.","summary":"Quote of the week.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/03/they-said-it-former-veep-passes-on-run-for-governor/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Election_2026_Governor_Harris_73525.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 13:15:59","author":"Bay Area News Group","authors":["Bay Area News Group"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":347788758,"title":"Don't be fooled. Mamdani isn't the future of the Democratic Party. These two patriotic women are","text":"It has been over a year since President Joe Biden made one of the hardest decisions in political history and announced that he would not seek re-election. Since that day, and the day that Vice President Harris’s lost in November, the Democratic Party has been in a full-blown identity crisis. We started a full-blown autopsy, we started looking for new messages, new leaders, new formats, and new language. We are investing millions to \"study\" how to connect with male voters. The holy grail is \"authenticity,\" which means speak like a normal human. (That includes curse words, which bodes well for this New Yorker—swearing is our native tongue.) We are listening to anyone who says they have the secret formula. That is why, when Zohran Mamdani energized young voters in NYC, everyone, especially the media, turned their attention to him. He capitalized on anger and frustration with inaction in Washington, connected with voters' concerns about affordability, and used social media masterfully, running rings around his older, squarer opponents. He was hip, and he was \"real.\" But all the hyperventilating is premature. Mamdani won a multi-candidate Democratic primary in a deep blue city, held on a 100-degree day in June. He received less than 600,000 votes in a city of over 8 million. So, let’s not let social media tell us that he is the future of the Democratic Party. I’m a NYC Democrat and I don’t remember anyone outside of the five boroughs caring what Mayor Bloomberg, DiBlasio, or Adams did on the national level. KAMALA HARRIS DECISION NOT TO RUN IN 2026 OPENS DOOR TO POSSIBLE SECOND PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN 2028 If you are a Democrat running anywhere outside of the blue bubble cities, and especially if you’re trying to flip a seat from red to blue, you cast your gaze across the Hudson and south for the blueprint you need. Hop on Amtrak and disembark in Trenton, New Jersey or Richmond, Virginia, and the answer will be right in front of you. What you will see are two candidates who have national security credentials that would let Democrats win back the patriotic and military voters because they can walk the walk, not just talk it like Republicans have in the past. What you will see are candidates that have proven bipartisan track records in Congress of getting shit done. These two candidates are Mikie Sherill and Abigail Spanberger. They are real and authentic. They are what would be created if liberals and moderates, swing voters and suburban moms, young men and military hawks, and values-based, pragmatic Democrats with national appeal all gave their input to ChatGPT. These are two women Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., could campaign with, and Sen. Joe Manchin, my former boss, could work with. To quote Mr Mamdani, we should learn how to say their names because we have to get it right. DEMOCRATS ARE STILL LOST BUT ONE YEAR AFTER BIDEN'S EXIT, THEY'RE STARTING TO FOLLOW A RIVAL'S ROADMAP So why aren’t they being elevated as the future or blueprint for success? Don’t tell me it’s because they haven’t won their general elections yet. That has never stopped us before. I’m old enough to remember Howard Dean and Beto O’Rourke being crowned as saviors of the left before they won anything. I’ve read \"What’s the Matter with Kansas?\" I’m familiar with the Abundance movement. I’m not knocking any of them. But let’s be honest: we’ve gone looking for answers in far less proven places. Maybe it’s gender. Maybe we have a harder time seeing two tough, competent, patriotic women as the leaders who could rebuild our Party’s coalition. If you look at their records and accomplishments, they’ve walked the walk, many of their male colleagues just talk about. They’re not fantasy candidates. They’re not focus-group fabrications. They’re real leaders with real records, with national security credentials, bipartisan chops, and electoral success in places that aren’t easy for Democrats. They appeal to swing voters, military families, independents, union members, and suburban moderates—all the people we keep saying we need to win back. And they did it without changing who they are, bending to the winds of polling or message-tested language. They did it by being who they have been since they were first elected in 2018.

In Congress, she passed bipartisan legislation to prevent fentanyl overdoses, allowed Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices, and put more cops on the streets of local cities. Mikie served 10 years as a Naval helicopter pilot and led missions throughout Europe and the Middle East.

When I pulled up to the brand-new Erewhon in Manhattan Beach, one woman was filming her review of a $20 smoothie and another was taste-testing an expensive assortment of healthy prepared sides including something called “killer cauliflower.” The scene gave me pause. I love supermarkets, but not the fancy ones. I grew up in the air-conditioned, processed-food comfort of Ralphs and Vons and remain a sucker for anything flavored with nacho cheese, sour cream and onion, sweet sriracha, honey mustard and cool ranch. But when Erewhon opened a short drive from the L.A. Times newsroom, I was immediately curious. Could I find my own particular food paradise at a place described as \"Hollywood's cult-favorite wellness location,\" \"L.A.'s hottest hangout,\" \"Whole Foods on steroids,\" and the \"VIP of grocery stores.\" I was about to find out. In a city where deceptive brand building and selective narratives are a way of life, I’ve always found the supermarket the one place that reduces me to ground truths. It is here where the person I tell people I am collides with the person I actually am, the moment my cart merges into the checkout stand. I can talk all I want about lavish salads, a broiled piece of salmon, grain bowls, and the latest La Croix flavor. But the supermarket scanner records the real story: the teriyaki pita chips, fatty porterhouse steaks and premium ice cream bars that bring me such pleasure but always go publicly unspoken. During the pandemic, my local Ralphs became an unlikely refuge. I roamed the aisles to collect steps as a break from the crushing news cycle. Wearing a mask was an added bonus, gliding through the self-checkout scanner with some guilt-reducing anonymity. When I am stressed or down or lonely, I often head to the store to clear my head. Sometimes, my mood improves and I exit with 2,500 steps and not a single item. Other times, it ends with a bag of junk food I hope will do the job. The Pavillons in West Hollywood was my first market as an adult. I was 400 pounds and well into a lifetime cycle of diets. A sturdy metal shopping cart served as my walker, allowing me to get through the store faster than if I was struggling to walk on my own. My first stop was to the produce section, collecting a few heads of lettuce and bags of carrots and celery. Then I did the real shopping — cookies, bread, butter, frozen dinners, chips, lunch meats. The vegetables served as a cover: I hid the junk food beneath it. This charade was costly, because the vegetables would always go into the trash can the minute I got home. Flowing receipts could tell you so much about my life: The optimism of a New Year’s diet in January, the excesses to chase away the holiday blues in December. By the time I entered Erewhon, I’d overcome some of those hangups. I don’t care as much about what the shopper passing me in the cereal aisle thinks of what she sees in my cart. I criss-crossed the aisles taking mental notes, debating whether any of the organic fare would appeal to me. Definitely not the “killer cauliflower.” The lack of all my familiar corporate logos and packaging momentarily rattled me. So many items are sold in cute glass mason jars. But the closer I looked at those jars, the more comfortable I became. Some contained olives, dried figs, kale soup, overnight oats and small-batch kimchi. But there were just as many made for me: Biscotti studded with nuts, macaroons dipped in dark chocolate, chocolate-covered almonds mixed with pistachios. Erewon was far from the eat-your-organic-spinach place I expected. I grabbed a jar of macaroons and another of dried mangos and headed for the checkout, which was lined with individual wrapped brownies, cookies, power bars and other sweet baked goods. I’ll definitely be back. With Kamala Harris out, the candidates for governor are trying to position themselves as the front runner, even though polling shows most voters remain undecided. Still, some political observers give the nod to former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, who appears to have a small leg up over her opponents.Others say naming a front runner at this stage is \"ludicrous.\" With such a wide-open field, factors such as endorsements and communication strategies will be important to watch, experts said.

(AP) — An independent watchdog agency responsible for enforcing a law against partisan political activity by federal employees has opened an investigation into Jack Smith, the Justice Department special counsel who brought two criminal cases against then-candidate Donald Trump before his election to the White House last year.\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel confirmed Saturday that it was investigating Smith on allegations he engaged in political activity through his inquiries into Trump. Smith was named special counsel by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 and his special counsel title is entirely distinct from the agency now investigating him. The office has no criminal enforcement power but does have the authority to impose fines and other sanctions for violations.\n\nIt was not clear what basis exists to contend that Smith’s investigations were political in nature or that he violated the Hatch Act, a federal law that bans certain public officials from engaging in political activity. Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, had earlier this week encouraged the office to scrutinize Smith’s activities and had alleged that his conduct was designed to help then-President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, both Democrats.\n\nSmith brought two cases against Trump, one accusing him of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and the other of hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both were brought in 2023, well over a year before the 2024 presidential election, and indictments in the two cases cited what Smith and his team described as clear violations of well-established federal law. Garland has repeatedly said politics played no part in the handling of the cases.\n\nBoth cases were abandoned by Smith after Trump’s November win, with the prosecutor citing longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting the indictment of a sitting president.\n\nThere was no immediate indication that the same office investigating Smith had opened investigations into the Justice Department special counsels who were appointed by Garland to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nThe White House had no immediate comment on the investigation into Smith, which was first reported by The New York Post.\n\nThe office has been riven by leadership tumult over the last year. An earlier chief, Hampton Dellinger, was abruptly fired by the Trump administration and initially sued to get his job back before abandoning the court fight.\n\nTrump selected as his replacement Paul Ingrassia, a former right-wing podcast host who has praised criminally charged influencer Andrew Tate as an “extraordinary human being” and promoted the false claim that the 2020 election was rigged. A Senate panel was set to consider his nomination at a hearing last month, but it was pulled from the agenda.\n\nTrump’s trade representative, Jamieson Greer, is serving as acting head of the office.\n\nTucker reported from Washington.","summary":"Jack Smith was named special counsel by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022.\n\n\nThe post Ex-Trump prosecutor faces investigation by independent political watchdog appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2025/08/03/ex-trump-prosecutor-faces-investigation-by-independent-political-watchdog/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Trump_25953-688e70e4b947a-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 12:28:29","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.234},{"id":347767234,"title":"Stephen A.

Smith claims Trump's Redskins demand is a distraction from Epstein scandal\n\n'When you were campaigning on behalf of the former Vice President Kamala Harris, you said a vote for Trump was a vote against you and a vote against y’all as women. I want to say for the record - I took major offense to that.\n\n'I think to this day that is the only thing that I didn’t like that you said, I didn’t appreciate it. Because there’s so many things that go into deciding where your vote is going to go.\n\n'For some people, it’s all about the economy. For others, it’s all about national security. For some people, it is immigration. For some people, it’s safety in the streets of America. Long before they think about pro-choice or pro-life.'\n\nSmith then briefly praised Obama after branding her 'sensational' and claiming that both she and husband Barack would beat Trump in an election if either of them decide to run in the future.\n\nHe then addressed her comments about ESPN, which he 'respectfully disagreed' with after hearing the comparison to the Real Housewives. \n\n'So this doesn’t have anything to do with what you were talking about, how sports and reality TV mirror one another, even though we would beg to differ,' the ESPN host continued. 'Because a lot of things on reality TV are made-up situations and scenarios to provoke reactions and all of that stuff.\n\n'We’re at sports, that’s live entertainment, and you’re actually competing against one another is big time. No, reality TV is not like that.

Also, unfair partisan advantage isn’t the only harm of gerrymanders.\n\nThe Texas Remap\n\nRepublicans currently hold 25 of Texas’s 38 congressional districts. President Trump has argued that Texas’s legislature could and should draw a new map that groups Democratic members into the same districts, and creates a handful of new Republican districts.\n\nThis would require creative gerrymandering — drawing winding, stretched out districts and carving up communities. A partisan gerrymander in the middle of a decade would also be an extraordinary power grab. In most states, the legislature and the governor could theoretically redraw a congressional map at any time, but they almost never do. Typically, a legislature redraws the congressional map after every Census, and that map remains in place for a decade.\n\nSometimes judges redraw maps or force the legislature to redraw a map because of supposed civil rights violations. In Texas ahead of the 2002 elections, the legislature deadlocked and so a state judge drew the map. When Republicans took control of the state government, the legislature then drew a new map. \n\nIn the past 150 years, there have basically been no cases where a legislature redrew the map mid-decade for simple partisan gain.\n\nIf Texas breaks precedent this summer, Democrats and the legacy media warn it will set off an arms race. California Gov. Gavin Newsom suggested he would retaliate against a Texas mid-decade gerrymander with one of his own. (One problem with this threat is that California is already much more gerrymandered than Texas, and there’s less juice left to squeeze.)\n\nStates might redistrict whenever a new party takes over the legislature or governorship. They might redistrict whenever an incumbent dies or retires. They could redistrict whenever the political winds change. This could create chaos, more gerrymandering, and more partisan rancor.\n\nSo Democrats have fair criticism of Trump’s plans for Texas. But when they claim innocence on the gerrymandering front, they lose all credibility.\n\nGerrymandering is not a GOP thing\n\nDemocrats have their share of absurd gerrymanders today. California and Illinois are prime examples. You can look at the shapes of the districts to see the gerrymander, and you can also compare the popular vote to the partisan balance of the congressional delegation.\n\nIn California, for instance, Democrats hold 43 of the 52 seats, which is 83%. In the November election, though, they won just 60% of the vote. Likewise, in Illinois, Democrats have a 14-to-3 majority in the congressional delegation (82%) after winning 53% of the popular vote.\n\nRepublicans’ gerrymanders just about counteract the Democratic gerrymanders, the 2024 numbers suggest: If you discard the votes for third parties, Republican congressional candidates won 51.4% of the vote on Election Day, and that translated into 50.1% of the House seats. If we used this measure, Republicans “should have” won 224 seats instead of 220.\n\nBut the above math is too simplistic. The skewed ratios in various states do not prove a gerrymander. There are many reasons why one party might win a far higher percentage of seats than its popular vote would suggest.\n\nFor instance, imagine a state with ten congressional seats where the Democrats make up two-thirds of the population. Now imagine that the Republicans are evenly distributed throughout the state. Every voting precinct would have about 67% Democrats, and so each of the nine congressional districts, however you drew the map, would be about 69% Democratic. The result would likely be a 9-0 Democratic delegation in a 2-to-1 Democratic state.\n\nMassachusetts is pretty close to this: Democrats get about 60 to 65% of the vote and hold all nine seats.\n\nMore commonly, there are some states where Democrats are more consolidated into a few overwhelmingly urban pockets, while Republicans make up smaller majorities in the rest of the state. Wisconsin is a prime example of this.\n\nDemocrats and the news media complain endlessly about the Republicans’ 6-2 majority in Wisconsin’s congressional delegation while the GOP wins only about 51% of the votes.\n\nBut if you look at Wisconsin’s map, the districts are all fairly compact and sensible. The Democrats win the district centered Madison and the one centered on Milwaukee, and that’s where Democratic voters are clustered. More than 35% of Kamala Harris voters in Wisconsin, for instance, live in Milwaukee or Dane County, and this leaves the other 70 counties as majority Republican.\n\nThe result is Democrats winning two seats with about 70% of the vote in each of the districts, while Republicans carry six seats with 60% or less in each district, including two close races.\n\nWho started it?\n\nWhen the Texas mid-decade remap comes up, Democrats often warn — laughably — that it could cause them to start gerrymandering.\n\nIndeed, if one mentions a Democratic gerrymander, such as Maryland, Illinois, or California, commentators will rush to cast them as Democratic responses to GOP gerrymanders.\n\nAmong online millennials, there is a belief that gerrymandering started last decade by the Tea Parties.\n\nIt is true that Republicans got a lasting advantage because their biggest wave year was at the turn of the decade, which gave them control of many legislatures just in time to draw new maps.\n\nBut partisan gerrymandering didn’t start with 2011 Republicans. It’s been a constant, bipartisan practice.\n\nCalifornia Democrats, for instance, controlled more than 60% of the congressional delegation after the 2002 elections in which they won only 51% of the vote.\n\nIn Georgia, Democrats controlled the state legislature in 2001 and drew a blatant gerrymander intended to give them a majority in the Congressional delegation. Many districts included thin strands to connect distant parts of the state, hoping to pack the Republicans into 6 of the 13 districts. This proved an overreach, and Republicans in 2002 ended up winning two of the districts drawn for Democrats.\n\nMaryland Democrats in 2002 won 6 of 8 (75%) U.S. House districts with 54% of the vote after redrawing the maps to break up counties and neighborhoods.\n\nThen the next decade, Maryland Democrats drew an even more extreme gerrymander that boosted their advantage to 7-1. The details of Democrats’ Maryland gerrymanders reveal one of the ways that gerrymandering harms democracy.\n\nNo representation and no competition\n\nIn 2021, Maryland’s Republican Gov. Larry Hogan rolled out a massive campaign to help deliver the COVID-19 vaccine to the people of his state. In the first few weeks, while demand still outstripped supply, the state prioritized vaccinating the older residents. As a result, the more rural counties got more vaccines than the suburban counties.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) used his perch as a congressman to complain about this. He argued that Montgomery County residents deserved priority over the residents of other counties — that his county should have a higher percentage of its population vaccinated than the counties with older populations.\n\nThat’s a pretty odd argument on its face, but his defenders said he was simply advocating for his constituents — and that’s the rub. Raskin never mentioned the more rural Carroll and Frederick Counties, which were also in his district.\n\nWhy did a Congressman from Takoma Park, which touches D.C., also represent rural towns on the Pennsylvania border? Because Democrats drew three districts that reached from the inner suburbs out to the rural parts in northern and western parts of the state so that there wouldn’t be a Western Maryland district (because that could be won by a Republican).\n\nThe current Maryland map, created after the 2020 Census, likewise denies Western Maryland its own district, roping it in with Montgomery County instead of with more similar Carroll County. As a result, Western Maryland has a Democratic Congresswoman from Potomac, a wealthy suburb of D.C.\n\nThat is, gerrymandering doesn’t merely give the party in charge an unfair advantage, it effectively leaves a portion of the state without representation.\n\nMuch gerrymandering is not aimed at maximizing partisan advantage but at protecting incumbents. This is just another instance of an iron rule of politics: People in power use their power to remain in power.\n\nOne result: 95% of U.S. House seats are not competitive in the general election. If members are not afraid of losing in the general election, they are not responsive to the public. If the only time they could lose is in the primary election, they have more incentive to embrace extremism and suck up to party leaders.\n\nThere’s not likely any good solution to the problem of partisan gerrymandering. There really are harms. It’s just another example of the breakdown of norms in U.S. politics.","summary":"If you read about congressional gerrymanders these days, you might come away with the impression that it’s a Republican thing.

Cory Mills (R-FL) told the Washington Examiner. “No one has been a bigger supporter of President Trump’s policies, and she would be a great addition to the administration.”\n\nMills acknowledged that “many fear Laura’s talents and determination,” but said that her vetting and perseverance have “never deterred her from her love of country.”\n\nScott Jennings, a conservative commentator and rumored GOP Senate candidate, made a similar point about the typical vetting process in Washington.\n\n“I actually don’t think it is all that unusual for a president to have people working for him, inside or outside the building, with information and opinions about appointments,” Jennings said. “I certainly did a lot of research on potential appointees when I worked for Bush 43 [President George W. Bush]. What the president chooses to do with that information is up to him.”\n\nYet Loomer herself is happy to play up her influence as vetter-in-chief.\n\n“If I worked in the White House, I’d be shackled by the same rules and red tape that protect the very people I expose,” Loomer posted on X Friday. “I wouldn’t be able to shine a light on the rot inside the Federal Government or catch people like Maurene Comey hiding in plain sight.”\n\nComey, the daughter of former FBI director James Comey, is a Manhattan federal prosecutor fired by the Trump administration two weeks ago. Comey was notably involved in criminal cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n“In D.C., everyone’s knifing each other to climb the ladder,” Loomer added. “They tried to knife President Trump, and they have tried very hard to knife me too. But, when people in DC get cut, they talk and they come talk to me.”\n\nLoomer did not respond to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner.\n\nShe is certainly no stranger to controversy. Loomer once called the late-Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a “ghetto b****,” has said the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were an “inside job,” and claimed that if then-Vice President Kamala Harris won the 2024 election, the White House would “smell like curry.”\n\nThe full extent of her sway within the White House is debated, and it is unclear how close she is with Trump, according to a Republican strategist who spoke to the Washington Examiner.\n\n“Laura Loomer has or is perceived to have Trump’s ear,” the strategist said. “The extent of her influence or her ability to actually get beyond [White House chief of staff] Susie Wiles is unknown. I don’t see a long line of people rushing to fill out the remaining posts that have yet to be appointed or hired for. Many people just don’t want to be subjected to her attacks.”\n\nComeback Kamala? Harris holds on to her presidential dreams\n\nLoomer has also sparred with elected Republicans such as Rep. Carlos Gimenez (R-FL), who said she “doesn’t have the faintest idea what she’s talking about” after Loomer claimed he was “pissed” about losing a bid to become the Chair of the House Homeland Security Committee.\n\nAs an elected official, Gimenez doesn’t have to worry about losing his job directly because of Loomer. But others have not been so lucky. Earlier this week, for example, Food and Drug Administration vaccine official Dr. Vinay Prasad left his position after Loomer branded him a “progressive, left-wing” figure.\n\nThe White House insists that top staffing, whether vetted by Loomer or not, remains a top priority so that Trump can enact his agenda as the elected president.\n\n“It is not only appropriate, but critical for the administration to continue to recruit the most qualified and experienced staffers who are totally aligned with President Trump’s agenda to Make America Great Again,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. “The results that this administration has already delivered for the American people — from peace deals to trade deals — prove that President Trump has assembled the best and brightest talent to put Americans and America First.”","summary":"Laura Loomer, who dubs herself an “investigative journalist,” is in the news again amid reports that she is vetting Trump administration officials and even getting some fired for insufficient loyalty to his agenda.

Trump has bristled over a Wall Street Journal report that he allegedly sent a suggestive letter to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003. Trump denied sending the message, calling it a \"fake,\" and last month he filed a $10-billion defamation suit against Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co., Murdoch and others. The billionaire — who sits at the top of the world's most prominent conservative media empire — has become the focus of the president's fury. \"I hope Rupert and his 'friends' are looking forward to the many hours of depositions and testimonies they will have to provide in this case,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, a nod to \"Fox & Friends,\" one of his favorite TV programs. The Journal, he wrote, is a “Disgusting and Filthy Rag,\" and Murdoch's \"'pile of garbage' newspaper.\" Trump's attorneys applied more heat last week in a startling bid to force Murdoch to promptly appear for a deposition. In a motion, Trump's lawyers cited the mogul's age and health complications, which they said includes a recent fainting episode, and over the last five years, a broken back, a torn Achilles tendon and atrial fibrillation, which could make Murdoch \"unavailable for in-person testimony at trial.\" Through a spokesman, Murdoch declined to comment. The tussle provides a rare glimpse into the tangled relationship of two titans whose dealings date back a half-century when the Australian-born Murdoch arrived in the U.S. and bought the New York Post, a punchy tabloid with screaming headlines. Trump forged his reputation as a New York real estate tycoon, in part, by dishing scoops to the paper's celebrity-hungry Page Six. And Fox News would become one of Trump's biggest champions. The network has long heaped on positive attention that helped Trump transform himself from reality TV star to the political hero of his Make America Great Again base. The cable network gave Trump a platform for his unfounded \"birther\" conspiracies about former President Obama. And Trump's political rise helped build Fox News into a ratings and financial juggernaut. This summer, Fox News ranks as America's No. 1 network, according to measurement firm Nielsen, attracting more viewers in prime time than broadcast leaders NBC and CBS. What's more, a string of Fox News personalities have joined Trump's administration, including former weekend host, now secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth. Murdoch and Trump \"feed off one another — they've had this relationship since the ’70s where they kind of benefit from one another,\" said Andrew Dodd, a journalism professor at the University of Melbourne. \"But they also have these turns where they're against each other.\" Gabriel Kahn, a USC journalism professor and former Wall Street Journal reporter, said the tension is real. \"As much as Rupert has pumped up Trump World over the last 10 years, Rupert really sees himself as the kingmaker — not the lackey,\" Kahn said. Trump's social media posts over the years reveal bouts of frustration with Murdoch and his media properties. The two men have different political philosophies: Murdoch is known to be a small-government Reagan Republican, \"not a true conservative populist\" in the MAGA vein, according to one Republican political operative who was not authorized to speak publicly. Insiders and observers point to a series of slights, including a 2015 remark Murdoch made on Twitter a month after Trump descended on the golden escalator at Trump Tower to announce his first presidential bid, and then ignited a firestorm with anti-immigrant comments. \"When is Donald Trump going to stop embarrassing his friends, let alone the whole country?\" Murdoch asked a decade ago. Murdoch, at turns, tried to recruit or boost rival presidential hopefuls. Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis received flattering coverage on Fox News early in President Biden's term. By that time, Trump was back at Mar-a-Lago after losing the 2020 election and Fox News was navigating treacherous terrain. The network was the first major outlet to call Arizona for Biden on election night, riling Trump and his supporters who viewed the move as a betrayal, one that short-circuited their claims the election had been stolen. Fox News witnessed an immediate viewer exodus. To win back Trump supporters, the network gave a platform to Trump surrogates who suggested machines flipped votes for Biden, despite the fact that Murdoch and others knew such claims were false, court filings revealed. Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic sued for defamation. Discovery in the Dominion lawsuit revealed that, two days after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, Murdoch wanted to carve some distance, writing a former executive: \"We want to make Trump a non person.\" In a 2023 deposition, Murdoch conceded missteps of spreading the unfounded theories. Fox that spring agreed to pay Dominion $787.5 million — one of the largest payouts ever for a U.S. libel suit. The Smartmatic case is still pending. \"They promulgated the 'Big Lie,'\" Dodd said of Fox News' post-2020 election coverage. \"Now, in the twilight years of his life, Murdoch [may be] thinking: 'Well, this man really is not worth supporting any longer.'\" Such a shift would not be out of character. Murdoch, in the past, has promoted political leaders and governments, only to pull that support. In the 1970s, after initially backing Australia's then-Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, Murdoch allegedly directed his editors to \"Kill Whitlam,\" in a political (not violent) sense. Twenty years later in Britain, Murdoch abandoned the Conservatives after being a close ally of former leader Margaret Thatcher. He famously threw the weight of his tabloid, the Sun, behind Labor's Tony Blair. After years of backing Tories, the Sun shifted back to Labor and Keir Starmer last year, saying that \"it is time for a change.\" \"Murdoch has a long career of breaking what he makes,\" Dodd said. His vast empire, divvied between News Corp. and Fox Corp., allows his outlets to have different leanings. The Journal has lent more skeptical coverage to Trump. It broke stories about Trump's hush-money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy bunny Karen McDougal. This year, its editorial board called his high tariffs \"the dumbest trade war in history.\" Fox News, however, remains staunchly in the president's camp. Murdoch is \"putting one part of the organization in attack mode while keeping the other [Fox News] in reserve while it benefits from the base of the person that he's attacking,\" Dodd said. The media baron has long relished his proximity to power. He attended Trump's second inauguration in January and participated with business leaders in an Oval Office meeting a few weeks later. Murdoch was reportedly among Trump's circle of VIPs in New Jersey on July 13 for the FIFA Club World Cup soccer championship match. Two days later, a Journal reporter emailed White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, advising that the paper was preparing to publish a story about the Epstein birthday letter, according to Trump's lawsuit. Trump's lawyers pushed back, saying the allegations were false. Trump called Murdoch, according to court filings. \"Murdoch advised President Trump that 'he would take care of it,'\" Trump wrote in a July 17 post on Truth Social, the day the story published. \"Obviously, he didn't have the power to do so,\" Trump wrote. Trump sued the next day. A Dow Jones spokeswoman responded: \"We have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.\" The legal dustup comes after a string of controversial wins for the president. Last month, Paramount Global agreed to pay Trump $16 million to settle a dispute over \"60 Minutes\" edits of a Kamala Harris interview, a lawsuit that 1st Amendment experts said had no merit. In December, Walt Disney Co. paid $16 million to end a defamation lawsuit brought by Trump over inaccurate statements by ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos — an outcome derided by some 1st Amendment experts who thought Disney would eventually prevail. \"President Trump has already beaten George Stephanopoulos/ABC, 60 Minutes/CBS, and others, and looks forward to suing and holding accountable the once great Wall Street Journal,\" Trump wrote. \"It has truly turned out to be a 'Disgusting and Filthy Rag.'” Murdoch watchers don't expect him to capitulate. \"In this bizarre world that we live in, Rupert is actually one of the few people who might be willing to stand up to Trump,\" Kahn said. \"Remember, Rupert loves newspapers, he loves the scoop and he loves to stir the pot.\" Times staff writer Stephen Battaglio contributed to this report.","summary":"Trump sued Rupert Murdoch and his News Corp. for $10 billion over the Wall Street Journal's report that Trump allegedly sent a sexually suggestive letter to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday decades ago.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-08-03/rupert-murdoch-trump-epstein-wsj","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3918449/2147483647/strip/false/crop/7843x5229+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F09%2F41c8060c463394a8f665872f6ace%2Fgettyimages-220442927","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 10:00:00","author":"Meg James","authors":["Meg James"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.077},{"id":347740682,"title":"Barabak: In America's hardest-fought congressional district, voters agree: Release the Epstein files","text":"When it comes to President Trump, Angie Zamora and Phaidra Medeiros agree on very little. Zamora, a 36-year-old Army veteran, has nothing good to say. \"The laws. All the rights taken away from women. The stuff with ICE,\" Zamora said, ticking off her frustrations as she stopped outside the post office in the Central Valley community of Los Banos. \"Why are they going after people working on farms when they're supposed to be chasing violent criminals?\" Medeiros, by contrast, is delighted Trump replaced Joe Biden. \"He wasn't mentally fit,\" Medeiros said of the elderly ex-president. \"There was something wrong with him from the very beginning.\" Despite all that, the two do share one belief: Both say the government should cough up every last bit of information it has on Jeffrey Epstein, his sordid misdeeds and the powerful associates who moved in his aberrant orbit. Trump \"did his whole campaign on releasing the Epstein files,\" Zamora said. \"And now he's trying to change the subject. 'Oh, it's a 'hoax' ... 'Oh, you guys are still talking about that creep?' And yet there's pictures throughout the years of him with that creep.\" Medeiros, 56, echoed the sentiment. Trump and his fellow Republicans \"put themselves into this predicament because they kept talking constantly\" about the urgency of unsealing records in Epstein's sex-trafficking case — until they took control of the Justice Department and the rest of Washington. \"Now,\" she said, \"they’re backpedaling.\" Medeiros paused outside the engineering firm where she works in the Central Valley, in Newman, on a tree-lined street adorned with star-spangled banners honoring local servicemen and women. \"Obviously there were minors involved\" in Epstein's crimes, she said, and if Trump is somehow implicated \"then he needs to go down as well.\" Years after being found dead in a Manhattan prison cell — killed by his own hand, according to authorities — Epstein appears to have done the near-impossible in this deeply riven nation. He's united Democrats, Republicans and independents around a call to reveal, once and for all, everything that's known about his case. \"He's dead now, but if people were involved they should be prosecuted,\" said Joe Toscano, a 69-year-old Los Banos retiree and unaffiliated voter who last year supported Trump's return to the White House. \"Bring it all out there. Make it public.\" California's 13th Congressional District, where Zamora, Medeiros and Toscano all live, is arguably the most closely fought political terrain in America. Sprawling through California's midriff, from the far reaches of the San Francisco Bay Area to the southern edge of the San Joaquin Valley, it's farm country: Flat, fertile and crossed-hatched with canals, rail lines and thruways with utilitarian names such as Road No. 32 and Avenue 18½. The myriad small towns are brief interludes amid the dairy and poultry farms and lush carpeting of vegetables, fruit and nut trees that stretch to the hazy-brown horizon. The most populous city, Merced, has fewer than 100,000 residents. (Modesto, with a population of around 220,000, is split between the 5th and 13th districts.) Democratic Rep. Adam Gray was elected in November in the closest House race in the country, beating the Republican incumbent, John Duarte, by 187 votes out of nearly 211,000 cast. The squeaker was a rematch and nearly a rerun. Two years prior, Duarte defeated Gray by fewer than 600 votes out of nearly 134,000 cast. Not surprisingly, both parties have made the 13th District a top target in 2026; handicappers rate the contest a toss-up, even as the field sorts itself out. (Duarte has said he would not run again.) The midterm election is a long way off, so it's impossible to say how the Epstein controversy will play out politically. But there is, at the least, a baseline expectation of transparency, a view that was repeatedly expressed in conversations with three dozen voters across the district. Zachery Ramos, a 25-year-old independent, is the founder of the Gustine Traveling Library, which promotes learning and literacy throughout the Central Valley. Its storefront, painted with polka dots and decorated with giant butterflies, sits like a cheery oasis in Gustine's four-block downtown, a riot of green spilling from the planter boxes out front. Inside, the walls were filled with commendations and newspaper clippings celebrating Ramos' good works. As a nonprofit, he said, \"we have to have everything out there. All the books. Everything.\" Epstein, he suggested, should be treated no differently. \"When it comes to something as serious as that, with what may or may not have taken place on his private island, with his girlfriend\" — convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell — \"I do think it should all be out in the open,\" Ramos said. \"If you're not afraid of your name being in [the files], especially when you're dealing with minors being assaulted, it should 100% be made public.\" Ed, a 42-year-old Democrat who manages a warehouse operation in Patterson, noted that Trump released the government's long-secret files on the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., even though King's family objected. (Like several of those interviewed, he declined to give his last name, to avoid being hassled by readers who don't like what he had to say.) Why, Ed wondered, shouldn't the Epstein files come to light? \"It wasn't just Trump,\" he said. \"It was a lot of Republicans in Congress that said, 'Hey, we want to get these files out there.' And I believe if Kamala [Harris] had won, they would be beating her down, demanding she do so.\" He smacked a fist in his palm, to emphasize the point. Sue, a Madera Republican and no fan of Trump, expressed her feelings in staccato bursts of fury. \"Apparently the women years ago said who was doing what, but nobody listens to the women,\" said the 75-year-old retiree. \"Release it all! Absolutely! You play, you pay, buddy.\" Even those who dismissed the importance of Epstein and his crimes said the government should hold nothing back — if only to erase doubts and lay the issue to rest. Epstein \"is gone and I don't really care if they release the files or not,\" said Diane Nunes, a 74-year-old Republican who keeps the books for her family farm, which lies halfway between Los Banos and Gustine. \"But they probably should, because a lot of people are waiting for that.\" Patrick, a construction contractor, was more worked up about \"pretty boy\" Gavin Newsom and \"Nazi Pelosi\" — \"yes, that's what I call her\" — than anything that might be lurking in the Epstein files. \"When the cat is dead, you don't pick it up and pet it.

Henry Cuellar’s 28th District in South Texas — the GOP map-drawers crafted new boundaries that make each seat more favorable for Republicans while also adding more Hispanic voters to the district.\n\nThese three districts would be majority Hispanic, as would the seat held by Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-McAllen, whose South Texas seat Republicans are also gunning for.\n\nIf the districts were in place during the 2024 election, Trump would have carried each by at least 10 percentage points, according to a Texas Tribune analysis.\n\nSuch margins depended, in large part, on Hispanic-majority counties whose voters have been moving rightward since 2016. And in 2024, when the vast majority of U.S. counties shifted right, predominantly Hispanic counties saw even more pronounced movement.\n\nTrump carried all four counties in the Rio Grande Valley after failing to crack 30% in the region during his first presidential bid, and he won 14 of the 18 Texas counties within 20 miles of the border.\n\nBut Trump’s coattails extended only so far down the ballot, with Democrats winning numerous local races in the same counties that recorded eye-popping shifts at the top of the ticket. Cuellar and Gonzalez secured reelection even as Trump carried their districts, and even with Cuellar also facing down an indictment for alleged money laundering and bribery.\n\nGOP Sen. Ted Cruz, appearing just below Trump on November ballots, ran well behind his party’s nominee in a number of South Texas locales, especially those with larger Latino populations. If the new lines proposed for Cuellar’s district had been in place, the 28th District would have gone for Trump by 10 points, while Cruz would have eked out a narrow 0.1% win.\n\nWithout Trump at the top of the ticket in 2026 and three of the five target districts increasing their share of Hispanic voters, the GOP map-drawers are making what could amount to a risky bet that enough Latino voters will turn out again to support GOP candidates across the ballot.\n\nChuck Rocha, a Democratic strategist who has worked in Texas politics for decades and hosts a podcast about Latino voters, believes Trump has a unique appeal to Hispanic voters that doesn’t necessarily trickle down to other Republican candidates.\n\nEspecially potent was Trump’s assertion that the economic system was rigged against Americans and he would be the one to fix it, Rocha said.\n\nThat sort of messaging transcends partisan affiliation, Rocha said, arguing that Trump in 2024 and progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2020 each overperformed in the Rio Grande Valley and with Latino voters “because their messages aligned around a rigged system, around failed trade policies and reinvigorating economic populism.”\n\n“The newest swingy electorate in Texas”\n\nTrump’s freewheeling lack of political correctness also led some Hispanic voters to associate him with “machismo,” Gilberto Hinojosa, the former Texas Democratic Party chair and Cameron County judge, said. “In some parts of our community, they could relate to that.”\n\nCampaign operatives from both parties pinpointed two issues that drove Latino voters to the right last November: immigration and the economy.\n\nDuring the campaign, those operatives told the Tribune, President Joe Biden and Democrats struggled to convince voters they were doing enough to secure the southern border, while inflation hit the electorate’s pocketbooks and proved an especially damaging issue for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris among Hispanic voters.\n\n“Four years of open borders and 12 million illegal immigrants coming into this country did real damage across Texas, but in the Hispanic community in particular,” Cruz told The Texas Tribune last week. “I think that was a big part of the reason why both President Trump and I won Hispanics statewide, and why the two of us flipped the Rio Grande Valley.”\n\nBut Rocha doesn’t think this means Trump and other Republicans are sure to hold onto those gains with Latino voters, who he labeled “the newest swingy electorate in Texas.”\n\nTrump’s approval rating is underwater among Hispanic voters. A July national poll by Equis Research found that one-third of Hispanic voters who backed Biden in 2020 then Trump in 2024 are planning to vote for a Democratic congressional candidate. Another one-third of these voters are undecided.\n\nDemocrats are gearing up to court Latino voters in next year’s midterms by homing in on the economy, already deploying messaging that highlights Trump’s tariff strategy — which many economists have said will worsen inflation — to paint Republicans as unconcerned with the day-to-day lives of Americans.\n\n“Throughout this cycle Democrats will be laser focused on making sure Latino voters know the harm that has come from the Republican trifecta and highlighting how Republicans broke their promise to lower costs and instead gave billionaires a tax cut at their communities’ expense,” said Madison Andrus, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House Democrats’ campaign arm.\n\nRepublicans largely believe they can outflank Democrats by simply reminding voters of the record-high inflation under Biden’s presidency.\n\nPrices for some common goods have fallen since Trump returned to the White House, a fact that GOP operative Wayne Hamilton sees as a bulwark against a Democratic resurgence among Latinos. “Long term, that's good for South Texas,” said Hamilton, who leads a group, Project Red TX, that focuses on recruiting and supporting Republican candidates in South Texas. “That’s good for the border. That’s good for America.”\n\nJobs are also likely to be central to any messaging to Latino voters.\n\nIn South Texas, many Hispanic voters work in the fracking industry — a sector some Democrats want to phase out in favor of clean energy alternatives. That plan, Hinojosa said, is viewed by Latinos as an existential threat to their jobs and way of life, despite the employment opportunities also generated by renewable energy.\n\n“What’s important to Hispanics in South Texas is quality jobs that provide good wages and working conditions and benefits,” Hinojosa said. Rocha agreed, arguing that Democrats should run ads centered on the “sanctity of work.”\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Republicans are looking to do the same. To win Hispanic voters, Cruz said Republicans need to “remain the party of jobs,” calling it his “No. 1 priority in the Senate.”\n\nThe National Republican Campaign Committee is also recruiting Latino candidates to run in districts that could tilt in their favor if new Texas maps are approved. Gonzalez has drawn a challenge from Eric Flores, a Republican Army veteran and lawyer from Mission, while Cuellar may face Democrat-turned-Republican Webb County Judge Tano Tijerina, who is mulling a race.\n\n“Hispanic communities in South Texas are sick and tired of out of touch Democrats Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez turning their backs on them time and again,” NRCC spokesperson Zach Bannon said in a statement.\n\nMayra Flores, a Republican who briefly represented the 34th District after winning a 2022 special election for part of 2022, has already announced a bid against Cuellar.\n\nThe lineup for The Texas Tribune Festival continues to grow!

He was!\n\nThat question seems to be dismissed too easily by the jet-setting public employees in the Bay State. (Yes, we’re talking about you, Attorney General Andrea Campbell.) But we are not afraid to admit the Southern Border was a sieve under President Joe Biden and his Border Czar, VP Kamala Harris.\n\nMassGOP Chair Amy Carnevale did credit the Trump administration for helping out here.\n\nShe said: “The end of Massachusetts’ emergency shelter crisis is the result of strong border policies, enacted by the Trump administration, which stemmed the tide of unchecked immigration that took place in the Biden administration.\n\n“A crisis continues, however, in the Commonwealth’s HomeBASE program, where illegal immigrants ineligible for legal employment are receiving taxpayer subsidies to pay their rent,” she added. “Governor Healey should work with federal authorities to return these individuals to their home countries, opening up apartments for citizens in Massachusetts’ strained housing market.”\n\nThe illegal immigration issue does not make for good photo ops for Democrats. The sight of families trudging through the Darién Gap, where “migrants risk death,” is a humanitarian nightmare that was fueled by Biden’s open border policies. America has a legal immigration system that, however flawed, allows newcomers into our country.\n\nCircumventing that system produced this disaster.\n\nHarris lost the election for many reasons, but illegal immigration was one of them.

Especially when considering the fact that the first she was able to campaign for president the way she wanted, she was forced to drop out before Iowa.\n\nThe panel led viewers to believe she was stifled, misread, mishandled, and misunderstood, but pure of heart. And now, with the dust of the election season settled, she can finally speak her side of the story, free from any Biden loyalists going after her throat.\n\n That would be a compelling story, if people hadn’t already seen the truth play out in the latter half of the 2024 election cycle. Kamala Harris had a big presidential campaign launch, a national profile, and donor enthusiasm. She had celebrity endorsements, an SNL appearance, and “brat”. All campaign bases were thought to have been covered. But within a few hours into election night, it was clear that the American people didn’t want a spokesperson, marketed President.\n\nThe desperation to recast her as suddenly genuine, warm, and real, ignores the fact that voters aren’t asking for a reboot when they’ve already seen and hated the pilot.\n\nThere’s a difference between a politician who hasn’t had the spotlight and one who’s had it and couldn’t hold the room. Harris belongs in the second category. Every cycle brings candidates who fade. The problem is disconnect with voters, and no amount of airtime could manufacture that.\n\nCNN can keep pretending this moment was some grand unveiling, and telling us we just have to get to know the real Kamala. But viewers remember the last time Kamala Harris was front and center. They remember the cackle laughter, the pivots, the absence of clarity. They didn’t respond then, and there’s no indication they’ve changed their minds now. The network can keep painting a different picture, but the canvas isn’t blank. It never was.\n\nAt the end of the day, CNN could keep pitching this “real Kamala” like a sequel nobody asked for. But just like that awful blind date, you can’t forget the strangeness from her campaign. No matter how many times you hear, “she’s got a great personality.”\n\nThe entire transcript is below.

The head of the Department of Labor is Lori Chavez-DeRemer, appointed by Trump.Last Friday, the BLS reported that there was only an addition of 73,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in July, below market expectations. Additionally, the BLS revised sharply downward job gains from two months earlier, slashing a total of 258,000 from previous data. Over three months, job growth rate was only 35,000. This is the largest two-month downward revision since April 2020, the onset of the Covid crisis.Trump and Republican congress members have repeatedly criticized the BLS for years over the data it collects. Trump noted that last year, the BLS also announced a major revision that reduced the increase in wages for the 12 months before March 2024 by 818,000.Trump had previously criticized the BLS over job data and revisions published. Speaking to reporters on Friday night, he said he had always had problems with these figures.In 2016, during his first presidential campaign, Trump claimed that the unemployment rate was much higher than that revealed by the BLS. In 2024, he accused the administration of former President Joe Biden of orchestrating efforts to cover up, after the BLS reported that they had counted more than 818,000 jobs in the previous 12 months.Editor's Choice: Four US Democratic Lawmakers Urge Trump to End War in GazaClick here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News","summary":"Trump fires the Director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for low employment figures that do not meet expectations.","url":"https://en.tempo.co/read/2035519/trump-fires-us-bureau-of-labor-statistics-director-over-disappointing-job-figures","image":"https://statik.tempo.co/data/2025/07/25/id_1415813/1415813_720.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 06:08:11","author":"Dewi Rina Cahyani","authors":["Dewi Rina Cahyani"],"language":"en","source_country":"id","sentiment":-0.329},{"id":347683130,"title":"US game in the region","text":"THERE is considerable euphoria in Pakistan over what is viewed as a marked improvement in its relations with the US administration under President Donald Trump and the trough that Washington-New Delhi ties seem to have hit.\n\nBut is this euphoria well-founded and will it last? Some observers are already calling the shift in US-Pakistan relations a realignment and change in direction. If this ‘realignment’ means a shift away from Beijing for Islamabad, then I suspect these analysts may not have it right. This is simply because Beijing represents the sort of reliable partner and friend that Islamabad has been increasingly dependent on for many of its economic needs and infrastructure development. Pakistan also remains an integral part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nMore significantly, with an increasingly belligerent Hindu nationalist government in charge in New Delhi, which is constantly kicking up anti-Pakistan sentiment to cement its communal support base, Islamabad needs military hardware to deter Indian ambitions — in addition to the nuclear deterrent, of course.\n\nHaving said that, there are opportunities for Pakistan that are not part of a zero-sum game. Unlike the US, China’s relationship with not just Pakistan but other nations too isn’t based on ‘you are either with us or against us’. It is far more nuanced and pragmatic, because China for now is focused on economic development and trade.\n\nIt would be naïve to assume that ties between global powers hinge on relatively minor issues.\n\nWestern democracies often point fingers at China’s lack of political freedoms and human rights. But rarely do they laud how China has pulled 800 million people out of poverty in just 40 years. And in the current state of play, particularly in Gaza where almost the entire ‘democratic’ West is complicit in the ethnic cleansing there, while suppressing domestic dissent over this policy, they hardly have a leg to stand on when they pontificate about freedoms. The Gaza Palestinians are being denied the most basic freedom: the right to life.\n\nFor now, two things have gone in Pakistan’s favour. Firstly, Islamabad attached the right kind of importance to Trump’s narcissism. It nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize, and gave his ‘tough leader’ image a boost by quickly apprehending and extraditing one of the accused in the Kabul Airport ‘Abbey Gate’ bombing. The attack, which occurred in August 2021 during the US withdrawal, left 13 US service personnel and nearly 200 Afghans dead.\n\nThen, when India attacked Pakistani targets in May last year after a terror attack in Indian-held Kashmir, and the US asked both sides for de-escalation, US sources say, Islamabad was quick to respond positively and gave the narcissistic leader a ‘win’. Trump does not tire of claiming the mantle of peacemaker for himself. This massaged his ego no end.\n\nOn the other hand, those in the know say that India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made two moves that upset Trump. The first was reportedly cancelling a meeting with Trump during his US visit last year when the then presidential candidate was on the campaign trail.\n\nThe Indians firmly deny that any meeting was scheduled but during a campaign address on Sept 17 Trump said he’d be meeting Modi. Diplomatic sources said that the Modi meetings were pencilled in with both presidential candidates — Trump and Kamala Harris. The latter had to cancel her meeting due to a last-minute development and, therefore, Modi was advised by his team to also cancel the Trump meeting so he did not appear to be meeting/ endorsing one candidate. If true, this must have bruised Trump’s enormous ego.\n\nAnother irritant is said to have surfaced during India’s aggression against Pakistan in May this year. American leaders were working the phones to put a lid on the conflict before it spiralled out of control and both South Asian nations told the White House that they’d de-escalate. But India went ahead and launched missile attacks in retaliation for losing an embarrassing number of warplanes in combat, which led to the grounding of prime IAF assets for two days. Pakistan also retaliated and in the small hours of May 10, a top Pakistan official is said to have informed the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio that India’s firing of dual-use missiles was a dangerous escalation and Pakistan was exercising restraint only at America’s request.\n\nThis reportedly also caused ties to sour as Trump may have felt India chose to slight America by saying one thing and doing the opposite. Although India responded to the renewed US effort and Trump was able to announce a ceasefire some heartburn had been triggered.\n\nThe chain of events may have contributed to the deterioration of ties between the US and India but it would be naïve to assume that relations between global powers hinge only on such relatively small issues, even if some of the leaders have bloated egos.\n\nThe major irritant in US-India ties is the latter country’s membership of BRICS where Russia and China have joined hands with Brazil, India, South Africa and a host of smaller countries to create a trading bloc. The grouping is pursuing the idea of a new currency for trade without the US dollar. Were this to happen, the dollar would lose its pre-eminence and the world would find a way around US sanctions through a new payment system. The US finds this intolerable, even if many see it as inevitable.\n\nAmerica has been propping up India as a counter to China, and New Delhi is now also part of the Quad comprising US, Australia and Japan. That is why India’s BRICS membership is seen as incompatible with the West’s strategic architecture in Asia. India may have followed a foreign policy keeping its own interest foremost. It is now being pressured to choose sides.\n\nSo, some social media mocking of India by Trump, including doomsday predictions about its economy and the new tariffs, has more to do with whipping India into line.

Some observers are already calling the shift in US-Pakistan relations a realignment and change in direction. If this ‘realignment’ means a shift away from Beijing for Islamabad, then I suspect these analysts may not have it right. This is simply because Beijing represents the sort of reliable partner and friend that Islamabad has been increasingly dependent on for many of its economic needs and infrastructure development. Pakistan also remains an integral part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative.\n\n\nMore significantly, with an increasingly belligerent Hindu nationalist government in charge in New Delhi, which is constantly kicking up anti-Pakistan sentiment to cement its communal support base, Islamabad needs military hardware to deter I","url":"https://www.dawn.com/news/1928420/us-game-in-the-region","image":"https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/688ec993888fe.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 04:19:41","author":"Abbas Nasir","authors":["Abbas Nasir"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"pk","sentiment":-0.129},{"id":347726672,"title":"Charlamagne tha God shares whether he'd vote for another Kamala Harris ticket","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nOn Air August 02, 2025 07:26 \n\n Charlamagne tha God shares whether he'd vote for another Kamala Harris ticket \n 'The Breakfast Club' host Charlamagne tha God breaks down what he thinks of the first months of President Donald Trump's second term on 'My View with Lara Trump.'\n Tags SHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRMY VIEW WITH LARA TRUMPPERSONALITIESPOLITICS","summary":"&apos;The Breakfast Club&apos; host Charlamagne tha God breaks down what he thinks of the first months of President Donald Trump&apos;s second term on &apos;My View with Lara Trump.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6376501319112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/0d73f092-814a-4302-aab8-8589a7606a7b/cc47e4b9-a585-43de-8398-2fa803bfbc6e/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 01:26:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.721},{"id":347664506,"title":"Stephen A.

No, it doesn’t involve Gavin Newsom or Kamala Harris. Instead, this scrap is between Stephen A. Smith and Michelle Obama.\n\nEarlier this week, the former first lady said she regarded ESPN’s content as little more than reality TV.\n\n“It’s all a sociological study,” Obama said on her podcast. “They think that sports is better reality TV, I’m like, ‘It’s the same thing.’ If I listen to ESPN for an hour, it’s like watching the ‘Real Housewives of Atlanta,’ you know?” Obama said on her brother Craig’s “IMO” podcast. “It’s the same drama, and they’re yelling at each other, and they don’t get along, you know? I mean, Stephen A. Smith, he’s just like every other. . . .\n\n“So, that’s why I’m like, ‘what’s the difference?’ It’s just, you know, it’s just sociological drama,” she said. “I mean, the fact that people over seasons of working still can’t get along. They still have the same arguments, you know, and it’s not just women. But this happens in sports, too. I find it fascinating.”\n\nSmith, never one to take even the slightest criticism lying down, no matter the source. Returned fire during a recent episode of his podcast, taking a shot at not only Obama’s comment, but also her statements while campaigning for Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election.\n\n“When you were campaigning on behalf of the former Vice President Kamala Harris … you said a vote for [President Donald] Trump was a vote against you and a vote against y’all as women. I want to say for the record – I took major offense to that.” Smith asserted.\n\n“I think to this day, it is the only thing that I didn’t like that you said, I didn’t appreciate it. Because there’s so many things that go into deciding where your vote is going to go. For some people, it’s all about the economy. For others, it’s all about national security.\n\n“For some people, it is immigration. For some people, it’s safety in the streets of America. Long before they think about pro-choice or pro-life.”\n\nSmith continued, “But I’m talking specifically to you, Madam First Lady. You are not just beloved, you are revered. You are sensational in so many ways. I’ve been on the record on this show and many others stating had you run for president, you would have beat Trump. I still believe that … I believe if your husband elected to come back, he would beat Trump. That’s my personal belief . . .”\n\nThen Smith specifically addressed Obama’s comments about ESPN.\n\n“So this doesn’t have anything to do with what you were talking about, how sports and reality TV mirror one another, even though we would beg to differ. Because a lot of things on reality TV are made-up situations and scenarios to provoke reactions and all of that stuff.\n\n“We’re at sports, that’s live entertainment, and you’re actually competing against one another is big time. No, reality TV is not like that. You’re so wrong about that, about that assertion, but that’s neither here nor there. . . .\n\n“You will never hear me utter a negative word about you, but I respectfully disagreed and still remain pretty salty about what you said about us.”","summary":"Two potential candidates for the 2028 Democrat nomination are engaged in a war of words.

Bolduan observed that Harris spoke about her choice not to run for the governorship of California and left the door open for another presidential run in 2028.

(AP) — An independent watchdog agency responsible for enforcing a law against partisan political activity by federal employees has opened an investigation into Jack Smith, the Justice Department special counsel who brought two criminal cases against then-candidate Donald Trump before his election to the White House last year.\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel confirmed Saturday that it was investigating Smith on allegations he engaged in political activity through his inquiries into Trump. Smith was named special counsel by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 and his special counsel title is entirely distinct from the agency now investigating him. The office has no criminal enforcement power but does have the authority to impose fines and other sanctions for violations.\n\nIt was not clear what basis exists to contend that Smith’s investigations were political in nature or that he violated the Hatch Act, a federal law that bans certain public officials from engaging in political activity. Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, had earlier this week encouraged the office to scrutinize Smith’s activities and had alleged that his conduct was designed to help then-President Joe Biden and his vice president Kamala Harris, both Democrats.\n\nSmith brought two cases against Trump, one accusing him of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and the other of hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both were brought in 2023, well over a year before the 2024 presidential election, and indictments in the two cases cited what Smith and his team described as clear violations of well-established federal law. Garland has repeatedly said politics played no part in the handling of the cases.\n\nBoth cases were abandoned by Smith after Trump’s November win, with the prosecutor citing longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting the indictment of a sitting president.\n\nThere was no immediate indication that the same office investigating Smith had opened investigations into the Justice Department special counsels who were appointed by Garland to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nThe White House had no immediate comment on the investigation into Smith, which was first reported by The New York Post.\n\nThe office has been riven by leadership tumult over the last year. An earlier chief, Hampton Dellinger, was abruptly fired by the Trump administration and initially sued to get his job back before abandoning the court fight. Trump’s trade representative, Jamieson Greer, is also serving as acting special counsel.\n\nTrump selected as his replacement Paul Ingrassia, a former right-wing podcast host who has praised criminally charged influencer Andrew Tate as a “extraordinary human being” and promoted the false claim that the 2020 election was rigged. A Senate panel was set to consider his nomination at a hearing last month, but it was pulled from the agenda.\n\nTucker reported from Washington.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.
