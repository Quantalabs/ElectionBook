Journalism is under attack, universities are under attack, freedom of speech is under attack and insidious fear is reaching throughout schools, our businesses, our homes and into our private thoughts,” he continued.\n\n“The fear to speak in America. If our government is, in Lincoln’s phrase ‘of the people, by the people, for the people,’ then why are we afraid to speak? Ignorance works for power. Power can change the definition of the words we used to describe reality. This is an old playbook, my friends. There is nothing new in this.”\n\nThe speech, met with scattered applause during the graduation ceremony, was ridiculed on social media by those baffled by Palley’s dramatic gestures and dread-filled rhetoric during the celebratory event.\n\n“Scott Pelley raged at Trump in angry, unhinged commencement address at Wake Forest…as he speaks openly and freely in America,” one user wrote on X. \n\n“This self-important, sermonizing propagandist is what passes for a legacy media ‘journalist’.” \n\nAnother called the liberal-leaning correspondents’ speech a “national disgrace.” \n\nJuanita Broaddrick, who alleged former President Bill Clinton raped her in 1978 when he was Arkansas attorney general, also chimed in, calling Pelley “a pompous POS.”\n\nOthers ripped Pelley as a hypocrite, pointing out that his network is currently facing a $20 billion lawsuit filed by Trump over how “60 Minutes” edited a sit-down with then-Vice President and failed presidential candidate Kamala Harris last fall. \n\nMediation efforts to resolve the suit began earlier this month.\n\n“Did Scott Pelley mention that 60 Minutes edited Kamala’s campaign interview, and they helped her answer questions ???” one user mused on X.\n\n“Unit he does that, his credibility is ZERO.”","summary":"\"This self-important, sermonizing propagandist is what passes for a legacy media 'journalist.'\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/26/media/60-minutes-anchor-scott-pelley-ripped-for-angry-unhinged-commencement-speech-criticizing-trump/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/60-minutes-host-scott-pelley-105372921.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/o5DeVDBU-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-27 00:43:11","author":"Anna Young","authors":["Anna Young"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.163},{"id":325194076,"title":"Brett Favre shares post saying Netflix ‘going after’ him for being ‘an outspoken Trump supporter’","text":"Brett Favre appears to believe Netflix is out to get him due to his support of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe streaming service released its documentary on the Hall of Famer titled “Untold: The Fall of Favre.”\n\nThe documentary highlights the scandals of Favre allegedly sending inappropriate messages to a woman while playing for the New York Jets, and his alleged involvement in the Mississippi State welfare scandal.\n\n“Netflix is going after @BrettFavre for being an outspoken Trump supporter. We stand with Brett Favre,” the Hodge twins wrote.\n\nAnd wrote @SteveLovesAmmo, “Haven’t you ever noticed that these “scandals” seem to pop up (or again) every single time a famous individual vocally supports President Trump?… Brett has been under constant attack from the mainstream media and also now today, Netflix… Tonight, a new documentary premiers tonight on Netflix attempting to tarnish his name. \n\n“We all know that if he wasn’t a Conservative, this would not be happening right now. Was this a hit documentary because Donald Trump won the 2024 election? That has yet to be determined.With that being said, I support .@BrettFavre! One of the greats!”\n\nFavre didn’t comment on whether he agreed or disagreed with the posts but amplified the posts.\n\nWhile speaking at a Trump rally in October just before the election, Favre said it would be “insane” to vote for Kamala Harris.\n\n“We’ve already had President Trump once — we’ve already seen Kamala in action. We can compare, and we know which is better,” Favre said at the rally. “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. . . . It would be insane to give Kamala four more years in office. So it’s time to bench Kamala and put in the star quarterback.”\n\n“USA is a great country. But we all know this: Kamala broke it. Trump will fix it,” Favre added. “I have lived the American dream, but I want to make sure that future generations get to, as well. So remember this: Let’s make American great again.”\n\nFavre has long supported Trump, saying last year that the country was in a “better place” when he was president. He endorsed Trump in 2020 because of his stance on freedom of speech, gun rights and support for the military and police after a summer of racial unrest after the death of George Floyd.\n\nFox News’ Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.","summary":"The streaming service released its documentary on the Hall of Famer titled \"Untold: The Fall of Favre.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/26/sports/brett-favre-shares-post-saying-netflix-going-after-him-for-being-a-trump-supporter/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/105376482.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-27 00:33:59","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":325180028,"title":"Democrats' Support May Be Eroding Among Strongest Backers—Data","text":"There has been more activity by Democrats in Virginia on social media speaking out against the Trump administration than there has been to support the Democratic Party's candidate in this year's gubernatorial race, according to analysis for Newsweek by Impact Social.The data set shows that while former Representative Abigail Spanberger is the frontrunner for the state's top seat, the Democratic Party in the Old Dominion state has spent more time in recent months interacting negatively with President Donald Trump's policies, including the use of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).Spanberger, 45, most recently served as a congresswoman for the state's 7th Congressional District from 2019 to 2025 and is a former intelligence officer.Why It MattersViriginia was once a Republican-leaning state, but suburban shifts and growth in the northern region of the state propelled it leftward over the past two decades. Last November, former Vice President Kamala Harris carried the state by less than 6 points against Trump, down from former President Joe Biden's 10-point win in 2020.However, the prospect of eroding support among reliable Democratic voters in Virginia could have repercussions beyond the state, potentially signaling vulnerability in key battlegrounds for upcoming elections.Virginia serves as a microcosm for broader national trends, with historical analysis showing that demographic and shifts in attitude among voters often precede changes elsewhere in the country.The trend that Impact Social found indicates that Spanberger may lack the key support needed to move her campaign in a winning direction.\"This isn't apathy, it's disengagement. Democrat are showing up online, just not for her,\" Phil Snape of Impact Social said in his analysis.What To KnowThe data shared shows that conversations surrounding Spanberger online dropped from about 9 percent in February and March to 5 percent in April and May discussions.This data is collected from humans, not algorithms, Impact Social pointed out in the analysis.Similar data shows negative sentiment expressed in social media discussions surrounding the former congresswoman remained around -45 and -47.\"Our sentiment insight reveals a serious vulnerability: Spanberger is struggling to energize her own base,\" Snape explained.Other data sets compared to conversations surrounding Spanberger show that her Republican opponent, Virginia's Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, saw a decrease in her net sentiment from +7 in February and March to -3 in April and May.\"But here again, it's Democrats driving the negativity, tying Earle-Sears to Governor [Glenn] Youngkin and the broader GOP VA brand,\" Snape wrote.Comparatively, negative conversations on social media regarding Trump from Democrats, which were about 360,000 and a had a net of -12, according to Impact Social, show the Democratic Party's interest in the upcoming midterms.\"Key issues include corruption, Gaza, tariffs, immigration, democracy and DOGE. The tone is unmistakably combative and energized, the kind of oppositional vigor we tracked across blue leaning constituencies throughout 2024,\" the analysis said.What People Are SayingPhil Snape of Impact Social said in the analysis: \"How Democrats perform and whether they can energize their base will shape national narratives around turnout, enthusiasm and messaging heading into the next cycle. And that's what makes our latest analysis so troubling from a democratic perspective.\"He added: \"There's more at stake here than just Virginia. As one of the highest-profile off-year contests this race will be read as a bellwether for the 2026 midterms. The Democratic base is active, mobilized and clear-eyed about the states. So why aren't they rallying behind their own candidate?\"What the Polls ShowsA poll from Roanoke College last week showed Spanberger had a double-digit lead over Earle-Sears. The poll took data from the 658 Virginians who were surveyed between May 12 to 19, Newsweek previously reported.While 43 percent of respondents planned to vote for Spanberger, only 26 percent indicated they planned to vote for Earle-Sears.The survey also showed that 41 percent of Virginians view Spanberger favorably while 40 percent view her unfavorably. That's compared to a 32 percent viewing Earle-Sears favorably while 48 percent view her unfavorably.The same poll showed that favorability is at an all-time low for GOP Governor Glenn Youngkin, with 50 of respondents viewing him unfavorably.The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 5.25 percentage points.A poll commissioned by business advocacy group Virginia FREE and conducted by Pantheon/HarrisX pointed to a closer race.That poll found Spanberger leading by only four points—52 percent of voters supporting her, and 48 percent backing Earle-Sears. The poll surveyed 1,000 likely voters from May 9 to 13, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.What Happens Next?The results in Virginia will be closely watched for signals about broader national trends as the 2026 midterm cycle progresses.The Virginia gubernatorial election will be held on November 4, 2025. The Cook Political Report currently classifies the race as Lean Democratic, meaning it is \"considered competitive\" but that Democrats do have \"an advantage.\"","summary":"There's been more activity by Democrats in Virginia online speaking out against the Trump administration than support for the Democratic Party's candidate in this year's governor race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/virginia-democrats-support-may-eroding-among-strongest-backers-data-2077212","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2651780/virginia-gubernatorial-candidate-abigail-spanberger-speaks.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-26 23:02:00","author":"Hollie Silverman","authors":["Hollie Silverman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.252},{"id":325180404,"title":"“Biden Lifts Restrictions on Police, Voter Participation Increases, and Other Insights”","text":"Eye on DC: Taking Bidenâs âCuffs off Cops\n\nHarmeet K.

Several exit polls even indicated that Trump gained more of the vote among Latino men. \n\n'Latinos moved 17 points (to the right) in eight years,' Pfeiffer said. 'Latino men went 14 points (toward the GOP) in eight years.'\n\nHe added that 'Latinos are the fastest-growing population' in the country.\n\n'They are particularly politically powerful because of how the population is distributed in electoral-rich sunbelt states like Texas, Florida, Arizona, Nevada,' he said. \n\n'They are becoming more of the electorate, and we are losing more of them at a very fast rate. If that trend continues, there is no path to Democrats winning elections.'\n\nIt comes as voter polls indicate that New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez could be the Democratic Party's next presidential candidate. \n\nThere are 65.2 million Hispanics and Latinos in the US, or around one-fifth of the population, according to the US Census Bureau. \n\n'The message I take from this is, anyone who thinks that we can get away with just tinkering around the edges, just hoping that Donald Trump becomes unpopular or they nominate some yahoo in 2028 or we're going to ride the wave of tariffs and inflation to a narrow House victory is just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic,' Pfieffer added.\n\n'We have to be willing to ask very hard questions.'\n\nEfforts by Trump's campaign group to sway over millions of Hispanic voters proved hugely successful, despite a massive pre-election controversy when a comedian at a Trump rally compared Puerto Rico to a ‘floating island of garbage’. \n\nTrump's biggest gains among Hispanic voters were evident in the key states of Pennsylvania and Michigan.\n\nBefore midnight on election night, Trump became the first Republican since George H.

Kamala Harris’ next move","text":"In one year – almost to the day – Californians will head to the polls in the state’s gubernatorial primary. \n\nAnd despite a crowded field – 17 candidates in all have officially declared – all eyes are on former Vice President Kamala Harris, who has long been rumored to be eying the governor’s mansion, but has avoided entering the race thus far.\n\nTo be sure, if she were to declare her candidacy, Harris would almost certainly make it to the final round of the primary, given her name recognition, which she’s taken steps to strengthen via high-profile speeches and increased visibility.\n\nHowever, waiting this long to either declare or refute her candidacy comes with inherent risks for the former VP.\n\nIndeed, as Harris weighs her options, the race remains frozen, and the greater the risk of her losing some of the appeal she had following her loss to President Trump last November.\n\nPut another way, immediately after that election, Harris’ name recognition and approval ratings were high among Democrats, and many considered her a front runner for either California governor or a 2028 presidential bid.\n\nHowever, in the interim, Harris has done little to address perceptions that she is too far to the left at a time when voters nationally – and in California – have moved to the middle, particularly on social issues.\n\nThat being said, as a former VP who, thrust into an unprecedented campaign, came within a few points in a handful of states from winning the presidency, Harris may believe governor would be a good “rebound” and an easy win.\n\nOf course, there is one fundamental problem Harris faces: it would be virtually impossible to run for governor next year and then run for president in 2028. \n\nEither she’d have to push off – or abandon – her presidential hopes, or open herself up to attacks that she used California as a launching pad for Washington.\n\nTo that end, Harris is approaching the point on the calendar where her silence does more harm than good. \n\nCurrently, nine Democrats have declared their candidacy for governor, including former U.S. Rep Katie Porter, the presumed front-runner should Harris not run. \n\nNotably, last December, Porter seemed to acknowledge in an interview that Harris’ entrance into the race would be a “field clearing event.” \n\nMore recently however, Porter signaled that she’s done waiting for the former VP to decide. Porter recently told CNN, “This is a moment that calls for leadership, and I am not waiting.”\n\nIn that same vein, other Democrats have expressed frustration with Harris’ indecision. \n\nFormer Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, another candidate, recently said, “The challenges are too big. We deserve a real conversation…So no, you can’t get in at the end of the rainbow. Get in now.” \n\nDonors are frozen as well. One Democratic consultant told Politico that “Donors aren’t going to write [maximum] checks when there’s the prospect for musical chairs.” \n\nHarris’ delay, the consultant continued, “hurts every candidate in the race…she has the luxury of waiting as long as she wants, but I don’t think that’s good for the race, good for the party, or good for the voters.”\n\nIt isn’t just Harris’ indecision that’s angering fellow Democrats, but also her possible motives.\n\nToni Atkins, a former state legislator who is also running, made it clear she thinks Harris views the governorship solely as a steppingstone to Washington. Atkins said, “The next governor must absolutely want to serve as Governor for California and not see the job as a stop along the way.”\n\nCriticism aside, were Harris to officially enter the race, she’d likely be an immediate front runner.\n\nAs CNN has reported, Harris “has seen private poll numbers that show her with essentially universal name recognition and strong approval ratings among Democrats in California.”\n\nPublic polls confirm this as well. \n\nEmerson College surveyed California voters – including Independents and Republicans – and found that Harris (28%) led the field by an incredibly wide margin. No other candidate was in double digits.\n\nWith that in mind, Harris’ appeal may be slowly fading, and the longer she waits, the worse it will likely be.\n\nThe same Emerson poll shows that Californians are split on whether they want Harris to run for governor, with 50% saying yes, and 50% saying no. \n\nFor comparison, immediately after the 2024 election, UK Berkeley polling found that 42% of Californians did not want Harris to run for governor, compared to 46% who did.\n\nEven among Californians who voted for Harris in 2024, the Emerson poll shows that barely a majority (52%) choose her first in a gubernatorial horse race, while roughly one-quarter (24%) don’t think she should run for governor at all. \n\nFurther, it isn’t just politics and timing that could give Harris pause. Being the Governor of California is not an easy job.\n\nThe state is facing a $12 billion budget shortage next year, is dealing with an immense rebuilding effort from the wildfires, and also must prepare to host both the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics.\n\nDealing with all of those issues will require California’s Governor to have a working relationship with President Trump. Current Gov. Gavin Newsom has handled this well, but it’s highly unlikely Harris would be able to walk the same tightrope. \n\nTo be absolutely clear, this is not to disparage former President Biden, who I sincerely wish a speedy recovery. \n\nNonetheless, a considerable number of Independents may have doubts about her, either as a governor or potential presidential candidate.\n\nTo her credit, Harris not only has the infrastructure in place, but also has shown an ability to run a significantly larger campaign in a compressed amount of time. \n\nUltimately however, the longer Harris waits to decide her future, the weaker her position likely becomes, and the more damaging it is for Democrats. \n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"Ultimately however, the longer Harris waits to decide her future, the weaker her position likely becomes, and the more damaging it is for Democrats. ","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/05/26/will-she-or-wont-she-kamala-harris-next-move/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/OCR-L-HARRISEFFECT-0320-04.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-26 19:58:39","author":"Douglas Schoen","authors":["Douglas Schoen"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.06},{"id":325146556,"title":"Kamala Harris Resurfaces in Australia with Confusing Speech","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris left attendees puzzled on Sunday at the Australian Real Estate Conference during a Q&A session, as she tried to relate a ‘humorous’ anecdote about her mother.\n\nHarris spent over an hour speaking with real estate expert John McGrath, reminiscing about how her mother was deeply concerned with women’s reproductive health, often discussing topics like ‘fibroids’ and ‘hormones.’\n\n‘My mother was quite amusing because she would say, ‘When you see the cover of Playboy magazine, remember, the reason people are drawn to these images is to understand how they relate to the continuation of the human race,’ Harris recalled with a laugh. ‘She had a very straightforward approach.’\n\n‘A great lady,’ McGrath replied shortly before shifting immediately to another question.\n\nVideo of the exchange in Australia emerged on social media as an attendee at the conference recorded and shared it. \n\nHarris was spotted at the ritzy Mosman’s Bather’s Pavilion restaurant in Sydney, over the weekend and spoke at the conference which cost between $995 and $1695 for a two-day pass to the event. \n\nHarris also spoke at length about issues important to her but struggled with the concept of humility, circling the idea in a way that suggested she was unclear about what it was.\n\n‘I don’t aspire to be humble.

Latinos moved 17 points [to the right] in eight years. Latino men went 14 points [toward the GOP] in eight years,” Pfieffer said. “Latinos are the fastest-growing population in the country.

Marie Gluesenkamp Perez represents Washington’s 3rd district, a district President Donald Trump won in 2024.\n\nWhile representing a red district in a blue state, the congresswoman who refers to herself as “MGP” is somewhat of an anomaly. She was raised in Texas, the daughter of a Mexican immigrant pastor at an Evangelical church, according to The Chronicle\n\nShe told The Chronicle she was a frequent haunt of both the Young Democrats and the Young Republican clubs while attending high school. She speaks about building coalitions rather than falling behind party lines.\n\n“Extremists do not pass bills in Congress. Work happens in the middle,” she said.\n\n“The rhetoric and the celebrity happens at the extremes, and we’ve got to start electing people that believe in public service again,” she told the outlet.\n\nShe casts herself as a strong supporter of the police and the second amendment. She’s a mechanic by profession and her rhetoric on trade and manufacturing can often sound downright Trumpian.\n\n“Local, union shops like these are how we bring back U.S. manufacturing and rebuild jobs in the trades,” she tweeted in 2024.\n\n My 3rd stop in Vancouver today was veteran-owned Thompson Metal Fab where they’re busy working on some major projects vital to our region’s infrastructure.

Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (@RepMGP) January 3, 2024\n\nLike Trump, she’s been an ardent critic of the Chinese pipeline bringing cheap plastic goods into America. After Trump took on a heavy dose of criticism from MGP’s party over a comment about American children getting less dolls for Christmas, MGP appeared to side with him.\n\n“You’re talking to a lady who doesn’t give my child toys. I’m a big believer in dirt and string and sticks,” she told The New York Times’ (NYT) Ezra Klein in an early May interview.\n\nShe backs the blue, unions, American manufacturing and is not afraid to criticize the left.\n\n“One thing that’s weird is watching the Democratic Party suddenly become the defenders of the stock market and Nasdaq. That’s a weird thing to me,” she told Klein.\n\nAs a Democrat, her views are not all fully aligned with conservative values.\n\nHer opponent in the last two congressional elections, Army veteran and former CIA operative Joe Kent, has accused MGP of having a radical record. In 2020, according to Breitbart, an Instagram post on her family’s mechanic shop’s account allegedly offered free leaf blower tune-ups at a time when members of Antifa were using leaf blowers to repel police tear gas at protests.\n\n She’s also antifa- Perez’s auto shop in Portland supported antifa during the 2020 riots & she is taking their legislative priorities to Congress. https://t.co/msmur9xPjY — Joe Kent (@joekent16jan19) August 10, 2023\n\n A spokesperson for MGP said she had nothing to do with the post and pushed back hard on the notion that she doesn’t support police.\n\n“Any claim Marie or her husband have ever supported Antifa is a lie,” the spokesperson told Breitbart.\n\n“In 2020, as tear gas and pepper spray were causing harm to Portland residents, an employee at Marie’s shop once wrote an Instagram post offering to repair broken leaf blowers. That’s it. Nothing Marie or her husband said or did was in any way anti-law enforcement. Let’s be absolutely clear on this: Marie’s small business has suffered multiple break ins so she knows first hand the important work that police do to protect public safety and address crime. Marie supports fully-funding our police and opposes political violence in all its forms,” the spokesperson said.\n\nMGP does come from the same liberal wing of her party as Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. They both backed self-styled Democratic Socialist and Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential primary. But, unlike AOC, MGP has increasingly voted with Republicans on issues that matter to her constituents.\n\nIn 2024, she was one of five Democrats to vote yes on the End The Border Catastrophe Act, a vote that was consistent with her criticism of former President Joe Biden’s record on immigration. (RELATED: Just Four Dems Vote To Keep Non-Citizens From Voting In US Elections)\n\n“President Biden has failed to end the crisis at our southern border, so I voted to do what he refuses to do: secure our border and stop the violent drug cartels pumping fentanyl into our country,” she said in a statement after the vote.\n\nThough, as Kent pointed out on a website he built to highlight what he calls MGP’s radical record, she also voted no on the 2023 Secure The Border Act.\n\nBut, again siding with mostly Republicans, she voted to censure Democratic Texas Rep.

The money will go towards studying “the syntax, language and content that gains attention and virality in these spaces,” according to the outlet.\n\nWhile the left continues to struggle identifying the root causes of their 2024 electoral failures, MGP continues to vote differently, oftentimes seeming to ignore the tidal direction of her party.\n\nHer rhetoric, focusing on manufacturing and restoring economic agency to homeowners and farmers, is a far cry from many of her peers. While Kamala Harris appeared focused on targeting specific racial groups with proposed policies, MGP appears to be focused on economic empowerment.\n\n“The question is not what the nominal picture of wealth in these terms are, but how much economic agency and self-determination we have,” she told Klein.\n\n“Do you have the power to stay home and spend time with your family?

There are indeed compelling reasons to believe that Vance is the favorite as of now, but also clear obstacles that complicate his path to the 2028 GOP nomination.\n\nFar from a done deal, the GOP race for 2028 is wide open.\n\nVance’s strengths\n\nAs of May 2025, the fundamentals look good for Vance from 30,000 feet. \n\nHistory shows that a winning GOP primary campaign should hope to garner at least 45% of the primary electorate. That number, earned by President Donald Trump in 2016, marks the lowest total won during a contested primary of the past 50 years.\n\nAccording to an Economist/YouGov survey conducted between May 9-12, Vance is viewed favorably by 77% of Republicans, with 51% viewing Vance “very favorably.”\n\nCrucially, Vance is viewed as a Trump loyalist, and in turn, the MAGA base — which is now the GOP base — appears loyal to him. Vance has embraced Trump’s worldview and style wholesale. And thus far, their political partnership has been harmonious, with little daylight appearing between the two in public. \n\nThe only potential moment of incongruity came when the infamous Signal chat emerged, in which Vance had criticized the strikes in Yemen, saying, “I think we are making a mistake,” and that, “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now.” White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller was seen as putting the vice president in his place, writing, “As I heard it, the president was clear.”\n\nBut for the MAGA base’s most prominent influencers, the incident only deepened their affection for Vance, who they view as a bulwark against neoconservative influence within the administration. \n\nVance’s support among these influencers cannot be overstated. Speaking at a recent Heritage Foundation event, Tucker Carlson described Vance as “the future. Period. … JD Vance is the best I’ve ever met. He’s the combination of intelligence, decency, wisdom, emotional self-control.” The influential MAGA darling Laura Loomer, a fervent Vance supporter, recently predicted a Vance-Trump Jr. ticket for 2028. And far-right influencer Jack Posobiec of Pizzagate fame frequently refers to Vance as “48” and sells T-shirts with Vance’s face on them. (Vance appears to return the affection, having blurbed Posobiec’s latest book.)\n\nThe large, engaged audiences of new-Right media figures like Carlson and Posobiec make their endorsements critical in GOP primaries.\n\nVance is also a media machine unto himself. Since stepping onto the national stage last year, no Republican figure, including Trump, has delivered more powerful media moments than Vance. His rebuke of CBS News’s Margaret Brennan, which included the now famous quip, “I don’t really care, Margaret” in response to her criticism of the Trump administration’s pause of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, went super-viral on X and drew over 1.7 million views on YouTube within 24 hours. \n\nThe moment contributed to Vance’s exceptional “memeability” — a powerful attribute in the social media age. His often blunt and polarizing sound bites are the perfect online fodder for a highly engaged MAGA base, deepening his bond with the voters he needs to secure the nomination. \n\nImportantly, Vance’s reputation as a skilled debater cements his frontrunner status in a process heavily influenced by debates. Though his debate resume is limited — the only two of his short political career are his 2022 Senate debate with former Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan and 2024 vice presidential debate against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — his commanding performances in both suggest a mastery of the format. His showing against Walz impressed so much that commentators speculated at the time that the field for 2028 might already be cleared. \n\nCauses for concern\n\nFor all of these formidable strengths, a potential Vance campaign faces significant obstacles. Vice presidents generally have had a difficult time securing their party’s nomination, and even more trouble winning the presidency. Not counting former Vice President Kamala Harris, who was given the nomination without a vote, and former President Joe Biden, whose run came four years after leaving office, only three sitting vice presidents have become their party’s subsequent standard-bearer in the past 50 years: Walter Mondale, George H.W. Bush, and Al Gore — a group that only produced one general election winner. \n\nThe reasons vice presidents struggle here are manifold. For one, they are saddled with the record and popular approval of the outgoing president, and in the modern era, administrations tend to end with a whimper, not a bang. One notable exception is former President Bill Clinton, who, aided by an overzealous impeachment effort by Republicans and a resilient economy, saw his popularity rise in the waning days of his presidency. This aided Gore’s effort to fend off a strong primary challenge from Bill Bradley. The electorate, including primary voters, is often hungry for change after two full terms of a presidency. George H.W. Bush’s successful bid following his stint as Ronald Reagan’s vice president, is the exception, not the rule.\n\nWhether Trump’s second term will end on a soaring note or a nadir will largely be determined by the state of the economy. The tumultuous nature of Trump’s tariff war makes it difficult to forecast. Vance’s fortunes will be tied to the trade war’s outcomes, and perhaps explicitly with whispers that Trump is considering Vance to become the administration’s “tariff czar.” Such an appointment would carry the ultimate boom or bust potential for a 2028 run at the White House.\n\nNumerous other unknowns color the coming primary battle. While Vance appears to have support of the extremely loyal MAGA base, there is plenty of time for Trump and Vance’s relationship to go south. Trump has thus far avoided the highly-publicized breakups with senior officials that plagued his first term, but it is early yet. \n\nVance accusing Trump of ignorance in the Signal chat is an isolated incident insofar as we know. History shows that it doesn’t take much for a Trump insider to become a Trump pariah. \n\nTo be sure, Vance’s standing within the MAGA movement remains entirely in Trump’s hands. It is inconceivable that anyone of whom Trump disapproves could win the 2028 nomination. Friction could emerge between the two on numerous issues. Trump’s openness to an Iran strike, for instance, contrasts sharply with Vance’s stated position. It’s difficult to imagine Vance remaining silent in the event of a strike on Tehran, let alone adopting the administration’s position. \n\nThe issue of life is another area for potential disagreement. Since being tapped as Trump’s vice president, Vance, once a stalwart anti-abortion senator, has adapted his views on access to mifepristone and a national abortion ban. But the heat of a primary, which will include pro-life challengers, could force him to break with the president and cause a potential rift.\n\nSo far, Vance appears to enjoy broad support among the pro-life movement’s leaders despite renouncing his pro-life stances. Vance’s active promotion of in vitro fertilization, a position that conflicts sharply with the Catholic Church and the broader pro-life movement, could also open the door for a pro-life primary challenger to siphon off votes.\n\nVance’s relative youth and political inexperience also raise questions about his inevitability. Vance, whose national political career is only a few years old, has only run two races, both against deeply flawed opponents: Ryan and Harris-Walz. A primary battle against a Republican heavyweight — such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio or Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin — would easily be his most difficult political test. It’s unclear how Vance would hold up during the lengthy primary process against robust competition. \n\nVance’s brand of politics is another area of concern. His obvious intellectual capabilities draw rave reviews from the post-liberal intelligentsia. But his severe demeanor, seen in intense exchanges on social media and in interviews with mainstream journalists, may alienate voters beyond his online base. \n\nAn indispensable aspect of Trump’s political effectiveness is his sense of humor and ability to connect with ordinary people. For every rage-filled, all-caps Truth Social post there’s a genuinely hilarious joke at a MAGA rally or a photo shoot hanging from a McDonald’s window. Vance has not demonstrated the ability to shift gears in this way. It’s one thing to be an impressive intellect and another altogether to be liked. People like Trump. The jury is still out on Vance. \n\nIt’s also unclear what will become of the GOP primary electorate post-Trump. Will MAGA factionalize once its founding father steps off the stage? Will Vance’s high unfavorable ratings — as of today, the RealClearPolitics polling average has Vance’s approval rating at 42% and his disapproval at 45% — enable a primary opponent to credibly argue that he isn’t the party’s best general election nominee? Would the prospect of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as president worry enough primary voters to take this concern seriously? \n\nTrump himself believes the race is wide open as of today. \n\nDONALD TRUMP JR. SAYS ‘MAYBE ONE DAY’ HE’LL RUN FOR PRESIDENT\n\n“You look at Marco, you look at JD Vance, who’s fantastic,” Trump told Kristen Welker recently on Meet the Press. “You look at — I could name 10, 15, 20 people right now just sitting here.”\n\nVance is likely the frontrunner as of now, but with years of uncertainty ahead, Banks’s prediction is premature. The 2028 GOP primary is wide open and many plot twists await between now and Super Tuesday — mark my words.","summary":"Conventional wisdom says the 2028 Republican nomination for president is a lock: Vice President JD Vance will carry the MAGA torch into the GOP’s post-Trump era.  The Washington Examiner’s Byron York reported last week that Sen.

Protection money. Right? It’s protection money.”\n\nHis comments come as Redstone, who stands to personally gain around $2 billion if the Skydance deal goes through, supported the ouster of CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon — a move sources told The Post signals progress in mediation talks aimed at settling Trump’s $20 billion defamation lawsuit against Paramount.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges CBS deceptively edited a “60 Minutes” interview with then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris during the 2024 election cycle.\n\nStewart dismissed the lawsuit as a pretext to extract financial concessions.\n\n“It certainly doesn’t rise to the level of libel, slander or whatever the f–k else they think they’re doing with a $20 billion lawsuit. It was a purely subjective editorial decision,” he said.\n\n“Ultimately, what an awful precedent that these media companies have set.”\n\nMcMahon was reportedly pushed out after resisting efforts to settle with Trump, which insiders say contributed to the resignation of veteran “60 Minutes” producer Bill Owens.\n\nIn her resignation memo, McMahon wrote: “It’s become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward.”\n\nCBS CEO George Cheeks told staff she would remain for several weeks to assist with the transition.\n\nStewart wasn’t subtle in his implication that Redstone was behind the moves, suggesting that top CBS executives were told to issue apologies as part of the merger strategy.\n\n“Imagine paying $50 million for f–king nothing just to get somebody to approve a merger. It’s bribery,” he said.\n\n“They have to apologize. And these people looked at it and thought, ‘There’s no f–king way I’m going to apologize for doing my job the way it’s supposed to be done just because this one guy is offended by it.’”\n\nSources told The Post that Skydance executive Jeff Shell had little confidence in McMahon’s ability to steer CBS News.\n\nHer departure followed multiple controversies, including plummeting ratings, poor newsroom morale and backlash over perceived interference in editorial decisions — such as reprimanding anchor Tony Dokoupil for a tough interview with author Ta-Nehisi Coates on Israel-Hamas tensions.\n\n“I mean, look what they’re doing now at ’60 Minutes’ and CBS News and everything else,” Stewart said.\n\n“I don’t know if these institutions I thought would last my lifetime are going to survive this. It’s insane.”\n\nThe “Daily Show” host broadened his criticism to include other media titans.\n\n“ABC had to pay $15 million. [Amazon founder Jeff] Bezos had to pay $40 million for a documentary on Melania. [Meta CEO Mark] Zuckerberg had to pay,” Stewart said, arguing these were examples of companies bowing to Trump to avoid legal threats.\n\nHe warned that Redstone’s approach sets a dangerous precedent that Trump will exploit further.\n\n“Now he’ll go after Harvard and Comcast or whatever the hell else he does. Because a policy of appeasement always leads to more conquest. It’s tragic,” Stewart said.\n\nThe Post has sought comment from Paramount Global, Meta, Bezos and ABC News.","summary":"Stewart accused his bosses of capitulating to President Trump’s political pressure in order to advance an $8 billion merger with Skydance Media.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/26/media/jon-stewart-blasts-shari-redstone-for-trying-to-settle-trump-lawsuit/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/105357228.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-26 16:19:55","author":"Ariel Zilber","authors":["Ariel Zilber"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.362},{"id":325097038,"title":"Former Obama advisor says Dems in 'huge bit of trouble' if they can't win Latinos back","text":"Ex-Obama senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer warned on Friday that there is \"no path\" for Democrats to win elections unless they address their rapidly declining Latino vote.

'I am actively a cancer patient right now. I also feel great.' \n\n'Cancer is a very complicated disease. It's very hard to speculate why he wasn't screened … I think that the idea that this was a coverup of a cancer diagnosis seems quite unlikely,' she said.\n\nHer comments came after conservative commentator Clay Travis argued that Biden would have been forced to resign due to his recent prostate cancer diagnosis.\n\n'And I just think we're very lucky as a country that Donald Trump is in office because otherwise, I think Joe Biden would have to step down and Kamala Harris would be elevated,' Travis said.\n\n'And we just saw that the nation, overwhelmingly, all 50 states, moved against her compared to 2020.

It is the most male-specific health-related blood test you can do,' a senior surgeon told The Telegraph. \n\n'If you get an abnormal result, then you do a scan (I imagine the White House has an MRI scanner) and then after that you do a biopsy. It is not as if we throw drugs at anyone with a high PSA, but I simply cannot envision a world where nobody at the White House ever ticked yes to a PSA test for him.'\n\nBiden's cancer announcement last week led to an outpouring support for the former commander-in-chief, though many remain skeptical about the timeline of his diagnosis.","summary":"A Fox News panelist has made a startling personal revelation while defending former President Joe Biden's health fitness for office.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14750459/fox-news-lucy-caldwell-revelation-biden-served-president-cancer-diagnosis.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/26/14/98758703-0-image-m-12_1748264852907.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-26 14:51:21","author":"Editor,Noa Halff","authors":["Editor","Noa Halff"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.603},{"id":325154390,"title":"The privatization of media and the death of public interest","text":"In February, Common Cause ran an ad in The Washington Post criticizing Elon Musk’s outsized role in the Trump administration. As a “special government employee,” Musk was empowered to illegally fire millions and fundamentally reshape the federal government. Our editorial posed an obvious question: Who is in charge of our country? The weekend before the ad was set to print, the billionaire-owned paper backtracked and pulled it from publication at the last minute, a move that raised concerns about free speech and the ability of institutional media to hold power — and billionaires — to account. \n\nA free press is critical to our democracy, and we must do everything in our power to preserve it. But what happens when billionaires and megarich corporations own and operate most channels of communication and information sharing? Americans are finding out in real time. \n\nBefore pulling out of the “Fire Elon Musk” advertisement, Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos axed the paper’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris. The Los Angeles Times followed suit. More recently, The Washington Post pulled a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist’s work when it mocked media and tech titans groveling at the feet of President Donald Trump. On the nose, much? \n\nThese capitulations by the traditional pillars of our free press have further enabled the new administration to attack our media. When the Associated Press refused to acknowledge the “Gulf of America,” they were blocked from the White House briefing room for weeks. When Amber Ruffin, host of CNN’s “Have I Got News for You” and comedian MC at this year’s White House Correspondents Dinner, indicated she’d poke fun at President Trump, she was fired from the event. Now, not even six months into this new administration, President Trump has signed an executive order to defund PBS and NPR, a direct attack on fact-based and free public media. \n\nTrump’s pressure and intimidation of the media hasn’t stopped. Most recently, Wendy McMahon, president of CBS News, resigned amidst pressure from President Trump, CBS and its parent company, Paramount. McMahon isn’t the only one who was recently threatened for merely alerting the public to the administration’s questionable actions. ABC News is now under fire for its coverage of the luxury jet from Qatar – another instance of Trump targeting media outlets for exposing questionable actions by his administration.\n\nAt the community level, local news has been dying over the last decade, leaving behind news deserts nationwide. From traditional, smaller print outlets unable to keep up in the digital age to hedge funds systemically buying out and gutting local papers, communities are being robbed of their access to timely updates and honest reporting on their local governments. Public broadcasting organizations like PBS and NPR have been filling the void for millions of Americans who keep up with the news from their local public broadcasting stations.\n\nOur social media platforms aren’t safe either, with billionaires — often big political donors — owning and controlling the ways our information spreads online. When oligarchs with vested interests in certain agendas control the channels of communication, they have power over what we say, what we see and, by extension, what constitutes truth. \n\nOn January 6, Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, announced that it was ending fact-checking on its platforms – a program that was proven to be “effective at reducing belief in falsehoods and reducing how often such content is shared.” Facebook also recently paid Trump $25 million to settle an old lawsuit stemming from its decision to ban Trump’s accounts after the January 6 insurrection. \n\nA few weeks later, Google said it wouldn’t integrate fact-checking into its search engine or YouTube. As these new rules went into effect, the leaders of these very tech companies had front row seats to President Trump’s inauguration. Major tech companies, including their CEOs, each donated $1 million to the Trump inauguration fund. \n\nHow can public interest prevail on platforms and in outlets that are privately owned? Much like the hedge funds that have gutted local news, special interests and unelected CEOs want to dismantle pillars of our democracy and sell its parts to the highest bidder at the expense of the people. \n\nSince 2010, Americans have seen big money exponentially poison our politics with the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling that opened the floodgates to unlimited political spending by corporations and special interests. It’s clear that money doesn’t just buy a seat at the table anymore — it buys every seat, the table and the entire White House, too. \n\nThe 2024 elections were a testament to this, standing as the costliest election in American history, with nearly $16 billion spent nationwide and an additional $5 billion coming from outside sources. The top five mega-donors each donated more than $100 million to influence the elections. \n\nIt’s true that democracy dies in darkness. It also withers behind a paywall, is manipulated by social media algorithms and hollowed out by covert corporate consolidation. The shadow cast by self-interested billionaires grows larger by the day, muzzling any truth that conflicts with their bottom line. But that isn’t the end of the story. \n\nOrganizations like Common Cause and the Southern Poverty Law Center are committed to cutting a different path by shining a light through the darkness. From helping everyday people make their voices heard and offering local solutions that empower small-dollar donors, to removing the financial barriers stopping regular people from running for office, increasing government transparency and preserving the local media ecosystem, we can and will continue to hold power to account.","summary":"Democracy dies when billionaires own and threaten media","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/05/26/the-privatization-of-media-and-the-of-public-interest/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2025/01/donald_trump_jeff_bezos_mark_zuckerberg_elon_musk_1242798529_1032942562_180336897_2169754060.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-26 14:25:57","author":"Virginia Kase Solom,Virginia Kase Solomón","authors":["Virginia Kase Solom","Virginia Kase Solomón"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.024},{"id":325067946,"title":"FBI revisiting Biden White House cocaine find, Dobbs leak and Jan. 6 pipe bombs","text":"Three of the biggest unsolved mysteries in recent political history are being reviewed by the FBI, deputy director Dan Bongino announced Monday. \n\nBongino, a former NYPD officer, Secret Service agent and conservative commentator, revealed on X that he and bureau Director Kash Patel had decided to “either re-open, or push additional resources and investigative attention” to the discovery of cocaine in the West Wing during the Biden administration, the leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, and the planting of pipe bombs outside the Democratic and Republican national committees hours before the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.\n\n“I receive requested briefings on these cases weekly and we are making progress,” Bongino added in his post. “If you have any investigative tips on these matters that may assist us then please contact the FBI.”\n\nCracking the case\n\nOn July 2, 2023, a dime-sized bag of cocaine was discovered in the West Wing, forcing the evacuation of the White House.\n\nA Secret Service agent had discovered the illegal drug in a cubby located in a vestibule one floor below the Oval Office and steps from the Situation Room during a routine sweep of the premises.\n\nThen-President Joe Biden and his family, including first son Hunter Biden — who had struggled with crack addiction in the past — were at Camp David at the time to mark Independence Day weekend.\n\nAfter 11 days of investigating, the Secret Service wrapped up its probe without identifying a suspect “due to a lack of physical evidence” and a supposed lack of cameras to capture who may have dropped off the baggy.\n\nPresident Trump speculated in February that “either Joe or Hunter” left the illegal drug in the executive mansion.\n\nIn May 2022, Politico published a leaked draft of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito’s opinion in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Healthcare, upholding a Mississippi law banning abortion after 15 weeks and leaving regulation of the procedure up to each state.\n\nThe stunning leak set off protests at the homes of conservative justices and represented a devastating breach of long-respected confidentiality surrounding the high court’s deliberations. \n\nIn the end, Alito’s opinion hewed closely to the leaked draft, with the justice writing at one point: “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and [Planned Parenthood v.] Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.”\n\nChief Justice John Roberts promptly ordered an investigation, but after eight months, Marshal of the Supreme Court Gail Curley said in January 2023 that she and the court’s internal police force had been unable to identify the leaker. \n\nDC pipe bomber\n\nOn the night of Jan. 5, 2021, someone carrying a backpack and wearing a grey-hooded sweatshirt, mask, gloves, glasses, and a pair of Nike Air Max Speed Turf sneakers dropped two pipe bombs outside Republican and Democratic headquarters in the nation’s capital.\n\nWhile the explosives did not detonate, the FBI assessed that they were “viable.”\n\nThen-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris visited the Democratic National Committee headquarters the next day, shortly before the Capitol riot began, and was evacuated after the pipe bombs were identified by a passerby.\n\nThe FBI has released surveillance footage and other evidence to the public in a bid to get assistance in identifying the suspect. \n\nIn a House GOP report released in early 2025, lawmakers claimed initial inquiries “yielded a promising array of data and revealed numerous persons of interest” — but “little meaningful progress” has been made since.\n\nThe bureau is offering a $500,000 award for information leading to a suspect’s capture and conviction.","summary":"The FBI is revisiting the Biden-era White House cocaine scandal, Dobbs v.

Far more important is, “Should she?” And that’s not a question to be answered based strictly on her prospects for winning. Initially, at least, the former vice president would be the heavy favorite to succeed termed-out Gov. Gavin Newsom — although, eventually, she could find herself in a tough election fight next year. Rather, the answer should be determined based on what strengths, goals and ideas she would bring to the table — her specific plans for fixing California’s enormous problems, her eagerness to fight even political allies to achieve her objectives and her own desire to lead the state’s comeback. She shouldn’t view the job as a consolation prize after losing the presidential election to Donald Trump. Voters would smell that and, anyway, Harris would be miserably bored in the state Capitol dealing with budget minutiae and relatively inexperienced legislative leaders. So far, since returning from Washington to her native state, Harris, 60, has displayed none of the above criteria that California needs in its next governor. But neither did she previously in any noteworthy way as a U.S. senator or — particularly — state attorney general. As attorney general, Harris refused to take positions on important ballot measures, including those dealing with her role as California’s so-called top cop — propositions to stiffen criminal sentences and both abolish and expedite the death penalty. Harris has a record of being overly cautious about taking positions that could alienate interests she deems important to her political career. Sure, Harris isn’t running for anything right now. So, she deserves a pass on issuing 10-point plans to patch up the state. But, look, you don’t need to be a gubernatorial candidate to express concerns about your state. Any resident who’s conscious should be alarmed. “Home prices have skyrocketed as supply slumped over the past three decades,” the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California noted in a report last week. California’s median home price in March was $884,000 — very tough if not impossible for many middle-class families. The housing shortage is largely due to over-regulation, tangled red tape that slows issuance of building permits and abuse of California’s environmental protection laws. There’s a strong move in the Legislature to ease regulations, but it’s highly controversial. Does Harris have a thought on this? Homeowner insurance rates are rising fast in the aftermath of wildfires. And in many fire-prone regions, traditional policies are impossible to obtain. The next governor needs to fix this. California’s poverty rate is the nation’s highest when the cost of living is considered, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Despite our spending many billions of dollars and regardless of ugly finger-pointing at each other by Newsom and local officials, 187,000 Californians are homeless — a 35% increase in 17 years. That’s the highest in the nation — only partly because we’ve got the largest population. Gasoline prices are roughly $1.60 a gallon higher in California than the U.S. average. And two oil refineries are planning to shut down, invariably hiking pump prices even higher. We’re a high-tax state, a fact Newsom is in denial about. We lean too heavily on the wealthy for tax revenue and that produces roller-coaster budget deficits and surpluses depending on the stock market. It’s ridiculous. State taxes should be modernized. But no politician has the guts to attempt that. Then there’s California’s historic problem of not enough water for its thirst. Does Harris have anything to say about any of this? She hasn’t so far. Of course, the seven leading announced Democratic candidates have been practically mute themselves on matters that risk aggravating party interest groups. One exception is former Los Angeles Mayor and state Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, who has been bolder than most of his rivals. Harris has said she’ll decide by the end of summer whether to run for governor in 2026. Maybe she’ll seek the presidency again in 2028 or retire from politics and make a bundle in the private sector. But Villaraigosa already is taking shots at her — including last week for allegedly helping to cover up former President Biden’s cognitive decline while in the Oval Office. Villaraigosa included in the attack another gubernatorial candidate: former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra. Harris is a lot more vulnerable than Becerra on the issue. But it’s a cheap shot. How many people would publicly accuse their boss of being mentally incompetent? And Harris would have instantly been blasted for being self-serving by plotting to push the president aside so she could grab the Democratic nomination. Harris could help herself and California’s voters, however, by occasionally voicing some anxiety about her home state. The little we’ve heard from her this year are attacks on Trump. She also has been lending her name to anti-Trump fundraising appeals by the Democratic National Committee. But the last thing California Democrats need is another politician — especially a potential governor — telling them that Trump is an evil, ignorant con artist. They’re fully aware of that. They need someone who can tell them how their state can be fixed. If she ran, Harris would be the initial favorite because of her broad name recognition, past election successes in California and fundraising ability. Some current candidates would probably drop out. But there doesn’t seem to be a public clamoring for her to run. Harris needs to start showing people why she should even consider seeking the job. Because, so far, she’s sounding more like a 2028 presidential retread.

The Democratic Party’s hopes that President Donald Trump’s job approval rating would zoom down toward zero have been temporarily frustrated, as it has risen slightly in May and is higher than at any point in his first term.\n\nTo illustrate the pickle Democrats are in, it’s helpful to provide a little historical perspective, at least as far back as a dozen years, on the very different political climate following the 2012 election. That saw the third consecutive reelection of an incumbent president, something not seen since 1820.\n\nThe respected Democrat pollster Stanley Greenberg argued that Democrats’ increased support from college graduates, plus huge margins from blacks, Hispanics, and young people, would form a “coalition of the ascendant” dominant for years to come.\n\nGreenberg was right about trends up to that point. However, he failed to account for the Newtonian law that says for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. His coalition spurred a coalition of the nonascendant. White non-college-educated people living outside million-dollar-plus metropolitan areas spurned Democrats and elected Trump over Hillary Clinton. A similar coalition in Britain produced the unexpected victory for Brexit five months before.\n\nBy 2024, after one term each from Trump and Biden, that movement continued, including among non-college-educated Hispanics, Asians, and blacks. Figures compiled by the Democrat firm Catalist and spotlighted by Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini showed Republicans gaining 36 points among Latinos aged 18 to 29, 33 points among black men, and 30 points among non-college-educated Asians between 2012 and 2024.\n\nIn the process, the Democratic Party has become increasingly dominated by white college-educated people, who reliably turn out to vote, contribute lots of money, and have poor judgment about what matters will appeal to majorities of the entire electorate. As the financial adviser Dave Ramsey put it, “The hardest people to convince to use common sense are the smart people.”\n\nHigh-education voters, repelled by Trump’s crudeness, provided the enthusiasm behind the Russia collusion hoax and the various lawfare prosecutions and attempts to remove Trump from office somehow. They provided the impetus behind the flawed “science” to extend school closings and other undue COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nAfter George Floyd’s death in May 2020, they gave support or silent acquiescence to radical calls for defunding the police, to reparations for descendants of slaves, and to continued racial quotas and preferences—all positions opposed by large majorities of voters. Biden, having secured the nomination after winning the majority-black South Carolina primary, felt obliged to name a black woman for vice president, although the party nominated a black presidential candidate twice in the previous three contests.\n\nIn a process described by Greg Schultz, manager of Biden’s 2020 primary campaign, the voters and officeholders of what he called “the (mostly) safe middle” of the party have embraced or accepted policies advocated by “the (much smaller) far Left,” but that actively repel “the majority-makes” whose votes Democratic candidates need to win.\n\nThat didn’t happen when “the (mostly) safe middle” was typified by Richard Scammon and Ben Wattenberg’s non-college-educated housewife from Dayton married to a machinist. However, it has happened now that the voter looks like the college-educated professional woman married to a lawyer in the affluent suburbs of Philadelphia.\n\nYou can see how this works out on controversial transgender matters. College-educated Democrats, noting the public majorities favoring same-sex marriage, have enthusiastically backed stands supported by transgender advocates and expressed scorn for the few elected Democrats opposing them. They have failed to reflect that it took 22 years from Andrew Sullivan’s 1989 New Republic article advocating same-sex marriage to the first Gallup poll showing a national majority in favor.\n\nThose two decades included partisan and civil arguments from Sullivan and Jonathan Rauch that marriage would consensitize gays and need not affect others, just as standard wedding etiquette allows you to decline an invitation without giving a reason or a gift.\n\nIn contrast, transgender activists impinge on others. They insist that inevitably more muscular biological men must compete in female sports, and they pummel the rare Democrat, such as Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., when they question that. As transgender demands have become better known, they have lost support, as Pew Research reported.\n\nMost voters are motivated by concrete concerns—direct economic interests and ethnic or racial concerns. College-educated voters tend to have more theoretical concerns. Sometimes they may alert others to injustice and persuade them to address it, such as supporters of equal rights for blacks. The danger is that their high regard for their own views leads them to take impolitic stands, such as former Vice President Kamala Harris’ support of government-paid transgender surgeries for prisoners and illegal immigrants.\n\nEvery political party must strike some balance between the demands of its core constituencies and the beliefs of voters. That’s hard for a party dominated by college-educated activists with theoretical rather than practical concerns. The Democratic Party today, with its discredited leadership and its college-educated core, seems badly off kilter.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

On Thursday, 27 groups, including Students for Life Action, wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-ID), and other senators, pressing for the defunding of Planned Parenthood.\n\n“We, the undersigned individuals and organizations, respectfully urge the United States Senate to actimmediately to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood,” the signees wrote. “This language is currently included in the reconciliation package before you. This provision must be kept and passed.” \n\nThe letter also slammed the organization over its efforts to provide “gender-affirming care” for transgender and nonbinary patients.\n\n“By expanding into the gender-transition industry, it compounds its record of harm by pushing sterilizing drugs on minors for profit,” the letter states. “While committing these atrocities, Planned Parenthood receives nearly $800 million annually in taxpayer dollars: a staggering figure that should alarm every American.”\n\nThe Senate is expected to revise key components of the House bill, including other changes to Medicaid. In past Congresses, the language to defund has been removed.\n\nThe current House-passed bill blocks support to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers that received more than $1 million in Medicaid funding in 2024. There are exceptions for clinics that help women who are pregnant as a result of rape or incest or are suffering from a life-threatening medical emergency.\n\nRepublicans were forced to strip language defunding Planned Parenthood in 2017, after the Senate parliamentarian ruled that it violated the Byrd Rule, which prohibits “extraneous” provisions in budget legislation.\n\nAbortion opponents are also expected to face pushback from two centrist Republicans: Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK).\n\nStill, the fight over Planned Parenthood has been overshadowed by flashpoints over Medicaid funding, with House Republicans passing reforms that would remove health coverage for millions of recipients. Collins told reporters earlier this month that she isn’t drawing any red lines at this point and reiterated that her primary concern is the benefit cuts.\n\nAnti-abortion groups also have the support of Senate leadership, with Thune attending this year’s March for Life, plus the sway of Trump in the White House.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump would not allow federal funding to go toward transgender procedures during a Thursday press briefing.\n\n“The president has maintained a very clear commitment to ensuring that this administration and the American people’s tax dollars are not funding any institution. That includes hospital systems that are funding the chemical castration and mutilation of children,” Leavitt said. “We’re not going to tolerate taxpayer dollars going to such efforts.”\n\nAccording to a 2023-2024 Planned Parenthood report, 39% of its revenue comes from government health services reimbursements and grants. Another 34% comes from private contributions and bequests, 17% is from nongovernment health services funding, and 10% is from other revenue.\n\nA May KFF health tracking poll showed 32% of women have gone to a Planned Parenthood clinic for care, while 11% of men said the same. Nearly half of black women, 45%, said they had visited one of the group’s clinics. Additionally, 43% of people with Medicaid visited a clinic compared to 33% of those with private insurance.\n\nSocial conservatives pointed to a New York Times report that showed cash-strapped Planned Parenthood clinics were providing subpar care to patients. \n\n“By stripping Planned Parenthood of federal funds, we expose its reliance on taxpayer dollars amid a troubling record of malpractice and ethical failures,” Penny Nance, CEO and president of Concerned Women for America LAC, told the Washington Examiner.\n\n“There’s no doubt that Planned Parenthood is harmful and abusing our taxpayer dollars,” added Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, in a statement.\n\nDannenfelser called the New York Times story a “grisly” account that details “atrocious conditions nationwide like botched abortions and leaking sewage” before pushing for alternative resources. “In stark contrast, community health centers offer greater access and actual comprehensive women’s healthcare. And they outnumber Planned Parenthood locations 15-to-1 across the country.”\n\nHOUSE MOVES TO STRIP PLANNED PARENTHOOD FUNDING AS PART OF TRUMP MEGABILL\n\nPlanned Parenthood advocacy organizations spent a record-breaking $69.5 million during the 2024 election cycle to boost former Vice President Kamala Harris’s unsuccessful campaign. The Democratic focus on preserving abortion rights helped motivate turnout in 2022 in light of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, but Trump’s insistence on keeping restrictions a state matter helped insulate Republicans in 2024, and he comfortably won a second term in November.\n\nIn 2024, Planned Parenthood performed 402,200 abortions, 5.1 million STI tests and treatments, 2.2 million birth control services, and 364,600 Pap tests and breast exams.\n\nAccording to the organization, a third of its health centers across the nation could close if the tax legislation becomes law.\n\n“Nearly 200 Planned Parenthood health centers could be forced to shutter, and more than 1.1 million patients could lose access to care,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in a statement. “Cancers will go undetected, STIs will go untreated, and birth control will be harder to get — all while charging the taxpayers nearly $300 million to do it.” \n\nShould the Senate keep the provision stripping Medicaid reimbursement in its legislation, anti-abortion advocates say the fight against Planned Parenthood would move to another phase: barring the federal government from doing business with the organization.\n\n“Then we are going to turn to the issue of debarment, because the way to get them 100% out is to debar them as a bad actor,” said Hamrick, with Students for Life.","summary":"The pressure campaign to defund Planned Parenthood is headed to the Senate as Republicans usher a major tax bill through Congress.

A former Kentucky Supreme Court justice, the 70-year-old Stumbo said the event was “the biggest Democratic gathering I have ever seen in Johnson County,” an enclave where Republican Donald Trump got 85% of the presidential vote in November. Paintsville, the county seat, was the latest stop on the state party’s “Rural Listening Tour,” a periodic effort to visit overwhelmingly white, culturally conservative towns of the kind where Democrats once competed and Republicans now dominate nationally. Democrats' path back to power may start in places like Paintsville, one small meeting at a time, because it may be difficult for the party to regain control of Congress or the White House without faring better among rural and small-town voters across the country. The party recently lost U.S. senators from states with significant rural populations: Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Also, Democratic-led states are losing population to Sun Belt states led by Republicans, with some projections suggesting changes after the 2030 census could cost Democrats 12 electoral college votes. “The gut check is we’d stopped having these conversations” in white rural America, said Colmon Elridge, the Kentucky Democratic chair. “Folks didn’t give up on the Democratic Party. We stopped doing the things that we knew we needed to do.” It’s not that Democrats must carry most white rural precincts to win more elections. It's more a matter of consistently chipping away at Republican margins in the way Trump narrowed Democrats’ usual advantages among Black and Latino men in 2024, and not unlike what Kentucky’s Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, did in two statewide victories. Nationally, Trump won 60% of small-town and rural voters when he lost reelection in 2020 — and 63% in his 2024 victory, according to AP VoteCast data. That's a far cry from a generation ago, when Democrat Bill Clinton won pluralities in Johnson County on his way to capturing Kentucky's electoral votes in the 1992 and 1996 White House races. “We have to be intentional about how we build something sustainable,” Elridge said. “It’s not like we haven’t won here before.” For two hours in downtown Paintsville, Elridge listened as Stumbo and others took umbrage at conservatives' policy agenda, expressed frustration over President Trump’s standing in eastern Kentucky and said they were determined to sell their neighbors an alternative. Many brought their personal experiences to bear. The event was part town hall, part catharsis, part pep talk. In some ways, the complaints in Paintsville mirrored how Democrats nationally are angry, often for very different reasons. Sandra Music, a retired teacher who called herself “a new Democrat,” converted because of Trump. She bemoaned conservatives’ success in advancing private school tuition voucher programs and said they were threatening a public education system “meant to ensure we educate everybody.” Music criticized Republicans for making a “caricature” of Democrats. “They want to pull out keywords: 'abortion,' 'transgender,' 'boys in girls’ sports'” and distract from the rest of the Republican agenda, she said. Stumbo, the former justice, lamented what she called the rightward lurch of the state and federal courts. “We are going to suffer irreparable damage,” she said, “if we don’t stop these conservative idiots.” Michael Halfhill, who works in healthcare information technology, was incredulous that the billionaire president has taken hold of voters in Appalachia, historically one of the country’s poorest regions. “It’s not left versus right. It’s rich versus poor,” he said, shaking his head at working-class white voters — Johnson County is 97.5% white — “voting against themselves.” Ned Pillersdorf, who is married to Stumbo, went after Republicans for their proposed federal tax and spending plans, especially potential cuts to Medicaid. He said Paintsville still has a rural hospital, which is among the largest employers in the region, in no small part because Kentucky is among the GOP-leaning states where a Democratic governor expanded Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Elridge, the first Black chair of a major party in Kentucky, mentioned Trump’s attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and related civil rights laws and regulations. “This is where Trump and MAGA excel — if somebody who looks like me is your enemy, then you don’t care if the guy in the White House is peeing on your leg and telling you it’s rain,” he said, referring to Trump's “Make American Great Again” movement. By definition, a “listening tour” is not meant to produce concrete action. Elridge and Nicholas Hazelett, the Johnson County Democratic chair who is a college student and a Paintsville City Council member, acknowledged that the small crowd was Democrat-friendly. Despite a few recent converts, no one was there waiting to be convinced. Across the street, antiques shop owner Michelle Hackworth said she did not even know Democrats were holding a meeting. Calling herself a “hard-core Republican,” she smiled when asked if she would consider attending. “They wouldn’t convince me of anything,” she said. Bill Mike Runyon, a self-described conservative Republican who is Paintsville's mayor and loves Trump, went immediately to social and cultural commentary when asked in an interview to explain Johnson County politics. Democrats, he said, “have to get away from the far-left radical — look at the transgender message.” Further, Runyon said, “everything got kind of racial. It’s not like that here in Paintsville and in Johnson County, but I can see it as a country. … It’s making people more racist against one another.” Asked specifically who he was talking about, he alluded to progressive U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Latina from New York City, and Jasmine Crockett, a Black woman from Texas. “It’s the ones you always see on TV,” the mayor said. Beshear seems to be the one Democrat who commands wide respect in and around Paintsville. Democrats hailed the 47-year-old governor for supporting abortion and LGBTQ+ rights while still attracting support beyond the Democratic strongholds of Louisville, Lexington and Frankfort. Beshear did not win Johnson County but got 37% of the vote in his 2023 reelection. He carried several nearby counties. Many Republicans, including the mayor, complimented Beshear for his handling of floods and other disasters in the region. “He’s been here,” Runyon said. “I absolutely can get to him if I need him.” In 2024, Beshear landed on the list of potential vice presidential running mates for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. He also remains Senate Democrats’ top pick for a 2026 campaign for the seat coming open with Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell’s retirement. Beshear, whose father once lost to McConnell after having won two governor's races, has said he will not run for Senate. But he has stepped up his cable TV interviews and launched his own podcast, fueling speculation that his next campaign will be for the 2028 presidential nomination. “Andy is not like those national Democrats,” Runyon said. Harking back to the 1990s, he added, “Bill Clinton wasn't like these Democrats today.” Hackworth, the shop owner, noted that she voted against the younger Beshear twice. But over the course of an extended interview, she, too, commended the governor's disaster management. She also questioned some moves by Trump, including the idea of getting Washington completely out of the disaster aid business. She blamed Trump’s predecessor, former President Biden, for a “tough time at my store,” but acknowledged that federal aid had helped many businesses and households stay afloat through the COVID-19 pandemic emergency. Hackworth said she was not familiar with details of Medicaid expansion, but she identified the nearby hospital as among the area’s largest employers. The others, she said, are the public school system and Walmart, which a day earlier had announced it was increasing prices because of Trump’s tariffs. While supporting Trump’s “America first” agenda, Hackworth said widespread tariffs would upset many consumers. “You can walk through my store and see where the new stuff is made,” she said. “I try to buy American, but so much of it is China, China, China.” Asked again whether any of that should give Democrats an opening in places like Paintsville, she said, “Well, there’s always an opening if you show up.” Barrow writes for the Associated Press.","summary":"Kentucky Democrats are trying to address the party's steep deficits in overwhelmingly white, conservative pockets of rural America.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-05-26/democrats-path-back-to-power-might-start-in-places-like-this-appalachian-town","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1970fea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3851x2022+0+364/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0c%2F04%2F9fc3e0279f61b5e6e75d0973eff5%2Fca9f598006024fe88020","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-26 10:00:00","author":"Bill Barrow","authors":["Bill Barrow"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":324948896,"title":"Curley: Dems look to make like Biden, and forget","text":"In 2014, when asked about the Patriots’ brutal loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, Bill Belichick repeatedly told reporters in his typical dead-pan fashion, “We’re on to Cincinnati.”\n\nIn 2025, the Democrat party seems to be taking a page out of Bill’s playbook.\n\n“We’re looking forward,” an irritated Senator Chuck Schumer recently told CNN’s Katie Hunt when asked about his knowledge of Former President Joe Biden’s cognitive decline.\n\nThe next day, on the same network, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries was confronted with a similar question.

For example, the J.L. Partners/Daily Mail poll, conducted between May 13 and 14 among 1,003 registered voters, showed that Trump's approval rating among 18-29 year olds jumped 6 points from the previous poll, when it stood at 44 percent.An even bigger increase was seen in the latest YouGov/Economist poll, conducted between May 19 and 16 among 1,710 adults. In the survey, Trump's approval rating among Gen Z voters jumped 7 points, from 28 percent last week to 35 percent this week. Meanwhile, his disapproval rating dropped by 11 points to 51 percent.The latest InsiderAdvantage/Trafalgar Group poll, conducted between May 17 and 19 among 1,000 likely voters, showed a smaller increase of 2 points, with 52 percent of 18- 39-year-olds (which also includes millennials) approving of Trump's job performance.It comes after last week's YouGov/Economist poll showed that Trump's approval rating among millennials had made a sharp rebound. Americans aged 30 to 44 approved of Trump's job performance by 46 percent in May, up from 38 percent in April, although the latest poll showed that it had dropped to 42 percent.Trump's bounce-back with young voters comes after weeks of sagging numbers tied to economic anxiety and fallout from his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs. The policy move rattled markets, prompting a sharp sell-off before an eventual recovery. But public sentiment did not rebound as quickly as the Dow. Polls throughout April showed sliding approval ratings—not only for Trump's overall job performance but also for his handling of the economy.However, the polls now suggest that the bleeding has stopped.Melissa Deckman and Lucas Walsh, experts in generational voting trends, told Newsweek that this has less to do with deepening alignment with Trump's agenda among young voters than it is a reflection of their disillusionment with Democratic leadership, frustration with the economy, and, therefore, growing distrust in traditional politics.\"Compared with older Americans, Gen Z is far less trustful of political institutions, so their inability to afford rent and pay back their college loans, amidst a tough market, was the biggest factor shaping their vote decision (in 2024),\" Deckman, the CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, said.Between 2020 and 2024, both rent and student loan debts in the U.S. experienced notable increases, impacting young Americans' financial burdens.According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the cost of renting a primary residence rose by approximately 22.6 percent from 2020 to 2024. This means that a rental costing $1,000 in 2020 would have increased to about $1,226 by 2024.However, other analyses suggest even steeper increases. Zillow reported that average apartment rents increased by 29 percent, and single-family home rents surged by 43 percent since April 2020.During the same period, student loan debt also saw significant growth. The total national student loan debt increased from approximately $1.69 trillion in 2020 to about $1.78 trillion in 2024, marking a 5.1 percent rise. Such increases can be partly attributed to inflation, which peaked at 9.1 percent in 2022.Trump has repeatedly sought to blame his predecessor for inflation. In the 2024 presidential debates, Trump accused then-President Joe Biden of \"destroying the economy,\" alleging that inflation reached unprecedented levels under their leadership.Deckman suggested that this kind of rhetoric sowed the seed of distrust in the Democratic Party among young people in 2024. Polls show that since Trump began his second term, the Democrats have failed to regain that trust.\"It is pretty clear that younger voters have soured on Democrats last election cycle,\" Deckman said.Polls conducted in the wake of Trump's win have shown that the Democrats are more unpopular than ever. And that is also true among young people.The 50th edition of the Harvard Youth Poll, which surveyed 2,096 Americans aged 18-29 in April via Ipsos Public Affairs' Knowledge Panel, found that just 23 percent of young Americans (ages 18-29) approve of congressional Democrats, down sharply from 42 percent in spring 2017.The poll also found that young voters increasingly see Republicans as better on the economy. Many criticize Democrats for being \"elitist\" (51 percent), overly focused on \"political correctness\" (70 percent) and prioritizing \"other people\" over their concerns (54 percent), according to the poll.Additionally, a Yale Youth Poll, which surveyed 4,100 registered voters between April 1 and April 3, including an oversample of 2,024 voters aged 18-29, showed that young voters are now overwhelmingly Republican. Voters aged 18-21 leaned Republican by 11.7 points when asked who they would support in the 2026 Congressional elections, while voters aged 22-29 favored Democrats by 6.4 points.Lucas Walsh, who is a professor at Monash University in Australia, said that dissatisfaction with the Democratic party among young people does not fully explain why they are increasingly supporting Trump.\"We can attribute some of this surge to dissatisfaction with the Democrats at the last election, but most young voters have a distrust in government,\" Monash said. The Harvard Youth Poll found that only 19 percent of young voters trust the federal government.He added that such distrust in government is at the heart of why young people are increasingly leaning Republican.\"Perhaps it is Trump's image of disrupting Washington orthodoxies that is appealing to this longer term distrust in federal government,\" he said.A Young Men Research Initiative (YMRI) study showed that social media has played a big role in eroding trust in politicians among male Gen Z voters. Platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram serve as key news sources for young men, and algorithmic amplification of negative content often erodes confidence in whoever is in power.During his campaign, Trump capitalized on this, appearing on The Joe Rogan Experience, the Shawn Ryan Show, Theo Von's podcast and Lex Fridman's podcast. All four podcasts draw a largely young, male audience. Deckman said this was a \"smart decision\" by Trump.\"Gen Z rejects legacy media at higher rates than older Americans and it was a smart strategy of the Trump campaign to make direct appeals to young men on digital shows hosted by Joe Rogan, Theo Von, Logan Paul, and others that have a predominantly male, younger audience last fall,\" she said.Meanwhile, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris declined to appear on The Joe Rogan Experience, a decision YMRI co-founder Jackson Katz previously told Newsweek he found \"disappointing.\"\"I think that would have been a very powerful statement to young men,\" he said.\n\"It would have been a statement to them that she sees them, she cares about them, and she wants to do whatever she can to help them. Because I think a big part of the narrative that's emerged over the last decade is that Democrats hate white men, or they don't care about white men. They don't care about the struggles of white men, especially young white men. And I think that's completely untrue.\"Since Trump took office again, he has continued to sow distrust in traditional institutions, including the press. In March 2025, he escalated his attacks by suggesting that major news outlets like CNN and MSNBC were engaging in illegal activities, a claim lacking substantiation. He also banned the Associated Press from the White House press pool after the news agency refused to refer to the Gulf of Mexico, as it is still known internationally, by Trump's new moniker, the Gulf of America.Meanwhile, in April, the White House began holding press briefings for MAGA influencers, whom they called the \"new media.\" That included YouTubers Jake and Logan Paul and mixed martial artist Conor McGregor, who have primarily young male audiences.In June, Trump appeared on Logan Paul's podcast, Impaulsive, where the two discussed a wide range of topics, including aliens and artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Jake Paul contributed $10,000 to the Trump Save America Joint Fundraising Committee.Shauna Daly, a cofounder of the liberal YMRI, explained the significance of appealing to young male voters.\"In order to win, he needs to change the electorate,\" she told NPR. \"And young men historically are less likely to vote, but if he can turn them out, if he can get them to vote, that could change the electorate enough to give him a margin of victory.\"But Deckman doubts that Trump's popularity among young voters will last, particularly amid such a volatile economy.\"I suspect that once companies such as Walmart increase prices as a reaction to the tariffs, Trump's favorability will drop with many groups, including younger Americans,\" she said.","summary":"More than 100 days into Trump's second term, a surprising trend is emerging: growing support from young Americans.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-approval-ratings-young-americans-2075210","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2648818/donald-trump-winning-back-young-voters.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-26 08:00:01","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.115},{"id":324874594,"title":"Hoo Boy: Democrats’ Latest Attempt to Understand Their Losses Is Comically Out of Touch","text":"Democrats have been in the wilderness since they lost in November. \n\nBut what they’re trying to do to figure it out shows just how lost they are. \n\nCheck out this New York Times report:\n\nThe Times has acquired a prospectus for a new $20 million initiative focused on rebuilding Democratic support among young men, particularly online.

The incident, which occurred at the Shanksville Fire Station in Pennsylvania in September 2024, quickly went viral after Biden was seen placing a Trump supporter's \"Trump 2024\" campaign hat on top of his own. The White House initially described the act as a friendly gesture of unity. But according to Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's book, named \"Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again\", Harris was stunned by the stunt. \"What is he doing?\" Harris reportedly asked her team upon seeing the video. \"This is completely unhelpful. And so unnecessary.\" The book notes that this marked the last time Harris appeared at a public event alongside Biden before the election. The authors add, \"But it was not the last time that Biden did something unhelpful,\" highlighting further missteps from the former president during the campaign. One such incident involved Biden harshly criticising Trump supporters during a campaign call on behalf of Harris. Biden called Trump supporters \"garbage\" and condemned their alleged demonisation of the Latino community, referencing a comment from a Trump rally speaker who described Puerto Rico as a \"floating island of garbage.\" Harris publicly distanced herself from Biden’s remarks, emphasising her commitment to representing all voters regardless of political affiliation. \"I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,\" she said. \"I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people, whether they support me or not.\" The book also reveals that several of Biden's 2024 campaign videos were scrapped due to poor performance. In one notable example, a planned town hall-style video shoot in a high school gym was abandoned after Biden struggled to respond effectively to scripted questions. Though some blamed technical issues like poor lighting, the book suggests Biden's difficulties were the primary problem.","summary":"A new book reveals tensions within the 2024 Democratic campaign, sparked by ex-President Biden's controversial decision to wear a 'Trump 2024' hat.

There are two possibilities here. One is that there is no rhyme or reason to Trump’s actions. He is simply a randomizing generator of chaos; the other is that there is a method. Appadurai subscribes to the second: Trump – and his advisers – know what they are doing.\n\nWhat else happened today:\n\nIt’s been five years since George Floyd was killed by police officer Derek Chauvin.

They like to pillory her as ignorant and irresponsible.\"Voss continued: \"At the same time, many Democrats embrace AOC as a worthy young successor to Bernie, someone who can play the role of progressive challenger in a Democratic nomination battle. Likely AOC tops the charts because she attracts so much bipartisan attention. Ocasio-Cortez enjoys good branding, as symbolized by the fact both supporters and critics simply refer to her as AOC. No matter what Ocasio-Cortez does in the next presidential election, she'll be hard to ignore.\"Notably, no politician has managed to seize the mantle as symbol of the mainstream Democratic Party, judging from this poll.

Plus, Trump’s FAA chaos spooks voters","text":"Survey Says is a weekly column rounding up three of the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about. You’ll also find data-based updates on past Daily Kos reporting, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\nHow Trump beat Harris\n\nA major new report provides fresh insights into the 2024 presidential electorate that enabled Donald Trump to defeat Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. \n\nAfter every even-year election, the Democratic data firm Catalist releases an in-depth analysis of the electorate—integrating voter files, census data, polling, and modeling—to better understand who turned out, who changed their votes, and where they shifted.\n\nIn its latest report, Catalist finds that Harris lost about 2 percentage points of support compared with Joe Biden in the 2020 election. And for the first time in the firm’s data, less than 50% of new voters—a group that typically is younger and more diverse—supported the Democratic nominee.\n\nHere’s how that played out on the ground.\n\nThe 2024 electorate was 3 points less white than it was in 2012, and voters ages 18 to 29 accounted for 15% of the 2024 electorate, 1 point less than in 2020. However, those younger voters also didn’t assist Democrats the way they once did, because that coalition is now more receptive to Republicans.\n\nMen of color, for example, swung hard toward Trump. Harris underperformed Biden by 6 points among men overall, but the decline was even sharper among Latino men (-12) and Black men (-8). While women provided Harris with similar margins compared with Biden, she lost ground with Asian women (-3) and young Latino voters (-12). Meanwhile, Harris failed to improve on Biden’s national numbers with Black women, a critical Democratic bloc.\n\nThe 2024 electorate also had a greater share of habitual voters than in either of the previous two presidential elections. And while less frequent voters comprised a smaller share of the electorate last year, they broke for Trump, with Harris underperforming Biden among those who had voted in just one to three of the past four elections (2022, 2020, 2018, and 2016).\n\nAll of these issues—and more—are why we find ourselves embroiled in Trump’s chaos yet again.\n\nFAA chaos fuels public fears\n\nFlying gets a bad rap these days—and honestly, it’s not hard to see why. \n\nSince January’s deadly crash near Washington, D.C., the Trump administration has dodged accountability for aviation issues, and while it may be trying to staff up on air traffic controllers, the Federal Aviation Administration is also shedding staff.\n\nThe result is a growing sense among voters that flying isn’t safe anymore. According to the latest Civiqs poll for Daily Kos, 71% of registered voters believe air travel is less safe now than it was five years ago. That includes a striking 85% of Democrats and 55% of Republicans, suggesting this is a rare area of bipartisan unease.\n\nAnd while voters may feel flying is riskier now, they’re not aligned on who to blame. When asked who’s more responsible for recent issues regarding air traffic control, 35% blame the former Biden administration, while a slightly larger group (39%) blame the Trump administration. Unsurprisingly, there is a partisan split: Democrats are more likely to point a finger at Trump, while Republicans pile on Biden.\n\nBut here’s the thing: In most regards, flying is about as safe as it’s ever been, at least so far.\n\nDespite high-profile crashes, the number of monthly accidents in the U.S. among private and commercial airline flights is in line with recent norms, according to data from the National Transportation Safety Board. For instance, the data for last month is preliminary, but if it holds, it would be the second-safest April since 2000. And the safest April came in 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when there were far fewer flights than usual.\n\nWhat’s driving the misperception of the safety of air travel? Media coverage might be a big part of it. (We at Daily Kos have covered our fair share of flying fiascos.) And the sheer visibility of accidents makes them feel more common than they are. \n\nBut that doesn’t let Trump off the hook. He’s done little to instill public confidence in air travel, repeatedly refusing to take responsibility for accidents. Meanwhile, behind closed doors, his close ally Elon Musk reportedly pushed to fire air traffic controllers amid what was already a shortage—because who needs oversight at 600 miles per hour?\n\nThe bottom line: The Trump administration seems determined to flirt with disaster at a time when voters are already scared.\n\nLosing the policy war\n\nTrump’s second term has been marked by a flurry of unpopular executive actions, but new data shows just how unpopular Trump’s agenda is.\n\nYouGov recently released public opinion data on 250 policies proposed, endorsed, or implemented by the Trump administration. The data is pulled from polls conducted since Trump took office, and they didn’t mention him or other political figures by name. The survey questions were stripped down and plain, with Americans asked “Would you support or oppose the following?” \n\nAnd the results are brutal for Trump\n\nIn averages across nearly every policy area, Trump is underwater. Immigration (-6), the economy (-8), education (-14), foreign policy (-25), and health care (-31)—all are net negative, meaning more people oppose them than support them on average. Only one policy area shows Trump with more average support than opposition: LGBTQ+ rights. There, 48% of Americans have backed his approach, while 38% have opposed it, on average.\n\nWhy the outlier? It’s likely because Trump’s LGBTQ+ policies are really about attacking transgender people. For instance, rather than loudly going after same-sex marriage, which a strong majority of Americans want to remain legal, Trump is targeting a vulnerable minority. And unfortunately, discomfort with transgender people remains widespread, even among Democrats. As grim as that is, it explains why a lot of voters support Trump here.\n\nBreaking down YouGov’s data by political party also reveals where Trump’s agenda plays—and where it flops. Take his executive order barring schools from using diversity, equity, and inclusion principles to evaluate discipline: Republicans love it (net +56 support), but independents (-4) and Democrats (-44) reject it, according to a poll YouGov conducted recently.\n\nOr his federal hiring freeze: Democrats hate it (net -44 support), and even independents are split, with a -12 net disapproval overall for this bloc, but Republicans still widely back it (+55). \n\nThat shows how Trump’s policies often provoke major backlash, even when they poll abovewater with his base.\n\nOverall, the numbers paint a clear picture: Most of Trump’s agenda just isn’t popular. \n\nAny updates?\n\n Congressional Republicans are pushing deep cuts to Medicaid, the health program that covers millions of low-income and disabled Americans, but Americans aren’t on board: Just 12% support cutting funding for or eliminating Medicaid, according to a new YouGov poll. Only 17% back cuts to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the federal food assistance program. A new Civiqs poll for Daily Kos backs this up: 67% of registered voters oppose reducing funding for Medicaid, while only 28% support it.\n\n Trump’s antics on social media are well documented—and widely reviled. According to YouGov, 42% of Americans have a negative view of content posted to Trump’s and the White House’s social media accounts, while only 27% view it positively. Unsurprisingly, Republicans are the most receptive. But when the White House is out here posting dystopian ASMR videos of immigrants getting deported, what kind of reaction do you expect?\n\nDemocrats don’t win points by playing nice with Republicans. Just ask California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nLately, Newsom has cozied up to some of the worst that the right has to offer. He invited infamous bigot Charlie Kirk onto his podcast, where the two agreed that Democrats went too far by being nice to transgender athletes. He has also criticized gender-inclusive language, questioning why Democrats use the term “Latinx.”\n\nBut chasing the middle doesn’t help. It just makes you appear weak and inauthentic. And voters agree. According to Civiqs, 54% of registered voters have an unfavorable view of Newsom, up from 51% right before the Kirk interview. And his “favorable” number plummeted from 32% to just 26%.\n\nDemocrats are the most unforgiving. Only 53% of them now view him favorably, down from 67% before the Kirk interview. \n\nNewsom may have his eyes on the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, but if this is his strategy, he’s already off track. While he’s busy chasing voters who will never support him, he’s losing the ones who might have.\n\nAndrew Mangan contributed research.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly column rounding up three of the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about.

Chauvin was found guilty on all charges in the case and sentenced to more than 20 years in prison; three other officers who were also on the scene and failed to get Floyd help as he struggled to breathe were found guilty of federal civil rights violations and sentenced from 30 to 42 months in prison. But a new report from the New York Times, coupled with recent actions from the Trump administration, suggests that whatever progress appeared to come in the wake of Floyd’s murder was not lasting.\n\nA New York Times analysis published Saturday, based on data from the Washington Post and the database Mapping Police Violence, found that the number of police killings nationwide has risen every year since 2020—with Black people constituting a disproportionate number of the victims. Last year, for example, there were a total of 1,226 people killed by police, an 18 percent increase from 2019, the Times found. While most of the victims killed by police reportedly were armed, some, like Floyd, were not. Last year, 53 unarmed people were killed by police, compared to 95 in 2020, according to the Times analysis. Over the past decade, Black people have been killed by police at more than two times the rate of white people. (Native Americans were the racial group with the highest rate of police killings, according to the Times data.)\n\nThe rates of police killings were higher—and have increased since 2020—in the redder states that President Donald Trump won in the last election; the bluer states that former Vice President Kamala Harris won, on the other hand, saw stabilized rates of police killings since 2020.\n\nThe actions of the Trump administration do not inspire confidence that those numbers will decrease anytime soon. This week, the Department of Justice announced it was dismissing lawsuits and consent decrees against police departments in Minneapolis, where Floyd was murdered, and in Louisville, Kentucky, where police killed Breonna Taylor in March 2020. (Officials in Minneapolis and Louisville said they would continue working to implement police reforms.) The DOJ also announced it was ending Biden-era investigations into a half dozen other police departments that the prior administration accused of constitutional violations. Civil rights groups said those moves would likely worsen police violence; the ACLU said Trump’s DOJ was sending “a message that the government is willing to look away from harm being inflicted on our communities—even when the harm is plain as day.”\n\nThose shifts come as the Trump administration has also prioritized the abolishment of diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, or DEI, across the federal government and beyond.\n\nThe current political climate may help explain why more than 70 percent of adults recently surveyed by the Pew Research Center said they do not believe the increased focus on race following Floyd’s murder made Black Americans’ lives better. And the amount of Americans who say they support the Black Lives Matter movement has dropped 15 points since 2020, though a majority—52 percent—still say they are in favor of it, according to Pew.\n\nOn Sunday, various Democratic lawmakers commemorated Floyd’s passing on social media, including Minnesotans Gov. Tim Walz and Rep. Ilhan Omar, along with Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Rep. Monica McIver (D-N.J.), Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas), and Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.). Crockett, Omar, and McIver called on Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a bill first introduced in 2021 that would increase accountability for law enforcement. Its measures include creating a national registry to track police misconduct, limiting no-knock warrants and chokeholds, and requiring training on implicit bias and racial profiling for law enforcement officers. The bill was most recently reintroduced in the House last year by Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-Texas), but it failed to get a vote.\n\nMother Jones video correspondent Garrison Hayes sees reasons for hope, despite the limits to the progress of the past five years:\n\nIf 2020 was The Awakening, and the last four years have been The Retrenchment, then 2025 may mark the beginning of a new phase: The Reevaluation.\n\nI think the 2020 BLM protests were about bolstering Black social and political power, and despite all of the attacks that effort has endured, Black people aren’t giving up on it any time soon.\n\nIn Louisiana, Black voters helped defeat a constitutional amendment that would have made it easier to try children as adults — a move that many viewed as a veiled attempt to deepen mass incarceration.\n\nWe’re seeing it in economic protest too, with Black consumers leading boycotts of major corporations like Target, disrupting profit margins and forcing boardroom conversations.\n\nAnd we’re seeing it in grassroots organizing. Activists like Angela Rye and journalist Joy Reid are crisscrossing the country on the State of the People Power Tour, mobilizing and educating Black communities on how to build lasting political power from the ground up.\n\nSo, five years later, when we ask what’s changed, maybe the most honest answer is that we changed; and that might be the most powerful change of all.","summary":"Five years ago today, George Floyd, a 46-year-old unarmed Black man, was murdered by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, in Minneapolis.

At the kick-off show of his newly rechristened Land of Hope and Dreams Tour with the E Street Band, Springsteen framed his criticism of Donald Trump in patriotism: “The America that I’ve sung to you about for 50 years is real, and regardless of its faults, is a great country with a great people. And we will survive this moment.” \n\n As discussed in the latest episode of Rolling Stone Music Now, Springsteen’s multiple onstage speeches, punctuated with on-message songs (“Land of Hope and Dreams,” Bob Dylan’s “Chimes of Freedom”) were arguably a masterclass in opposition messaging. His insistence on the existence of another, better version of the country should be instructive to many floundering Democrats — especially considering the extent to which his words captured Donald Trump’s attention. To hear the whole episode, which breaks down the Trump/Springsteen war of words and much more, go here for the podcast provider of your choice, listen on Apple Podcasts or Spotify, or just press play above. \n\n Two days after Springsteen’s remarks, Trump took to Truth Social to call his critic a “dried out prune of a rocker” whose “skin is all atrophied” and warned him to “KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country,” with the ominous addendum, “then we’ll all see how it goes for him!” The threats escalated at 1:34 a.m. May 19, the night before his scheduled call with Vladimir Putin about Ukraine, “HOW MUCH DID KAMALA HARRIS PAY BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN FOR HIS POOR PERFORMANCE DURING HER CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT?” he wrote. “I am going to call for a major investigation into this matter.” \n\n Trump also demanded investigations into Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Oprah Winfrey, and somehow even Bono — who, as Rolling Stone‘s Andy Greene points out in the new episode, “played no role in the election whatsoever.” As discussed in the episode, Trump had it backwards: campaigns are actually required to pay fair market value for production costs to avoid undisclosed contributions. (When Rolling Stone asked the White House about the baseless threats this week, a spokesperson shot back, “accountability for a class of people who act as if they’re above the law may be uncomfortable for Rolling Stone, but it’s refreshing to the American people.”)\n\n Of course, it wasn’t just Springsteen’s eloquent framing of his opposition that irritated Trump — as his inclusion of Swift, Beyoncé, and Winfrey in his threats suggests, he is a creature of fame and showbiz who is exquisitely sensitive to the power of celebrity. He’s won two elections, but still faces the irksome reality that pop culture is far from still fully MAGA-fied.\n\n The episode also ponders why musicians have been relatively quiet about the Trump Administration since January, suggesting a combination of an atmosphere of fear, a sense that 2017-style Resistance messaging failed, and the fact that it’s still more socially acceptable for younger acts to criticize Democrats from the left than to mention Trump. Still, artists including Neil Young and Eddie Vedder have offered support for Springsteen’s remarks, and MJ Lenderman covered “Darkness on the Edge of Town” in an apparent show of solidarity.\n\n Download and subscribe to Rolling Stone‘s weekly podcast, Rolling Stone Music Now, hosted by Brian Hiatt, on Apple Podcasts or Spotify (or wherever you get your podcasts).

More Donald Trump arrives to speak during an election night event at the Palm Beach Convention Center on November 06, 2024 in West Palm Beach, Florida. Americans cast their ballots today in the presidential race between Republican nominee former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as multiple state elections that will determine the balance of power in Congress. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nRepublicans in the House of Representatives passed the GOP “One, Big Beautiful” budget bill which included a provision for Trump Accounts.\n\nPreviously called “MAGA Accounts Contribution Pilot Program,” in which MAGA stood for Money Account for Growth and Advancement, this provision is similar to the $5,000 Baby Bond suggested by Senator Hillary Clinton when she was running for President.\n\nWhat is a Trump Account?\n\nThe Trump Account is a tax-deferred investment account that the Treasury Department would set up automatically for each eligible child born in 2025 through 2028. They call it a savings account but it will act more like a brokerage account.\n\nThe child must be a U.S. citizen at birth, have a Social Security Number, and be born to parents who both have Social Security Numbers.\n\nParents can also contribute up to $5,000 per year into this account for their children.\n\nThe assets in a Trump Account would grow tax free but would be taxed at long term capital gains rates when withdrawn if they are used for qualifying expenses. Qualifying expenses include education, first time home, and even capital for starting a business.\n\nHalf of the funds can be withdrawn once the child turns 18. If the funds are not used for a qualifying expense, it would be taxed as income. After 30, all the funds can be withdrawn for any purpose.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nChange Your PIN Code Now If It’s On This List\n\nApple Makes New Offer To iPhone 16 Buyers\n\nGoogle’s Gmail Upgrade—Why You Need This New Email Address\n\nHow Does This Compare with a 529 Plan?\n\nIt’s natural to compare this with another tax advantaged account often used for education. 529 Plans are, in many ways, far superior though it does lack one beneficial feature of the Trump Account - the Treasury sending a child $1,000 just for being born.\n\nIf you use 529 funds for qualified educational expenses, you pay no tax. While long term capital gains rates are quite favorable, they’re not nearly as favorable as zero percent.\n\n529 Plans also have the nice new feature in which you can transfer funds into a Roth IRA subject to certain limits and conditions. This means that if you contribute too much to a 529 plan, there’s a buffer amount you can always transfer into a Roth IRA. The lifetime limit of transfers is $35,000 - which is quite significant.\n\nTrump Accounts do include buying a first home and starting a business as qualified expenses, but you are still subject to long term capital gains tax.\n\nTrump Accounts Are Not Yet Law\n\nThe House of Representatives has passed a version of the bill but the Senate has yet to take it up. We will see whether the Senate version keeps the Trump Accounts as is or if they will make adjustments.\n\nIf it remains unchanged, you might as well take the free $1,000 that comes with automatic enrollment of a Trump Account but there’s little reason to contribute more towards the account as the child ages. For education expenses, you’re better off contributing into a 529 plan.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"The GOP bill passed by the House of Representatives includes a $1,000 Trump Account for every eligible baby born in the United States - is this a good idea?","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimwang/2025/05/25/are-1000-trump-accounts-a-good-idea/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68335590efc2cdb7700bb1d0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 17:41:29","author":"Chip Somodevilla,Contributor,Jim Wang","authors":["Chip Somodevilla","Contributor","Jim Wang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.008},{"id":325113402,"title":"Democrats find unlikely defender over Biden decline revelations – Trump’s former press secretary","text":"Kayleigh McEnany, President Donald Trump’s former press secretary, has surprisingly admitted that she thinks many Democrats are “exonerated” by new revelations about President Joe Biden’s decline while in office.\n\nMcEnany, 37, was Trump’s spokesperson from April 2020 to January 2021. She made the remarks Friday night while discussing Original Sin, a new book about Biden’s decline by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’s Alex Thompson. In the exposé, Tapper and Thompson claim that only a small group of aides had regular access to Biden and the First Lady.\n\n“Six or seven? That was the number that had the close-up access? And I say this because in some ways, I think it’s exonerating of much of the Democratic Party,” McEnany said Friday night on Fox News’s Jesse Watters Primetime.\n\nMcEnany said it’s common for only an exclusive group of people to have access to the president.\n\n“I worked at the RNC, didn't have much access to President Trump,” she said. “Worked on the campaign. Didn't have much access to President Trump at the time. It really was a small cadre in the West Wing.”\n\nThe book, which hit the shelves this week just days after Biden revealed his cancer diagnosis, details the then-president’s failed reelection bid and the alleged cover-up of his decline, physically and mentally. The book made several shocking claims, including that Biden’s aides wanted to put him in a wheelchair.\n\n“Biden's physical deterioration — most apparent in his halting walk — had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election,” Tapper and Thompson wrote.\n\nTapper and Thompson also detailed an alleged interaction between Biden and George Clooney, in which the president failed to recognize the A-list actor.\n\n“It was like watching someone who was not alive,” an unnamed “Hollywood VIP” who witnessed the interaction told the authors. “It was startling. And we all looked at each other. It was so awful.”\n\nThe book also covers Biden’s decision to drop out, and the subsequent reaction from Democrats. David Plouffe, who worked on Kamala Harris's campaign, told Tapper and Thompson that Biden “totally f***ed us” by not stepping down sooner.\n\nPlouffe characterized the campaign as “a f***ing nightmare,” which he said was “all Biden.”\n\nIn response to the book’s release, Biden spokesperson Chris Meagher previously said his team is “still waiting for someone, anyone, to point out where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or make a presidential address where he was unable to do his job because of mental decline.”\n\n“In fact, the evidence points to the opposite — he was a very effective president,” he said.","summary":"Kayleigh McEnany served as Donald Trump’s press secretary during the final months of his first term","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-kayleigh-mcenany-biden-decline-book-b2758016.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/09/24/09/newFile-5.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/AIz4Ifte-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-25 16:08:00","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.471},{"id":324747556,"title":"Even conservatives should be alarmed about Trump attacking Springsteen | Friendly Fire","text":"Julie Roginsky, a Democrat, and Mike DuHaime, a Republican, are consultants who have worked on opposite teams for their entire careers yet have remained friends. Here, they discuss the week’s political events with Star-Ledger editor Enrique Lavín.\n\nQ: President Trump‘s “Big, Beautiful Bill” — to extend tax cuts for the rich and slash Americans’ social safety net — passed by a single vote in the House. How do you see it playing out in the Senate? \n\nJulie: The Senate will eventually fall in line after Trump threatens a few senators with primaries. I expect them to tinker with it a little, which means the House will have to vote on the senate’s version and go through this again, but to be clear: tens of millions of Americans will lose their healthcare, tens of millions of Americans will go hungry and tens of millions of Americans will be paying more while Trump, Elon Musk and their billionaire friends get a huge tax break. Is this what you voted for, America?\n\nMike: These are the same Democratic talking points that get used every time there is a tax cut. Yet, somehow, America moves forward without mass carnage in the streets. The problem with the Democratic and media messaging is that maybe it will be true this time. But all the terrible things that Democrats said about George W. Bush and John McCain and Mitt Romney weren’t true. So, now no one believes your same talking points anymore. The Democratic Party is the boy who cried wolf, and now the wolf is really here, and no one believes you.\n\nJulie: You don’t have to believe me and you can feel good about owning the libs — until people lose their healthcare, state budgets go bankrupt because they have to pick up the slack and tens of millions of people lose access to food. The proof will be in the mass suffering this will cause for the constituents of the very people who voted for this legislation. \n\nMike: My point is the libs have owned themselves. They have brought all this on themselves by running bad candidates, having the same comms issues over and over again, and simply losing repeatedly to someone who is doing exactly what he said he would do, whether you or I like it or not. \n\nQ: Any other aspects of this Trump victory to watch for?\n\nJulie: The only thing to note is that the legislative branch has abdicated its constitutional duty to act as a check on the executive – again. \n\nMike: That’s a bit of an overstatement. The bill changed several times to win the votes of many of the holdout GOP members. If Democrats had won the House, they would be the ones getting concessions from the White House. But Democrats lost because of their own incompetence. And elections have consequences. \n\nJulie: They sure do — which is why Republicans are in for a bloodbath in 2026 if we actually have free and fair elections. \n\nMike: Please don’t pull a Trump and start sowing doubt in elections. The elections were fair when Trump won in 2016, when he lost in 2020, and when he won in 2024. Elections are decentralized and run by counties all over the country. The election workers deserve our trust, not more skepticism from both sides.\n\nQ: A New York Times analysis shows the Republican administration has cut research grants in half (80% to STEM education). These cuts affect nearly all scientific fields, which economists say will result in a major recession. Help us make sense of this.\n\nJulie: This is what authoritarians do. They come for academia. Then they come for the press. Then they come for the people. This is the same playbook and we are running out of time to stop it. \n\nMike: These cuts are not in the long-term interest of the U.S. The problem is these programs have yet to find a political constituency outside of academia who will fight for them in Washington. They need that. \n\nQ: Considering he pardoned the January 6 mob that attacked and injured U.S. Capitol police, what are the chances President Trump pardons New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver if she’s convicted for allegedly “shoving” ICE agents, as he put it?\n\nJulie: You’re funny. LaMonica McIver is a Black woman who votes against Trump. If she were a white woman who stormed the Capitol, she would be getting an official apology and maybe a settlement at taxpayer expense. To be clear: Rep. McIver did absolutely nothing wrong. If she had, ICE would not have escorted her for a tour of Delaney Hall after this alleged incident. This whole thing is a political setup and it’s offensive to anyone who actually remembers when the U.S. Attorney’s office was not a prop for cable news fodder.\n\nMike: Several things can be true at the same time. Rep. McIver should not have physically interfered with U.S. law enforcement agents. It is not OK for anyone to put their hands on police officers. That said, all the MAGA folks who were excusing January 6th rioters beating cops with flagpoles and spraying them with bear spray should withhold any comparison with that riot to this minor shoving match. I am hopeful charges will be dropped, and cooler heads will prevail. McIver had every right to be there and inspect the facility, so I hope the DOJ will drop any charges in the name of consistency. But we should not tolerate anyone getting physical with police; it is not justified simply because you disagree with the administration’s policies. \n\nJulie: I see no evidence that McIver “put her hands” on anyone. I see her being pushed and shoved and trying to defend herself. \n\nQ: Speaking of trying to jail his opponents: Trump says he’s launching an investigation into American cultural institutions Bruce Springsteen, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift and Oprah Winfrey for campaign finance violations after they endorsed Kamala Harris. What ramifications do you see? \n\nJulie: The bottom line is that this is a direct assault on the First Amendment and yet the most powerful people in entertainment – the ones who can reach billions of people around the world – are not getting together to say so plainly. At the risk of dating myself, we need a Live Aid for the First Amendment. Where’s Bob Geldof to organize it? (I wrote a whole article about this, which you can read here.)\n\nMIke: Conservatives should not be OK with legal intimidation and cost done purposely to infringe on one’s First Amendment rights. If Kid Rock and Ted Nugent actually influenced any voters, they could be next! While I don’t often agree with entertainers and athletes as they take political stands, I respect that they use their platforms to try to make social change. They are taking personal and commercial risk to make their points, and their First Amendment rights should be protected. \n\nQ: In the final Republican debate before the June 10 primary, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, who is polling in low single digits, contended Democrats are afraid of him the most because he would be the toughest to beat. Any truth to that?\n\nJulie: Bramnick definitely has crossover appeal and yes, he would likely be the strongest candidate in November – assuming the Republican base came out for him, which is a big assumption. \n\nMike: One of Bill Spadea’s top supporters even said Jon Bramnick would be the strongest general election candidate. Bramnick wins repeatedly in a district Trump lost by 12% a year ago. Bramnick consistently gets votes from Republicans, independents and Democrats. But Jack Ciattarelli has Trump’s endorsement, which is something primary voters care more about than one’s track record of winning tough races. \n\nQ: Similarly, some Republicans hope Newark Mayor Ras Baraka is the Democratic nominee because they see him as easier to defeat in November than a moderate candidate, like Mikie Sherrill, the apparent frontrunner. \n\nJulie: I don’t agree with that. Baraka has the ability to inspire low-propensity voters, the kind who stayed home last November. Each of the Democratic nominees has a base that is unique to them, which they can turn out. The question is whether the eventual nominee can unify the party enough to get them all to work for him or her after June 10. \n\nMike: Be careful picking your opponent. Any candidate who wins a primary with six legitimate candidates in the field, will be battle-tested with a proven ability to win a tough race. Mayor Baraka has impressed many since day one of his race. Be careful thinking anyone in this field would be easy to beat in the state with nearly a million more Democrats than Republicans. This will be a close race to the finish. \n\nQuick thoughts on:\n\nDonald Trump Jr. said at an economic forum his father has transformed the Republican Party into the America First Party or the MAGA Party. \n\nJulie: Where’s the lie? Rational Republicans like my friend Mike here have been pushed out of a party that is now a Trump cult. \n\nMike: No disagreement here. Trump has taken over the party.\n\nAt the same forum in Qatar, Trump junior was asked if he’d run for president in 2028. Recent polling shows JD Vance as heir apparent with Marco Rubio finding marginal support.\n\nJulie: I’m not sure that Donald Trump’s magic is transferable to anyone else. I also don’t believe we will have a free and fair election in 2028. \n\nMike: Julie’s right, though Americans like political brands, as do New Jerseyans — the Kennedys, the Bushes, the Clintons, the Keans. But Junior acts like a spoiled rich kid as opposed to the others who approach public service out of a sense of obligation.\n\nElon Musk has indicated he’s pulling away from the Trump admin to focus on Tesla. And yet, the South African native was singled out among the attendees by Trump during his bizarre meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. \n\nJulie: Musk is saying this because Tesla stock is in the toilet. The reality is that DOGE is his handiwork and that is still going. So is the ridiculous Afrikaner immigration policy and even Trump’s treatment of President Ramaphosa. Rate this as a blatant lie. \n\nMike: American politics is so fun. All the lefties hate the guy who did more for electric cars than anyone. And all the right-wingers come to the defense of the guy who enriches himself more from public subsidies than anyone in history. And it’s the same guy. America is great indeed. \n\nA note to readers: Can Americans still have a sensible and friendly political discussion across the partisan divide? The answer is yes, and we prove it every week with this “Friendly Fire” conversation. \n\nMike and Julie are deeply engaged in politics and commercial advocacy in New Jersey, so both have connections to many players discussed in this column. DuHaime, the founder of MAD Global Strategy, has worked for Chris Christie, Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, and George W. Bush. Roginsky, a principal of Comprehensive Communications Group and author of the Salty Politics column in Substack, has served as senior advisor to campaigns of Cory Booker, Frank Lautenberg, and Phil Murphy.\n\nLocal journalism needs your support.

In recent weeks, Redstone — who stands to profit from federal approval of the merger — has come under fire for advocating a settlement with Trump and keeping tabs on CBS coverage of the president, who claims the outlet deceptively edited an interview it conducted with Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nParamount’s leadership has reportedly discussed settling the Trump lawsuit for up to $20 million. Redstone has privately pushed for a settlement in hopes that it will “clear the way for the merger’s approval,” The Wall Street Journal reported last month.\n\n“I am writing to demand that you institute an immediate litigation hold, as FPF plans to file a shareholder derivative lawsuit on behalf of Paramount in the event of a settlement by Paramount,” wrote Seth Stern, FPF’s director of advocacy. “We expect that other long-term shareholders will join the suit.”\n\nFPF notes that a derivative lawsuit “is a procedure that allows shareholders of a company to recover damages incurred due to impropriety by executives and directors.”\n\n“Any damages award would go to Paramount, not FPF,” the group added.\n\nThe lawsuit warning comes after a trio of U.S. senators cautioned that Paramount “may be engaging in potentially illegal conduct” by pursuing a settlement with Trump in exchange for approval of the Skydance merger.\n\n“Paramount appears to be attempting to appease the administration in order to secure merger approval,” wrote Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) in a May 19 letter to Redstone.\n\nInternally, Paramount executives have acknowledged that settling the Trump suit “could expose directors and officers to liability in potential future shareholder litigation or criminal charges for bribing a public official,” the Journal reported in February.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Stern said that “corporations that own news outlets should not be in the business of settling baseless lawsuits that clearly violate the First Amendment and put other media outlets at risk.”\n\n“A settlement of Trump’s meritless lawsuit may well be a thinly veiled effort to launder bribes through the court system,” said Stern. “Not only would it tank CBS’s reputation but, as three U.S. senators recently explained, it could put Paramount executives at risk of breaking the law.”\n\n“Our mission as a press freedom organization is to defend the rights of journalists and the public, not the financial interests of corporate higher-ups who turn their backs on them. When you run a news organization, you have the responsibility to protect First Amendment rights, not abandon them to line your own pockets,” Stern added. “We hope Paramount will reconsider the dangerous path it appears to be contemplating but, if not, we are prepared to pursue our rights as shareholders. And we hope other Paramount shareholders will join us.”","summary":"The Freedom of the Press Foundation notified company executives that a settlement  &ldquo;could amount to a bribe.&rdquo;","url":"https://truthout.org/articles/press-freedom-group-threatens-to-sue-paramount-if-company-settles-with-trump/","image":"https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2211620640-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 14:02:40","author":"Jake Johnson","authors":["Jake Johnson"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.245},{"id":324720332,"title":"Kamala Harris Shreds Elon Musk for ‘Weakness’ Comments","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris put Elon Musk on blast for saying “empathy” has made America weak.\n\n“There was someone that is very popular these days, at least in the press, who suggested that it is a sign of weakness of Western civilizations to have empathy,” Harris told a real estate conference in Australia. \n\nIn March, Musk—the head of the government-slashing Department of Efficiency (DOGE)—spoke with MAGA influencer and conspiracy theorist Joe Rogan on his podcast. \n\n“The fundamental weakness of Western civilization is empathy, the empathy exploit,” Musk said, adding that “they’re exploiting a bug in Western civilization, which is the empathy response.”\n\nSlamming the DOGE chief for having “this misplaced idea that the sign of the strength of a leader is who you beat down,” she said she thinks it is, in fact, “a sign of strength to have some level of curiosity and concern and care about the well-being of others.”\n\nThough Harris did not refer to Musk by name, it was clear her comments were aimed at the Tesla CEO, who has stepped back from his duties at DOGE in recent weeks. \n\nDuring her Sunday conference appearance, Harris acknowledged the rise of fascism, telling the audience, “I do worry, frankly, about what’s happening in the world right now.”\n\n“It’s important that we remember the 1930s,” she said. “It’s important that we remember that history has taught us that isolation does not equal insulation [and] the importance of relationships of trust, of the importance of friendships, integrity, honesty.”\n\nThese comments also appear to have been in veiled reference to Musk, who has courted controversy since assuming his post as President Donald Trump‘s government efficiency czar with a raft of statements and gestures widely perceived as a dog whistle for white supremacists. \n\nPerhaps most famously, this included the Tesla chief giving what appeared to have been a “Roman salute” at a speaking event on the night of Trump’s inauguration, quickly followed by a slew of posts on X that featured a series of puns on the names of prominent Nazi figures.","summary":"Etienne Laurent/ReutersFormer Vice President Kamala Harris put Elon Musk on blast for saying “empathy” has made America weak.\n\n“There was someone that is very popular these days, at least in the press, who suggested that it is a sign of weakness of Western civilizations to have empathy,” Harris told a real estate conference in Australia. \n\nIn March, Musk—the head of the government-slashing Department of Efficiency (DOGE)—spoke with MAGA influencer and conspiracy theorist Joe Rogan on his podcast. \n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/kamala-harris-shreds-doge-chief-elon-musk-over-empathy-critique/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/ZCFXGAVFQVE2DJJ7WZ3OFUB5BI.JPG?smart=true&auth=6cc290104a10e9bcfdc505446658f67cb3a9337b147a25b7a28be1e69daf935e&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 13:09:35","author":"Will Neal","authors":["Will Neal"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":324698574,"title":"Beware Meghan Markle's kiss of death! Political insiders' intriguing warning to Kamala Harris as she prepares for comeback","text":"When former President Joe Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate in August 2020, congratulations winged their way from Montecito.\n\n'I'm so excited to see that kind of representation,' the Duchess of Sussex said in an interview from her Southern California garden. 'You know, for me, being biracial, growing up, whether it was a doll or a person in office, you need to see someone who looks like you in some capacity.'\n\nWeeks earlier, Harris had reposted a video of Meghan Markle urging young people to get out and vote, thanking the Duchess for her 'powerful statement.'\n\nAt the time, it seemed like the beginning of a long-term alliance between the two women, even sparking speculation that Meghan will eventually embark on a political career of her own (a suggestion she recently denied).\n\nBut fast forward five years and, as Harris reportedly considers running for Governor of California, there is silence from camp Sussex.\n\nAnd it may be in the former vice president's best interest, as it seems any public endorsement from Meghan may now be regarded as a political albatross.\n\n'It would reinforce the stereotype of Kamala Harris being an out-of-touch elitist who is more interested in royalty than the struggles of Californians,' one Golden State political insider told the Daily Mail.\n\nAnother said: 'In California, the wokest of states, there's an exhaustion with celebrity, and an exhaustion with wokeness.' \n\nHarris is reportedly mulling a gubernatorial run in 2026 to replace Gavin Newsom, who is coming to the end of his second term.\n\nDespite her November presidential election humiliation, some aides of Harris are said to believe her universal name recognition could yet still clear the field if she enters the race. After all, a recent Emerson College poll measuring favorability gave her a 23 percent lead over her nearest rival.\n\nThose loyal aides believe becoming governor of the most populous state, and the world's fourth-largest economy, would provide Harris a base from which to attack President Donald Trump.\n\nBut, if she does intend to run for yet another public office - the former VP also served as senator of California, attorney general for the state and district attorney of San Francisco - experts have warned her not to make the same missteps as her failed bid for president.\n\nJoining the race with just 107 days before the election, Harris garnered a parade of celebrity endorsements in 2024 from the likes of Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Bruce Springsteen and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nYet, the pomp and circumstance of her short-lived campaign was seemingly for naught - she lost the election with 226 electoral college votes to Trump's victorious 312.\n\nAnd on Monday, those high-profile endorsements became the subject of controversy.\n\nIt emerged that the Harris campaign paid $1 million to Winfrey's company Harpo Productions for 'event production,' and another $165,000 went to Beyoncé's production company after the star appeared on stage at a Harris rally in Houston, Texas.\n\nWhile both Winfrey and Beyoncé's mother Tina Knowles - who runs her daughter's production company - said they did not take any personal fees, Trump has called for an investigation, alleging that Harris paid for endorsements 'under the guise of paying for entertainment,' he claimed on Truth Social.\n\nA spokeswoman for Harris said at the time the money was for 'ancillary costs' relating to production.\n\nShe said: 'We do not pay. We have never paid any artist and performer. We have never paid a fee to that person. There are laws that have to be followed that we have followed religiously on this campaign.'\n\nAll of which has shed light on the waning power of celebrity endorsement - once considered the silver bullet of any political campaign.\n\n'Harris’s presidential campaign proved that voters are more concerned about how a candidate will govern rather than who they pay to say nice things about them,' Matt Shupe, spokesman for the California Republican Party, told the Daily Mail.\n\n'The vibe shift in California is real and Californians are ready for real change in the trajectory of our state.'\n\nAs for Meghan Markle's place in all this, Tab Berg - a Republican political strategist based in California - is among those saying loudly that Harris would be wise to avoid wheeling out the Duchess, one of the state's most famous residents, for any splashy future endorsement. \n\n'In general, celebrity endorsements are now a net negative,' he said. 'It's not a working formula. There's a tiny number of voters that look for what celebrities say.'\n\nHe added, 'I don't think any of the serious players [in California] would take [Meghan] seriously.'\n\nIn fact, backing from Meghan could hurt Harris, Berg claimed, while an endorsement from Prince Harry would have 'zero' impact on her chances of victory. \n\nMeghan's approval rating in the UK hit a record low of 20 percent according to a recent poll, while in the US, she sits higher at 41 percent approval.\n\n'If Kamala runs I'm 100 percent sure she would hop on a Meghan Markle endorsement,' Berg alleged. 'But my advice would be to downplay it, don't do a public event, use it to raise money. Voters have no interest. It's a net negative.","summary":"When former President Joe Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate in August 2020, congratulations winged their way from Montecito.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14736945/Meghan-Markle-Kamala-Harris-warning.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/23/19/96723313-0-Sources_have_also_revealed_that_Harry_is_lonelier_than_ever_in_M-a-25_1748025761178.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 11:59:46","author":"Editor,Nick Allen","authors":["Editor","Nick Allen"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.084},{"id":324705478,"title":"Original Sin: how Team Biden wished away his decline until it was too late","text":"Joe Biden mistook his victory in 2020 for a sweeping, FDR-like mandate. Officially, that was before age and decay caught up. Horrifically, for Democrats, in June 2024 a debacle of a debate against Donald Trump confirmed what Washington insiders had only dared whisper but what most voters had known: Biden should not have sought re-election.\n\nLess than a month later, he was out, replaced as Democratic nominee by his vice-president, Kamala Harris. Now, Trump runs wild and Biden’s legacy is buried beneath a heap of unkind reporting – and bouquets of sympathy, after news of his cancer.\n\n“It was an abomination,” one prominent Democratic strategist is quoted as saying by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson. “He stole an election from the Democratic party; he stole it from the American people.”\n\nTapper and Thompson concur. Over 350 engrossing pages, they deliver a stinging judgment, trenchantly written and well-sourced.\n\nThe two reporters spoke to about 200 people, including members of Congress, White House staffers and campaign insiders. Some reportedly sounded the alarm about Biden’s mental acuity and desperate efforts by aides to hide his deterioration. The alarm was not heeded.\n\nTapper is CNN’s lead DC anchor and chief Washington correspondent. Thompson is a national political correspondent for Axios and a CNN contributor. His speech at the recent White House Correspondents’ Association dinner was one for the ages.\n\n“President Biden’s decline and its cover-up by the people around him is a reminder that every White House, regardless of party, is capable of deception,” Thompson said. “We, myself included, missed a lot of this story. And some people trust us less because of it. We bear some responsibility for faith in the media being at such lows.”\n\nOriginal Sin begins with a bang. Its first chapter is titled “He Fucked Us”, from an on-record quote by David Plouffe, senior adviser to the Harris campaign, before that manager of Barack Obama’s 2008 winning effort. “We got so screwed by Biden as a party,” Plouffe says. Harris was a “great soldier”, but the race was “a fucking nightmare. …\n\n“And it’s all Biden … He totally fucked us.” Try putting that toothpaste back in the tube. On the other hand, Plouffe doesn’t reveal what Harris knew about Biden’s fitness and when she knew it.\n\nBiden loyalists return the favor, too, the authors write: “Many … felt that Harris didn’t put in the work and was also just not a very nice person. Some quietly expressed buyer’s remorse: They should have picked [Gretchen] Whitmer,” the Democratic governor of Michigan.\n\nTapper and Thompson report cold political facts. In 2020, identity politics played an outsize role in Biden’s VP pick. “It boils down to whether he has a Hispanic woman or a Black woman,” Harry Reid, the former Senate Democratic leader, said then.\n\nTapper and Thompson lay bare a sense of betrayal.\n\n“The presidency requires someone who can perform at 2am during an emergency,” they write. “Cabinet secretaries in [Biden’s] own administration told us that by 2024, he could not be relied upon for this.”\n\nYet, Biden and his minions made sure to clear the field. The representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota, Biden’s only challenger among elected officials, never had a prayer. Governors stayed on the sidelines.\n\nTapper and Thompson tell us one senior White House aide left because he or she didn’t think Biden should run again. Biden had been walled off from staff to shield his decline.\n\n“I love Joe Biden,” the unnamed aide continues. “When it comes to decency, there are few in politics like him. Still, it was a disservice to the country and to the party for his family and advisers to allow him to run again.”\n\nThat ranks as an understatement. The cover of Original Sin shows Biden with hands covering his eyes. The former president, his family and his closest advisers – known as the “politburo” here – dwelt in a world of alternative facts.\n\n“The Bidens’ greatest strength is living in their own reality,” a source tells Tapper and Thompson. “And Biden himself is gifted at creating it: Beau isn’t going to die. Hunter’s sobriety is stable … Joe always tells the truth. Joe cares more about his family than his own ambition … They stick to the narrative and repeat it.”\n\nTo quote Lewis Carroll: “I have said it thrice: What I tell you three times is true.”\n\nBiden’s decline was not sudden, according to Tapper and Thompson. The signs were there years ago: “During an eight-day, grueling bus tour in Iowa in December 2019, Biden gave his aides pause. While doing prep, he struggled to remember the name of longtime aide Mike Donilon. ‘You know, you know,’ he said, groping for it.”\n\nDonilon had worked with Biden for nearly 40 years. It should have been time to start worrying. Cover-up and denial are foundational to the Biden saga.\n\nThis week brought Biden’s bad diagnosis.\n\n“He did not develop [metastatic prostate cancer] in the last 100, 200 days,” Zeke Emanuel, a doctor, told MSNBC on Monday. “He had it while he was president. He probably had it at the start of his presidency, in 2021 … I don’t think there’s any disagreement about that.”\n\nEmanuel’s brother, Rahm, was Biden’s ambassador to Japan, and before that chief of staff to Obama.\n\nDemocrats must address such self-inflicted wounds. Disapproval of Trump may be all they need to retake the House next year. But reckoning and redirection will be needed to recapture the White House. The party’s brand circles the drain.\n\nFor now, Trump is the exception that proves the rule: America is no country for old presidents.\n\n Original Sin is published in the US by Penguin Random House","summary":"Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson issue a stinging verdict on a cover-up that may have cost Democrats the 2024 election\n\nJoe Biden mistook his victory in 2020 for a sweeping, FDR-like mandate.

On Tuesday it bubbled up in the California governor’s race, when one candidate, Antonio Villaraigosa, a former mayor of Los Angeles, accused two other Democrats eyeing the governor’s mansion — former Vice President Kamala Harris and former Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra — of participating in a “cover-up” of Mr. Biden’s fading fitness in office.\n\n“Voters deserve to know the truth. What did Kamala Harris and Xavier Becerra know, when did they know it, and most importantly, why didn’t either of them speak out?” Mr. Villaraigosa fumed in a statement, spurred by tidbits from the new book “Original Sin,” which chronicles the efforts of Mr. Biden’s inner circle to conceal his mental and physical decline. Mr. Villaraigosa called on Ms. Harris and Mr. Becerra to “apologize to the American people.”\n\nIs Mr. Villaraigosa, who is 72 himself, exploiting the orgy of Biden recriminations for political ends? Probably. Does he have a point? Absolutely. Team Biden deserves much abuse for its sins. That said, last week also reminded us that the Democrats’ flirtation with gerontocracy is not confined to a single office or branch of government when, on Wednesday, the House was shaken by the death of Representative Gerry Connolly.\n\nMr. Connolly, a 75-year-old lawmaker from Northern Virginia, had been in poor health. On Nov. 7 last year, two days after his re-election to a ninth term, he announced he had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer and would undergo treatments. Even so, in December he won a high-profile contest against Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to be the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee. The race was seen as a struggle over the future of the seniority system that has long shaped how Democrats pick committee leaders. Despite concerns about his health, seniority carried the day. On April 28, he announced that his cancer had returned and that he would not seek re-election next year.

Also alarmed) when they saw Biden’s deterioration at his June 27, 2024, debate with Donald Trump?\n\nThe president’s halting speech and gait were obvious long before, to anyone with eyes to see – but dismissed as a congenital stutter and getting older by Biden sycophants who then attacked anyone who mentioned it as “ageist” and other insults. \n\nTapper himself had excoriated Lara Trump in a 2020 interview for mocking Biden’s “stutter” when she tried to address the cognitive issues. He has since apologized, he told Gross.\n\nRecall that Biden and his handlers took advantage of the pandemic lockdowns by remaining out of public sight as much as possible during that presidential campaign.\n\nEven hidden away as he was, it became clear that something was amiss, as he fumbled his way through the campaign, misstating the Declaration of Independence in Texas, telling a South Carolina crowd that he was running for the Senate, and stating in an Iowa appearance that “poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.”\n\nDan Quayle never lived down misspelling “potato,” and the media has stapled Donald Trump’s comment about “good people on both sides” to him for years, but the “poor kids” gaffe disappeared from view almost as soon as Biden said it.\n\nThree weeks before the 2024 debate with Trump, Wall Street Journal reporters Annie Linskey and Siobhan Hughes highlighted his mental issues under the headline, “Behind Closed Doors, Biden Shows Signs of Slipping,” only to be roundly accused of a partisan hatchet job, kicked off by a CNN analysis disparaging the reporters’ work as akin to Fox News and stating that the Journal “owed its readers – and the public – better.”\n\nThe irony in that statement cries out for ridicule: It was the rest of the national media that owed the public better, so afraid of giving people information that might help Trump that they abdicated their responsibility and hid the truth. \n\nAdding to the burgeoning evidence of the massive cover-up regarding Biden’s condition was the public access to the Hur interview, which the former president’s allies had tried to prevent.\n\nA transcript of the interview was released last year, but listening to Biden’s feeble attempts to remember details and complete his thoughts cast a different light and made obvious why his administration tried desperately to keep it from the public before and even after he ended his 2024 campaign.\n\nFollowing the interview, Hur ruled that Biden had “willfully” kept the documents, but said, devastatingly, that any jury would find him a “sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,” and no charges were ultimately filed.\n\nFollowing that, Democrats venomously attacked Hur as a result, calling his comments a politically motivated cheap shot. Kamala Harris, among many others, rushed to Biden’s defense, casting Hur’s description as “gratuitous, inaccurate and inappropriate.”\n\nTo the contrary, it is painful to listen to the interview posted by Axios Saturday, as Biden, responding to Hur’s respectful prodding, pathetically tries to remember when he left office as vice president and even when his beloved son Beau died, wandering off on tangents that had nothing to do with the questions being asked.\n\nThen Sunday came the announcement of Biden’s cancer diagnosis, which should generate only care and concern for his well-being.\n\nThis must be said, however: Even though Biden is now a private citizen, he was president until just four months ago.\n\nA president’s health is of national concern, and it is troubling that Biden, with access to the best health care in the country, should have a cancer as advanced as his that is just now being diagnosed, especially since he had been given repeated clean bills of health. \n\nIt’s reported that he hadn’t had a PSA screening, which can catch prostate cancer in its early stages, since 2014. While prevailing medical practice holds that PSA tests can be stopped after the age of 70, with a president, it would seem prudent to be more persistent than normal with testing for all sorts of health issues.\n\nThe bottom line to all the above is that Americans were woefully – and deliberately – uninformed and misinformed about the mental and physical capabilities of the man who was running for four more years as president until just four months shy of the election.\n\nThe truth is finally being spoken out loud – long after the fact.\n\nBut the question Democratic voters should be asking themselves is this: How can they ever again trust their leadership, and its media accomplices, to tell them the truth?\n\nAnd why should they? \n\nTed Diadiun is a member of the editorial board of cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer.\n\nTo reach Ted Diadiun: tdiadiun@cleveland.com\n\nHave something to say about this topic?\n\n* Send a letter to the editor, which will be considered for print publication.\n\n* Email general questions, comments or corrections regarding this opinion article to Elizabeth Sullivan, director of opinion, at esullivan@cleveland.com.","summary":"The bottom line is that Americans were woefully – and deliberately – uninformed and misinformed about the mental and physical capabilities of the man who was running for four more years as president until just four months shy of the election.
