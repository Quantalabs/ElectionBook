Harris insisted that it was deemed crucial to keep “absolute separation” between the Biden administration and the DoJ.\n\n“To give you an answer that will not satisfy your curiosity, I will tell you, we, perhaps to our damage, but we strongly and rightly believed that there should be an absolute separation between what we wanted as an administration and what the Department of Justice did. We absolutely adhered to that and it was right to do that,” Harris told Kimmel.\n\n“The Justice Department would make its decisions independent of any political or personal vendetta or concern that we may have and that’s the way it worked,” she added.\n\nHarris’s answer quickly inflamed left-wing pundits and social media personalities, who wanted the Biden White House to weaponize the Epstein files against then-candidate Trump. There’s an equal cacophony of laughter from conservative social media pockets, plenty of posts pointing out what Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow noted in his New York Times bestseller Breaking the Law, that “there is clear evidence there was collusion from the Joe Biden White House” and DoJ on the anti-Trump lawfare cases.\n\nHarris suggested that Trump could move to somehow block the DoJ from releasing the documents in full, as they are expected to be on Friday, and praised elected Republicans “who have stood up to say release the file.”\n\nThe lengthy interview began with Kimmel asking Harris to tell the now-well worn story about how her husband forgot to get her a birthday present during the 2024 campaign. A few minutes, and a ton of giggling later, Kimmel asked, “After the election, did you and Doug just start drinking?”\n\n“Let me just say that we definitly, um, it took some time,” Harris said.\n\nKimmel then got into some Biden questions. Harris said she hasn’t spoken to the former president in “about three or four weeks.” Asked if she believed Biden and his team did everything they could to help her win the election, Harris said she didn’t get the support she needed from “certain places in the administration.”\n\nKimmel then trained his attention on President Donald Trump, asking Harris if it’s hypocritical that so much attention was spent focusing on Biden’s aging and his mental state by people who won’t now criticize Trump for appearing to fall asleep during meetings.\n\n“You think.” Harris said to raucous laughter from Kimmel and the live studio audience.\n\nThe discussion devolved into a therapy session from there, with the pair taking turns lobbing insults at Trump while searching for the best way to cope with his return to power.","summary":"Failed presidential candidate Kamala Harris struggled to explain to ABC's left-wing late-night host Jimmy Kimmel why the Joe Biden Department of Justice never attempted to release documents pertaining to convicted sex offender Jeffery Epstein.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) told reporters Wednesday that she would “stomp” Vice President JD Vance in a hypothetical 2028 presidential election.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported Wednesday, a national poll revealed that Ocasio-Cortez would defeat Vance in a head-to-head matchup by two points nationally, 51 to 49 percent.\n\n“The New York Democratic congresswoman, known as AOC, edges the likely Republican nominee 51 percent to 49 percent, in The Argument/Verasight survey released on Tuesday,” wrote far-left Newsweek. “However, the result was within the poll’s 2.7 percentage point margin of error, making the two candidates statistically tied. The poll asked voters who they would vote for if the election were between the two of them.”\n\nWhen asked about the poll, AOC was all smiles with those incredible horse teeth of hers…\n\n“These polls like three years out—they are what they are,” she said, before adding: “But let the record show I would stomp him. I would stomp him!”\n\nJD Vance right now must be dropping to his knees daily to pray, “Please, please, please, please, please, AOC, please, please, please, please, please.”\n\nI might be missing a few “pleases.”\n\nCan you imagine Rep.

As I said, a lot can happen in three years, and both Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris came pretty close to winning the presidency.

Hicks takes over after Dolan last week finalized a plan to establish a $300 million fund to compensate victims of sexual abuse who had sued the archdiocese.\n\nHicks addressed the matter during his news conference Thursday.\n\n“As a church, we can never rest in our efforts to prevent abuse, to protect children and to care for survivors,” he said. “While this work is challenging, it’s difficult, it’s painful, I hope it will continue to help in the areas of accountability, transparency and healing.”\n\nDolan had submitted his resignation in February, as required when he turned 75. But the Vatican often waits to make important leadership changes in dioceses if there is lingering abuse litigation or other governance matters that need to be resolved by the outgoing bishop.\n\nThe handover, though, represents a significant new chapter for the U.S. Catholic Church, which is forging a new era with the Chicago-born Leo as the first American pope. Leo and the U.S. hierarchy have already shown willingness to challenge the Trump administration on immigration and other issues, and Hicks is seen as very much a Leo-style bishop.\n\n“I accept this appointment with humility and an open heart,” Hicks said. “I ask for your support and your prayers, and I ask God to support us as always.”\n\nAs he referred to Hicks as “an early Christmas gift for the Archdiocese,” Dolan said he didn’t know Hicks before he was chosen as his successor. “The last week, since I found out, I’ve gotten to know him, and I already love him and appreciate him and trust him.”\n\nA call for solidarity with immigrants\n\nHicks, 58, grew up in South Holland, Illinois, a short distance from the suburban Chicago childhood home of Leo, the former Robert Prevost.\n\nLike Prevost, who spent 20 years as a missionary in Peru, Hicks worked for five years in El Salvador heading a church-run orphanage program that operated in nine Latin American and Caribbean countries. Hicks said he was excited about getting to know the New York area and the people who live there, but jokingly noted he needed to make a controversial statement that “I’m a Cubs fan and I love deep dish pizza,” an homage to his Chicago roots.\n\n“Taking a new position as archbishop of New York is an enormous responsibility, but I can honestly say that Bishop Hicks is up to the task,” said the Rev. Eusebius Martis, who has known Hicks since the mid-1980s and worked with him at Mundelein Seminary, the Chicago archdiocesan seminary.\n\nHe said New York was lucky to have him.\n\n“He is a wonderful man, always thoughtful and attentive to the needs of seminarians,” Martis, professor of sacramental theology at the Pontifical Liturgical Institute of Sant’Anselmo, the Benedictine University in Rome, said in an email.\n\nIn November, Hicks endorsed a special message from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops condemning the Trump administration’s immigration raids, which have targeted Chicago in particular.\n\nIn a statement then urging Catholics to share the message, Hicks said it “affirms our solidarity with all our brothers and sisters as it expresses our concerns, opposition, and hopes with clarity and conviction. It is grounded in the church’s enduring commitment to the Catholic social teaching of human dignity and a call for meaningful immigration reform.”\n\nA similar hometown\n\nThough they both hail from Chicago, Hicks only met the future pope in 2024, when then-Cardinal Prevost visited one of Hicks’ parishes and took part in a question and answer conversation for the public.\n\nHicks, who sat in the front pew, said he learned that day what sort of future pope Leo would be and said he liked what he saw both in his public remarks and then in their private conversation. “Five minutes turned into 10 minutes and the 10 minutes turned into 15 and the 15 turned into 20,” Hicks told local Chicago WGN-TV news after Leo’s May election.\n\nHe said he recognized their shared backgrounds and priorities to build bridges. “We grew up literally in the same radius, in the same neighborhood together. We played in the same parks, went swimming in the same pools, like the same pizza places.”\n\nHicks served as a parish priest in Chicago and dean of training at Mundelein Seminary before Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich made him vicar general of the archdiocese in 2015. Three years later, Hicks was made an auxiliary bishop, and in 2020 Pope Francis named him bishop of Joliet, serving around 520,000 Catholics in seven counties.\n\nCupich, seen as a progressive in the U.S. church, has been a close adviser to both Francis and Leo, and Hicks’ appointment to such a prominent job likely could not have come without Cupich’s endorsement.\n\nA pastor for New York\n\nThe New York archdiocese is among the largest in the nation, serving roughly 2.5 million Catholics in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island in New York City, as well as seven counties to the north. \n\nThe gregarious Dolan is one of the most high-profile Catholic leaders in the United States and a prominent voice in the city.\n\nDolan is widely viewed as conservative, writing a 2018 Wall Street Journal column headlined “The Democrats Abandon Catholics.” Yet in 2023, he also wrote a letter of welcome to a conference at Fordham University celebrating outreach programs aimed at LGBTQ+ Catholics, and he welcomed LGBTQ+ participation in the city’s annual St. Patrick’s Day parade.\n\nDolan has ties to the current Republican administration. As archbishop of New York, Dolan hosted the annual Al Smith white-tie dinner that raises millions of dollars for Catholic charities. It has traditionally offered candidates from both parties the chance to trade lighthearted barbs ahead of Election Day, though in 2024 only Donald Trump participated since Democratic nominee Kamala Harris declined the invitation.\n\nTrump, who has long-standing connections to his native New York City, later had the cardinal pray at his inauguration and appointed Dolan to his new Religious Liberty Commission.\n\nDolan was Trump’s pick to succeed Pope Francis, though Dolan did criticize the president for sharing an AI-generated image of Trump, who is not a Catholic, dressed up as a pope before the May conclave that ultimately elected Leo.\n\nDolan was named archbishop of New York by Pope Benedict XVI in February 2009 after serving as archbishop of Milwaukee. He was made cardinal in 2012 and headed the U.S. bishops conference from 2010-2013.\n\nA first task to oversee abuse settlements\n\nIn one of his biggest first tasks, Hicks will have to oversee the implementation of the abuse settlement fund that Dolan finalized, which is to be paid for by reducing the archdiocesan budget and selling off assets. The aim is to cover settlements for most, if not all of the roughly 1,300 outstanding abuse claims against the archdiocese.\n\nHicks is no stranger to managing the fallout of the abuse scandal, after the Joliet diocese under his predecessors and the rest of the Illinois church came under scathing criticism by the state’s attorney general in 2023.\n\nA five-year investigation found that 451 Catholic clergy abused 1,997 children in Illinois between 1950 and 2019. Hicks had been appointed to lead the Joliet church in 2020. The attorney general’s report was generally positive in recognizing the diocese’s current child protection policies, but documented several cases where previous Joliet bishops moved known abusers around, disparaged victims and refused to accept responsibility for their role in enabling the abuse.\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

And that pessimism — as well as chaos fatigue — could derail his agenda in the November 2026 midterm elections when all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and 35 U.S. Senate seats will be on the ballot. Trump’s agenda depends on the support of a Republican majority of seven in the House and a Republican majority of six in the Senate.\n\nIndigenous voters could have a hand in shaping the new Congress next year, with several important races in states with significant Native populations. Among the well-known Native candidates: former U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, running for governor of New Mexico; Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, running for U.S. Senate; and U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids of Kansas, who is reported to be weighing a run for the Senate if not re-election to her congressional seat.\n\nThe midterm elections begin with primaries starting in early 2026 and conclude with the general election on Nov. 3, 2026. \n\nTrump’s mandate is a slim one. Kamala Harris would be in the White House if a combined 226,000 voters in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania had had more confidence in the economy in 2024. Trump’s approval rating on Nov. 30 was below 40 percent in those states, according to a Newsweek polling map.\n\n“I think the election results from this year are definitely showing where the country is moving,” said Shasti Conrad, chairwoman of the Washington state Democratic Party and a vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, referring to the election this fall of Democrats as governors in New Jersey and Virginia and as mayors in New York and Miami. \n\nIn Tennessee, Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn lost a U.S. House bid to Republican Matt Van Epps by a 9-point margin, in a district that voted 60 percent for Trump in 2024 and has been represented by a Republican since 1983. William Lyons, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, told Newsweek before the election that a single-digit finish by Behn “would represent a positive sign for Democrats next year.”\n\n“The Republicans have way overreached in many areas and they’ve not actually fixed any of the problems that they claimed that they would, like making it easier to buy groceries and lower gas prices and make life more affordable,” Conrad said. “I think that people are frustrated and they’re tired of the chaos and there are a lot of Trump voters that are having buyer’s remorse.”\n\nRepublican political strategist Mike Stopp, Cherokee/Muscogee, said what the economy looks like early fall next year will determine whether Republicans gain or lose seats in Congress in the November elections.\n\n“There are some social issues and immigration issues that will have a role, but really, at the end of the day, every election is about the economy,” Stopp told ICT.\n\n“Every election is about those middle-of-the road voters – not the hardcore right or the hardcore left – and how their pocketbook is affected,” Stopp said. “That’s what’s going to make a difference. And if some of the things that President Trump is trying to put into place go the way he expects them to, then I would expect to see a better turnout for Republicans in November.” \n\nHere are some congressional and state races ICT will be watching in 2026.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, Yup’ik, a Democrat, is considering a candidacy for governor or U.S. Senate in her home state of Alaska. Polls show her about even with Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan, who is running for reelection to the Senate. Alaska’s non-partisan, ranked-choice primary is scheduled for Aug. 18, 2026.\n\nAlaska, population 740,133, had a Native population of 124,273 in the 2020 U.S. Census.\n\nPeltola served in the Alaska House of Representatives from 1999 to 2009, the Bethel City Council from 2011-2013, and then as a tribal court judge and executive director of the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission. \n\nShe won a special election in 2022 to succeed Republican U.S. Rep. Don Young, who died in office, and later that year won election to a full term. She served on the House Committee on Natural Resources and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Her moderate views earned her endorsements from Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and the National Rifle Association.\n\nShe was defeated in her 2024 re-election bid by Republican Nick Begich, and left office in January. \n\nFormer Navajo Nation Chairman Jonathan Nez and former state Rep. Eric Descheenie, also Navajo, are seeking the Democratic nomination for the U.S. House from Arizona’s 2nd Congressional District. The Arizona primary is scheduled for Aug. 4, 2026; the winner will face Republican Eli Crane, who is seeking a second term.\n\nArizona, population 7.1 million, had a Native population of 335,909 in the 2020 Census.\n\nNez supports mail-in voting, a big issue among rural voters; investing in security technology and hiring more border agents and caseworkers along the southern border. He also supports establishing a pathway to citizenship “for those who work hard and play by the rules,” investments in opioid addiction prevention and treatment, protecting water and the climate, and “putting the needs of rural Arizona ahead of partisan politics to deliver meaningful change.”\n\nDescheenie said on his website that he will work for a future “that puts people and decency first … One that prioritizes basic human rights such as universal healthcare, a livable wage, affordable housing, fully funded public education and adequate and clean drinking water.”\n\nCrane lists his priorities as securing the border, protecting gun ownership rights, ensuring the integrity of elections, lowering taxes, and increasing domestic energy production. \n\nA special election will take place on March 17, 2026, in Georgia’s 14th Congressional District to choose a successor to U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican and former Trump ally who announced she would resign effective Jan. 5, 2026. The primary election for a full two-year term will take place May 19, followed by the general election six months later. \n\nGeorgia, population 10.7 million, had a Native population of 57,917 in the 2020 Census. \n\nAmong the Democratic Party candidates is retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Shawn Harris. He lost to Greene 64.4 to 35.6 percent in 2024.\n\nHarris supports investing in improved access to healthcare, including mental health and substance abuse services; restoring protections and restrictions under Roe v. Wade; negotiating prices with pharmaceutical companies for Medicare, Medicaid and exchange health plans; and legislation that would prevent price gouging. \n\nHe wants to improve roads and water systems in rural areas; expand broadband access; and invest in law enforcement and public safety. He supports immigration reform, expansion of asylum processing and improving standards for vetting of those entering the country. \n\nAmong the Republican candidates is Georgia State Sen. Colton Moore, who announced his candidacy on Dec. 9. In his announcement on social media, he wrote that he is “100% Pro-Trump, 100% Pro-Life, 100% Pro-Gun,” and supports the administration’s immigration and economic policies, citing “cheap gas and groceries.” \n\nMoore has served as a state legislator for seven years. \n\nFormer Idaho state Rep. Paulette Jordan, Coeur d’Alene, is a Democratic candidate for governor. If she wins her party’s primary on May 19, 2026 she would face Gov. Brad Little, a Republican who is seeking a third term, in the general election. \n\nIdaho, population 1.8 million, had a Native population of 29,347 in the 2020 Census. \n\nJordan served on the Coeur d’Alene Tribal Council and, from 2014-2018, in the Idaho House of Representatives. She was the Democratic nominee for governor in 2018 and for U.S. Senate in 2020. \n\nJordan supports investing in education to help train people for jobs that provide livable wages; expanding Medicaid to help thousands of Idahoans get the primary care and coverage; protecting all people from discrimination; further developing wind, solar and other renewable energy sources; protecting natural resources; and keeping public lands public.\n\nLittle’s campaign website states he has cut or simplified regulations, easing burdens on small businesses and residents; achieved a budget surplus and provided tax relief to Idahoans; invested in veterans homes and scholarships for members of the state’s National Guard; invested in education, literacy and workforce training; and invested in agriculture, broadband, transportation and water without raising taxes.\n\nAnthony Tamez-Pochel, Sicangu Lakota and Black, is a Democratic candidate for Congress from Illinois’ 5th District. He is one of four candidates challenging incumbent Rep. Mike Quigley for the Democratic nomination. Quigley is seeking a ninth term and served on House committees on appropriations and intelligence. \n\nThe Illinois primary is scheduled for March 17. Illinois, population 12.8 million, had a Native population of 280,000 in the 2020 Census.\n\nTamez-Pochel was elected in 2023 to represent District 17 on the Chicago Police District Council and is believed to be the only Native American currently in elective office in Illinois.\n\nAs a police district council member, Tamez-Pochel has worked to promote accountability and incorporate the community’s voice into matters of public safety. He is active with Chi-Nations, a grassroots collective creating safe spaces for Native youth through art, activism and education.\n\nIf elected, he told ICT in an earlier interview, he would work to protect individual data privacy, expand access to health care, roll back the Trump administration’s anti-immigration policies, protect Native sovereignty and honor treaty rights.\n\nRepublican candidates include business owner Tom Hanson; Dr. Kimball Ladien, MD; and Barry Wicker, a licensed engineer. \n\nDemocrat Sharice Davids, Ho-Chunk, is a lawyer and a four-term member of Congress from Kansas’ 3rd District. She’s no stranger to toughing it out — she’s a former amateur and professional MMA fighter, one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress, and the first openly LGBTQ congresswoman from Kansas. \n\nDavids survived an earlier attempt by the Kansas legislature to weaken her re-election chances through redistricting. She may run for the U.S. Senate if the legislature follows through with a mid-decade redistricting plan, but she has until June 1, 2026, to file her candidacy. The primary is scheduled for Aug. 4, 2026. \n\nKansas, population 2.9 million, had a Native population of 34,407 in the 2020 Census.\n\nA Senate candidacy would be a challenge. Kansans have not elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate since 1932, and incumbent Republican Sen. Roger Marshall has Trump’s endorsement for reelection. \n\nMaine State Auditor Matthew Dunlap, a Democrat, and former Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican, are candidates for Congress from Maine’s 2nd District. An early poll showed LePage leading 47 to 37 percent, but the error rate was +/- 4.9 percent – and 16 percent of voters were undecided. \n\nThe Maine primary is scheduled for June 9. The incumbent, Jared Golden, a Democrat, is not seeking reelection.\n\nMaine, population 1.3 million, had a Native population of 8,328 in the 2020 Census.\n\nDunlap previously served as Maine’s secretary of state and as a state representative.\n\n“Long before I was in public service, I worked every job I could get — bartender, cook, dishwasher, even a fur trapper,” Dunlap wrote on his X account, formerly known as Twitter. “I’m running for Congress to fight for working-class Mainers every day … Every week, I hear about families struggling with healthcare, rent, and childcare. I’m running for Congress to fight for a people’s agenda: lower healthcare costs, an expanded Child Tax Credit, good-paying jobs, affordable housing and childcare.”\n\nLePage said he supports lowering costs and inflation; supports Trump’s immigration policies; will work to lower taxes and cut red tape; will protect Second Amendment rights; and protect Social Security and Medicare.\n\nLePage’s tenure as governor from 2011-2019 was marked by conflicts with tribal nations over casino development, land claims, resource management and water rights. \n\nDiop Harris, Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi, is one of four Democrats seeking nomination for the U.S. House of Representatives from Michigan’s 4th District. The primary is scheduled for Aug. 4, 2026. \n\nIf Harris wins the primary, he will face incumbent Rep. Bill Huizenga, Republican, who is seeking a second term. Michigan, population 10 million, had a Native population of 64,312 in the 2020 Census.\n\nHarris has said he was inspired to go into public service by the legacy of civil rights icon John Lewis. After earning a degree in public policy from Michigan State University, Harris served as a field organizer, campaign staffer, and later as a legislative correspondent for Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, connecting constituents to federal services. He is active with the Battle Creek NAACP, where he advocates for justice, equity and opportunity for working families across Michigan.\n\nHis cites as a top priority to “revolutionize our economy to be cleaner and more sustainable – not just rethinking our energy system, but how we produce and consume things.” He also support making investments to “bring entire industries into their next generation,” a reform curriculum “to ensure students can learn from our past and the present, and have the skills to fully participate in society,” lowering the cost of post-secondary education and providing relief from student debt, and improving veterans’ access to healthcare. including mental health, and good-paying jobs.\n\nHuizenga, a former state legislator, serves on the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs and Committee on Financial Services. He supports a Balanced Budget Amendment; opposes abortion; introduced bipartisan legislation to improve mental health resources for veterans; supports increasing American energy supplies; and supports efforts to secure the border. \n\nMinnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, White Earth Nation, is a candidate for U.S. Senate. If elected, she would be the first Native American woman to serve in the Senate. The Minnesota primary is scheduled for Aug. 11, 2026. \n\nMinnesota, 5.7 million population, had a Native population of 71,559 in the 2020 Census. \n\nFlanagan, a Democrat, was elected to the Minneapolis school board at age 25 — the youngest and the first Native American elected to the school board — and later served as executive director of the Minnesota Children’s Defense Fund. She was elected to the state House of Representatives in 2015 and as lieutenant governor in 2019. She co-chaired the 2024 Democratic National Convention.\n\nDuring her public service career, Flanagan has championed paid family and medical leave, free school meals, investments in housing, missing and murdered Indigenous people prevention, land back efforts, and Native language revitalization.\n\nOther declared candidates are U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., who has represented Minnesota’s 2nd Congressional District since 2019; Royce White, former NBA player and Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in 2024; and Adam Schwarze, Republican, a former Navy SEAL.\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, Laguna Pueblo, is a Democratic candidate for governor. If elected she would succeed Michelle Lujan Grishan, who is retiring because of term limits.\n\nThe New Mexico primary is scheduled for June 2, 2026. New Mexico, population 2.1 million, had a Native population of 214,334 in the 2020 Census.\n\nHaaland served as chair of the New Mexico Democratic Party from 2015-2017, as a member of the U.S. House from 2019-2021, and as Interior secretary from 2021-2025. She said on her campaign website that her priorities are jobs, health, housing, education and safety.\n\n“Deb knows that jobs, health, housing, education, and safety will help New Mexico families prosper,” her website states. “But she also knows that New Mexicans must be the ones to build our own future. Crime, poverty, homelessness, addiction, wildfires, drought, and more will keep pulling us down if we keep doing the same things and expecting a different result.”\n\nOther candidates for the Democratic nomination: Sam Bregman, Bernalillo County district attorney in New Mexico; and former Las Cruces mayor Ken Miyagishima.\n\nCandidates for the Republican nomination include Rio Rancho Mayor Gregg Hull and Duke Rodriguez, CEO of a company that produces medical-grade cannabis and cannabis-based medicines.\n\nFormer U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, is seeking election to the Senate seat vacated by JD Vance when he became vice president. The Ohio primary is scheduled for May 5, 2026.\n\nIf Brown wins the primary, he would face Jon Husted, who was appointed to the position in January. Husted is a former Ohio state legislator and lieutenant governor. \n\nOhio, population 11.8 million, had a Native population of 35,754 in the 2020 Census.\n\nBrown served in the U.S. House from 1993-2007 and in the Senate from 2007-2025. He chaired the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; and served on the Agriculture, Ethics, Finance, and Veterans’ Affairs committees.\n\nBrown lists among his accomplishments his work to protect pensions and full Social Security payments; cap the cost of insulin and reduce the price of other prescription drugs; and get veterans care for illnesses caused by exposure to toxins.\n\nBrown “believes too many people think of politics as left or right, but to him it’s all about whose side you’re on, and who you are fighting for,” his campaign website states. “With all the craziness coming out of Washington, including giving massive tax breaks to corporations and billionaires at the expense of hardworking Ohioans, Sherrod knows he has the ability to do something about it, and that’s why he’s running for Senate.”\n\nHusted’s campaign points to his accomplishments as a legislator in “creating a strong economy, a thriving community, and a pro-business environment Ohioans can rely on.” He helped attract Intel’s chip manufacturing facility to Licking County; implemented Online Driver’s License Renewal, Online Title Transfer, and other digital services; led the passage of the most fiscally conservative budget in 40 years; and delivered an income tax cut, reportedly one of the largest ever in Ohio. \n\nState Rep. Cyndi Munson is, as of this writing, the lone Democratic candidate for governor. She hopes to succeed Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, Cherokee, who is term-limited. The primary is scheduled for June 16, 2026. \n\nSix candidates are seeking the Republican nomination, among them Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond and former Oklahoma House Speaker Charles McCall.\n\nOklahoma, population 3.9 million, had a Native population of 341,399 in the 2020 Census.\n\nMunson, the first Asian-American elected to Oklahoma’s legislature, was a nonprofit executive before being elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives in 2015. She served on the Oversight Committee for the Legislative Office for Fiscal Transparency and in 2022 became House minority leader. \n\nMunson’s priorities: Investments in public schools and teacher pay, tax relief for Oklahomans, lower health care costs, and repeal of Oklahoma’s abortion ban. “As your next Governor, I’ll work every day to make Oklahoma a place where every family can afford groceries, healthcare, and rent,” she wrote on X. \n\nU.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Democrat, is expected to seek a third term representing the state’s 3rd Congressional District. She would likely again be challenged by Joe Kent, a retired U.S. Army warrant officer who has served as the director of the National Counterterrorism Center since July 31, 2025. \n\nThe Washington primary is scheduled for Aug. 5, 2026. Washington, population 7.7 million, had a Native population of 186,401 in the 2020 Census. \n\nPerez — described by Politico as a “Blue-Collar, Bible-Quoting, Israel-Supporting, Pro-Choice, Millennial Latina” — defeated Kent 51.7 to 47.9 percent in 2024 and 50.41 to 49.59 percent in 2022. She went on to serve on the House Appropriations, Agriculture and Small Business committees and co-sponsored 43 bipartisan bills that passed the House.\n\nKent is a longtime supporter of Trump’s agenda. In past campaigns, he called the economy “the biggest issue as it pretty much affects everybody” and said he would “oppose the endless deficits and big government spending that’s driving this record inflation.” On immigration, Kent said securing the border should be a priority over “providing foreign aid to other nations and fighting in foreign wars.” He supports expanding access to school choice “so that federal dollars follow the students and not the education bureaucracy.”\n\nLooking ahead\n\nMeanwhile, Conrad, the Democratic leader in Washington state, is looking ahead to the expectations that will be on Democrats should they regain the majority in 2026. \n\n“I really liked what Gov. Tim Walz from Minnesota said a couple months ago: When we get back in power, people are going to want us to swing for the fences and not just talk about how hard it is to get things done. No, they’re going to want us to deliver,” Conrad said. “They’re going to want us to deliver on affordable housing, on access to affordable health care. They’re going to want to see us actually getting things done. And I think that Democrats are realizing that we’ve got to be ready to do that and move at the pace that people want to see.”\n\nStopp wants Americans to know that Congress is populated with people who do good and often bipartisan work — work that may not always be reflected in the messaging by congressional leadership. \n\n“I’m a former chief of staff to a member of Congress,” Stopp said. “What surprised me when I got there was that the majority of members are elected because they love this country and they want to see good things. We may disagree on how we get there, but most of them want the best for this country. And so, there is always the possibility of bipartisanship. The challenge comes from leadership and national messaging, and that’s both parties, and then it’s getting it across the football field.” \n\nHe added, “The sky’s not falling folks. Just keep getting out there doing good things. Partisanship in this country is going to tear us apart long before anything that comes out of Washington. Just don’t forget who your neighbors are.”\n\nMORE INFOMIDTERMS AT A GLANCEEarliest candidate filings: Each state sets its own dates for candidate filing deadlines and primary elections.

Not all of those boasts were credible. \n\nAmong them:\n\nOn inflation\n\nTRUMP: He blamed Democrats for handing him an “inflation disaster,” “the worst in the history of our country,” and said that now, the prices of turkey and eggs have come down and “everything else is falling rapidly. And it’s not done yet. But boy, are we making progress.”\n\nTHE FACTS: His claim that prices are falling rapidly is not seen in the inflation numbers, which are about where they were when he took office, after having fallen significantly before the end of Joe Biden’s presidency. Nor is it true that the Biden era gave the country its worst inflation ever.\n\nThe consumer price index was 3% in September, the same rate as in January, a tick up from 2.9% in December, Biden’s last full month in office. In an AP-NORC poll this month, the vast majority of U.S. adults said they’ve noticed higher than usual prices for groceries, electricity and holiday gifts in recent months. \n\nBiden-era inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, a consequence of supply chain interruptions, potentially excessive amounts of government aid and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine driving up food and energy costs. Americans have known even worse and more sustained inflation than that: higher than 13% in 1980 during an extended period of price pain. By some estimates, inflation approached 20% during World War I.\n\nInflation had been falling during the first few months of Trump’s presidency, but it picked back up after the president announced his tariffs in April.\n\nOn investment\n\nTRUMP: “I secured a record-breaking $18 trillion of investment into the United States.”\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump has presented no evidence that he’s secured this much domestic or foreign investment for the United States. Based on statements from various companies, foreign countries and the White House’s own website, that figure appears to be exaggerated, highly speculative and far higher than the actual sum.\n\nEven the White House website offers a far lower number, $9.6 trillion, and that figure appears to include some investment commitments made during Biden’s presidency.\n\nTrump has routinely claimed rosy investment numbers, without offering the details to support them. Trump nailed down some of the investment terms in an October trip to Japan and South Korea, but they’re over multiple years and it remains to be seen how ironclad those commitments and others will be.\n\nA landslide?\n\nTRUMP: “I was elected in a landslide, winning the popular vote and all seven swing states and everything else, with a mandate to take on a sick and corrupt system.”\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump won a decisive victory but hardly a landslide one, however you define a landslide. Trump, who became president with 312 electoral votes, won fewer than Democrats Barack Obama in 2008 (365) and 2012 (332) and Bill Clinton in 1992 (370) and 1996 (379).\n\nThe electoral performance of those men pales in comparison with the sweeps by Franklin Roosevelt in 1936 (523), Lyndon Johnson in 1964 (486), Richard Nixon in 1972 (520) and Ronald Reagan (525) in 1984.\n\nTrump did win more popular votes than his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, but not quite a majority of them. His win in 2024 ranks among the more narrow.\n\nAssociated Press writers Josh Boak and Melissa Goldin contributed.\n\nFind AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-speech-fact-check-inflation-9d18903505dae93beb783594e435c72b","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/a5c0fb6/2147483647/strip/false/crop/7017x4678+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F51%2F61%2F85adb1892259374e4945f2cb3a22%2Fc69a83fe2a69440ca8a0cd6788d51310","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-18 04:21:49","author":"Calvin Woodward","authors":["Calvin Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.087},{"id":387340356,"title":"The Lumbee Tribe’s federal recognition is assured with a final push by Trump","text":"Graham Lee BrewerAssociated Press\n\nThe Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina achieved a goal more than a century in the making on Wednesday when it secured federal recognition as a tribal nation through the passage of a defense bill in Congress.\n\nThe state-recognized tribe, whose historic and genealogical claims have been called into question by several tribal leaders, has been seeking federal acknowledgement for generations. Congress has considered the issue for more than 30 years, but the effort gained momentum after President Donald Trump endorsed the state-recognized tribe on the campaign trail last year.\n\nLegislation to recognize the Lumbee Tribe had struggled to pass through Congress in recent years, but it was attached to the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, which was passed by the Senate on Wednesday afternoon. It was unclear when the president would sign it.\n\n“It means a lot because we have been figuring out how to get here for so long,” said Lumbee Tribal Chairman John Lowery moments after celebrating the victory in the office of North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. “We have been second-class Natives and we will never be that again, and no one can take it away from us.”\n\nWith federal recognition comes a bevy of federal resources, including access to new streams of federal dollars and grants and resources like the Indian Health Service. It also allows the tribe to put land into trust, which gives it more control over things like taxation and economic development, such as a casino.\n\nThe journey to recognition\n\nIn the 1980s, the Lumbee Tribe sought recognition through the Office of Federal Acknowledgement within the Interior Department, which evaluates the historical and genealogical claims of tribal applicants. The office declined to accept the application, citing a 1956 act of Congress that acknowledged the Lumbee Tribe but withheld the benefits of federal recognition.\n\nThat decision was reversed in 2016, allowing the Lumbee to pursue recognition through the federal administrative process. The tribe instead continued to seek recognition through an act of Congress.\n\nThere are 574 federally recognized tribal nations. Since the Office of Federal Acknowledgement was established in 1978, 18 have been approved by the agency, while about two dozen have gained recognition through congressional legislation. Nineteen applications ranging from Maine to Montana are now pending before the agency, with at least one under consideration by Congress.\n\nOnce federally recognized, the Lumbee Tribe would become one of the largest tribal nations in the country, with about 60,000 members. Congressional Budget Office estimates have found that providing the tribe with the necessary federal resources would cost hundreds of millions of dollars in the first few years alone.\n\n“Hopefully, Congress will expand the pie in appropriations so that the other tribes, many of which are poor, don’t suffer because there’s suddenly such a larger number of Native Americans in that region,” said Kevin Washburn, former assistant secretary of Indian affairs at the Interior Department and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law.\n\nOver 200 Lumbee members gathered in a gymnasium in Pembroke, North Carolina, to watch the final Senate vote on television. They celebrated with shouts, raised hands and applause as the unofficial tally indicated the bill would receive final congressional approval.\n\nVictor Dial held his 8-month daughter Collins at the celebration. Dial’s grandfather is a late former tribal chairman.\n\n“He told us the importance of this, and he told us this day would happen, but we didn’t know when,” Dial said. “I’m so glad my kids were here to see it.”\n\nDisputes over merit and heritage\n\nNot everyone in Indian Country is celebrating. The move has drawn opposition from some tribal leaders, historians and genealogists who argue that the Lumbee’s claims are unverifiable and that Congress should require the tribe to complete the formal recognition process.\n\n“Federal recognition does not create us — it acknowledges us,” Shawnee Tribe Chief Ben Barnes, an opponent of Lumbee recognition, testified before the Senate last month. He warned against replacing historical documentation with political considerations.\n\nCritics have noted that the Lumbee have a history of shifting claims and previously used different names, including Cherokee Indians of Robeson County, and say the tribe lacks a documented historical language.\n\n“If identity becomes a matter of assertion rather than continuity, then this body will not be recognizing tribes, it will be manufacturing them,” Barnes told lawmakers.\n\nThe Lumbee Tribe counters that it descends from a mixture of ancestors “from the Algonquian, Iroquoian and Siouan language families,” according to its website, and notes it has been recognized by North Carolina since 1885.\n\nPolitics influence tribal recognition\n\nWhile the Lumbee Tribe has received bipartisan support over the years, federal recognition became a campaign promise in 2024 for both Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\n“He kept that promise and showed extraordinary leadership,” said Tillis, the Republican senator who introduced a bill to recognize the Lumbee Tribe.\n\nRobeson County, where most Lumbee members live, has shifted politically in recent years. Once dominated by Democrats, the socially conservative area has trended Republican. The Lumbee Tribe’s members in North Carolina are an important voting block in the swing state, which Trump won by more than three points.\n\nIn January, Trump issued an executive order directing the Interior Department to develop a plan for Lumbee recognition. That plan was submitted to the White House in April, and a department spokesperson said the tribe was advised to pursue recognition through Congress.\n\nSince then, Lowery, the tribal chairman, has worked closely with members of Congress, particularly Tillis, and appealed directly to Trump. In September, Lowery wrote to Trump announcing ancestral ties between the Lumbee Tribe and the president’s daughter Tiffany Trump, according to Bloomberg, which first reported on the letter.\n\nAssociated Press writers Gary D.

Jen Kiggans (R-Va.), Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.), Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.) and others sought to cut a deal that would allow some sort of a House vote on a subsidy extension.\n\nGOP leaders, Fitzpatrick said, denied their requests to take one of their compromise measures directly to the floor. They were encouraged to file an amendment to the Johnson-backed health bill with the Rules Committee, but making their measures comply with GOP conference requirements became “unnecessarily complicated,” he said, as they forged ahead.\n\nJohnson’s allies counter that Fitzpatrick and the GOP moderates weren’t completely united and simply couldn’t deliver on the basic criteria Johnson laid out to strike a deal for an amendment. The speaker himself told reporters Tuesday, “I thought there was an agreement on the Fitzpatrick amendment and then they made different decisions.”\n\nUltimately, late Tuesday night, the Rules Committee voted to send a bill to the floor with no amendments.\n\n“So that’s what led us to today,” Fitzpatrick said Wednesday.\n\nThere is one silver lining for Johnson: Fitzpatrick went back to playing team ball soon after signing the Democratic discharge petition and voted to send Johnson’s health bill to the floor. He went on to vote to pass it: “I’m not going to vote against something out of spite.”\n\nFitzpatrick’s careful political balancing act will get a serious test this year as Democrats redouble their efforts to oust him from his swingy Bucks County district. He won his last race in 2024 by more than a dozen percentage points even as former Vice President Kamala Harris carried his district.\n\n“I think it demonstrates how much danger they’re in politically by siding with the MAGA majority, which was just throwing caution to the winds in terms of people’s health care,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). ”These are the desperate members of the Republican majority who are trying to hang on to their seats, and good for them that they understand what America wants.”\n\nAs Johnson was swarmed by reporters Wednesday morning asking about Fitzpatrick and the discharge petition, he said, “I have not lost control of the House.”\n\nFitzpatrick was a close ally of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy and is not seen as being especially close to Johnson. He could engage in additional freelancing in the coming year that would make governing the tiny Republican majority even more difficult for top party leaders.\n\nIn addition to the five discharge petitions he’s already signed this year, he is working with Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) to introduce another, on Russian sanctions.\n\n“Every time somebody says that’s a tool of the minority, I correct them — it’s a tool of the rank-and-file,” Fitzpatrick said earlier this month. “To weaken the discharge would be just to empower the [party leaders], and we need more rank-and-file empowerment.”","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/17/brian-fitzpatrick-obamacare-discharge-petition-00696644","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/17b3167/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F05%2Fbb%2Ff20d5791449f958f50f5e7898320%2Fu-s-congress-97689.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-17 23:16:00","author":"Mia McCarthy,Nicholas Wu","authors":["Mia McCarthy","Nicholas Wu"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.209},{"id":387347304,"title":"Clean energy grants cut by Trump administration are facing scrutiny","text":"An internal watchdog in the U.S. Department of Energy will investigate the Trump administration’s termination of $7.6 billion in grants for hundreds of clean energy projects across 16 states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe move is especially welcome for Democrats who said that the cuts — part of broader attacks from President Donald Trump on climate programs and clean energy funding — would slash projects boosting the electric grid, threaten thousands of manufacturing and construction jobs, and send Americans’ energy costs soaring.\n\nThe government’s lawyers confirmed in a court filing this week — in response to a lawsuit by several clean energy groups and the city of St. Paul over the canceled funding — that the selection of grants in fact, “was influenced by whether a grantee’s address was located in a State that tends to elect ... Democratic candidates in state and national elections (so-called “Blue States”).”\n\nThat contradicts the Energy Department’s earlier assertion that partisanship was not part of the cuts.\n\nSarah Nelson, acting inspector general for the Energy Department, said in a letter to members of Congress on Wednesday that the audit of the canceled funds will review “whether those cancellations were in accordance with established criteria.”\n\n“This work will help ensure that these activities are conducted consistently with applicable laws, regulations, and Departmental policies and procedures,” Nelson added.\n\nThe Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn October, the Energy Department announced that 321 funding awards across 223 projects were terminated, saying that after review, they “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”\n\nAt the time, White House budget director Russell Vought said awards across California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state would be cut. All 16 targeted states supported Harris, but Energy Secretary Chris Wright initially said the cuts were “business decisions on whether it’s a good use of the taxpayer money or not.”\n\nMore than two dozen Democratic members of Congress from California, led by California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla and Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, wrote a letter to the acting inspector general in late October requesting a formal investigation into the canceled funding, saying that the cuts “based on partisan criteria suggests significant unlawful bias.”\n\nThe letter said because the project funding came from the bipartisan infrastructure law, passed by Congress under former President Joe Biden, that the Department does not have the authority to terminate awards and that the decisions are “unlawful and will cause harm to Americans.”\n\nSchiff said in a statement he was pleased to see the investigation into what he called “clear political targeting ... intended to punish blue states.”\n\nThe cuts, which hit California the hardest, include more than $1 billion for a hydrogen hub there.\n\nAssociated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed to this report.

Business leaders, including those from almost every Big Tech company, stepped over themselves to prove fealty to Donald Trump's second administration. It's easy to see why: Their kowtowing was meant to secure regulatory favors, gain tax and tariff advantages and avoid Trump's ire. Ultimately, it was all in the service of appeasing their shareholders. Why else would Apple CEO Tim Cook, someone who typically cultivates a progressive image, hand deliver a gold plaque to the President of the United States?\n\nBefore we leave 2025 behind, it's worth documenting the many ways tech companies and leaders debased themselves for political favor with the Trump administration.\n\nAlphabet (Google)\n\nGoogle dropped diversity recruitment goals in February, following Trump’s executive orders dismantling DEI programs in the federal government. Google also changed its AI principles to allow AI in weapons and surveillance, a move that is in line with the relaxed artificial intelligence regulation the Trump administration would later adopt for its AI Action Plan. To the chagrin of geographers everywhere, the company also replaced the Gulf of Mexico in Google Maps with \"Gulf of America,\" following Trump's executive order.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle Donald Trump's lawsuit against YouTube, following the suspension of his YouTube accounts after the January 6th riot. Trump will receive $22 million, while another $2.5 million of the settlement will be paid out to additional plaintiffs who were part of the class action — which is to say, other rioters involved in the storming of the Capitol.\n\nJoining plenty of other tech companies, Google donated $1 million to the Trump inauguration, and it’s also contributing to the cost of Trump’s reported $300 million White House ballroom.\n\nIn August, Amazon Web Services said it would provide up to $1 billion in credits to the Trump administration through 2028. Those credits can be put towards AWS cloud services, training and certification and direct contracts.\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos also did his fair share to support Trump: He donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration, and since purchasing the Washington Post in 2013 he pushed the paper to the right. This year, Bezos declared that the Post’s opinion pages would be devoted to the support and defense of “personal liberties” and “free markets.” He added, “We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.\" To that end, the Post also hired three new conservative columnists. Bezos reportedly also blocked his paper from endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nAmazon, too, is contributing to Trump's $300 million White House ballroom. The Washington Post, unsurprisingly, was one of the first major publications to praise Trump’s ballroom.\n\nApple relied on big numbers and flashy trinkets to ingratiate itself to the Trump administration. In February, it said it planned to invest $500 billion into the US economy over the next four years. While that sounds impressive, Apple previously announced another $430 billion multi-year investment for the US in 2021. In a potential bid to avoid the administration’s volatile tariff plans, Apple also said it would invest another $100 billion into the US in August.\n\nTim Cook personally donated $1 million to the Trump inauguration fund, Cook's first political donation since 2017. At that August event, he also gave Donald Trump a now infamous gold statue for being a special little guy.\n\nAdditionally, Apple followed in Google’s footsteps by replacing the Gulf of Mexico in Apple Maps with the “Gulf of America.” The company is also chipping in for Trump’s $300 million White House ballroom.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wasted no time trying to get into Trump’s good graces, perhaps to erase his previous statement that the President should be “held responsible for his words” for inciting the January 6 Capitol riot. On top of donating $1 million to Trump's inauguration, Meta announced that it would be getting rid of third-party fact-checkers on Facebook and Instagram on January 7. Instead, it's relying on community notes similar to X. Meta also ended its DEI initiatives and changed its hate speech rules to allow for calling LGBTQ people “mentally ill.”\n\n\"We do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality and common non-serious usage of words such as 'weird,'\" reads the company’s updated policy.\n\nEven Zuckerberg’s charity, which he runs alongside his wife, bowed to Trump. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative ended its diversity programs and stopped providing “social advocacy funding,” which supported immigration and racial equity efforts. According to The Guardian, the charity’s website removed every reference to diversity or promoting scientific research from underrepresented groups.\n\nSimilar to Google, Meta said it will pay Donald Trump $25 million to settle his lawsuit related to his Facebook suspension after the January 6 riot. And yes, Meta is also contributing to Trump's $300 million White House ballroom.\n\nMicrosoft contributed $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund. Previously, it donated $500,000 to Biden's fund and the same amount for Trump's first term. It’s also contributing to Trump’s $300 million White House ballroom.\n\nSimilar to Amazon, Microsoft also offered up to $3.1 billion worth of services to the Trump administration as part of the American-centric “OneGov” strategy. That includes discounts for Microsoft 365, Azure cloud services and cybersecurity tools. Copilot AI will also be discounted to government agencies, and it’ll be completely free for a year for agencies subscribing to Microsoft G5 service.\n\nElon Musk (X, SpaceX, Tesla)\n\nElon Musk was by far the biggest booster for Trump in the business world. He spent a whopping total of $277 million to back Trump and other candidates in 2024, including $239 million to America PAC, his super PAC focused on securing votes for Trump and other Republicans.\n\nMusk went so far as to offer $1 million to people who said they would vote for Trump, a move that the Justice Department warned might be illegal. Wisconsin's Attorney General challenged Musk's ploy but the state's Supreme Court declined to hear a case on the matter, thereby giving Musk leeway to award two $1 million checks to voters. Musk's team edited a video of one of the recipients to remove her admission that she was paid \"to vote.\"\n\nHe also joked that he could be jailed if Kamala Harris won the 2024 election, which could be referencing potential election fraud, his penchant for busting unions, national security concerns from his uncomfortably close relationship with Vladimir Putin or any number of potential crimes.\n\nElon Musk spearheaded DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency), an unelected position from which he was given nearly unprecedented federal oversight. Once installed he hired his techie acolytes to chip away at government budgets and staffs. For the first few weeks of the second Trump administration, it appeared as if Musk had unfettered power to manipulate the government.\n\nAnd let's not forget, while leading DOGE, the world's richest man also destroyed USAID, the world's largest food aid provider, for no apparent reason other than cruelty.\n\nAfter purchasing Twitter in 2022 and renaming it \"X,\" Musk has also transformed Twitter into a Trump-friendly social network focused on “free speech.” He reinstated Trump’s Twitter account, which was banned after the January 6 Capitol riot, and he also paid Trump around $10 million to settle his lawsuit over being kicked off the platform. X is now a platform that amplifies far-right extremists, treats the inclusive term “cisgender” as a slur and doesn’t punish users for deadnaming and misgendering trans people.\n\nWhat about the rest?\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive documenting of every single tech tycoon that has bent the knee. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, for instance, told Joe Rogan in an interview that “everything that [Trump] thinks through is very practical and very common sense, and, you know, it's very logical.” According to Axios, Huang added that Trump \"wants to make sure that that the important, critical technology of our nation is built in United States, and that we re-industrialize and get good at manufacturing again, because it's important for jobs.\" It’s also worth remembering that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Oracle chairman Larry Ellison joined President Trump onstage in announcing Stargate — “the largest AI infrastructure project by far in history.” The two were joined by Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, who called the moment the “beginning of a golden age.” The next day, Altman posted on X that he believed Trump “will be incredible for the country in many ways!”\n\nEllison’s son David is the CEO of Skydance, and has infamously been rebuilding Paramount with Bari Weiss since the merger of Paramount Global and Skydance Media was approved this year. The list of major tech players bowing to Trump only grows from here, and putting the bulk of the transactions in one place should serve to remind us how closely tied Big Tech is with American (and global) politics.","summary":"Sure, we've seen millions poured into lobbying and other means of influence during every presidency, but the last two years set a whole new bar.

Last night, I informed @WWE talent relations that I would not be making any appearances for the company as long as this man remains in office. \n\n'Additionally, I will not be signing a new Legends deal when my current one expires in June. I love WWE, will always treasure my time with them, and I am deeply appreciative for all the opportunities they afforded me. \n\n'But, in the words of Popeye the sailor, 'I stands all I can stands, and I can't stands no more.'\n\nOn Tuesday, a source close to the investigation claimed to the Daily Mail that Reiner and his wife Michele were found in bed with their throats cut and may have been asleep when they were murdered.\n\nFoley, who was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013, has been a fixture of the company for decades, portraying characters Mankind, Cactus Jack and Dude Love. \n\nHowever, he has also been increasingly vocal about his political stances, frequently clashing with the wrestling giant's known support for the Trump administration. \n\nFoley was a contributor to Barack Obama's campaign for US presidency back in 2008 and also endorsed Kamala Harris for the 2024 presidential election.\n\nJust recently, he took to Instagram to heap praise on musician Jack White, who has also been a longstanding Trump critic, about his remarks against the president. \n\nWhite had shared a picture of Trump's comments on Reiner and labelled the president as 'disgusting, vile, egomaniac, loser, child'.\n\nSharing White's post, Foley said: 'What @officialjackwhite said here is spot on.\n\n'How any of my @wwe colleagues can stand by, let alone stand next to this man is beyond me'.\n\nFoley's decision comes in response to a series of attacks launched by President Trump against Reiner just hours after the director and his wife were found dead.\n\n'Well, I wasn't a fan of his at all. He was a deranged person. As far as Trump was concerned,' Trump told a reporter in the Oval Office on Monday.\n\n'I think he hurt himself, career-wise, he became like a deranged person, [with] Trump derangement syndrome. So I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way shape or form. I thought he was very bad for our country.'\n\nPrior to that, Trump had wrote that Reiner, a 'once very talented movie director and comedy star,' passed away, 'reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease' known as TDS - or Trump Derangement Syndrome. The term is used by conservatives to describe disdain for the Republican President.\n\nTrump's post continued: 'He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness.'\n\nThe vicious statement about the couple's death highlighted Trump's tendency to attack public figures following their passing. The Republican has also ridiculed the late Senator John McCain and General Colin Powell after they died. \n\nReiner famously supported liberal causes and Democratic candidates, even downplaying concerns over Joe Biden's age. 'Look, he's old!' the 78-year-old director explained in a February 2024 interview before Biden dropped out. \n\nReiner also loudly opposed Trump, calling him 'mentally unfit' and repeatedly claiming the Republican is an autocrat in interviews over the years. \n\n'Donald Trump is the single most unqualified human being to ever assume the presidency of the United States,' Reiner told Variety in a 2017 interview. \n\nThe couple's son Nick, 32, is in custody and has been booked for murder after Reiner and Michele were found knifed to death.\n\nThey allegedly had their throats slit after a heated argument with a relative, understood to be Nick, turned deadly at their $13.5 million Los Angeles mansion on Sunday afternoon.\n\nReiner made many of the best-known movies of the 1980s and 1990s, including Stand By Me and The Princess Bride, legal thriller A Few Good Men, and romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally.","summary":"Trump doubled down on his attacks on Reiner, after the Hollywood star and his wife were apparently murdered, and appeared to blame the killings on the liberal director's 'Trump Derangement Syndrome'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/wwe/article-15389407/mick-foley-cuts-ties-wwe-trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/16/16/104777827-0-image-m-20_1765902643275.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 19:18:47","author":"Editor,James Cohen","authors":["Editor","James Cohen"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.19},{"id":387320580,"title":"Jennifer Lopez laments over being misunderstood and reveals dream to become a director","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBlake Lively\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nU.K. Showbiz\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Dec 16th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRob Reiner's grieving family members seen for first time since director and wife's murder and son's arrest\n\nThe full story of Nick Reiner and these murders is so much more unbearable than everyone thinks.

Democratic state officials, overseeing one of the most generous welfare regimes in the country, are asleep at the switch. And the media, duty-bound by progressive pieties, refuse to connect the dots.”\n\nNow we know why the Democrat governor and the Democrats in power in the state didn’t stop it: They feared offending a “core voting bloc,” the Somalian immigrant community that was perpetrating the fraud.\n\nEvidence shows so far that just one of the frauds was the many child-care facilities set up by the community, and their subsequent claims to have distributed many, many more daycare services or meals than they actually did, inflating their government checks.\n\nEstimates that the schemes cost Minnesota taxpayers at least a billion dollars, much of which was sent by the Somali community back to Somalia, where it found its way into the checkbooks of al-Shabaab terrorists.\n\nAlready, the U.S. Treasury, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Housing and Urban Development are investigating.\n\nNow, an online organization has revealed U.S. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., reading a memo from that Democrat administration about why an investigation was not pursued.\n\n“Here’s what a fraud investigator in the [Minnesota] attorney general’s office said.

Tim Walz did enough to stop the fraud, according to a Monday KSTP and Survey USA poll.”\n\n“In total 92 percent of respondents identified the fraud as a problem. Of that 92 percent, 25 percent called it the biggest problem in the state, and 54 percent called it a major problem, and just 13 percent called it a minor problem. Sixty-nine percent of respondents said Walz needs to ‘do more’ to ‘stop fraud in Minnesota,'” the report said.\n\nAlready, prosecutors have charged dozens of fraudsters, and obtained dozens of convictions.\n\nIt came to light “after a group of mostly Somali immigrants set up a fraudulent charity, Feeding Our Future, and stole money from a federal child nutrition program. Federal investigations into the scheme, which have already led to 78 indictments, uncovered other similar Somali-related fraud schemes in Minnesota,” the Free Beacon reported.\n\nEgregious fraud in Minnesota has cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, including funds sent to Somalia through money services businesses (MSBs), which provide financial services outside a formal bank.\nUnder @POTUS’ leadership, the @USTreasury will not stop until we…\n— Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (@SecScottBessent) December 12, 2025\n\nNEW: The Department of Housing and Urban Development dispatched federal investigators to Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, to scrutinize federally funded aid programs amid revelations of a $1 billion welfare fraud scheme primarily involving Somali immigrants.\nA HUD… pic.twitter.com/I4NKDivuFR\n— Melissa Hallman (@dotconnectinga) December 15, 2025\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Stephen Miller has confirmed the welfare fraud scandal in Minnesota centered around Somali immigrants could make for the “greatest financial fraud” in the history of the United States.\n\nMiller charged that records show “90% of Somali households with children are on federal welfare. The real number is probably 100% because federal records always undercount. You’re talking about a population that has been imported into Minnesota in which virtually every single member of the population is receiving welfare from the federal government. This could very well end up, Laura, being the greatest financial fraud scandal in American history.”\n\nAlready, state employees have accused Gov. Tim Walz, who joined Kamala Harris on the Democrats’ failed 2024 presidential ticket, of engaging in “systemic” retaliation against whistleblowers who warned of the fraud schemes as the Justice Department prosecutes multiple federal cases.\n\nWalz, meanwhile, has promised to “welcome more” Somalians to his state.\n\nBREAKING: Dr. Oz says Minnesota Governor Tim Walz KNEW about the fraud but did nothing about it because the Somali community votes Democrat.

The lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida accused the BBC of interfering with the 2024 presidential election by airing an episode of “Panorama” featuring doctored video of Trump’s speech on Jan. 6, 2021, to make it appear he incited the riot at the Capitol building.\n\n“The Panorama Documentary falsely depicted President Trump telling supporters: ‘We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.’ (Falsely depicted at 33:53 of the Documentary),” the complaint says. “President Trump never uttered this sequence of words.”\n\nTelegraph associate editor Gordon Rayner broke down how the video was edited to present the appearance that Trump endorsed the riot in a video posted by the newspaper on YouTube Nov. 3, which was similar to a description of the events in the complaint.\n\n“Moreover, the BBC purposefully omitted President Trump stating, less than one minute after urging supporters to cheer for their senators and congressmen, ‘I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard’ (Remarks made on January 6, 2021, 12:13 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, 15:48 into the Speech),” the complaint states.\n\nThe BBC apologized to Trump on Nov. 13 in a letter from chairman Samir Shah after the two top BBC officials resigned following the Prescott dossier’s release, saying the program would not air again.\n\nTrump has won settlements from media outlets over their coverage of him. He secured a $15 million settlement with ABC in December 2024 after he sued the outlet on March 19, 2024, for defamation over “This Week” host George Stephanopoulos falsely saying Trump was found “liable for rape” during a contentious March 10, 2024, appearance by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina.\n\nParamount announced it had settled a $10 billion lawsuit filed by Trump over the editing of an October 2024 interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who was Trump’s opponent in the 2024 presidential election, on “60 Minutes” on July 2.\n\n“As we have made clear previously, we will be defending this case,” a BBC spokesperson told the Daily Caller News Foundation when the outlet was reached for comment. “We are not going to make further comment on ongoing legal proceedings.”\n\nThe White House referred the DCNF to outside counsel when reached for comment.

The BBC’s director-general and news CEO both stepped down last month. BBC chairman Samir Shah described the edit as an “error of judgment.”\n\nThe controversial documentary featured an edited clip of Trump telling rally-goers: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell, and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not gonna have a country anymore.”\n\nBut that clip was an edit of three different sections of Trump’s speech and cut out a nearly hour-long gap to make all that appear as one sentence. Among the portions left out was Trump’s plea to fight “peacefully.”\n\nAdditionally, the BBC documentary took footage of the Proud Boys en route to the Capitol before Trump’s address and made it appear that they were inspired to march over after his remarks at the White House Ellipse.\n\nTrump’s team is seeking a jury trial.\n\nThe BBC has countered that its documentary did not air in the US and is not on any of its streaming services. Trump’s team claims to have standing to sue because US subscribers to BritBox or Americans who use virtual private networks (VPNs) might have seen it.\n\nTrump has fired off lawsuits against multiple media outlets over recent months, such as the Wall Street Journal, over its publication of a birthday card it alleged he wrote to late sex predator Jeffrey Epstein, and a $15 billion suit against the New York Times over its coverage of his 2024 campaign. \n\nThe president enjoyed a lucrative $16 million settlement from CBS News over his lawsuit contending the outlet’s marquee “60 Minutes” program made an unfair edit of former Vice President Kamala Harris to improve her public image.\n\nThe president also notched a $15 million settlement with ABC News over his complaint that anchor George Stephanopoulos wrongly stated he was found liable for rape, when the jury in the E.

Trump sued the BBC for both defamation and for a violation of Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act for $5 billion apiece, as the president is seeking $10 billion total. The suit, filed in the Southern District of Florida Federal Court, was filed in a personal capacity and names BBC and BBC studios productions as defendants. \"The formerly respected and now disgraced BBC defamed President Trump by intentionally, maliciously, and deceptively doctoring his speech in a brazen attempt to interfere in the 2024 Presidential Election. The BBC has a long pattern of deceiving its audience in coverage of President Trump, all in service of its own leftist political agenda. President Trump’s powerhouse lawsuit is holding the BBC accountable for its defamation and reckless election interference just as he has held other fake news mainstream media responsible for their wrongdoing,\" a spokesperson for Trump’s legal team told Fox News Digital. Trump is represented by attorneys Alejandro Brito, Edward Paltzik and Daniel Epstein. The BBC has come under intense scrutiny over the documentary about Trump’s Jan. 6, 2021, speech delivered before the riot at the U.S. Capitol. Critics claim the documentary was wildly misleading because it omitted Trump's call for supporters to protest peacefully. The lawsuit states: \"The BBC, faced with overwhelming and justifiable outrage on both sides of the Atlantic, has publicly admitted its staggering breach of journalistic ethics, and apologized, but has made no showing of actual remorse for its wrongdoing nor meaningful institutional changes to prevent future journalistic abuses.\" The BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The BBC previously issued an apology for the erroneous edit and said it had pulled the program from its platforms, but a spokesperson for the broadcaster added, \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\" The controversy began with a bombshell report from The Telegraph that featured excerpts from a whistleblower dossier compiled by Michael Prescott, a communications advisor hired by the BBC to review its editorial standards. The whistleblower revealed that a BBC Panorama documentary released last year had a misleading edit of comments Trump made during a rally speech given on Jan. 6, 2021, as he protested the results of the 2020 presidential election. The documentary omitted Trump urging his supporters to protest \"peacefully\" and instead spliced two separate comments made nearly an hour apart, making him appear he was calling for violence. LEGAL ANALYST PREDICTS TRUMP COULD WIN 'CONSIDERABLE' DAMAGES FROM BBC DOCUMENTARY LAWSUIT \"We're gonna walk down to the Capitol. And I'll be there with you. And we fight — we fight like hell,\" the documentary showed Trump saying. In reality, Trump said, \"We're gonna walk down to the Capitol. And we're gonna cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong.\" It wasn't until 54 minutes later that Trump called on his supporters to \"fight like hell\" for election integrity. The New York Times referred to the ordeal as \"one of the worst crises in its 103-year history\" of the BBC. The blunder led to the resignations of BBC News CEO Deborah Turness and BBC director-general Tim Davie. The 46-page court filing states that the documentary \"has gained substantial traction and republication across various media in the United States and elsewhere globally\" and the BBC \"used their false and defamatory publications to maliciously disparage and damage President Trump and impugn his reputation.\" Trump’s legal team suggested the defendants \"timed the publication of the Panorama Documentary to be close in time to the 2024 Presidential Election\" and the value of the president’s \"personal brand alone is reasonably estimated to be worth tens of billions of dollars.\" \"Business ventures bearing his name generate hundreds of millions of dollars of annual revenue. Moreover, the injury to President Trump’s business and personal reputation inflicted by these Defendants, and their efforts to falsely, maliciously, and defamatorily portray President Trump as a violent insurrectionist, continue into the present, thereby causing massive economic damage to his brand value and significant damage and injury to his future financial prospects, in addition to continuing to harm his reputation as President of the United States of America,\" the suit states. Trump is seeking a jury trial. EX-BBC DIRECTOR GENERAL TELLS NETWORK THEY SHOULDN'T AGREE TO PAY TRUMP ANY MONEY Trump's lawsuit against the BBC is the latest in a string of legal battles he has had with news organizations. In December 2024, ABC News made a $16 million settlement with Trump and issued an apology after anchor George Stephanopoulos falsely claimed that Trump was found \"liable for rape\" in the president's civil court case against columnist E. Jean Carroll, when in fact, a New York jury found him liable for sexual abuse. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In July, Paramount made a multimillion-dollar settlement with Trump after he accused CBS News of \"election interference\" over its handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the lead-up to the 2024 election. While CBS News offered no apology or admitted to any wrongdoing, it did implement editorial reforms requiring the raw transcript of all presidential candidates to be released. Trump also reached settlements with Meta, X and YouTube (owned by Google) and has pending lawsuits against The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Des Moines Register and veteran pollster Ann Selzer.","summary":"The BBC has come under intense scrutiny over the documentary about President Trump’s Jan. 6, 2021, speech delivered before the attack on the U.S. Capitol.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-files-powerhouse-10-billion-lawsuit-against-bbc-over-documentary-editing-his-jan-6-remarks","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/11/trump-bbc-lawsuit-fox-news-2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-16 00:15:45","author":"Brian Flood,Joseph Wulfsohn","authors":["Brian Flood","Joseph Wulfsohn"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.191},{"id":387303730,"title":"Rob Reiner, his wife killed in apparent homicide - USA Today","text":"Rob Reiner, the acclaimed Hollywood director and actor, was killed alongside his wife, Michele Singer, in their California home, according to police.\n\nReiner and his wife were found dead in their Brentwood home Sunday afternoon, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell said in a Monday press conference.

They were dear friends, and Doug and I are devastated to learn of their passing.\"\n\nChristopher Guest, Jamie Lee Curtis are 'numb' over the loss of their 'great friends'\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, the actors said they \"are numb and sad and shocked about the violent, tragic deaths of our dear friends Rob and Michelle Singer Reiner and our ONLY focus and care right now is for their children and immediate families and we will offer all support possible to help them.\n\n \"There will be plenty of time later to discuss the creative lives we shared and the great political and social impact they both had on the entertainment industry, early childhood development, the fight for gay marriage and their global care for a world in crisis.\"\n\nThey closed their statement by simply saying, \"We have lost great friends. Please give us time to grieve.\"\n\nRob Reiner's family breaks silence on director's death\n\nAccording to CNN, a spokesperson for the Reiner family said late Sunday evening that the couple had died. They described their death as \"tragic\" and asked for privacy.\n\n\"It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nNo further details were given.\n\nNancy Pelosi mourns the death of Rob Reiner and his wife\n\nIn a post on X, Rep. Nancy Pelosi − whose husband was attacked in 2022 in their home − called the news of Reiner and his wife's death \"devastating.\"\n\n\"It's hard to think of anyone more remarkable and excellent in every field and endeavor they pursued,\" she said in a post to X. \"Rob was creative, funny, and beloved. And in all of their endeavors, Michelle was his indispensable partner, intellectual resource, and a loving wife.\"\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass paid tribute to the director\n\nThe California governor said he and his wife were \"heartbroken\" by the loss of Rob Reiner and Michele Singer.\n\n\"Rob was the big-hearted genius behind so many of the classic stories we love,\" he posted on X. \"His boundless empathy made his stories timeless, teaching generations how to see goodness and righteousness in others – and encouraging us to dream bigger.\"\n\nL.A. Mayor Bass called the loss \"devastating,\" posting on X that Rob Reiner \"improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice. An acclaimed actor, director, producer, writer, and engaged political activist, he always used his gifts in service of others. ... Among his numerous contributions, Rob helped create First 5 California, a landmark initiative funded by a tobacco tax to support early childhood development programs. He and Michele fought for early childhood development and marriage equality, working to overturn Proposition 8. They were true champions for LGBTQ+ rights.\"\n\nShe added, \"I want to thank all of the first responders who were called to this tragic event. The investigation is ongoing. I'm holding all who loved Rob and Michele in my heart.\"\n\nLAPD will continue investigating death of Rob Reiner, wife Michele\n\nIn a press conference on Sunday night, the LAPD said the robbery-homicide division will continue to investigate through the night and expects to release more information in the morning.\n\nThey announced they are not seeking anyone as a suspect or person of interest. But they added that no one has been detained at this time. Authorities did confirm that \"many family members\" will be interviewed in the course of their work and that they were obtaining a search warrant to conduct a full crime scene investigation.\n\nThey did not comment on the injuries sustained by the deceased.\n\nRob Reiner, wife Michele killed by their son Nick: report\n\nAccording to People, the couple was allegedly killed by their son, Nick Reiner, 32.\n\nUSA TODAY has not been able to independently confirm this information.\n\nThe New York Post also reported Nick was a person of interest in the case and ET also cited sources that he was allegedly involved.\n\nRob Reiner had been open about son's battle with addiction\n\nIn a 2016 interview with TODAY, the director spoke about the film \"Being Charlie,\" his most personal directorial effort yet. Co-written with Nick, the film traces a young man's descent into and out of drug addiction.\"Being Charlie,\" starring Nick Robinson, Common, Ricardo Chavira and Morgan Saylor screened at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival and was released on May 6, 2016. \n\n\"It was very personal,\" Reiner told TODAY at the time, adding that, \"What I didn't understand is the depth of what [Nick] was going through.\" \n\nThe film follows an 18-year-old Charlie who has been in and out of rehab for years.

Expel unassimilated foreigners? Teach Australian police to, I don't know, shoot back right away instead of standing around with their thumbs up their you-know-whats?\"\n\nNah. According to Albanese, what Australia really needs is more gun laws.\n\nThose poor, overworked gun laws — never accomplishing what sensible government and responsible citizens are supposed to do, and always called upon to do even more. \n\n\"People can be radicalized over a period of time,\" Albanese said to the press before Monday's cabinet meeting, without specifying which people. \"[Gun] licenses should not be in perpetuity.”\n\nRevoking a slip of paper from a terrorist... yeah, that ought to get a terrorist to turn in his rifle to the proper authorities.\n\nAustralia's gun laws are already among the strictest in the world, following the 1996 Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania. Automatic and most semiautomatic firearms and shotguns were banned under the National Firearms Agreement passed that year. The NFA based licensing on the premise that gun ownership is a privilege, not a right.\n\nLicenses are granted based on \"genuine reason,\" and self-defense is not among them. Applicants must jump through several hoops including genuine police checks, a 28-day cooling-off period, safety training, and secure storage mandates. Licenses are denied for criminal history, domestic violence, or mental health risks.\n\nOne of the gunman somehow cleared all those hoops, even though, as PJ Media's own Catherine Salgado reported on Sunday, \"was known to police before the attack, though allegedly not as an immediate threat.\"\n\nAnd Another Thing: Remember when lefties prattled on endlessly about addressing the \"root causes\" of crime so they could avoid addressing actual criminals? Now they don't even do that much, with the exception of that time Vice President Kamala Harris toured South America to study the root causes of illegal immigration so the Biden administration could avoid addressing the border they left wide open.\n\nCatherine also reported today that authorities also knew that one of the terrorists \"had ties to an ISIS terror cell.\" Like Catherine, I have trouble squaring that away with those same authorities dismissing any \"immediate threat.\"\n\nHow about a medium-term threat, mate? Is that soon enough?\n\nUnder current Australian gun laws, those \"genuine reasons\" for getting a gun license include recreational hunting, sport shooting, farming and pest control, or occupational needs. Which one of those did either of our terrorists qualify for?\n\nSo Australia has an ISIS cell in Sydney that they don't seem to know what to do with. They had a licensed gun-owner affiliated with that cell who wasn't seen as a threat. They had the police respond at first like Keystone Kops to terror-shooting target at legally disarmed Jews...\n\n...and the solution, of course, is more gun laws.\n\nRecommended: Everything Is Going to Hell — Cheer Up!","url":"https://pjmedia.com/vodkapundit/2025/12/15/ignoring-islamic-threat-aussie-pm-vows-tougher-gun-laws-after-bondi-beach-n4947095","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/349/7b57883e-fd66-42e4-86b2-6232489f22e3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 19:32:00","author":"Stephen Green","authors":["Stephen Green"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.386},{"id":387275340,"title":"The Guardian view on combating Europe’s national populists: protect the less well-off from the winds of change | Editorial","text":"More than a year after the election that handed Donald Trump a decisive comeback victory, the Democratic party has still not released its postmortem analysis.

The White House, as its recently published national security strategy makes clear, is hopeful that “patriotic” parties in Europe will soon replicate Mr Trump’s success. In the EU’s Franco-German engine room, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) and Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) lead the polls, backed by large swaths of blue-collar voters. But among mainstream leaders and parties, it is hard to discern a response that is adequate to troubling times.\n\nThe challenges Europe faces are expensive and era-defining. They include the war in Ukraine, maintaining the momentum of the green transition, addressing demographic change and developing economies that are less vulnerable to bullying by Mr Trump and China. According to the Brussels-based Breugel thinktank, the new age of geopolitical insecurity could require an additional €250bn in annual EU defence spending. Mario Draghi’s report last year on European economic competitiveness demanded massive investment in public goods and infrastructure, to be partly funded by jointly held EU debt.\n\nSuch a fiscal paradigm shift would boost growth figures that have flatlined for years. But at both the pan-European and national levels, there continues to be a lack of boldness when it comes to revenue raising. The EU’s so-called “frugal” nations oppose the idea of collective borrowing, and Brussels’ budget proposals for the next seven years are deeply unambitious. In France, the idea of a wealth tax on the super-rich is overwhelmingly popular with voters. But Emmanuel Macron’s beleaguered centrist government – though desperate to cut its budget deficit – refuses to contemplate such a move.\n\nThe reality is that in the absence of such measures, the less well-off will pay the price of financial adjustment through austerity budgets and greater inequality. Bitter recent disputes over pension cutbacks in both France and Germany testify to a developing struggle over the future of the European social model – a phenomenon that the RN and the AfD have happily exploited to promote a politics of welfare chauvinism. Ms Le Pen’s party, for example, has opposed moves to raise the retirement age and has said that it would target any benefit cuts at non-French nationals.\n\nIn the US, Mr Trump’s pledges to protect blue‑collar interests were deeply disingenuous, as subsequent Medicaid cuts and tax breaks for the wealthy underlined. But in the absence of a convincing progressive counteroffer from the Harris campaign, they worked on the campaign trail. Without a fundamental change in economic approach, social contracts across the continent risk being ripped up. Governments must avoid handing this political gift to the Trumpian forces already on the march in Europe.","summary":"As EU countries face multiple challenges in a new era, they must fight to preserve the continent’s social model.

Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness,” the president posted.\n\n– A beloved director –\n\nDemocratic politicians and Hollywood figures expressed shock over the deaths. \n\nFormer US vice president Kamala Harris was friends with the couple and said on X she was “devastated to learn of their passing,” while former president Barack Obama said he and his wife Michelle were “heartbroken.”\n\nReiner gave television and movie viewers “some of our most cherished stories on screen. But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people,” Obama said on X.\n\nMovie heavyweight John Cusack said he was “at a loss for any words that make sense” about the deaths.\n\nHorror and thriller writer Stephen King, whose novella “The Body” was the basis for Reiner’s 1986 coming-of-age classic “Stand By Me,” lauded a “wonderful friend.”\n\nReiner rose to acting fame as the oafish son-in-law Michael “Meathead” Stivic on groundbreaking 1970s sitcom “All in the Family,” before transitioning to directing. Even as a force behind the camera, he often appeared in cameo roles in his own films.\n\nHe directed the 1989 romantic comedy “When Harry Met Sally,” starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, and famously cast his real-life mother Estelle Reiner to utter the line “I’ll have what she’s having” after Ryan’s classic fake orgasm scene in Katz’s Delicatessen.\n\nHis 1992 thriller “A Few Good Men,” starring Hollywood heavyweights Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson, earned an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.\n\nReiner backed efforts to secure equal marriage rights for LGBTQ people and create California’s First 5 program, which provides child development programs funded by taxes on tobacco products.\n\nHe also helped fundraise for Democratic presidential candidates including Hillary Clinton.\n\nHe was the son of legendary comedian Carl Reiner, who won 11 Emmy Awards for his television performances and wrote screenplays with movie greats Mel Brooks and Neil Simon.","summary":"Hollywood director Rob Reiner and his wife were found dead in their Los Angeles home.

Gallego dejó atrás a algunos de sus colaboradores al buscar apoyo para una compañera demócrata que se postulaba a la alcaldía de la ciudad de mayoría hispana.\n\n“Mucho gusto”, dijo a los feligreses. “Soy Ruben Gallego, de Arizona”, dijo al presentarse sin mencionar que es senador federal.\n\nEl demócrata de Arizona se perfila como una figura crucial para un partido que busca desesperadamente recuperar el apoyo latino que se desvaneció en 2024 con la elección del presidente Donald Trump. Sus viajes en otoño incluyeron Nueva Jersey, Virginia y Florida, donde hizo campaña por los demócratas que posteriormente ganaron sus elecciones. Los estrategas dicen que Gallego demuestra su fuerza como estrella emergente del partido, a la vez que sienta las bases para una candidatura presidencial en 2028, a pesar de no ser tan conocido como Gavin Newsom, el gobernador de California, o Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, legisladora federal.\n\nEs un rol que se cree que Gallego mantendrá el próximo año, cuando los demócratas esperan poner fin al control republicano en el Congreso y contrarrestar la agenda de Trump.\n\n“Ruben Gallego va a ser nuestra arma secreta, no tan secreta”, dijo Maria Cardona, una operadora demócrata de larga trayectoria y miembro del Comité Nacional Demócrata.\n\nUna figura muy solicitada\n\nGallego se encuentra entre los demócratas nombrados como posibles contendientes para 2028 que tuvieron la agenda de viajes más apretada en 2025. Hizo campaña por las candidatas demócratas en las contiendas para el gobierno estatal de Nueva Jersey y Virginia, y para la alcaldía de Miami.\n\n“Ruben les brinda una validación instantánea, no sólo porque su apellido es Gallego”, dijo Chuck Rocha, quien movilizó a los latinos en la candidatura presidencial del senador Bernie Sanders, en 2020, y la de Gallego, en 2024. “Ha sacrificado su vida por su país, creció en un hogar de inmigrantes sin recursos, y ahora es senador federal. Ese es el tipo de persona que quieres a tu lado hablando con los latinos sobre por qué deberían votar por esta mujer blanca”.\n\nEn las elecciones presidenciales de 2024, Trump logró avances en zonas predominantemente puertorriqueñas del este de Pensilvania; transformó el valle del Río Grande, en el sur de Texas; y mejoró sus cifras a lo largo del corredor de la carretera Interestatal 4 de Florida. Lo hizo al centrarse con fuerza en la economía y la seguridad fronteriza.\n\nNo obstante, los resultados de las elecciones recientes han dado indicios de que grupos clave de votantes —incluidos los hispanos—, se alejan de los republicanos. Y en Miami, Eileen Higgins se convirtió en la primera persona demócrata en ser elegida para la alcaldía de la ciudad en casi 30 años.\n\n“Vamos a lugares donde hay una gran población latina”, dijo Gallego a The Associated Press en Miami. “Obviamente, se inclinaron demasiado por Trump la última vez, en nuestra opinión, y queremos hablar con los demócratas, y queremos hablar con los latinos y queremos hablar con los candidatos sobre cómo volver a tener a esa población en nuestra esquina”.\n\nEl propio Gallego superó a la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris en 2024, cuando ganó por más de 2 puntos un escaño en el Senado por Arizona y Trump se alzó con el triunfo en el estado por casi 6 puntos. Y reconoce el mérito del presidente republicano por sus medidas de seguridad fronteriza y, en ocasiones, elogia el estilo directo de Trump de no darle demasiadas vueltas a las propuestas económicas al elaborar su mensaje populista con ideas como “sin impuestos a las propinas”.\n\n“Necesitamos que nos identifiquen como alguien que apoya a la clase trabajadora”, expresó Gallego en un evento reciente.\n\nCómo la asequibilidad es personal\n\nGallego creció en la pobreza en Evergreen Park, un suburbio del área metropolitana de Chicago, y frecuentaba la zona de Little Village, un barrio predominantemente mexicano en el sudoeste de la ciudad.

Trump Library Foundation. \n\nPart of that headway was the state of Florida, somewhat controversially, giving Trump a parcel of land appraised at $60 million, but that real estate investors have said could be worth closer to $300 million. \n\nThe land, which had been used as a parking lot for Miami Dade College, is located next to the Freedom Tower, a recently restored landmark on Biscayne Boulevard that represents 'freedom of the press,' having formerly housed the Miami News. \n\nIt's also called the 'Ellis Island of the South,' as the building was used by the federal government to process Cuban refugees in the 1960s, fleeing Communism. \n\nBuilding a Trump library next door to the Freedom Tower has been met with opposition by some groups, who point to the president's hardline immigration policies. \n\nIncluding a 'fake news wing' in a high-rise adjacent to a press freedom monument could also ruffle some feathers. \n\nIt was conservative podcast host Benny Johnson, a former BuzzFeed News reporter who was fired for plagiarism, who gave Eric Trump the idea for a 'fake news wing.' \n\nJohnson pointed to the millions of dollars President Trump has received in settlements from media companies and suggested that those funds could be used to create the wing.\n\n'Please, for the love of God, make the fake news wing of the library sponsored by ABC News and CBS and 60 Minutes and put their logos right up there,' Johnson told Eric Trump during a podcast interview in late October. 'And just show everyone who paid for the fake news of the library.' \n\nEric Trump called Johnson's suggestion 'beautiful.' \n\nThe president's son suggested the wing would be a floor of the planned high-rise building, which Politico reported earlier this month could stretch to 47 stories, as Trump is the 45th and 47th president.\n\nThe high-rise could also include a hotel, restaurant and office space, making it stand out from other presidential library projects. \n\nEric Trump said 'fake news' exhibits could include former Vice President Kamala Harris' 60 Minutes interview played on repeat, which Trump's team claimed was deceptively edited ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nCBS said Harris' interview was edited for time, as is customary for most taped television interviews. \n\nStill, Paramount, CBS' parent company, paid Trump a $16 million settlement in July, as the company was trying to finalize an $8 billion sale to Skydance Media, which Trump's FCC approved. \n\nThe settlement was paid specifically to the Trump Library Foundation. \n\nEric Trump also suggested there be an exhibit on Charlottesville, arguing that his father's 'very fine people on both sides' comments got twisted by the mainstream media.\n\n'We can remind people who all these people are,' he continued. 'The fact that Stephanopoulos literally ran the Clinton war room but now they have to fairly moderate debates,' Eric Trump said.\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos worked in President Bill Clinton's White House before working for ABC News. \n\n'I will do an entire floor dedicated to the fake news, and I'll have a little trademark in your honor, Benny,' Eric Trump told Johnson.","summary":"President Donald Trump could include a 'fake news wing' as part of his high-rise presidential library that he wants to build in downtown Miami.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15385535/donald-trump-presidential-library-fake-news-wing.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/15/17/104742463-0-image-m-13_1765818327336.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 18:47:20","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":387311042,"title":"HUD joins other federal authorities investigating $1 billion fraud in Minnesota’s Somali community","text":"The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development has joined U.S. Treasury, U.S. Customs and Immigration and other federal authorities investigating what apparently is a massive fraud scheme in the Somali community that has established itself in Minnesota, and has cost American taxpayers a billion dollars or more.\n\nA recent City Journal investigation found that fraud in the Somali immigrant community in Minnesota was taking hundreds of millions, even billions, of dollars from taxpayers, and much of it was going to Somalia, where it was delivered into the hands of al-Shabaab terrorists.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, whose investigators already were looking into the scandal, recently confirmed the organizations that shift money from one part of the world to another, from the U.S. to Somalia, for example, are being investigated.\n\nEgregious fraud in Minnesota has cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, including funds sent to Somalia through money services businesses (MSBs), which provide financial services outside a formal bank.\nUnder @POTUS’ leadership, the @USTreasury will not stop until we…\n— Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (@SecScottBessent) December 12, 2025\n\nNow a report at the Washington Examiner confirms the Department of Housing and Urban Development is joining the project.\n\nIt has sent federal investigators to Minnesota, mainly St. Paul and Minneapolis where resides a huge, as in tens of thousands, community of Somali immigrants.\n\nHUD officials said, in the report, the agency is putting Minnesota “on notice, that we are taking enforcement and fiscal oversight seriously given the rampant fraud.”\n\nThe review will include a look, by officials at its headquarters, of money that has gone through Minnesota’s public housing authorities, in order to make certain there is no fraud going on in federal housing aid.\n\nThe report said the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority spends $108 million annually on housing choice vouchers and public housing, while St. Paul spends $46 million.\n\nThe report explained the main scandal involves Feeding Our Future, a nonprofit group that claims it gave millions of meals to children during the pandemic, and cashed in on payments of $300 million.\n\nAnd HUD Secretary Scott Turner has revealed the department has cut funding for Somalis who have temporary protected status.

Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead Sunday in their Los Angeles home in what police described as an apparent homicide. Police said Monday that their son Nick Reiner has been arrested on murder charges.With a career that spanned multiple genres over more than five decades, Rob Reiner is considered a legend by many in the film and television industry. He rose to fame as a comedic actor in the CBS sitcom \"All in the Family,\" and his directing credits include classic titles like \"A Few Good Men,\" \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally...\" and \"This is Spinal Tap.\"Stephen King said he was \"horrified and saddened\" by the news of the Reiners' deaths in a post shared on X. Reiner's coming-of-age drama \"Stand by Me\" was based on King's novella \"The Body,\" and he also went on to direct the 1990 screen adaptation of the author's thriller \"Misery,\" both of which won acclaim. \"Wonderful friend, political ally, and brilliant filmmaker,\" King said. \"Rest in peace, Rob. You always stood by me.\"The actor and television host Jerry O'Connell, who was one of the young co-stars in \"Stand By Me,\" shared an photo on Instagram of himself and Reiner on the set of the 1986 movie. In its caption, he wrote: \"Love you Rob. Sincerely.\"In an interview on \"CBS Mornings,\" O'Connell described Reiner's death as \"surreal\" and reflected on the formative role that Reiner played in his life. \"Rob was like a father to me,\" he said. \"Everything I have is because of Rob Reiner. ... It's just a sad, shocking day.\"\"What a huge loss,\" wrote Ben Stiller, who said Reiner was one of his favorite directors and praised his \"incredible run of movies.\"\"He made some of the most formative movies for my generation,\" Stiller posted on X. \"'Spinal Tap' is one of the best comedies ever made — and the list goes on. He was a kind caring person who was really really funny. I didn't know him well but was always a fan and I feel a real sadness for those who did, and his family.\"\"Thank you Rob for giving us so much joy to hold on to. Life and talent always turned up to 11,\" actor Virginia Madsen, who appeared in Reiner's 1996 film \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" wrote on Instagram. James Woods, who starred in the same film, said in a post on X that Reiner had fought for him to play that part, and they \"remained good friends ever since.\"Actor Josh Gad called Reiner \"one of the greatest directors of our time.\" His Instagram post included several photos of them together.\"He was a friend. He was simply a beautiful person,\" Gad captioned it. \"Rob Reiner and his wife Michelle were two of the most kind and caring souls you could ever imagine. He cared so much for those who had no voices. This loss is devastating. I cannot express how much this hurts. Love you Rob and Michelle. Thank you for all you gave us.\"Fellow director Joe Russo said he \"can't handle the truth that one of the greatest filmmakers to ever live is gone\" in a post on X, referencing the iconic line from \"A Few Good Men.\"\"We lost one of the few good men. RIP, Rob Reiner,\" Russo added.Actor and Screen Actors Guild president Sean Astin said in a news release that Reiner was \"one of those most significant figures in the history of film and television,\" whose cultural influence \"simply can't be overstated.\"\"All in the Family\" creator Norman Lear, who died in 2023 at age 101, \"often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary,\" Lear's family said in a statement. The family said they were \"devastated by the deaths of Rob and Michele Reiner.\"\"Norman would have wanted to remind us that Rob and Michele spent every breath trying to make this country a better place, and they pursued that through their art, their activism, their philanthropy, and their love for family and friends,\" the family said.Politicians from California and beyond have spoken out to express their condolences and celebrate Reiner's accomplishments in cinema as well as political activism. Reiner was a vocal advocate for Democratic campaigns and, in California, led initiatives for LGBTQ rights and early childhood development.Former Vice President Kamala Harris said Reiner and his wife \"were dear friends,\" and Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, \"are devastated to learn of their passing.\" Harris, who previously represented California in the U.S. Senate, said Reiner's work \"has impacted generations of Americans.\" \"The characters, dialogue, and visuals he brought to life in film and television are woven throughout our culture,\" Harris wrote on X. \"Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America's democracy.\" Former House Speaker and current Rep. Nancy Pelosi, of California, described Reiner as \"creative, funny, and beloved\" and said in a statement that she and her family were mourning \"the loss of our very dear friends.\"California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement that he's \"heartbroken by the tragic loss of Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner,\" while Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the Reiners' deaths \"a devastating loss for our city and our country.\"\"Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,\" Bass said in a statement.Former President Barack Obama also shared a statement on X, saying, \"Rob's achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen. But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people—and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action.

One year into his second presidency Trump is facing possibly his most brutal midterms beatdown yet, as economic conditions have complicated his ability to tout the success of his tariff agenda and issues such as the Jeffrey Epstein investigation have allowed Democrats and even his own conservative critics to paint him as increasingly out of touch with regular Americans.\n\nBut there are other parts of the MAGA coalition whose support Trump can seek to turn out even as he works to repair his image among swing voters who backed him over Kamala Harris. Those working class, often rural voters who joined the Trump train in 2016 and swung parts of battleground states such as Pennsylvania to the reddest they’d been in decades could still bolster the MAGA coalition next year. The problem? Experience proves that those voters don’t typically turn out for Republicans unless Trump is on the ballot, too.\n\nEnter the president’s midterm strategy: Near-weekly rallies, two White House insiders told The Washington Post, throughout 2026 to energize the MAGA coalition to the levels of excitement and fervor currently felt by many of the president’s opponents.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles, one of the key minds behind Trump’s 2024 return to power, hinted at the strategy in a podcast interview this month.\n\n\"I haven't quite broken it to him yet, but he's going to campaign like it's 2024 again,” Wiles said on a show run by the right-wing group Moms for America.\n\n“Typically, in the midterms, it’s not about who's sitting at the White House; you localize the election. And you keep the federal officials out of it. We’re actually going to turn that on its head and put him on the ballot,” she continued.\n\nWhile some are questioning the GOP’s strategy for winning an election on behalf of a party whose president is recovering from some of his worst approval ratings ever, it could work in the party’s overall favor. Generating support among low-propensity members of the MAGA coalition may seem to the White House to be Trump’s best option, given the bleeding occurring among his strongest supporters. \n\nThe strategy could be key to saving Senate seats for his party in states such as Ohio, North Carolina and Georgia, which Trump won last year but are the sites of three pitched battles that could decide the upper chamber’s majority next year.\n\nAt the same time, it could put frontline House Republican members in a tight spot. Republicans have been warning for months that members in states such as New York, California and purple states across the country are in danger if the president doesn’t course-correct and refocus on an economic agenda that addresses cost of living issues that are now ranked No. 1 in importance for millions of people. \n\nThe Post reported that advisers including Mark Mitchell of Rasmussen Reports have made this argument to Trump personally in recent days.\n\n“To the extent to which we were talking about the economic populism message, he wasn’t as interested as I would have hoped,” Mitchell told the paper.\n\nIn the months immediately ahead, the president’s ability to reform his coalition will likely be decided on two main economic factors: His ability to address cost of living, including grocery, energy and housing prices, and the broader Republican Party’s bid to address an imminent spike in health care premiums for millions of Americans who purchase insurance plans from the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) public exchanges.\n\nSubsidies passed as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act expire at the end of the month, and twin Republican majorities in the House and Senate are scrambling to come up with a plan that can win enough support from the factional House GOP majority as well as win enough Democratic votes to pass the Senate, where it will need votes from seven Democrats to pass the 60-vote filibuster threshold.\n\nThose imminent premium spikes could be the nail in the coffin for Trump’s efforts to repair his image among both low-income and middle-income voters, many of whom will be priced out of their plans entirely as annual costs are expected to double or more in January.","summary":"White House chief of staff says Trump will try and rally his MAGA base to do what it has never done before: Deliver Republicans a midterm wave, John Bowden writes.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-rallies-midterms-2026-republicans-b2884917.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/10/0/58/SEI277467341.jpg?crop=5733,3822,x0.5,y0&trim=0,1,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xZ0rVfjz-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-15 17:22:28","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.041},{"id":387289472,"title":"Son arrested after Rob Reiner and wife found dead: U.S. media","text":"Police took Rob Reiner’s son into custody after the Hollywood director of hits including “When Harry Met Sally” and his wife were found dead in their Los Angeles home, U.S. media reported on Monday (December 15, 2025). \n\nNetworks CBS and ABC said Nick Reiner was arrested, and the Los Angeles Times reported he was booked into the Los Angeles County jail on suspicion of murder, citing jail records. \n\nLos Angeles deputy police chief Alan Hamilton had said earlier they were seeking to interview “every family member” of the 78-year-old actor-director and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner. \n\nThe bodies were discovered on Sunday (December 14) and police said they were treating the case as an “apparent homicide.” \n\nAs tributes poured in for Reiner, Donald Trump unleashed a crude broadside on the Hollywood icon, appearing to blame the deaths on the director’s “raging” criticism of the U.S. President. \n\nSeveral U.S. news media cited police sources as saying the couple were stabbed, while celebrity news website TMZ, which first broke the story, reported that their throats had been cut by a family member during an argument. \n\nReiner directed classic films including 1984’s rock music mockumentary “This is Spinal Tap,” fantasy gem “The Princess Bride” from 1987, and the 1992 courtroom drama “A Few Good Men.” \n\nHis films spanned everything from laugh-out-loud comedy to searing drama and earned him a global following. \n\nReiner was politically active and an outspoken supporter of progressive causes — potentially a reason for the extraordinary statement by Mr. Trump on Monday (December 15), less than a day after the killings. \n\nWhile movie fans around the world grieved, Mr. Trump claimed Reiner died “reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.” \n\n“He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness,” the President posted. \n\nA beloved director \n\nDemocratic politicians and Hollywood figures expressed shock over the deaths. \n\nFormer U.S. vice-president Kamala Harris was friends with the couple and said on X she was “devastated to learn of their passing,” while former president Barack Obama said he and his wife Michelle were “heartbroken.” \n\nReiner gave television and movie viewers “some of our most cherished stories on screen. But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people,” Mr. Obama said on X. \n\nMovie heavyweight John Cusack said he was “at a loss for any words that make sense” about the deaths. \n\nHorror and thriller writer Stephen King, whose novella “The Body” was the basis for Reiner’s 1986 coming-of-age classic “Stand By Me,” lauded a “wonderful friend.” \n\nReiner rose to acting fame as the oafish son-in-law Michael “Meathead” Stivic on groundbreaking 1970s sitcom “All in the Family,” before transitioning to directing. Even as a force behind the camera, he often appeared in cameo roles in his own films. \n\nHe directed the 1989 romantic comedy “When Harry Met Sally,” starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, and famously cast his real-life mother Estelle Reiner to utter the line “I’ll have what she’s having” after Ryan’s classic fake orgasm scene in Katz’s Delicatessen. \n\nHis 1992 thriller “A Few Good Men,” starring Hollywood heavyweights Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson, earned an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. \n\nReiner backed efforts to secure equal marriage rights for LGBTQ people and create California’s First 5 program, which provides child development programs funded by taxes on tobacco products. \n\nHe also helped fundraise for Democratic presidential candidates including Hillary Clinton. \n\nHe was the son of legendary comedian Carl Reiner, who won 11 Emmy Awards for his television performances and wrote screenplays with movie greats Mel Brooks and Neil Simon.","summary":"Reiner was politically active and an outspoken supporter of progressive causes — potentially a reason for the extraordinary statement by Donald Trump on Monday (December 15), less than a day after the killings","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/son-arrested-after-rob-reiner-and-wife-found-dead-us-media/article70400277.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/imlz50/article70400301.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-12-15T163154Z_1843222209_RC24HIAK0UMT_RTRMADP_3_PEOPLE-ROB-REINER.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 16:51:21","author":"Donald Trump","authors":["Donald Trump"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.125},{"id":387229566,"title":"Pelosi reveals she and Biden still haven't spoken, rejects premise that she told him to drop out","text":"Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi revealed in an interview released Saturday that she and former President Joe Biden still have not spoken after she played a role in encouraging him to drop out of the 2024 election. USA Today's Susan Page asked Pelosi about her involvement in Biden’s decision to exit the race during an interview on \"The Excerpt\" podcast and whether she has spoken to the former president since. \"No, but I want to just recharacterize what you said. My conversations with the president were more about let's make sure we're understanding what the polls say, and there are certain attitudes that the public had, had they been taken into consideration. If they had sat down with more pollsters, it might have come to a place where we said, ‘This is it, the president should go,’ but they just decided that their polls were right and that was that. So I didn't go in there to say to the president, 'You shouldn't run.' I said, ‘We've got to compare polls because we have different numbers,'\" Pelosi said.

PELOSI DEMURS ON IF ‘EVERYTHING IS OK’ BETWEEN HER AND BIDEN: ‘YOU’D HAVE TO ASK HIM' \"Well, I'm saddened by it because I love him and respect him, but I respect his decision in that regard,\" Pelosi said. Pelosi joined MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" in July 2024 following the former president's disastrous debate performance and said, \"It’s up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" suggesting that Biden was still weighing his options despite insisting at the time he would remain in the race. Reports at the time said Pelosi and other Democratic leaders were working behind the scenes to persuade Biden to drop out, as Pelosi was reportedly convinced he would lose to then-President Donald Trump.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrats' 2024 standard-bearer after then-President Joe Biden exited the race, showcased an edgier stump speech as she railed against both major parties and the political status quo in an address at the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) winter meeting this past weekend. And California Gov. Gavin Newsom landed the red carpet treatment, as he mingled with delegates during the opening day of the DNC's confab, which was held this year in Los Angeles, home turf to both Harris and Newsom. The main focus for the hundreds of committee members and party officials who attended the summit was reviewing the party's decisive victories in last month's 2025 elections and better than expected performances in this year's special elections, and training sessions to prepare for next year's crucial midterm contests. 21 DEMOCRATS WHO MAY RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2028 But with the unofficial start of the next White House race less than a year away, and what's likely to be a bruising battle among Democrats over the party's presidential nominating calendar getting underway, 2028 was also in the spotlight. \"Obviously, we must focus on the midterms,\" Harris said in her Friday speech. \"But Democrats, we must also have a clear vision for what comes after the midterms. And then after Trump. We need to answer the question. We need to answer the question: what comes next for our party and our democracy?\" Harris argued that \"both parties have failed to hold the public's trust\" and that \"people are done with the status quo, and they're ready to break things to force change.\" 2028 LOOMS LARGE: HARRIS, NEWSOM, PRITZKER CONVERGE AT MAJOR DNC MEETING And Harris, who was swept by President Donald Trump in all key battleground states in the 2024 election, said that Trump is representative of a bigger problem plaguing the nation's politics. \"He and the rise of the MAGA movement, I believe, are a symptom of a failed system that is the result of years of outsourcing and offshoring, financial deregulation, growing income inequality, a broken campaign finance system and endless partisan gridlock all contributing to how we got here today,\" she emphasized. \"The vice president received a very warm and enthusiastic reception,\" a committee member told Fox News Digital. And when she alluded to who would be in contention for the 2028 nomination, some in the room shouted, \"You.\" According to those in the room, Harris also landed a warm welcome less than 24 hours earlier as she spoke at the United Farm Workers annual gala. Expect to see more of Harris in the new year, helping Democrats from coast to coast as the party works to win back congressional majorities in the midterms. And Harris has added more 2026 stops to her book tour promoting \"107 Days,\" her reflections on her abbreviated 2024 presidential campaign. Among the stops is one in South Carolina, a crucial early-voting primary state in the Democratic Party's presidential nominating calendar. SUCCEEDING TRUMP IN 2028: SIX REPUBLICANS TO KEEP YOUR EYES ON While Newsom didn't address the delegates at Friday's general session, he was treated like a VIP on Thursday as he held meetings and mingled with delegates during the opening day of the winter meeting. A DNC committee member who witnessed the commotion told Fox News Digital, \"Newsom received a rock star reception as he was mobbed by party leaders and activists alike while he attempted to walk from meeting to meeting.\" Newsom on Thursday met with the Democratic Party chairs from New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state, and Nevada, another crucial early voting state. \"We had a great discussion on a wide range of issues,\" longtime New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley told Fox News Digital. Newsom's stature in his own party has soared this year, thanks to his very vocal and visual pushback against the president, including his viral social media trolling of Trump and his successful California push to counter the Republican congressional redistricting effort. \"Newsom has shown an ability to stand up to Trump in a bold and highly effective manner without shying away from core democratic values,\" veteran Democratic strategist Joe Caiazzo told Fox News Digital. While both Newsom and Harris made a splash at the DNC winter meeting, they both have plenty of detractors who worry that neither would be electable in 2028 when the Democrats try to win back the White House. And if one or both of them launch presidential campaigns, they'll likely be joined by a large crowd of other contenders. One of those possible White House hopefuls is Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who was also making the rounds during the opening day of the DNC meeting. Fox News Digital confirmed that the billionaire governor helped raise over $1 million for the DNC at a fundraiser Thursday night. A DNC insider said the appearances by Harris, Newsom and Pritzker gave \"them an opportunity to start honing in on a winning message for Democrats in 2028.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP There are more than a dozen other Democrats thought to be potential 2028 White House contenders. And most of them have also been paying visits to the early voting states, as well as parachuting onto the 2025 campaign trail. Among them are Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Wes Moore of Maryland and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan; Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Ruben Gallego and Mark Kelly of Arizona, and Chris Murphy of Connecticut; progressive superstar Rep.

On his social media platform of choice, Trump sent insincere condolences while furthering his own agenda, positioning himself as a victim. “A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood. Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS,” Trump wrote. “He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before. May Rob and Michele rest in peace!”\nHowever, the director has received several sincere tributes from friends and past collaborators. Guest and his wife, Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis, released a statement about the Reiners: “Christopher and I are numb and sad and shocked about the violent, tragic deaths of our dear friends Rob and Michele Singer Reiner and our ONLY focus and care right now is for their children and immediate families, and we will offer all support possible to help them,” it read. “There will be plenty of time later to discuss the creative lives we shared and the great political and social impact they both had on the entertainment industry, early childhood development, the fight for gay marriage, and their global care for a world in crisis. We have lost great friends. Please give us time to grieve.”\nThe son of comedy legend Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner began his long and varied career in Hollywood as an actor, winning two Primetime Emmys for his role as Meathead (a.k.a. Michael) on Lear’s classic sitcom All in the Family. In the 1980s, Reiner would focus his sights on directing; his first film was the mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, starring himself, Guest, Harry Shearer, and Michael McKean. Reiner went on to direct a string of critically acclaimed, widely beloved films in a number of genres: coming-of-age (Stand by Me, 1986); fantasy-adventure (The Princess Bride, 1987); romantic comedy (When Harry Met Sally…, 1989); psychological horror (Misery, 1990); and courtroom drama (A Few Good Men, 1992).\nStars of the late filmmaker’s past projects came out in droves to honor him. Elwes, Reiner’s Princess Bride star, posted on Instagram a photo showing two director’s chairs on the set of the movie. “No words,” Elwes wrote in the caption. Jerry O’Connell, who starred in Reiner’s Stand by Me as a child, posted a photo on X of himself and Reiner on the set of that film, adding the simple caption, “Love you, Rob. Sincerely.” Elijah Wood, who starred in Reiner’s much-maligned 1994 film, North, wrote on X that he was “horrified to hear of the passing of Rob Reiner and his wonderful wife Michelle [sic]. So much love to their kids and family.” John Cusack, who starred in Reiner’s 1985 film, The Sure Thing, wrote on X, “Shocked by the death of Rob Reiner - a great man,” while Virginia Madsen, who starred in his 1996 drama, Ghosts of Mississippi, paid tribute to Reiner on Instagram, posting a photo of the two together. “Thank you Rob for giving us so much joy to hold on to. Life and talent always turned up to 11,” she wrote.\nIt wasn’t just former collaborators who paid tribute to Reiner and his wife. Ben Stiller—who, like Reiner, had a famously funny father (that would be Jerry Stiller)—paid tribute to Reiner on X. Although Stiller said he “didn’t know him well,” he expressed “what a huge loss” Reiner’s death was for the entertainment industry.\n“Rob Reiner was one of my favorite directors. He made some of the most formative movies for my generation,” Stiller wrote. “He came out form [sic] behind a huge comedic shadow of the great Carl Reiner and being a tv actor to being a great director who made an incredible run of movies. Spinal Tap is one of the best comedies ever made - and the list goes on. He was a kind caring person who was really really funny.” Bridesmaids director Paul Feig posted a photo of himself with Reiner at Comic-Con in San Diego, saying it was one of his “most cherished pictures.”\n“Rob was my true hero,” Feig continued. “A true visionary titan and a lovely lovely person. One never knows if it’s proper to post during something as tragic as this. But I just want the world to know what so many of us know in the industry. Rob was the best.”\nFellow sitcom actor turned director Ron Howard also expressed his condolences on X. “Our careers and lives intersected often over the decades from Rob writing the pilot script for Happy Days and then as we each shifted from acting careers into directing and producing,” Howard wrote. “He proved to be a superlative filmmaker, a supportive colleague and at all times a dedicated citizen. Rob will be missed on so many levels. My heart goes out to his family and his many close friends.”\nAs Trump was well aware, Reiner was a vocal Democrat—and as such, prominent figures in the Democratic Party have also expressed their condolences. On X, former president Barack Obama wrote that he and Michelle were “heartbroken by the tragic passing” of the Reiners. “Rob’s achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen,” he continued. “But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people—and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action.”\nFormer Speaker of the House and current California congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said she was devastated by the “deadly assault” against Reiner and his wife. “Rob cared deeply about people and demonstrated that in his civic activities — whether by supporting the First 5 initiative or fighting against Prop 8 in California,” she shared on X. “Civically, he was a champion for the First Amendment and the creative rights of artists.” Former vice president and California senator Kamala Harris also expressed her condolences to the “loved ones” of her “dear friends” the Reiners. “Rob Reiner’s work has impacted generations of Americans. The characters, dialogue, and visuals he brought to life in film and television are woven throughout our culture,” she wrote on X. “Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America’s democracy.”\nLegendary producer Norman Lear, who created All in the Family and, in the process, gave Reiner his breakthrough role, died at the age of 101 in 2023. Still, his estate released a heartfelt statement on the occasion of Reiner’s death. “The Lear family is devastated by the deaths of Rob and Michele Reiner,” began the statement. “Norman often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary, to us and the world. Norman would have wanted to remind us that Rob and Michele spent every breath trying to make this country a better place, and they pursued that through their art, their activism, their philanthropy, and their love for family and friends. Lyn Lear had remained very close with them and said, ‘The world is unmistakably darker tonight, and we are left bereft.’”","summary":"After Rob Reiner and his wife Michele’s sudden, tragic deaths, celebrities and politicians are posting remembrances of the late filmmaker—while President Trump offers snide condolences to a liberal afflicted with “TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.”","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/rob-and-michele-reiner-remembered-hollywood-pays-tribute-to-their-dear-friends","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69402b4d5eb7a1a578dbb360/16:9/w_2256,h_1269,c_limit/450937953","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 15:40:23","author":"Chris Murphy","authors":["Chris Murphy"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.358},{"id":387216936,"title":"Hollywood Director Rob Reiner, Wife’s Deaths Investigated As Homicide","text":"Police were conducting a homicide investigation Monday after Hollywood giant Rob Reiner — director of a string of hits including “When Harry Met Sally” — and his wife, Michele Reiner, were found dead in their Los Angeles home.\n\nAs tributes poured in for Reiner, 78, Los Angeles deputy police chief Alan Hamilton said they were seeking to interview “every family member” of the actor-director and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner.\n\nThe bodies were discovered Sunday, and police said they were treating the case as an “apparent homicide.”\n\nREAD ALSO: Saudi Sets New Death Penalty Record After Executing 340 In 2025\n\nSeveral US news media cited police sources as saying the couple were stabbed, while celebrity news website TMZ, which first broke the story, reported Monday that their throats had been cut by a family member during an argument.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that a source with knowledge of the investigation said there was no sign of forced entry into the home.\n\nHamilton said no arrests have been made and did not publicly identify any potential suspect or even person of interest.\n\n“I’m not going to confirm whether someone’s being interviewed at this time or not.

Fox News Digital has reached out to several members of the Biden administration with roles directly or tangentially related to the Afghanistan withdrawal and the resettlement of Afghan refugees. SENATOR RENEWS PUSH TO MANDATE VETTING FOR AFGHAN EVACUEES AFTER NATIONAL GUARD SHOOTING Inquiries to former President Joe Biden’s office, former Vice President Kamala Harris and a second request to an individual listed as Harris’ literary agent were not returned within a week. Messages sent to former Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley [Ret.], as well as via an official at the Princeton University School of Public and International Affairs – where he is listed as a visiting professor – also went unanswered. Milley, though a general, was not in a command position – as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is an advisory role. In that regard, he did not make any operational decisions, but instead was in the president's ear when it came to military advice. Milley later told senators on Capitol Hill that he recommended maintaining a small, 2,500-troop force in Afghanistan. Fox News Digital also reached out to former Central Command (CENTCOM) commander, Gen. Kenneth \"Frank\" McKenzie via his new role at the University of South Florida, for comment – which was not returned.

Finer is now a visiting fellow at Columbia University’s School of Public and International Affairs, and Sullivan’s wife – Rep. Maggie Goodlander, D-N.H., is in her first term in Congress. Sullivan was a key adviser to Biden during the withdrawal and was later pressed by CNN whether he feels \"personally responsible for the failures\" therein. He replied that the \"strategic call President Biden made, looking back three years, history has judged well and will continue to judge well. From the point of view that, if we were still in Afghanistan today, Americans would be fighting and dying; Russia would have more leverage over us; we would be less able to respond to the major strategic challenges we face.\" A woman who answered a line listed for former Secretary of State Antony Blinken redirected Fox News Digital to a press liaison. That request was not returned. Blinken, as leader of the State Department, was the point person for the diplomatic aspect of the withdrawal. He advised Biden on what to do about the Taliban's \"Doha Agreement\" that was forged by the previous Trump administration, while the department coordinated overflight rights, temporary housing and other issues regarding the refugee outflow from Kabul. SENATE REPUBLICANS LAUNCH INVESTIGATION INTO BIDEN IMMIGRATION PROGRAMS AFTER DC NATIONAL GUARD SHOOTING A woman who answered an extension listed for former Pentagon chief Gen. Lloyd Austin III [Ret.] said she would take a message and that Austin would return the call if he wished.

DHS officials ultimately cut his access to the agency’s social media accounts, according to the paper, and a report from Heritage Foundation fellow Simon Hankinson cited that he ultimately left the job soon after. His role would have also placed him in the midst of the orchestration of Operation Allies Welcome and Operation Allies Refuge. He was also unable to be reached for comment.

We send love and warmth to Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner’s families, friends and colleagues. Our entertainment community and audiences around the world will mourn deeply.\n\nOn a personal note, so many of Mr Reiner’s films and performances made me think, made me emotional and especially they made me laugh really hard.

Now, many feel they can't afford it.","text":"FEASTERVILLE, Pa. — Fishing through his wallet, David Teeling pulls out a wrinkled newspaper clip showing Donald Trump working the drive-thru of a local McDonald's — this McDonald’s, the very same one where he and a few friends routinely meet to talk politics and sports. Teeling keeps the picture as verifiable proof for those who don’t believe him when he explains what happened: The once and future president turned up in suburban Philadelphia toward the end of the 2024 campaign and scooped French fries for the customers pulling up to the window. “Some people believe me and some don’t, so I keep that,” says Teeling, 70, over a cup of coffee. A year ago, Trump visited this site to make the point that he was attuned to everyday people who felt overlooked in the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris economy. These days, it’s Trump who’s in danger of appearing out of touch. Ahead of midterm elections next year, voters are feeling squeezed by high prices and blaming Trump for not doing enough to ease the cost of living, polling shows. A new NBC News Decision Desk survey shows that 53% of adults have changed their grocery-buying habits to stay within budget, while 55% have cut back on entertainment and “extras” so that they can afford life’s necessities. A sampling of grocery prices shows the price of eggs has dropped 29% since Trump was sworn in, though beef prices are up nearly 13%, chicken prices are up 2% and bread is up 4%. Orange juice prices have climbed 28% since the start of Trump's term, according to Nieslen IQ data in the NBC News grocery price tracker. Overall, an AP-NORC poll found that just 31% of adults approved of Trump’s handling of the economy, the lowest rating he’s notched in either his first or second term. “We can improve those numbers,” John McLaughlin, a Trump pollster, said in an interview. “We did it in 2023 and 2024 and we can do it again. In an election year, Trump will be able to spend more time with voters outside the Beltway.” “The White House doesn’t have a choice but to have President Trump campaign in the midterm elections,” McLaughlin added. “Without Trump on the ballot, it’s hard to get his voters to turn out. If you can’t motivate the Trump voters, we’re not going to win in the midterms.” The White House seems to agree. Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, said in a podcast interview that the idea is to put Trump “on the ballot\" by having him campaign as if it’s 2024 all over again. For Trump, the question is whether he can muster the discipline to consistently deliver a two-part message. He needs to show he grasps that people are struggling while also hammering the point that he’s committed to making their lives better, political strategists say. That’s a tricky balance requiring some humility on Trump’s part, a recognition that “the golden age” he promised at the start of his term is still unrealized. Thus far, Trump blames lingering inflation on Biden, a bogeyman he continues to bash even as the economy bears his imprint with each passing day. He says there is much for voters to cheer, including gas prices, which have fallen from $3.03 a gallon one year ago to $2.92 now; the stock market, where the S&P 500 index is up 16% this year; and new foreign investment in the U.S. totaling trillions of dollars. As for the affordability issue, he calls it a \"hoax\" perpetrated by Democrats. On his social media site last week, Trump wrote that “affordability, just 13 months ago, was a disaster for the American people, but now, it’s totally different! Prices are coming down fast.\" Still, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that Trump’s tariffs are pushing inflation higher than the rate would be otherwise. After falling to a low this year of 2.3% in April, inflation rose to 3% in September for the first time since January. September was the last month data was available. Even members of Trump’s own party have said that prices are too high and Republicans can't ignore them. “People aren’t dumb. They know when they go to the grocery store what it costs and what it doesn’t,” Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., told NBC News last week. Michael DuHaime, former political director at the Republican National Committee, put it this way: \"You can continue to talk about Biden or even Obama or Jimmy Carter if you want. The voters will only tolerate it for so long.” Past presidents faced a similar conundrum, with uneven results. No sitting president wants to concede that their economic policies haven’t delivered. Yet a president risks appearing callous by denying what’s obvious to people who can’t afford to buy ground beef at the supermarket. “One of the mistakes we made as part of the Biden team was not leading with more empathy,” Sam Cornale, former CEO of the Democratic National Committee, said in an interview. “We jumped right into trying to explain away the numbers, but voters weren’t feeling it.” An early look at Trump's midterm campaign message unfolded last week when he traveled to a casino resort in the Poconos for a rally devoted to the economy. He showed slides and talked up his record, saying his tariffs are sparking a wave of AI, auto and other types of factory construction. But true to form, he also veered off topic, trashing Biden, Powell, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, late night comedian Jimmy Kimmel, windmills and the African nation of Somalia. “We’re a little behind the 8-ball going into the 2026 election,” said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster, in an interview. “The bottom line on the Republican side is we need to focus on what voters are most concerned about: the economy and the cost of living,\" he said, adding that people don't care \"what happens in Somalia or the Middle East or other places. For the most part, they’re focused on their pocketbooks. So that’s what we need to be focused on.” Back at McDonald’s, there is no sign that Trump once traded his suit jacket for an apron in one of his most memorable campaign stops. In the wake of Trump's visit, Yelp disabled its reviews of the restaurant because of caustic write-ups. On occasion, customers will take pictures of the drive-thru window where Trump made his appearance. The staff has turned over since that time; none of the employees at work on a recent weekday were there when Trump showed up. As a company, McDonald's has faced pressures from what its CEO called a \"two-tier economy.\" A steep drop in traffic from lower-income customers played a part in the company's decision to revive its \"Extra Value Meal\" combos this fall, according to chief executive Chris Kempczinski. Teeling said he’s prepared to be patient while Trump’s economic policies kick in. “It has gone up,” he said of the cost of living. “No question about that. But Trump is a CEO. He can turn these things around. It’s going to take a year, maybe two.” Janice Hall, 72, a retired Philadelphia city employee who was eating a cheeseburger and French fries, agrees. “It’s going to slowly go down,” she said. “We haven’t given it any time yet. It’s not even been a year.” She said she’d vote for Trump again if she could. “I think he’s funny; he’s hysterical. He has a personality,” she said. William Sanginiti, 72, a retired engineer, said over a hamburger and a Coke: “There’s always someone who’s going to complain about something. I’m not. I try to live within my means.” A dissenting note came from one of the regulars. Drinking a coffee, a 76-year-old retired truck driver said he doubts Trump will succeed in reducing prices. He said he’s had to alter his spending habits to make ends meet. “I used to eat a lot of beef; I can’t afford that,\" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Even when I see reduced prices at different supermarkets, they’re still on the expensive side.” He mentioned the unemployment rate, which stood at 4.4% in September, the highest it has been in the last four years. “A lot of the people who voted for him, they didn’t vote for the layoffs,” he said.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-served-mcdonalds-connect-voters-affordability-economy-polling-rcna248821","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251118-donald-trump-mcdonalds-2-es-f3921d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 10:00:40","author":"Peter Nicholas","authors":["Peter Nicholas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":387275460,"title":"Nancy Pelosi calls female US president in her lifetime unlikely: ‘Marble ceiling’","text":"Nancy Pelosi, the outgoing congresswoman and former House speaker, has conceded that she may not see a woman be elected US president in her lifetime.\n\nThe California Democrat said as much in a USA Today interview published on Sunday with her retirement looming after four decades in Congress – and invoked a turn of phrase referring to a metaphorical barrier impeding advancement in a profession that often confronts women and racial minorities.\n\n“It’s not a glass ceiling. It’s a marble ceiling,” Pelosi told the publication while discussing the defeats her party colleagues Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris respectively endured against Donald Trump in the 2016 and 2024 presidential elections – as well as institutional resistance she met during her own rise on Capitol Hill.\n\n“I thought certainly the American people are far ahead of the Congress in terms of their acceptance or their enthusiasm for a woman to be president of the United States.”\n\nShe added: “I always thought that a woman would be president of the United States long before a woman would be speaker of the House.”\n\nWith that not occurring, USA Today reported that Pelosi had adjusted her timetable – and even “tempered” her optimism – for when a woman may assume the Oval Office.\n\n“I think it’s … maybe not in my lifetime,” Pelosi, who turns 86 in March, said to the outlet. But she made it a point to predict “within this next generation, there’ll be a woman” serving as US president.\n\nPelosi’s comments in some ways mirror ones delivered by former first lady Michelle Obama in November about whether the US could soon join its North American neighbors Mexico and Canada in having a female chief executive.\n\n“Sadly, we ain’t ready,” the attorney, author and wife of Barack Obama – the US president between 2009 and 2017 – said during a conversation posted on her YouTube page.\n\n“That’s why I’m like: ‘Don’t look at me about running ‘cause you all are lying – you are not ready for a woman.’ We got a lot of growing up to do and there’s still … a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it.”\n\nNonetheless, Harris, the former US vice-president, has been leading or placing highly in polls of potential 2028 Democratic candidates for the White House. As Axios noted, she also expanded a tour promoting her 2024 campaign memoir 107 Days and appeared before the Democratic National Committee in moves interpreted by many as signs that she is potentially gearing up for another presidential run.\n\nPelosi joined Congress in 1988 to represent San Francisco. She won election to the post 20 times and was the first woman to serve as US House speaker, a role she held from 2007 to 2011 and 2019 to 2023.\n\nIn the USA Today interview, she revisited her role in convincing Joe Biden, her fellow Democrat and longtime political friend, to drop out of seeking re-election to the White House in 2024. She said she and Biden have not spoken ever since he shelved his 2024 campaign before Trump – whom he defeated four years earlier – won a second term.\n\n“I’m saddened by it because I love him and I respect him,” Pelosi told USA Today of her estrangement from Biden. “But I respect his decision in that regard.”\n\nPelosi did say that she was grateful Biden issued a statement declaring her “the best speaker of the House in American history” when she announced in November that she would retire at the end of her final term in January 2027.\n\nOf her decision to retire as an octogenarian, Pelosi said to the publication, “It was time. I mean – I’ve been ready for a while.”\n\nPelosi also reportedly said, with an exasperated tone, that she is commonly asked: “What are you going to do next?”\n\nPelosi told USA Today she mostly replies with something to the effect of: “I don’t have to do anything – I’m old!”","summary":"Former House speaker, 85, expects woman to assume Oval Office this generation but concedes she may not live to see it\n\nNancy Pelosi, the outgoing congresswoman and former House speaker, has conceded that she may not see a woman be elected US president in her lifetime.\n\nThe California Democrat said as much in a USA Today interview published on Sunday with her retirement looming after four decades in Congress – and invoked a turn of phrase referring to a metaphorical barrier impeding advancement in a profession that often confronts women and racial minorities.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/nancy-pelosi-female-president","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac809c2c649abb38a17a9fc0f7f1432010e553e1/397_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 10:00:29","author":"Ramon Antonio Vargas","authors":["Ramon Antonio Vargas"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.179},{"id":387168258,"title":"Former Israeli hostage: Trump’s election instilled fear in Hamas captors","text":"Omer Shem Tov, a 20-year-old Israeli who was held hostage by Hamas in the Gaza Strip for 505 days, has recounted how Donald Trump’s election as U.S. President dramatically altered the behavior of his captors. \n\nKidnapped during the Nova music festival on October 7, 2023, Shem Tov shared his experiences in an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\n“As soon as Trump was elected, I saw the fear in their eyes,” he said. “They knew the situation was going to change… they were very frightened.” According to Shem Tov, this fear led to noticeable changes in his treatment and daily life in captivity after Trump’s victory on November 5, 2024.\n\nDuring the final five months of his detention, Shem Tov was forced to dig, clean, and move explosives in Hamas tunnels, while also carrying food. He described significant stockpiles of supplies kept by his captors, contrasted with the meager rations he received, often only a few biscuits.\n\nShem Tov learned the results of the American election from his captors, who had a television in the tunnels and primarily watched Al Jazeera. He overheard discussions expressing their hope that Kamala Harris would win. “After the election, everything changed,” he said. “The amount of food, their behavior—everything indicated they were preparing for something bigger.” He also described enduring his 21st birthday in captivity, a day marked by fear, extreme hunger, and mistreatment.\n\nReleased in February 2025 under a hostage agreement, Shem Tov later traveled to Washington and met with Donald Trump at the White House. “I told him that many in Israel believed he had been sent by God to help bring back the hostages,” he said.

Reiner directed the 1989 romantic comedy “When Harry Met Sally,” starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.\n\nHe was also an outspoken supporter of liberal causes in Hollywood, backing efforts to secure equal marriage rights for LGBTQ people and create California’s First 5 program, which provides child development programs funded by taxes on tobacco products. — AFP","url":"https://kuwaittimes.com/article/37143/lifestyle/us-police-probe-deaths-of-director-rob-reiner-wife-as-apparent-homicide/","image":"https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2025/12/15/334950.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-15 08:18:00","author":"Kuwait Times","authors":["Kuwait Times"],"language":"en","source_country":"kw","sentiment":0.13},{"id":387029418,"title":"Schoen: Will Newsom’s record derail White House bid?","text":"Following a series of off-year election wins, and amid growing frustration with the Trump administration, Democrats’ 2028 chances look much brighter than last year at this time.\n\nAs such, California Gov. Gavin Newsom – the current Democratic frontrunner – would figure to have a slightly easier path to the Oval Office, assuming he wins the nomination.\n\nThat being said, while Newsom has very successfully built his national profile, it would be a mistake to overlook his numerous vulnerabilities, any of which could derail his presidential ambitions.\n\nCertainly, the biggest risk to Newsom is his own record in California. \n\nIndeed, the Golden State ranks #50 in affordability according to a US News & World Report ranking at a time when that issue is paramount. \n\nMoreover, despite having the nation’s top-ranked business environment, an economy bigger than India or the United Kingdom, and the benefit of being the home of Silicon Valley, California ranks near the bottom on economic growth (45th). \n\nWorse still, even with California’s tax rate among the highest in the country, the state ranks 42nd in terms of its fiscal stability.\n\nTo be sure, mismanaging California’s finances has been a feature – rather than a bug – of Newsom’s tenure. \n\nFrom FY 2018-2019 – the year before Newsom took office – California’s budget has grown by roughly 61%, a staggering figure.\n\nCalifornia’s $18 billion shortfall – the fourth consecutive year with a deficit – is set to nearly double to $35 billion by FY 2027-2028 according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst Office.\n\nTo that end, it’s not simply that Newsom oversaw massive spending and government expansion that makes him particularly vulnerable on his record. \n\nRather, it’s that despite significant spending, Newsom has not delivered solutions to the real problems facing the state.\n\nHomelessness – which California has spent $24 billion combatting since 2019 per analysis from the Hoover Institution – continues to plague the state. \n\nIn fact, from 2019 to 2024, the homeless population increased by “about 30,000, to more than 181,000….California spent the equivalent of about $160,000 per person (based on the 2019 figure)” over five years, yet the situation has only gotten worse.\n\nGoing hand in hand with homelessness is the crime situation. Ranking just 43rd on public safety is not a record to stand on when Americans are concerned about the safety of our streets.\n\nThe same goes for immigration, where Newsom took center stage pushing back on Trump.\n\nAmericans may dislike Trump’s heavy-handedness when it comes to deportations, but they do not want candidates advocating for open borders and amnesty for all.\n\nIt’s easy to imagine Newsom’s Republican – or Democrat – opponents seizing on perceptions of him as weak on crime and too far-left on immigration to hammer him in swing states.\n\nTo be clear, this is not to say Newsom has no shot. \n\nRight now, he’d likely win the Democratic nomination and then could very well win the general election. \n\nFresh off a high profile Proposition 50 win, Newsom’s popularity has soared at home, reaching 56% favorability in polling from the Public Policy Institute of California – up 10-points from June. \n\nSimilarly, he remains the top choice among Democrats for their party’s 2028 nominee, leading Kamala Harris by 6-points (26% to 20%) per RealClearPolitics.\n\nNewsom has also emerged as the most vocal Democratic leader at a time when the party has a large leadership vacuum. \n\nFurther, he is an extremely savvy politician who has taken steps to shift perceptions that he is too far-left. \n\nThis much was on display when Democrats were shunning anyone opposed to their platform, yet Newsom hosted right-wing stalwarts Steve Bannon and the late Charlie Kirk on his podcast. \n\nHe’s also gone on Fox News for debates with conservative hosts, and – vocally at least – come out against some far-left policies as a way of trying to remedy his vulnerabilities.\n\nConversely, California is not remotely representative of the country as a whole.\n\nThus, Newsom’s popularity is unlikely to translate, and it’s dubious whether his rhetoric will make up for his record.\n\nPut another way, Newsom has an uphill challenge convincing voters across the country that his leadership of California qualifies him to lead the country. \n\nWith that in mind, consider California’s problems rebuilding following the Palisades fire.\n\nAs the Wall Street Journal reported, “reminders are everywhere that public officials failed to prepare, failed to respond, and have spent much of the time since…failing to allow homeowners to rebuild.”\n\nEven after the state government – with Newsom’s urging – took steps to cut regulations, the first home in the Palisades was just rebuilt. \n\nThe house cannot be occupied – it’s a show home – yet the fact that just one of the 6,837 structures to be destroyed has been rebuilt is hardly an endorsement of Newsom’s management skills.\n\nFinally, Newsom’s full-throated defense of former President Biden during the 2024 campaign may come back to haunt him.\n\nWhen concerns were growing louder over Biden’s competency, Newsom was one of his staunchest allies, setting up uncomfortable questions over whether Newsom lied to the American people or could not see what millions of voters clearly saw. \n\nUltimately, in spite of these vulnerabilities, Newsom must be considered Democrats’ most likely nominee. He has a larger national profile than virtually any other Democrat, and his ambitions have been obvious for years. \n\nIf he’s successful in the primary, he very well may win a general election if voters are desperate for change from a Trump administration that’s increasingly unpopular.\n\nBut make no mistake, a Gavin Newsom presidency is certainly not a foregone conclusion. Polished as he is, Newsom’s record will come back to bite. And, popular as he may be among Democrats, swing voters in purple states will decide the 2028 election – and they may be more hesitant to buy what he is selling.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"Polished as he is, Newsom’s record will come back to bite.

The bodies of the acclaimed actor and director, 78, and his 68-year-old spouse were found at their Brentwood property on Sunday (December 14), with Los Angeles Police confirming they are probing an \"apparent homicide\". As new details emerges from the disturbing case and the devastated family confirmed \"the tragic passing\" of their beloved ones, the Daily Star uncovers everything that we know so far about their deaths. On Sunday night, People magazine reported that Nick Reiner was allegedly involved. The New York Post identified the 32-year-old as a person of interest in the case. However, authorities have not yet verified these claims. The family’s struggles were previously depicted in a film that Rob and Nick co-created a decade ago. Nick Reiner has reportedly battled addiction for many years, a struggle that became the focus of the family’s semi-autobiographical 2015 drama, Being Charlie, The Hollywood Reporter reported. Being Charlie, co-written by Nick Reiner and directed by dad Rob, was a brutally honest look at their family’s battle with Nick’s addiction, with Cary Elwes and Nick Robinson playing their on-screen stand-ins. The film, which debuted at TIFF in 2015, didn’t sugarcoat the chaos as Rob admitted, “When Nick would tell us that it wasn’t working for him, we wouldn’t listen… we listened to [the experts] when we should have been listening to our son.” Michele added: “We were so influenced by these people. They would tell us he’s a liar… and we believed them.” Nick, reflecting on his lowest point, shared: “I got sick of it… I’m not supposed to be out there on the streets and in homeless shelters doing all these … things.” At a Q&A, Rob confessed: “we didn’t set out for it to be cathartic or for it to be therapeutic, but it turned out to be that,” though Nick admitted: “Sometimes it would get overwhelming for me.” Critics said the film exposed “two warring agendas”, a son desperate to show recovery isn’t simple, and a dad hoping for happy endings that aren’t so easy to find. Law enforcement insiders revealed to TMZ.com that the victims at the Brentwood residence sustained wounds \"consistent with a knife [attack]\", though LAPD Deputy Chief Alan Hamilton stressed that officers have not yet pinpointed a suspect. At a press briefing, he stated: \"We have not identified a suspect at this time. No one has been detained.\" PEOPLE confirmed the Los Angeles Fire Department rushed to the couple's residence at approximately 3:30 p. m. on Sunday afternoon to deliver medical assistance, but discovered the pair had already died. The Los Angeles Police Department subsequently verified that the inquiry into this tragedy is being spearheaded by the robbery homicide division, who are handling the deaths as an \"apparent homicide\". A post on X (formerly known as Twitter) from LA Police Department's media relations division read: \"On December 14th, at 3:40 pm, LAPD officers responded to a death investigation in the 200 block of S. Chadbourne Ave. Inside the residence, officers discovered 2 decedents. \"The identity of the decedents has not yet been confirmed. Robbery Homicide Division (RHD) responded to the residence, which has been identified as the home of Rob Reiner. \"At this time, no further details are available as this is an ongoing RHD investigation, into an apparent homicide.\" LAPD Deputy Chief Alan Hamilton said investigators need to get a search warrant to conduct a “full crime scene investigation” at Rob Reiner’s home, CNN reported. He told media: “We’re waiting for the legal process to move forward. \"We have to obtain a search warrant for the residence. Once that is complied with, we will be conducting a full crime scene investigation on the interior and exterior of the residence and the surrounding neighborhood.” The house is in the exact same state as it was when the officers arrived, Hamilton said, as per CNN. Former US President Barack Obama wrote on X that he and his wife, Michelle, are “heartbroken by the tragic passing of Rob Reiner and his beloved wife, Michele”. He said: “Rob’s achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen. \"But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people — and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action. Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired.” Former US Vice President Kamala Harris described Rob and Michele Reiner as “dear friends” on X, as she wrote: “Rob Reiner’s work has impacted generations of Americans. \"The characters, dialogue, and visuals he brought to life in film and television are woven throughout our culture. Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America’s democracy. “Rob and his wife Michele loved each other very much. They were dear friends, and Doug and I are devastated to learn of their passing. \"Our thoughts are with their loved ones during this tragic time.” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has since paid her respects to the couple, stating: \"This is a devastating loss for our city and our country. \"Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice. An acclaimed actor, director, producer, writer, and engaged political activist, he always used his gifts in service of others. \"Personally, I am heartbroken by the tragic loss of Rob and his wife Michele. I knew Rob and have tremendous respect for him.\" She continued: \"I want to thank all of the first responders who were called to this tragic event. The investigation is ongoing. \"I'm holding all who loved Rob and Michele in my heart.\" California Governor Gavin Newsom also expressed his condolences, saying: \"Rob was the big-hearted genius behind so many of the classic stories we love, with projects as wide-ranging as The Princess Bride to A Few Good Men. \"His boundless empathy made his stories timeless, teaching generations how to see goodness and righteousness in others – and encouraging us to dream bigger. That empathy extended well beyond his films. Rob was a passionate advocate for children and for civil rights - from taking on Big Tobacco to fighting for marriage equality to serving as a powerful voice in early education. \"He made California a better place through his good works. Rob will be remembered for his remarkable filmography and for his extraordinary contribution to humanity.\" Michele Singer Reiner, who tragically died alongside her husband of over 30 years, was a multi-talented creative force in Hollywood. She launched her career as a photographer, contributing to projects like the “MysteryDisc” video game series and the acclaimed thriller “Misery”, directed by Rob Reiner. Michele also stepped in front of the camera, appearing in Nora Ephron’s holiday comedy “Mixed Nuts”. As a producer, she played a key role in several of her husband’s films, including “Shock and Awe” and the recently released “Spinal Tap II: The End Continues”. Her work on the documentary “Albert Brooks: Defending My Life,” which Rob directed, earned her an Emmy nomination. Michele’s producing credits also include “God & Country,” a documentary exploring Christian nationalism in America. Reiner, the son of actor/director Carl Reiner and actress/singer Estelle Reiner, launched his Hollywood career as an actor, portraying Mike 'Meathead' Stivic in the popular sitcom All in the Family from 1971 to 1979. This role bagged him two Primetime Emmy Awards. His acting portfolio also includes roles in the 1993 rom-com Sleepless in Seattle, The First Wives Club in 1996, the 1998 thriller Primary Colors, and the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street. However, he is most renowned for his directing work, which began in the early 1980s with the 1984 music mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap. He then directed Stand by Me (1986), the 1987 fantasy adventure The Princess Bride, and the 1989 rom-com When Harry Met Sally... It was during this time that he met his wife Michele. Reiner continued his directorial journey with the Stephen King adaptation Misery in 1990 and the courtroom drama A Few Good Men in 1992, which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. His other films include 1995's The American President, And So It Goes in 2014, and 2017's Shock and Awe. His final film saw him return to his roots, bringing Spinal Tap back to the big screen for a sequel, Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, which premiered earlier this year. Reiner was wedded to Penny Marshall from 1971 to 1981, during which time he adopted her daughter from a previous relationship, the actress Tracy Reiner. Subsequently, he tied the knot with photographer Michele, whom he met while filming When Harry Met Sally... The couple went on to have three children together, Jake, Nick and Romy.
