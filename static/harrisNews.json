The political elite in San Francisco still recall the time Mr. Clinton’s Secret Service agents got trapped in Ms. Tompkins Buell’s elevator and had to be rescued by firefighters.\n\nIn other words, the Pacific Heights tower built in the 1920s is not the sort of place where you would expect to find an acerbic, conservative cryptocurrency executive with a fondness for President Trump and Elon Musk.\n\nNonetheless, Jesse Powell wanted in.\n\nMr. Powell, an early Bitcoin proponent and the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, had his heart set on unit No. 9 and its sprawling 3,500 square feet three levels below Ms. Tompkins Buell’s penthouse.

Yet for some time now, it has been wandering from science to politics.\n\nA recent op-ed, titled “How feminism can guide climate change by action,” demonstrates how completely off the rails this once prestigious magazine has gone.\n\nTo say the article is simply “bad science” would not be accurate. There is no science in it at all. Here is a small sample:\n\nFeminism gives us the analysis, tools and movement to create a better climate future . . . Climate policymaking needs to take into account the expertise that women, including indigenous and rural women, bring to bear on issues like preserving ecosystems and environmentally sustainable agriculture . . . We must redistribute resources away from male-dominated, environmentally harmful economic activities towards those prioritizing women’s employment, regeneration and care for both people and ecosystems.\n\nFans of Scientific American might have hoped that this kind of activist journalism would leave the magazine along with former editor Laura Helmuth, who finished her nearly five-year tenure in November.\n\nInstead, it appears that little has changed.\n\nDerangement\n\nOther articles published since her departure include a defense of puberty blockers (which makes the striking claim that “the underlying principles of trans [healthcare] could make everyone healthier”) and a first-person perspective of a Just Stop Oil campaigner’s arrest.\n\nUnder Helmuth, the magazine broke with its 175-year-old tradition of impartiality when it endorsed the candidacy of Joe Biden in 2020, followed by Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nFittingly, Helmuth’s resignation followed one of the most severe cases of Trump Derangement Syndrome witnessed during November’s election, which she shared with the world on Bluesky.\n\n“I apologize to younger voters that my Gen X is so full of f–k-ing fascists,” Helmuth wrote after Trump’s re-election. She then added, for good measure:\n\nEvery four years I remember why I left Indiana (where I grew up) and remember why I respect the people who stayed and are trying to make it less racist and sexist. The moral arc of the universe is not going to bend itself . . . Solidarity to everybody whose meanest, dumbest, most bigoted classmates are celebrating early results because f–k them to the moon and back.\n\nHelmuth’s intemperate remarks raise several questions.\n\nFirst, what was she thinking? Presumably, to avoid charges of bias, you’d think the editor of a major scientific magazine would at least try to maintain a modicum of discretion in their public comments.\n\nDid she not realize that her comments might put some people off Scientific American who didn’t happen to share her politics?\n\nOne also wonders what the board of Springer Nature, which owns Scientific American, saw in Helmuth that led her to become just the ninth editor in the magazine’s long and storied history. It can’t have been for an impartial, objective approach.\n\nIn truth, Helmuth’s social-media rants and political endorsements are merely a symptom of the broader demise of Scientific American.\n\nIt is hard to imagine now, but this is the same magazine that published Albert Einstein’s generalized theory of gravitation and Nikola Tesla on the possibility of electro-static generators.\n\nA more recent sample of the Scientific American’s work under Helmuth would find headlines such as “Modern mathematics confronts its white, patriarchal past,” “Denial of evolution is a form of white supremacy” and a landmark takedown of “Star Wars” titled “Why the term JEDI is problematic for describing programs that promote justice, equity, diversity and inclusion.”\n\nNot content with publishing woke, unscientific nonsense, Scientific American has at times been little more than a mouthpiece for progressive and government orthodoxies.\n\nDuring the pandemic, it published multiple articles supposedly “debunking” the lab-leak theory — now all but accepted by the majority of Western governments.\n\nIt even trashed the Cass Review, which highlighted the lack of scientific evidence for the treatments given out to young people by Britain’s gender-identity services.\n\nPerhaps the lowest point for Scientific American was in 2021, following the death of legendary evolutionary biologist EO Wilson.\n\nRather than celebrate Wilson, Scientific American excoriated him over his “dangerous ideas” and “problematic beliefs.”\n\nHelmuth presumably had no idea that Wilson, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and recipient of the Crafoord Prize from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (the equivalent of a Nobel Prize for fields not covered by the Nobel Awards), had published his “dangerous ideas” and “problematic beliefs” in the Scientific American over several decades.\n\nScientific American is far from alone in abandoning science for wokery, of course. Formerly reputable publications, such as Nature, the New England Journal of Medicine, the Lancet and the British Medical Journal, just to name a few, now routinely feature articles replete with “progressive” agitprop.\n\nIt’s safe to say that the golden age of scientific journals is over. The fall of Scientific American proves that the old truism — that when you introduce science into politics, you are left only with politics — works just as well in the reverse.\n\nScience will struggle to recover from these attempts to politicize it.\n\nCory Franklin’s new book, “The Covid Diaries 2020-2024: Anatomy of a Contagion As It Happened,” is now available.

Trump’s history with the defending Super Bowl champions","text":"President Donald Trump is taking a break from testing the limits of the U.S. Constitution to attend Sunday’s Super Bowl match-up between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles, making him the first sitting president to watch the big game up close.\n\nFor its part, the NFL is getting ready for Trump’s attendance, beefing up security protocols ahead of the game after a terrorist attack in New Orleans last month.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 47th president and WWE Hall of Famer declined to weigh in on who he thought would lift the Lombardi trophy, but he gave a nod to the reigning champs.\n\n“I don’t want to say but there’s a certain quarterback that seems to be a pretty good winner,” Trump told reporters after signing an executive order withdrawing from the United Nations Human Rights Council.\n\nWith the president seemingly ready to cheer on the boys from Arrowhead, it’s worth taking a look back at Trump’s storied relationship with the football powerhouse and its personalities.\n\nTravis Kelce (and Taylor Swift)\n\n3-time Super Bowl champion, \"Saturday Night Live\" host and Chiefs star Travis Kelce has a complicated relationship with Trump, to say the least. Kelce largely avoids politics but did appear in a pro-COVID-19 vaccine commercial for Pfizer in 2023, enraging anti-vax members of the MAGA faithful.\n\nKelce’s girlfriend and superstar Chiefs fan Taylor Swift has twice endorsed Trump’s challengers in presidential elections and spoken out in support of progressive social issues. Her support of former Vice President Kamala Harris last year earned a hateful, all-caps callout from Trump on Truth Social.\n\nKelce and Swift were at the heart of a Trumpworld conspiracy theory last year when conservative media figures suggested the couple would endorse Joe Biden from the field after Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nEver the diplomat, the KC tight end told reporters it would be “a great honor” to play with the president in attendance.\n\n“It's a great honor, I think – you know, no matter who the president is – I know I'm excited because it's the biggest game of my life,” Kelce said. “And having the president there – it's the best country in the world – and that's pretty cool.”\n\nPatrick and Brittany Mahomes\n\nLike his teammate, Patrick Mahomes has never endorsed or condemned the president, though he did say it would be “cool” to play in front of Trump.\n\nThe Chiefs quarterback was the subject of Trump’s latest flubbed anecdote earlier this week. Trump falsely credited Senator Tommy Tuberville, R.-Ala., with coaching Mahomes in college at Texas Tech. There was just one problem with the claim: Mahomes and Tuberville's tenures with the Red Raiders never overlapped. Tuberville left the team in 2012, and Mahomes played his first game for the school in 2014.\n\nTuberville clarified in an interview with Megyn Kelly that he “recruited” Mahomes but didn’t coach him, a claim which faced further revision from the all-star himself. \n\n“He did not recruit me at the time,” Mahomes shared with Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Gabriela Carroll. “I don’t remember if I ever got to meet him or not.”\n\nMahomes declined to weigh in on Trump ahead of the election last year, but his wife Brittany Mahomes stirred controversy with a click.\n\nIn August, social media detectives noticed Brittany Mahomes had liked – and later un-liked – one of Trump’s campaign posts on Instagram. While the move was from an endorsement, that didn't stop then-candidate Trump from taking it as one. The hard-campaigning Trump went on Fox News to claim one of the league's most visible WAGs was “a big Trump fan.” \n\nPatrick Mahomes brushed off Trump’s claim that his wife was a MAGA die-hard in a news conference last September.\n\n“In these political times, people are going to use stuff here and there,” Mahomes told reporters. “But I can't let that affect how I go about my business every single day and live my life and try to live it to the best of my ability.”\n\nThat gentle brush-off didn't keep Trump from congratulating the couple on Thursday after the birth of their youngest daughter.\n\n“Congratulations to the Chiefs' GREAT Quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, and his very beautiful and BRILLIANT wife, Brittany, on the birth of their new baby daughter, Golden Raye,” he wrote in a post to Truth Social. “It’s happy times in the wonderful Mahomes family. See you all on Sunday!” \n\nHarrison Butker\n\nKicker Harrison Butker is the most likely member of the Chiefs to have read the Project 2025 playbook.\n\nButker made headlines last summer for delivering a fire-and-brimstone commencement address at Benedictine College that many labeled misogynistic, antisemitic and homophobic. \n\nHe later endorsed Trump as the most “pro-life” choice for president in September, days after speaking at a rally for far-right Missouri Senator Josh Hawley.\n\n“I’m supporting the president that’s going to be the most pro-life president, and I think Donald Trump is the most pro-life president,” Butker told Laura Ingraham on Fox News last year. “That's a topic that is the most crucial topic for me. I want us to be fighting for the most vulnerable, fighting for the unborn, and that’s what we should prioritize.”\n\nPolitics aside, the Chiefs' long-time head coach Andy Reid is ready to visit the Trump White House if his team wins.\n\nReid, who has led the Chiefs to a 15-2 record this season, visited former President Joe Biden in the White House twice, claiming then that he would do the same regardless of the president’s party.\n\n\"You know, you put all the politics aside. You're not Democratic. You're not Republican. You're not Independent. You're just, you're an American,\" Reid said on visiting the White House in 2023.\n\nReid was slated to visit Trump in the White House in 2020 following his first championship win with the Chiefs, but COVID-19 scrapped that trip.\n\nThe Hunt Family\n\nThough Trump is reportedly floating axing special tax breaks for sports team owners that could hit Chiefs owner Clark Hunt right in the pocketbook, his family members have shown support for the two-time president.\n\nHis daughter, Gracie Hunt, said the president’s messages to the Chiefs were “pretty cool” and “pretty awesome” in a Wednesday appearance on Riley Gaines’ “Gaines for Girls” podcast. She went on to defend Butker’s controversial comments that she says were motivated by his faith.\n\n“Harrison [Butker] is an amazing guy, and the most kind, genuine person,” the younger Hunt said. “He is an awesome family man, they're so sweet and precious… Harrison and his boldness in his faith encourages other guys to be bold in their faith.”\n\nWhether Trump and the Chiefs are rooting for each other or not, there’s no love lost between POTUS and the Eagles. In 2018, Trump disinvited the then-Super Bowl champs because a handful of players signaled their intentions to stay home. \n\n“The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event,” Trump tweeted at the time. “Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!”","summary":"Trump will be the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl, but he's interacted with the champs before","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/02/06/hail-to-the-chiefs-trumps-history-with-the-defending-super-bowl-champions/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2025/02/travis_kelce_donald_trump_2197989616_2189239295.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 23:49:40","author":"Griffin Eckstein","authors":["Griffin Eckstein"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.289},{"id":287889532,"title":"Wikipedia Bans ‘100 Percent’ of Conservative Media","text":"By Jim Thomas From Newsmax\n\nWikipedia has been accused of favoring left-leaning media sources while almost completely blacklisting major conservative outlets, according to a new report by the Media Research Center (MRC) released Monday.\n\nThe report reveals the self-proclaimed online encyclopedia disproportionately dismisses right-leaning news organizations as unreliable while granting credibility to liberal sources.\n\nWikipedia, one of the world’s most widely used online information sources, faces scrutiny over claims of political bias in its treatment of news organizations.\n\nThe MRC report stated that “Wikipedia effectively blocks 100% of right-leaning media sources — the ones more likely to give fair treatment to the majority in Congress as well as to incoming officials to the Trump administration. On the contrary, only 16% of left-wing media sources fail to win Wikipedia’s stamp of approval.”\n\nThe report assessed how Wikipedia categorizes news sources, finding that conservative outlets such as Breitbart, The Daily Caller, Newsmax, One America News Network, and the Media Research Center are labeled as “generally unreliable” or effectively blacklisted.\n\nLuis Cornelio, the report’s author, expressed concern over the implications of these classifications.\n\n“Among the effectively blackballed media sources are Breitbart, The Daily Caller, Daily Mail, Newsmax, OANN, and the Media Research Center. Meanwhile, leftist media like The Atlantic, Jacobin, Mother Jones, ProPublica, The Guardian, and National Public Radio are given the green light,” he wrote.\n\n“This blatant misinformation means that Wikipedia is purposely feeding Americans information exclusively through the lens of one side of the political spectrum — the left.”\n\nCornelio and Dan Schneider, vice president of MRC Free Speech America, further argued in an article for The Daily Wire that Wikipedia’s sourcing policies distort political narratives.\n\n“This imbalanced treatment is intentional and tactical. It is a deliberate effort to exclude right-of-center perspectives from the online discourse, with the obvious goal of disparaging, slandering, and maligning anyone who opposes the radical left agenda,” they wrote.\n\nThe report also claimed that Wikipedia’s editorial decisions impact on how political figures are portrayed.\n\nIt alleged that Wikipedia pages for President Donald Trump’s appointees and other conservative figures are shaped primarily by left-leaning media, resulting in negative portrayals.\n\nIn contrast, Democrat figures receive more favorable coverage.\n\n“This manipulation of information extends beyond just blacklisting certain sources — it actively distorts political narratives,” Cornelio and Schneider wrote.\n\n“Due to the systemic bias in Wikipedia’s sourcing policies, the pages on Trump’s appointees are overwhelmingly shaped by left-leaning media, presenting a skewed, and often hostile, portrayal of these individuals. The same treatment is not applied to Democratic figures, whose pages benefit from friendlier coverage and selective omission of controversies.”\n\nWikipedia has not publicly responded to the report’s findings.\n\nThe online encyclopedia claims to operate as a collaborative platform with volunteer editors responsible for content moderation.\n\nIts policies emphasize reliance on reputable sources, but debates about which outlets meet that standard have long been a point of contention.\n\nConservatives have long bemoaned that Wikipedia is nothing less than a political organization masquerading as a not-for-profit organization.\n\nJim Thomas ✉\n\nJim Thomas is a writer based in Indiana.

She said \"Thanks for asking if I'm okay. Because no one ever asks me that.\"\n\n'I felt her when she said that. People toss it out. \"How are you doing?\" But not many people really mean it. Or pay attention to the answer'\n\nAfter Harry and Meghan announced that they were saying goodbye to their royal duties and relocating to California, the couple, along with their then-one-year-old son, Archie, spent a few months living in Tyler's Beverly Hills mansion.\n\nThe sprawling 22-acre estate is set in the ultra-exclusive Beverly Ridge Estates guard-gated community, offering sweeping views of the city from the backyard.\n\nTyler denied that Meghan and Harry had been introduced to them by mutual friend Oprah (pictured on her show)\n\nIt was from there that the duo celebrated Archie's first birthday - and where he took his first steps - as they shared tiny glimpses of the home while appearing on video chats and in social media clips throughout their stay.\n\nDuring an interview with The Cut in 2022, Meghan, spoke out about her bond with Tyler, explaining that he got in touch with her after she first wed Harry in 2018.\n\nShe added that he sent her a 'note' in which he said he 'understood' the intense pressure she was under, and encouraged her to reach out if she ever needed help.\n\nShe soon began to open up to him about her struggles and the two grew close, despite them never even meeting in person.\n\n'Sometimes, you can tell your life story to a stranger on a plane as opposed to some of the people that are closest to you,' she told The Cut.\n\nMeanwhile Tyler previously shared about his friendship with the royal couple: 'They hid out at my house for a long time. It was so great.'\n\nSpeaking on Kelly Ripa's podcast in 2023, The Hollywood titan revealed that the duo had previously shared the same publicist whom he used to deliver a message of support.\n\n'I sent them a note... and just said, \"If you ever need anything, I'm here,\" and she called months later and just talked to me like I was a therapist and we just had a great conversation.'\n\nTyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey 'Tyler Perry's BOO! A Madea Halloween' film premiere, Los Angeles in 2016\n\n'It is very important for people in this business to have a safe place to land, to have a place where they can trust and talk freely and get advice that's not going to be biased or from somebody who wants something from them.'\n\nElaborating further, he said: 'Every day. Every day that they were there, I looked to see if anything's happening online. Nothing. They don't even know, so weeks and weeks they were there.\n\nTyler also featured in Meghan and Harry's Netflix series - where their closest confidantes and allies gave testimonies about their lives during and after the royal family. \n\nHe said he'd been inspired to get in touch with Meghan after seeing stories about her relationship with her father Thomas Markle in the press. \n\nHe said: 'I'm not a royal watcher, I don't really pay attention to a lot of stuff,' he said. 'But I saw something about her father [posing for the paparazzi]. I found it to be hurtful if he were my father.\n\n'And I couldn't even imagine this woman finding the man that she loved, the man of her dreams, and him being a Prince, and then to walk into all of that madness and need the security of family and then have your father do some horrible things.'\n\nMeghan added: 'That's where Tyler came into the picture,' she recalled. 'I had never met him before. He sent me a letter before the wedding just saying he was praying for me. And that if I ever needed anything he would be there.\n\n'Months and months and months went by. And then one day when we were in Canada I had called him. Finally, after years at that point.\n\n'[It was] the first time we ever spoke. And I was just a wreck, I was crying and crying. Like sometimes it's easier to just open up to someone who knows nothing at all. And that was that moment with me and Tyler.'\n\nMeghan recalled Tyler asking them, 'What can I do to make it easier? How can I help you?' \n\nInside Meghan Markle's close relationship with Tyler Perry as she supports him at LA gala\n\n'He was like, \"My house is safe and I'll make sure you have security. Take your time.\" I was like, \"We only need to stay for a week, we can find somewhere to live,\"' she continued.\n\n'He was like, \"You're not just going to stay for a week, you're going to stay for as long as you need and I'm going to get you there safely. And I'm gonna keep you there safely until you have somewhere to go.\"'\n\n'They just wanted to be free. Be free to love and be happy. They did not have a plan. There was no plan,' Tyler added.\n\nPerry previously explained why he offered help to the couple, insisting that it was a 'very difficult time for them' and that he wanted to 'support them' in any way possible.\n\nThe filmmaker added that he was inspired by Harry and Meghan's love, telling the Today show: 'What I know about the two of them - and I wish the world knew - how much these two people love each other.\n\n'They found each other, out of all these odds against them finding each other, they found each other.\n\n'The love they have is really, really moving and I wanted to do anything I could to support them.'\n\nHe added of Meghan and Harry’s relationship: 'If I don't have that, what she and Harry have, I don't want it. That's really amazing.'\n\nAfter Meghan and Harry purchased their own house, a sprawling mansion in Montecito located just a stone's throw from the home of another celebrity pal, Oprah, Tyler sent them a generous housewarming gift - a grand piano - with a note that read, 'Write the soundtrack for your life.'\n\nHe has since visited the couple, arriving on his $125million private jet in March 2023.\n\nHe flew for 20 minutes to Santa Barbara, where he and the Sussexes met for about two hours before he headed back to his jet, which then made its way to his empire in Atlanta, Georgia. \n\nThe plane was the same one Perry let Meghan and Harry use for their 'freedom flight' from to America in 2020, as they set out to begin their new lives. \n\nFor Meghan's birthday in 2022, the Madea star shared a sweet tribute to her on Instagram.\n\n'I've had a front row seat in your life for the past few years. I've watched you endure things that would have broken a lot of people,' he gushed.\n\n'I'm so incredibly proud to see how happy you, your husband, and your kids are now.' \n\nHe is also godfather to Harry and Meghan's daughter, Princess Lilibet, three. \n\nTyler reportedly attended her birthday party in June as she turned three, according to People Magazine. \n\nHowever, in December 2022, Tyler revealed he'd refused to travel to the UK for Lilibet's christening, despite being her godfather. \n\nHe suggested that he didn't want to take part in the pomp and circumstance of a traditional royal ceremony, telling the couple's bombshell Netflix docuseries that he didn't want to 'do all of that in the church with them and figure all of that out.'\n\nIn September, Meghan and Harry attended Tyler's star-studded 55th birthday bash with Oprah - showing that their friendship has only gone from strength to strength in recent months. \n\nThey appeared to be in great spirits, with Meghan grinning and giggling next to her husband in the backseat of a black Range Rover. \n\nThey spent hours partying with close pal Tyler, late into the night. \n\nPrior to their friendship, both Tyler and Meghan were close with tennis pro Serena Williams, who Meghan first met in 2010 at the Super Bowl. \n\nMeanwhile Serena and Tyler posed together at a 2014 Vanity Fair Oscar Awards afterparty. In addition, they have strong friendships with talk show host Oprah, and have both in the past been spotted with pop superstar Beyoncé. \n\nMeghan MarkleTyler PerryNetflix\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nMeghan Markle is among several historic figures - including Oprah and Maya Angelou - featured in project celebrating Black women, helmed by her pal Tyler Perry\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The Duchess of Sussex was included in a heartfelt tribute, which compiled photos of historical icons like Nina Simone as well as more recent personas, like Kamala Harris .","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14370179/meghan-markle-oprah-tyler-perry.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/06/23/94950057-0-image-m-19_1738883027535.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 23:22:04","author":"Editor,Elmira Tanatarova","authors":["Editor","Elmira Tanatarova"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.451},{"id":287879598,"title":"Nancy Pelosi gives five-word reply on whether relationship with Jill Biden can be fixed after brutal falling out","text":"Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave a five-word reply when asked Thursday if she would be able to repair her relationship with former first lady Jill Biden. \n\nPelosi has been at odds with the Bidens since she helped push President Joe Biden out of the 2024 presidential race after his disastrous late June debate performance. \n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post before leaving the White House, Dr. Biden said of Pelosi: 'We were friends for 50 years.' \n\n'It was disappointing,' the first lady said. \n\nNBC's Andrea Mitchell brought up Dr. Biden's comments Thursday in a sit-down with Pelosi that aired on MSNBC, asking the former speaker if there was a way to patch things up. \n\n'Well, I certainly hope so,' Pelosi replied. \n\nMitchell then asked if Pelosi had been in touch with the former president, who was spotted back in Washington, D.C. this week after spending the first days of his post presidency in Pelosi's home state. \n\n'No I haven't,' the California Democrat replied. \n\nPelosi indicated that she didn't believe Biden would have performed better against Trump than Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost all seven battleground states - though some by narrow margins. \n\n'Well, all I know is that we won a seat in the House,' Pelosi replied when Mitchell asked if Biden would have done better than Harris. 'We did not lose any seats.' \n\nThe 82-year-old Biden reportedly was telling allies he could have won against Trump after Harris lost the race in the waning days of his presidency. \n\nHe later stated that view out loud in a sit-down with USA Today's Susan Page. \n\n'It's presumptuous to say that, but I think yes,' Biden said. \n\nThe then-president based that opinion, he said, on polling he had seen - though most public polls showed his popularity underwater. \n\n'You know people were like, \"whoa, the Democrats lost,\"' Pelosi continued. 'No, we did not.' \n\nShe then answered Mitchell's question. \n\n'I think it would have been quite different with President Biden at the top of the ticket,' Pelosi said. \n\nShe also said of herself and the Bidens that 'we're all on a mission for the American people ... for America's working families.' \n\n'My whole passion about being in politics is for the children,' Pelosi said.

We don’t discriminate based on gender identity,” Lander said.\n\nTransgender medical treatment was a hot-button issue in last fall’s presidential campaign.\n\nTrump blasted former Vice President Kamala Harris over her support for government-guaranteed transgender surgeries for prison inmates and migrants held in detention facilities. Even Democratic strategists said ad was effective and hurt Harris with voters.\n\nLander said if he were mayor, he’d be urging hospitals to continue to provide the care, particularly those run by the city’s public hospital system, Health+Hospitals.\n\n“There’s a lot the mayor of New York City could be doing,” Lander said, referring to Mayor Eric Adams. “The mayor could be doing that as well.\n\n“That’s what I would do as mayor.”\n\nLander said he immediately called AG James when he heard about Trump’s order banning funding to hospitals that perform the surgeries and procedures.\n\nNew York’s major hospitals receive billions of dollars in Medicaid funding and medical grants. Hospitals that offer gender reassignment care — including NYU Langone and Mount Sinai — have reportedly stopped accepting new patients.\n\nJames, according to Lander, touched based with honchos at NYU Langone and Mount Sinai to let them know that the law of New York “requires them not to discriminate against [patients] based on gender identity.”\n\n“Trump is trying to deny that gender affirming care,” Lander said, calling the situation “urgent”\n\nBut many medical professionals oppose transition surgeries as harmful to minors.\n\n“Transgender treatment are a direct assault on a child’s mental and physical health,” Stanley Goldfarb, a former associate dean of the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Medicine and chairman of the group Do No Harm, said Wednesday in a Post op-ed column.\n\n“An overwhelming percentage of kids who are confused about their gender suffer from mental health or behavioral-health issues. Think depression, attention deficit disorder and autism.”\n\nGoldfarb said the young people need psychiatric help, adding, “What they don’t need are experimental, invasive and irreversible treatments that fundamentally change their developing minds and bodies. Transgender treatments are incredibly dangerous for kids.”\n\nOther countries, including England, have restricted trans surgery or treatment.\n\nEngland announced last year that it will not routinely offer puberty-blocking drugs to children at gender identity clinics, saying more evidence is needed about the potential benefits and harms.","summary":"City Comptroller Brad Lander backs sex change surgeries and procedures on transgender youths and blasted as discriminatory President Trump's executive order banning federal funding for such medical treatment.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/nyc-comptroller-brad-lander-backs-sex-change-operations-for-minors-opposes-trump-trans-ban/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/brand-lander-backs-transgender-surgery-98001780.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/48mXCAKF-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-06 23:01:40","author":"Carl Campanile","authors":["Carl Campanile"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":287892770,"title":"Dems ditch Kamala: Do they want common-sense leaders?","text":"Dems ditch Kamala: Do they want common-sense leaders? | Fox News Video\n\nto top close\n\nThis video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nFebruary 06, 2025\n\nDems ditch Kamala: Do they want common-sense leaders?\n\n'The Five' co-hosts discuss a former DNC official admitting no Democrats want former Vice President Kamala Harris to run again.\n\nCopy to clipboard\nCopy to clipboard\n\nWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOS\n\nLATEST NEWS | VIDEOS\n\nNOW - 8:00 PM\n\nFox News Channel\n\nThe Ingraham Angle\n\n7:00 PM - 8:00 PM\n\nJesse Watters Primetime\n\n8:00 PM - 9:00 PM\n\n9:00 PM - 10:00 PM\n\n10:00 PM - 10:30 PM\n\nFox Business Channel\n\n7:00 PM - 8:00 PM\n\n8:00 PM - 8:30 PM\n\n8:30 PM - 9:00 PM\n\n9:00 PM - 9:30 PM\n\n9:30 PM - 10:00 PM\n\n10:00 PM - 10:30 PM\n\nFox Weather Channel\n\nFox Weather\n\nLive Stream\n\nFox News Radio\n\nWATCH LIVE: Senate holds final confirmation vote on AG nominee Pam Bondi\n\nLive Stream\n\nFox News Channel Live\n\nWATCH LIVE: Senate holds final confirmation vote on AG nominee Pam Bondi\n\nLive Stream","summary":"&apos;The Five&apos; co-hosts discuss a former DNC official admitting no Democrats want former Vice President Kamala Harris to run again.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6368396505112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/dfb9f308-23ee-43c7-8862-40a5a8127def/131fc858-1e9f-4f94-a75c-a528f6244a39/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 22:56:05","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.38},{"id":287873196,"title":"Trump Elevates Brittany Mahomes Before 2025 Super Bowl Showdown Against Taylor Swift","text":"Not long after he praised Brittany Mahomes for her support, Donald Trump had harsh words for Taylor Swift over her endorsement of Kamala Harris for the presidential election. “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” the then-Republican-nominee wrote on Truth Social in September 2024.

(AP) — Chris Swanson, the high-profile sheriff of Michigan’s Genesee County, is launching a Democratic bid to become the battleground state’s next governor.\n\nFirst elected sheriff of Michigan’s fifth-largest county in 2020, Swanson’s gubernatorial bid — announced Thursday in an interview with The Associated Press — marks his full leap into politics after gaining national attention for marching with protesters in 2020 and speaking at the Democratic National Convention last August.\n\nHis candidacy comes as the Democratic Party seeks a new kind of candidate who can address top voter concerns such as immigration and public safety, issues Swanson plans to make central to his campaign.\n\n“As a sheriff, I take care of people. I protect people, I serve and I bring folks together,” Swanson said. “We’ve done that in Genesee County. Now, it’s time to do it for the entire state of Michigan and all 10 million people.”\n\nMichigan’s race to replace Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the high-profile Democrat facing term limits, is shaping up to be one of the most fiercely contested political battles of 2026.\n\nSwanson will join Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson in the Democratic primary, with Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II mulling a potential bid. On the Republican side, Aric Nesbitt, the top GOP state Senate leader, has announced his candidacy, with U.S. Rep. John James also considered to be a potential contender. Detroit’s once-Democratic Mayor Mike Duggan further shook up the race by entering as an independent.\n\n“It’s going to be a wide-open race,” said Adrian Hemond, a political strategist in Michigan. “All of the potential candidates on the Democrats’ side have some strong points, but they all have pretty obvious weaknesses as well.”\n\nThe biggest question surrounding Swanson’s campaign is whether he can compete in the primary against a candidate like Benson, who has won multiple statewide races and raised millions of dollars. Swanson remains largely unknown outside his county — 70 miles (110 kilometers) north of Detroit — and Democratic circles.\n\nStill, the sheriff’s appeal as a non-traditional candidate could resonate in a battleground state like Michigan, where winning requires broad, cross-party support. In the 2024 election, Swanson was reelected with 65% of the vote in Genesee County — running nearly 14 percentage points ahead of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\n“911 calls come in. You don’t ask if they’re Democrat or Republican. White, black, rich, poor. You take care of people,” said Swanson. “And I think in today’s world, especially in the state, that’s what people want. They want leaders that can inspire.”\n\nA recent typical day for Swanson included a press conference to announce an operation that led to the arrest of two Honduran immigrants for entering the country illegally. He then hurried upstairs to meet with jail inmates enrolled in an education program he launched in 2020 and that’s gaining national acceptance.\n\nIn one corner, men immersed themselves in virtual reality headsets, while others played cards or exchanged light-hearted banter with Swanson. Focused on inmate rehabilitation, the educational program has been studied by Harvard, replicated by the National Sheriffs’ Association and is being adopted in correctional facilities across the U.S..\n\nSwanson’s law enforcement approach first drew national headlines in May of 2020, days after a white Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd, a Black man.\n\nAt a protest in Flint, the largest city in Genesee County, Swanson removed his riot gear and marched alongside demonstrators. Swanson said this month that police had planned for a different response, but “as I was walking up, I thought, there’s got to be a better way.”\n\nSwanson’s quick decision drew praise from prominent Democrats, including Whitmer and former President Barack Obama. It also helped propel him to an appearance at the Democratic National Convention in August, where he wore his sheriff’s uniform and endorsed Harris in a brief speech.\n\nThe appearance was a rare show of law enforcement support for the then-vice president. Sheriffs in Michigan and across the country frequently aligned themselves with Donald Trump during his tough-on-crime, anti-illegal immigration presidential campaign.\n\n“No party owns law enforcement. Law enforcement is part of the people,” said Swanson, who said that the D.N.C. appearance cost him lifelong friendships.\n\nSwanson’s background could boost his appeal in a general election, especially as immigration remains a top voter concern this year. However, he may face challenges in the Democratic primary, where some in the party have made calls to reform law enforcement and even “defund the police.”\n\nSwanson’s chances in the primary could improve if Gilchrist enters the race, potentially splitting voters between the more traditional options of the Democratic secretary of state and lieutenant governor.\n\n“It’s time that we have a different type of candidate coming through the system, not just the next one up,” said Swanson. “People, I think, are hungry for something new and fresh. Certainly the party is. And I’m that person.”","summary":"FLINT, Mich.

Tim Walz returned home from the campaign trail to a divided state legislature. Minnesota’s public perception of the former vice presidential Democratic nominee is just as split. Walz ended 2024 with over $1 million in campaign cash, year-end campaign finance reports show. The blue wall state governor raised the bulk of those funds before joining Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential ticket, where he wore his camo hats and middle-class status as a badge of honor. Walz has not formally announced whether he will seek a third term for governor but said he will likely make a decision this summer. A spokesperson said Walz is focused on leading a split state legislature in the meantime. \"Regardless of the chaos unfolding in Washington, D.C., Governor Walz will continue working with Republicans and Democrats at the State Capitol to balance the budget and make Minnesota the best state to live, work, and raise a family,\" Walz’s spokesperson said in a statement. TIM WALZ SAYS LOSING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS 'PURE HELL,' ADMITS DEMS ARE 'FATIGUED' IN MSNBC INTERVIEW While Walz says he is committed to working across the aisle, Minnesota’s state house has spent weeks at a standstill. Republicans proposed a recall of their Democratic colleagues for failing to show up to work. \"They technically had the organizational majority to kick off on Jan. 14 when we began our legislative session,\" Republican state Sen. Mark Koran said. \"The Democrats refused to. They held a special swearing-in ceremony in secret for their 66 members, and then they've refused for over three weeks now to show up to the Minnesota House to organize, so they can do business.\" MINNESOTA LAWMAKER SOUNDS ALARM ON GOV WALZ'S 'RADICAL AGENDA' AHEAD OF ELECTION: 'SO HEINOUS' Koran said Walz has been missing in action, telling Fox Digital that the governor is anything but bipartisan. \"He is nonexistent as far as the Democrats holding this hostage,\" Koran said. \"He's not taking a leadership role. I can tell you about the only thing he does in a bipartisan manner is he doesn't work with Republicans or Democrats, and so he's very isolated and doesn't meet with anybody.\" Walz defended Minnesota Democrats for boycotting their legislative session in an interview with FOX 9 KMSP, elevating the state conflict to the national level by taking aim at DOGE’s ongoing federal layoffs. \"We are not going to allow you to do what we’re seeing at the federal level. You are not going to go in and fire state employees. You are not going to take power in a short-term window of gap. That’s not what the voters voted for,\" Walz said. Minnesota Republicans told Fox Digital that controversies on the campaign trail have tarnished his reputation back home. Walz’s background dominated headlines this summer; over claims of \"stolen valor\" for inconsistencies describing his military service, saying he \"misspoke\" when he said he visited Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and over his family's in vitro fertilization story that never was. Walz laughed off the missteps, calling himself a \"knucklehead.\" \"The average Minnesotans didn't really know who Tim Walz was,\" retired Minnesota State Patrol Lt. John Nagel told Fox Digital. \"With running for vice president, people suddenly realized this guy is not who so many of us thought he was. He’s not this happy grandpa teacher that wears plaid. He is an individual that wants to keep his power. He's lied to make himself look better. \"Walz's ego is bruised,\" Nagel added. \"He is not happy that he's not walking around as vice president.\" Nagel and Koran agreed the national reporting during the presidential campaign made Minnesotans think twice about Walz. \"I think Minnesotans should reject his political agenda, just as the nation did. He came back extraordinarily damaged. The Democrats are going to take him out within his own party, likely in the next gubernatorial primary. There's a Senate seat open in Minnesota. He wants the national spotlight. At the end of the day, if he has nothing else, I think he'll be running for governor again,\" Koran said. Newly elected DNC Chair Ken Martin, former chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) Party, said in a statement that Republicans \"have tried to tear down Governor Walz\" but the governor has maintained the trust of Minnesota voters by delivering key progressive policy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Partisan Republicans have tried to tear down Governor Walz, but the support and trust that he has earned from Minnesotans has endured,\" Martin said. \"From free school meals to paid family leave, the working-class agenda that Governor Walz and DFL leaders have championed enjoys strong support from a clear majority of Minnesotans. Our party is ready to fight with Governor Walz to lower costs while protecting critical investments in our schools and the programs that support working families.\"","summary":"Gov.

The bar is low. Most are looking for almost anyone to just do or say just about anything that could signal some sign of life for the moribund party. Even some Republicans, like former Representative Adam Kinzinger, are urging Democratic leaders to \"do something.\"While Democratic voters are begging their elected officials for some kind of concrete actions or ways to oppose the president, their representatives in Congress are being ridiculed over tone-deaf remarks and for \"acting like everything is fine.\"\"I'm sick and f---ing tired of our elected leaders pretending like everything is okay in the name of preserving comity,\" Brad Bauman, principal at the Raben Group and the former executive director of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told Newsweek.\"These folks need to start acting like everything is on the line because everything is truly on the line.

Users across the left-leaning Bluesky social network have been expressing outrage at the Democratic Party's relative silence in the face of President Trump's swift upending of the federal bureaucracy.On social media, Democrats are pleading for party leaders to start name-calling Republicans, to stop \"being out of touch,\" to get in front of the cameras about Trump's policies and to offer more than the same \"2 approved talking points.\"Much of that ire has been directed at Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer, the party's top elected leader, by name. A video clip in which Schumer, 84, leads a tepid chant of \"We will win!\" next to Rep. Maxine Waters, 86, as Rep. Al Green, 77, shakes his cane in the air, has gone viral across social media this week — reflecting what many progressives bemoan as the party's \"gerontocratic\" leadership.Newsweek reached out to Schumer's office for comment.Axios also reported Thursday that the offices of congressional Democrats were being inundated by a historically high volume of phone calls from angry constituents who don't think their leaders are doing enough to stand up to Trump.\"We are in the middle of one of the most consequential and scary moments in American history, where Trump and his allies are remaking every single piece of our government by fiat, and Senate Democrats seem to be slapping each other on the backs for asking tough questions from the dais,\" Bauman said.\"That simply is not meeting the moment with what it demands.\"The 'Problem Pointer-Outers'In Washington, Democrats have rallied outside of multiple federal agencies targeted for cuts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), flooded the White House with letters demanding information and oversight and vowed to use a federal funding deadline a leverage over the administration.But still, many think it's not enough.\"I am perfectly capable of pointing out the problems,\" Democratic strategist Keith Edwards told Newsweek. \"We don't need our senators and members of the House to do that. We don't need any more problem pointer-outers. We need problem solvers. They are not spectators. They are they are gladiators in the arena, and we need them to fight.\"Doug Gordon, a Democratic strategist and co-founder of UpShift Strategies, urged his party's leaders to \"abandon the cautious, poll tested, talking point based way they have communicated for the last several years and match the urgency the moment requires.\"\"People want to see action and fight,\" Gordon told Newsweek on Wednesday. \"In this moment, the actions Democrats take will speak much louder than the actual words they use. The status quo of sternly worded letters and Capitol Hill press conferences is not going to cut it. You can't bring a knife to a gun fight.\"Democratic leadership appears to have been caught flat-footed by the speed and urgency at which the new administration is operating, Edwards said.\"Project 2025 was known about for years. So, why wasn't anyone thinking, 'Well just in case he wins, here's our plan to stop it'?\" the strategist asked.\"Donald Trump is not a new idea, and [Democrats] certainly had a roadmap for what he wanted to do when in office. For some reason, it seems like our leadership has been surprised that he's doing what he said he was going to do.\"\"We have a three-month lame-duck period, where [President Joe Biden was] still the president, but we know a new person is coming,\" Edwards told Newsweek. \"So, they had at least three months of knowing for sure that Donald Trump was going to become the president, and it seems like there was no plan put in place.\"Lakshya Jain, a political data analyst and co-founder of the election-modeling website Split Ticket, said that much of the Democratic response to Trump 2.0 has been to just sit back and let him dominate the headlines in hopes that his \"flood the zone\" strategy will backfire on him. Jain said that while pubic opinion could turn on Trump as a result of his own words and actions, as it did during his first term, that means Democrats would essentially be up to nothing for the next five months.\"They're just sitting there looking to win, which is infuriating in the age of social media, because you want people doing stuff right now,\" Jain told Newsweek.Searching for the Next ObamaIn some ways, Democrats have been here before. After John Kerry lost the 2004 election to former President George W. Bush, the party was devastated and widely considered to be in need a major rebuilding. It would have been difficult in February of 2005 to imagine Democrats' fortunes would soon rise on the back of a little-known first-term senator from Illinois — who happened to be Black, with the middle name of Hussein.In politics, nothing is forever. But that is little solace for Democrats who see Trump operating with impunity and without some of the guardrails in place during his first term, when his administration was stocked with establishment Republicans who have all been jettisoned in favor of MAGA true believers this time around.It's increasingly clear—from conversations that Newsweek had with several Democratic strategists—that, like twenty years ago, the next face of the party is unlikely to be someone who is currently in its elected leadership ranks.\"When the party has no singular leader to coalesce around, what happens is you end up in this position where you have a whole bunch of very angry partisans who are sick and tired of seeing Donald Trump dominate the headlines, and to them, the party's seem to be directionless,\" Jain, of Split Ticket, said.That leadership vacuum might have the effect of giving younger Democrats a chance to rise through the ranks. To be sure, there are some elected Democrats attempting to do just that. Among them, a billionaire governor, one of the nation's leading gun reform advocates and a state senator who turned her viral speech into a $2.35 million boost in donations.\"If our elected leaders are not prepared to step up, show up and show the American people what we stand for, then they need to get out of the way and let another group of folks do it,\" said Bauman, the former Congressional Progressive Caucus chief.The Names Making NoiseAt the top of Bauman's person list is newly-elected Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who he says \"hears [the] message\" that voters are sending.Martin, who has spent 14 years leading the Minnesota party and eight years as a DNC vice chair, promised Democrats in his Saturday acceptance speech, \"We're going to get to work. We're going to go out there and take this fight to Donald Trump.\"Bauman is also hopeful that Artie Blanco, Malcolm Kenyatta and Jane Kleeb, who all won DNC leadership posts over the weekend, understand that the party needs to provide state and local resources more than anything else.There's also a handful of Democratic governors who appear to be ready to emerge as the voice that the party is searching for. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, for example, spent last weekend weekend bashing Trump on MSNBC and putting himself at the forefront of the so-called \"resistance.\"Asked about how he's handling Trump's retaliatory moves against blue states and cities, such as cutting off federal funding for sanctuary cities, Pritzker, who is an heir to Hyatt hotel fortune, said, \"I'm not afraid. And none of us should be afraid. We should be standing up, speaking out. We should be very clear about our messaging. And very importantly, Donald Trump is attacking working families. We are the front lines of protecting working families. We governors, right? Because we're delivering the services that people need in the states.\"Less than a week after those remarks, Trump's Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the state of Illinois for allegedly interfering with federal immigration enforcement. Nonetheless, Pritzker's stance has earned him praise from Democrats who say he's \"showing signs of rising to the moment.\" They also underscore a point Bauman made about the Democrats' power at the state level.\"That's where there is the brightest spot in the Democratic Party right now,\" Bauman said. \"We actually do have a pretty deep bench of really A-class governors, with Gretchen Whitmer at the very, very tippy top of that list.\"Whitmer, who was re-elected as the governor of Michigan against a Trump-backed candidate in 2022, remains popular in her state. In the last two weeks, she's been outspoken against Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada, which experts say could devastate Michigan's auto industry.\"Governor Whitmer is a vastly underestimated leader in the Democratic Party and the people of Michigan are very lucky to have her,\" Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris, wrote on Bluesky Wednesday. \"This is also a very high approval rating for a battleground state Governor—well deserved.\"Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut is also currying favor among liberals. Murphy, who has been a vocal gun reform advocate and often speaks of the nation's \"spiritual crisis\" of loneliness, has been reacting to the latest Trump moves in real time with his social media followers, going live to give his two cents just about every time there's a new development from the White House.\"Chris Murphy has been stepping up for sure,\" Edwards, the strategist, said in a Tuesday interview. \"God bless him. The man went on Instagram live a couple days ago, and he's trying stuff.\"Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has also successfully used her vast online network to drum up engagement among exasperated young Democratic voters. The progressive congresswoman regularly goes live to answer questions from constituents on Instagram. During her Monday livestream, she struck a tone that many progressives have been asking for.\"We have to stop playing nice in the Senate and block every damn thing that we can,\" Ocasio-Cortez said while urging Senate Democrats to block Trump's nominees. She added that the party should make the GOP \"fight for every single step. The slower they go, the less they can break.\"There are lesser-known Democrats gaining traction, too. One seasoned campaign manager pointed Newsweek to Michigan State Senator Mallory McMorrow, who he called a rising star with \"a common-sense, no bulls--t approach that cuts through noise\" in a way that \"inspires people.\"McMorrow made headlines in 2022 after she gave a viral speech defending herself against unfounded attacks from a Republican rival who accused her of being a \"groomer.\" She spoke on the opening day of the Democratic National Convention in August.The political strategist, who has advised several Democratic senators in the past, said McMorrow was a much-needed voice that countered those like Representative Jasmine Crockett and newly-elected DNC Vice Chair David Hogg — two younger progressives who he said don't \"speak to larger swaths of the party\" and often come across as \"antagonistic.\"The Elusive 'Rogan of the Left'Finding their voice is one thing. Figuring out how to communicate that voice to large swaths of the country, in an era of fractured attention spans and crumbling trust in media, is quite another.In the wake of Trump's decisive victory, after he and Vice President J.D. Vance eschewed much of the mainstream media in favor of popular male-leaning podcasts hosted by figures Joe Rogan and Theo Vonn, some liberals wondered if their party had, or would ever have, their \"own Rogan.\"\"It doesn't matter what we say, because nobody in America actually hears it,\" Bauman said. \"Nobody hears from us. We don't have the pathways to talk to people. We don't have the infrastructure set up to ensure that the message gets out.\"\"Quite frankly, we could yell whatever we want from the hills, but if our party isn't in a position to communicate it in places like West Virginia, Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, does it matter? No, it doesn't,\" he said.\"And we will always be relegated to being a second tier non-National party.\"","summary":"Democratic voters are begging their elected officials to do more in the face of the second Trump administration.

And now, it looks like Trump is one US President that China, one of US' major rivals, has been wanting for a long time, according to a Politico report. Is Donald Trump's administration taking pro-China steps?Donald Trump's Presidential administration in the last two weeks has reportedly done everything it could have to give China enough room to strengthen itself, while weakening America's position in the world, even among its allies who have stood by the United States for years, according to Politico. Just as Beijing was facing economic headwinds, President Trump's recent administrative decisions may have given China the opportunity to solidify its stand as a rival of the US, and develop terms with countries that Trump has threatened war against. However, Trump's aides are of the opinion that he has taken stern steps against Beijing, including the implementation of new tariffs on Chinese imports. They are also of the opinion that the steps being taken by the reining US President are in the long term interest of America, the results of which could be seen after some years, if one is interested to see the bigger picture. FAQs:Is Donald Trump the new US President? Yes, Donald Trump is currently the new US President after taking over from Joe Biden.

He's [Luca] not like that, he wouldn't entertain something he didn't want to.'\nGrace was partnered with Joey, 33, for six days after he dumped Samantha Kenny to be with her. Grace and Joey already knew each other as they briefly dated in 2023.\nJoey then left Grace to get with Jessy Potts - sneaking to the terrace to kiss her and leaving lasting animosity between himself and Grace.\nThis instilled a worry in the blonde beauty as she did not want to relive that experience.\n\nJoey and Grace were seemingly building a strong connection in the villa but his head was turned by fellow bombshell Jessy (pictured)\n\nAnd now after Grace and her new flame Luca had their biggest fight yet, Joey has made his feelings about them clear as he commented on Love Island's clip of the tiff\n\nUnderneath the fiery post which mentioned his name, Joey posted a shocked emoji.\nIn the episode, Grace asked Luca not to kiss bombshell Samie after she made it clear she was interested in only him when she entered the villa.\nLater that evening during a tense game of spin the bottle truth or dare, it was Luca's turn and he was dared to kiss the Islander - other than who he was coupled up - that was most his type.\nDespite his prior conversation with Grace, Luca walked around the firepit and snogged Samie - much to the dismay of his furious partner.\nLuca walked away from the firepit after the very awkward kiss and a fiery conversation which saw Grace telling him to shut up.\nCurtis Pritchard followed him to which Luca admitted: 'It's my actions that have put me in this'\nGrace was left furious telling Tina: 'I'm fuming…the person he decides to kiss is her [Samie]. I told you it would make me feel uncomfortable'.\nShe continued: 'Don't ask me who I feel you should pick, just pick who you want to pick and do not ask me….it's double p****d me off now that you've asked me a question and ignored it.'\nIn the hope of smoothing things over, Luca later pulled Grace for a chat, he said: 'I just wanna say I'm sorry, I know what I said before and it's not fair that I went and did something different… my actions were different to what I said.'\nGrace added: 'I don't get why you did any of that...don't ask me a question and then go against it when you know that she [Samie] is finding any little leeway to get in between me and you.'\nLuca said: 'I'm gonna go speak to her in a minute', prompting Grace to reply: 'Go and speak to her then' before storming off.\nLater that evening, the islanders received a text asking for all of them all to gather around the firepit.\n\nDuring Wednesday's episode, Grace and Luca's romance hit rock bottom after Luca appeared to have his head turned by bombshell Sammie Elishi\nSamie and Chuggs were sent into panic as they stood up hoping to choose who they recouple with but in a plot twist, the decision was been taken out of the pair's hands.\nThe text reads: 'As the newest arrivals it’s time to couple up, but who you couple up with won’t be your decision…that decision is down to the public.'\nSamie was coupled up with Luca and Chuggs was coupled up with Danielle Sellers.\nLove Island All Stars continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2 and ITVX.\nLuca BishJoey Essex\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJoey Essex breaks his silence on ex Grace Jackson's row with new man Luca Bish after his name is dragged into their spat on Love Island: All Stars\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nLauryn Goodman 'will move to Italy NEXT WEEK' as she follows footballer Kyle Walker abroad amid his marital woes with Annie Kilner\n\nBianca Censori reveals how she really felt about controversial naked red carpet stunt as Kanye West boasts that he and wife'beat the Grammys'\n\nCelebrity chef Gino D'Acampo hit with multiple allegations of 'sexually inappropriate and intimidating behaviour' over 12-year period\n\nMOLLY CLAYTON: Lottie Moss has branded me 'jealous' after I revealed our encounter from hell.

Adding onto that, he also denies numerous claims that the former US Vice President Kamala Harris's team conducted a walk through of his studio.Joe Rogan reportedly made claims that he originally hoped to air both the important interviews on the same day but that former US Vice President Kamala Harris's team offered a tightly controlled interview in Washington DC after US President Donald Trump's appearance attracted 50 million views, asserted New York Post. Also, he now says that the team of Kamala Harris requested staff members and a stenographer to be present and expressed severe concerns about the podcast being edited which he eventually found extremely unreasonable compared to US President Donald Trump's no conditions appearance.Joe Rogan eventually also suggests some internal disagreements within the team of former US Vice President Kamala Harris and severe concerns about ‘bad optics’ from ‘wokesters’ might have played a huge role in the interview falling through, noted New York Post. During recent tines, he also asserted that he has also the evidence to back his claims and that the book's authors never at all contacted him for his side of the story.

A new addition to our little family and some very exciting years ahead.

The moment Alba and her sister meet is gunna be so emotional. I've been watching so many other parents videos of their babies meeting for the first time and I'm in FLOODS of tears.'\n\nJust days before she was due to give birth, Charlotte opened up about her love for her daughter , while also revealing the sweet reason why she couldn't wait for her pregnancy to be over\n\nAs she headed for the final stretch ahead of becoming a mother-of-two, Charlotte told how her excitement levels for finally giving birth were 'through the roof' \nIt comes after Charlotte revealed she would be having planned C-section as she finds it 'too hard to push a baby out' as she opened up about her second pregnancy last month.\nCharlotte admitted she does not want to feel 'out of control' during child birth and has 'absolutely no desire to push' as she explained why she has booked for a C-section.\nSpeaking to new! magazine, she said: 'I would always only have a C-section I have absolutely no desire to push a baby out of my vagina as it is too hard.\n'I had a C-section with Alba and it was such a good experience I like to be in control especially after my ectopic pregnancy [in 2016].\n'Waking up from that operation and being told I almost died and lost two reproductive organs was awful. I never want to feel out of control like that again.'\nThe birth has also been filmed for Charlotte's reality show, Geordie Shore: Charlotte's Having Another Baby.\nThe TV personality previously admitted she couldn't wait for her pregnancy to be over as she had a hard time during her final trimester.\nShe added: 'I'm just surviving at this point. I'm so ready to have this baby now, I can't wait I've been throwing up all morning.'\n\nIt comes after Charlotte revealed she would be having planned C-section as she finds it 'too hard to push a baby out' as she opened up about her second pregnancy last month\n\nCharlotte admitted she does not want to feel 'out of control' during child birth and has 'absolutely no desire to push' as she explained why she has booked for a C-section (pictured in November)\nCharlotte had an ectopic pregnancy back in 2016 which left her fearing she would never be able to have kids.\nAn ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg implants itself outside of the womb, usually in the fallopian tube, meaning a baby is unable to develop and leaving the mother's health in danger.\nShe said: 'I hadn't ever felt pain like this and couldn't take anymore. I told Kate [a friend] to cancel the doctor, I need to go to the hospital, this is something worse than period pain.'\nShe said she found out she was pregnant after giving a urine sample and said of the moment: 'I was in shock, and when Kate said 'Congratulations!' I said no no no, this is bad.'\nCharlotte told how her heart sank as she knew it was something serious and recalls crying and panicking whether she could ever have a baby in the future.\n'I found out my fallopian tube had completely ruptured, and the doctor had to remove my left fallopian tube and an ovary,' she said.\nDuring her second pregnancy, Charlotte and fiancé Jake were also subjected to an armed burglary at their £1 million Sunderland mansion back in November last year.\nAnd her upcoming four-part Paramount+ series will include the aftermath of the terrifying incident.\n\nThe birth has also been filmed for Charlotte's reality show, Geordie Shore : Charlotte's Having Another Baby \nCharlotte exclusively told MailOnline: 'There's lots of things that have happened over the past few months that are quite heavily featured, which I've never spoken about at all, because obviously it's police matters.\n'But the burglary, everything like that, the show was there. Do you know what I mean?\n'But I've never spoke about that with anyone. I've not answered any interview questions. It's a police matter like as it stands.\n'But basically, the show was with us 24/7, whilst all this was going on. So there's lots - there's so much in every single episode and there's only four episodes. So like, you're kind of not going to want it to end.'\nAfter such a scary ordeal, when asked about if she felt nervous about opening her home up for the world to see on the TV, she admitted that it did make her 'rethink' her decision.\nCharlotte admitted: 'I've been in that house for a decade, and it's been on TV all the way through them 10 years.\n'I think, after it happened, it definitely made us rethink like how much of the house I should really be showing. Now I've got children.\n'And so it definitely made us rethink a lot of things, having a lot of conversations and just like, thinking about a lot.\n\nCharlotte's fiancé Jake shared the terrifying news on his Instagram Story\n\n'Yeah, I definitely think, not necessarily nervous... But definitely rethinking like, maybe the future.'\n\n Charlotte Crosby reveals the name of her adorable baby girl with fiancé Jake Ankers \nCharlotte was heavily pregnant with her unborn daughter when a gang of balaclava-masked raiders entered her home.\nDays later Charlotte gave fans an update on her social media, confessing that it left her 'living in fear'.\nShe told her fans on Instagram: 'I now have the BEST security in the northeast with man guards, security dogs and 24/7 surveillance.'\nThe star added: 'I've been living in fear since last week. Not feeling safe in your own home with small children is really something else.\n'I've been trying my hardest to put what happened out of my head! And I'm sorry for being on here!\n'It's just took some time dealing with everything that's gone on and then I was in hospital!'\nCharlotte CrosbyInstagramGeordie Shore\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nCharlotte Crosby shares update on her C-section recovery as she reveals more birth details and adorable new snap of newborn daughter Pixi\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nLauryn Goodman 'will move to Italy NEXT WEEK' as she follows footballer Kyle Walker abroad amid his marital woes with Annie Kilner\n\nBianca Censori reveals how she really felt about controversial naked red carpet stunt as Kanye West boasts that he and wife'beat the Grammys'\n\nCelebrity chef Gino D'Acampo hit with multiple allegations of 'sexually inappropriate and intimidating behaviour' over 12-year period\n\nMOLLY CLAYTON: Lottie Moss has branded me 'jealous' after I revealed our encounter from hell.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy HANNAH MCDONALD \n Published:19:53 GMT, 6 February 2025 |Updated:20:10 GMT, 6 February 2025 \n\nLove Island: All Stars podcast host Amy Hart has been forced to skip out on her presenting duties due to a three-week sickness, she has revealed.\nThe reality star, 31, appeared on the fifth series of Love Island whens he was famously coupled up with All Stars' Curtis Pritchard. \nShe has since taken on hosting duties on the show's podcast, The Morning After, alongside fellow ex-Love Islander Indiya Pollack.\nHowever Amy revealed this week that she would be stepping back from episodes as a result of sickness - though said she hoped to return swiftly. \nTaking to her Instagram Story, Amy said: 'No podcast for me this evening after three weeks of 'pushing through because surely I'll have to get better at some point, I can't be ill forever?! I've realised I'm never going to get better if I don't rest.\n'I had a half day reprieve on Monday where I thought I was better but then on the way home, I thought my throat felt a bit sore. \n\nLove Island: All Stars podcast host Amy Hart has been forced to skip out on her presenting duties due to a three-week sickness, she has revealed\n\nThe reality star (Seen in November), 31, appeared on the fifth series of Love Island whens he was famously coupled up with All Stars' Curtis Pritchard\n'I've now got swollen glands, earache and swing between being dripping in sweat and being so cold I'm shivering in a thermal base layer, big thick jumper, huge duvet and a blanket.'\n'I'm hoping if I can sleep for a 12 hours tonight, I'll be back tomorrow,' Amy added.\nJust four days ago, Amy spoke about her illness as she shared a collection of snaps from the podcast.\nShe wrote: 'January was mainly spent behind the desk discussing some AllStars! Apologies but also thanks to everyone who has endured listening to me struggle to breathe for the last 2 weeks.\n'My Nan said to me today \"I watched it the other day and I’m not being funny Amy, you looked very unwell.\" Thanks hun! \n'Great news is I can breathe again today so hopefully a better watch and listen from tomorrow!!'\nIt comes after her ex Curtis, who is currently coupled up with Cülcüloğlu on Love Island: All Stars, revealed he was 'excited' to reunite with her once he leaves the villa ahead of his stint. \nAmy, who is now happily married to husband Sam Rason who she shares a child with, and Curtis famously went through a very awkward break-up during series five of the show back in 2019.\n\nShe has since taken on hosting duties on the show's podcast, The Morning After, alongside fellow ex-Love Islander Indiya Pollack\n\nTaking to her Instagram Story, Amy said: 'No podcast for me this evening after three weeks of 'pushing through because surely I'll have to get better at some point, I can't be ill forever?! I've realised I'm never going to get better if I don't rest'\n\nTheir dramatic on-screen split was came after Curtis admitted to having his head turned by model Jourdan Riane in Casa Amour, with Amy later questioning whether he really liked her at all.\nHowever, six years on from the onscreen breakdown of their relationship, Curtis, 28, has reflected on that tense time for the former couple as he told how there was more to that Casa Amor situation that viewers didn't realise.\nSpeaking to press ahead of his stint in the South Africa villa, Curtis opened up about potentially coming back into contact with Amy, 32, seeing as she co-presents the Love Island: The Morning After podcast which regularly chats to dumped islanders.\nGushing about his ex, he said: 'Amy's awesome, I love Amy! She's smashing it. She's doing absolutely unbelievable, all the jobs that she's doing, she's got the podcast, this and that. She's got a kid now, she's she's rocking it. \n'So you know what? It would be a really cool reunion and we'll probably end up going out for food after and stuff. So I'm a bit excited for that.'\nThe dancer also defended his treatment of Amy when asked if he learned anything from the public break-up, as he insisted that he didn't properly get the chance to tell her how he was feeling at the time. \n\nSpeaking ahead of his All Star appearance, he admitted: 'In hindsight, if I do find a girl this time, I will perhaps cuddle her in bed rather than make coffee… so Amy taught me a lesson'\n\nAmy is now married to Sam Rason after the pair tied the knot in Spain last September, a year after announcing their engagement. The couple also share son Stanley, 22 months \n\nCurtis famously left Amy reeling when she discovered that ahead of recoupling with her, he'd shown an interest in pursuing Jourdan who he met in Casa Amor.\nA devastated Amy then informed him that she had been gearing up to confess her love to him. \nDiscussing the drama, Curtis explained: 'I think with that whole Amy situation is there's a Casa Amor bit that we're maybe all forgetting about where you're not able to talk to the other half there. So it changes the reality of things ever so slightly. \n'Because my one goal when that Casa Amor thing happened was I wanted to be able to talk to Amy and let her know how I'm feeling. \n'You can't do that in that scenario, so there's not anything I can learn or change from that too much really.\n'It's a bit of a tricky one there. So no, I feel like I'm normally, touch wood, most of the time very respectful. I try to be anyway.'\nCurtis PritchardAmy Hart\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLove Island: All Stars host is forced to miss show amid three-week sickness as she reveals she was left 'dripping in sweat'\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nLauryn Goodman 'will move to Italy NEXT WEEK' as she follows footballer Kyle Walker abroad amid his marital woes with Annie Kilner\n\nBianca Censori reveals how she really felt about controversial naked red carpet stunt as Kanye West boasts that he and wife'beat the Grammys'\n\nCelebrity chef Gino D'Acampo hit with multiple allegations of 'sexually inappropriate and intimidating behaviour' over 12-year period\n\nMOLLY CLAYTON: Lottie Moss has branded me 'jealous' after I revealed our encounter from hell.

Now, I understand it may be hard to keep up with all of the reality TV coming out right now — especially with Bravo airing shows like Southern Charm, Southern Hospitality, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, and The Real Housewives of Potomac all at once. But there’s no reason why we can’t throw one more into the mix. After all, they are the Kardashians! Check out our full review of the Season 6 premiere episode below: \n\nTHE KARDASHIANS – SEASON 6: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?\n\nOpening Shot: The Kardashians Season 6 starts with Kris and her daughters, sans Kylie, hanging out at their Malibu beach house after finishing up a poolside photoshoot.\n\nThe Gist: Reality TV’s royal family is back. In the Season 6 premiere of The Kardashians, Kourtney celebrates her birthday at IHOP, Khloé looks toward the next decade of her life by shedding her past, Kris attempts to hijack her daughters’ new agent, and Kim is as busy as ever as she prepares for the Met Gala, the Tom Brady roast, and visits the White House to speak on criminal justice reform.\n\nWhat Shows Will This Remind You Of? The Kardashians will remind you of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the family’s original reality show that ran on E! from 2007 to 2021. The show has the same big personalities and the same glamorous lifestyle with a little more focus on their business ventures and a little less on their drama.\n\nOur Take: To be completely honest, I’ve gone into the last few seasons wondering what else these ladies could possibly have up their sleeves. But I was ultimately proven wrong when Season 4 kicked off with an explosive feud between Kim and Kourtney — and then Season 5 showed off Kourtney’s pregnancy journey with little Rocky Barker. Fortunately, Season 6 is no different when it comes to drama and excitement. While I’d love to say former Vice President Kamala Harris was the most surprising guest star, I think Khloé reuniting with her ex-husband Lamar Odom for the first time in nearly a decade was what truly had me shook.\n\nTheir reunion was awkward yet bittersweet, making for one of the most emotional episodes since Khloé found out Tristan Thompson was fathering another woman’s baby at the same time their surrogate was pregnant. Khloé remembered times of true love and others of betrayal in her confessionals, while Lamar struggled to maintain eye-contact with his ex-wife after everything he had put her through during their marriage. The look of shock and excitement on his face when he realized she saved some of his most prized possessions proved that Khloé truly was the one who got away and had it not been for Lamar’s drug addiction, they very well could still be together. Overall, their meeting felt like one big nostalgia trip for OG Keeping Up with the Kardashians fans — and we can’t wait to see how it all unfolds in next week’s episode.\n\nSex and Skin: Nope, there’s no sex and skin.\n\nParting Shot: The episode ends with Lamar professing his undying love for Khloé, despite everything he put her through with his cheating scandals and 2015 drug overdose. \n\nSleeper Star: The Kardashian clan should be thanking Malika Haqq for making this premiere episode what it was. If it weren’t for her emotional run-in with Lamar at the Super Bowl, Khloé never would’ve been inspired to reunite with him. \n\nMost Pilot-y Line: “I’m just spiraling.” Kim says this as her wig is falling off and her boobs are boobing too much moments before she’s set to meet Harris at the White House. Not only did the line perfectly encapsulate the chaos that ensued before their meeting, but it also was a great way to describe Khloé’s mixed feelings about reuniting with her ex-husband later on in the episode.\n\nOur Call: STREAM IT. After nearly 20 years of sharing their lives with the world, the Kardashian-Jenner family still manages to find ways to keep themselves relevant and entertaining.","summary":"Reality TV's royal family is back.","url":"https://decider.com/2025/02/06/the-kardashians-season-6-hulu-review/","image":"https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/kardashians.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Qo2Q8rLi-QVS3bn7S.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-06 20:00:00","author":"mliss1578,Samantha Nungesser","authors":["mliss1578","Samantha Nungesser"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.045},{"id":287859652,"title":"Trump Is Flat-Out Lying About the 60 Minutes Interview With Harris","text":"CBS has finally released the full transcript of the interview with Kamala Harris that 60 Minutes aired on October 7, which provoked a lawsuit that Donald Trump filed against the network a few weeks later. The same interview is also the focus of an investigation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which has the power to nix a pending merger between Paramount, the network's owner, and Skydance Media by declining to approve the transfer of broadcast licenses.\n\nAfter the interview aired, Trump, then the Republican presidential nominee facing off against Harris in the 2024 election, described it as \"Election Interference,\" an \"UNPRECEDENTED SCANDAL,\" and \"a giant Fake News Scam\" that was \"totally illegal.\" By editing the interview to make Harris \"look better,\" he said, CBS had committed an offense so egregious that the FCC should \"TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE\" (by which he presumably meant the broadcast licenses held by CBS-owned stations). The transcript confirms what you may have suspected: Trump's characterization of the interview is completely bonkers. It is Trump, not CBS, who is perpetrating \"a giant Fake News Scam.\"\n\nIt was already clear that the editing of the interview did not constitute consumer fraud, as Trump alleges in his lawsuit, or \"broadcast news distortion\"—the claim that the FCC is considering. But the transcript also makes it clear, beyond any serious dispute, that CBS did not commit any journalistic sins when it presented an edited version of Harris' response to a question about Israel.\n\nThe transcript validates the network's argument that it was engaging in standard journalistic practice by using a more \"succinct\" segment of Harris' response to the Israel question than the one that was featured in a preview on Face the Nation the day before. And it shows that Trump has not only absurdly exaggerated what happened (as is his wont); he has flagrantly misrepresented the nature of the editing and continues to do so.\n\n\"CBS and 60 Minutes defrauded the public by doing something which has never, to this extent, been seen before,\" Trump averred on X today. \"They 100% removed Kamala's horrible election changing answers to questions, and replaced them with completely different, and far better, answers, taken from another part of the interview. This was Election changing 'stuff,' Election Interference and, quite simply, Election Fraud at a level never seen before. CBS should lose its license, and the cheaters at 60 Minutes should all be thrown out, and this disreputable 'NEWS' show should be immediately terminated….This will go down as the biggest Broadcasting SCANDAL in History!!!\"\n\nThe idea that making Harris seem a bit more cogent (or less \"CRAZY\" and \"DUMB,\" as Trump put it in October) could have been \"election changing\" was always silly, all the more so in light of Trump's victory, which was by no means close in the Electoral College. But Trump is simply lying when he says 60 Minutes \"replaced\" Harris' answer with a \"completely different\" answer \"taken from another part of the interview.\"\n\nWhen correspondent Bill Whitaker suggested that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was \"not listening\" to the Biden administration's concerns about the war in Gaza and had \"rebuffed just about all of your administration's entreaties,\" here is how Harris responded:\n\nWell, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. And we're not going to stop doing that. We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.\n\nThe Face the Nation promo used the first sentence, while the interview as aired on 60 Minutes used the last sentence. In other words, the latter show's producers were telling the truth when they said they had used the \"same question\" and the \"same answer\" but \"a different portion of the response.\"\n\nHarris did not come across as especially forthright, articulate, or intelligent in either version, although the one that 60 Minutes showed was a little more concise. This is what Trump thinks (or claims to think) amounted to \"a giant Fake News Scam\" and \"the biggest Broadcasting SCANDAL in History.\"\n\nAfter Trump sued CBS, the network insisted that \"the interview was not doctored\" and noted that 60 Minutes \"did not hide any part of Vice President Kamala Harris's answer to the question at issue.\" After all, Trump was aware of this supposed \"SCANDAL\" only because CBS aired both parts of her response. The full transcript removes any doubt about who is telling the truth in this case and who is just making shit up.\n\nTrump's lawsuit claims that CBS \"cross[ed] the line from the exercise of judgment in reporting to deceitful, deceptive manipulation of news.\" Even if that were true, it would not qualify as consumer fraud under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, as the lawsuit asserts, for reasons I explained in detail last week. Trump did not suffer any cognizable damages under that statute, let alone damages amounting to \"at least\" $10 billion, as he risibly claims.\n\nIn fact, however, CBS did not engage in \"deceitful, deceptive manipulation of news,\" which means it cannot possibly be guilty of broadcast news distortion, which requires \"evidence showing that the broadcast news report was deliberately intended to mislead viewers or listeners.\" When the FCC rejected that claim last month, Jessica Rosenworcel, its Biden-appointed chairwoman, rightly said \"the FCC should not be the President's speech police\" or \"journalism's censor-in-chief.\" But her Trump-appointed replacement, Brendan Carr, whose avowed dedication to freedom of speech and freedom of the press is curiously selective, revived the complaint and has indicated that it will figure in the FCC's review of the deal between Paramount and Skydance.\n\nCarr's interest in reconsidering the frivolous complaint against CBS in this context is a chilling illustration of how executive power can be abused in service of the president's personal vendettas. It helps explain why Paramount is keen to appease Trump by settling his laughable lawsuit, which CBS accurately described as \"completely without merit.\"\n\nThe FCC complaint is equally groundless. As Nathan Simington, another Trump-appointed FCC commissioner, noted in October, \"broadcast news distortion is an extraordinarily narrow complaint category.\" He added that \"CBS could easily remove the predicate for any further discussion by releasing the transcript\" of the Harris interview. Carr himself said something similar around the same time. \"In my view,\" he told Glenn Beck, \"the best way forward\" would be to \"release the transcript,\" which would mean \"there's no reason to have this before the FCC.\"\n\nNow that CBS has released the transcript, it should be obvious to Carr that 60 Minutes did nothing close to intentional misrepresentation or deliberate distortion of the news. But in truth, there was \"no reason to have this before the FCC\" at all. Based on the constitutionally dubious distinction between broadcast journalism and journalism in every other medium, the commission is second-guessing editorial judgments that are indisputably protected by the First Amendment, even when they are sloppy, mistaken, irresponsible, or unethical—none of which is true in this case.\n\nThe FCC is scrutinizing CBS at the behest of a vindictive president who reflexively alleges nonexistent torts, crimes, or regulatory violations based on news coverage he views as unfair to him. Trump's petty, wildly hyperbolic grievances do not deserve a respectful hearing from any rational person, let alone from a government agency with the power to punish news outlets for journalism that irks him.","summary":"The full transcript shows the president's complaints about the editing of the interview are not just wildly hyperbolic and legally groundless. They are demonstrably false.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/02/06/trump-is-flat-out-lying-about-the-60-minutes-interview-with-harris/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/02/Kamala-Harris-60-Minutes-interview.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 19:40:17","author":"Jacob Sullum","authors":["Jacob Sullum"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.414},{"id":287830578,"title":"Lily Allen hints at her first music in seven years as she returns to work following marriage collapse and stay at £8,000 per week trauma centre","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Feb 6th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLauryn Goodman 'will move to Italy NEXT WEEK' as she follows footballer Kyle Walker abroad amid his marital woes with Annie Kilner\n\nHorror as families reveal they aborted their healthy babies after medics WRONGLY said they had serious genetic conditions: Police investigating NHS Trust\n\nFury at Labour as BoE cuts interest rates in desperate bid to revive economy - halving growth forecast in wake of disastrous Budget\n\nCelebrity chef Gino D'Acampo hit with multiple allegations of 'sexually inappropriate and intimidating behaviour' over 12-year period\n\nI thought my bigger belly was middle-aged spread - before I was diagnosed with a rare cancer.

It's got out of control, I've tried.\n'I came to the Miss Me? Christmas lunch and had a panic attack and had to go home and I went to see something at the theatre the other night with my friends Carla and Claire and I had to leave at half time.\n'I can't concentrate on anything except the pain I'm going through. It's really hard.'\nWhen asked if it was easier now her daughters are older, she said: 'Yeah, we are a support network for each other and encourage each other to talk about or feelings, but I think the main thing is telling them we're going to get through it and be fine.'\n\nIt was reported last month that the singer checked herself in after telling friends she was close to a nervous breakdown following her break-up from Harbour (pictured together in 2022)\nShe added: 'I'm going away next week for a few weeks, listeners. But I do want to reassure people because there will be speculation because of the amount of time I'm going to be taking away that I'm going to drug rehab - I've not, I've not relapsed.\n'I have seen some horrible blind items on the internet that I was found in a crack den by my husband being surrounded by men. I don't know who is spreading these vicious rumours but it's not true.\n'It all comes back to the phones. They aren't doing us any good. They certainly aren't doing me any good at the moment. I really don't like my phone.\n'I'm as guilty of that as anyone else, what I'm very excited about where I'm going over the next few weeks is that I'm not allowed my phone.'\nJessie JLily AllenRayaLondonKaty Perry\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLily Allen hints at her first music in seven years as she returns to work following marriage collapse and stay at £8,000 per week trauma centre\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nCelebrity chef Gino D'Acampo hit with multiple allegations of 'sexually inappropriate and intimidating behaviour' over 12-year period\n\nLauryn Goodman 'will move to Italy NEXT WEEK' as she follows footballer Kyle Walker abroad amid his marital woes with Annie Kilner\n\nBianca Censori reveals how she really felt about controversial naked red carpet stunt as Kanye West boasts that he and wife'beat the Grammys'\n\nMOLLY CLAYTON: Lottie Moss has branded me 'jealous' after I revealed our encounter from hell.

Gavin Newsom of California has long been a leading adversary, and target, of President Donald Trump. But the governor of the nation's most populous state, one of the Democratic Party's leaders in the resistance against the second Trump administration and a potential White House contender in 2028, is leaving politics aside as he feverishly works to secure more federal assistance for people and businesses devastated by last month's deadly wildfires in metropolitan Los Angeles. \"Thank you, President Trump, for coming to our communities to see this firsthand and meeting with me today to continue our joint efforts to support people impacted,\" Newsom said in a statement on Wednesday evening after his huddle with the president at the White House. In a video posted on social medial, the governor said, \"So, here at the White House. Just finished a meeting with President Trump. Had a very successful day up on Capitol Hill as well, meeting in a bipartisan manner with Republican and Democratic leaders about disaster aid and disaster recovery for people impacted by the fires in Southern California.\" FRENEMIES: NEWSOM COMES HAT IN HAND TO MEET TRUMP AT WHITE HOUSE Newsom described his meetings with Trump and members of Congress as \"the spirit of collaboration and cooperation … defined.\" The governor's trip was his first to Washington, D.C., since Trump took over in the White House and is part of his effort to secure additional federal funding to aid in wildfire recovery from the destructive blazes that killed 29 people, destroyed over 12,000 homes and forced tens of thousands to evacuate. TRUMP MEETS WITH CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS, FIRE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TO SEE LA WILDFIRE DAMAGE FIRST HAND Late last month, the governor approved $2.5 billion for fire recovery work, which he hopes will be reimbursed by the federal government. And the state will likely need much more help from the federal government because the bill to cover rebuilding costs is expected to reach into the tens of billions of dollars. Newsom, after his meeting with Trump and his crisscrossing of Capitol Hill, emphasized that \"we continue to cut red tape to speed up recovery and cleanup efforts as well as ensure rebuilding efforts are swift. We’re working across the aisle, as we always have, to ensure survivors have the resources and support they need.\" Relations between Newsom and Trump haven't always been so harmonious. Their animosity dates back to before Trump was elected president the first time in 2016, when Newsom was California's lieutenant governor. NEWSOM CALLS TRUMP'S CLAIMS 'PURE FICTION' AFTER HE POINTED FINGER OVER CALIFORNIA FIRE TRAGEDY And while they did seek common ground at times during Trump's first term in the White House, the verbal fireworks resumed over the past two years as Newsom served as a top surrogate on the campaign trail for former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced Biden as the Democrats' 2024 standard-bearer last summer. Newsom regularly criticized Trump, and the former and future president handily returned the favor, treating Newsom and heavily blue California as a political punching bag. After Trump's convincing election victory over Harris in November, Newsom moved to \"Trump-proof\" his heavily blue state. \"He is using the term ‘Trump-Proof’ as a way of stopping all of the GREAT things that can be done to ‘Make California Great Again,’ but I just overwhelmingly won the Election,\" Trump responded. But Newsom followed through, and earlier this week, California lawmakers approved $25 million in legal funding proposed by the Democratic governor to challenge actions by the Trump administration. And the legislature also allocated another $25 million for legal groups to defend undocumented immigrants facing possible deportation by new Trump administration efforts. After the outbreak of the fires early last month, Trump repeatedly criticized Newsom's handling of the crisis. He has accused the governor of mismanaging forestry and water policy and, pointing to intense backlash over a perceived lack of preparation, called on Newsom to step down. \"Gavin Newscum should resign. This is all his fault!!!\" Trump charged in a social media post Jan. 8, repeating a derogatory name he often labels the governor. Trump also placed blame for the deadly wildfires on Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, another Democrat, and the policies approved by state lawmakers. In an executive order issued last month, he described management of the state's land and water resources as \"disastrous.\" Newsom pushed back. Disputing Trump, the governor noted that reservoirs in the southern part of California were full when the fires first sparked, and he has argued that no amount of water could tackle fires fueled by winds of up to 100 miles per hour. Newsom also claimed Trump spread \"hurricane-force winds of mis- and disinformation.\" But when Trump arrived in Los Angeles late last month to survey the first damage — just four days after his inauguration as president — the governor greeted him at the airport. \"Thank you first for being here. It means a great deal to all of us,\" Newsom told Trump as he greeted the president upon his arrival in Los Angeles last month. \"We’re going to need your support. We’re going to need your help.\" The president declared that \"we're looking to get something completed. And the way you get it completed is to work together.\" Ahead of his stop in Los Angeles, Trump had threatened to withhold wildfire aid until certain stipulations were met in California, including changes to water policy and requiring an ID to vote. \"It wasn't discussed, and I hope we can move beyond that,\" Newsom said Thursday when asked in a CNN interview about any conditions for federal aid Trump may have demanded. \"Some of the conditions that were being bandied about just seemed to be, for me, a little bit of noise, a little bit political. At the end of the day, we're all in this together.\" Newsom has also stepped back in recent weeks in pushing back against Trump's zingers. Following Trump's orders, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers last week opened two dams in Central California, letting roughly 2.2 billion gallons of water flow out of reservoirs. Trump celebrated the move in posts on Truth Social Friday and Sunday, declaring, \"the water is flowing in California,\" and adding the water was \"heading to farmers throughout the State, and to Los Angeles.\" But water experts argued that the newly released water won't flow to Los Angeles, and it is being wasted by being released during California's normally wet winter season. Newsom, apparently aiming to rebuild the working relationship he had with Trump during the president's first term in the White House, didn't raise any objections to the water release. \"For Newsom, it's not just the last disaster, it's the next one. Because when you are governor of California, you know in the not too distant future there will be more wildfires, or floods or earthquakes, and he's going to need help from the federal government,\" Jack Pitney, a veteran California-based political scientist at Claremont McKenna College, emphasized. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Pitney argued that \"whatever [Newsom] thinks about Trump, he needs the president's help.\" But looking ahead, he noted that Newsom is \"termed out in two years. So, once he's no longer governor, he can be as partisan and anti-Trump as he wants. But, for now, that has to be on hold.\"","summary":"California Gov.

From now on, women's sports will be only for women,\" Trump said at the signing ceremony, standing at a podium flanked by female athletes. \"With this executive order, the war on women's sports is over.\"\n\nIn his speech, Trump emphasized the effect on K-12 schools and colleges and universities -- which receive federal student aid and federal funds through certain programs, such as free and reduced lunch and special education services -- and are subject to Title IX, the law designed to prevent gender discrimination in education.\n\n\"We are putting every school receiving taxpayer dollars on notice that if you let men take over women's sports teams or invade your locker rooms, you will be investigated for violations of Title IX and risk your federal funding. There will be no federal funding,\" he said.\n\nArkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin, who attended the signing ceremony, applauded the executive order.\n\n\"Girls deserve the opportunity to enjoy athletic competition without competing with biological men,\" Griffin told ESPN in a statement. \"This executive order is an important step toward that goal, and I look forward to working with the Trump administration to ensure that our girls and women have every opportunity guaranteed to them under Title IX.\"\n\nWhile Trump's comments and much of the discussion leading up to the signing Wednesday focused on athletes in schools, the executive order reached far beyond that scope, extending to sport governing bodies and associations, foreign athletes coming to the United States, and the International Olympic Committee.\n\nShiwali Patel, a senior director with the National Women's Law Center, which opposed the ban, said she \"didn't expect that [the order] would be this sweeping in impact.\"\n\n\"It seems like they were throwing in anything they could to really broadly ensure that their attack reached every level of sport,\" she said. \"It's using this broad civil rights law as a weapon and turning it on its head to require discrimination against an already vulnerable group of students.\"\n\nBeth Parlato, senior legal adviser with the Independent Women's Forum, one of the groups advocating for the ban, said that while the order clearly covers sports teams at schools and colleges, its broader language communicates that, \"it is the policy of the United States to not allow men to play in women's sports.\"\n\n\"I believe that other organizations will follow suit,\" she said.\n\nThe executive order raises questions about which athletes and sporting organizations are impacted, as well as how the government will enforce its policy. Here's what we know.\n\nWho is affected by this?\n\nThe number of transgender athletes competing in K-12 sports is unknown. But in multiple states that have debated this type of legislation, the numbers of known transgender girls competing in girls' sports have been in the single digits, sometimes just one, as was the case in Utah, Kentucky and Ohio.\n\nAt the NCAA level, president Charlie Baker said at a congressional hearing in December that fewer than 10 NCAA athletes used the association's transgender athlete eligibility policy. More than 530,000 athletes compete in the NCAA.\n\nIn response to the order, the NCAA on Thursday issued a new policy limiting competition in women's sports to student-athletes assigned female at birth only. \"This national standard brings much needed clarity as we modernize college sports for today's student-athletes,\" Baker said in a statement.\n\nAdditionally, the order directs White House officials to convene \"representatives of major athletic organizations and governing bodies\" to \"promote\" policies in line with its policy. These entities are not subject to Title IX.\n\nGriffin, the Arkansas attorney general, said the order does not apply to privately owned sports leagues and clubs. \"But I applaud President Trump for leading on this issue and sending a clear message to athletic leagues at all levels that the American people want fairness for girls and women in sports,\" he said.\n\nVirginia Attorney General Jason Miyares agreed that the order would not apply to athletes in programs that did not receive federal funding. He said an example of an association that would need to comply is the Virginia High School League, which is a private, nonprofit organization whose members are public and private high schools.\n\nParlato said she didn't see the order applying to youth organizations such as the town soccer team or hockey club because so many of those are small enough that they're already coed.\n\nStill, the wide-ranging language in the executive order has left some private organizations wondering whether they must comply. Karen Kauffman, senior director of global programs with the Women's Flat Track Derby Association, said the association has welcomed transgender athletes. The association represents 412 leagues and 20,000 skaters worldwide, with 75% in the U.S. Teams are typically not associated with schools or colleges; the association does not receive federal funding; and roller derby is not part of the Olympic movement in the U.S., Kauffman said.\n\n\"It's hard for us to even grasp how this will impact us. It will be harmful to our sport. We have a progressive, open-gender policy that the government now disagrees with,\" Kauffman said. \"What does this mean?\"\n\nKauffman said the new rules restricting transgender athletes from foreign countries would have an impact. She said the uncertainty prompted the league at the end of last year to choose Sweden instead of the U.S. as the host country for its 2026 global championships.\n\n\"For now we operate as usual,\" she added. \"We have to again see how this plays out legally.\"\n\nThe order also calls on the United Nations and International Olympic Committee to adopt policies in line with the order. It directs the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to work to prevent \"males seeking to participate in women's sports\" from entering the U.S. by using laws designed to deny visas to foreign visitors.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the executive order is part of a \"very public pressure campaign\" on the IOC and NCAA to \"do the right thing for women and girls across the country.\"\n\nAt the signing ceremony, Trump said he would prevent transgender athletes from obtaining visas for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\nIn response to questions about how the order would apply, the IOC issued a statement via email, stating, \"Working with the respective International Sports Federations, the IOC will continue to explain and discuss the various topics with the relevant authorities.\" A spokesperson for the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee did not respond to requests Wednesday for comment.\n\nHow will it be enforced?\n\nEnforcement of Title IX rests with the federal government, administered through the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, which has the ability to investigate alleged violations and withhold federal funding. On Thursday, the Department of Education announced Title IX investigations into two universities and a high school athletic association where transgender athletes reportedly competed.\n\nTwenty-five states already have legislation in place that bars transgender girls and women from girls' and women's sports. Those laws focus on K-12 and competitive, club and intramural collegiate sports at public schools and universities. Enforcement of those laws typically falls to individual schools and districts. Some states have put a process in place that enables a school to challenge a student's eligibility.\n\nMiyares, the Virginia attorney general, said states can also investigate violations based on anti-discrimination laws, and cited an ongoing state-led investigation of Roanoke College, a private university where a transgender woman requested to switch from the men's swim team to the women's team, prompting opposition from current members of the women's team. He said state-imposed consequences for violating the ban could \"run the gamut from financial penalties to a consent decree where they agree to stop the discriminatory practices.\"\n\nWhen referencing sport-specific governing bodies, the executive order calls upon state attorneys general to \"identify best practices in defining and enforcing equal opportunities for women to participate in sports.\"\n\nHow states plan to enforce a ban against transgender athletes outside of a school setting, such as club sports or professional sports, remains to be seen.\n\nIn terms of enforcing restrictions against international athletes, the order directs two federal agencies -- the State Department and Homeland Security -- to manage that through the review of visa applications, \"with an objective of preventing such entry to the extent permitted by law.\"\n\nHow did the controversy start?\n\nControversy surrounding transgender athletes in girls' and women's sports started to bubble in 2017 when Mack Beggs, a transgender boy, won his district girls' wrestling championship via forfeit, qualifying for the Texas state championship. Beggs would go on to win that championship and defended it the following season. That same year, Andraya Yearwood, a transgender girl in Connecticut, won a Class M state championship in girls' track and field.\n\nAnother transgender girl competed in Connecticut the following season. Combined, they won 15 state championships from 2018 to 2020. The Alliance Defending Freedom filed a complaint in the summer of 2019, arguing the state's high school association's inclusive policy violated Title IX. ADF then filed a federal lawsuit on Feb. 12, 2020, the same day Idaho state Rep. Barbara Ehardt introduced HB 500, which became the first law that barred transgender girls and women from girls' and women's sports in K-12 and collegiate sports. ADF consulted on the bill.\n\nEight additional states followed Idaho's lead and passed similar legislation in 2021. In December 2021, Lia Thomas, a transgender woman swimming on the Penn women's team, posted the top times in the country in the 200-yard and 500-yard freestyle. Thomas had previously swum three seasons on the men's team, including one while suppressing her testosterone. Her participation on the women's team -- she won an NCAA championship in 500 free -- brought national attention to the topic of transgender women competing in women's sports.\n\nIn 2023, under the Biden administration, the Department of Education released proposed rules that would have prohibited schools from adopting wholesale bans on transgender athletes from participating on teams that align with their gender identity but gave them some flexibility to restrict participation based on grade, sport and level of competition to ensure fairness and prevent sports-related injuries.\n\nTransgender students in elementary school would generally be able to participate because sports at that level are focused on \"building teamwork, fitness, and basic skills,\" the department said as an example. As students get older and the stakes get higher in high school and college, where issues of fairness in competition become more of a factor, schools may institute certain criteria that limit participation of some transgender students, according to the proposal.\n\nBy 2024, the number of states that had passed legislation barring transgender girls and women from girls' and women's sports grew to 25. Riley Gaines, who became a prominent anti-transgender activist after tying Thomas for fifth place in the 200 free at the 2022 NCAA championships, led a lawsuit against the NCAA that is still pending. The reported presence of a transgender athlete on the roster of the San Jose State University volleyball team sparked forfeits from five teams, including four within the Mountain West Conference. Athletes and an SJSU assistant coach sued the conference.\n\nThe topic became a major issue in the 2024 presidential election, with Republicans reportedly spending hundreds of millions on ads criticizing Kamala Harris and Democrats for supporting transgender rights, including transgender athletes in women's sports. In December, the Department of Education withdrew its proposed rule as the administration prepared to change hands.\n\nA 2023 poll conducted by The Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation found the majority of Americans believe transgender girls and women should not be allowed to compete in girls' and women's sports.","summary":"Trump's executive order raises questions about which athletes and organizations are impacted.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JACQUELINE LINDENBERG and HEIDI PARKER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:19:12 GMT, 6 February 2025 |Updated:19:24 GMT, 6 February 2025 \n\nMegan Fox is 'done for good' with Machine Gun Kelly, it has been claimed, as the former couple prepare to welcome their first child together. \nThe Transformers actress 38 - whose ex Brian Austin Green recently slammed the singer - is 'taking space apart' from the Bad Things rapper, 34, a source told Us Weekly in an article published on Thursday. \nIn December it was revealed that the two stars had split, just weeks after announcing they are expecting baby number one. \nShe is already mom to three children with ex-husband Green, who has also shared the reasoning behind his verbal attack towards MGK. \n'They don't talk at great lengths but have exchanged a few texts,' the insider said of Fox and Kelly, adding Megan has cut down communication with the music artist in order to 'heal.' \nFox has been 'taking space apart from MGK and it's been beneficial,' the source further continued. \n\nMegan Fox, 38, is 'done for good' with Machine Gun Kelly, 34, as the former couple prepare to welcome their first child together\nDespite the pair no longer being together, the actress still 'wants him to be a part of their child's life' but emphasizes she 'doesn't want to be in a relationship with him.'\nHowever, Machine Gun Kelly 'wants to get back together with Megan, but she's told him she is done for good.' \nEarlier this week, Green notably blasted MGK for not being 'honest' and told him to stop trying to 'drag other people' in a post on his Instagram stories. \nAnd on Wednesday while making an appearance at the Hollywood Virgin book launch in West Hollywood, the actor opened up to People about the reasoning behind the action. \nThe Beverly Hills, 90210 star expressed that he hasn't heard from the rapper since posting the message and doesn't expect Kelly to reach out. \nBrian - who was married to Megan between 2010 and 2021 - took to Instagram after Kelly questioned the narrative that surrounds his relationship with the actress.\n'That's not something that I normally do, but it just really at the time, really got under my skin to read about his sort of take on it,' he told the outlet at the event. \n'So I spoke my mind, but then I've since come to terms with the fact that I won't do that anymore. I'm going to shut up and just sit back.'\n\n'They don't talk at great lengths but have exchanged a few texts,' the insider said of Fox and Kelly, adding Megan has cut down communication with the music artist in order to 'heal'; seen in 2022 in West Hollywood \n\n'That's not something that I normally do, but it just really at the time, really got under my skin to read about his sort of take on it,' he told the outlet at the event; Fox and Green seen in 2019 in L.A. \nFox and Green co-parent their three children Noah, 12, Bodhi, 10, and Journey, eight. He also shares son Zane, two, with Sharna Burgess. \nWhile also talking to People on Wednesday, Brian revealed that the entire family is excited for the birth of Megan's fourth child. \n\n Megan Fox's ex Brian Austin Green slams Machine Gun Kelly \n'They're super excited. We're all super excited and it's coming soon and Megan is going to be an amazing mother to this baby as well, and I can't wait to hear about it. And I of course wish her the absolute best.' \nHe continued, 'The kids are incredibly excited, Sharna's excited. We're excited for Zane to spend time with the baby. We're excited to all come together and bond over it. It's an amazing time.'\nOn his Instagram stories, Green had penned: 'Bro. Just be honest for once in your life. Stop caring so much about how you're perceived that you will try and drag other people.' \nThe actor additionally attached Kelly's track, Don't Let Me Go, to his social media post. \nIn December, Brian expressed regret that Megan is navigating her latest pregnancy while dealing with the fallout from her break-up.\nThe actor told TMZ: 'I hope that the best outcome that could possibly happen happens for her and for the baby and for our kids.'\nMeanwhile, an insider recently claimed that Megan 'just wants to focus' on her pregnancy. She is determined to focus on her unborn baby, rather than drama in her love life.\n\nWhile also talking to People on Wednesday, Brian revealed that the entire family is excited for the birth of Megan's fourth child\nThe insider told People: 'They tried to make things work for many years. It was exhausting for Megan. She's done with him now. She just wants to focus on the baby and her boys now.'\nMegan 'doesn't have much contact' with the Wild Boy hitmaker, even though they're expecting a child together.\nHowever, Megan is feeling upbeat ahead of welcoming her fourth child.\nThe insider said: 'She lives alone and doesn't have much contact with Machine Gun Kelly. She's doing okay. She's very excited about the baby.'\nMGK and Fox split in November shortly after announcing they were expecting their first baby together and amid claims he was speaking to other women 'behind her back.'\nThe Transformers star is due in March and sources told TMZ the pair are 'not on good terms' and that it is 'unclear how involved he will be when the baby comes.'\nThey claim the star is done with MGK and that her inner circle are happy about it and feel 'she finally came to her senses by shutting him out of her life.' \nAlso back in December, an insider revealed that the actress, allegedly 'found text messages involving other women and decided she was done.'\n\nMegan 'doesn't have much contact' with the Wild Boy hitmaker, even though they're expecting a child together; seen in 2023 in L.A. \n\nThe Transformers star is due in March and sources told TMZ the pair are 'not on good terms' and that it is 'unclear how involved he will be when the baby comes'\n\nWhen they went away for the Thanksgiving holiday, she became suspicious and decided to go through his phone,' a source told Page Six following news of their breakup. \nBefore making her discovery, the Jennifer's Body star already 'had trust issues' with My Ex's Best Friend hitmaker (born Colson Baker) 'because of past behavior.'\nThe insider noted that despite their ups and downs over the years, she 'was willing to look past all that' and 'rebuild her trust with Colson and was excited to grow their family together.'\nShe called called it quits after their near five year romance over Thanksgiving weekend while together in Vail, Colorado, per TMZ. \nThe pair are said to have split less than two weeks after the pregnancy reveal after Fox 'found material on MGK's phone that was upsetting, and it made her want him to leave the trip early.'\nThe musician then left the trip early and the exes have not seen each other since.\nMGK, whose legal name is Colson Baker, is dad to 15-year-old Casie, whom he shares with his ex Emma Cannon. \nMegan and Kelly have had a passionate and rocky relationship. They first met on the set of Midnight in The Switchgrass before getting engaged in 2022. \nWhen announcing their betrothal on Instagram, Megan said she and MGK 'drank each other's blood' to celebrate the occasion.\nBut just over a year later, Megan sensationally hinted she had split from MGK as she shared a cryptic Instagram post before completely deleting her account.\n\nBefore making her discovery, the Jennifer's Body star already 'had trust issues' with My Ex's Best Friend hitmaker (born Colson Baker) 'because of past behavior'; seen in 2023 in L.A. \n\nThe actress posted a video in which she appeared to burn a letter in a bonfire, along with a bag.\nShe also uploaded a very raunchy string of mirror selfies while joined by a male pal, in which she put on a busty display in a plunging black top and cut-out trousers.\nMegan wrote in her caption, 'You can taste the dishonesty/ it's all over your breath,' which are lyrics from Beyoncé's 2016 track, Pray You Catch Me, about her husband Jay Z's own affair.\nShe then removed all traces of Machine Gun Kelly from her Instagram grid, having unfollowed him before deleting her account altogether.\nUltimately they seemed to patch things up and things appear to be all well between them now, with the couple being seen together ever since.\nInstagramMegan FoxMachine Gun Kelly\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nMegan Fox is 'done for good' with Machine Gun Kelly as she expects the singer's baby\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nCelebrity chef Gino D'Acampo hit with multiple allegations of 'sexually inappropriate and intimidating behaviour' over 12-year period\n\nLauryn Goodman 'will move to Italy NEXT WEEK' as she follows footballer Kyle Walker abroad amid his marital woes with Annie Kilner\n\nBianca Censori reveals how she really felt about controversial naked red carpet stunt as Kanye West boasts that he and wife'beat the Grammys'\n\nMOLLY CLAYTON: Lottie Moss has branded me 'jealous' after I revealed our encounter from hell.

As though humans felt a need to huddle, to be gentler with one another, to counterbalance the violence and nastiness spewing from the White House.\n\nOh sure, sitting in Canada it’s tempting to snort and say: Pfft, tough. You should have voted for Kamala Harris. This is where I remind you that more people voted against Donald Trump than for him. He got just under half the 155.2 million ballots cast. He won the election, sure, but his mandate is nowhere near as strong as he claims. Today, not yet a month after Inauguration Day, voter’s remorse is hitting hard.\n\nI have no clue where Trump’s sudden animosity towards Canada and our exports came from, but in all my years of roaming the United States I have never — not once — met anyone who shared those views. Typically, the reaction is in line with that of the person at the garage in Huntsville who helped me fix a busted headlight: “Oh, we love Canadians! Y’all are so nice!”\n\nEven among people who voted for Trump, there are plenty who don’t fully support his plan to turn America into a broligarchy. Or turn Gaza into a Hobby Lobby or whatever. I had the pleasure last week of meeting Alabama State Representative Marilyn Lands, a rare Democrat politician in a sea of Republicans. She won a special election last March, running on a resolutely pro-reproductive choice platform. She didn’t just win that election; she crushed the Republican with more than 62 per cent of ballots cast. If that doesn’t give you hope, I don’t know what will.\n\nI don’t have any time, nor indeed anything polite to say, about the scoundrel desecrating the White House. And I have no business telling anyone how and where to spend their money. I just want to ask y’all to remember that we are richer when we react to hatred with love rather than more hatred.

And there was the pair of Christian podcasters who, at a rally the night before Trump’s inauguration, thanked God for “choosing President Donald Trump as a vessel for your nation,” as my colleague David Corn covered.\n\nThe signs, in other words, have been there for a while. \n\nBut at the National Prayer Breakfast—a decades-old, purportedly interfaith annual event—in DC on Thursday, President Trump laid out the steps he will take, now that he’s in office, to make those dreams of Christian nationalist power a reality. “We want to bring religion back—stronger, bigger, better than ever before,” he said. These measures will allegedly include:\n\nCreating a so-called Presidential Commission on Religious Liberty, which he so eloquently claimed will “be a very big deal”;\n\nSigning an executive order ordering newly-confirmed Attorney General Pam Bondi to “eradicate anti-Christian bias” inside the federal government and “prosecute anti-Christian violence and vandalism in our society”;\n\nAnd creating a new Faith Office in the White House, which will be led by the televangelist and Trump acolyte Rev. Paula White—who, as my colleagues Stephanie Mencimer and Kiera Butler have written, is often associated with an evangelical Christian movement known as the New Apostolic Reformation, whose leaders claim that God speaks directly to them and “that Christians are called to wage a spiritual battle for control of the United States.”\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to several questions from Mother Jones seeking more details on the proposals Trump outlined—including whether Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency agrees that these efforts would be a good use of taxpayer dollars and what evidence, if any, Trump has that there is a problem of “anti-Christian bias” within the federal government. \n\nTrump at the National Prayer Breakfast announces that he's signing an order directing AG Pam Bondi to head a task force \"to eradicate anti-Christian bias\" pic.twitter.com/pa8yoGrsnT— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 6, 2025\n\nThe sole example Trump cited at the breakfast was the case of Paulette Harlow, one of the nearly two dozen people he pardoned two weeks ago for blocking the entrances to abortion clinics (some of the more serious violations included breaking into the clinics and stealing fetal tissue). Harlow, a 70-something Massachusetts resident, was sentenced to two years in prison last May for being part of a group that broke into a DC abortion clinic in October 2020 and livestreamed their blockading of the entrance; she was found guilty following a bench trial of federal civil rights conspiracy and violating the FACE Act, a federal law that prevents interfering with access to reproductive health clinics, including anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers, according to Biden’s Department of Justice. (Trump’s DOJ has said they will limit enforcement of the law, which has abortion clinics bracing for potentially violent protests.)\n\nBut in Trump’s rewriting of history on Thursday, he falsely claimed that Harlow “was put in jail because she was praying”—which even Harlow’s attorney has previously said is not accurate. In fact, according to court documents, Harlow was not a peaceful protester, but instead body-slammed the clinic manager into a waiting room chair. Once law enforcement arrived, she told them she would not cooperate with arrest and that they would have to “use a power-saw to cut the bike lock she affixed to her neck” to attach herself to other protesters as part of the blockade, the court documents state. (Harlow denied the allegations against her at trial, despite video evidence proving otherwise.)\n\nTrump also falsely claimed that the FACE Act was “selectively weaponized against Christians by the previous administration”—but Biden’s DOJ also enforced the law against abortion rights protesters who targeted anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers. The White House did not immediately respond to my questions Thursday afternoon about whether Trump would issue corrections for those false statements.\n\n“She got lucky that I won that election,” Trump said of Harlow, who was at the event Thursday. He then addressed her directly: “I want to thank you very much for being here, Paulette. Enjoy your life.” The crowd laughed.\n\nThe president also went through his greatest hits of baseless and boastful remarks, some of which—one couldn’t help but notice, given the setting—are decidedly blasphemous.\n\n“I like people that make money,” he said at one point. (God doesn’t.) \n\n“We won by a massive majority,” he said at another. (He won 49.8 percent of the popular vote, to Kamala Harris’ 48.3 percent.)\n\n“As I said at my inaugural address two weeks ago, a light is now shining over the world—the entire world—and I’m hearing it from other leaders,” he said of his second term. (The Bible warns against such pridefulness.) \n\n“The opposite side—they oppose religion, they oppose God,” Trump claimed. (Former President Biden is a practicing Catholic who has been open about his faith, and former Vice President Kamala Harris is a practicing Baptist who said one of her first phone calls after Biden dropped out of the race and asked her to step in last summer was to her pastor.) \n\nTrump also, as he has done several times now, teased potentially running for a third term—which would be in violation of the Constitution. That may be a joke—but the arrival of Christian nationalism at the White House is not.\n\nUpdate, Feb. 6: This post was updated with more details from court documents of Harlow’s actions.","summary":"We always knew that Trump&#8217;s return to the White House would bring Christian nationalism to the highest levels of government.

UFC heavyweight champ Jon Jones said that he would be launching a new initiative partnering with the nonprofit group Power to the Patients to take on hospitals, pharmacy benefit managers and insurance companies, which he says have \"refuse[d]\" to be transparent with their prices in order to rake in more profits. \"This next fight for me is a personal one, but it's not just for me. It's for every American who has ever been bullied, robbed or deceived. It's arguably the most important fight of my career,\" Jones said in a mock press conference akin to those he participates in when announcing his next UFC opponent. \"My next opponent will be: the American healthcare system.\" VA SECRETARY DOUG COLLINS PRIORITIZES EFFICIENCY, HEALTHCARE FLEXIBILITY FOR VETERANS During his first term, President Donald Trump passed healthcare price transparency rules that forced hospitals and insurers to publish all their prices, so patients could make more informed decisions about where they want to get their treatment and, as a result, increase competition and lower prices. On the 2024 campaign trail, President Trump suggested during an interview with podcaster Theo Von that the lack of transparency around healthcare pricing amounted to \"extortion\" by these wealthy companies, and he charged former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris with refusing to enforce his first-term rule. However, according to Trump, he'll be \"pressing\" to ensure that this sort of transparency in the healthcare system comes to fruition. Jones said during the mock press conference that people should know whether an MRI costs $600 or $6,000, noting that \"in America, we shouldn't have to advocate for honesty and accountability in healthcare.\" LGBTQ+ ADVOCATES, FAMILIES SUE TRUMP ADMIN FOR ENDING FUNDING OF TRANSGENDER HEALTHCARE UNDER 19 Medical bills are a leading cause of bankruptcy in the U.S., according to some studies. The National Institutes of Health posited in 2019 that a survey of debtors showed that the majority of respondents, 58.5%, agreed that medical expenses contributed to their financial woes. Trump has said that if his first-term rules on healthcare pricing transparency had been enforced the way he envisioned, it could have brought down the price of care by as much as 50% to 60%. Trump also blamed the healthcare industry's \"powerful\" lobby for a reason why the rules have not been adequately enforced. TRUMP HANDED ‘OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE MEDICARE’ AFTER BIDEN ADMIN'S FINAL BLOW TO SENIORS: EXPERT While Jones and Trump are allies – the fighter presented the president with his champion belt during one of his recent fights and also surprised fans with Trump's signature dance move following his win – the issue is a bipartisan one. During the last Congress, a cohort of Republicans and Democrats sought to pass legislation clamping down on improving hospital and insurer price transparency. Power to the Patients is no stranger to star power. The group has partnered in the past with country superstars Lainey Wilson and Jelly Roll, as well as rappers Fat Joe, Method Man and others. \"I am proud to be joining Power to the Patients to take on hospitals and insurance companies that refuse to show their prices,\" Jones told Fox News Digital. \"For years, hospitals and insurers have been disregarding rules requiring them to disclose prices to patients in advance of care. In a healthcare system that lacks transparency and accountability, Jones said, \"Without real prices, hospitals and health insurers are making healthcare in America unaffordable, inaccessible, and totally dishonest. When we can’t see or compare real prices upfront, we are blindsided by overcharges, price-gouging and surprise bills that we can’t verify are correct.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"In his first term, President Trump took aggressive and historic action to make healthcare prices available to patients before they get care instead of sticking Americans with surprise bills,\" said White House spokesperson Kush Desai. \"After the Biden administration neglected implementation of these commonsense ideas and allowed the healthcare industry to keep patients in the dark, the second Trump administration is committed to lowering costs and Making America Healthy Again by giving Americans the choices they want and the transparency they need to make informed decisions.\"","summary":"Jones announced Thursday that he would be partnering with Power to the Patients to take on hospitals, pharmacy benefit managers, and insurance companies, which he says have &quot;refuse[d]&quot; to be transparent with their prices in order to rake in more profit.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jon-jones-healthcare-reform-new-price-transparency-partnership","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/02/931/523/gettyimages-2185189787-scaled.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 19:00:59","author":"Alec Schemmel","authors":["Alec Schemmel"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.059},{"id":287820312,"title":"Donald Trump's secret vendetta against the NFL made him run for president, reveals Stephen A.

Smith reveals why he would beat all political rivals \n\nPODCAST: Get all the latest news and insider gossip on our new politics show – Welcome to MAGAland\n\nBy DANIEL MATTHEWS IN NEW ORLEANS\n\nPublished: 18:35 GMT, 6 February 2025 | Updated: 18:48 GMT, 6 February 2025\n\nStephen A. Smith has lifted the lid on the conversation in 2014 when Donald Trump vowed to run for president due to a vengeful vendetta against the NFL.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with DailyMail.com in New Orleans, Smith teased his own run for the White House - a decade after Trump reached out before making a failed bid to buy the Buffalo Bills.\n\nThe president confirmed ahead of last year's election that he offered $1billion cash for the NFL team in 2014, following the death of founder and Hall of Fame owner Ralph Wilson.\n\nTrump was one of three known finalists in the battle to take charge of Buffalo. A group led by rock star Jon Bon Jovi also showed interest in acquiring the team.\n\nIn the end, however, the owners of hockey's Buffalo Sabres, Terry and Kim Pegula, won the bidding with $1.4bn offer.\n\nSmith can still recall what Trump told him before his offer was turned down.\n\nStephen A. Smith revealed he spoke to Donald Trump ahead of his bid to buy the Buffalo Bills\n\nBack in October, Trump opened up on his attempt to buy the NFL team back in 2014\n\nTerry and Kim Pegula, parents of tennis star Jess Pegula, won the bidding with $1.4billion offer\n\n'I am the person that Donald Trump called in 2014 when he wanted to purchase the Buffalo Bills,' the ESPN star said.\n\n'His exact words to me were - excuse my language: \"If them motherf***ers get in my way, meaning the NFL owners, I'm gonna get them all back\",' Smith said. \n\n'\"I'm going to run for president.\" Those were his exact words. They didn't let the sale go through, and he ran for president.'\n\nTrump is set to become the first ever sitting president to attend the Super Bowl when he heads to New Orleans on Sunday to watch the Chiefs face the Eagles.\n\nBack in October, ahead of his election win over Kamala Harris, the 78-year-old opened up on his attempt at becoming an NFL owner, insisting he was 'not close' to taking over the Bills.\n\n'I bid $1bn dollars and I put up a letter of credit. I thought I might get it because it was in Buffalo which was having some troubles... and (Pegula) bid $1.4bn - so it's $400m more,' Trump said during an appearance on the popular YouTube show 'Bussin' With The Boys'\n\n'I don't think it was a very serious run but I gave them a guarantee of a $1bn so that's always serious, right?'\n\nHe added: 'The owner who got it is a very good man. I think he's done a great job. Well, he made a great pick - he picked a great quarterback in Josh (Allen).'\n\n'He made a great pick - he picked a great quarterback in Josh (Allen),' Trump said of Pegula\n\nSmith has more support than several big-name Democratic presidential hopefuls, a poll said\n\nThe ESPN host was speaking ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl between the Eagles and Chiefs\n\nSmith also spoke to DailyMail.com about his own political ambitions and the controversy surrounding a 'black national anthem' being sung ahead of the Super Bowl.\n\nA recent poll, looking ahead to the 2028 presidential race, revealed that that the ESPN star has more political support than several big-name Democrat hopefuls.\n\nRemarkably, Smith polled only one percentage point behind Tim Walz - Harris' vice-presidential pick - and Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro. \n\nSTEPHEN A. SMITH: I'm considering running for PRESIDENT - here's why I'll sweep the floor\n\nThe 57-year-old claimed he had no desire to become entangled in the messy web of politics but he insisted: 'Assuming that I'm well off, that I have lots of money, and money is no longer a concern, if the American people came to me and looked at me and said \"Yo, man, we want you to run for office\", and I had a legitimate shot to win the presidency of the United States, I'm not gonna lie. I'll think about that.\n\n'But I gotta have my money. I'm not gonna go to the White House broke. I'm not gonna do that. I gotta have my money. I gotta have my home. I gotta have my financial situation completely taken care of. I have no concerns if that happens for me.\n\n'If they told me I had a legitimate, bonafide shot to win the presidency of the United States of America, I would entertain it.\n\n'Because the part that I'm not joking about is I believe I could beat every candidate on that poll. Every candidate that they mentioned, from Kamala Harris right on down to (Pete) Buttigieg and to Tim Walz. I'd beat all of them. I do believe that. I really do.'\n\nPoliticsKamala HarrisSteve SmithDonald Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDonald Trump's secret vendetta against the NFL made him run for president, reveals Stephen A.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy AMY LAMARE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:18:02 GMT, 6 February 2025 |Updated:18:44 GMT, 6 February 2025 \n\nJennifer Aniston and Selena Gomez co-hosted a Galentine's Day event this week at san Vicente Bungalows in West Hollywood.\nThe event was for Aniston's LolaVie and Gomez's Rare Beauty and brought together a group of women to try products during the party.\nThe Friends star, 55, and Only Murders in the Building actress, 32, stood in front of the group of women and talked about their beauty brands.\n'We just want to celebrate women and friendship, and how we just want to continue to uplift each other,' Selena began.\n'And I've known Jennifer for over a decade now and she's someone I've always looked up to, and she's always been there for me. \n'And it's nice to have people in life who can just be there and hear you out,' the Emilia Perez star said in her speech.'\nThis is the first time Selena has been seen since there was backlash over her crying deportation video. \n\nJennifer Aniston and Selena Gomez co-hosted a Galentine's Day event and looked like BFFs during it\n\n'It's been a really hard couple of weeks,' an emotional Jennifer said, adding that she hopes everyone is 'safe and okay' after the recent LA fires.\n'But we're here to celebrate women and support each other.'\n\nEXCLUSIVE Inside Selena Gomez's decision to delete crying video about migrants \nThe Galentine's Day event also featured a movie screening of the iconic 1995 teen comedy film Clueless starring Alicia Silverstone.\nGomez and Aniston's friendship began when they met through their shared management team.\nBut Selena shared an adorable story about running into the Morning Show star in 2009 when she was 16.\n'I was shaking! I ran into Jennifer in the bathroom and she goes, \"Hi!\" My legs started to shake and I ran. I didn't know what to do because I freaked out,' she told Just Jared.\n'I always say that I worship Rachel McAdams as a movie actress but for comedy—the whole reason I started my show and mannerisms, they were after Jennifer Aniston. \n'It was so funny, they were playing clip reels of the work she's done and I quoted the whole thing. Every single thing she'd say, I would say it. People were sitting there laughing at me and they're like, \"Wow, you're obsessed.\"'\n\nThe event was for Aniston's LolaVie and Gomez's Rare Beauty and brought together a group of women to try products during the party\n\nThe Friends star, 55, and Only Murders in the Building actress, 32, stood in front of the group of women and talked about their beauty brands\n\n'We just want to celebrate women and friendship, and how we just want to continue to uplift each other,' Selena began\n\n'I have not only been following her career as a fan since I was 8 and now get to watch her completely transform in her new movie Cake, I have gotten to have real conversations with such a real heart, made my entire year. #cake #goseeit,' Gomez captioned a 2014 photo on Instagram.\n'We have the same manager,' Aniston clarified in January 2015 at the premiere of her movie Cake.\n'She's just like a little cherub that I feel like I wanna take care of. And we've just met through our manager. She's been extremely supportive and wonderful.'\nSelena talked about meeting Jen in an interview with KTU radio, 'so it was kind of like a friendly meeting and instantly she's, like, inviting me to her house. \n'She has a pizza oven. Like, we've made pizzas at her house, the Wizards of Waverly Place star gushed.\n'She's very cool and very sweet,' Gomez continued. 'She kind of gives me a lot of, like, maternal advice.'\nThe Galentine's event comes after Selena posted and later deleted a tearful video about Donald Trump's deportation policy.\nSelena admitted she felt powerless over the situation, telling her 422 million followers: 'I'm so sorry, I wish I could do something, but I can't. I don't know what to do. I'll try everything.' \n\n'And I've known Jennifer for over a decade now and she's someone I've always looked up to, and she's always been there for me'\n\n'And it's nice to have people in life who can just be there and hear you out,' the Emilia Perez star said in her speech\n\nThe singer and actress, 32, sobbed as the spoke about Trump's immigration policy in an emotional clip shared to her Instagram Stories.\nPredictably, the video sparked a fierce backlash from Republicans and MAGA supporters, including US Senate candidate Sam Parker who called for the Bad Liar singer (who was born in the U.S. to an American mother) to be deported in the wake of her meltdown.\nAn insider told DailyMail.com why Gomez, who is engaged to Benny Blanco, swiftly deleted the post and is vowing to 'stay out of politics'.\n'She realizes that she cannot go up against a Republican backed nation - many of whom are loyal customers of her Rare Beauty brand,' they said. 'She does not wish to alienate.\n'She is going to stay out of politics and in her own lane after that drama.'\nJennifer AnistonSelena Gomez\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSelena Gomez seen for first time since deportation video backlash as she holds hands with pal Jennifer Aniston\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nCelebrity chef Gino D'Acampo hit with multiple allegations of 'sexually inappropriate and intimidating behaviour' over 12-year period\n\nLauryn Goodman 'will move to Italy NEXT WEEK' as she follows footballer Kyle Walker abroad amid his marital woes with Annie Kilner\n\nBianca Censori reveals how she really felt about controversial naked red carpet stunt as Kanye West boasts that he and wife'beat the Grammys'\n\nMOLLY CLAYTON: Lottie Moss has branded me 'jealous' after I revealed our encounter from hell.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy AMELIA WYNNE FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:18:02 GMT, 6 February 2025 |Updated:18:12 GMT, 6 February 2025 \n\nSharon Osbourne has admitted she's feeling 'emotional' about husband Ozzy's final gig but has said it's time for the rock legend to 'say goodnight' to his fans as he battles Parkinson's. \nThe musician, whose health has delayed he and wife Sharon's move back to the UK, has undergone seven surgeries in the past five years, including a fourth spinal surgery in September 2023, and has been battling Parkinson's disease since 2003. \nAnd it was revealed on Wednesday that his band is preparing to reunite for the first time in 20 years alongside a host of other big names.\nThe original line-up of heavy metal legends Black Sabbath will play together at a one-off concert in Birmingham, UK, this summer.\nThe show will take place on July 5 at the birthplace of the band and will feature Ozzy, 76, Tommy, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward.\nHowever, it came as an unexpected move as in a March 2024 interview with Rolling Stone, Ozzy admitted he wasn't optimistic about being on stage again.\n\nSharon Osbourne has admitted she's feeling 'emotional' about husband Ozzy's final gig but has said it's time for the rock legend to 'say goodnight' to his fans as he battles Parkinson's \n\nThe musician has undergone seven surgeries in the past five years, including a fourth spinal surgery in September 2023, and has been battling Parkinson's disease since 2003\nOn Thursday Sharon spoke on feeling 'emotional' about the show in an interview with Radio X Classic Rock.\nOn how she feels about the upcoming gig she said: 'Very emotional but very happy. \n'It's time for Ozzy to say goodnight to everybody and what better way to do it than to do it surrounded by your friends, your family and back to the beginning, the place where he was born in Aston?'\nSpeaking of the star-studded line-up for the show which includes Metallica to Slayer, she added: 'It's heartwarming and to realise what great friends you've got. \n'And Ozzy is loved and by his peers and Sabbath. You know, Ozzy and Sabbath are loved and it's fantastic. \n'It's really a great feeling to think that all the years you've been in the industry and you're still loved and relevant and, you know, people want to celebrate your body of work that you've done. And the fans, you know, it's all about the fans too.'\nAsked how he will be preparing for the show amid his health battles, she answered: 'You know, Parkinson's isn't something that goes away. You have it forever. There's no cure. \n'So he has battles with it where, you know, he has to work with the physical therapist every day. And, you know, he's got to keep his muscles going, and he's, you know, he's. He's fine. As fine as you can be with Parkinson's, you know?'\nOzzy admitted he 'can't stand up right' in a heartbreaking interview from less than a year ago - and fans are voicing concerns over the rocker's health after he announced Black Sabbath's final ever gig.\n\nAnd it was revealed on Wednesday that his band is preparing to reunite for the first time in 20 years alongside a host of other big names\n\nOn how she feels about the upcoming gig Sharon said on Thursday: 'Very emotional but very happy'\n\nSpeaking of the star-studded line-up for the show which includes Metallica to Slayer, she added: 'It's heartwarming and to realise what great friends you've got'\n\nIn a March 2024 interview with Rolling Stone, Ozzy admitted he wasn't optimistic about being on stage again.\nWhen quizzed on the possibility, he responded: 'I would love to, but I can't stand up right. Maybe I'll do something one day. I miss it terribly.'\nThe star was then asked if he would consider doing ' a short set if inducted into the Rock Hall,' to which he responded: 'Maybe. We'll see.' \nThe British musician was diagnosed with a mild form of Parkinson's disease in 2003, however he only went public with the condition in 2020.\nHowever, Ozzy has said that his biggest struggles are due to a fall which he suffered in 2019 which caused metal rods in his back to dislodge.\nThe rods had been put there following a quad bike accident at his Buckinghamshire home in 2003.\n\n Ozzy Osbourne, 76, announces final Black Sabbath gig as band reunite for first time in 20 years \nHe told Rolling Stone UK magazine: 'The second surgery went drastically wrong and virtually left me crippled.\n'I thought I'd be up and running after the second and third, but with the last one they put a f*ing rod in my spine.\n'They found a tumour in one of the vertebrae, so they had to dig all that out too. It's pretty rough, man, and my balance is all f*ed up.'\nThe Prince of Darkness also said how he has 'ten tears left' to live as he recalled a disagreed with his wife over smoking cannabis.\n'[Sharon] said, 'What are you doing that for! It'll f****** kill you!' I said, 'How long do you want me to f****** live for?!''.\nGoing on to say: 'At best, I've got ten years left and when you're older, time picks up speed. Me and Sharon had our 41st wedding anniversary recently, and that's just unbelievable to me!'.\nSharon, who shares three children with the star, described her husband's numerous surgeries as 'five years of heartache'.\n'I've just felt so helpless and so bad for Ozzy, to see him going through the pain. He's gone through all these operations and the whole thing has felt like a nightmare'.\nShe continued: 'He hasn't lost his sense of humour, but I look at my husband, and he's here while everyone else is out on the road. This is the longest time he hasn't ever worked for. Being at home for so long has been so foreign to him'.\nOzzy also explained his previous devastation of being unable to do one last gig for his fans, after being forced to cancel his tour in 2023.\n'That's one of the things I've been the most fucking pissed off at: I never got the chance to say goodbye or thank you'.\nBefore adding: 'That's my goal to work to. To do those shows. I just want to be well enough to do one show where I can say :'Hi guys, thanks so much for my life'.\n'That's what I'm working towards, and if I drop down dead at the end of it, I'll die a happy man.'\n\nBlack Sabbath pictured in the 70s - L-R: (back) Geezer Butler, Tony Iommi, (front) Bill Ward, Ozzy Osbourne - posed, group shot \n\nSharon, who shares three children with the star, has described her husband's numerous surgeries as 'five years of heartache' (pictured 2017)\nIn October 2024, the Black Sabbath star joked: 'I'm nearly f***ing dead!' as he opened up about his health issues and the complication that causes him the most issues. \nIn an interview with The Sun, Ozzy revealed he hasn't walked properly since he underwent a surgery after his fall in 2019.\nThe star went into more details as he revealed he tripped during a bathroom visit in the night and fell over and landed wrong. \nHe explained: 'I went to the doctor's and you assume everybody knows what they're doing. My son Jack has a video of me going into surgery, saying, 'I'll see you in a few minutes'. I haven't walked properly since.'\nOzzy confessed he believes too much blame for his predicament has been placed on his Parkinson's diagnosis.\nHe argued: 'I mean, when I came off the quad bike in 2003, I still did tours and I had Parkinson's back then. It was THAT f*****g surgery.'\nSharon and Ozzy's move back to the UK was delayed for months due to his various health struggles.\nOn a July 2023 episode of The Osbournes, which co-stars the couple's kids Kelly and Jack Osbourne, Sharon said, 'It just seems that every time we're set to go [back to England], something happens with Ozzy's health.' \n\nThe British musician was diagnosed with a mild form of Parkinson's disease in 2003, however he only went public with the condition in 2020 (pictured 2014)\n'We'll get there,' Sharon said, adding, 'We wanna go back so bad, but we'll get there. Won't we, Ozzy?' \nThe pair first announced their plans to relocate overseas, where they're from, in August 2022 - and they finally became a reality in November 2023.\nWhile many fans of the band are ecstatic and anxiously waiting to be able to try and get their hands on tickets, some have highlighted concerns over whether Ozzy will be well enough to perform.\nTaking to X, formerly Twitter, concerned fans said: 'Wonder if this will really happened! Ozzy's health hasn't been that great! I hope so, though! Sure sounds cool!';\n'The big question is will Ozzy make it to that stage? Hopefully they will make arrangements that make it easier and safe for him to perform with his health issues,';\n'I hate to be that guy, but there's no chance this actually happens right? Ozzy hasn't performed in years due to his health and canceled multiple appearances/shows. Line-up is insane though lol,';\n'Not that long ago, Ozzy barely could give an acceptance speech on the Rock And Roll HOF, while being seated. Really hoping that his health and condition improved since then. But that being said, hardly feasible that Ozzy will be in singing condition,';\n'Considering Ozzy and Geezer's health I fear this will end up being incredibly sad to go watch, I can't see how Ozzy will be able to do a set at all,';\n'Wondering how long Sabbath will play for with that amount of bands and with Ozzy's health.'\nMeanwhile MailOnline readers echoed their sentiments as they said: 'How can he do it? He has Parkinson's both his movements and voice will be seriously impeded. Good luck to them but I think there will be a lot of backing support from sound engineers and singers,'; \n'Went to see them in Birmingham when the original line up got back together. What a fantastic night. Not sure if Oz can perform as he did back then, but if Jagger can still do it, why not.?';\n'It wasn't that long ago Sharon said her and Ozzy wanted to live back in the UK because of the Gun violence in America but said he wasn't well enough to travel,sounds like a miracle has happened so let's see if they come back now he seems healthier.'\nOzzy's wife Sharon was at the announcement of the new show at Birmingham's Villa Park, the concert venue, on Wednesday alongside the band's guitarist Tony Iommi.\nSharon proudly held up a Villa football shirt with Ozzy's name on the back as she posed pitchside.\nThe group pioneered heavy metal music in the early 1970s with hits such as War Pigs, Paranoid and Iron Man.\nSince their last gig together in 2005, Black Sabbath has played in partial reunions but never in their original line-up.\nOzzy's wife Sharon Osbourne has also admitted the show will be a testing experience for the star.\nShe told The Sun: 'He's very happy to be coming back and very emotional about this. Parkinson's is a progressive disease.\n'It's not something you can stabilise. It affects different parts of the body and it's affected his legs. But his voice is as good as it's ever been.'\nProfits from the show will be shared equally between the charities Cure Parkinson's, Birmingham Children's Hospital and Acorn Children's Hospice, with the Parkinson's charity being selected by Sharon and Ozzy.\n\nWhat is Parkinson's ? \n\nParkinson's is a neurodegenerative condition. The illness effects the nerve cells in the brain that control movement.\nOver time the symptoms gradually get worse. It can cause symptoms related to movement as well as pain, depression and loss of smell. \nMost people who get Parkinson's are over 60, but one in ten are under 50 and it affects more men than women. \nWhat causes the symptoms?\nNerve cells in the brain send messages to the rest of out body to control our movements. This is done using chemicals called neurotransmitters.\nAn area of the brain called the substantia nigra produces one of the neurotransmitters that controls movement: dopamine. But in 70 to 80 per cent of people with Parkinson's these dopamine producing cells deteriorate and die. \nThe loss of dopamine-producing neurons results in low levels of dopamine in the part of the brain that controls movement and balance.\nSource: Parkinson's Europe \nSharon OsbourneBirmingham\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSharon Osbourne admits she's feeling 'emotional' about husband Ozzy's final gig but says it's time for the Black Sabbath star to 'say goodnight' to fans as he battles Parkinson's\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nCelebrity chef Gino D'Acampo hit with multiple allegations of 'sexually inappropriate and intimidating behaviour' over 12-year period\n\nLauryn Goodman 'will move to Italy NEXT WEEK' as she follows footballer Kyle Walker abroad amid his marital woes with Annie Kilner\n\nBianca Censori reveals how she really felt about controversial naked red carpet stunt as Kanye West boasts that he and wife'beat the Grammys'\n\nMOLLY CLAYTON: Lottie Moss has branded me 'jealous' after I revealed our encounter from hell.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JACQUELINE LINDENBERG FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:17:06 GMT, 6 February 2025 |Updated:17:47 GMT, 6 February 2025 \n\nBritney Spears has reignited her romance with former criminal Paul Soliz just seven moths after the pop star split from the ex-felon 'over fears he was using her for clout.' \nThe Baby One More Time singer, 43 - who recently showed off her curves in a bizarre dance clip - was spotted with Soliz, 37, earlier this week on Tuesday as she joined him and two of his kids at Lily Pad Playground in the San Fernando Valley, per TMZ. \nLate last year in October, Paul's wife of eight years Nicole Mancilla filed for divorce after he was previously called a 'deadbeat dad' of his nine children. \nSpears notably separated from ex-husband Sam Asghari in 2023 and the pair reached a settlement in their divorce in May 2024. Later that same year in December, the former couple were declared legally single. \nIn a photo obtained by TMZ, Britney could be seen sitting in the passenger seat of a black Mercedes G-Wagon outside of the indoor playground. \nAccording to insiders, the luxurious SUV is the same vehicle that the songstress bought for Paul after dating for only one month. \n\nBritney Spears, 43, has reignited her romance with former criminal Paul Soliz just seven moths after the pop star split from the ex-felon 'over fears he was using her for clout'\n\nThe Baby One More Time singer was spotted with Soliz earlier this week on Tuesday as she joined him and two of his kids at Lily Pad Playground in the San Fernando Valley, per TMZ; Soliz seen in 2023 in L.A. \nWhile Britney mainly kept to herself during the excursion, sources said that Spears had told others, 'These aren't my kids.' \nFollowing the outing at the indoor playground, the Toxic hitmaker reportedly paid the bill before the group headed to their next destination. \nSpears has been spotted with some of Paul's children in the past and in August 2024, she enjoyed time at Sky Zone in Thousand Oaks. \nAt the time, the performer was seen jumping at the trampoline park with three of his kids for around 30 minutes before leaving. \nBack in July of last year, a source informed TMZ that Spears and Soliz had broken up and stated, 'Britney and Paul split around three weeks ago.' \n'And they were done once the singer realized her former maintenance worker-turned-boyfriend was only using her for the luxurious lifestyle.' \nThe star had made the decision to split with the ex-felon after seeing his 'true colors' and also removed his name from the entry list to her lavish mansion. \nAnother reason behind the breakup was due to Britney's own children: sons Preston, 19, and Jayden, 18 - whom she shares with ex-husband Kevin Federline. \n\nSpears notably separated from ex-husband Sam Asghari in 2023 and the pair reached a settlement in their divorce in May 2024; seen in 2018 in Beverly Hills \nA separate insider told DailyMail.com, 'She chose her children and her well-being over Paul. They did not get along and, in fact, he did not treat her how she deserves to be treated.'\n'He was nothing but a rebound and she recognizes this. But she has contact with her children again and this is what is most important to her.'\n\n Britney Spears enjoys trampoline fun with on-off felon boyfriend Paul Soliz's kids \nThe source added, 'This has made her feel whole again and she realized that in their absence she was seeking something or someone to fill the void but no one can.'\n'She also saw how Paul was a deadbeat dad and this was a major turnoff for her. But, before anything, she knew that staying with him would only lead her down a dark path. His history speaks for itself.' \nHowever, a few weeks later, Spears and Soliz sparked concerns that they were back together when they dined at Soho House in Malibu. \nAnd in May of last year, Paul's ex Nicole Mancilla claimed that he fails to support any of his nine kids. \nShe further alleged that he cheated on her with Britney and is being chased for child support by Nicole as well as the Los Angeles Department for Child Support Services (DCSS). \nHis ex told DailyMail.com: 'Just let them know that my husband fell in Britney Spears' p****. He was married, and now he denies his children. He neglects his children for her.'\n\nA separate insider told DailyMail.com , 'She chose her children and her well-being over Paul. They did not get along and, in fact, he did not treat her how she deserves to be treated'\n'He's the EBT Nick Cannon,' she continued, adding that at the time he was residing with Britney but listed his official address at a nearby residence. \n'He's on probation, so if he officially lives at her house, they have access to searching her house. So that's why he still has an address here,' Mancilla alleged. \nNicole's mother Sandra Smith called Soliz a 'deadbeat dad' and claimed he 'doesn't support any' of his kids. \nAnd in October 2024, Nicole officially filed for divorce from Paul and cited 'irreconcilable differences,' per TMZ. \nBack in May of last year, Spears notably sparked mental health concerns when she was pictured barefoot outside of the Chateau Marmont in Hollywood following an alleged fight with Paul. \nAt the time, the pair were spotted at the iconic hotel as the pop star was escorted towards emergency services. \nSources told Us Weekly that close friends of Britney are 'wary of Paul's intentions' while one insider added, 'They don't think he's a good fit for her.'\nAnother shared, 'They have tried for months to tell her to stop associating with him, but the more they tell her to stay away, it has the reverse effect. She isn't listening to them.'\n\nSources told Us Weekly that close friends of Britney are 'wary of Paul's intentions' while one insider added, 'They don't think he's a good fit for her'\n\nDuring a recent interview on the Sibling Rivalry podcast, Sam admitted that he was 'not sad' their marriage came to an end; seen in 2019 in Hollywood \nHer on-and-off romance with the ex-felon comes after her divorce from Sam Asghari. \nThe pair had tied the knot in 2022, but after only 14 months of marriage he filed for divorce - and they reached a settlement in May 2024. \nAsghari has since moved on following the separation and is now dating Brooke Irvine. \nDuring a recent interview on the Sibling Rivalry podcast, Sam admitted that he was 'not sad' their marriage came to an end. \n'Divorce and break-ups suck for anybody but I always had the mindset of \"I'm not sad it's over.\" I'm grateful and happy that it happened.'\n\n'Divorce and break-ups suck for anybody but I always had the mindset of \"I'm not sad it's over.\" I'm grateful and happy that it happened,' the actor added \nHe added, 'It was a very difficult time, we were in a relationship for seven years and there was so much we went through as a couple and it was a beautiful experience. You have to just appreciate that it ever happened than to dwell and be sad.'\nHe later reflected on her conservatorship which came to an end in 2021 and said, 'That was the most difficult and weird spiral thing that I've witnessed in my life.' \nHowever, Asghari explained he did his best to offer support to the pop star. 'I think the best thing to do is to provide support in that moment and that's what I did, I provided as much as I could.' \n'This was my experience in life that I had to go through very gently because if you do anything wrong, you say the wrong thing...' \nBritney SpearsSam Asghari\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBritney Spears, 43, is 'back together' with ex-felon Paul Soliz, 37... after splitting seven months ago\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nCelebrity chef Gino D'Acampo hit with multiple allegations of 'sexually inappropriate and intimidating behaviour' over 12-year period\n\nLauryn Goodman 'will move to Italy NEXT WEEK' as she follows footballer Kyle Walker abroad amid his marital woes with Annie Kilner\n\nBianca Censori reveals how she really felt about controversial naked red carpet stunt as Kanye West boasts that he and wife'beat the Grammys'\n\nMOLLY CLAYTON: Lottie Moss has branded me 'jealous' after I revealed our encounter from hell.

He had previously served as the 45th president from 2017 to 2021. Trump’s historic victory over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the November 2024 elections marked one of the most significant political comebacks in contemporary US history. The inauguration ceremony, attended by several prominent world leaders, was held inside the U.S. Capitol Rotunda.\n\nAside from former President Grover Cleveland, who served as both the 22nd and 24th president, Trump is only the second individual in over 230 years of American governance to regain the presidency after losing re-election. While several citizens and celebrities rejoiced upon Trump’s win. Several others also frowned in unhappiness.\n\nSome of these celebrities were serious enough to claim that they would reportedly leave the country if Donald Trump won. Today, most of the stars should have packed their bags and decided to backtrack on what they said. Although the statement now seems absurd. On a lighter note, take a look at the names of a few “Trump Opposers” below.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nAs per The List, back in October 2023, pop superstar Cher told The Guardian she did not want the billionaire to rise to power again. “I almost got an ulcer the last time,” she told the outlet. “If he gets in, who knows? This time I will leave [the country].” The singer has long been vocal on social media about her political views, opposing Donald Trump during his presidency and appearing at multiple campaign rallies in support of Joe Biden. Moreover, she often expresses her political views on X ( formerly Twitter) During the elections, as per The Independent, Cher claimed that the Republican Party is using new voting laws in Georgia to push through “white supremacy.”.\n\nShe strongly posted, “‘VOTER SUPPRESSION’,” Cher tweeted. “2 Words That Define Immoral Republican Pols. They Bring Jim Crow Back, Wrap Themselves In The [flag emoji] & Have Gone 2 ‘Whites Only’ 2 [stop sign emoji] BLK, ETHNIC,& POOR DEMS FROM VOTING,& WINNING.” She continued: “IF THERE R NO DEMS 2 PROTECT, Gop WILL ACHIEVE THE DREAM THEY’VE [prayer hands emoji] 4. ‘WHITE SUPREMACY’.”\n\nReports suggest that Cher reportedly did not leave the country as her boyfriend Alexander Edwards has a young son named Slash whom he shares with ex-girlfriend Amber Rose, and Cher doesn’t want to pull Edwards out of the country and away from him. Moreover, she gave the interview mentioned above when she was single.\n\nLaverne Cox\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nThe famous TV star and LGBTQ activist told the outlet Variety after Donald Trump’s win in an interview that she was concerned about the safety and security of the LGBTQ community in the country. “We’re doing research on different cities in Europe and in the Caribbean,” she told the outlet.\n\nCox also believed that a second Trump term would resemble the Weimar Republic, the era in Germany following World War I and preceding the Nazi rise to power in World War II. She noted that Berlin had a flourishing queer community before Nazism emerged, stating, “They attacked Jewish people, immigrants, and queer and trans individuals.”\n\nGiven the president’s actions toward transgender people in his initial weeks in office, it’s understandable why she feared it. Her fears probably came true as Donald Trump announced upon his return to the White House that the U.S. will now only recognize two genders, male and female. While several people took to X and sighed, saying that some normalcy had returned, others strongly condemned the future of the country.\n\nSharon Stone\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA few months before the 2024 elections, actress Sharon Stone told the Daily Mail that if Donald Trump were to win again, she’d probably move to Europe. “I am certainly considering a house in Italy. I think that’s an intelligent construct at this time.” She also spoke about her dislike of Trump and added, “This is one of the first times in my life that I’ve actually seen anyone running for office on a platform of hate and oppression.” However, the actress still lives in America! We wonder when she will move and fulfill her European dream of living in Italy.\n\nBarbra Streisand\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nIn November 2023, a year before the election, veteran singer Barbra Streisand announced on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that she would leave the U.S. if Donald Trump won a second term. “I will move. I can’t live in this country if he became president,” she stated. When asked where she would go, The Way We Were singer mentioned Europe, saying, “Probably to England. I like England.”\n\nWhile her words showcased her dislike for Trump, she has also written articles about why Trump should not be elected Commander in Chief, first for HuffPost in 2016 and then for the outletVariety in 2020. While her article strongly does not support Trump’s rule. She also mentions, “Trump can never live up to Obama’s legacy, so he’s trying to erase it.” In addition, she has also publicly made jabs at Donald Trump’s ideologies and administration.","summary":"Several Hollywood celebrities reportedly claimed to leave the country if Donald Trump wins the elections.

California Governor Talk Grows","text":"Speculation is mounting about former Vice President Kamala Harris' political future, with growing chatter about a potential run for California governor.It comes as California Attorney General Rob Bonta said he won't run for California governor in 2026 and instead endorsed Harris for the position.Newsweek has contacted Harris for comment via email.Why It MattersThere is currently no front-runner or clear successor to replace Gavin Newsom as California governor.Some Democrats believe that if Harris were to run, she would start ahead of the pack, with national name recognition, a much-coveted mailing list and a deep bench of volunteers and would have a \"field-clearing effect\" on the Democratic nomination.What To KnowWhile Harris has not said if she intends to run, following her presidential election loss in November, she reportedly instructed her advisers to keep her options open for either a 2026 gubernatorial campaign in her home state or a presidential bid in 2028.\"I am staying in the fight,\" she repeated during phone calls, Politico reported in November.Harris reportedly discussed other paths forward with family over the holidays, Politico reported, citing five people in Harris' inner circle.Harris would be California's first female governor. She previously enjoyed a successful career in California politics, serving as San Francisco district attorney and later as state attorney general and U.S. senator. She also previously opened a campaign account to raise money to run for governor before closing it in 2018.A poll from UC Berkeley and the Los Angeles Times, conducted in October, showed Harris with a substantial advantage over other candidates for the 2026 California gubernatorial race.According to the poll, about 72 percent of Democrats said they would be very likely or somewhat likely support Harris, compared with 8 percent of Republicans and 38 percent of voters with no party preference. Democrats in the state have a 2-1 voter registration advantage over Republicans. There have not been any polls since.On Wednesday, pressure on Harris to run escalated when Bonta endorsed her after saying he wouldn't run.\"I would support her if she ran, I've always supported her in everything she's done. She would be field-clearing,\" Politico quoted the attorney general as saying.Bonta considered running for governor last year but changed his mind after Donald Trump defeated Harris in the presidential race, according to the outlet.However, allies of Harris noted that she is a long way from making a decision.Donna Brazile, a political strategist whom Politico described as a \"close ally\" of the former vice president, noted that she has earned \"a lot of political capital.\"\"You don't squander that by making snap decisions,\" she said.\"She doesn't have to decide if she wants to run for something again in the next six months,\" a former Harris campaign aide told Politico in November. \"The natural thing to do would be to set up some type of entity that would give her the opportunity to travel and give speeches and preserve her political relationships.\"Democratic pollster Paul Maslin added: \"There is no one—no one—who actually can relate to what she's been through these last four months. No one. And I wouldn't begrudge her at all to take some time and figure this out.\"Brian Brokaw, who managed Harris' campaign for California attorney general, said that Harris \"has no idea what her next move is.\"\"She is not someone who makes rash decisions,\" he said, adding that he ultimately does not think Harris will run for governor.If Harris chooses to run for governor, she would not be the first vice president to do so after losing a presidential election. Richard Nixon was denied the presidency in 1960, then the governor's mansion two years later, telling reporters, in part: \"You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore, because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference,\" according to the Richard Nixon Foundation. Eight years later, he won the presidency. It is not clear if Harris plans to run for the presidency again.What People Are SayingBrian Brokaw, who managed Harris' campaign for California attorney general, told Politico: \"I would pretty much guarantee you she has no idea what her next move is.

Nobody knows anything. She's famous enough to look credible in early polling. That's all we know for sure. Does that predict the future?

Republican candidate Donald Trump claimed the interview was misleadingly edited to Harris' benefit and demanded investigations—which he, as the newly elected president, could potentially order.\n\nThis week, CBS released the transcript and raw footage of the interview, demonstrating how pointless the controversy always was but also potentially setting a dangerous precedent for the future of news media.\n\nIn October, CBS News correspondent Bill Whitaker interviewed Harris for 60 Minutes. The interview that aired in the primetime broadcast lasted about 20 minutes and showed Whitaker and Harris speaking in the vice presidential residence, interspersed with footage from a \"walk and talk\" conversation and a joint interview with Harris and former Rep. Liz Cheney (R–Wyo.), who had endorsed and was campaigning with her.\n\nThe day before the interview aired, CBS played a clip on its Sunday morning Face the Nation, but Harris' answer was different than what later aired in the primetime broadcast.\n\nIn the Face the Nation clip, Whitaker asks Harris about Israel's ongoing war in Gaza and the Biden administration's dealings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. When Whitaker notes that it seems Netanyahu \"is not listening,\" Harris responds, \"Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of, many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.\"\n\nBut on the 60 Minutes broadcast, in response to the same question, Harris replies, \"We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.\"\n\nIn a post on X with a video comparing the clips, Trump said the edit was \"totally illegal\" and constituted \"Election Interference.\"\n\n A giant Fake News Scam by CBS & 60 Minutes. Her REAL ANSWER WAS CRAZY, OR DUMB, so they actually REPLACED it with another answer in order to save her or, at least, make her look better. A FAKE NEWS SCAM, which is totally illegal. TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE. Election Interference.… pic.twitter.com/JRxSda3NeC — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2024\n\n\"She gave an answer that was from a loony bin,\" Trump claimed two weeks later at a campaign rally. \"They said, 'We can't have that.' They took the answer out in its entirety, threw it away, and they put another answer in. And I think it's the biggest scandal in broadcasting history.\"\n\nCBS denied any wrongdoing, saying in a statement that the excerpt \"used a longer section of her answer than that on 60 Minutes. Same question. Same answer. But a different portion of the response.\" In a second statement, the network clarified that \"the interview was not doctored\" and that \"60 Minutes did not hide any part of Vice President Kamala Harris's answer to the question at issue.\"\n\n\"The American people deserve the full, unedited transcript from Kamala's sit-down interview,\" Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson at the time, told the New York Post in a statement. Trump later sued CBS, alleging consumer fraud and requesting $10 billion in damages.\n\nThe Center for American Rights, a conservative nonprofit, filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) alleging \"news distortion.\" In January, the FCC requested the \"full, unedited transcript and camera feeds\" from the interview.\n\nThis week, CBS released the transcript and raw footage online. Together, they make clear how pointless this controversy truly was.\n\nHere is Harris' full answer to Whitaker's question, as quoted in the transcript and backed up by the footage:\n\nWell, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. And we're not going to stop doing that. We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end. \n\nSo…Harris' full, unedited answer is a combination of what aired in primetime and what aired on Sunday morning, separated only by the interstitial phrase \"and we're not going to stop doing that.\"\n\nEven if the cuts had been heavier, it is perfectly within a journalist's discretion to edit an interviewee's answers for purposes of clarity or brevity, so long as the edit does not distort the answer's intent: NPR's Ethics Handbook says it assures that \"the people we speak with know that the discussions will be edited—but that we will be true to the meaning of their words.\"\n\nGranted, neither of Harris' answers is particularly compelling; the first part, which aired on Face the Nation, is superficial, and her delivery is halting and stilted. And the portion that played in primetime, while more forceful and succinct, doesn't quite answer Whitaker's prompt.\n\nBut to say this constitutes a scandal—much less, as Trump claimed, that CBS switched out one answer for another—is simply false.\n\nThe release of the transcript and raw footage lays bare just how fake the controversy always was, but it also establishes a dangerous precedent.\n\nFormer CBS executive Jay Newman told CNN's Brian Stelter that the network had always \"aggressively protected outtakes and raw video\" because \"the strong feeling was these were considered 'work product' – akin to a reporter's notes.\"\n\n\"The precedent set by releasing these to a government agency is abhorrent,\" Newman added. Not to mention the precedent set by caving to Trump, who is famously both litigious and hostile to media he sees as unfavorable.\n\nThe New York Times reported last week that even though Trump's lawsuit against CBS was widely seen as frivolous, executives at Paramount, CBS' parent company, were considering settling so as to \"increase the odds that the Trump administration does not block or delay their planned multibillion-dollar merger.\" At the same time, journalists at CBS opposed any settlement over \"[what] they consider tantamount to a politician's standard-issue gripes about a news organization's editorial judgment.\"\n\nWhile the 60 Minutes transcript and footage show CBS didn't do anything wrong, their release still sets a precedent that Trump can bully a news outlet into submission for nothing more than reporting news he doesn't like.","summary":"Donald Trump's complaints were always meritless, but CBS' capitulation sets a dangerous precedent for the future of the news media.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/02/06/transcript-proves-the-60-minutes-scandal-was-always-fake/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/02/kamala-harris-bill-whitaker-60-minutes-cbs.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 17:30:22","author":"Jeff Luse,Joe Lancaster","authors":["Jeff Luse","Joe Lancaster"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.465},{"id":287807052,"title":"Liz Cheney to Elon Musk regarding her past work at USAID: 'Damn Right'","text":"Former Rep.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy REBECCA LAWRENCE FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:17:05 GMT, 6 February 2025 |Updated:17:12 GMT, 6 February 2025 \n\nLauryn Goodman is reportedly set to move to Italy next week in order to be closer to former flame Kyle Walker. \nKyle, 34, is currently abroad playing for AC Milan, with reports claiming that his relationship with wife Annie Kilner, 33, is so strained that they are 'barely talking' and in 'separate rooms'. \nTensions were said to have risen between the pair following the rumours that Kyle's ex-mistress Lauryn could move to Italy too, with her and Kyle's two children. \nNow it seems Lauryn has followed through, with a source telling The Sun: 'Lauryn wants to be as accommodating as she can. She always wants to do the best for her children.\n'Lauryn was happy when Kyle signed for Italy as Saudi would’ve been a bit too far and would feel more final, but Italy was a stone's throw away.\n'It felt a lot closer than her commute to Cheshire with how busy the roads can be... Lauryn is excited for new adventures with her children.'\n\nLauryn Goodman is reportedly set to move to Italy next week in order to be closer to former flame Kyle Walker, with whom she shares two young children \n\nKyle, 34, is currently abroad playing for AC Milan, with reports claiming that his relationship with wife Annie Kilner, 33, is so strained that they are 'barely talking' (pictured in 2019) \nIt marks a U-turn from Lauryn's past remarks, who last week claimed she 'wished' to have the option to relocate abroad after being embroiled in an affair and 'intrusive' court case with the footballer.\nThe family court showdown saw her slammed for 'treating the footballer as an open-ended check book' by the judge as she insisted 'I'll never give up on my kids.'\nIn an interview with The Mirror on Saturday, Lauryn addressed her plans, admitting 'Kyle could be on Mars' for all she cares.\nShe explained: 'For the last year I wished to have the option to move abroad because, with all of the drama, I’d like a life reset, but I’m not sure how that looks for us at the minute or what that entails.\n'It makes no difference to me where [Kyle] is, he could be on Mars right now for all I care.'\nMailOnline has contacted Lauryn's representatives for comment. \nLauryn's supposed move could cause more issues between Annie and Kyle - who have four children of their own.\nThe couple were said to be planning to 'put things behind them' after their marriage was nearly destroyed last year when Kyle was revealed to be the father of both of Lauryn's children. \nA source told MailOnline: 'This is a good opportunity to put things behind them and make a go of it as a family unit. It will be a challenge in a new country, but they are willing to give it a go.'\n\nThe move to Italy was said to be an attempt for a 'clean break' for Kyle and Annie after a rocky past few years (Kyle pictured signing his AC Milan contract last week)\nLast year, Annie filed for divorce and kicking the footballer out of the family home in Cheshire, after she discovered he had secretly fathered a second child with Lauryn.\nAn insider said: 'The couple are committed to keeping their family as united as possible and protecting their four boys from any fallout.\n'They enjoyed Christmas together, as a family, and continue to work on their own relationship but as yet no decisions have been made.'\nThey added: 'They would love time and peace away from the spotlight and rumours to be able to continue working on things behind the scenes.'\nNow, friends of the couple have said that their marriage is 'as bad as it's ever been' after the footballer failed to discuss his AC Milan move with Annie.\nThe pair allegedly 'couldn't bring themselves to say goodbye to one another' before the footballer jetted off to Milan.\nIt was previously reported Annie stood her ground and stayed home to celebrate her friend's 40th birthday following an alleged row with Kyle. \nAnnie had initially been set to arrive in Italy last month with their sons, Roman, 11, Riaan, seven, Reign, five, and nine-month-old baby Rezon, before being delayed first by the stormy weather and then by the fresh row.\n\nIt was previously reported Annie stood her ground and stayed home to celebrate her friend's 40th birthday following an alleged row with Kyle\n\nEXCLUSIVE Annie Kilner turns down £750K offer to star in Celebrity Big Brother \nThe WAG eventually relented and flew out from Manchester City on a private jet with her children to meet Kyle for his AC Milan debut.\nWhile hopes were rising for a fresh start in Milan as a family, friends have said all is not what it seems as Annie is still contemplating joining him.\nA friend reportedly told The Sun: 'That's how strained things are at the moment. It's as bad as it's ever been. He didn't even sit her down and discuss moving to Italy. He just said \"I'm going, it's up to you if you come with me\".\n'They're not in a great place and are barely talking. It's still unclear if Annie will actually join him permanently in Italy.\n'Everything is up in the air but, then again, it's been like this ever since the scandal was exposed.'\nThe WAG was said to be 'sick and tired' of dropping everything for her husband Kyle.\nBefore jetting off to Milan, Annie was pictured enjoying various events at home, keeping her followers updated by sharing photos to Instagram.\nA friend told MailOnline: ‘Annie was really excited about the party as it was going to be one of the first times she’d let her hair down since Rezon. \n'When the news came of Kyle’s signing, she was torn between going straight over and sticking to her original plans.'\nThey added: 'She made a promise at new year to put herself first every now and then so did just that - she knew there were lots of opportunities ahead to visit Milan to support Kyle ahead of the family move should the contact become permanent.' \n\nAnnie had initially been set to arrive in Italy last month with their sons, Roman, 11, Riaan, seven, Reign, five, and nine-month-old baby Rezon, before being delayed first by the stormy weather and then by the fresh row (pictured with kids in 2023) \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLauryn Goodman 'will move to Italy NEXT WEEK' as she follows footballer Kyle Walker abroad amid his marital woes with Annie Kilner\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nStrictly's Shirley Ballas, 64, shares the savage eating habit she's adopted to maintain her size 10 figure\n\nEXCLUSIVEJames Argent packs on the PDA with bikini-clad girlfriend Nicoline Artursson as they enjoy a romantic beach day during Barbados holiday \n\nNow Kanye breaks the internet!

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy MADISON BURGESS \n Published:16:39 GMT, 6 February 2025 |Updated:17:08 GMT, 6 February 2025 \n\nOzzy Osbourne admitted he 'can't stand up right' in a heartbreaking interview less than a year ago - and fans are voicing concerns over the rocker's health after he announced Black Sabbath's final ever gig.\nThe musician, whose health has delayed he and wife Sharon's move back to the UK, has undergone seven surgeries in the past five years, including a fourth spinal surgery in September 2023, and has been battling Parkinson’s disease since 2003. \nIt was revealed on Wednesday that his band is preparing to reunite for the first time in 20 years alongside a host of other big names.\nThe original line-up of heavy metal legends Black Sabbath will play together at a one-off concert in Birmingham, UK, this summer.\nThe show will take place on July 5 at the birthplace of the band and will feature Ozzy, 76, Tommy, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward.\nHowever, it came as an unexpected move as in a March 2024 interview with Rolling Stone, Ozzy admitted he wasn't optimistic about being on stage again.\n\nOzzy Osbourne admitted he 'can't stand up right' in a heartbreaking interview from less than a year ago, as fans are voicing concerns over the rocker's health\n\nThe musician has undergone seven surgeries in the past five years, including a fourth spinal surgery in September 2023, and has been battling Parkinson’s disease since 2003 (pictured in 1992)\nWhen quizzed on the possibility, he responded: 'I would love to, but I can't stand up right. Maybe I'll do something one day. I miss it terribly.'\nThe star was then asked if he would consider doing ' a short set if inducted into the Rock Hall,' to which he responded: 'Maybe. We'll see.' \nThe British musician was diagnosed with a mild form of Parkinson's disease in 2003, however he only went public with the condition in 2020.\nHowever, Ozzy has said that his biggest struggles are due to a fall which he suffered in 2019 which caused metal rods in his back to dislodge.\nThe rods had been put there following a quad bike accident at his Buckinghamshire home in 2003.\nHe told Rolling Stone UK magazine: 'The second surgery went drastically wrong and virtually left me crippled.\n'I thought I'd be up and running after the second and third, but with the last one they put a f*ing rod in my spine.\n'They found a tumour in one of the vertebrae, so they had to dig all that out too. It's pretty rough, man, and my balance is all f*ed up.'\nThe Prince of Darkness also said how he has 'ten tears left' to live as he recalled a disagreed with his wife over smoking cannabis.\n\nHowever, in a March 2024 interview Ozzy admitted he wasn't optimistic about being on stage again \n\nBlack Sabbath pictured in the 70s - L-R: (back) Geezer Butler, Tony Iommi, (front) Bill Ward, Ozzy Osbourne - posed, group shot \n\n Sharon Osbourne emerges for the first time in months as she supports husband Ozzy \n'[Sharon] said, \"What are you doing that for! It'll f****** kill you!\" I said, \"How long do you want me to f****** live for?!\"'.\nGoing on to say: 'At best, I've got ten years left and when you're older, time picks up speed. Me and Sharon had our 41st wedding anniversary recently, and that's just unbelievable to me!'.\nSharon, who shares three children with the star, described her husband's numerous surgeries as 'five years of heartache'.\n'I've just felt so helpless and so bad for Ozzy, to see him going through the pain. He's gone through all these operations and the whole thing has felt like a nightmare'.\nShe continued: 'He hasn't lost his sense of humour, but I look at my husband, and he's here while everyone else is out on the road. This is the longest time he hasn't ever worked for. Being at home for so long has been so foreign to him'.\nOzzy also explained his previous devestation of being unable to do one last gig for his fans, after being forced to cancel his tour in 2023.\n'That’s one of the things I’ve been the most fucking pissed off at: I never got the chance to say goodbye or thank you'.\nBefore adding: 'That’s my goal to work to. To do those shows. I just want to be well enough to do one show where I can say :\"Hi guys, thanks so much for my life\".\n\nSharon, who shares three children with the star, described her husband's numerous surgeries as 'five years of heartache' (pictured 2017)\n\nThe British musician was diagnosed with a mild form of Parkinson's disease in 2003, however he only went public with the condition in 2020 (pictured 2014)\n'That’s what I’m working towards, and if I drop down dead at the end of it, I’ll die a happy man.'\nIn October 2024, the Black Sabbath star joked: 'I'm nearly f***ing dead!' as he opened up about his health issues and the complication that causes him the most issues. \nIn an interview with The Sun, Ozzy revealed he hasn't walked properly since he underwent a surgery after his fall in 2019.\nThe star went into more details as he revealed he tripped during a bathroom visit in the night and fell over and landed wrong. \nHe explained: 'I went to the doctor's and you assume everybody knows what they're doing. My son Jack has a video of me going into surgery, saying, \"I'll see you in a few minutes\". I haven't walked properly since.'\nOzzy confessed he believes too much blame for his predicament has been placed on his Parkinson's diagnosis.\nHe argued: 'I mean, when I came off the quad bike in 2003, I still did tours and I had Parkinson's back then. It was THAT f*****g surgery.'\nSharon and Ozzy's move back to the UK was delayed for months due to his various health struggles.\nOn a July 2023 episode of The Osbournes, which co-stars the couple's kids Kelly and Jack Osbourne, Sharon said, 'It just seems that every time we're set to go [back to England], something happens with Ozzy’s health.' \n\nIn October 2024, the Black Sabbath star joked: 'I'm nearly f***ing dead!' as he opened up about his health issues and the complication that causes him the most issues \n\nOzzy previously confessed he believes too much blame for his predicament has been placed on his Parkinson's diagnosis.\n\n'We'll get there,' Sharon said, adding, 'We wanna go back so bad, but we'll get there. Won't we, Ozzy?' \nThe pair first announced their plans to relocate overseas, where they're from, in August 2022 - and they finally became a reality in November 2023.\nWhile many fans of the band are ecstatic and anxiously waiting to be able to try and get their hands on tickets, some have highlighted concerns over whether Ozzy will be well enough to perform.\nTaking to X, formerly Twitter, concerned fans said: 'Wonder if this will really happened! Ozzy’s health hasn’t been that great! I hope so, though! Sure sounds cool!';\n'The big question is will Ozzy make it to that stage? Hopefully they will make arrangements that make it easier and safe for him to perform with his health issues,';\n'I hate to be that guy, but there's no chance this actually happens right? Ozzy hasn't performed in years due to his health and canceled multiple appearances/shows. Line-up is insane though lol,';\n'Not that long ago, Ozzy barely could give an acceptance speech on the Rock And Roll HOF, while being seated. Really hoping that his health and condition improved since then. But that being said, hardly feasible that Ozzy will be in singing condition,';\n'Considering Ozzy and Geezer’s health I fear this will end up being incredibly sad to go watch, I can’t see how Ozzy will be able to do a set at all,';\n'Wondering how long Sabbath will play for with that amount of bands and with Ozzy's health.'\n\nWhile many fans are ecstatic and anxiously waiting to be able to try and get their hands on tickets, some have highlighted concerns over whether Ozzy will be well enough to perform (Seen with daughter Kelly in 2020)\n\nTaking to X, formerly Twitter, concerned fans said: ' Wonder if this will really happened! Ozzy’s health hasn’t been that great! I hope so, though! Sure sounds cool!\n\nMeanwhile MailOnline readers echoed their sentiments as they said: 'How can he do it? He has Parkinson’s both his movements and voice will be seriously impeded'\n\n Ozzy Osbourne, 76, announces final Black Sabbath gig as band reunite for first time in 20 years \nMeanwhile MailOnline readers echoed their sentiments as they said: 'How can he do it? He has Parkinson’s both his movements and voice will be seriously impeded. Good luck to them but I think there will be a lot of backing support from sound engineers and singers,'; \n'Went to see them in Birmingham when the original line up got back together. What a fantastic night. Not sure if Oz can perform as he did back then, but if Jagger can still do it, why not.?';\n'It wasn’t that long ago Sharon said her and Ozzy wanted to live back in the UK because of the Gun violence in America but said he wasn’t well enough to travel,sounds like a miracle has happened so let’s see if they come back now he seems healthier.'\nOzzy's wife Sharon was at the announcement of the new show at Birmingham's Villa Park, the concert venue, on Wednesday alongside the band's guitarist Tony Iommi.\nSharon proudly held up a Villa football shirt with Ozzy's name on the back as she posed pitchside.\nThe group pioneered heavy metal music in the early 1970s with hits such as War Pigs, Paranoid and Iron Man.\nSince their last gig together in 2005, Black Sabbath has played in partial reunions but never in their original line-up.\nOzzy's wife Sharon Osbourne has also admitted the show will be a testing experience for the star.\nShe told The Sun: 'He’s very happy to be coming back and very emotional about this. Parkinson’s is a progressive disease.\n'It’s not something you can stabilise. It affects different parts of the body and it’s affected his legs. But his voice is as good as it’s ever been.'\nProfits from the show will be shared equally between the charities Cure Parkinson's, Birmingham Children's Hospital and Acorn Children's Hospice, with the Parkinson's charity being selected by Sharon and Ozzy.\n\nWhat is Parkinson's ? \n\nParkinson's is a neurodegenerative condition. The illness effects the nerve cells in the brain that control movement.\nOver time the symptoms gradually get worse. It can cause symptoms related to movement as well as pain, depression and loss of smell. \nMost people who get Parkinson's are over 60, but one in ten are under 50 and it affects more men than women. \nWhat causes the symptoms?\nNerve cells in the brain send messages to the rest of out body to control our movements. This is done using chemicals called neurotransmitters.\nAn area of the brain called the substantia nigra produces one of the neurotransmitters that controls movement: dopamine. But in 70 to 80 per cent of people with Parkinson's these dopamine producing cells deteriorate and die. \nThe loss of dopamine-producing neurons results in low levels of dopamine in the part of the brain that controls movement and balance.\nSource: Parkinson's Europe \nOzzy OsbourneBirmingham\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nOzzy Osbourne admits he 'can't stand up right' in heartbreaking interview less than a year ago - as rocker, 76, sparks concern by announcing final Black Sabbath gig while he battles Parkinson's and spinal issues\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nStrictly's Shirley Ballas, 64, shares the savage eating habit she's adopted to maintain her size 10 figure\n\nEXCLUSIVEJames Argent packs on the PDA with bikini-clad girlfriend Nicoline Artursson as they enjoy a romantic beach day during Barbados holiday \n\nNow Kanye breaks the internet!

What to know","text":"Former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney has attacked the world’s richest man Elon Musk and drawn attention to the fact that he has not always been a US citizen as part of a social media spat between the pair.\n\nMusk – whose Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is at work scrutinizing the running of the federal government with a view to implementing cost-cutting measures at the behest of new president Donald Trump – began the argument by circulating a post on his X platform drawing attention to Cheney’s early career working for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\nMusk suggested Cheney was “spawned” by USAID, which is tasked with handing out foreign aid and which he is targeting for abolition, earlier this week referring to it as a “criminal organization” without explaining himself.\n\nDozens of agency officials have since been placed on leave and billions of dollars have been frozen as the Trump administration attempts to merge it with the State Department.\n\nCheney did indeed work for USAID before she enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School in 1996 and again during the George W Bush administration, serving on projects in Hungary and Poland.\n\nNow a pariah to the MAGA movement for working on the House committee that investigated January 6 and for campaigning with Kamala Harris in last year’s election, Cheney responded to the billionaire’s post about her USAID background by saying: “Damn right, Elon. I’m proud of what America did to win the Cold War, defeat Soviet communism, and defend democracy.\n\n“Our nation stood for freedom. You may be unfamiliar with that part of our history since you weren’t yet an American citizen.”\n\nIn light of her comments, here’s a look at Musk’s citizenship status and what it might mean for his future political ambitions.\n\nDoes Elon Musk have American citizenship?\n\nYes. Although Musk was born and raised in Pretoria, South Africa, he emigrated to the United States as a student in 1992 and obtained American citizenship in 2002, according to Walter Isaacson’s 2023 biography of the tech entrepreneur.\n\nMusk himself said in an X post last year that he originally arrived in the country on a J-1 visa, which permits foreign students to study in the U.S., before transitioning to a H-1B temporary work visa.\n\nCan he run for the White House?\n\nNo he cannot. The US Constitution says that only people who are natural-born citizens are eligible to become American presidents. \n\nHowever, naturalized citizens may hold other high federal offices, including within an America-born president’s cabinet.\n\nWhere else does he have citizenship?\n\nIn addition to his American citizenship, Musk also retains South Africa citizenship and is also a Canadian citizen through his mother Maye Musk, who was born and raised in Canada but lived most of her adult life in South Africa. \n\nHer connection to the country enabled Elon to obtain a Canadian passport in 1989 and study for two years at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, before arriving in the U.S.\n\nWhat citizenship do his children have?\n\nElon Musk has fathered 12 children in total, the first six of which were born to his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, between 2002 and 2006, with the couple’s first born Nevada tragically passing away from sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks.\n\nHe has more recently had two more children with the Canadian pop star Grimes and a further three with Canadian tech executive and venture capitalist Shivon Zilis.\n\nMusk’s children all have Canadian citizenship thanks to the shared nationality of their three mothers while any born in the United States will also have automatic American citizenship, assuming Trump does not succeed in ending the principle of birthright citizenship, which he has attempted to do as part of his crackdown on illegal immigration but which has already faced a series of legal challenges.","summary":"Tech entrepreneur attacked by ex-congresswoman Liz Cheney in latest online spat","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/elon-musk-citizenship-us-south-africa-canada-b2693635.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/28/10/GettyImages-2188411433.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/sS4lUh5e-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-06 17:04:00","author":"Joe Sommerlad","authors":["Joe Sommerlad"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.188},{"id":287800742,"title":"Tesla sales plunge across Europe but rise in Ireland","text":"In Germany, the US manufacturer registered only 1,277 new cars in January, its lowest monthly total since July 2021, according to the German Federal Motor Transport Authority.\n\nTesla lost substantial ground in an EV market that was up 54% for the month. Musk’s intervention in Germany’s upcoming federal election likely factored in the result — a poll taken in mid-January found the CEO was viewed unfavourably, and that his political interventions were unwelcome.\n\nTesla also posted declines in France and the UK last month, meaning its sales fell in Europe’s three largest EV markets. In addition to vouching for Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany party and taking on UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Musk spent the month cementing his position in the administration of US President Donald Trump, who’s threatened to hit the European Union with tariffs.\n\nIn Ireland, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI) shows Tesla car sales rose last month to 143 cars compared to 66 sold in January 2023. \n\nThe January sales figures show Tesla's position amongst electric vehicle sellers fell to 12th. However, January has been a low-selling month for the company in recent years. Despite low sales last January, Tesla went on to sell the most fully electric vehicles in Ireland last year at 2,926 giving it a 16.8% market share.\n\nThe company’s sales plunged 63% last month in France — the EU’s second-biggest EV market, after Germany — and dropped 12% in the UK. \n\nOther factors outside of politics are likely at play in Tesla’s slow start to the year. The company is changing over assembly plants to produce a redesigned Model Y, its best-selling vehicle, which will cost the manufacturer several weeks of lost production.\n\nTesla also may be contending with shortages of inventory in some markets due to the all-out push the company made to boost sales late last year.\n\nWhile the automaker delivered more vehicles than ever in the fourth quarter, it fell short of a forecast for slight growth for the full year. Instead, the company posted its first annual decline in more than a decade.\n\nBut there have been more signs outside of Europe that Musk’s politics are having an effect on the carmaker he runs. Tesla registered fewer cars in California in all four quarters of 2024, as sales of its second-most important vehicle — the Model 3 — plunged 36% for the year.\n\nCalifornia went for Trump’s opponent Kamala Harris by a wide margin in November, and Musk feuded with Governor Gavin Newsom throughout last year.\n\n Bloomberg and Irish Examiner","summary":"Tesla also posted declines in France and the UK last month, meaning its sales fell in Europe’s three largest EV markets","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/companies/arid-41569396.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8983/4491610_3_seoimage1x1_1549444.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 16:59:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com,Marilen Martin, William Wilkes","authors":["Irishexaminer.com","Marilen Martin, William Wilkes"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.12},{"id":287795376,"title":"Una Healy breaks her silence on split from jockey Aidan Coleman as she enjoys wild night out with ex-husband's former rugby team mate Danny Cipriani","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Feb 6th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Trump peace plan for Ukraine' is 'leaked': Talks with Putin, ceasefire by Easter and an end to Zelensky's NATO dream among details in report\n\nBianca Censori reveals how she really felt about controversial naked red carpet stunt as Kanye West boasts that he and wife 'beat the Grammys'\n\nLauryn Goodman 'will move to Italy NEXT WEEK' as she follows footballer Kyle Walker abroad amid his marital woes with Annie Kilner\n\nTrump gifted a golden pager by Netanyahu to commemorate the devices that blew up terrorists in Lebanon\n\nI thought my bigger belly was middle-aged spread - before I was diagnosed with a rare cancer.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JULIE ANN TRAINOR and LILY JOBSON FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:15:57 GMT, 6 February 2025 |Updated:16:47 GMT, 6 February 2025 \n\nUna Healy has broken her silence on her shock split from Aidan Coleman, just days after she and newly-single Danny Cipriani were pictured leaving in a taxi together at the Celebrity Bear Hunt premiere afterparty.\nThe Saturdays singer, 43, and the retired Irish jockey, 36, reportedly split 'amicably' after several months of dating.\nSpeaking about the heartbreaking split for the first time, Una said her stint on Celebrity Bear Hunt forced her to 'dust herself off and try again' and move 'onwards and upwards'.\nUna praised the Netflix show and Bear Grylls for giving her the boost to keep going amid her breakup.\nWhen asked if she has split from Aidan, she said: 'Yes, I’m not going to talk about that – it’s onwards and upwards.\n'I think I’m prepared for anything coming out of this jungle experience. I feel very tough from it, and I think you have to be tough in life. \n\nUna Healy, 43, has broken her silence on her shock split from Aidan Coleman, 36, just days after she and newly-single Danny Cipriani were pictured leaving in a taxi together at the Celebrity Bear Hunt premiere afterparty (pictured with Aidan in November)\n\nUna and freshly-single Danny enjoyed more quality time after the premiere at Kettners on Tuesday as they shared a taxi home\n'Dust yourself off, try again and believe in yourself – all those things. That’s one of the things Bear Grylls said to me. \n'He gives us all a pep talk, and he said, \"The one thing I admire about you is your never give up attitude\". I would say that to everyone, just never give up.'\nIt comes after Una and her Celebrity Bear Hunt co-star Danny Cipriani enjoyed quality time together after the star-studded afterparty at Kettners on Tuesday as they shared a taxi home.\nThe pair no doubt knew each other before the show, with former rugby WAG Una married to Danny's England teammate Ben Foden. \nUna was married to rugby star Ben from 2012 until 2018 and has Aoife Belle, 11 and nine-year-old Tadhg with him. \nThey divorced after he was unfaithful to her and she started dating Limerick hurler David Breen that year but split with him by February 2020.\nYet prior to working alongside each other on Celebrity Bear Hunt fears were raised that they could end up in a heated situation over Ben's comments from back in 2010.\nIn a previous interview with The Mirror, Ben told the publication that Danny should have focused on his rugby more than his wild antics off the pitch. \n\nOpposite her was retired rugby player Danny, 37, who looked dapper in a black suit and tailored coat (Una pictured behind Danny) \n\nThe Saturdays star Una looked gorgeous in a dark red vinyl Rebecca Vallance dress covered in sparkly detailing as she slipped into the backseat\n\nSpeaking about the heartbreaking split for the first time, Una said her stint on Celebrity Bear Hunt forced her to 'dust herself off and try again' and move 'onwards and upwards'\nHe said at the time: 'My girlfriend is in the limelight more than me. If I am ever pictured with her it's normally, \"Here is Una Healy... and rugby boyfriend Ben Foden\". I'm never going to be the main focus.\n'I've never been a big clubber anyway. It's always been a part of the rugby culture to get drunk - but I do it with the boys! For me, it's rugby, rugby, rugby.\n'Cipriani has been a bit unlucky. He has probably done it a bit too soon. He needed to concentrate on his rugby a little bit more.'\nA source then told The Sun last month: 'Danny is still fuming about it.\n'This will make it awkward for them both as Una tries to keep a good relationship with Ben for sake of her kids and now she has to be around someone who hates her ex.\n'It's not exactly comfortable for either of them and could see them clashing.'\nDanny and Una no doubt had plenty to talk about, given they're both newly single. \nUna candidly spoke of the 'mild form of PTST' she experienced after completing the show. \n\nDanny and Una are pictured with Shirley Ballas on Celebrity Bear Hunt \n\nThe pair no doubt knew each other before the show, with former rugby WAG Una married to Danny's (R) England teammate Ben Foden (L)\n\nUna was married to rugby player Ben Foden before rumours of him cheating put an end to things (pictured together in December 2017) \nShe admitted: 'I did experience a mild form of PTST, and he told me that can happen – it’s very natural, because you’re coming back into your natural environment, but you have adapted this whole new way of life. \n'He prepared me for PTST and I had it, and I had a few aftershocks and nightmares and stuff, but they subsided quite quickly.\nOn Monday, it was claimed Una had split from her Aidan, just a few months after she went public with their romance.\nA source close to the singer confirmed the news to the Irish Mirror, saying the couple have 'split amicably' after several months of dating.\nAnd it seems the retired Irish jockey has already moved on as he's been spotted on the dating app Bumble, with his profile reading that he's looking for 'fun' and 'casual dates'.\nAidan has also recently packed his bags and moved back to England after spending six months in Ireland, where Una currently resides, amid reports of the breakup.\nIn a recent interview with TDN live, he candidly admitted: 'I am not a great sleeper at the best of times but I am very worried about the fact that I moved back to Ireland six months ago but just couldn't settle here. \n'My bags are packed and I am going back to the UK today—a place where I have spent half of my life—but I am worried that this move is not the answer, either. I hope it is. I really do, because I don't want to feel like this for the rest of my life.' \n\nAidan has also recently packed his bags and moved back to England after spending six months in Ireland, where Una currently resides (pictured in 2021)\n\nAnd it seems the retired Irish jockey has already moved on as he's been spotted on the dating app Bumble , with his profile reading that he's looking for 'fun' and 'casual dates'\n\nAfter splitting from her cheating ex in 2018, the Saturdays singer, 42, began dating Limerick hurler David Breen that year but split by February 2020 \n\nIn 2023, Una joked about being 'hoodwinked' into a throuple with boxer David Haye and his girlfriend Sian Osborne, describing the experience as the 'worst six months of my life' \n\n Newly-single Una Healy slips into a taxi with Danny Cipriani\nFollowing her split from Ben, Una struck up a relationship with an unnamed Dublin-based police officer that came to an end in May 2022.\nIt was then reported that she was in a three-way relationship with David Haye, 44, and model Sian Osborne, 31 - fuelling the claims by posting a cosy snap of the trio on holiday in Morocco.\nYet she went on to clarify that she was never actually part of a 'throuple', revealing the only person she was dating was David - although he was simultaneously dating Sian.\nAfter calling an end to her time with David, she was said to be dating the voice of Love Island Australia - Stephen Mullen - in August but they split two months later.\n\nCelebrity Bear Hunt: Meet The Cast!\n\nProfession: Spice Girl, TV presenter and X Factor judge \nLEOMIE ANDERSON\n\nProfession: Model, Victoria's Secret star and TV presenter for BBC Three's Glow Up: \nKOLA BOKINNI\n\nProfession: Actor and Ted Lasso star \n\nProfession: Singer and former member of The Saturdays\nLOTTIE MOSS\n\nProfession: Model and influencer\nSTEPH MCGOVERN\n\nProfession: TV presenter and journalist \n\nSHIRLEY BALLAS\n\nProfession: Former dancer and Strictly Come Dancing's head judge\nBORIS BECKER\n\nProfession: Former tennis star and Wimbledon champion \nLAURENCE LLEWELYN-BOWEN\n\nProfession: Interior design expert and Changing Rooms star\n\nProfession: Rapper and TV chef \nDANNY CIPRIANI\n\nProfession: Retired rugby player\n\nProfession: Actor and Inbetweeners star \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nUna Healy breaks her silence on split from jockey Aidan Coleman as she enjoys wild night out with ex-husband's former rugby team mate Danny Cipriani\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nStrictly's Shirley Ballas, 64, shares the savage eating habit she's adopted to maintain her size 10 figure\n\nEXCLUSIVEJames Argent packs on the PDA with bikini-clad girlfriend Nicoline Artursson as they enjoy a romantic beach day during Barbados holiday \n\nNow Kanye breaks the internet!

I really... I still struggle with it\n'But after I hated myself like beyond belief. Like really, really struggled with my body image. Pregnant - loved, loved, loved it. And then the minute, that minute Abel was born and I was looking at myself in a completely different light, which makes no sense.\n\nThe sweet clip, which looks like it had been recorded on a camcorder, showed the moment the couple find out they were pregnant\n\nThe clip featured adorable family moments between Olivia and Alex, and their son Abel, including the little one kissing his mother's stomach and wearing a shirt that reads 'big brother'\n\nThe couple looked thrilled to be expanding their family \n\nThe couple's first child Abel wore a jumper which read: 'Big Brother 2025'\n\nOlivia also showed off her blossoming baby bump in multiple clips of the video, as the family prepare to become a four\n\nOlivia included a clip of the positive pregnancy test in front of their Christmas tree\n\nShe also recorded the moment she showed Alex that the test was positive\n\nOlivia added that the pregnancy was 'the biggest secret to keep'\n'The fact that you can look at yourself when you're pregnant and absolutely love the way you look and think, \"wow, I'm incredible. I'm carrying this baby\". But then after it was like I was comparing myself to other girls that were in the public eye, that had had kids around the same time as me. \n'And I was looking at them thinking, \"oh my God, you look amazing\" and not thinking about myself and thinking, \"I need to bounce back\".'\nAfter convincing herself that she didn't look great in comparison to others, Olivia embarked on a gruelling exercise routine - which would prove to have a negative effect on her body.\nShe explained: 'I ended up actually really injuring myself because I had a complicated birth. \n'I started running too early because I was so conscious of what I looked like.\n'I ended up breaking my stitches. I ended up... I horse rode too early because I wanted to get fit again, and I caused myself a lot of damage.\n'Not going into too much detail, but I ended up, like, actually really hurting myself from wanting to bounce back.'\nBut despite causing herself physical pain through her actions, the influencer confessed that she would probably still do the same thing again if they had another child.\nShe said: 'It was like... and even now, I think I still wouldn't have done it differently. Really, the first time around... The second... If I got pregnant again, I know to look after myself, but I know for a fact I would have done that again and again and again.\n\nOlivia and Alex, formerly a sales executive and scaffolder respectively, soared to fame in 2016 when they appeared on the ITV2 reality show, where she was an original star and he, a late and extremely popular entrant\n\nAfter leaving the villa their romance soon when from strength to strength and Alex popped the question in New York in December 2016 \n\nThe couple, who have been together for almost a decade, welcomed their first child, son Abel, two, back in June 2022\n\nAfter the birth of her first child, Olivia admitted that she 'really really struggled' with her postpartum figure so much so that she 'hated' herself 'beyond belief' \n\nEXCLUSIVE Olivia Bowen says she has 'bigger things in life to worry about than being f***ing skinny' \n'Like that wouldn't have changed. But I guess it is, you know, my job is on social media. And to see all these girls look so incredible and think that you don't look like that. \n'It was such a hard thing. And because I'd always had such great body confidence and I loved my body, that was just someone I didn't really recognize and I had no respect for. And it's, it's so sad.'\nWhile Olivia struggled with her body image, she also faced a battle with postnatal depression.\nOpening up to Giovanna on not feeling like a mother when Abel was born, she said: 'I remember writing in my notes, actually, I think he was about three months old, and I remember writing in my notes that I didn't want to be looked at as a mum.\n'I was like, I'm not a mum, I don't feel like a mum. I have a baby and I love my baby, but I do not want anyone to look at me or call me mum. \n'I didn't like it when people referred to me as mum. I hated it.'\nAs Giovanna suggested it was due to Olivia perhaps feeling 'lost' amid the traumatic birth, Olivia explained: 'I think it I think it is like the lost feeling afterwards. Like I think that postnatal is just so, so common and we don't even realize it. And I really struggled after, like anxiety wise, I was really depressive.\n'And I do think I was just shunning the image of being a mom because I just so wasn't ready to give up who I was before, and I felt like I'd lost my whole identity. I had no clue who I was. Yeah, like I remember talking to my friends and being like, I literally don't know who I am.\n\nOlivia and Alex tied the knot in a luxurious Essex ceremony two years after meeting on Love Island during series two\n\nSpeaking of postnatal depression, Olivia explained: 'I think it I think it is like the lost feeling afterwards. Like I think that postnatal is just so, so common and we don't even realize it'\n\nAlex and Olivia splashed out around £800,000 in 2017 to purchase their first home in Chelmsford, Essex, before buying Olivia's dream house in 2020 for just over £1 million\n'Like, I could not tell you one thing about myself and to lose yourself like that deeply. And then I think I've always. Because I didn't want kids, I always looked at being a mom as not a bad thing, but just something that was never me.'\nIn August 2024, Olivia explained that she is aware of the fleeting nature of Love Island fame, and decided to begin investing in property, while following her dream of a career in interior design. \nIn a new interview with The Sunday Times, she said: 'I know Love Island won’t last for ever. I’ve got my [influencing] career, which I absolutely adore, but I know things are going to change. Interior design has become something that I want to do with my life.\n'My dad always instilled the importance of property into me and I had that in the back of my mind.'\nAlex and Olivia splashed out around £800,000 in 2017 to purchase their first home in Chelmsford, Essex, before buying Olivia's dream house in 2020 for just over £1 million.\nThe same year they also invested £128,000 into a one-bedroom in Birmingham, to renovate it and then rent it out.\nContinuing to build their buy-to-let property portfolio, the following year they bought a three-bedroom rental property for £175,000.\nThen, they sold their Essex house for £500,000 more than they bought it for and bought a plot in Essex for £250,000 in June 2023. \nFinally moving into to their lavish home last month, the couple proudly displayed the final results of the swanky pad, which features an 'ocean room' for their toddler and even a sweet nod to the Love Island villa in Mallorca where they first met.\nAlex BowenNew YorkOlivia Buckland\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nOlivia Bowen is PREGNANT!

Smith: Why I am seriously considering running for president and how I would WIN\n\nREAD MORE: Shock poll reveals Stephen A.'s chances in 2028 presidential race\n\nPODCAST: Get all the latest news and insider gossip on our new politics show – Welcome to MAGAland\n\nBy DANIEL MATTHEWS and MAX WINTERS\n\nPublished: 12:46 GMT, 6 February 2025 | Updated: 15:46 GMT, 6 February 2025\n\nStephen A. Smith has branded Donald Trump a 'pain in the a**' since his return to the White House and teased a possible presidential bid in 2028.\n\nThe ESPN star also vowed he'd beat 'every candidate' and revealed what would have to happen for him to run for office in a wide-ranging, exclusive interview with DailyMail.com in New Orleans ahead of the Super Bowl.\n\nA recent poll revealed that Smith would receive more support than several big-name Democrat presidential hopefuls in the nation's next election.\n\nThe sports analyst has not shied away from delivering bold political takes in the aftermath of Trump's emphatic victory over Kamala Harris in the polls last November.\n\nAs a result of his hot takes, which have gone viral, Smith has generated a lot of support for a potential presidential bid. \n\nIn recent weeks, Smith shocked Bill Maher's audience with his blunt verdict on why Trump won a second term in the White House - and admitted why he feels like a 'damn fool' for supporting Harris.\n\nStephen A. Smith left the door open for a possible bid for the presidency on Wednesday\n\nThe ESPN star branded Donald Trump 'a pain in the a**' but agreed with some of his policies\n\nAnd, although he has played down the prospect of himself running for office, Smith did leave the door open for a possible presidential run in 2028.\n\nWhen asked what he'll be doing in four years, Smith said: 'I'll still be doing sports, but also my voice will not fade from the political landscape.\n\n'You know, rather than talk about me being an elected official or a runner for the president of the United States, how about if I'm somebody with a voice as strong as Sean Hannity's, as strong as Mark Levin's, as strong as Rachel Maddow. How about that? \n\n'Because that's more plausible. However, I will confess, like I said, I have no desire to do this, but assuming that I'm well off, that I have lots of money, and money is no longer a concern, if the American people came to me and looked at me and said \"Yo, man, we want you to run for office\", and I had a legitimate shot to win the presidency of the United States, I'm not gonna lie. I'll think about that.\n\n'But I gotta have my money. I'm not gonna go to the White House broke. I'm not gonna do that. I gotta have my money. I gotta have my home. I gotta have my financial situation completely taken care of. I have no concerns if that happens for me.\n\n'If they told me I had a legitimate, bonafide shot to win the presidency of the United States of America, I would entertain it.\n\n'Because the part that I'm not joking about is I believe I could beat every candidate on that poll. Every candidate that they mentioned, from Kamala Harris right on down to (Pete) Buttigieg and to Tim Walz. I'd beat all of them. I do believe that. I really do.'\n\nSmith's claims come after John McLaughlin - who was Trump's chief pollster - held a national survey of 1,000 general election voters last month. \n\nSmith has more support than several big-name Democratic presidential hopefuls, a poll said\n\nVoters were asked who they would vote for if the 2028 Democratic primary was held today\n\nAmong the questions he asked was: 'Thinking ahead to the 2028 Democratic primary election for president, if that election were held today among the following candidates, for whom would you vote?'\n\nTwo percent said they would choose ESPN star Smith. That is more than the likes of Beto O'Rourke - who ran for the nomination in 2020 - and JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois (both one percent).\n\nRemarkably, Smith polled only one percentage point behind Tim Walz - Harris' vice-presidential pick - and Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro.\n\nHarris was overwhelmingly the No 1 choice, with a third of voters (33 percent) saying they would vote for the former vice president - despite her defeat by Trump in November.\n\nWhen asked what he has made of Trump's first few weeks back in the White House, Smith said he agreed with the president on the issue of transgender athletes in women's sports but was 'suspect' about Elon Musk.\n\nHe added: 'Oh, he's been a pain in the a**. There's no doubt about it. I don't like some of the stuff that I've seen.\n\n'Don't get me wrong, I agree with his executive order just today on the whole transgender issue with sports, because I don't believe that people born male transitioning to female should be competing in women's sports. But that doesn't mean that I want transgenders or anybody from an LGBTQ+ community to be ostracized in any way.\n\n'I am suspect about Elon Musk. He's not an elected official. He hasn't been confirmed. So to give him this kind of power, where he's got access to the Treasury, when you're looking at checks and got access to people's financial portfolios, I got a problem with that. \n\nSmith is confident he could beat Democrat duo Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in a contest\n\n'However, we have had some crooks in our country for quite some time who have been robbing the American people of their money. And if this dude is going to expose them, I'm down for that. \n\n'You see the difference? That's a perfect example of what I'm talking about. I'm not comfortable with him being that guy, but I am comfortable with what Donald Trump is trying to do when it comes to exposing the crooks that have taken taxpayer money. \n\n'So again, there's a medium. It's not far left, far right, it's neither. It's somewhere in the middle. And I pride myself on being the centrist and getting as close to the center as possible, because everything in life when you're talking about peace, there's never peace when one side or the other gets everything they want.\n\n'There's peace when there's compromise and everybody agrees to compromise. That's the kind of person that I would be, whether I'm an elected official or not.'\n\nSteve SmithSuper BowlDonald TrumpTim Walz\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nStephen A.

Our trusted guides are the social justice Democrats promising to thwart President Donald Trump. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez might not bring a canteen of water, but she will certainly have a bottle of Merlot and a selfie stick, maybe even a circle light in case it gets dark. DEMOCRATIC LEADERS STRUGGLE TO DEFINE THE PARTY, WAY FORWARD: ‘NO COHERENT MESSAGE’ Rep. Ilhan Omar and her wildly progressive ilk will bring along Palestinian headscarves and leftist reading material for the campfire, while senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren will have their own fancy box lunches and blame Republicans for us not having one, too. Then, all of a sudden, across a small creek we spy a cozy fire, and there are Democrats Sen. John Fetterman, of Pennsylvania; Rep. Ritchie Torres, of New York, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro roasting wieners and making s'mores, tents neatly in a row. They motion us over. But somehow, inexplicably, we stick with the lunatics. This is essentially where the Democratic Party, the nation’s oldest, finds itself today, led, to the extent it is led at all, by the most out-of-touch members of their caucus. On CNN this week, Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, who has a bizarre need to remind everyone she is a Black woman every 35 seconds, told Americans, in response to Trump’s popular anti-Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion measures that she is \"tired of the white tears.\" Continuing her performative race baiting, she went on to add, \"...the only people that are crying are the mediocre white boys that have been beaten out by people that historically have had to work so much harder.\" Not to be outdone, last week Democrat bigwigs met to choose a new chairman for the party, and at one point, the Washington Post’s Jonathan Capehart – strangely part of the process -- asked the candidates to raise their hand if they \"believe that racism and misogyny played a role in Kamala Harris’ defeat?\" Every hand went up, including in the audience, to which Capehart oremarked, \"you passed.\" Apparently, these people are still firmly convinced that Harris ran a flawless campaign and was only stymied by the unseen, nefarious forces of bigotry. They have actually somehow persuaded themselves that the most diverse GOP coalition in our lifetimes elected Trump because they are all horrible racists. It's absurd. Fetterman, D-Penn., one of the few Democrats who seems to understand the actual mood of the country, is being chastised by progressives and their media allies for failing to dutifully freak out at the supposed horrors of the Trump administration. Here is a list that MSNBC put out of the hoodie-wearing legislator's transgressions: All of these things are not only perfectly normal, but this is exactly the way that most voters, Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike, want our leaders to behave. Put another way, Fetterman is definitely showing up at the campsite with waterproof matches and a lantern. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Much like Fetterman, Torres and Shapiro and even New York City Mayor Eric Adams have come to realize that most Americans want compromises and sound policies from the Democrats, not a constant struggle session about the evils of Trump. If the dimwitted Democrats double down on their increasingly unpopular addiction to identity politics, they are going to be in the political wilderness for a very long time. Even if they hand the political expedition over to the moderates right now, they are looking at an arduous hike back to civilization. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The good news for Republicans is that the crazy, far-left wing of the Democratic Party is in no mood to hand over control. They will pound away at their drum circle, divvying up the last of trail mix, even if Fetterman and his allies offer them a crackling roasted boar with an apple in its mouth. If the Democrats do not change, then neither will the results, and honestly, that suits Republicans just fine.
