Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy ALISON BOSHOFF, EDITOR AT LARGE \n Published:00:57 GMT, 29 January 2026 |Updated:01:29 GMT, 29 January 2026 \n\nBrooklyn Beckham's ex-girlfriend Hana Cross has backed out of plans for a tell-all interview about her time with him – and his family – after receiving 'mean messages'.\nHana, 27, was considering at least two offers to talk about what it was like to be a part of 'Brand Beckham'.\nShe and Brooklyn dated for nearly a year between 2018 and 2019 and she sat on the front row at Victoria Beckham fashion shows wearing Lady Beckham's designs.\nShe also went to family events, and was embraced by Gordon Ramsay and his family, who are close to the Beckhams.\nShe and Brooklyn split their time between their own wing of the family's barn in the Cotswolds and the former staff quarters at their home in Holland Park, London.\nPosh praised her on social media, and Hana posted pictures of Brooklyn's sister Harper bringing her Nutella pancakes in bed and called Cruz 'little bro'.\n\nBrooklyn Beckham's ex-girlfriend Hana Cross has backed out of plans for a tell-all interview about her time with him, and his family, after receiving 'mean messages'\n\nThe model dated the chef for nearly a year between 2018 and 2019, sat on the front row at Victoria Beckham fashion shows and mimicked some of Victoria's best looks (pictured 2019)\nBut behind the scenes there were apparently serious issues both in her 'toxic' relationship with Brooklyn and between her and Brooklyn's family, as well as between Brooklyn and his family.\nA source says: 'Brooklyn was the black sheep of the family and that would have been her story. There were problems with him and the family even back then.\n'Hana wanted to tell her story but she had some heavy messages from the Brooklyn side warning her about being indiscreet, so she thought better of it.'\nThe story which she could tell would raise the possibility that the family schism isn't just due to a personal dislike between David and Victoria Beckham and Brooklyn's wife Nicola Peltz, which is what Brooklyn said in his explosive Instagram post.\nInstead it's thought that she would say that the Beckhams had issues with her and with Brooklyn long before Nicola came on the scene.\nWhen they split up, it was said that one source of friction was that Brooklyn had refused to get his girlfriend to sign a non-disclosure agreement or NDA, but that his parents had wanted her to do so.\nShe and Brooklyn appear to have met through the fashion business. At the time he was a budding fashion photographer, having dropped out of a course at the renowned Parsons School of Art in New York.\nShe had been modelling for five years and won a competition run by the cheap and cheerful clothes store New Look. From there, her star rose exponentially, with friendships formed with influential figures including the then-Vogue boss Edward Enninful.\n\nBehind the scenes there were apparently serious issues with her 'toxic' relationship with Brooklyn and his family\n\nDuring her relationship with Brooklyn, Hana supported Victoria at one of her fashion shows (the family are pictured alongside Anna Wintour)\n\nHana had previously copied many of Victoria's outfits during her romance with Brooklyn \n\nA source said: 'Hana wanted to tell her story but she had some heavy messages from the Brooklyn side warning her about being indiscreet, so she thought better of it'\nAn admiring profile in Glamour magazine (pre Brooklyn) noted that she had 'arguably the best brows in Britain'.\nShe says that if she ever has a 'down day' about herself she uses the mantra:' I am loved, I love my job, and tomorrow is another day.'\nShe told the mag that she left her 'naturally wild' eyebrows alone to 'do their own thing' and said she would never consider lip fillers or any other cosmetic tweaks.\nShe and Brooklyn were first spotted together in December 2018 at the British Fashion Awards afterparty. She spent Christmas and New Year hanging out with the Beckhams.\nBrooklyn and Hannah were at Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park with Brooklyn's Cousin Libby Adams in February 2019.\nBut in March they had a bust-up after going to watch the English rock musician Yungblud perform at the Camden Assembly in North London.\nA witness said: 'Brooklyn had sunk a few beers and ended up getting into a row with Hana.\n'It had been a bit of a wild night out and it got a bit messy.\n'Brooklyn got really upset and ended up storming into the street. Hana read him the riot act and told him she didn't like it when he was acting up and drinking too much.'\nOn Valentine's Day in 2019, Brooklyn and Hana took a trip to Paris.\nBrooklyn shared a picture of the couple at the Eiffel Tower with caption: 'Me and my girl. Luckiest man in the world. Love you baby.' Hana followed suit writing : 'Thank you for making me the happiest girl in the world. I love you! Happy Valentine's Day xx' They also went to Victoria's fashion show.\nShe was Instagram pals with the whole Beckham bunch, including Gordon Ramsay's children and actress Liv Tyler, then the wife of David Beckham's best pal and bag carrier Dave Gardner.\nShe went with the Beckham children - and their security - to Coachella.\nIn an interview with Tatler magazine in 2019 Hana Cross said of Victoria Beckham: 'We talk about everything.' She was the only non-family member at Mrs Beckham's birthday that year.\nIn April there was an apparent row outside a restaurant, with Brooklyn's brother Romeo, then 16, putting his hand on her shoulder to try and calm things down.\nThe young couple adopted a Pomeranian puppy, Soho, but after rows at the Cannes film festival in May, finally split in July 2019.\nIt was reported that Victoria and David were delighted and that they had quietly suggested he end the relationship months earlier.\nBrooklyn reportedly had a fling with Rita Ora after they split.\n\nThe young couple adopted a Pomeranian puppy, Soho, but after rows at the Cannes film festival in May, finally split in July 2019 (pictured at the festival)\n\nWhile Hana tried to put on a friendly front with the Beckham clan, it was alleged in 2019 the family were thrilled when she and Brooklyn split\n\nIt raises the possibility that the family schism isn't just due to a personal dislike between the Beckhams and Brooklyn's wife Nicola Peltz (pictured), after the chef's bombshell statement\nMs Cross later released a single which appeared to refer to the relationship. She sang: 'I wish that someone told me you had a habit for dishonesty - though you break my heart, I want to stay.'\nAfter the split she dated Jude Law's son Rafferty and Jack Whitehall. In 2023 she wrote on Instagram: 'Sometimes you have to take a step back before you can move forward. I've been suffering with bad anxiety over the past few years and this is truly a place that has helped me mentally reset and grow.'\nBorn Hana Mahmood in Leeds, her mother, Sarah, nee Clamp, is the daughter of a retired salesman. She was working as a shop manager when she married Khalid Mahmood in November 1994.\nOn the wedding certificate, Khalid, then 37 and divorced, gives his occupation as 'shop proprietor'.\nAt the time of the wedding, he and Sarah were living together in Leeds in a modest three-bedroomed house which is currently said to be worth a modest £91,000.\nThey then moved to Huddersfield and as a young girl, daughter Hana attended the private Mount School in Huddersfield.\nLater the family - including older brother Haris - moved to Chipping Campden in Glos, where she went to the local state school from 2012 to 2016.\nShe left after GCSEs, it seems, to pursue her dreams of modelling stardom.\nBy the time she turned 21, Hana was a big enough noise to throw a birthday party for herself and her pals in a private room at Soho House.\nGordon RamsayHana CrossVictoria Beckham\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBrooklyn's ex Hana Cross was 'pressured' into backing out of exposé on her year with the Beckhams amid family rift\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy HANNAH MCDONALD, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:58 GMT, 29 January 2026 |Updated:01:16 GMT, 29 January 2026 \n\nCoronation Street star Helen Flanagan has criticised the soap for 'sexualising' her and making her 'parade around in knickers like a mad nymphomaniac' aged just 16. \nThe actress, 35, who is best known for playing Rosie Webster on the cobbles, made her first appearance in 2000. \nShe starred on the soap until 2012, then reprised her role in 2017 when she returned for a year. \nWhen Helen was 16, her then-15-year-old character Rosie was groomed by teacher John Stape (Graeme Hawley), before being kidnapped and held hostage by him after their relationship was exposed and he was sacked. He was later revealed to be a serial killer.\nNow, Helen has opened up about being made to film 'sexualised' scenes with a 'much older man' while she was so young. \n'Was it morally right that I was expected to parade about in my knickers like some mad nymphomaniac when I was still just a teenager?' she told The Mirror. \n\nCorrie star Helen Flanagan has criticised the soap for making her 'parade around in knickers like a mad nymphomaniac' and 'kiss a much older man' aged just 16 years old (Seen in 2024)\n\nWhen Helen was 16, her then-15-year-old character Rosie was groomed by teacher John Stape (Graeme Hawley), before being kidnapped and held hostage by him (Pictured on the soap)\n'Alison King, who plays Carla Connor, once kicked off in the green room, saying how disgusting it was that they were sexualising me when I was a young girl. \n'I didn't fully comprehend what she was talking about at the time - I do now, I get it. I had to do kissing and bedroom scenes with a man a lot older than me.'\nThe Daily Mail has contacted ITV for comment. \nDespite her recent claims, Helen has said that she is ready to make a Coronation Street return, seven years on from her soap exit. \nHelen, still who lives nearby the Salford, Manchester-based set, told of how the job would be convenient as she co-parents her three children with her ex Scott Sinclair. \nIn an interview she revealed: 'I'd love to go back to Coronation Street, but they just haven’t asked me and I live around the corner, but they just haven’t asked me.\n'I'd love to, if they asked me. I'd come back, but they obviously haven't,' she told The Sun.\nEarlier this year, Helen teased an epic return to the ITV soap and has even hinted at her first storyline. \n\nNow, Helen has opened up about being made to film 'sexualised' scenes with a 'much older man' while she was so young (pictured in 2008 aged 18)\n\nThe former Coronation Street actress, 35, who is best known for playing Rosie Webster on the cobbles, made her first appearance in 2000 (Seen in 2003)\n\nHelen said: 'Alison King, who plays Carla Connor (Pictured right), once kicked off in the green room, saying how disgusting it was that they were sexualising me when I was a young girl'\nCorrie fans are desperate to know if the actress would ever return, and she told The Mirror: 'I would love to go back to back to Coronation Street.' \nShe explained that being based in Bolton would mean that she would be able to work around her kids - Matilda, nine, Delilah Six, and Charlie, three. \nThe actress has even thought up a storyline that Rosie could take part in if she did make a comeback. \n\n Helen Flanagan says she is ready to make a Coronation Street return seven years on from soap exit \nHelen said: 'A single mum with a real storyline, with two kids that she dumps with Sally to have her Rovers return play out an iconic barmaid role.' \nHelen's comments come after she lifted the lid on her 'throuple' with David Haye.\nShe grabbed headlines after lifting the lid on her 'throuple' with the former heavyweight boxer, 45, in her upcoming book.\nHelen and David enjoyed a brief romance after she split from her ex-fiancé Scott Sinclair, 36, with whom she shares three children - Matilda, 10, Delilah, seven, and Charlie, four. \nThe pair first met when they both appeared on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2012, but did not reconnect for a decade.\n\nThey crossed paths again when Helen bumped into David at an awards ceremony in autumn 2022, before he later reached out after seeing a lingerie shoot she had done for Ann Summers. \nHelen's revelations about her throuple with David come after she recently hit out at footballer Scott for failing to attend their son's nativity, despite the fact that she spent Christmas apart from her three children. \nRecent reports also revealed Helen reportedly told David to dump his girlfriend, Sian Osborne, for her during their toxic relationship.\nA source told The Sun on Sunday: 'Helen wanted David to leave Sian for her. She was mad about David and desperately wanted him to herself.\n'But David cares deeply for Sian, and he was simply never going to leave her for Helen. That was out of the question.'\nDaily Mail contacted Helen and David's representatives for comment at the time. \nITVHelen FlanaganCoronation Street\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nCoronation Street star Helen Flanagan criticises soap for 'sexualising' her and making her 'parade around in knickers like a mad nymphomaniac' aged just 16\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 14\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy JOHN SIDDLE \n Published:00:50 GMT, 29 January 2026 |Updated:01:13 GMT, 29 January 2026 \n\nA lottery winner battered his girlfriend on their first holiday abroad to celebrate his £3.6million jackpot - then posed poolside with a bottle of fizz just hours after being convicted.\nSean Henderson attacked Suzanne Childs in a drunken rage at a luxury Tenerife hotel booked to celebrate his life-changing win last month.\nThe carpenter, from Ilfracombe, Devon, grabbed Ms Childs, 42, by the arm, hurled her against a wall and forced her to the ground during the attack at the five-star GF Gran Costa Adeje resort.\nA Spanish court heard Ms Childs was left with painful bruising to her arm and knee, as well as injuries to her head and face in the attack last Thursday.\nOn Monday, Henderson was handed a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to pay compensation.\nIncredibly, after being spared jail on his birthday, the woman-beater shared a Facebook post clutching a bottle of sparking wine poolside, captioned: 'Happy 40th to me!!'.\nThe brazen post was cryptically set to a cover of The Rolling Stones track 'I'm Free'.\nMs Childs, a designer who has three daughters from a previous relationship, said the assault had left her fearing for her life.\n\nSean Henderson attacked Suzanne Childs in a drunken rage at a luxury Tenerife hotel booked to celebrate his life-changing win last month\n\nThe carpenter, from Ilfracombe, Devon, grabbed Ms Childs, 42, by the arm, hurled her against a wall and forced her to the ground during the attack at the five-star GF Gran Costa Adeje resort\n\nA Spanish court heard Ms Childs was left with painful bruising to her arm and knee, as well as injuries to her head and face in the attack last Thursday\n 'I honestly thought he was going to kill me,' she said.\n'When he first got off the sofa I could see how angry he was and I knew I needed to run straight away.\n'He caught me, grabbed my arm and threw me head-first into the wall.\n'I was absolutely petrified. The force of my head hitting the wall made me fear I'd fractured my skull or suffered brain damage.\n'There was blood and broken glass everywhere, I practically crawled out of the room.'\nThe couple had travelled abroad together for the first time to celebrate Henderson's National Lottery Set For Life win, which he landed on December 23.\nThe jackpot means the remorseless thug will receive £10,000 a month for the next 30 years.\nMs Childs said: 'When he won, I thought, \"this is amazing - what a great life we're going to have together\".\n'But it was like a switch flipped and the real Sean came out.\n'His behaviour changed, his attitude towards me changed. It felt like the money fed his ego and he didn't need me anymore.\n\nOn Monday, Henderson was handed a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to pay compensation\n\nAfter being spared jail on his birthday, Henderson shared a Facebook post clutching a bottle of sparking wine poolside, captioned: 'Happy 40th to me!!'\n'He was verbally horrible the first night. Then two days later it turned physical.\n'We'd been drinking and he was very drunk. He was saying horrible things for ages - like I was a scrounger who was only with him for the money.\n'I got out of bed and went over to try and calm things down. Some water from my glass splashed on him and he just exploded.\n'I saw how angry he was and started running away, but he chased me, grabbed my arm and threw me head-first into the wall.\n'There were no apologies, no sorries. He just said, \"I didn't mean to do that.\" He doesn't give a s***.\n'I could have fractured my skull.'\nHenderson appeared at the Violence Against Women Section of the Court of First Instance of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. \nCourt documents state that on January 22 at around 9.30pm in Room 286 of the hotel, Henderson seized Ms Childs by the arm, threw her against the wall and to the ground, striking her head, knee and upper lip.\nShe was left with a painful bruise on the inside of her right arm, a bruise over her left kneecap and facial injuries. She also suffered a cut to her thumb.\nMs Childs managed to flee the room and reach the lift, where another couple came to her aid.\nHotel staff called police and an ambulance, and Henderson was arrested.\nHe spent 48 hours in custody before appearing in court, where he confessed to 'gender-based assault' - the equivalent of domestic violence in the UK.\n\nThe jackpot means the remorseless thug will receive £10,000 a month for the next 30 years\nProsecutors had demanded an immediate nine-month jail term, but Henderson was given suspended sentence - common in Spain where prison sentences of two years or less are normally deferred for first-time offenders.\nAuthorities also imposed a restraining order preventing him from returning to the hotel, coming within 500m of Ms Childs or travelling on the same flight home.\nShe returned to Britain alone on January 27.\nMs Childs, also from Ilfracombe, has since reported the assault to Devon and Cornwall Police.\nVideo recorded shortly before the assault shows Henderson unleashing a foul-mouthed tirade at Ms Childs, calling her a 'vile c***', branding her a 'scrounger' and telling her 'I've paid for every f***ing thing'.\nHe also drunkenly sneered: 'You can't win the money and not be a c***,' and told her: 'Go and find someone else who you think is amazing.'\nMs Childs revealed there had been warning signs earlier in the relationship, including shouting and hurtful comments, but this was the first time he had been physically violent towards her.\nShe said: 'Winning the money just seemed to set him off. It boosted his ego into the stratosphere.'\nHenderson had recently spoken publicly about his lottery win, telling how he only bought the winning ticket after being unable to park at Lidl and popping into a Co-op instead.\nThe father said at the time that the prize had 'changed my life forever', adding that he planned to celebrate with the five-star Canary Islands holiday, buy a house, treat his son to a PlayStation 5 and enjoy meals out with family.\nHe also said he intended to keep working as a carpenter, but with more flexibility.\nMs Childs said she had no hesitation in ending the relationship.\nShe added: 'There's not enough money in the world to stay with someone who's abusive. I'd rather be with someone dirt poor and kind than rich and violent.\n'Sean's ego was already there. Then the cash arrived and it sent his narcissism into overdrive.\n'I just want people to know what a nasty person he is.\n'Hopefully it will stop this happening to another woman who might be drawn in by his wealth.'\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLottery winner battered his girlfriend in a drunken rage on Tenerife holiday to celebrate him scooping £3.6million jackpot\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy ASHLEIGH GRAY \n Published:00:24 GMT, 29 January 2026 |Updated:01:10 GMT, 29 January 2026 \n\nPaul Dano has finally reacted to the swipe Quentin Tarantino made about his acting abilities.\nIn December 2025 the 62-year-old director appeared on an episode of The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast and described Dano, 41, as a 'flaw' in 2007's Oscar-winning movie There Will Be Blood.\nHe went on to say that the actor is 'just such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy.'\nAnd when host Ellis reasoned that Daniel Day-Lewis' performance may have simply 'overshadowed' Dano's, Tarantino doubled down: 'So you put him with the weakest male actor in SAG? The limpest dick in the world?'\nAt the Sundance Film Festival on Wednesday, Dano shared how he felt about various famous actors coming to his defense in the wake of the unflattering comments.\n'I was incredibly grateful that the world spoke up for me so I didn't have to,' he said, per Variety.\n\nPaul Dano has finally reacted to the swipe Quentin Tarantino made about his acting abilities; pictured on January 13\n\nIn December 2025 the 62-year-old director appeared on an episode of The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast and described Dano, 41, as a 'flaw' in 2007's Oscar-winning movie There Will Be Blood\nDano's Little Miss Sunshine co-star Toni Collette was by his side on Wednesday as she also gave her unfiltered reaction to Tarantino's unsavory remarks. \n'F**k that guy!' the 53-year-old actress said. 'He must've been high. It was just confusing. Who does that?'\n\n George Clooney blasts Quentin Tarantino's 'cruel' insults of 'weak' Paul Dano, Matthew Lillard and Owen Wilson \nOf Collette coming to his defense, Dano said, 'That was really nice.'\nMeanwhile, Jonathan Dayton labeled Tarantino's takedown – which extended to actors Matthew Lillard and Owen Wilson – an 'embarrassment.'\nHe mused: 'I can only think that his rawness of his performance made Tarantino uncomfortable.'\nAnd Little Miss Sunshine co-director Valerie Faris said, 'You know, what was interesting was the people coming out to defend Paul. There was immediately… he is loved by so many. He is so smart.'\nDano has earned a spot among the most distinguished stars in entertainment, appearing in The Fabelmans, The Batman, Prisoners, and Love & Mercy among others. \nHis accolades include a BAFTA Best Supporting Actor nod for There Will Be Blood, a Golden Globe nomination and two Emmy nominations.\n\nTarantino said the actor, pictured with Daniel Day Lewis in 2007, is 'just such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy' \n\nDano's Little Miss Sunshine co-star Toni Collette was by his side at Sundance Film Festival on Wednesday as she also gave her unfiltered reaction to Tarantino's unsavory remarks, saying, 'F**k that guy!'; pictured in December\n\nDay-Lewis came to the defense of his There Will Be Blood co-star Dano following Tarantino's criticism.\nAfter a fan-run Daniel Day-Lewis Instagram account posted, 'Paul Dano is one of the best and most talented actors of his generation,' a rep for the retired star told The Guardian he 'endorsed the sentiment.'\nThe Batman director Matt Reeves joined the conversation, declaring on X in December: 'Paul Dano is an incredible actor, and an incredible person.'\nAnd Escape at Dannemora director Ben Stiller used the app to add: 'idk man i think paul dano is an incredible actor.'\nTarantino added during the controversial podcast appearance: 'I'm not saying he's giving a terrible performance. I'm saying he's giving a non-entity [performance]. \n'I don't care for him. I don't care for Owen Wilson, I don't care for Matthew Lillard.'\nSundance Film FestivalQuentin Tarantino\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nPaul Dano FINALLY addresses Quentin Tarantino's 'weakest actor' jibe amid mass Hollywood backlash\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 19\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Josh Shapiro said that in his view, Vice President JD Vance has “offered comfort” to people on the right who espouse anti-Jewish views, as the Republican Party navigates an ongoing intra-coalition feud over antisemitism. Vance faced criticism for not mentioning Jews in a post on X commemorating Holocaust Remembrance Day. “Today we remember the millions of lives lost during the Holocaust, the millions of stories of individual bravery and heroism, and one of the enduring lessons of one of the darkest chapters in human history: that while humans create beautiful things and are full of compassion, we’re also capable of unspeakable brutality,” Vance wrote. The post included photos of him standing beneath Hebrew words translating to “Never Forget” during a visit last year to the Dachau concentration camp in Germany, where he was given a tour by a 97-year-old Holocaust survivor. “And we promise never again to go down the darkest path.” Shapiro, a 2028 Democratic presidential contender, said in an interview Tuesday that he had not yet seen Vance’s post. But he also said he did not think it was surprising that Vance’s post did not explicitly include Jews given his handling of the issue of right-wing antisemitism. “Remember that the reason why we memorialize the Holocaust on this day, really, essentially, is to never forget,” said Shapiro, a practicing Jew who has centered his faith in his public life. “And the reason you want to never forget is so that we never live through that atrocity again. Part of never forgetting is making sure that the facts of what happened are recited, are remembered. The fact that JD Vance couldn’t bring himself to acknowledging that 6 million Jews were killed by Hitler and by the Nazis speaks volumes. “It is not a surprise to me, however, given the way in which he has openly supported the AfD party, given the way he openly embraces neo-Nazis and neo-Nazi political parties, given the way in which he has offered comfort, really, to the antisemites on the right who are infecting the Republican Party,” Shapiro continued. “So it’s not a shock to me that he would omit that, but it’s a sad day that the vice president of the United States on Holocaust Awareness Day couldn’t address that.” Shapiro is on a book tour for his newly released memoir, “Where We Keep the Light: Stories from a Life of Service,” published this week. It is the latest example of his taking sharp aim at Vance, like a number of other potential Democratic presidential contenders who could face Vance in the 2028 election. Shapiro has described Vance as a “sycophant” who “does whatever he thinks his boss wants him to do.” Critics on the left and the right took aim at Vance’s comments for not specifically mentioning the Jewish lives lost. Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered about 6 million Jews across Europe during the Holocaust, roughly two-thirds of Europe’s Jewish population, in addition to hundreds of thousands of Roma, disabled people and political dissidents. Tablet Magazine, a conservative-leaning publication focused on Jewish issues, said on X that Vance offered a “unique commemoration of the Holocaust that manages to avoid mentioning Jews or condemning Nazis.” Halie Soifer, CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, wrote that it “takes effort” on Vance’s part “to issue a Holocaust Remembrance Day statement like this without any mention of six million Jews lost, the Jewish people, Nazis, or the issue of antisemitism.” And Laura Loomer, a close ally of President Donald Trump whom Vance criticized last week, when he accused her of stoking division on the right, said on X: “6 million Jewish lives.” Vance allies, including Sam Markstein, national political director for the Republican Jewish Coalition, came to his defense, saying critics were reading too much into his post. Others pointed to Shapiro’s own X post recognizing Holocaust remembrance, which made note of rising antisemitism but did not explicitly mention Jewish lives lost, a leading criticism of Vance’s post. “This is an insane standard and a BS attack,” wrote Alex Brusewitz, a former Trump campaign official. “The Vice President literally posted a photo of himself [and] the Second Lady at Dachau. He has been an incredible friend to both the Jewish community and Israel.” In the early days of his first term in the White House, Trump was also criticized for having issued a Holocaust Remembrance Day statement that did not explicitly mention Jews. Trump’s White House statements every year he has been in office since then have done so, including Tuesday’s. The issue of antisemitism has roiled the right in recent months, with Vance facing pressure to take a strong stand. Some leaders, including Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, have warned of a rise in antisemitism within the Republican Party’s coalition, singling out younger conservatives and right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson, a close Vance ally, for having hosted a Holocaust denier on his podcast. Vance says there is not such a buildup. “Do I think that the Republican Party is substantially more antisemitic than it was 10 or 15 years ago? Absolutely not,” he told NBC News last year. “In any bunch of apples, you have bad people. But my attitude on this is we should be firm in saying antisemitism and racism is wrong. ... I think it’s kind of slanderous to say that the Republican Party, the conservative movement, is extremely antisemitic.” In an interview with UnHerd, Vance said Nick Fuentes, a right-wing activist known for espousing antisemitic views, “can eat s---,” adding, “Antisemitism, and all forms of ethnic hatred, have no place in the conservative movement.” In the same interview, he said Fuentes’ influence is “overstated by people who want to avoid having a foreign-policy conversation about America’s relationship with Israel.” Vance’s office declined to comment for this article. For Shapiro, observance of his Jewish faith is a through line in his memoir, and he writes about its playing a significant role in his upbringing and throughout his political career. “Throughout my life, it has always been central to who I am,” Shapiro said in the interview, adding: “I’m as proud of my faith and who I am as I was when I was a little boy. I know that things have changed around me. I know that antisemitism is on the rise, but it certainly has not changed how I go about being the person that I am every day, how Lori and I raise our four children and our commitment to our faith.” Shapiro, who recently announced his re-election campaign, has focused on combating political violence in recent months, after the assassination attempt on Trump in his state in 2024 and, last year, the firebombing of his official residence hours after his family gathered for a Passover seder. Cody Balmer, who pleaded guilty to committing the attack, dialed 911 soon after the fire and said he was angered by Shapiro’s stance on Israel and Gaza. Shapiro wrote extensively about that episode in his memoir, detailing a call he got from Trump. Shapiro wrote that during the call, Trump “cautioned that I shouldn’t want to be president, given how dangerous it had become to hold the office now.” At an event at the 92nd Street Y in New York City on Tuesday and in his interview with NBC News afterward, Shapiro addressed whether the country was ready for a Jewish president. “I don’t believe, as some have suggested, that a woman can’t be president, a gay person can’t be president, a Jewish person can’t be president,” he said. “I think what the American people want is just someone who’s going to be on their side and fight for them and deliver for them, regardless of what their particular characteristic is. I think the American people are good and they’re decent, and they just want elected leaders who are going to fight for them every day, regardless of what they look like or who they love or who they pray to.” At the earlier event, Shapiro discussed the need for leaders in politics, the media, business and beyond to stand firm against antisemitism. As governor, he has expanded Holocaust education in Pennsylvania. “And let me be very, very clear,” he said. “There is antisemitism and hate on the political left and on the political right.” Shapiro also addressed the part of his memoir in which he revealed that during the vice presidential vetting process in 2024, an attorney working for Kamala Harris’ campaign asked whether he had ever been an agent of Israel. He wrote that he told the attorney the question was “offensive.” CNN later reported that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whom Harris selected as her running mate, was asked whether he had ever been an agent of China, a question prompted by his visits to the country. Shapiro has made multiple visits to Israel throughout his life. Asked whether he believed the question was standard based on past travel to foreign countries, Shapiro said: “I don’t know why they asked the question. “But I respect their right to ask that question,” he continued. “I agreed to be a part of that process. They asked the question, and I was expressing in this book not an opinion on what I think of them, but simply how it made me feel.” Shapiro also said he believes Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection “need to be reformed and they need to be reconstituted” after federal officers killed Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minnesota this month. But he said the problems in Minnesota come from the very top. “The issue with Minnesota is this mission is compromised, and the mission needs to be terminated because they’ve received a direction from the president of the United States that is outside the bounds of the law,” Shapiro said. “It is unconstitutional. It is violating people’s rights. That’s the problem here. It’s the direction that’s coming from the top.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/josh-shapiro-accuses-jd-vance-giving-comfort-right-wing-antisemitism-rcna256261","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260127-Josh-Shapiro-aa-1013-688277.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 01:08:48","author":"Allan Smith","authors":["Allan Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.046},{"id":397160232,"title":"We bought our dream clifftop home for £165,000 a decade ago, now it's been left to fall into the sea by a council who couldn't care less","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nThe Crime Desk\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Jan 29th 2026\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlex Pretti spits at ICE agents and smashes federal SUV's tail light in shocking footage taken 11 days before he was shot dead\n\nTragic Noah Donohoe, 14, fell off his bike and was seen undressing in the street on the day he went missing, witnesses say - but he didn't seem to have a head injury that would explain how he ended dying naked in a storm drain\n\nIran tells Trump 'our fingers are on the trigger': Tehran warns it will 'respond like never before' if US carries out military strikes after president warned of 'major destruction'\n\nStacey Solomon's 'ruthless' behaviour with Essex's mumfluencers exposed: From the Style Sisters to Mrs Hinch and now Money Mum, insiders tell 'there's only so much money to go around', her 'uncanny' habit... and reveal 'frenemy' drama\n\nA renovation left me £20,000 in debt.

Email caitlin.leng@dailymail.co.uk\nBy CAITLIN LENG \n Published:00:54 GMT, 29 January 2026 |Updated:01:04 GMT, 29 January 2026 \n\nAn elderly couple forced to evacuate their clifftop home with only days' notice have told of their heartbreak after it was left to crumble into the sea by a council that didn't 'really seem to care.'\nGlenda and Michael Dennington, both in their 80s, were ordered to leave their home in Hembsy, Norfolk, on January 6 by the local council, because it was at risk of collapse due to rapid coastal erosion.\nEarlier this week, the retired husband and wife wrote to the Daily Mail about how let down they feel by authorities and insurers who they claim have failed to help residents losing their homes on Britain's fastest-eroding coastline.\nIn a heartbreaking letter, they said: 'We were given one day's notice to get out, then a further two days to clear the property. Volunteers helped us or we would have lost everything.\n'The local council have given very little assistance to people losing their homes. The insurance company doesn't want to know.\n'We feel like second-class citizens, yet have always worked and paid our taxes. Now we and our neighbours have been thrown on the scrapheap.'\nThe retired husband and wife were told they needed to evacuate just one day after Michael, 82, was discharged from hospital following a hip replacement, and as Storm Goretti struck.\nMrs Dennington was left in tears as they packed up their belongings and left the property, which she described as their 'final resting home'. The bungalow now stands empty and is due to be demolished this week. \nThe couple bought their home for £165,000 in August 2012 after visiting and being endeared by the 'friendly' community, with no concerns or warnings about erosion when they first bought the property.\n\nMichael (left), Glenda (right) and their dog Rusty were forced to leave their home with only a couple of days' notice as it was at risk of collapse due to rapid erosion\n\nThe couple said the experience had been 'devastating' and accused authorities of failing to help those losing their homes in this way\n\nThe couple lived at the property (pictured) in Hemsby, Norfolk since 2012 and were not told of any risks concerning erosion during its survey\nMrs Dennington, 80, said: 'We moved to Norfolk 14 years ago after retiring because we love it here. We had a full survey on it before we moved in, no one mentioned erosion.\n'We had never heard of any erosion until 2013, when other houses were lost to sea after the storm surge that December.\n'2018 was really sad. We watched houses disappear into the sea. That is when the local council began having meetings about the erosion problem – Michael and I went to every meeting.'\nIt was then, Mrs Dennington said, erosion became a concern for Great Yarmouth Borough Council, who regularly held meetings with residents to discuss planning and funding to manage the coastline's disappearance at an accelerating rate. \nA total of 36 properties have been lost to the sea or demolished because of erosion since 2013, and 14 homes were were at risk of collapsing into the sea in Hemsby earlier this year because of Storm Goretti. \nThis was not something, however, that Mrs Dennington believed would ever affect her and her husband, with both of them believing they had found their 'forever home'.\n\n Footage shows dramatic effect over 30 years at village with 'Britain's most eroded coastline' \nShe said: 'When we moved there, we could barely see the sea. It was in the distance. And as I say, erosion was never mentioned in the survey.\n'We never dreamed this would happen. The property was utopia, really. We have had many happy memories here.\n'Just after we moved there my sister was diagnosed with cancer. She spent many happy hours looking out in the garden.\n'When she was feeling down, she used to come here. She unfortunately passed away in 2016.'\nThe heartbreak of saying goodbye to their home was made even harder by seeing the demolition process unfold online.\n'I saw on Facebook our home being taken apart, quarter by quarter,' Mrs Dennington said.\n'The front has been removed, and the bathroom and the utility room. At the back of the house, the conservatory has been removed. It is as if it's being cut quarter by quarter.\n'It's heartbreaking to see this happening on social media. I still can't get my head around it – neither of us can. We are devastated.'\n\nGlenda (left) and Michael (right) recalled the happy memories they shared with family in the property over the years\n\nThe property (pictured) sat on the Norfolk coast, an area increasingly impacted by erosion across the last decade\nMrs Dennington described how she and her husband were 'more of less told to get out' of the home they'd shared for over a decade by Great Yarmouth Borough Council.\nShe said: 'On January 6 we had a knock at the door from the council. They gave us notice that we needed to get out of the property by Thursday night because of the storm.\n'I told them Michael was not up to such a move after his operation – he was on morphine for pain. So, we were able to extend the evacuation to the Sunday.\n'I was told to \"just go and have a cup of tea,\" think about the situation and then sort out the forms.\n'It was unbelievable. It felt like they wanted me to sell my home away – they barely gave notice, and they more or less told us that we we've got to get out.\n'We didn't sleep that night. On Saturday, we just couldn't believe it was our last night in that bed. It was heartbreaking and still doesn't feel real.'\nThe couple, who live with their youngest son Gary and pet dog Rusty, left their home on January 8 and stayed in temporary accommodation at a nearby holiday chalet before moving into their current rental property.\nThroughout the moving process, Mrs Dennington said, the council offered minimal to zero support.\nShe said: 'Our youngest son, who lives with us, has health problems. He suffers with a heart problem and he's also got a back problem, and when we were trying to pack our stuff, he did a lot of lifting and it ended up that he couldn't do much at all.\n'He looked after his dad while I was out 10 or 11 hours a day, trying to sort out clearing the home. Nobody came from the council to help. They did nothing to help us move – nothing at all.\n\nIn this aerial view properties stand next to rapidly eroding cliffs, on January 19, 2026 in Hemsby, England\n\nRusty pictured with Glenda and Michael's son, Gary, in their former home\n'Michael was not up to moving, he was still on morphine. It was just an absolute nightmare.'\n'The council initially suggested a B&B for us to go to because they could accommodate us and our dog, Rusty, or if not, we should foster Rusty out or give him to family to look after.\n'But there was no way we were going to leave the dog somewhere unfamiliar, and because of Michael's operation a B&B simply was not viable.\n'We also were not eligible for a council property because of our savings. We ended up rushing the lease for our current place, which our elder son found, in a day. If not, we would have had nowhere to go.'\nHowever, the lease on their new rental is only for six months - leaving both worried and in a tricky financial situation. Mrs Dennington said the couple have spent a large portion of their savings on rent.\nAnd, as revealed in yesterday's letter to the Daily Mail, their insurance company has told them that they will not cover coastal erosion, leaving them with no financial safety net.\nShe continued: 'We had saved for retirement, but at the end of the day with the extra costs of this move and now because we have to pay private rent; we're probably going to have to go on benefits.\n'Our savings are going to disappear. We've paid for six-months rent on this new property and I think we've spent about £10,000 pound and there's nothing to show for it.\n'Financially, I don't think we we're going to be able to buy another place. Until things have settled down, we just don't know where we are financially.'\n'I want to see a future for us. At the minute, I don't see a future for us because I keep thinking, we've moved ourselves into here with a few belongings, but in the end, we've got to start again in another five and a half months.\n'We've got to go through it all again, and we've got to sort out where we're going to.'\nThe coastline of Hembsy has changed significantly in five decades, once being protected by rolling sand dunes with rows of homes set safely behind them.\nNow those dunes have disappeared, and dozens of properties have been lost to the sea. In the past month alone, 14 homes have been demolished, with rubble removed by the local lifeboat station.\nHemsby is not alone. Homes are also being demolished at Thorpeness in Suffolk, where several more remain at risk.\nExperts have warned that undefended coastal villages like Hemsby may have no long-term future, with this stretch of the Norfolk coast described as among the fastest-eroding in northern Europe.\nA spokesperson for Great Yarmouth Borough Council said: 'Following the loss of more than 10m of cliff in Hemsby at the start of January, and with Storm Goretti fast approaching, a number of properties were assessed by experts as being at imminent risk of dangerously collapsing. \n'The council's priority is the safety of its residents and the family was visited on January 6 and advised to leave the property before the storm hit because the property was extremely close to the cliff edge. \n'The options available were fully explained and advice and support around housing was offered. Temporary accommodation was made available, but in this case was refused and the family made its own arrangements. \n'It is extremely traumatic for anyone who faces the prospect of having to leave their home because of coastal erosion and the council is working to support those affected at what is an incredibly difficult time for them.' \nStorm Goretti\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nWe bought our dream clifftop home for £165,000 a decade ago, now it's been left to fall into the sea by a council who couldn't care less\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Yang, who ran in the 2020 Democratic primary, made the claim in excerpts from his upcoming book, \"Hey Yang, Where’s My Thousand Bucks?\", which were provided to the U.K.-based outlet, The Times, on Wednesday. According to Yang, Harris' team blocked him from engaging with the campaign after he urged former President Joe Biden to step out of the race following his debate with then-candidate Donald Trump. ANDREW YANG BLASTS DEM STRATEGY OF BOOSTING 'EXTREME' GOP PRIMARY CANDIDATES: 'AMERICANS SHOULD BE ANGRY' \"Kamala Harris’s campaign had put me on a list of people not to use or refer to, due to the fact that I’d ‘crossed the line’ in my disrespect of Joe Biden,\" Yang wrote. \"So dumb. I was kind of glad, to be honest, because if they’d asked me to do something, I would have felt honor bound to comply, but I don’t know how convincing I would have been.\" Despite this, Yang went on to endorse Harris for president, though he called her campaign's decision to avoid him \"a sign of a culture problem\" within the party. \"If you’re trying your best to win, who cares what I said four weeks ago?\" Yang wrote. \"Use anyone who might move votes.\" JOSH SHAPIRO ACCUSES HARRIS' VETTING TEAM OF MAKING DISRESPECTFUL COMMENTARY TOWARD HIS WIFE Yang pointed out that Harris and other members of the Democratic Party similarly ousted Elon Musk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from their ranks despite their previous support for liberal candidates after they did not follow party orthodoxy. Kennedy, Yang noted, considered endorsing Harris for president before ultimately backing Trump after Harris' team rejected him. Yang also argued that a similar mindset existed in liberal media, claiming that his job as a CNN contributor was rescinded in 2021 after he registered as an independent. KAMALA HARRIS SAYS SHE 'NEEDED MORE SUPPORT' FROM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION DURING HER 2024 CAMPAIGN \"[T]he news came out that I was no longer a Democrat,\" Yang wrote. \"My agent called me during this time and said, ‘Hey, CNN is rescinding its offer to you. Apparently, they don’t want to be seen as supporting a third party.’\" \"I responded, ‘Wouldn’t that make me more valuable to them, not less, in that I’d be an objective voice that isn’t tied up in one party or the other?’\" Fox News Digital reached out to Harris' office and CNN for comment. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP In another excerpt, Yang teased a potential 2028 presidential run, likely under the Forward Party, which he co-founded in 2021. \"[T]he odds of my running again are high,\" Yang wrote.","summary":"Former Democrat-turned-independent Andrew Yang claimed former Vice President Kamala Harris&apos; campaign team blacklisted him ahead of the 2024 presidential race.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/possible-2028-candidate-claims-he-blacklisted-kamala-harris-campaign","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2026/01/kamala-harris-andrew-yang.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 01:00:04","author":"Lindsay Kornick","authors":["Lindsay Kornick"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.41},{"id":397160238,"title":"Ellen DeGeneres' flood-cursed Cotswolds farmhouse is OFF the market with rich American buyer poised to snap it up after she secretly slashed £4.5million off the £22million asking price","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Jan 29th 2026\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlex Pretti spits at ICE agents and smashes federal SUV's tail light in shocking footage taken 11 days before he was shot dead\n\nTragic Noah Donohoe, 14, fell off his bike and was seen undressing in the street on the day he went missing, witnesses say - but he didn't seem to have a head injury that would explain how he ended dying naked in a storm drain\n\nIran tells Trump 'our fingers are on the trigger': Tehran warns it will 'respond like never before' if US carries out military strikes after president warned of 'major destruction'\n\nStacey Solomon's 'ruthless' behaviour with Essex's mumfluencers exposed: From the Style Sisters to Mrs Hinch and now Money Mum, insiders tell 'there's only so much money to go around', her 'uncanny' habit... and reveal 'frenemy' drama\n\nA renovation left me £20,000 in debt.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy RICHARD SIMPSON \n Published:00:56 GMT, 29 January 2026 |Updated:00:56 GMT, 29 January 2026 \n\nUS chat show host Ellen DeGeneres' flood-cursed Cotswolds farmhouse is on the brink of sale after she secretly slashed an astonishing £4.5 million off its asking price, the Daily Mail can reveal.\nWhen Kitesbridge Farm near Burford was put up for sale last July, baffled local estate agents described the asking price - 50 per cent more than what she bought it for a year earlier - as 'absolutely crazy'.\nSince it went on the market it has continued to be plagued by flooding with the River Windrush, a tributary of the Thames which runs through its 43-acre Oxfordshire spread, often breaking its banks.\nMeanwhile Ellen herself - and her wife actress Portia De Rossi - bought a further £15 million home, significantly on a hilltop, near the celebrity enclave of Chipping Norton which is half an hour north due in part to the persistently high flood waters at Kitesbridge Farm.\nThen, various reports before Christmas claimed Ellen and Portia were so fed up with long British winters (this being their second) that they were packing up and moving back to sunny Montecito in California (albeit perhaps temporarily) to catch up with old friends.\nUnhelpfully also, Rachel Reeves' budget at the end of November also compounded the problems selling Kitesbridge Farm, when she announced houses of this price would be subject to a £7,500 annual 'mansion' tax.\n\nEllen DeGeneres' flood-cursed Cotswolds farmhouse is OFF the market with rich American buyer poised to snap it up after she secretly slashed £4.5million off the £22million asking price\n\nSince it went on the market it has continued to be plagued by flooding with the River Windrush often breaking its banks (pictured during a flood in November 2024) \nInterest in the farm is thought to have ground to a halt at the end of last year, at which point, Sotheby's International started, on Ellen's instruction, quietly putting the word out to interested parties that she was slashing its price from £22.5 million to £18 million - a £4.5 million price cut.\nThe Daily Mail have gone to Ellen's representatives for comment. \nA source familiar with the sale explained its complex nature to the Daily Mail: 'There is firm interest at the moment in Kitesbridge which is why it has vanished from the website for the moment. \n'We have an American buyer lined up and are going through the motions. Its disappearance from the website is part of the agreement between the vendor and the buyer. \n'So it appears as 'no longer available' just while try and sort out final terms etc etc. The situation will be clearer in the next few days.'\nThe source continued: 'It has been widely publicised and it's no secret that the current owners (Ellen DeGeneres and Portia De Rossi) bought the property at £15 million. \n'They then spent £7.5million on re-doing it both externally and internally. They then curated with their interior designer all the furniture which is included in the price. \n'So that is where the initial £22.5 million price came from. It was felt that at least there was a need to recover the owner's financial position.\n'Then more recently, the price was reduced to £18 million but that was not publicized. We were just able to mention that to people as and when they called. \n\nA source familiar with the sale explained to the Daily Mail: 'There is firm interest at the moment in Kitesbridge which is why it has vanished from the website for the moment'\n\nExclusive pictures of the property show it was still flooded in November 2025 \n\nThe colossal price rise for an estate which had a well-publicised flooding concern seemed back then to be baffling to local Cotswolds estate agents \n'It was an unusual strategy but sometimes adverse publicity can affect the business of certain clients. There was no pressure on the client to sell (Ellen and Portia are worth £400 million).'\nAnd indeed in recent days, interested parties enquiring about Kitesbridge Farm on estate agents Sotheby's International's website have been met with the prompt: 'This property is no longer available'.\nEllen unusually decided to do a one-women show in Cheltenham in July of last year during which she announced to a surprised audience that the initial Cotswolds farmhouse in Asthall near Burford was now up for sale. \nA day later - on July 11 - it emerged that she had put the property on the market with Sotheby's International estate agents for £22.5 million, which represented a 50 per cent price hike.\nThe colossal price rise for an estate which had a well-publicised flooding concern seemed back then to be baffling to local Cotswolds estate agents.\nOne estate agent, who was familiar with the initial sale to Ellen back in June of 2024 simply said: 'Well, £22.5 million is an absolutely crazy price. \n'I know Ellen has had some interior decorating work done, and there has been a small amount of landscaping too. But she bought the place for £15 million 12 months ago. \n'And even then she paid £2.5m million over the asking price which was just £12.5 million. So £10 million has been added to what it was being marketed at 12 months ago. \n'Good luck to her of course. A house is worth what someone will pay for it.'\nTop end estate agents Sotheby's International Realty started marketing the seven-bedroomed home back in July as a 'A Landmark Country Estate in the Heart of the Cotswolds'\nThe agent described how the farm is 'Discreetly set at the end of a long private driveway, and has been beautifully reimagined over the past year to an exceptional standard. \n'The estate blends period character with sleek, modern design across 43 acres of rolling Cotswold countryside. The main house unfolds around a central landscaped courtyard, a lovely focal point that brings light and flow to the interiors. \n\nThe for-sale price of £22.5million is a 50 per cent increase on the £15million asking price\n\nEllen had interior decorating work done on the home and there was also some landscaping\n\nVarious reports before Christmas claimed Ellen and Portia were so fed up with long British winters that they were packing up and moving back to sunny Montecito in California\n'A series of generous reception rooms overlook this space, creating a seamless link between indoors and out. Designed for both grand-scale entertaining and relaxing, the layout combines sharp architectural detail with a contemporary eye for volume, proportion and finish.'\nThe lavish description continues: 'At the heart of the house is a vast kitchen and breakfast room, anchored by bespoke cabinetry and elegant natural materials. \n'The ground floor also holds the principal suite, a beautiful space with two dressing rooms, a marble-clad ensuite and French doors leading to a private garden. \n'Upstairs are five further bedrooms, alongside a large sitting room offering flexible family accommodation. \n'Beyond the main residence, a charming two-bedroom guest cottage provides private accommodation for extended family, visiting friends or staff, with its own kitchen and sitting room. \n'There is also a converted granary building with a heated five-car garage, a kitchenette, and, upstairs, an impressive party barn with its own pub, ideal for entertaining on a generous scale. \n'Leisure and wellness are superbly catered for: A purpose-built suite features a heated indoor swimming pool, gym, shower facilities and changing room, while a separate helicopter shed offers further potential, with scope for conversion into an indoor padel court, artist's studio, or private office.\n'The gardens and grounds have been thoughtfully landscaped to frame the house and its surrounds. \n'There are formal lawns, a kitchen garden, sculpted paddocks, and a series of outdoor living areas, including a covered dining space within the inner courtyard. \n'The estate enjoys complete privacy yet remains wonderfully connected, just moments from the postcard-pretty village of Asthall, home to an award-winning, and within easy reach of Estelle Manor, Soho Farmhouse and The Club by Bamford.'\nCaliforniaEllen DeGeneres\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nEllen DeGeneres' flood-cursed Cotswolds farmhouse is OFF the market with rich American buyer poised to snap it up after she secretly slashed £4.5million off the £22million asking price\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy HANNAH MCDONALD, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:23:38 GMT, 28 January 2026 |Updated:00:19 GMT, 29 January 2026 \n\nBrooklyn Beckham's ex-girlfriend Afton McKeith has suggested his parents David and Victoria used to tip off the paparazzi on his whereabouts.\nThe eldest Beckham son, 26, went nuclear on his family last week and said he doesn't wish to reconcile with them. \nNow his ex-girlfriend has waded in on the drama, appearing to suggest that David and Victoria used to tell paparazzi where he was going to be so they would photograph him. \nAfton went to sixth form with Brooklyn in 2017 and the pair had a brief romance.\nSpeaking to ITV News on Wednesday, Afton, the daughter of TV personality Gillian McKeith, said: 'I could see that he would get visibly distressed and anxious. \n'I do know that there were paparazzi every single, like, pretty much every day. And somebody would've been organising that, who knew his schedule inside out because it's not like random.'\n\nBrooklyn Beckham's ex-girlfriend has suggested his parents David and Victoria used to tip off the paparazzi on his whereabouts (Brooklyn seen earlier this month)\n\nSpeaking to ITV News on Wednesday, Afton, the daughter of TV personality Gillian McKeith, said: 'I could see that he would get visibly distressed and anxious'\nWhen asked who she thought had been tipping off the paparazzi about Brooklyn's movements, Afton replied: 'I won't say who I think it was, but I have an idea in my mind. \n'I'm not going to implicate anybody.'\n\nShe was further probed, asking if she thought it was someone at school, to which she responded: 'No, I don't think it was anyone at school. \n'I think it was someone who knew his schedule from start to finish, of his day inside out, everywhere he went, what break he would've had. \n'So, you can think about who that might be that would know that.'\nWhen asked 'Surely not his parents?' Afton refused to comment further and shared a knowing look.\nAfton also talked about his decision to speak out now. She said: 'I think that Brooklyn made the right decision in coming out with a statement, because after many years, of what I think is a false narrative about Brooklyn and Nicola portrayed in the press publicly, it can become overwhelming and stressful to have an inaccurate narrative of yourself put out in the press constantly. \n'And so, it became too much for him. I think doing the best for your children is protecting your children. \n\nAfton has waded in on the drama, appearing to suggest that his parents David and Victoria used to tell paparazzi where he was going to be so they would photograph him (Brooklyn, Victoria and David seen in 2019)\n\nAfton McKeith went to sixth form with Brooklyn in 2017 and the pair had a brief romance (Seen in 2023)\n'And putting your children in the public eye is very exposing.'\nThe Daily Mail has contacted representatives for Brooklyn and David and Victoria for comment. \nIt comes after Brooklyn and Nicola Peltz's former wedding planner has waded into their family row and said he was 'surprised' by the aspiring chef's bombshell statement.\nTheir former wedding planner Preston Bailey shared that he was shocked he hit out against his parents in such a public and brutal manner.\nPreston was embroiled in wedding drama himself and didn't end up seeing their planning job through - instead going on to be replaced by Arianna Grijalba and Nicole Braghin.\nAfter quitting as the first planner - Bailey claimed at the time he was 'overcommitted' on other jobs so 'couldn't deliver to the quality I was used to.' He said in 2023: 'I have the best to say about the Peltzes and Nicola. There wasn't any bad blood.'\nIn a subsequent legal filing, Nicola's dad Nelson Peltz said Bailey encountered 'challenges' while planning the enormous event, which took place at the family estate in Palm Beach, Florida and reportedly cost around $3.5million.\nNow Preston has spoken of his experiences with Nicola and Brooklyn while he was still planning the wedding.\nHe told Page Six: 'It surprises me that he is taking this stand against his parents. That's not the Brooklyn I met as far as him being this nice, gentle guy... He was just a nice, regular person who would say hello and chit chat.\n\nLast Monday the 26-year-old son of David and Victoria went nuclear on his family and said he doesn't wish to reconcile with them and made several claims about their behaviour at his wedding (seen at their vow renewal last year)\n\n'I can tell you about my experience with Brooklyn. While we were planning, clearly as far as the details for the design, he was very much involved. I have always thought of him as a gentle, decent guy. There was never any tension.'\n'I don't remember her being bossy. I remember a lot of affection between them. Whatever design was done was presented to Nicola, but it was important for her to have Brooklyn approve it. She wasn't going to do anything without his approval.' \nNicola was portrayed as a 'nightmare bride' in a documentary about her bitter dispute with her wedding planners for her lavish 2022 nuptials. \nThe wedding took place in April 2022 in the Palm Beach, Florida, mansion of Nelson Peltz, Nicola's billionaire investor father.\nThe three-day event attracted celebrities like Eva Longoria, Gordon Ramsay and Venus and Serena Williams, as well as David and Victoria.\nBrooklyn Beckham\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBrooklyn Beckham's ex-girlfriend Afton McKeith suggests his parents David and Victoria used to tip off the paparazzi on his whereabouts\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 33\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy CAROLINE PEACOCK, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:22:19 GMT, 28 January 2026 |Updated:23:04 GMT, 28 January 2026 \n\nRomeo Beckham showed off his muscular physique as he posed for shirtless snaps on social media on Wednesday.\nThe son of David and Victoria Beckham, 23, took to Instagram in the midst of the family fall out with his older brother Brooklyn, 26. \nRomeo, who appeared to make a bold swipe at his sibling earlier this week with brother Cruz, 20, showed off his model credentials as he wore camouflage shorts, with his Calvin Klein underwear peeking out.\nCompleting his casual look with silver chains, Romeo showcased his toned and tattooed torso as he posed in a doorway.\nHe simply captioned the post with a French flag emoji, as he is currently in the city for Paris Fashion Week.\nEarlier this week, Romeo and his girlfriend Kim Turnbull supported his mum Victoria as she was named a Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters in Paris.\n\nRomeo Beckham showed off his muscular physique as he posed for shirtless snaps on social media on Wednesday\n\nThe son of David and Victoria Beckham, 23, took to Instagram wearing nothing but a pair of camouflage shorts, with his Calvin Klein underwear peeking out\nThe fashion designer, 51, was joined by David, 50, sons Romeo and Cruz, and daughter Harper, 14, at the ceremony, as well as several of her close friends and Romeo and Cruz's respective girlfriends Kim and Jackie Apostel.\nCruz, Jackie, Romeo and Kim have been inseparable during their Paris trip for Fashion Week, with the foursome enjoying dinner over the weekend.\nTaking to TikTok, the brothers filmed themselves in a car alongside the caption: 'Imagine hating and we’re just here like.'\nThe sweet display of brotherly love comes in stark contrast to Brooklyn's profession of his feelings towards his parents, who he denounced last week in the shocking statement and blasted his family's 'inauthentic' way.\nDespite this, Cruz seemed keen to make the statement through his playful Instagram post about resistance towards haters.\nPredictably, Brooklyn skipped out on the family trip - a week after he severed all ties with his family in a bombshell statement, opting instead to build a new life with his heiress wife Nicola Peltz in the US.\nIt marks only the latest family event to be snubbed by the aspiring chef, after he was previously a no-show at his father's milestone 50th birthday bash, the UK launch of his mother's Netflix show and to see David be knighted at Windsor Castle.\nHowever, the Beckham clan appeared determined not to allow their family drama to overshadow Victoria's big day, as she was presented with the prestigious accolade by the French Ministry of Culture.\n\nEarlier this week, Romeo and Cruz appeared to take a swipe at their estranged brother Brooklyn, as they hit Paris with their girlfriends \n\nIt comes the day after Romeo and his girlfriend Kim Turnbull supported his mum Victoria as she was named a Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters in Paris\n\nBut, predictably, eldest son Brooklyn, 26, yet again skipped out on the occasion - a week after he severed all ties with his family in a bombshell statement (seen with parents in 2019)\nThe award recognises the individual contributions of artists, writers, and cultural figures to the arts and literature, and previous recipients include Zoe Saldaña, Selena Gomez, Jude Law and Denis Villeneuve.\nAnd in her acceptance speech, the Spice Girl made special mention of her children, as she thanked them for 'always believing in my vision', despite Brooklyn's recent vitriolic claims against her.\nShe was presented the prestigious honour by the French Minister of Culture, Rachida Dati, who introduced her with an effusive speech.\nA slew of the biggest names in fashion were also on hand to support Victoria, including Vogue icon Anna Wintour, former British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful and French model Cindy Bruna.\nWhile Danish supermodel Helena Christensen, 57, was also spotted making a stylish exit from the ceremony, looking radiant in a silk gown under a Victoria Beckham wool coat.\nThe ceremony marked the Beckham clan's first public appearance since Brooklyn's damning statement - with the family putting on a very united front.\nThey have maintained a stoic silence since the influencer claimed he has been 'controlled by a family that values public promotion above all else' and that since being with Nicola, 31, he has found 'peace and relief' after battling crippling anxiety.\nAmong the long list of claims he made was that Victoria pulled out of designing his bride's wedding dress at the 'eleventh hour' and then 'hijacked' the first dance at his wedding and 'danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone'. \n\nThey have maintained a stoic silence since the influencer claimed he has been 'controlled by a family that values public promotion above all else' and that since being with Nicola, 31, he has found 'peace and relief' after battling crippling anxiety (seen in October)\n\nVictoria is said to be 'feeling betrayed' by Brooklyn's bombshell statement and dancing revelations after her years spent protecting him from 'dark stories'.\nThe Daily Mail's Katie Hind previously explained how the Beckhams' camp 'leapt into overdrive in Brooklyn's defence' when stories such as kiss and tells and tales of him being 'involved with the wrong crowd' surfaced. \nHis parents have often instructed expensive lawyers to protect him against such stories. \nDavid and Victoria would 'take Brooklyn back in a minute' and are said to be 'horrified' by events this week, according to another source.\nFollowing Brooklyn's claims about his mother hijacking his first dance, the couple's wedding DJ, Fat Tony, later recounted the exact detail of the incident during an appearance on This Morning. \nThe 60-year-old branded the dance 'really awkward' and confirmed that Nicola fled the reception in tears.\nTony, a longtime friend of the Beckhams, claimed that Marc Anthony was to blame, revealing the musician had called Victoria to the dance floor with her son and instructed him, 'place your hands on your mother's hips'. \n\nBrooklyn Beckham's statement in full\n\nI have been silent for years and made every effort to keep these matters private. Unfortunately, my parents and their team have continued to go to the press, leaving me with no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth about only some of the lies that have been printed.\nI do not want to reconcile with my family. I'm not being controlled, I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life. For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family. The performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships have been a fixture of the life I was born into.\nRecently, I have seen with my own eyes the lengths that they'll go through to place countless lies in the media, mostly at the expense of innocent people, to preserve their own facade. But I believe the truth always comes out.\nMy parents have been trying endlessly to ruin my relationship since before my wedding, and it hasn't stopped. My mum cancelled making Nicola's dress in the eleventh hour despite how excited she was to wear her design, forcing her to urgently find a new dress. \nWeeks before our big day, my parents repeatedly pressured and attempted to bribe me into signing away the rights to my name, which would have affected me, my wife, and our future children.\nThey were adamant on me signing before my wedding date because then the terms of the deal would be initiated. My holdout affected the payday, and they have never treated me the same since. \nDuring the wedding planning, my mum went so far as to call me \"evil\" because Nicola and I chose to include my Nanny Sandra, and Nicola's Naunni at our table, because they both didn't have their husbands. Both of our parents had their own tables equally adjacent to ours.\nThe night before our wedding, members of my family told me that Nicola was \"not blood\" and \"not family.\" Since the moment I started standing up for myself with my family, I've received endless attacks from my parents, both privately and publicly, that were sent to the press on their orders.\nEven my brothers were sent to attack me on social media, before they ultimately blocked me out of nowhere this last Summer. \nMy mum hijacked my first dance with my wife, which had been planned weeks in advance to a romantic love song. In front of our 500 wedding guests, Marc Anthony called me to the stage, where in the schedule was planned to be my romantic dance with my wife but instead my mum was waiting to dance with me instead. \nShe danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone. I've never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in my entire life. We wanted to renew our vows so we could create new memories of our wedding day that bring us joy and happiness, not anxiety and embarrassment.\nMy wife has been consistently disrespected by my family, no matter how hard we've tried to come together as one. My mum has repeatedly invited women from my past into our lives in ways that were clearly intended to make us both uncomfortable.\nDespite this, we still travelled to London for my dad's birthday and were rejected for a week as we waited in our hotel room trying to plan quality time with him. He refused all of our attempts, unless it was at his big birthday party with a hundred guests and cameras at every corner.\nWhen he finally agreed to see me, it was under the condition that Nicola wasn't invited. It was a slap in the face. Later, when my family travelled to LA, they refused to see me at all.\nMy family values public promotion and endorsements above all else. Brand Beckham comes first. Family \"love\" is decided by how much you post on social media, or how quickly you drop everything to show up and pose for a family photo opp, even if it's at the expense of our professional obligations.\nWe've gone out of our way for years to show up and support at every fashion show, every party, and every press activity to show 'our perfect family.' But the one time my wife asked for my mum's support to save displaced dogs during the LA fires, my mum refused.\nThe narrative that my wife controls me is completely backwards. I have been controlled by my parents for most of my life. I grew up with overwhelming anxiety. For the first time in my life, since stepping away from my family, that anxiety has disappeared.\nI wake up every morning grateful for the life I chose, and have found peace and relief. My wife and I do not want a life shaped by image, press, or manipulation. All we want peace, privacy and happiness for us and our future family. \nParisInstagramVictoria BeckhamRomeo Beckham\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRomeo Beckham showcases his toned and tattooed physique as he poses shirtless - following THAT bold swipe at 'hater' Brooklyn\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 21\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

When a society can no longer recognize the natural difference between men and women, it has abandoned civilization itself. \n\nWhen we deny the differences, collapse the distinctions, and confuse our definitions of man and woman, that is not a feature of civilization. It is the defining mark of barbarism, and transgenderism is its modern expression.\n\nPoll after poll shows a growing majority of Americans are against transgender issues and policies, from men in women’s sports to transgender procedures for minors, to men in women’s bathrooms. Some of these issues are now 80-20 issues.\n\nIt’s a remarkable feat, and it also makes one wonder how the conservative movement has had such resounding success against transgenderism when it resoundingly lost a very similar battle, the battle to defend traditional marriage.\n\nTerry Schilling, the president of the American Principles Project, has been a driving force in combating transgenderism all over the country. He’s one of the few people who really saw transgenderism coming, and he’s smart enough to have learned from the mistakes made in the fight to protect traditional marriage and apply those lessons to fighting transgenderism.\n\nSchilling joined “The Signal Sitdown” this week to discuss.\n\nShilling unpacks how transgenderism emerged as a political issue and how the right has managed to make transgenderism so politically toxic that the most effective advertisement in the 2024 election cycle was “Kamala Harris is for they/them.”\n\nDespite the successes of the Trump administration and recent votes in the House, however, there’s more work to be done to fully defeat transgenderism.\n\n“I think it’s all federal at this point,” Schilling told The Daily Signal. “The states are good for temporary victories that can help build momentum, but we need to get federal victories.”\n\n“Ban all sex-change procedures and surgeries for minors and give liability protections for the adults,” which would allow them to sue if they later seek to detransition, Schilling continued, “pass a national women’s sports law,” and “protect private spaces.”","summary":"The following is a preview of Daily Signal Politics Editor Bradley Devlin’s interview with Terry Schilling, president of the American Principles Project, on “The Signal...

For instance, he calls ICE “occupiers” and “thugs,” and calls the president “King Trump,” while praising the violent anti-ICE protesters as “citizens standing for justice” who are being gunned down by ICE.\n\nNaturally, Springsteen did not mention all the months of violence perpetrated by the anti-ICE insurrectionists, nor the thousands of dangerous criminals, including rapists, sexual assaulters, drug dealers, gang members, drunk drivers, and murderers that ICE and Border Patrol agents have arrested and set for deportation off our streets.\n\nThrough the winter’s ice and cold\nDown Nicollet Avenue\nA city aflame fought fire and ice\n‘Neath an occupier’s boots\nKing Trump’s private army from the DHS\nGuns belted to their coats\nCame to Minneapolis to enforce the law\nOr so their story goes\nAgainst smoke and rubber bullets\nBy the dawn’s early light\nCitizens stood for justice\nTheir voices ringing through the night\nAnd there were bloody footprints\nWhere mercy should have stood\nAnd two dead left to die on snow-filled streets\nAlex Pretti and Renee Good\nOh our Minneapolis, I hear your voice\nSinging through the bloody mist\nWe’ll take our stand for this land\nAnd the stranger in our midst\nHere in our home they killed and roamed\nIn the winter of ’26\nWe’ll remember the names of those who died\nOn the streets of Minneapolis\nTrump’s federal thugs beat up on\nHis face and his chest\nThen we heard the gunshots\nAnd Alex Pretti lay in the snow, dead\nTheir claim was self defense, sir\nJust don’t believe your eyes\nIt’s our blood and bones\nAnd these whistles and phones\nAgainst Miller and Noem’s dirty lies\nOh our Minneapolis, I hear your voice\nCrying through the bloody mist\nWe’ll remember the names of those who died\nOn the streets of Minneapolis\nNow they say they’re here to uphold the law\nBut they trample on our rights\nIf your skin is black or brown my friend\nYou can be questioned or deported on sight\nIn chants of ICE out now\nOur city’s heart and soul persists\nThrough broken glass and bloody tears\nOn the streets of Minneapolis\nOh our Minneapolis, I hear your voice\nSinging through the bloody mist\nHere in our home they killed and roamed\nIn the winter of ’26\nWe’ll take our stand for this land\nAnd the stranger in our midst\nWe’ll remember the names of those who died\nOn the streets of Minneapolis\nWe’ll remember the names of those who died\nOn the streets of Minneapolis\n\nSpringsteen took to social media and explained why he released the song.\n\n“I wrote this song on Saturday, recorded it yesterday and released it to you today in response to the state terror being visited on the city of Minneapolis,” he said on Bluesky. “It’s dedicated to the people of Minneapolis, our innocent immigrant neighbors and in memory of Alex Pretti and Renee Good. Stay free.”\n\nI wrote this song on Saturday, recorded it yesterday and released it to you today in response to the state terror being visited on the city of Minneapolis. It’s dedicated to the people of Minneapolis, our innocent immigrant neighbors and in memory of Alex Pretti and Renee Good.\n\n— Bruce Springsteen (@brucespringsteen.net) January 28, 2026 at 12:02 PM\n\nSpringsteen was a major supporter of Joe Biden who is responsible for opening the southern border wide open and creating the dangerous situation we now face that spurred President Trump to run on a promise to launch one of the biggest deportation policies in presidential history.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy DEIRDRE DURKAN-SIMONDS, US ASSOCIATE SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:22:20 GMT, 28 January 2026 |Updated:22:25 GMT, 28 January 2026 \n\nKim Kardashian has finally addressed the mystery behind why photos of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle vanished from her Instagram following mom Kris Jenner's milestone 70th birthday celebration.\nIn November 2025, confused fans questioned why snaps of the Sussexes inside the star-studded LA event had disappeared off social media - after the former working Royals were happily photographed earlier in the evening on their way into the James Bond-themed soiree.\nWhile appearing on sister Khloe Kardashian's podcast Khloe in Wonder Land this week, the reality star and Skims founder, 45, spoke candidly about the so-called 'Photogate' for the first time, stressing that the decision was made out of respect, not controversy.\n'It was really innocent, which is so crazy,' Kim explained. 'Mom and Meghan have been friends for some years now, and they have a really sweet relationship.'\nKim went on to claim that the Sussexes had initially given the green light for the images, which were taken during Jenner's star-studded birthday bash, to be shared publicly.\n'We were told that it was totally cool to post,' she claimed. 'And then after it was posted, I think they realized it was Remembrance Day, and they didn't want to be seen at a party, even though it's already up, you know, and then taken down. And then I think they realized, like, \"Oh, this was so silly.\"'\n\nKim Kardashian has finally addressed the mystery behind why photos of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle vanished from her Instagram following mom Kris Jenner's 70th birthday party\n\nIn November 2025, confused fans questioned why snaps of the Sussexes inside the LA event had disappeared off social media - after the former working Royals were happily photographed on their way into the James Bond-themed soiree at Jeff Bezos' mansion (pictured)\nShe added that while Prince Harry and Markle were photographed attending the Baby2Baby charity gala the same evening, there was a distinction to be made.\n'That was fine, but maybe not partying and dancing on the dance floor or whatever,' Kim noted. 'So we took them down to respect Remembrance Day.'\nRemembrance Day, observed annually in November, honors members of the armed forces who lost their lives in service.\nPrince Harry was notably seen wearing a poppy badge - an emblem of Remembrance Day - on his way into Jenner's party at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's mansion.\n\n Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner DELETE photos with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle \nThe Daily Mail has reached out to the Sussexes' representatives for comment, but has not heard back, at this time. \nJenner's birthday celebration took place the night before royals gathered at London's Cenotaph for the annual service.\nAs she reflected on the unexpected backlash, Kim admitted the situation spiraled far beyond what anyone intended.\n'You got to laugh at, like, the situation sometimes and just, like, lighten it up and be if everyone's taking it the wrong way, like, lean in,' she said, joking that she even suggested turning the moment into a tongue-in-cheek Skims campaign.\n'We should do a full Skims campaign,' Kim recalled. 'Take the photo - even just us, like, I'll shoot you at mom, you know, post it and then delete it, like, 30 minutes later. And then I say, 'Oh, sorry, I didn't have permission to post those photos for the campaign.'\n\nWhile appearing on sister Khloe Kardashian's podcast Khloe in Wonder Land, the reality star and Skims founder, 45, spoke candidly about the so-called 'Photogate' for the first time, stressing that the decision was made out of respect, not controversy - pictured at the event \n\n'It was really innocent, which is so crazy,' Kim (seen with her mom in 2024) explained. 'Mom and Meghan have been friends for some years now, and they have a really sweet relationship'\n\nJenner posed with Beyoncé and enjoyed a dance session with Justin Bieber as she shared behind-the-scenes snaps from her birthday bash (Tina Knowles seen left)\nStill, Kim emphasized that the entire saga left her feeling a bit disappointed.\n'If we just made it light and made it funny, you know, I think it would have been, like, received differently,' she said. 'But I hated how that was received for everyone. That sucks. It was just made into something that was so crazy and ridiculous that just didn't have to be.'\nThe deleted images included Kardashian and Meghan, 44, posing together while smiling for the camera, as the Duke of Sussex, 41, was seen chatting with someone in the background.\nAnother picture was taken from behind Jenner as Meghan placed her hand on her shoulder, while Harry made a silly face toward her. \nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not the only big names at the event as Jenner posed with Beyoncé and enjoyed a dance session with Justin Bieber as she shared behind-the-scenes snaps from her Bond-themed bash.\n\n Why Prince Harry and Meghan Markle photos were removed from Kris Jenner's posts \nThe celebrated momager also shared a photo of herself dancing up a storm with Bieber, who gave her a respectful bow on the dance floor.\nBeyond the royal moment, the sisters' podcast conversation remained playful, touching on family dinners, everyday routines, and even recent Malibu get-togethers attended by younger sister Kylie Jenner and her boyfriend Timothée Chalamet.\nKhloe went on to praise Kylie for staying out late during a recent intimate dinner, with Kim adding that Kylie and Timothée 'had the best time,' as the sisters laughed about being exhausted afterward.\nThe episode also featured a lighthearted round of the game When Was the Last Time, with Kim candidly admitted it had been years since she's gone to a supermarket.\nIn the first part of their interview, which was broken into two episodes, Kim finally tackled where she stands with Taylor Swift after their feud.\nThe drama goes way back to 2016, when West's song Famous dropped and Kim leaked edited phone calls that made Swift look like a liar - sparking snake emojis, fan rage and fueling the Reputation album. \nAfter being named TIME’s Person of the Year in 2023, Swift threw shade at Kim, claiming she 'took her down psychologically' and forced her into hiding, sending the feud back into headlines. \nWith the Swift feud hanging in the air, Khloe asked the question everyone was waiting for: 'Do you think people would be surprised you listen to Taylor Swift?' \n\n'We were told that it was totally cool to post,' she claimed. 'And then after it was posted, I think they realized it was Remembrance Day, and they didn't want to be seen at a party \n\nPrince Harry was notably seen wearing a poppy badge - an emblem of Remembrance Day - on his way into Jenner's party at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's mansion (pictured) \n\nIn the first part of their interview, which was broken into two episodes, Kim finally tackled where she stands with Taylor Swift after their feud (pictured in 2015)\n\nKim replied, 'I think I’ve said it.'\nKhloe chimed in, 'I think people would be surprised.'\n'Yeah, it’s just… I have some of her older songs in my playlist,' Kim admitted. 'I’ve always thought she’s a super talented, great artist.'\nAnd just like that, Swift was off the table, as Khloe quickly pivoted: 'So… do you like country music?'\nKim lit up: 'I love country music! I’ll always be a Shania Twain girl. I love Carrie Underwood. And Lee Ann Rimes - obsessed.'\nInstagramMeghan MarkleKris Jenner\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKim Kardashian breaks silence on why Prince Harry and Meghan Markle photos were deleted from Kris Jenner's birthday post\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 74\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

His call and eye-witness account were entered into evidence.\n\n'I'm calling from the US, I just got a call from a girl… she's getting beat up,' Barron said, according to a transcript. 'This was happening about eight minutes ago. I just figured out how to, how to call someone. It's really an emergency.'\n\nRumiantsev has now been convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and obstruction of justice for encouraging the woman to drop the charges.\n\nThis whole saga is troubling on many levels. This Rumiantsev's behavior is, of course, abominable and I feel terrible for his young victim.\n\nBut there's another concern, too… what the heck is Barron getting into?\n\nI know he's all of 19 years old, but shouldn't someone be keeping a closer eye on him? I thought helicopter mom Melania was all over this like a MQ-9 Reaper drone on a Venezuelan drug boat.\n\nIt's not ridiculous to ask why the Secret Service weren't on the horn to their British counterparts and instead left Barron scrambling to figure out the UK country code.\n\nRemember, Daddy Trump had already been re-elected. Barron was likely already cooking up what he was going to whisper into Sleepy Joe's ear in the Rotunda.\n\nPaging the CIA: were you guys listening to the call?\n\nOne would think that the son of a man whose first White House term was derailed by a Kremlin collusion hoax spread by an ex-British spy would steer clear of conversations with woman living in London and dating unhinged Russian dudes.\n\nBarron, ask George Papadopoulos how that turned out for him!\n\nAnd there's something else concerning about this case.\n\nRumiantsev suggested in court that this woman was manipulating Barron in some way.\n\n'What I was really unhappy about was that she was frankly leading him [Barron] on,' the convicted creep claimed, adding, 'I want to just make clear that her actions towards him was wrong and it was not fair.'\n\n'Leading him on' how, is my question.\n\nAm I starting to sound like Robert Mueller?\n\nWell, excuse me if I don't have some lingering PTSD from the Russia, Russia, Russia fiasco.\n\nI've written about my concerns for Barron before and I have great sympathy for him.\n\nHow would you like being the most scrutinized sophomore in the country – child to the most scrutinized couple in American history?\n\nNo wonder – as was revealed in the UK court case – that Barron met this mystery woman online. How else is he going to find friends?\n\nLast year, my college-aged daughters informed me that he was being dragged on one of the hottest new dating apps – and he reportedly uses gaming platforms to communicate with pals and classmates.\n\nForget free Britney. Free Barron!\n\nIndeed, it's a sign of the times that young adults live their lives online. But let's please make sure that this 6ft 9in princeling doesn't inadvertently stumble into any more trouble.\n\nMinnesota mean\n\nSpeaking of our fine First Lady, she issued a rare public statement Tuesday in the wake of the deadly shooting of ICU nurse Alex Pretti.\n\nMelania called on the country to 'unify' and praised her husband for diplomatically reaching out to Governor Goofus (Tim Walz) and Mayor Mayhem (Jacob Frey).\n\nThe good news is I think we're all unified in hoping that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem is fired.\n\nHarry situation\n\nA bedazzled Harry Styles is launching his Together, Together tour after an excruciating four-year hiatus, but what's really painful are his ticket prices.\n\nA decent seat at Madison Square Garden will cost you around $1,000. And if you don't live near NYC, get ready to shell out more scratch for travel: his 30-date residency at MSG is his only US venue.\n\nWe belong together? Harry, we don't even belong in the same tax bracket!\n\nSnuggle bug\n\nOur formidable Secretary of State Marco Rubio confessed in a new interview that he hides under a blanket 'like a mummy' on Air Force One flights to avoid his notoriously nocturnal boss.\n\nApparently, Trump likes to wake people up in the middle of the night to chat.\n\nOne cabinet member confided to me that Rubio's sleep deficit became so serious that he took a completely different plane on a recent trip just so he could finally get some shut eye.\n\nSneak peaks\n\nEveryone's favorite MAGA pinup girl was admonished by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce for hanging her bras and underwear off the Hollywood sign 'without license or permission.'\n\nBut Sydney Sweeney's no boob.\n\nThe titillating stunt promoted her new lingerie brand, SYRN. Whether it's 'white supremacist' jeans ads, used bath water or illicit unmentioned, Syd knows how to peddle her wares.\n\nBeloved 'One Day at a Time' star Valerie Bertinelli is boo-hooing about being fired from an unnamed weight loss company for gaining weight.\n\nThat's like a skin care spokesperson showing up on the red carpet with a big fat zit.\n\nYou had one job, Valerie!\n\nCausing a racket \n\nTennis star Coco Gauff channeled her inner Kurt Cobain and smashed her tennis racket like it was on fire after a humiliating 59-minute Australian Open loss to Elina Svitolina.\n\nTo her credit, she didn't vandalize her instrument mid-court but waited until she was backstage thinking she could rage out of camera-view.\n\nNope! The typically mature 21-year-old is allowed to vent, and though she normally carries herself with the grace of a more mature player, this smells like teen spirit.\n\nC-list star… crossed\n\nKim Kardashian is the Jackie of all trades: porn star, pubic toupee purveyor and 'actress.'\n\nAfter being panned for her first two silver screen gigs, Kimberly is set to star in an Eva Longoria-directed Netflix comedy 'The Fifth Wheel.'\n\nIf the 'Kardashian Curse' is any indicator, that flick was doomed from the moment she was cast.\n\nDr No Brains\n\nGovernor Josh Shapiro blew the lid of Kamala Harris's failed presidential campaign in a new book.\n\nApparently, when the Kackler's team vetted him for VP they asked him if he'd been an Israeli double agent.\n\nThe question isn't just wildly offensive – it's dumb.\n\nIf he's a double agent, he wouldn't tell you!","summary":"I've written about my concerns for Barron before and I have great sympathy for him.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy NICK FAGGE, SENIOR REPORTER and NICK CRAVEN, SENIOR REPORTER \n Published:21:27 GMT, 28 January 2026 |Updated:21:27 GMT, 28 January 2026 \n\nIt was an extraordinary detail in an otherwise all too commonplace scenario of domestic violence that prompted the case at a minor London criminal court to be reported around the world.\nBecause the crucial witness who had alerted police to the assault from 3,500 miles away was none other than the son of the president of the USA, Barron Trump.\nThanks to his early hours intervention the son of a wealthy Russian coffee shop magnate was today convicted of assaulting his girlfriend in a jealous rage.\nDonald Trump's son Barron, 19, had been on a call to the female victim on FaceTime, only to see her being viciously attacked in her London flat by Matvei Rumiantsev on January 18 last year, just two days before his father's second inauguration as President.\nHorrified at what he saw, Trump Junior found a way to contact the emergency services and told a City of London Police operator: 'I just got a call from a girl... she's getting beat up,' Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.\nProsecutors said that ex-MMA fighter Rumiantsev was jealous of her friendship with Mr Trump.\nThe 22-year-old son of a Russian coffee tycoon, who went to an £80,000-a-year UK boarding school and lived in Canary Wharf, east London, was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and perverting the course of justice.\nHe was found not guilty of one count of rape and intentional strangulation relating to the same date when Mr Trump made his report to police and cleared of another count of rape and assault in November 2024.\nWhen Rumiantsev answered the video call on the girl's phone, he showed Barron her face then grabbed her hair and pushed her to the floor, shouting 'you are not worth anything', the court heard.\n\nMatvei Rumianstev (pictured) was today found guilty of beating up his girlfriend while she was on a FaceTime call with Barron Trump - but was cleared of raping her\n\nJurors at a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court were told to treat Barron Trump's (pictured) account of his friend's alleged attack with caution and consider if it may be biased or mistaken\nHe had called the woman a 'slut' and a 'whore' and kicked her in the stomach when she was on the floor next to the fridge.\nIt is believed the victim is British, of Belarussian descent, in her 20s and the daughter of an influencer.\nIn a transcript of the call he made to the emergency services, Mr Trump said: 'Oh I'm calling from the US, uh I just got a call from a girl, you know, she's getting beat up', the court heard.\nMr Trump replied to investigating police in May in an email which said 'what I saw was very brief indeed but indeed prevalent'.\nIt continued: 'I didn't expect her to pick up due to the difference in the time zone to the fact I am in the USA, the phone was answered but not by her, to my dismay.\n'The individual who picked up the phone was a shirtless man with darkish hair, although I didn't get a good look, this view lasted maybe one second and I was racing with adrenaline.\n'The camera was then flipped to the victim getting hit while crying, stating something in Russian. The guy had hung up. This whole interaction had lasted 5 to 7 seconds.'\nProsecutor Serena Gates said that Rumiantsev was jealous of the woman's friendship with Mr Trump, perhaps because of his 'public profile'.\nShe told jurors to note Mr Trump's 'urgent' and 'worried' tone in the call to police.\nThe court had heard that Rumiantsev and the woman had been drinking together on the evening of January 17, 2025 and into the early hours of the next day.\nThe prosecution said that Rumiantsev assaulted the woman that day, including hitting her in the face.\n\nRussian national Matvei Rumiantsev was accused of repeatedly punching Barron's female friend in a flat in London while President Trump's son was on a FaceTime call to her from the US\n\nRumiantsev (pictured centre) denied allegations including assault, two counts of rape and intentional strangulation\nRumiantsev became aware of the woman's friendship with Mr Trump in October 2024. In court, he was asked if he was jealous of males that the woman might speak to.\n'What I was really unhappy about was that she was frankly leading him (Barron Trump) on,' he replied.\nRumiantsev told the court: 'I am being portrayed as a jealous person who can lose his temper due to jealousy. I want to just make clear that her actions towards him was wrong and it was not fair.'\nHe added: 'I was jealous to some extent.'\nThe perverting the course of justice charged relates to a letter written to the woman by Rumiantsev from prison after the January 18 attack, asking her to withdraw her allegations.\nRumiantsev attended an elite international boarding school in Cambridge.\nHis father, Sergey Rumyantsev, 53, is founder of a prominent Russian business success story called One Price Coffee, previously called One Bucks Coffee, until US coffee giant Starbucks challenged the name in court, forcing them to drop the 'Bucks' from their name.\nMatvei's father is listed in Companies House records as a director of One Price Coffee, and was born into a military family in Severomorsk, a closed Soviet naval town in the Arctic region of Murmansk.\nSergey attended the Tver Suvorov Military School from the age of 14, a prestigious cadet institution exclusively for the children of military families.\nMatvei's grandfather Vitaly Rumyantsev, now 86, was a senior naval officer, believed to be a captain.\nThe family is clearly wealthy and successful in Putin's Russia. Before founding One Price Coffee, among other jobs, Sergey worked for British American Tobacco in sales, followed by Nike in international brand management and wholesale operations.\nIt is believed that Matvei came to Britain to study for GCSEs then A Levels, and he attended the elite Abbey College Cambridge, where boarding fees are set at that hefty £80k per year rate.\nHe can be seen in a college 2021 Alumni Reunion photo.\nThe school is known as an elite academy for the children of wealthy foreigners, and a likely passport to good UK universities.\nRumiantsev will be sentenced at the same court on March 27.\n\nTranscript of Barron Trump's call with the City of London Police where he was asked not to be rude\n\nA police call operator told US President Donald Trump's youngest son to 'stop being rude' when he contacted police in the UK after receiving a call from a woman who was being attacked, a court has heard.\nMatvei Rumiantsev, 22, is on trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court accused of assault and two counts of rape, among other charges, against the alleged victim, who is friends with Barron Trump.\nJurors heard Mr Trump video-called the alleged victim, a woman in London who cannot be named for legal reasons, and saw her being attacked on January 18 last year.\nRumiantsev denies assault, actual bodily harm, intentional strangulation, perverting the course of justice and two counts of rape, and the trial continues.\nHere is the transcript of Mr Trump's call to the City of London Police as redacted by the Crown Prosecution Service to preserve the anonymity of the victim.\nOperator: 'City of London Police, how can I help you?'\nBarron: 'Oh I'm calling from the US, uh I just got a call from a girl, you know, she's getting beat up. The address is (redacted).'\nOperator: 'Yeah.'\nBarron: '(Redacted). This was happening about eight minutes ago. I just figured out how to, how to call someone. Uh, uh it's really an emergency.'\nOperator: 'What's her name?'\nBarron: 'Her name is (redacted).'\nOperator: 'Her date of birth?'\nBarron: 'She's (inaudible), she's (inaudible), it's really an emergency please.'\nOperator: 'Yeah I know, what's her age?'\nBarron: '(Redacted).'\nOperator: '(Redacted) how do you know her?'\nBarron: 'I mean these details don't matter, she's getting beat up like I-'\nOperator: 'Yeah I know but I need to take information from you, so how have you come by this information?'\nBarron: 'Uh I got a call from her with a guy beating her up.'\nOperator: 'Okay how do you know her?'\nBarron: 'I don't think these details matter she's getting beat up but okay fine, also I met her on social media, I don't think that matters.'\nOperator: 'You know I can-'\nBarron: 'She's getting beat up.'\nOperator: 'Can you stop being rude and actually answer my questions. If you want to help the person, you'll answer my questions clearly and precisely, thank you. So how do you know her?'\nBarron: 'I met her on social media.'\nOperator: 'OK.'\nOperator: 'Know the partner's name or the person that's beating her up at all?'\nBarron: 'No.'\nOperator: 'And they're at home, they're not out into the street?'\nBarron: 'Yes, correct.'\nBarron: 'She's getting really badly beat up and the call was about eight minutes ago, I don't know what could have happened by now.'\nOperator: 'OK.'\nBarron: 'So, sorry for being rude.'\nOperator: '(Inaudible)'.\nBarron: '(Inaudible).'\nBarron: 'For a reason I don't know (inaudible).'\nOperator: 'You saw a video on social media, what like a video call?'\nBarron: 'No, No, I (inaudible) a video call.'\n\nLondonBarron Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRevealed: Truth behind Barron Trump's dramatic Facetime phone call with 'girlfriend' and the British public school-educated MMA fighter who beat her up\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

The deaths of two U.S. citizens at the hands of federal law enforcement in January have caused a severe divide between state and local leadership and the federal government.\n\nVance has been vocal about his distaste for Walz and Minnesota leadership while also strongly defending immigration operations in the state. \n\n“They have created the chaos so they can have moments like yesterday, where someone tragically dies and politicians get to grandstand about the evils of enforcing the border,” Vance said in an X post Jan. 25. “The solution is staring everyone in the face. I hope authorities in Minneapolis stop this madness.”\n\nThe proposition of trading blows came when Miller asked Walz if he gave Vance “too much benefit of the doubt” on the debate stage in 2024. \n\nWalz may not have been suggesting actual violence, but rather that if the two stepped on the debate stage today, the governor would have better arguments prepared.\n\nIn reminiscing on the past vice presidential debates, where Walz was Kamala Harris’s No. 2, he said he was “sucked in” to the statements made by Vance. \n\n“Making the case that housing prices are up because of immigration and that we should build on federal lands, it was such a crazy thing,” Walz said. “But then when I watched him, I got sucked into that. And if you remember, this was right in that moment of eating dogs and cats. I took that bait and thought that that was the argument of how outrageous it was. That was not the argument.”\n\nThe interview came as Walz prepared to meet with border czar Tom Homan to discuss federal enforcement operations in Minnesota.\n\nHoman said the meeting with Walz was productive, and while they can’t agree on everything, they need to support law enforcement in the mission of keeping the public safe. \n\nThe meeting was set up after Trump had phone calls with both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey in an effort to mediate rising tensions in Minnesota.","summary":"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) said on Tuesday that he “would beat the s*** out of” Vice President JD Vance if given the chance, a remark that underscored his frustration with calls for bipartisanship amid escalating political tensions over immigration and enforcement.

I’m not afraid of you, Stephen Miller,' Garcia said.\n\nRepresentatives Carlos Gimenez and Maria Elvira Salazar haven't called for Miller or Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's head, but did warn the party was in political hot water.\n\n'I warned about this months ago, before the headlines caught up. Today we are watching it unfold in real time,' Salazar posted to X Tuesday night. 'Hispanics are leaving the GOP in large numbers, and pretending otherwise won't fix it.'\n\nShe implored her party to 'reverse course and act now.'\n\nGimenez didn't specifically cite concerns about losing Latino voters when speaking to Newsmax Tuesday, but did say he was worried about the November races, which historically could turn the House of Representatives over to the Democrats.\n\nGimenez said he's expressed to the Trump administration, 'there has to be a better way to do this.'\n\n'And also, this is politically, it's hurting our chances at the midterm. And I'm just being frank about it,' Gimenez said. \n\nTrump made huge gains with Latino voters in the 2024 race.\n\nHe lost them by 38 points in 2016 to Democrat Hillary Clinton. \n\nEight years later, Trump lost Latinos by just three points to the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris - and won Latino men. \n\nBut during the 2025 off-year elections, Latino voters headed back to the Democratic column in droves, helping elect Democratic governors in both Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nSalazar first spoke out then. \n\n'I've said it before, the Hispanic vote is not guaranteed,' she said in a video post on November 5, the day after the election. 'Hispanics married President Trump, they're only dating the GOP.' \n\nShe said that while Latino voters wanted to get rid of the 'bad Hombres,' they also wanted to 'give dignity to those who have been here for years, and do not have a criminal record, people that may not have a legality, but who have been here contributing to the economy and to the country.' \n\nThings on the immigration front have only gotten more heated since then, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents descending on Minneapolis, killing two American citizens and detaining a 5-year-old child.\n\nIn the latest Daily Mail/J.L. Partners poll, which was conducted Monday, 51 percent of Latino voters said they disapproved of the Trump administration's record on immigration - higher than the 44 percent of white voters who held the same sentiment.\n\nFifty-eight percent of Latino voters disapproved of ICE specifically, compared to 50 percent of white registered voters.\n\nAnd 57 percent of Latino voters said they believed that ICE should pull out of U.S. cities, with 50 percent of white voters in agreement.\n\nAnother 48 percent of Latino voters said that Noem should be fired, and 49 percent said she should be impeached by Congress.\n\nPollsters did not ask about the fate of Miller, an immigration hardliner who worked for Trump during his first administration as well. \n\nHowever, one sliver of good news for Trump is that his numbers haven't cratered with Latinos despite strong feelings on immigration enforcement.\n\nHe's currently holding at 42 percent approval, 58 percent disapproval with the important voting bloc. \n\n'Trump's numbers with Hispanics are actually holding up relatively well,' J.L. Partners pollster James Johnson told the Daily Mail. \n\nThe only problem for November - Trump won't be on the ballot.","summary":"Latino Republican lawmakers are warning that the GOP could lose the midterms - in part, thanks to dwindling Latino support - over President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15505693/republicans-fleeing-hispanics-trump-stephen-miller.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/28/20/105909891-0-image-m-38_1769632013162.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 20:57:26","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.102},{"id":397112490,"title":"Airbnb 'refused to ban guest who racially abused host over temperature of flat' and instead suggested 'she post a response online'","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nThe Crime Desk\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Jan 28th 2026\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo DHS agents put on leave over deadly Minneapolis shooting of nurse Alex Pretti\n\nTragic Noah Donohoe, 14, fell off his bike and was seen undressing in the street on the day he went missing, witnesses say - but he didn't seem to have a head injury that would explain how he ended dying naked in a storm drain\n\nIran tells Trump 'our fingers are on the trigger': Tehran warns it will 'respond like never before' if US carries out military strikes after president warned of 'major destruction'\n\nStacey Solomon's 'ruthless' behaviour with Essex's mumfluencers exposed: From the Style Sisters to Mrs Hinch and now Money Mum, insiders tell 'there's only so much money to go around', her 'uncanny' habit... and reveal 'frenemy' drama\n\nA renovation left me £20,000 in debt.

Email adam.pogrund@dailymail.co.uk \nBy ADAM POGRUND, TRAINEE REPORTER\n Published:20:49 GMT, 28 January 2026 |Updated:20:53 GMT, 28 January 2026 \n\nA university lecturer was left 'shaking and unable to sleep' after Airbnb refused to ban a guest who racially abused her.\nBaoxiu Qi, a biomolecular science lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University, was the victim of the attack following a dispute over the temperature of her flat.\nSimone Kyriakopoulou, 49, who runs a Greek food van, launched the vile racist tirade against the host and submitted a wave of negative reviews as she checked out of the Bath property in December.\nMs Kyriakopoulou spent 20 days at the property as she manned a stand at the Bath Christmas Market.\nIn an apparent attempt to claim a refund, she complained she could not breathe in the house because of asbestos even though the Georgian Grade I listed property was built more than a century before the material was used in homes.\nShe then sent a series of racist messages to the host, calling her a 'dictator from China', claiming she is from an 'uncivilised background' and that she is not English despite her passport.\nAirbnb initially refused to ban her despite 'relentless complaints', instead telling Ms Qi to 'post a professional public response to address the feedback'. She was removed following enquiries from the Daily Mail.\nThe lecturer, a super host who has used the booking platform for 11 years, has since lost numerous bookings and around £4,000 following the negative reviews and messages.\n\nBaoxiu Qi, a lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University, was subject to racist tirade on Airbnb\n\nSimone Kyriakopoulou launched the vile racist rant against the host and submitted a wave of negative reviews as she checked out of the property\n\nThe Grade I listed property has been rented out on the platform by the super host platform for 11 years\nShe said the abuse has made her 'look at the world differently' and has made her 'fear she doesn't belong in the country anymore'.\nMs Kyriakopoulou, who previous hosts have accused of sending abusive messages, making up lies about their house, and urinating on their door, first left negative reviews complaining about the alleged cold temperature at the accommodation.\nIn the private feedback section, she then wrote: 'As much as you want to be European in Bath, you are a dictator from China.\n'You deserve yourself. A passport doesn't buy you a civilised background. You carry who you are and where you come from. Ok Chinese lady.'\nShe added: 'Baoxiu you are Chinese you are Asian. Your face, your body language, your background and the way you behave, everything is Chinese. I understand you had a bad background and a bad life and you need to get it out to people.\n'You know Bath is a Roman city and you pride yourself on being in Bath for 20 years. You are Chinese from Asia. Your passport won't buy you a new culture. England is Europe and Christian.'\nMs Qi, a Bath resident of 30 years, told the Daily Mail: 'When I first read the messages it was horrendous. My whole body went cold and I was shaking.\n'The next day I checked again and I saw another racist and abusive message. It's made me look at the world differently.\n'I've lived in Bath since I was 26 but it has made me look at people differently, it's made me think, \"Is this how people think of me?\"\n'I couldn't sleep afterwards for the first week. The financial loss is one thing but it's more the mental stress.\n\nMs Kyriakopoulou told Baoxiu she was a 'dictator from China' and that a 'passport doesn't buy you a civilised background'\n\nShe also told the Bath resident of 30 years that her 'passport won't buy a new culture. England is Europe and Christian' \n'I would prefer it if she had punched me. If it was physical then I could have recovered but this has changed the way I interact with others, it's made me question if I really belong here.\n'It's really horrible, it happened on December 17 but it still feels really hurtful. \n'I've been living here for 30 years, I've never experienced anything like that.'\nShe added: 'I think the financial loss is one thing, but another thing is the mental stress.\n'It really makes me feel like I just want to hide in some corner.'\nAirbnb says they 'prohibit users, including co-hosts and co-travellers, from discriminating against others on the basis of the following protected characteristics - including race, religion and nation of origin' and their 'nondiscrimination policy applies to all of Airbnb and all of its listings - homes, services and experiences'.\nDespite providing evidence of the racist abuse, they initially refused to remove the public reviews. \nThey said: 'After a thorough investigation, we have determined that the review must remain on your profile. Our review team found that the content of the review is relevant, as it directly described the guest's firsthand experience during their stay.\n'We appreciate that this many not be what you'd hoped for, but won't be able to offer additional support on this case at this time.\n'Generally we only remove reviews if they include prohibited speech, such as private information or hate speech - or if they are used as means of extortion.'\nAfter weeks of chasing Airbnb, where Ms Qi spoke to tens of representatives, they were eventually removed.\n\nMs Qi said she has never suffered such racism before and it has left her questioning her place in the country\n\nAirbnb refused to remove the negative reviews despite repeated attempts from the lecturer highlighting the racist abuse \nAnd they only removed Ms Kyriakopoulou, who has lodged multiple complaints about her former host, from the app, after being contacted by this newspaper.\nAirbnb said it blocked the guest from making reservations while their teams investigated the complaints. \nMs Qi said: 'I complained to AirBnb relentlessly. The comments have now been deleted but the damage has been done and people have seen them.\n'Yesterday I got a call from Hampton's estate agent who said some potential tenants asked about the issues as they spotted there was an alleged heating and water pressure issue.\n'The first comment was removed after 10 days - after I called them on a daily basis. It took another week to remove the second one - but only after phone calls and rejections.\n'I wanted them to remove the guest from their platform as she's clearly a racist.\n'At first they said they can't remove her but sent a warning.\nMs Qi said she has received no bookings since the reviews were published even though she used to have one every weekend.\n'It was doing well. I was getting about £4,000 a month, now I'm getting nothing,' she added.\n'I am disgusted and disheartened by the guest but Airbnb as well because how they've dealt with such a clear-cut attack on me.\n'It's such obvious racism and I kept being referred to another person and another person. That drove me crazy.\n'I spoke to countless people. I called twice a day. I was so stressed around Christmas time and it ruined the period.\n'I was really shocked because I called them straight away and this is such a clear case. I thought anybody who saw that message would say \"Oh my God, we're going to remove that immediately\". But that wasn't the case.'\nAn Airbnb spokesperson said: 'Discrimination has no place on Airbnb, and we take reports seriously.\n'As soon as we received this report, we suspended the guest and reached out to our host to provide support as we investigated. Following that investigation, we have removed the guest from the platform.'\nAirbnbChina\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nAirbnb 'refused to ban guest who racially abused host over temperature of flat' and instead suggested 'she post a response online'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 26\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

He added that the song is also for “the people of Minneapolis” and “our innocent immigrant neighbors.” Daily life for residents in the Minnesota city has been upended in the weeks since 3,000 federal agents flooded the streets for an immigration crackdown operation. The song, which is about four and a half minutes long, denounces U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and calls out Trump administration officials by name, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and President Donald Trump himself. \"Through the winter’s ice and cold/ Down Nicollet Avenue/ A city aflame fought fire and ice/ ‘Neath an occupier’s boots/ King Trump’s private army from the DHS/ Guns belted to their coats/ Came to Minneapolis to enforce the law/ Or so their story goes,\" Springsteen sings. The song later continues: “Their claim was self defense, sir/ Just don’t believe your eyes/ It’s our blood and bones/ And these whistles and phones/ Against Miller and Noem’s dirty lies.\" In a statement to NBC News, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, “The Trump Administration is focused on encouraging state and local Democrats to work with federal law enforcement officers on removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens from their communities — not random songs with irrelevant opinions and inaccurate information.\" A representative for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Springsteen has long been a vocal critic of Trump, endorsing then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election and telling The Atlantic in 2020 that the twice-impeached president was a “threat to our democracy.\" Last year, Springsteen opened his tour of the United Kingdom with stinging criticism of the Trump administration, accusing its officials of authoritarianism, rolling back civil rights and illegal deportations. He's also received backlash for his music's messaging before, having drawn criticism from police in 2000 after releasing \"American Skin (41 shots)\" about the killing of Amadou Diallo by four police officers. Since Pretti's death Saturday, several other stars across the music, film, television and sports worlds have been using their social media pages to post in solidarity with anti-ICE protesters in Minnesota. “ICEs actions are unconscionable but we are not powerless,” pop star Olivia Rodrigo, who previously slammed DHS for using her song “All-American Bitch,” wrote on her Instagram story. “Our actions matter. I stand with Minnesota.” Artist Katy Perry, who has 201 million Instagram followers, shared a series of posts encouraging people to call their senators, writing “because it’s time to turn anger into action.” Billie Eilish’s brother/collaborator Finneas, who has previously protested against ICE in Los Angeles, also spoke about the shootings in Minnesota in an Instagram post Sunday. “The conservative argument that allows school shootings to continue has always basically boiled down to ‘we have to protect the Second Amendment’ … every argument I’ve seen of why Alexander Pretti’s death was justified yesterday is like ‘well he had a gun.’ Shut the f— up,” he said in a video. “You spent 30 years telling us children have to die so we’re allowed to legally carry weapons everywhere in the United States….you didn’t draw his weapon. He had a weapon on him, legally.” Eilish later shared her brother’s post, and wrote in her own Instagram story: “hey my fellow celebrities u gonna speak up? or” Springsteen had previously responded to the events unfolding in Minneapolis during a performance at the Light of Day Winterfest concert in Red Bank, New Jersey. Before he played his hit “The Promised Land,” he dedicated the song to Good’s memory, according to cellphone video from the performance shared by NJ.com. In the video, Springsteen characterized federal law enforcement participating in the Trump administration’s crackdown as “heavily armed, masked federal troops invading an American city, using Gestapo tactics against their fellow citizens.” Springsteen also said he wrote the song “as an ode to American possibility” and added that the United States’ set of ideals and values is “being tested as it has never been in modern times.” He told the crowd he hoped his message would reach Trump. “If you believe you don’t deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president. And as the mayor of that city has said: ‘ICE should get the f--- out of Minneapolis,” Springsteen told a supportive home-state crowd, echoing the words of Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/bruce-springsteen-slams-ice-trump-new-song-minneapolis-rcna256358","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260118-bruce-springsteen-rc-1027p-6bb750.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 20:51:38","author":"Caroline Kenny","authors":["Caroline Kenny"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.183},{"id":397116808,"title":"Fain condemns killing of Alex Pretti: 'He was a fellow union member'","text":"United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain has condemned the killing of Alex Pretti — a U.S. citizen and union worker — during a protest against the deluge of immigration enforcement operations sweeping the country.\n\nPretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital, was shot and killed by border patrol agents on Saturday. He was the second U.S. citizen federal agents shot and killed during skirmishes among protesters and federal immigration agents in Minneapolis. In a statement released Jan. 28, Fain noted Pretti was a union member of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 3669.\n\n\"The UAW stands in solidarity with the family and loved ones of our fallen union brother Alex Pretti and all those standing up for justice in Minneapolis and beyond,\" Fain wrote, adding that Pretti was \"a fellow union member doing what UAW members do all the time — heeding a call for solidarity and exercising his Constitutional rights. For that, he was killed in the street.\"\n\nICE in Michigan: ICE 'targeted' Ypsilanti parents near bus stop, sheriff says\n\nBelvidere controversy: Local UAW president: Embattled Stellantis plant facing further delay\n\nIn the aftermath of Pretti's killing, the Department of Homeland Security and the Trump administration were quick to cast the shooting as an act of self-defense by the officers, with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem alleging that Pretti was brandishing a gun. Video accounts of the incident contradict the administration's narrative, showing Pretti holding only a cell phone while being tackled, sprayed with pepper spray, struck with the cannister and then disarmed by the federal officers before being shot. Pretti was a licensed gun owner.\n\n\"This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and kill law enforcement,\" Noem said in a news conference the day of the shooting.\n\nA New York Times breakdown of the footage indicates that Pretti was disarmed before he was shot at least 10 times.\n\nFain condemned the shooting and said suppression of protesters in the country demands action from labor organizations.\n\n\"The killing of peaceful protesters like Alex Pretti threatens our rights and our Constitution. In moments like these, the labor movement must not be silent,\" Fain said. \"Unions in Minnesota took action last Friday, January 23, by participating in a general strike and protested across the state. If the right to protest or speak freely is under attack, then our rights as workers are not safe. Our freedom to strike, or to walk a picket line to win a better life, may be threatened next.\"\n\nThe statement from Fain is another moment in which the labor leader has stood against the Trump administration. Fain notably supported selective tariffs on the automotive industry as a means to revitalize the American automotive manufacturing economy, which is a position long held by the UAW.\n\nFain has criticized Trump for his economic policy and stance on labor. In 2024, Fain stumped for then-Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris during the presidential election.\n\nLiam Rappleye covers Stellantis and the UAW for the Detroit Free Press.

Josh Shapiro, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, is criticizing former President Joe Biden and his administration for failing to deliver results for Americans. \"The Biden-Harris administration didn't provide those specific tangible things that people could see or feel,\" Shapiro said this week during an appearance on the \"Raging Moderates\" podcast that comes amid a slew of interviews the governor's giving as part of the rollout of his new memoir, \"Where We Keep the Light: Stories From a Life of Service.\" Shapiro, who is running for re-election this year in the crucial northeastern battleground state, has taken some jabs at Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, who may end up being a rival for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination. The governor, in his interview, gave what he called \"a very specific, concrete example\" of the Biden-Harris administration's failing optics. SHAPIRO REJECTS CLAIM HIS BOOK IS A RESPONSE TO KAMALA HARRIS CRITICISM \"One of the biggest things holding back our rural communities is a lack of high-speed, affordable internet,\" Shapiro said as he pointed to his home state. The governor added that he \"was incredibly proud of President Biden when they got that infrastructure bill passed to provide the billions of dollars that were needed to plug everybody in, connect everybody in Pennsylvania. But, he added, \"Do you know how many people ... this many years later, have been connected to high-speed affordable internet thanks to President Biden’s law in Pennsylvania? Zero. Because the dollars were never driven out.\" JOSH SHAPIRO ACCUSES HARRIS' VETTING TEAM OF MAKING DISRESPECTFUL COMMENTARY TOWARDS HIS WIFE Shapiro used the episode to contrast the former president's style of governing with his own. \"That broadband example is just one where I think there's a real difference in approach. I'm about concrete, get s--- done, show your work and not just talking about it,\" the governor added. Fox News Digital reached out to the former president's spokesperson for comment but hadn't received a response by the time this story published. But a longtime Democratic strategist and veteran of the Biden-Harris 2024 presidential campaign told Fox News Digital he found Shapiro's comments \"pretty weird and bizarre.\" \"Every Democrat, including Josh Shapiro, has a long record of praising and defending Joe Biden and the same legislation that Shapiro is now taking issue with,\" the strategist, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, said. Broadband funding for Pennsylvania was delayed in part due to federal rules changes, administrative bottlenecks and shifting technology focus. IT'S JANUARY 2026, BUT THE 2028 WHITE HOUSE RACE IS WELL UNDERWAY Shapiro, in his book, shared new details about briefly considering challenging Harris for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination after Biden dropped out of the race one month after a disastrous debate performance against President Donald Trump. But he wrote that he ultimately agreed with his wife that it wasn't the right time to seek the presidency. Shapiro was among a handful of top Democrats that Harris considered as a running mate before she chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The former vice president alleged in \"107 Days,\" her memoir published last year, that, during the running mate vetting process, Shapiro insisted on being \"in the room for every decision\" if he were to become vice president. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Shapiro in an interview late last year rejected her claims as \"bulls---\" and \"blatant lies.\" And Shapiro’s book includes critiques of Harris, including the accusation that, during the Harris team’s vice-presidential vetting process, Shapiro was asked if he had ever been an agent of the state of Israel.

Guess Who Gets the Money.","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nThe big question about President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace—which he formally announced while at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week—is whether it’s a scam, a delusion, or both.\n\nTrump first mentioned a Board of Peace in September during the signing of a ceasefire accord for Israel’s war in Gaza. The idea was that the board would be the forum where Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other Middle East countries discuss political reforms, reconstruction, and other issues relating to security and long-term peace in Gaza. Trump would chair the board—a role that he improbably insisted wasn’t his idea, but the plan made some sense, given that Trump played a major role in prodding the parties to sign the ceasefire.\n\nHowever, in the months since, Trump’s vision of the board has—like much else about his presidency—swelled with self-aggrandizement. The board’s charter—which he hasn’t publicized but which the Times of Israel obtained and published—doesn’t mention Gaza at all. Rather, the document states that the board will seek “to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”—seeming to indicate any sort of conflict, anywhere on earth.\n\nThe members on the board will consist of whichever heads of state the chairman, Donald Trump, chooses to invite. Their terms of membership will last three years, unless they pay the board $1 billion, which would buy them lifetime tenure. (Trump is designated as chairman for as long as he likes, certainly beyond the remaining three years of his presidency, gratis.)\n\nThe board will decide policies and declare resolutions by majority vote, but the chairman (read: Trump) gets veto power; he can also initiate measures unilaterally, eject members, and choose his own successor.\n\nIn other words, the Board of Peace marks yet another episode in Trump’s massive meandering ego trip. More than that, its charter, laid out in formal legalese, is sheer fantasy. It is no surprise that most of the heads of state whom he invited to join, notably those with proven interest in peace and “lawful governance,” have declined.\n\nThe naysayers include France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom—in short, many of our leading allies. Trump retracted his invitation to Canada after its prime minister, Mark Carney, delivered a much-lauded speech at Davos calling on middle-sized countries to avoid unfair pressures from larger powers by banding together. (Trump’s retraction, which he posted on social media, bolsters the impression that this is all about Trump, not world peace.)\n\nThose who have said they will join include Argentina, Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Egypt, El Salvador, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kosovo, Morocco, Mongolia, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. None of them are members of the U.N. Security Council (which Trump preposterously hopes to supplant), only a few practice “lawful governance,” and even fewer have any experience at seriously mediating conflict. It is not known whether any of them have been foolish enough to pony up the $1 billion initiation fee—nor has Trump or anyone else said who would control this slush fund. (Want to take a guess?)\n\nThe leaders of China, India, and Russia are among those who haven’t yet responded. This is no surprise. These are regional, aspiringly global powers who have a serious (if, in some cases, disruptive) interest in matters of war and peace. And they must know that Trump’s Board of Peace is not serious.\n\nIn his gushing invitation letter, Trump declared that his goal is to “bring together a distinguished group of nations ready to shoulder the noble responsibility of building LASTING PEACE.” In his snitty retraction letter to Prime Minister Carney, he brayed that Canada would thereby be excluded from “what will be the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled at any time.”\n\nIf Trump believes his own hype (always an uncertainty), he reveals here once again that he has no idea what peace, especially “LASTING PEACE,” requires. To the extent Trump currently has the power to elicit feigned respect and sometimes reluctant obedience from other world leaders, it’s because he is president of the United States—meaning that he can exert the tremendous leverage of the world’s main currency and most powerful military.\n\nOnce his term in the Oval Office ends in three years, no leader would have any reason to pay him the slightest attention or courtesy. No leaders embroiled in conflict would welcome the mediation of his so-called Board of Peace, much less follow its orders.\n\nMaybe some leaders would consent to a meeting if the board really were composed of “the most prestigious” peacemakers. But look at who, according to a statement from the White House, is on the group’s “founding” executive board: Trump’s globe-trotting emissary, Steve Witkoff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner (whose efforts to end Russia’s war on Ukraine have been especially aimless); Marc Rowan (a billionaire financier who has led Trump’s political pressure campaigns on American universities); Robert Gabriel (a former producer of Laura Ingraham’s TV show who is now Trump’s deputy national security adviser); Secretary of State Marco Rubio (whose influence will fade along with Trump’s at the end of this administration, at least if he remains under his post-presidential thumb); Sir Tony Blair (whose record as Britain’s prime minister still makes many in the Middle East shudder); and Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank.\n\nBanga is an interesting choice: He was nominated to the World Bank by President Joe Biden, he advised Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign, and he knows something about world politics. The others, once untethered from a sitting American president, would have no authority in making peace whatsoever.\n\nEven with the power of the White House and the imprimatur of a U.N. Security Council resolution, Trump’s current Board of Peace has been unable to make headway on molding long-term peace in Gaza, the one conflict it was created to help solve. (The Security Council limited the board’s authority solely to rebuilding Gaza and set it to expire at the end of 2027.) The idea that it can roam the globe on its own, ending wars with no base of power or authority, is risible.\n\nIf the next president is a Democrat, one of their first tasks will probably be to order the words “Donald J. Trump” to be removed from the august wall of the Kennedy Center. There will, however, be no need to worry about dismantling, or doing anything about, the Trump Board of Peace; it will quickly collapse of its own accord.","summary":"The leaders of China, India, and Russia are among those who haven’t yet responded.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/01/trump-peace-board-gaza-one-billion-dollars.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/17cec1a3-d985-4fd2-8074-cea41d462b3c.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 20:46:48","author":"Fred Kaplan","authors":["Fred Kaplan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.042},{"id":397114284,"title":"Rubio Lights Up Dems During Venezuela Hearing As Protester Goes Down to Brutal Defeat","text":"Secretary of State Marco Rubio certainly has shown how talented he is at the job. \n\nHe seems to have played a big part in a lot of the deals that the Trump team has pulled off. \n\nHe's also been very skilled at laying out the Trump agenda and showing its worth, including while testifying before Congress. \n\nRubio was testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday. He laid out the progress that had been happening in Venezuela because of the U.S. pressure. \n\nThis is competence: \n\nHe outlined the threat that there had been because of the involvement of our opponents in the South American country, and how much better off we are now. He showed how his job is supposed to be done. If you compare this to the prior Biden team's competence, or more exactly, the lack thereof, it's pretty stunning. \n\nWhile Rubio was at it, he ran rings around the Democrats, including giving quite a schooling to Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL). He was even complimented by his great friend, Vice President JD Vance, for how he dealt with her questions. \n\n\"Watching Tammy Duckworth obsessively interrupt Marco Rubio during this hearing is like watching Forest Gump argue with Isaac Newton!\" Vance said. That sounds about right. \n\nRubio also leveled Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI), who asked if we were going to promote regime change in Cuba. \n\nRubio pointed out how the Helms-Burton Act has codified that we're trying to promote a different form of government in Cuba. That's the purpose of the boycott we've had for decades. So Rubio can't commit to not doing what we've been doing for years, and that's required by the Act. \n\nThen there was this truly funny moment when a protester stood up with a sign and didn't even last fifteen seconds. Committee Chair Jim Risch (ID) delivered a great response. You can see Rubio grinning. \n\n\"Here we go! You know the drill. Off to jail!\" Risch said, explaining that protesters faced a one-year ban from the Committee for a first-time offense and a three-year ban if they were repeat offenders. Risch then joked with Rubio about the \"robust following\" he got out to protest him. Rubio joked back that he expected more. \n\nREAD MORE: Rubio Destroys the Dem Narrative on Venezuela, Mocks Kamala Harris in the Process\n\nRubio just makes the left look silly. \n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy RedState’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JASON CHESTER, ASSISTANT SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:17:01 GMT, 28 January 2026 |Updated:20:36 GMT, 28 January 2026 \n\nIt's only January, but 2026 is rapidly turning into a special year for Ellie Goulding. \nHaving already been made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to biodiversity and the climate, Goulding will welcome a second child - her first with boyfriend Beau Minniear - in May. \nThere's also the small matter of her sixth studio album, currently untitled and without an official release date - but fully mastered and underpinned with a very prominent theme. \nSpeaking to the latest issue of NYLON, Goulding confirmed the new long player is heavily influenced by her short-lived marriage to art dealer Caspar Jopling, the father of her eldest child - son Arthur, four. \n'It had always been the goal to start this album,' she said. 'I didn’t know it was going to be a divorce album, but that’s the way it started heading.' \nGoulding exchanged vows with Jopling, the Harvard educated grandson of Conservative MP Michael Jopling, Baron Jopling, at Grade I listed York Minster in 2019. \n\nPregnant Ellie Goulding has posed in her underwear for a new cover-shoot with the latest issue of NYLON magazine \n\nGoulding has confirmed her new album is heavily influenced by her short-lived marriage to art dealer Caspar Jopling, the father of her eldest child - son Arthur, four\n\nMotherhood appears to be front and centre in her new cover shoot for NYLON, a collaboration with New York based photographer César Buitrago \nThe singer gave birth to their only child together in 2021, three years before she and Joling confirmed the marriage was over - a difficult chapter that ultimately provided the creative spark she needed while writing her new music. \n'When I married my ex-husband, I thought it was for life. That will never go away,' she said. 'There are some songs that are necessary for me to acknowledge that time in my life and to be respectful of it. \n'Then there were some songs that were extremely reactionary and sad that I felt were good to do in the moment but don’t serve me long-term.'\nThe collapse of her marriage had already turned into a creative issue before she entered the studio, with Goulding forced to tell her producer about the separation on the very day she was introduced to him. \nShe recalled: 'I knew that my marriage wasn’t working out, it was dark times… the day I met Jack was the day I was like, \"Jack, I should be candid with you. Today, my husband and I decided we’re going to separate.\"'\nBut despite the unvarnished nature of her lyrics and their clear personal resonance, Goulding says Jopling remains fully supportive of the project - at least for the time being.\n'My label, my friends - everyone’s behind it,' she said. 'And even my ex-husband loves the songs… well, he hasn’t heard all the songs.'\nWith the album expected to go on general release before she gives birth, Goulding insists she's more than capable of managing her career while coping with the inevitable demands that come with a new baby. \n\nJoin the debate\nAre YOU a fan of Ellie Goulding?Comment now\n\nThe singer shows off her prominent baby bump in a black bra and open leather jacket in one image from the new cover shoot \n\nWith her new album expected to go on general release before she gives birth, Goulding insists she's capable of managing her career while coping with the demands that come with a baby\n\n'It’s a beautiful thing to be able to grow a child, and I feel very lucky that I’m healthy - but it’s not all I am right now,' she said\n\nGoulding will welcome her second child in May, but despite her pregnancy she insists she's 'still working every day and still writing every day' \n\nThe full interview is available to read in the latest issue of NYLON, out now\n'I didn’t want to become just a pregnant woman first,' she said. \n'Not every woman has this luxury. I have amazing people around me. I have an amazing boyfriend. I do have it a little easier in that I do have amazing support. I’m still working every day and still writing every day. \n'It’s just that I am growing a human inside me. I’m perhaps not the most, like, Mother Earth about it, if you know what I mean? \n'It’s a beautiful thing to be able to grow a child, and I feel very lucky that I’m healthy - but it’s not all I am right now.' \nRegardless, Motherhood appears to be front and centre in her new cover shoot, a collaboration with New York based photographer César Buitrago. \nIn one particularly striking image, the singer covers her baby bump in a T-shirt emblazoned with the single world 'Mother' while modelling a pair of skimpy black underwear. \nA second finds her exposing her torso in a black bralette and cropped leather jacket, while a third captures Goulding in a tiered cream blouse, her baby bump visible as she gazes out at the reader.\n\nThe singer says her ex-husband remains fully supportive of her new 'divorce' album - but admits he's yet to hear every song \n\n'My label, my friends - everyone’s behind it,' she said. 'And even my ex-husband loves the songs… well, he hasn’t heard all the songs'\n\nGoulding with current boyfriend Beau Minniear. The couple will welcome their first child together, Goulding's second, later this year\nBut if she's playing a role, it's not an intentional one, with Goulding adamant that her new music represents a significant departure from the artist she once was. \n'I am grateful that my label is very cooperative with me no longer wishing to play that character anymore,' she said. 'People don’t want fake. They don’t want characters. They don’t want somebody inauthentic.' \nShe added: '[The new music] was taking it back to basics for me, going back to instruments - which is so rudimental, but AI music is on the rise… I took it back to the guitar, which is where I first started.\n'It aroused something in me that was innocent and pure from when I was 15, writing my first song.'\nThe full interview is available to read in the latest issue of NYLON, out now. \nEllie Goulding\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nPregnant Ellie Goulding shows off her baby bump in underwear and 'mother' T-shirt for new NYLON cover shoot - as she reflects on the 'dark times' with ex-husband Caspar Jopling that led to her 'divorce album'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 174\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

I remember processing those photos I took of Rod [at his concert] and thinking, what a lovely memory and that was that.'\nHowever once Rod was ready he reached out and the pair began dating and Penny was welcomed into his blended family. \n\nPrior to welcoming two sons with Penny, Rod was already a father to six children from previous relationships. \nThe star put his first child up for adoption, Sarah, 62, who he welcomed with his ex-girlfriend Susannah Boffey when he was just 17, he later formed a relationship with her.\nHe then had daughter Kimberly, 46, and son Sean, 45, with his ex-wife Alana Stewart and a daughter Ruby, 38, with his ex-girlfriend Kelly Emberg.\nWhile married to his ex-wife Rachel Hunter, the Faces frontman had two more children, Renee, 33, and Liam, 31.\nWindsor CastleRod StewartPenny Lancaster\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRod Stewart, 81, and his wife Penny Lancaster, 54, put on a loved-up display as they attend the Finding Harmony: A King's Vision premiere\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

A course I set and I wasn't going to be diverted from.'\nAfter an academic commented that the world is not on the 'trajectory' needed to limit the worst effects of climate change, Charles remarked: 'It's rapidly going backwards, I've said that for the last 40 years, but anyway, there we are... I can only do what I can do, which is not very much - anyway.\n'People don't seem to understand it's not just climate that's the problem, it's also biodiversity loss, so we're actually destroying our means of survival, all the time.\n'To put that back together again is possible, but we should have been doing it long ago. We've got to do it as fast as we can now.'\n\nKing Charles photographed in the Arboretum at Highgrove House in July 2025, by portrait photographer Millie Pilkington, for Prime Video documentary Finding Harmony: A King's Vision\n\nMeryl Streep (centre) and Kate Winslet (third right) watch as King Charles speaks to guests during the King's Foundation Awards ceremony at St James's Palace, London\n\nHe added: 'Maybe, by the time I shuffle off this mortal coil, there might be a little more awareness... of the need to bring things back together again.'\nKate said: 'While explaining his passion for organic gardening to the press, Prince Charles made a comment that has haunted him ever since.'\nArchive footage of him describing how he talks to plants is included in the film.\nIan Skelly, co-author of the King's 2010 Harmony book, said: 'Those criticisms really upset him. He got treated very unfairly, seen very unfairly, and those of us that knew him better were quite upset by that.\n'It was difficult to know how to respond, but I really felt for him.'\nCharles said in 1986: 'I just come and talk to the plants, really - very important to talk to them, they respond.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKate Winslet puts on a glamorous display as she joins Benedict Cumberbatch and his wife Sophie Hunter at Finding Harmony: A King's Vision Windsor Castle premiere\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy CHRISTINE RENDÓN, US SENIOR REPORTER \n Published:18:00 GMT, 28 January 2026 |Updated:19:31 GMT, 28 January 2026 \n\nCharity Pierce, who appeared on the TLC show My 600-lb Life, has died at age 50 after reportedly suffering from various health ailments. \nPierce's daughter Charly Jo confirmed the passing, writing on her Facebook that her mother is now 'finally at peace.' \n'I wasn't going to post about this. But.. the calling and the texting is making my head feel like it's on fire,' she wrote. 'Almost all immediate family knows so, my mom passed away today. She's up with her momma and brother and sister and she's finally at peace. Charity fly high momma. I hope you know how much I love you and how grateful I was to be able to be by your side while you took your last breath.' \nPierce, who was once known as the 'world's fattest woman' after weighing in at 778 pounds, chronicled her efforts to lose weight on the TLC series, where she would ultimately drop 440 pounds. \nShe passed away with loved ones by her side at 1:20AM on Tuesday, a family source told TMZ.\nThe source said various medical conditions had resulted in Pierce being placed in hospice care for the past month or two. \n\nCharity Pierce, who appeared on an episode of the TLC show My 600-lb Life in 2015, has reportedly died at age 50\n\nDuring her weight loss journey, she would ultimately drop 440 pounds (pictured in a 2023 Facebook post with Dr Younan Nowzaradan)\nThe health issues included lymphedema and fluid buildup in her lungs, with the source saying the fluid was a possible factor in her death. A cause of death is not yet known. \n\n My 600-lb Life vet Amber Rachdi honors her late peers as she issues warning to judgmental viewers \nThe passing comes almost six years after Pierce revealed she had been diagnosed with kidney cancer.\n'I found out at Christmas time that I have kidney cancer,' she posted to her Facebook in in March 2020. 'It devastated me bc my mom passed away from brain cancer. So since Christmas I’ve had high anxiety and lots of panic attacks. After lots of testing and a million doctor appointments they figured out the cancer was only in my kidney. The next step was to get my kidney removed as soon as possible before it had a chance to spread to other organs in my body. So on March 2 my kidney was removed. And now I’m recovering at home trying to heal. I just hope the future has something good in store.'\nPierce was first featured on My 600-Lb Life in 2015 followed by appearances in the follow-up show, My 600-Lb Life: Where Are They Now?\nIn 2014, a housebound Pierce was determined to have her story filmed by TLC as she was convinced it was the only way to save her life - and felt filming the show would motivate her to lose enough weight to be able to travel and see her mother, who was dying of brain cancer.\nAt the time, although she was almost 200lb (14st 3lb) over the recommended weight for gastric surgery, Houston-based surgeon Dr Younan Nowzaradan took her on, helping her get down to 650lb (46st) over five months, so that he could put her through the procedure that would shrink her stomach to the size of a baseball.\nBut sadly, the operation came too late for Pierce - who lived with daughter Charly and then- fiance Tony Sauer - to see her mother, who died while she was recovering from surgery.\nYet she faced further procedures to tackle her ongoing health problems, which were caused by an addiction to food that was sparked by seeing her brutal father beat her mother.\n\nIn 2014 Pierce, who was housebound, was determined to have her story filmed by TLC as she was convinced it was the only way to save her life\nIn addition to her gastric surgeries, Pierce also had to undergo an operation to remove the large masses of fatty deposits on her legs which weighed 57lbs (4st) on their own.\nShe almost died after going under the knife again to have 38lbs of excess skin removed more than a year later and the wound became infected. Pierce was rushed back into hospital in danger of going into septic shock.\nShe appeared on TLC two years later alongside her daughter Charly on TLC's My 600lb Life; Where Are They Now?, where Pierce expressed concerns her daughter had picked up her same unhealthy eating habits. \nBut they ultimately managed to turn their lives around, with the pair revealing in the catch-up episode that therapy played a huge part in their new lifestyle, allowing them to address the psychological aspects of their dangerous dependency on food for emotional support.\n\nPierce felt filming the show would motivate her to lose enough weight to be able to travel and see her mother, who was dying of brain cancer\nThe mother and daughter duo also explained how they cooked healthy meals and food shopped together.\nThe pair's lifestyle turnaround came two years after Pierce's first surgery, and she was proud to reveal that she had lost a whopping 440lbs in that time, thanks to the numerous procedures she had undergone - and her ongoing healthy lifestyle.\nIndeed, Pierce had been through a remarkable transformation since her first appearance on the show back in April 2014, when she pleaded with producers to let her feature, having become convinced that it was the only way to save her life.\nAs the fattest woman in the world, with a developed a medical condition called lymphedema, which caused a huge swelling on her left leg, Pierce couldn't fit into a car, and was desperate to crowdfund the $5,000 to pay for a private ambulance to drive her to the weight-loss hospital in Texas where Dr. Nowzaradan is based.\nShe wrote on her Go Fund Me Page at the time: 'A doctor in Texas willing to do patients over 600lbs [is] my only hope.\n'The one thing that's going to save my life is gastric bypass. But I'm a single mother on disability with no one to count on besides myself.'\n\nPierce had undergone a massive transformation with her results visible on the follow-up show, TLC's My 600lb Life; Where Are They Now? \nPierce hoped that Dr. Nowzaradan would be able to get her healthy enough to see her ailing mother before she passed away, and she knew that losing a huge chunk of weight would be the only way she would live to see daughter Charly grow up, and make it to her dream wedding to Tony, her boyfriend who is 17 years her junior and served as her carer for much of their relationship.\nPierce told Best magazine that she was determined not to have to get married at home, adding: 'I want to be able to walk up the aisle.'\nWhile she was obese for several years, her weight problems became worse after she developed lymphedema, which blocks the lymphatic system and caused painful swelling in her legs, which made it almost impossible for Charity to walk.\n'The lymphedema feels like another whole person. It feels like cinder blocks hanging off you all the time,' she said at the time.\nThe swelling that protruded out the side of her leg also meant that exercise was totally out of the question, leaving Charity with little opportunity to even try and get fit and healthy.\nShe first turned to TV show doctors for help in 2012, when she released a video on YouTube pleading for someone to get her case to Dr Phil.\nShe explained in the clip that she first developed lymphedema in 2001 after falling down a flight of stairs, and then had to fight off flesh eating bacteria, necrotising fascitis in her abdomen.\n'They had to cut out 40lb of dead muscle and tissue. My left side looks as though a shark took a big bite out of it,' said Charity.\n'It's a very long road, but I'm going to get there,' she said.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nMy 600-lb Life star Charity Pierce who was once known as 'world's fattest woman' dead at age 50\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Democrats are rejecting it","text":"The undercounts disproportionately affected Republican strongholds, while the overcounts disproportionately cut in favor of blue states. When Texas moved forward with its unusual and controversial 2025 mid-decade redistricting plan at the behest of President Donald Trump, its goal was to net roughly five GOP-leaning seats in the House of Representatives. This would, on the low end, rectify the Census Bureau’s costly and consequential errors that redounded to Democrats’ advantage in multiple election cycles. Democrats who squealed with outrage when Texas Republicans undertook this maneuver never mentioned the half a dozen or so “free” seats they’ve been gifted by bureaucratic incompetence or malfeasance. In light of that extraordinary failure, Texas’s moves were defensible, in the name of any number of “democracy”-related slogans recently fashionable on the Left.\n\nEnter California. With Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D-CA) eyes set on higher political ambitions, he took it upon himself to retaliate against Texas, leading an expensive campaign to change the state’s constitution to gerrymander multiple Republicans out of their seats in the Golden State. This was framed as an act of principle, necessitated by Texas’s rogue actions. Never mind that California was already far more gerrymandered than Texas, based on proportionality, despite having an ostensibly independent commission responsible for drawing its map. The GOP generally pulls around 40% of the statewide vote in California, yet the commission’s map before Newsom’s redraw yielded just nine of 52 House seats in the red column — just 17% of the delegation. Now that California Democrats have strong-armed their way back into controlling the process, their new map will become even less representative. For “democracy.”\n\nCynical and hypocritical as California’s actions may be, they’re at least politically understandable and defensible, particularly by leaving out some of the nuance and context mentioned above. “Texas started it because Trump told them to, so we had to even the playing field,” is a simple, if simplistically misleading, mantra. It worked, and Democrats appear to have restored the tainted status quo nationally. Sabers have continued to rattle. With the specter of a possible all-out redistricting war looming, some other Republican states have considered additional changes. The New York Times recently admitted that such a nationwide battle would likely go poorly for Democrats, noting that “the toolbox for Democrats is relatively sparse,” in part because a number of heavily blue states are “already gerrymandered heavily in their favor,” so “squeezing more Democratic seats out of those states would be a challenge.”\n\nOn the other side of the ledger, Ohio Republicans ultimately backed off a more aggressive redistricting plan to cut a deal with Democrats, and Indiana Senate Republicans famously rebuffed intense White House pressure by decisively rejecting a partisan redraw of their own lines. This was done in the name of preserving norms, offering an off-ramp to the threatened one-upsmanship spiral. Democrats cheered, of course, and mouthed their usual “democracy” bromides. Then they moved to intensify the fight anyway. Rather than following the Hoosiers’ lead toward de-escalation, Virginia and Maryland Democrats are sprinting toward dramatic escalation. In the Old Dominion, newly empowered Democrats, who have introduced a raft of massive tax hikes and radical social policies, swiftly rammed through a scheme to shift the commonwealth’s congressional map from six Democrats and five Republicans to a lopsided 10-1 blowout. For reference, 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris won just under 52% of Virginia’s statewide vote.\n\nIn pushing this whiplash-inducing plan to a popular referendum, Democrats are asking voters to reverse their own 2020 anti-gerrymandering amendment, which passed with roughly two-thirds of the vote. Speaking of whiplash, freshly minted Gov. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA), a supposed centrist whose party appears eager to institute sweeping Californication, has blessed the power grab attempt. She’s done so by predictably blaming Republicans and wrapping herself in the banner of “democracy.” Spanberger is so passionate about democracy and norms that this is what she said about gerrymandering in 2019: “Gerrymandering is detrimental to our democracy, and it weakens the individual voices that form our electorates. Opposing gerrymandering should be a bipartisan priority.” Is that so, Abigail?\n\nIn nearby Maryland, already one of the most egregiously gerrymandered states in the nation, Democrats are attempting to push their delegation to 8-0, up from 7-1. Gov. Wes Moore (D-MD), like the other two governors mentioned previously, is said to harbor presidential aspirations. He supports the plan, which senior Democrats say is designed to “meet the moment” against alleged Republican overreach.\n\nSee how this works? The Texas GOP moved to ameliorate the Census debacle, and Democrats have since embarked upon an escalatory spree, as if they’re the victims. Indiana’s Republican Senate majority drew hackles from their own party’s president and their base by resisting agitations to push the tit-for-tat spat any further. They’ve been rewarded by many of the people who cheered them on, now rushing headlong down their own power-hungry path.\n\nNot everyone on Team Blue is convinced this is the prudent move, but they’re being excoriated from within. Amid some apparent misgivings from people such as Virginia’s two senators, both Democrats, here’s how a senior Richmond lawmaker in their own party publicly responded: “I have the utmost respect for Senator Kaine and Senator Warner but we do not need ‘coaching’ on redistricting coming from a cuck chair in the corner. How about you all stay focused on the fascist in the White House and let us handle redistricting in Virginia.” The cuck chair. “Fascist in the White House.” She tacked on a final message of “10-1,” referencing Democrats’ full-speed-ahead approach. Cooler heads prevailed in Indiana, shutting down a possible Republican advantage. Democratic hotheads appear to be emboldened by that climbdown.\n\nIf those hotheads prevail, Republicans must take off the gloves. If Democrats make the decision that their unfair Census Bureau-furnished advantage is their birthright and that Texas justifies a chain reaction of leftist power-grabs, the GOP will have no choice but to deliver the rout that even left-leaning analysts warn is possible if red states go full throttle. The Democratic hotheads should be forewarned, too, that their designs could be crushed even further after 2030, assuming the Census Bureau gets its act together. Why? I’ll let Barack Obama’s electoral guru, David Plouffe, explain.\n\nTRUMP’S BOUNCE AMONG HISPANICS COULD BENEFIT HIM IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS\n\n“Right now, Democrats have no credible path to sustained control of the Senate and the White House,” Plouffe wrote in an op-ed. “After the adjustments to the Electoral College map that look likely to come with the next census, the Democratic presidential nominee could win all the states won by Kamala Harris plus the blue wall of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and still fall short of the 270 electoral votes needed to win. An already unforgiving map becomes more so. This is equally true of the Senate.”\n\nNothing is permanent in politics, and that assessment may prove overly pessimistic, but he’s right that red states will almost certainly gain seats and electoral votes, as they should have in 2020, in the next census. Governing failures have driven people away from Democrat-dominated places, so this is a looming political crisis of their party’s own making. Should they press their advantage, which currently looks like little more than an advantage of willpower and ruthlessness, Republicans may decide to go for the jugular. On that note, I’ll leave you with this legislation, filed in response to a New York Democratic congresswoman welcoming the illegal immigration crisis to her community because “I need more people in my district just for redistricting purposes.”","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

Only 18 percent of voters who supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in the last presidential election supported U.S. military action against Iran, according to the poll, which was conducted by Public First.\n\nBut not all of Trump’s potential targets are appealing for Republican voters.\n\nSupport for using force against Greenland — a target that Trump has at times suggested could be acquired by the United States using military might — is much lower. Only 21 percent of Trump 2024 voters and 26 percent of self-identified “MAGA Republican” Trump voters backed the idea. (The poll was conducted Jan. 16 to 19, after Trump had significantly ratcheted up his rhetoric around Greenland but before he said he would take military action off the table during a Jan. 21 speech in Davos, Switzerland.)\n\nStill, that means that more than one in four of Trump’s most ardent supporters would encourage him to potentially attack a NATO ally to achieve what he views as America’s strategic needs. After publicly toying with the idea of invading the Arctic island, Trump backed down from those threats last week.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/28/trump-is-threatening-strike-iran-his-supporters-wouldnt-mind-00752821","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/e1cd08d/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fbc%2F96%2Feb4066e749d08a4cbbff5cc06800%2Ftpp-venezuela.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 19:00:00","author":"Giselle Ruhiyyih Ewing,Leo Shane Iii","authors":["Giselle Ruhiyyih Ewing","Leo Shane Iii"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.314},{"id":397076106,"title":"Republicans Admit Just How Much They Blow on Hair and Makeup","text":"The Republican National Committee dedicated a chunk of the budget to getting its people camera-ready last year. \n\nCampaign finance records, first reported by NOTUS, revealed how much money the RNC spent between April and November 2025 on what they billed as “media preparation.” \n\nNOTUS reported that between April and November of 2025, the RNC spent more than $59,000 on a pair of makeup artists.\n\nThe majority of that money—$53,850—was paid to hair and makeup artist Brittany Goetz, who most recently worked at Fox News and began contracting with the RNC this summer. The Federal Election Commission filings from the RNC did not detail exactly which services Goetz provided. \n\nGoetz’s social media accounts, which are now defunct, had shown she had done work for Karoline Leavitt, 28. \n\nA few thousand dollars were also sent to Washington, D.C.-based makeup artist Carola Myers. \n\nHer Instagram shows she has done makeup for figures across the political spectrum, including former President Joe Biden, former Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and the formerly engaged couple Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle. \n\nIt is not illegal or uncommon for campaigns and political parties to spend money on hair and makeup. NOTUS reported that the DNC paid one makeup artist who worked with former Vice President Kamala Harris $10,900. “In Trump land, as we all know, they all wear about a ton of makeup,” Meredith McGehee, a lobbying and ethics expert, told NOTUS.\n\nTrump, 79, himself is a leading example of the trend. He has been repeatedly spotted slathering on poorly color-matched concealer onto his bruised hands. \n\nThe makeup mishap has been the subject of intense scrutiny, including mockery by late-night show host Jimmy Kimmel. Hand makeup is a newer addition to the president’s longtime practice of sporting a coiffed hairstyle and tan, orange-toned face makeup. \n\nThe RNC and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \n\nThe RNC spending comes as the public is already beginning to take notice of what has become known as “Republican makeup.” The “Republican makeup” look typically features thick or cakey foundation, smoky eyeshadow, heavy mascara, overlined lips, and sharp, filled-in brows. \n\nThe online “Republican makeup” trend started with liberal online personality Suzanne Lambert, who posted a video where she pointed out a pattern she noticed among conservative women leaving hate comments on her videos.\n\n“I noticed that all of the Republican girlies in my comments do their makeup the exact same, gorgeous way, so I thought that I would try to do it myself,” Suzanne said in a video she posted in 2024, which has since received more than 4.7 million views.\n\n“We really want our makeup to cling to any dry spots and accentuate any texture,” she continued, adding, “we want to make sure it looks like we’ve never used moisturizer once in our life.”\n\nThe “Mar-a-Lago face\" is a separate, but common facial aesthetic among MAGA figures, for both men and women. The look typically includes cheeks with a large amount of cosmetic filler, very pronounced lips, and, for women, a full face of makeup. The effect is often an overly exaggerated visage with high-contrast facial features. \n\nLeavitt notably underwent a MAGA makeover since assuming her role as Trump’s top spokesperson. In her White House press briefings, she is seen wearing heavy makeup with pronounced lips, but she has not confirmed whether she has undergone any cosmetic procedures. \n\nA photograph by Christopher Anderson for Vanity Fair may offer the closest look at Leavitt’s MAGA makeover, in which lip injection sites appear visible.","summary":"Anna Moneymaker / Getty ImagesThe Republican National Committee dedicated a chunk of the budget to getting its people camera-ready last year. \n\nCampaign finance records, first reported by NOTUS, revealed how much money the RNC spent between April and November 2025 on what they billed as “media preparation.” \n\nThe disclosure comes amid increased scrutiny given to the appearance of key figures in the Republican Party.

I was thrust into this mad life, and that happened in a few months. It was the wildest time of my life.\n'It was impossible. I went straight from that to going on tour with Little Boots, then Katy Perry, then Bruno Mars. \n'My body wasn't catching up with my head, or maybe the other way around. I started getting panic attacks, to the point where I couldn’t leave the house. \n'I'd get in the car and the landscapes were triggering me, so I'd have to cover my face.'\n2026 is already proving to be a huge year for Ellie, having already been made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to biodiversity and the climate.\nShe will also welcome a second child - her first with boyfriend Beau - in May. \nThere's also the small matter of her sixth studio album, currently untitled and without an official release date - but fully mastered and underpinned with a very prominent theme. \n\nIn a new interview, Ellie has revealed she struggled to cope with the fame and started having panic attacks\n\nEllie has now admitted the whiplash of going from being an unknown writer to a double BRIT Award winner was overwhelming (Seen at the BRITs in 2010)\nEllie revealed her pregnancy as she walked the red carpet heavily pregnant at the Fashion Awards in early December. \nShe split from her husband Caspar Jopling, with whom she shares a four-year-old son, Arthur, in February 2024. \nSince her relationship with Beau went public in September 2025, the pair have holidayed together in Italy, where Beau shared online an intimate photograph of Ellie lying in an unmade hotel room bed.\nHe also appears in several raunchy scenes in Ellie's latest music video, Destiny.\nEarlier this month, Ellie revealed that she's dated women in between her 'toxic, fleeting and passionate' relationships with men in a candid confession about her love life.\nShe made the comments during an appearance on Sports Illustrated model Brooks Nader's reality show Love Thy Nader. \nThe pals, who shared a playful kiss back in 2024, were discussing relationships in scenes filmed last summer, when Brooks, 28, newly-single following her split from Dancing with the Stars pro Gleb Savchenko, joked about potentially dating women.\n'Maybe I'll go the other way,' the model said, to which Ellie responded: 'That's what I do. It works every time.'\n\nEllie with current boyfriend Beau Minniear in January. The couple will welcome their first child together, her second, later this year\n\nEllie, who already shares son Alfred, four, with ex-husband Caspar, then went on to share her frank views on romance.\n'I think the most exciting love comes for a reason, and it's toxic and fleeting and passionate and it's amazing and you're just like, \"no one else has ever experienced love like this\".\n'It's all great song material, to be honest. Annoyingly, I do it for the plot so that I can write a song about it.'\nEllie, whose sixth studio album is due to be released in the next few months, added: 'We should just appreciate it as the moment that it is, and then when it goes away, be appreciative that it's happened and that we got to experience it.\n'It's all about being the amazing woman that you are and then guys are just an accessory every now and again.'\nThe comments were filmed shortly before she was linked to actor Beau last July, but aired recently on the show.\nThe full interview is available to read in the latest issue of NYLON, out now.\nEllie GouldingBBCKaty Perry\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nEllie Goulding reveals she 'couldn't leave the house' due to crippling panic attacks as she struggled with her sudden rise to fame\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

It’s dedicated to the people of Minneapolis, our innocent immigrant neighbors and in memory of Alex Pretti and Renee Good.” \n\nAlex Pretti, 37, was shot and killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers during a protest in Minneapolis Saturday. \n\nRenee Good, also 37, was shot and killed by ICE officers during an encounter on a suburban street Jan. 7. \n\n“Streets of Minneapolis,” advances Springsteen’s ongoing criticisms of President Donald Trump. In the song, he sings “King Trump’s private army from the DHS / Guns belted to their coats / Came to Minneapolis to enforce the law / Or so their story goes.” \n\nThe song goes on to refer to ICE officers as “Trump’s federal thugs.” \n\nHe also denounces U.S. Homeland and Security Advisor Stephen Miller and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, singing: “It’s our blood and bones / And these whistles and phones / Against Miller and Noem’s dirty lies.” \n\nSpringsteen, 76, names both Pretti and Good in the song, noting over heartland guitars and harmonica “We’ll remember the names of those who died / On the streets of Minneapolis.” \n\nThe song’s political spirit channels the protest songs of Pete Seeger, a guiding light for Springsteen, who released his “Seeger Sessions” album in 2006 honoring the folk icon. \n\nThough this new song is easily the most direct political disapproval of his career, and the most overt condemnation of ICE operations in Minneapolis put forth by a major artist so far. \n\n“Streets of Minneapolis,” which shares no relation to Springsteen’s Oscar-winning 1994 song “Streets of Philadelphia,” follows Springsteen’s anti-ICE speech at the Count Basie Center for the Arts in Red Bank Jan. 17. During a surprise performance, Springsteen paused to address the crowd: \n\n“If you believe in democracy, in liberty, if you believe that truth still matters, that it’s worth speaking out, that it is worth fighting for, if you believe in the power of the law and no one stands above it, if you stand against heavily armed masked federal troops invading American cities and using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens, if you believe you don’t deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president, and as the mayor of that city has said, ‘ICE should get the f--- out of Minneapolis,’” Springsteen said, to roar from the audience of about 1,500.\n\nHe then dedicated “The Promised Land” to “mother of three and American citizen” Renee Good. \n\nSpringsteen, who performed in support of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in 2024 and performed at President Joe Biden’s inaugural celebration in 2021, has been at odds with Trump since his first campaign in 2016. \n\nSpringsteen and Trump’s most recent dust-up came in 2025 when Springsteen called Trump “incompetent and treasonous” during a Manchester, England concert. Trump fired back on Truth Social, saying Springsteen was “dumb as a rock,” and a “dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker.” \n\n“I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States,” Trump wrote. ”Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy — Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK.\"\n\nSee the song’s full lyrics below: \n\nThrough the winter’s ice and cold / Down Nicollet Avenue\n\nA city aflame fought fire and ice‘/ Neath an occupier’s boots\n\nKing Trump’s private army from the DHS/ Guns belted to their coats\n\nCame to Minneapolis to enforce the law / Or so their story goes\n\nAgainst smoke and rubber bullets / In the dawn’s early light\n\nCitizens stood for justice / Their voices ringing through the night\n\nAnd there were bloody footprints / Where mercy should have stood\n\nAnd two dead left to die on snow-filled streets / Alex Pretti and Renee Good\n\nOh our Minneapolis, I hear your voice / Singing through the bloody mist\n\nWe’ll take our stand for this land / And the stranger in our midst\n\nHere in our home they killed and roamed / In the winter of ’26\n\nWe’ll remember the names of those who died / On the streets of Minneapolis\n\nTrump’s federal thugs beat up on / His face and his chest \n\nThen we heard the gunshots / And Alex Pretti lay in the snow, dead \n\nTheir claim was self defense, sir / Just don’t believe your eyes\n\nIt’s our blood and bones / And these whistles and phones / Against Miller and Noem’s dirty lies\n\nOh our Minneapolis, I hear your voice / Crying through the bloody mist\n\nWe’ll remember the names of those who died / On the streets of Minneapolis\n\nNow they say they’re here to uphold the law / But they trample on our rights \n\nIf your skin is black or brown my friend/ You can be questioned or deported on sight \n\nIn chants of ICE out now / Our city’s heart and soul persists\n\nThrough broken glass and bloody tears / On the streets of Minneapolis\n\nOh our Minneapolis, I hear your voice / Singing through the bloody mist\n\nHere in our home they killed and roamed / In the winter of ’26\n\nWe’ll take our stand for this land / And the stranger in our midst\n\nWe’ll remember the names of those who died / On the streets of Minneapolis\n\nWe’ll remember the names of those who died / On the streets of Minneapolis","summary":"The song follows Springsteen's comments demanding ICE's removal from Minneapolis","url":"https://www.nj.com/entertainment/2026/01/springsteen-drops-new-anti-ice-protest-song-blasting-trump-honors-renee-good-and-alex-pretti.html","image":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/SMGZE7LLTZE5XJC2ICZORQM5A4.png?auth=9f1dcdb1cdb5c4cb9eba884373239f4c4103c08c6a79752d8d1063499842175d&width=1280&smart=true&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 18:40:47","author":"Bobby Olivier","authors":["Bobby Olivier"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.124},{"id":397090122,"title":"With the Midterms Looming, Trump Keeps Pushing for His Republican Critics to Lose Their Seats","text":"Sen. Susan Collins (and Sens. Lisa Murkowski, Rand Paul, Josh Hawley, and Todd Young)\n\nEarlier this month, five Republican senators broke with their party and joined Democrats in voting to advance legislation that would rein in the President’s authority to pursue military actions in Venezuela going forward, similar to the measure Massie later backed in the House. Trump quickly rebuked the lawmakers: Maine Sen. Susan Collins, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, and Indiana Sen. Todd Young.\n\n“Republicans should be ashamed of the Senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our Powers to fight and defend the United States of America,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Jan. 8. “Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Rand Paul, Josh Hawley, and Todd Young should never be elected to office again.”\n\nOf those five senators, only Collins is up for re-election in this year’s midterms. And the race for her seat is set to be close, and potentially a key contest in the battle for Senate control. Maine, which former Vice President Kamala Harris won in the 2024 election, is considered to be Democrats’ most feasible chance to gain a Senate seat.","summary":"The President has blasted several Republicans who are up for re-election this year and endorsed their primary opponents.","url":"https://time.com/7358546/trump-midterms-republicans-primaries/","image":"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Trump-Midterms-Republican-Critics.jpg?w=1200&h=675","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 18:32:35","author":"Chantelle Lee","authors":["Chantelle Lee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.035},{"id":397116584,"title":"Why Alex Pretti's killing broke Trump’s misinformation machine","text":"President Donald Trump’s authoritarian campaign to terrorize immigrants—designed and driven by Homeland Security adviser Stephen Miller—has been defined by cruelty from the start. \n\nFamilies have been ripped apart without notice.

The images have violated core American values of fairness, decency, and equal justice under the law, and public support for Trump’s immigration agenda has collapsed as a result. Policies once considered untouchable are now radioactive. Calls to abolish ICE—previously dismissed as fringe—now draw plurality support in multiple polls.\n\nRelated | Media falls for Trump's supposed ‘tone’ switch on Minneapolis\n\nAnd yet, it wasn’t until after the cold-blooded killing of Alex Pretti last Saturday that Trump began to soften his rhetoric. That shift does not reflect a moral awakening or a substantive change in policy. The administration’s xenophobic project remains fully intact. But Trump is clearly reacting to a loss of narrative control, scrambling to limit the political damage.\n\nSo what changed?\n\nIt wasn’t the kidnapping of five-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos.\n\nHe is a brown child. And conservatives have demonstrated, repeatedly, that once children are born—especially children like him—their lives carry little political weight. School shootings barely register. Family separation is dismissed as a bureaucratic inconvenience.\n\nIt wasn’t the execution of Renee Good.\n\nShe was a woman. She was a lesbian. The right barely bothered to mask its contempt, offering ideological justifications for her death that relied on long-standing hatreds.\n\nIt wasn’t the mass disappearances of Latino men carried off by masked agents, or the killing of Keith Porter Jr. by an off-duty ICE agent. For this movement, Black and brown victims are easy to dismiss—stripped of individuality, blamed for their own deaths, and denied even the presumption of innocence.\n\nWhat changed is that Alex Pretti looked like them.\n\nHe was white. He was male. He owned a gun. He worked as an ICU nurse helping veterans. He fit comfortably inside the cultural boundaries conservatives instinctively protect.\n\nThat made him difficult to erase. Some right-wing influencers tried, frantically digging through his political donation history to label him a liberal—as if that were a revelation. It wasn’t. \n\nAnd in any case, he died doing something unmistakably humane: protesting injustice and coming to the aid of a woman who had been assaulted by armed, uniformed men operating above the law. Where other victims were dismissed, rationalized away, or blamed for their own deaths, Pretti broke the script.\n\nThat is what made his sacrifice so disruptive—not because his life mattered more, but because his identity made denial harder. The deaths of Good, Ramos, Porter, and dozens of others were no less tragic, no less unjust, no less deserving of outrage. But Pretti exposed the lie at the heart of Trump’s propaganda: that this violence was targeted, controlled, and righteous. \n\nHis death made clear that the machinery of state brutality was not staying neatly confined to its intended victims, and that compliance offered no protection from a system built on brutality and subjugation rather than law.\n\nPretti did not have to be there. ICE’s abuses were not aimed at him. Only 38% of white men voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024. He stood apart from many of his demographic peers because he made a choice most do not: solidarity over safety, conscience over comfort.\n\nHis loss is immeasurable. It is also the moment that cracked the narrative armor protecting Trump’s immigration campaign, forcing a public reckoning that a year of evidence alone had failed to trigger.\n\nSomeday, Minneapolis will mark the Battle of Minneapolis with a memorial honoring those who waged fierce resistance against an occupying army, and those who paid with their lives to expose the truth. That monument will stand not just for Pretti, but for every victim whose humanity was denied until it became politically inconvenient to ignore.","summary":"President Donald Trump’s authoritarian campaign to terrorize immigrants—designed and driven by Homeland Security adviser Stephen Miller—has been defined by cruelty from the start. \n\n\n\nFamilies have been ripped apart without notice.

He was crowned National Schools boxing champion aged just 14.\nHe went on to represent his country at the European tournament, before working as a coach at his boyhood club, the Pat Benson Boxing Academy. \nThe athlete appeared in Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday, after he was charged on Saturday with two counts of conspiracy to assault occasioning bodily harm.\n\nRegan (pictured when younger), who is a second-year sport and exercise science student at Canterbury Christ Church University in Kent, was crowned National Schools boxing champion aged just 14\n\nThe athlete (left) appeared in Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday, after he was charged on Saturday with two counts of conspiracy to assault occasioning bodily harm\n\nMr Akbar (pictured) is a human rights lawyer and former Pakistani government adviser, who served in the country's cabinet under its jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan \n\nMeanwhile, Mr Raja (pictured) is an outspoken critic of the Pakistani government and has written about the alleged corruption of the country's military \nHe was remanded in custody ahead of a hearing at London's Old Bailey on February 13.\nProsecutor Warren Stanier explained: 'When Mr Akbar confirmed he was the person, he was then assaulted, punched numerous times to the face, causing him bruising, cuts and a broken nose.'\nHe continued: 'A group attended Mr Raja's address at 8am, but Mr Raja wasn't in.'\nThis came after several reconnaissance trips to the pair's houses, the lawyer added.\nRegan helped run boxing programmes for local students and was involved in a half-term project in collaboration with the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner.\nHe is now understood to live and work in Dubai, as a 'qualified England boxing coach' and 'personal trainer', according to his social media.\nThe boxer will be joined at the Old Bailey next month by co-defendants Karl Blackbird, 40, Clark McAulay, 39, and Doneto Brammer, 21.\nAll three men, who are British nationals, were charged on Friday and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Saturday, where they were remanded in custody.\nBlackbird, from Bedworth, Warwickshire, has been accused of two charges of conspiracy to assault occasioning bodily harm for both attacks.\nMcAulay, from Coventry, West Midlands, has been charged with conspiracy to assault occasioning bodily harm over the hit on Mr Raja.\nBrammer, from Wood Green, north London, has been accused over a second incident on New Year's Eve of the same year, which saw an attempt to set Mr Akbar's house on fire.\nTwo men are believed to have attacked the property while no one was home, with one using a firearm to break a window before one tried to throw a burning rag through it.\nThe material fell to the ground outside the property and did not cause any damage.\nBrammer is charged with possession of a prohibited weapon, conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life, and conspiracy to commit arson being reckless as to whether life would be endangered.\nA man, 34, was also arrested at an address in Great Dunmow, Essex, over the incident on January 5.

He argues that these killings, alongside ICE’s warrantless home raids and mistaken detentions, and the reports of deaths in custody, are not isolated abuses but signs of a rapidly deepening crisis in American democracy, one in which basic rights and due process are applied unevenly and increasingly contested. David asks whether the country can find a way back from a dangerous moral and political impasse, as a majority of Americans recoil from these actions while a determined minority continue to defend them.\n\nThen, David is joined by the New York Times columnist and Atlantic contributor David Brooks. Frum and Brooks discuss the origins of the term neocon, what the neocons got right, and why they should be listened to today. Brooks describes how America’s problems long predate Trump, and why elections alone cannot fix what has been lost. Together, Frum and Brooks explore whether the country is capable of moral renewal, what rebuilding would actually require, and why recovery, if it comes at all, will be slow, difficult, and deeply personal.\n\nFinally, David ends the episode with his thoughts on Death by Lightning, a television series on Netflix based on the assassination of President James Garfield, and how, when watching historical dramas, we need to look back on the past with a contextual lens, one that we should bring to our present too.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nDavid Frum: Hello, and welcome to The David Frum Show. I’m David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. If you have listened to or watched this program before, you will notice that this present opening looks and sounds a little different from usual. Let me hasten to assure you that most of the show will look as normal. There will be a dialogue between me and David Brooks, columnist at The New York Times and contributor to The Atlantic; that will look and sound normal. And we will conclude with a discussion of the new four-part Netflix miniseries Death by Lightning, a dramatization based on the assassination of President [James] Garfield; that will look and sound like normal. But this opening will not, and does not, look and sound like normal, and I have to beg your pardon for that.\n\nHere’s my excuse. I planned a family vacation in South America for the final two weeks in January. I prerecorded the dialogue and the book talk and also the opening monologue because I thought, What crazy things can possibly happen in the last two weeks of January? Well, you know as well as I what crazy things have happened in the last two weeks of January: NATO allies like France and Britain, Denmark and Norway moving troops into Greenland. An altercation at Davos between the president of the United States and the prime minister of Canada that concluded, or has yielded. Members of the Trump Cabinet now promoting the secession of the Canadian province of Alberta to retaliate and threatening Canada with all kinds of massive tariffs to punish Canada for its prime minister getting too much attention at Davos. President [Donald] Trump making it clear that everything he’s been doing in foreign policy is motivated by his thwarted desire for a Nobel Peace Prize. And of course, and above all, the terrible events in the city of Minneapolis, where a second American citizen has been killed by agents purportedly enforcing the law while that American citizen was, according to most, if not all, video evidence presenting no danger to anybody, least of all officers of the law. And the terrible, systematic lying that has surrounded each of these terrible incidents, with their attacks on basic norms of American rights and process.\n\nIt’s not just the American citizens who have been killed that are a scandal that shocks the nation coming from Minneapolis; forces of the law have burst into private homes without a warrant, have seized people—the wrong people—hauled them out into the streets in their underwear in a Minnesota January. We are hearing reports of deaths in detention, people being reportedly killed in detention. This is all on top of the previous cases of people being sent by American immigration authorities to torture centers in third countries, centers that have been closed down by American courts because they violate basic norms of due process, and American civil rights and civil liberties. It’s a shocking, shocking story.\n\n And even as I record, in the final week of January, it is amazing how much of this story remains murky and mysterious. An American citizen has been killed. We don’t know the names of his killer. We don’t know whether the killer has been removed from the streets of Minneapolis. The representatives of the state of Minnesota have been debarred from investigating what happened, how this terrible event could have unfolded in the way that it did. A man has been shot in the back when he was disarmed, while he was being beaten—in a beating we all saw on camera—for the apparent offense of recording the activities of law enforcement and personnel, which was his total personal right to do, while carrying a gun, which was his right to do. I’m someone who’s pretty skeptical of the way American gun rights have unfolded, but skepticism does not mean that, if you carry a gun according to the law of your state, that that gives the agents of the state power or right to seize you, force you to the ground, remove the gun from you, beat you, and then shoot you in the back, reportedly 10 times. Something has gone terribly, terribly wrong, and it’s getting wronger.\n\nNow, the good news is that a substantial majority of American citizens object to this wrong and oppose it, and that majority seems to be growing. The bad news is, is that an important minority continue to defend these actions, and are rallying to the support of the personnel who commit these acts and the larger structures of permission that authorize and enabled and defend these acts.\n\nThis a country that is now split on the basic question, “Can an American citizen be gunned down on the streets of his own city while carrying in his hands nothing more dangerous than a cellphone?” Opinion is split.\n\nDavid Brooks and I, in our dialogue, will talk a little bit about how, someday, the MAGA forces, the people who supported MAGA, may be reintegrated into the American family, into American democracy. David Brooks advocates a very open-armed and forgiving approach; I’m not so sure that he’s right about that. But that is something that we’ll discuss, and you will form your own opinion after hearing our discussion.\n\nFor now, we have the problem that the people who are carrying out these acts, against the wishes of the great majority of Americans, with the support of a minority of Americans, they remain in power. Now, I think we all know MAGA people and we all know that, most people who supported Donald Trump, or many of the people who supported Donald Trump, did not begin as bad people, but they are justifying bad things—and things that are getting worse and worse and worse at an accelerating rate. It is sobering to consider, if this is what has happened in year one of the Trump administration, as Trump and his people come closer to whatever kind of reckoning is available in November of 2026, what will the year ahead look like? What does 2026 hold? It looks like it will hold more abuses, more offenses, more attacks, more contempt for basic American values and law. And we all have to find our way to come up with some kind of effective collective response.\n\nWe appear to be heading to a government shutdown, as Democrats in the Senate say they will not vote to fund ICE if it continues the kind of operations it’s been doing. This may be quite a long government shutdown because there’s going to be a lot at stake for everybody involved.\n\nBut we are facing a kind of crisis in American democracy that is worse than anything that even people who were really worried about it, as I was, predicted a year ago, never mind at the very beginning of the Trump experiment in 2016, 2017, 2015, when Trump declared for office. We’ve been kind of walking a path to moral degradation, and we’re trying to stay away from the finale of moral ruin.\n\nI don’t know what’s ahead. I’m terribly worried. I hope we find a way out together, that there can become some kind of collective American agreement on what it means to hold the rights that American citizens should hold, on what it means that American citizens are being gunned down in the streets of their cities—on the sidewalk, in their cars. That American citizens, naturalized citizens, but American as anybody else, are being hauled from their houses without a warrant, and that important people in American government insist that there no warrant is due because the provisions of 1776, which listed abuses of the search power as one of the causes of separation of the United States from Great Britain, that those principles no longer apply, at least they don’t apply to Americans of certain kinds of last names, and certain kind of accents, and certain kinds of backgrounds and personal stories, and certain kind of skin colors—that other Americans have got them. that MAGA people carry guns at their events and, of course, don’t expect to be executed for it, but other Americans don’t have those rights; MAGA people expect to be served with warrants in their homes if someone needs to search their homes for something, but other people don’t have those rights. They don’t extend to others the rights they claim for themselves.\n\nHow will we find a way from this impasse? Well, David and I will talk about it, and I hope you will stick around to watch a more normal-looking version of this program.\n\nAnd now by dialogue with David Brooks.\n\nFrum: David Brooks is a contributing editor at The Atlantic. Oh, he’s also one of the most popular writers and speakers in the entire English-speaking world, with a career that spans many decades at every distinguished institution. I was a colleague of his at The Weekly Standard in the 1990s. But you probably know him from his role at The New York Times as one of the most influential newspaper columnists in America for more than two decades, from his appearances on PBS and NPR, or you may have seen one of his innumerable appearances on public platforms, where he delights audiences in every state of this country and every country of the world, it seems. He is an indefatigable writer. He is the author of more books than I can even tally, all of which have gone on to enormous success. Most recently is the 2023 book How to Know a Person: The Art of Seeing Others Deeply and Being Deeply Seen. And I’m just so grateful he has taken time away from his whirligig of activities to join me today on The David Frum Show.\n\nDavid, welcome.\n\nDavid Brooks: I think we were actually colleagues at The Wall Street Journal first, before The Weekly Standard, back in the ’80s—\n\nFrum: You know—\n\nBrooks: —or ’90s.\n\nFrum: —that’s true. That’s true. And you went off to glory at The Wall Street Journal Europe, where you covered the ’89 uprisings, terrifying your grandmother. You had a wonderful line—I remember this—that she called you in Brussels and said, But, David, what if the revolution spreads?\n\nBrooks: (Laughs.) True, and sure enough, it did.\n\nFrum: (Laughs.) I wanna talk to you about your recent article for The Atlantic that appeared online in December and then in the print edition in January, called “The Neocons Were Right.” I think a lot of people are used to hearing this term used as a kind of shorthand in politics or conspiracy theory, but maybe some of us don’t know exactly what the term means. So could you explain what a neoconservative is, or was, and why it mattered once upon a time and now?\n\nBrooks: Yeah. When people hear these days neocon, they think of the Iraq War, and they think of Republicans who supported the Iraq War. But neoconservatism, actually, it has its roots in a dining hall, a college dining hall.\n\nThe City College of New York was a school, or still is a school mostly for immigrant kids—in those days, I think no tuition; now very low tuition. So if you’ve just come to America and you wanna make it, City College is a great place to go. And in the 1930s, there were a group of young, mostly Jewish kids who were communists. And they had names like Nathan Glazer and Seymour Martin Lipset and Irving Kristol. And they were a certain kind of communist; they were Trotskyites. And the Trotskyites were the smart communists, basically. (Laughs.) And there were another kind called the Stalinists, and they were sort of the dumb conformists, to be honest. And in the dining hall, the Trotskyites, like Kristol and Nathan Glazer, ate in Alcove 1, a little part of the dining hall, and the Stalinists ate in Alcove 2. And the Trotskyites were so much better at beating the Stalinists in argument, the Stalinists, in true Stalinist fashion, forbade their members from debating with the Trotskyites.\n\nAnd so they were communists in the ’30s. And then along comes the war; a bunch of the neocons, like Irving Kristol, served in World War II. And they realized communism was not gonna work. And so they became disillusioned with that. And then they became pretty standard Franklin Roosevelt Democrats. And some, like Nathan Glazer, went to work for John F. Kennedy. And in the early ’60s, there was great faith in social science. Politics didn’t have to be this big, messy ideological thing; we could just sic a lot of economists at a problem, and they would devise a rational, technocratic solution. And Irving Kristol and another, vaguely, person called neoconservative, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, formed a magazine called The Public Interest, and in the very first issue, Moynihan said, We’ve learned how to make a society work. And they were just standard-issue Democrats.\n\nAnd then along comes 1968, ’69, a lot of the policies that they had so earnestly championed in the early ’60s were not working. American cities went into decay, rising crime rates, rising divorce rates, more kids born out of wedlock. There was just a lot of social anarchy. I was a kid in New York City in the 1970s, and everybody got mugged. The crime rates were incredible. There was a serial castrator on the Upper West Side who would take kids, lead ’m into Central Park, castrate them, and then murder them. And his nickname was Charlie Chop-Off. (Laughs.) And the crime was so bad in those days, Charlie Chop-Off was not even a big story. (Laughs.) But so there was so much social decay, and so the neocons, the people we now call neocons, said, Whoa, all the social planning that we had such faith in 10 years ago, we were wrong. Like, Well, the world’s a lot more complicated than we thought. And as Irving Kristol famously put it, a neoconservative is “a liberal who’s been mugged by reality.”\n\nAnd the second thing that happened in the 1960s was a group of—these immigrant kids believed in the bourgeois values: Work hard. Dress neatly. Respect your parents. Along came these rich hippies, saying, Don’t work hard. Drop out. Do drugs. And they were outraged; they were just morally offended.\n\nAnd so that’s really the roots of neoconservatism. It’s not some right-wing Republican thing; it started as a strategy of dissent within the Democratic Party.\n\nFrum: Okay, but the distance in time from the 1960s to us is the same as the distance in time from when these people were young, in the 1930s, to Reconstruction.\n\nBrooks: (Laughs.)\n\nFrum: (Laughs.) Did I just do that math right? Yeah, it’s, like, 60 years. So why would you write a magazine article in 2026 saying these people who were active from 1930-something to 1960-something were right about anything to do with us? How does this bear on our lives today in any way?\n\nBrooks: Because I’m a human anachronism. That’s why.\n\nFrum: (Laughs.) No, no, you have your finger on the pulse. We count on your observations to tell us what’s going on in America, so what’s going on in America that any of this helps us with?\n\nBrooks: I think what the neoconservatives can do is they teach us, first of all, some of the things they learned in the ’60s: Life is really complicated. You should do social policy. You should try to improve government, but you should realize that most policies fail, and you should really have good reasons, and you should make it bureaucratic. But I think the core insight for the neocons—they not only grew up as policy people; they were influenced by literature, by culture, by theology, by Talmudic study. And so they made no distinction between what you would call theological, philosophical, cultural growth—moral formation—and policy. And so they brought a much more humanistic lens to see policy; it’s not just about economics and growth. [The] elemental question is (a) can we build a civilization we can be proud of, and (b) can we create policies that will nurture values, the right kind of values?\n\nIn 1985, one of the great neoconservative political scientists, a guy named James Q. Wilson, who spent much of his career at Harvard, said, All we’re trying to do is trying to inculcate certain virtues, whether we’re talking about education, when we’re talking about trying to reduce recidivism, when we’re trying to talk about conducting our fiscal policy. And we can either have good values, and for the neoconservatives, the good values were the bourgeois values—being decent to people, being neighborly, showing up on time, working hard—not lofty Kantian values, or we can have bad values. And if we run deficits, we’re basically behaving selfishly to future generations. If we subsidize nonwork, then we will discourage people from becoming industrious and that kind of person. And so I think one of the things they do—and especially in a moment right now, when we’re in a myriad of really moral [crises] in our politics, where basically 78 million Americans take a look at Donald Trump and they see nothing morally wrong.\n\nFrum: Okay, so we are at a moment—I was wondering where you were going to go—we’re at a moment when agencies of government, Cabinet-level departments, are, for their own amusement, tweeting out variations that are obviously intended to be variations on Nazi Party slogans: “One people, one empire, one leader”; when we have masked armed men roaming American cities, detaining people without any right to detain them, beating up people, in some cases killing them. We have the most corrupt administration—not in American history, but I keep saying, if this were a Nigerian administration, it would be one of the most corrupt administrations in Nigerian history—to your point about bourgeois values, where the president of the United States was a close friend to, and seems to be operating a cover-up on behalf of, one of the most notorious child-molestation rings (Laughs.) in American history. And how is Irving Kristol going to help us with any of this?\n\nBrooks: (Laughs.) Well, (a) ’cause he reminds us—and especially his wife, Gertrude Himmelfarb, the historian—he reminds us the power of the spirit of an age, that we live within a moral ecology tnd that moral ecology is not only constructed by each of us in our own behaviors, but it’s constructed by the arts, by literature, and by the example set by great political leaders.\n\nThis is Gertrude Himmelfarb, the great historian of Victorian England—in 1810, it was completely normal for a guy to get drunk after work, go home, and beat his wife. There was no harsh judgment about that; that’s just the way things are. And along came a group called the Clapham Sect, who were basically evangelicals, and they said, No, that is not gonna be acceptable behavior anymore. So they reset the norms of what acceptable behavior was going to be. They’re sort of the beginnings of Victorian morality. And as part of that, they said, We have such respect for human dignity, we’re gonna campaign against the slave trade. And so what Himmelfarb describes is a period of moral improvement for a whole society. We all live on the cultural capital of centuries gone by, and if we tear away at that capital, then we’re lost in the world Stephen Miller talked about last week, which is a war of all against all, where force is the only thing that matters; a shared morality does not matter.\n\nAnd so I think they give us the tools to think about, How do we reconstruct a social order so we can trust one another once again and so we can treat each other decently once again?\n\nFrum: Many of the people that you and I knew when we were young have gone on to power and prominence, and they started off sharing many of the ideas, or at least participating in many of the ideas that you’re describing. And today, we have a world in which the bright lights of the younger intellectual right are inspired at best, at best, by the idea of abolishing the difference between church and state and letting the church run everything, and at worst by outright fascism, and at very worst by flirtations with literal Nazism. So, that’s what’s happened to the conservative world in which we’ve moved. And the result is that people of conservative instinct, which I still consider myself to be and I think you may as well, find ourselves mute and voiceless when we hear things from people on the more liberal, or left, side of the spectrum, saying, Well, they have some things we don’t like, but what do we have to set against this when the choices really do seem to be wokeism or fascism? (Laughs.) How is Irving Kristol going to help us with our dilemma? If I have to choose, I’m choosing wokeism over fascism, but I’m not crazy about either.\n\nBrooks: Yeah, you’re really cheering me up. So glad I came on the podcast. No, I’m kidding. (Laughs.) You and I—\n\nFrum: (Laughs.) No concessions—speaking of, like, the neoconservative spirit—no concessions to the need for uplift here. We’re going for the full gloom-and-doom situation.\n\nBrooks: (Laughs.) So you and I got out of school at about the same time and entered our business at the same time. And at that time, I was working at National Review in the mid-’80s, and another group of people came out of school at the same time. And I came out of the University of Chicago; you came out of a fancier school back east. But there were a group of students from Dartmouth—\n\nFrum: I think you meant easier school, but you’re being polite.\n\nBrooks: (Laughs.) Maybe easier, yeah.\n\nFrum: (Laughs.)\n\nBrooks: So there were a group from Dartmouth who worked at a magazine called The Dartmouth Review, and people will know some of them still: Laura Ingraham, Dinesh D’Souza. There was a guy named Ben Hart. There was a guy named Greg Fossedal. And I did not appreciate the distinction; I thought we were all on the same team. But there was a distinction—I think earnest people like me and you, we were pro-conservative. We had read Edmund Burke and Isaiah Berlin and Adam Smith, and we had these earnest ideas that was pro-a conservative vision of society. But Dinesh D’Souza and Laura Ingraham, they were not pro-conservative; they were anti-left.\n\nAnd there was an episode that illustrates for me how they were different from us: that during the ’80s, to protest apartheid, students on a lot of campuses put up shantytowns, and it was to represent the suffering of Black citizens of South Africa under apartheid. And one night, a bunch of the editors of The Dartmouth Review descended on the shantytown protests and, with sledgehammers, slammed them down. And I remember being appalled, (a) because apartheid really was evil and was worth opposing, but (b) going through a protest with sledgehammers and destroying it, that’s not America; that’s [Joseph] Goebbels. That is really thuggish fascism. And I thought they were low-rent; I thought those people were intellectually mediocre. But it turns out there were a lot more people who were anti-left than there were pro-conservative, especially as the time went [by].\n\nAnd so what you have in the Trump administration is people with the same profile as the Dartmouth Review crowd: They went to elite schools, but they hated what they found there. That’s Steven Miller, who went to Duke. That’s Pete Hegseth, who went to Princeton. That’s J. D. Vance, who went to Yale Law. Now, you can go down the list. It’s Elon Musk and Donald Trump went to Penn. And so these are not pro-conservative. These are oppositional nihilists who hate the liberal establishment. And I found it easy, when I was saying college, to be more conservative than my professors but still have reverence for their learning. But these people do not have reverence for learning; they just want to offend the bourgeoisie. And so that’s what it’s become. And then they’ve produced spawn of young people who just think, That’s cool. That’s edgy. And of course, you have to up the dosage when you’re giving people edgy nihilism—it just has to get worse and worse and worse. And as Richard Weaver, a philosopher from the 1950s, said, The problem with the younger generation is they haven’t read the minutes to the last meeting. And so you get a group of people who, when they see fascistic behavior, don’t understand where that eventually leads.\n\nFrum: When you set out the stage for us, you described events or thinkers or currents that were active between the 1930s and the 1960s. How does any of this get attached to the Iraq War all those years later?\n\nBrooks: Well, I think it got attached—and I’ll tell my story—I think what happened was, neoconservatives, as I said, really believe in the nature of a regime. They want America to stand for certain values, and they’re appalled by regimes that stand for evil values. And the Soviet Union was like that, and Saddam Hussein’s Iraq was like that. And so they said, If you have a regime that is internally and domestically poisonous and oppressive, it will be dangerous to the world. And I would say, in my life in the ’90s, I was covering the end of apartheid, the end of the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, the Oslo peace process in the Middle East. I was watching democracy be created, and it seemed to me we were on a tidal wave of creating societies with better democratic values. And so I think a lot of neocons like me or others and our elders supported the Iraq War for that reason: because they thought fighting for a democratic wave was the right thing to do.\n\nWhat they did not sufficiently appreciate, what we, and especially me, did not sufficiently—the other thing I had said earlier about neocons: epistemological modesty. Be careful about trying to change complex circumstances, ’cause you’re gonna screw it up. And we ignored one of the core tenets of our own belief system; we were so swept up in the moment. And if we’d only gone back to the single most famous neoconservative foreign-policy essay of all time, was written by Jeane Kirkpatrick, and her argument was that if you’re gonna try to a democracy in an authoritarian context, you need generations of civic planning, of civic organization, of moral foundations of a democracy. You can’t just imagine you can do it overnight. And we forgot that lesson.\n\nFrum: Mm. Well, we are, in many ways, living in the 2020s in the Iraq hangover, that many people—people of good faith, people of bad faith—took the lesson from the Iraq experience to stay out of everything. And so we’ve had a decade and a half where America has largely been absent from many of the great decisions of the time. And in the Obama administration, [President Barack] Obama backed away from the Syrian civil war, a war that looks more and more important the farther we get from it. He laid down some red lines, and he said he would enforce them, and he had, certainly, I think, abundant authority on his own to do it, but the moment Congress raised any objection, he backed away and then said, Okay, well, it’s because of Congress. My hands are tied. I’m powerless to intervene. And so you got this extraordinary wave of refugees from Syria—I forget the number of how many millions of people. Half the population of Syria was internally displaced; millions left. Millions of other people from other places moved at the same time and destabilized the politics of Europe and the whole world.\n\nThe United States was quite passive when the Russians invaded Crimea in 2014, and the Trump years are their own story. And now we see people in the streets of Iranian cities chanting, looking for American help, and we are in a country where people no longer feel that there is a right, a calling, or any likelihood of success in America intervening in these important conflicts. And the world is on its own now, without American guidance, at the mercy of whoever looks like the second-strongest candidate to guide the world.\n\nBrooks: Yeah, when we withdrew, our friend Robert Kagan wrote a book called The Jungle Grows Back, which is to say, when there’s no social order holding the world, then the wolves take over. And wolves like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] and others have taken over. And people [in] this country on the populist right and sometimes on the left think, Oh, that old neoliberal order, that was all a scam. It was a scam for America to exercise imperial hegemony, but it was all just words. But that liberal world order that people built after World War II, and that people like Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy and Harry Truman enforced, that really did restrain people. And so the world has just become a more dangerous place. And America has taken one of our great assets, which is our ideals—I’ve covered so many people around the world, and they want democracy; they want dignity—and we have squandered that strength. It’s an actual source of strength. And then the final thing, we replaced it now with Donald Trump. We’re no longer hanging back. Suddenly, we’re launching forever wars all the hell all over the place, but we’re not doing it on behalf of ideals; we’re doing it on behalf of nihilism, on behalf of oil. I feel sorry for all my left-wing friends, who used to—and when they talked about George W. Bush, they would say, He claims to be for democracy, but really, this war is all about oil. And they had the subtle ways to see what the real meaning of what Bush was saying was. But that skill’s no longer necessary because Donald Trump says, Yeah, it’s all about oil. What are you gonna do about it?\n\nAnd so I would ask people, “If you thought American foreign-policy idealism was discredited by Iraq, which it largely was, how do you like the anti-idealistic foreign policy, a policy of pure material greed?”\n\nFrum: Let’s go back to these old books and essays, and think about, What are the lessons that, in the age of Trumpism, we need, whether we are broadly sympathetic to conservative projects or if we’re broadly unsympathetic. Let’s start with the other side. If you’re someone who’s not a conservative and you think of yourself as a liberal or even a progressive, is there any value in any of these old ideas in the face of an administration, as I said, where at best we’re looking at people who wanna overthrow the separation of church and state, with the church in charge, and at worst functional fascists and on the edge outright Nazi sympathizers and apologists? Why isn’t the lesson for a person of liberal views or progressive views to say, You know what? Conservatism was always a terrible idea. I never liked any of these folks. They’re now even worse than before. I have nothing to learn from any of them?\n\nBrooks: Well, a lot of my more progressive friends are always nostalgic for the last conservatives. And so I started saying, Well, wait ’til we have a Republican government that makes you nostalgic for Donald Trump. (Laughs.) So that seems to be the trend.\n\nI would say there are certain things that are not liberal or conservative. They used to be consensus American positions. One is that we have a social order, that there are certain rules and certain beliefs and values that we share, that form the basis of how we live. George Marsden is a great historian, and he wrote this about Martin Luther King [Jr.]’s rhetoric: He says, What gave King’s rhetoric such force is the idea that right and wrong are written into the fabric of the universe. That slavery is not just wrong in some times and some places; it’s always wrong. Segregation is not just wrong in some times and some places; it is always wrong. Right and wrong are written into the fabric of the universe. And when you have that social order, people feel held. You can have a society ’cause we have a shared understanding of what’s right and wrong. We have a shared sense of norms about what’s right and wrong, so we’re gonna behave [with] each other; we can trust each other. Two generations ago, 60 percent of Americans said, Yeah, my neighbors are trustworthy. That’s not a liberal or a conservative thing; that was a great human achievement. And what happened? We shredded the shared moral order. And that was not just a conservative project; it was a liberal project too.\n\nAnd so one of the things we did is we privatized morality. We said to people, Come up with your own values. And the problem with that is that there’s no shared morality if everyone has to come up with their own values. And the other problem with that is, unless your name is Aristotle, you can’t come up with values. Walter Lippmann, a great columnist in the 1950s, wrote a book in which he said, If what is right and wrong is based on what each individual feels according to their emotions, then we are outside the bounds of civilization. And so this moral collapse, I think, is what undergirds the rise of Trump. It undergirds the alienation. It undergirds the idea that we want a politics that’s based not on ideals and values, that it’s about power and it’s about who has more force. And so if we’re gonna get over Trumpism or the [Alternative for Democracy] AfFD or [French politician Marine] Le Pen, we need a set of ideals that can hold society together and create some social trust, and we need ideals that have some roots—and this is what the New York conservatives were good about—in universal values. It’s not just my kind. All through much of human history, my kind of people are the kind of people I care about, and I don’t care about the other kind. But it was a great achievement of civilization to say, No, I care about all people, maybe not all equally, but there are certain ideas that apply to everybody, ideas of dignity, democracy, and kindness. And that was an achievement.\n\nAnd so I think the neoconservatives were inheritors, maybe more conservative than not, some not, but they were the inheritors of that idea, and they caused us to see politics and see our national culture through the lens of either a shared moral order or a lack of one.\n\nFrum: I am, like you, formed in many ways by this tradition. I’ve got some critical distance from it. I never really felt like I was a part—I read the books; I never felt like I was part of the social circle that was such an important aspect of the neoconservative world when it was a real thing. So I knew these things through print rather than through personality. And in a way, that was kind of disqualifying because neoconservatism was as much a milieu as it was a set of ideas, and I was not a member of that milieu. Maybe I’m just anti-social. But the question I think about a lot as we are trying to move beyond Trumpism is it does seem like there’s about to be a big swing of political power in the United States in ’26 and ’28. I worried through the year 2025 that Trump would somehow be able to distort the election enough to hold on to power, the coming congressional election. I think the tide against him is now too big for those methods to work. Unless he tries an outright coup d'état, I don’t know how he stops it.\n\nSo there’s likely to be a shift in power. And the question I find myself thinking about a lot—and I have no answer to this, and I’d be very interested to be guided by the wisdom you draw from these texts and your own wisdom. When President [Joe] Biden entered office in 2021, clearly, his thought, or clearly to me, his thought was, We need to get past the recent unpleasantness. We need a policy of accommodation. We need a policy of looking forward, not backward. And while, when people have actually sacked the Capitol, they have to be held to account, we’re not gonna object too much if their higher-ups—a justice system goes real, real slow on bringing justice to the people who gave the orders for the sacking on January 6, 2021. We’ll punish the actual foot soldiers, but we’ll leave the colonels and generals alone mostly, to the extent we can. The question I am struggling with is: If and when power does shift, was the Biden attitude the right one, to be reapplied in ’27 and ’29, or do we need some kind of lustration, something like what the Czechs and Hungarians and Poles did after 1989? They said, Look, we have an elite that was authoritarian, corrupt, and criminal, in some cases homicidal. And we can’t do justice in every case, but we need to find some system to hold the previous administration to a moral and legal account, and exclude them from power. I can’t make up my mind what’s the right answer. What guidance would you draw from these old texts?\n\nBrooks: Yeah, I guess I would not be for mass defenestrations.\n\nFrum: I’m not throwing them out the window.\n\nBrooks: (Laughs.)\n\nFrum: No, I’m serious. What should happen—Jeanine Pirro, a U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia who’s leading the charge to bring these utterly ridiculous criminal charges against the head of the Federal Reserve to destroy the independence of the Federal Reserve and subordinate monetary policy to Trump’s election needs. What should happen to her?\n\nBrooks: Yeah. So first, I think the problem with the Biden administration, one of them, was that he said, correctly, “This is a battle for the soul of America”; he had no idea how to think about that. And then he should have read more neoconservative books ’cause they would have said, Here’s the soul of America. Here’s how it’s being destroyed. [Here’s] how you can restore it.\n\nThe second thing, and one of the reasons I’m not against going after these people as aggressively—when they broke the law, if they break the law, they should break the law. George Santayana, the philosopher, said that Americans don’t solve problems; they just leave them behind. And I think what’s gonna happen after Trump is that people are gonna take a look at corruption in Washington on an unprecedented scale, and they’re gonna wanna do what Americans did after Watergate: They’re gonna wanna turn the page. And in 1976, Jimmy Carter looked like integrity. And so it’s not like—and I actually think Gerald Ford did the right thing in pardoning Richard Nixon because we didn’t need to wage the same war over and over again. I thought the indictments of Trump during the Biden administration ended up helping Trump get reelected. And so I worry that that will happen again or that will just motivate the same battle lines over and over again.\n\nVoters who voted for him, they have real issues, real concerns, which Trump is not addressing. The job is to win them over, not to lock them in the same battle lines as before. I think societies move forward the same way human beings move forward: through a process of rupture and repair. Trump has ruptured our society from top to bottom, and I think you just move on, you turn the page, and you offer something different. After Nixon, you got something different in Carter. After Carter, you got something different in Reagan. After Reagan–[George H.W.] Bush, you got something different in [President Bill] Clinton. And people want to try something different.\n\nFrum: You make a very compelling case, and as so often, you’re almost certainly right. But let me just keep thinking.\n\nOne of the teachings of the neoconservative world was that these moral beliefs matter, that culture matters. And they were very impatient with social scientists who said, No, what matters are deep structures of wealth and power. They didn’t like that way of thinking. But deep structures of wealth and power do often matter. And so after Trump leaves office, it will still be true that the people who became corrupt billionaires under Trump will remain corrupt billionaires, with all the political power that that entails—including, by the way, Trump’s children, who have made a corrupt fortune in the single year of his first year of his presidency through these cryptocurrency operations they’re running, which have left every purchaser losing 95 percent of their money but have left the sellers very rich. That is not just wealth; that’s power.\n\nThe changes in the media landscape that have concentrated informational power in the hands of people who are beholden to the Trump administration, whether it’s the social-media companies or the new conglomerates in what we used to call television—I don’t know what we’ll call it [as we] go on—those will still remain. The changes that have happened inside the Republican Party, those will remain. People talk about doing something about these ICE recruits, but they’re still going to remain, probably, government employees with this rogue police force that doesn’t seem to answer to any kind of—that’s all going to be there.\n\nAnd how do you say, Well, we’re going to re-moralize the society, when the structures of wealth and power bequeathed by what used to be there, where those structures are all still there, just waiting for the next economic downturn to take power? That’s what happened to Biden: He just assumed, Well, we can re-moralize society, he thought and forgot, well, if there’s a little bit of inflation in ’22 and ’23, all of this changes, and everything that was sinister before reemerges from the surface of the waters to claim new victims.\n\nBrooks: Yeah, there’s clearly a lot of weight behind your argument. I think we all acknowledge that it was a big mistake not to punish any of the 2008 financial-crisis architects. That just struck people as a moral job undone. So sometimes you do have to have truth and reconciliation, with the emphasis on truth.\n\nOn the other hand, I think the big test for people in the years ahead is to separate Trump voters, working-class voters, from the Trump cronies. And I think that will happen (a) as people are realizing that the Trump cronies ride to power on the votes of the working class. And the working class die much sooner. They earn much less. They’re much more likely to get divorced. They’re much more likely to say they have no friends. So the needs of the working class are really something that needs to be addressed, and Trump is not doing it. And the job is to separate those working-class voters from the cronies.\n\nThe Republican Party in our lifetime, in my view, is always gonna be a working-class party. That’s true of every right-wing party in the Western world. What used to be the bankers’ party is now a working-class party. And it is a great achievement to become a multiracial working-class party, if the Republicans can pull it off. And so we’re not going to go back to the Republican Party that you and I knew in 1990. It’s gonna be a working-class party.\n\nFrum: What does that mean? What do you mean when you say it’s going to be a working-class party? My sense of the Trump vote in 2024 was that the Trump voter was more affluent, on average, than the [Kamala] Harris voter. And while Harris did better among college-educated people than Trump did, that Trump was competitive and that noncollege voters are not always the same thing as working-class voters. They may simply be older voters who finished their schooling at a time when education was less prevalent than it’s been since the 1970s.\n\nBrooks: Yeah, there are obviously a lot of Trump billionaires floating around out there. But if you look at the upper-middle, educated sectors of our society—whether it’s Palo Alto; Bethesda, Maryland; Westchester County, New York; Boston—those are all Democratic areas. And to me, the best predictor of voting patterns is no longer income; it basically is not a predictor of voting patterns anymore. It’s education levels. And Democrats are winning over the highly educated former Republican suburbs, and Republicans are winning over the less-educated working class in rural areas. And I guess I use working class a little loosely; I really mean education levels.\n\nAnd it’s simply, that’s the divide not only in this country, but across Western Europe. And why is it the divide? Because the Information Age economy rewards education with money. And a lot of people look around their societies, whether it’s here or in Hungary or in England and in France, and they see the 20 percent most-educated people living in extremely affluent lifestyles, sending their kids to the same schools, replicating a caste system based upon education and inherited privilege, and, by the way, ruling working-class and conservative voices out of the media and out of college campuses. And if you tell people that one top 20 percent is gonna rig the game generation after generation, they’re gonna flip the table. And that’s why populism is not only an American thing. This phenomenon is happening everywhere in the Western world as we screw up the need to respond to the nature of the Information Age economy.\n\nAnd so, to me, the central challenge is to separate those people from MAGA. And I think [the way] that is most doable is if we try to put Trump in the rearview mirror.\n\nFrum: Yeah, well, MAGA is doing a pretty good job of separating themselves. And the tariff policy, which is essentially a tax on purchases of goods, and the less you make, the more of your income is taken—it’s a nakedly, upwardly redistributive thing—you combine that with the other things they’re doing, not just the tax cuts, but the destruction of tax enforcement in ways that favor those who own businesses. So for the affluent self-employed, paying taxes becomes ever more optional. For the people who spend their income on goods, taxes become ever more baffling and mysterious, and are included in the prices of the things you buy. So that’s doing a separation. And I think that the way that the Trump people have chosen to do immigration enforcement is destroying the prospects of the Republican Party as a multiracial party. So that work is being done.\n\nBut we are going to be left with, yes, many of the disaffections you described, but also with a governing elite, on the conservative side of the spectrum, that really has tasted the benefits of jettisoning democratic norms, jettisoning democratic institutions, and using violence as a tool of power. Do they unlearn those ideas from mere political defeat, or does something more need to happen? What does Irving Kristol tell us about that?\n\nBrooks: (Laughs.) He would talk about the circulation of elites, that you can circulate elites pretty quickly. And all the people who were the elites in the Republican Party under George W. Bush, they thought they were gonna be in every Republican administration going forward, but that didn’t happen because Trump and Heritage Foundation and all those people brought in a new elite. CPAC, when I was a young conservative, was considered the fringe of the fringe, and it became the mainstream.\n\nThis is not unusual in American history. The people who were the elite under John F. Kennedy and Harry Truman were no longer the elite under Gary Hart and Bill Clinton. They had an entire shift in elites. And so you can have a shift in elites. And I’m hopeful that there is a group on the Democratic Party that is now acting like an elite, and I mean that in a good way. They’re running universities, and they’re trying to be less crazy-left than they were. They’re running institutions that they’re trying to reform. Isaiah Berlin, who I mentioned, he had a phrase, I find myself on the rightward edge of the leftward tendency, and that’s where I find myself.\n\nFrum: The analogy I should have chosen was not lustration after 1989; it’s Reconstruction. That’s the American analogy, where the traditional governing elite of one of the great parties of much of the country committed itself to something not just in the defense of slavery, but to slavery-plus, fortified and amplified by treason. And until that generation has spent its 40 years in the wilderness, and a new generation has grown up, and the policies of the country have changed, and their victims have been brought into the political system—not just their disaffected followers, but also their victims—then you’re not going to have true stability again.\n\nSo I think, What are going to be the equivalents of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments that go into place to make sure not just that we put Trumpism behind, but so it really can’t happen again. And so the people who got rich and powerful, and who will remain rich and powerful, don’t use that wealth and power to attack American institutions in the way that the Trump people did in the first year of the second term, and looks like we got three more years to go.\n\nBrooks: Yeah, let me try a historical example on you. So in the 1920s and ’30s, we had vicious anti-immigration movements. We had the America Firsters, and we had Father [Charles] Coughlin, who was sort of a radio priest who had semi-fascist and anti-Semitic tendencies. And suddenly, along came Franklin Roosevelt, along came the Depression, along came World War II, and they were just discredited. And they were discredited from 1941 to probably 2006, at least. And they were discredited not by elites; they were discredited by the whole country. You did not wanna say the phrase “America First,” ’cause that would discredit you. And along comes Donald Trump, and when he first started saying the word “America First,” I was like, What is he doing? Everyone knows what “America First” is. (A) I’m not convinced he knew what the original “America First” was, (B) people had either no historical memory or they didn’t care, and so ideas that were discredited came back. And that is the nature of politics: It’s never over. No argument is ever settled. They come back. But, to me, it’s not what a certain set of prosecutors do. It’s whether the mass of America decides: That was despicable. That’s discredited. We don’t want any piece of that. And you can learn that lesson.\n\nFrum: That history is not going to repeat itself, because it took the Great Depression to discredit high tariffs, it took the Holocaust to discredit anti-Semitism, and it took Pearl Harbor and then the subsequent American triumph in two oceans and the complete collapse of fascist ideas in the fascist countries and the repudiations by the fascist countries themselves of their previous fascism. (Laughs.) And that string of things is so dramatic, it’s very unlikely to repeat. So it’s much more likely to happen that the Trump people are going to have a bad election or two. There will be some of the more selfish, materialistic plutocrats who will say, You know [what]? We overdid some things. We overdid some things. We shouldn’t have shot that woman in Minneapolis. We shouldn’t have done the tariffs so much. And if you wanna get rich out of politics, you should just have the deferred gratification to wait until you’ve left office, and then we’ll make you rich. Don’t do it while you’re in office; that’s just impulsive. And maybe less denigration of women and other minorities. And also, by the way, leave the anti-Semitism for the podcasters; don’t bring it into public. So those may be the lessons. But otherwise, good job, everybody, because what we’ve learned is that the system is much more vulnerable than anybody thought it was to authoritarian means for plutocratic ends, and let’s just get smarter for the next try. That’s what I worry is going to be the outcome, not the kind of grand repudiation that you got because of the series of catastrophes of the 1930s and ’40s.\n\nBrooks: Yeah, one of the things I think about and worry about is, I don’t think we’re ever going back to a pre-Trump presidency, which we had presidencies that were self-restrained, and they were strained by norms; they were strained by laws. But the presidents, I would interview them all, and I asked one president on his final day in office, What’d you learn being president that you didn’t know before? And he said, I learned there’s a lot of passive-aggressive behavior in government. The president says something, and nothing happens. And those were the restraints that were built into the system. Donald Trump has shown you can crash through all those restraints, both the legal and normative ones. And I have trouble believing any future president is gonna want to give back all that power, and so, whoever wins, we could be walking into an age where presidential power is ramped up and congressional power continues to deteriorate, which is a primary distortion of our system of government.\n\nFrum: David, thank you so much for making time. Thank you for sharing all this wisdom and history. I learned a lot, and I’m sure every viewer and listener did too. We’re grateful to you. Thank you.\n\nBrooks: It’s great to be extending our lifelong friendship.\n\nFrum: (Laughs.) Okay, bye-bye.\n\nFrum: Thanks so much to David Brooks for joining me today. Now, as I mentioned at the top of the program, my book this week is not a book at all; it’s a TV series, a four-part series on Netflix called Death by Lightning, about the presidency of James Garfield and his assassination at the hands of a killer named Charles Guiteau. It’s a delightful four-part series. I strongly recommend it. I enjoyed it enormously. Michael Shannon plays President Garfield. Matthew Macfadyen plays the assassin, Charles Guiteau. There’s both humor and heartbreak, and it’s really lovely. And I’m not here to be a total buzzkill about the series, just a little bit of one. There are some historical inaccuracies; I’m going to let them go. I’ll mention a couple of them.\n\nWhen we first meet James Garfield, he’s working on his farm. He seems a man of the soil. You see someone far away from the dirty word of Washington politics, utterly surprised that he’s invited to speak at the Republican convention of 1880. You wouldn’t know from the opening of the series that he was, at that time, a ninth-term congressman who had just been elevated to the United States Senate (Laughs.) and whose main residence was a three-story townhouse at the corner of 13th and I in Washington, D.C. Okay, let that go.\n\nNor am I going to complain about the hilarious depiction of his vice president, Chester Arthur, as a thuggish boozer, although, actually, Chester Arthur was quite a gentle man and had been, in his day, a pretty serious scholar of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. I think he was one of the stars of his class at Union College in upstate New York, and he was made Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nSo now, I’m not gonna quibble about those things. But what I am concerned about is this show introduces viewers who probably don’t know that much about it to an important period in American history, but at the price of deleting what made the period important, what the politics were about. It shows a lot of very personal quarrels, and many of these quarrels were indeed very personal, like the famous quarrel between Senators James Blaine and Roscoe Conkling, which was driven very much by ego and mutual dislike. So, yes, that’s all true, but it obscures, because it’s just too difficult to explain, what drove the politics of the period. And I wanna talk about that today because it confronts us with the tragic choices that people in the past have faced and helps us to maybe understand or have some patience for the tragic choices that we will face in our own time.\n\nJames Garfield was elected in 1880. He entered Congress during the Civil War. And in the post–Civil War period—and he retained a seat; he represented the northeastern part of Cleveland, near Lake Erie. The Civil War left behind two great issues to face for the traumatized country.\n\nThe first was what to do for and about the population of freed slaves, who had been subordinated, dehumanized, abused, who now were to be granted their freedom, but what did that freedom mean, and how was it to be made real? The 13th Amendment outlawed slavery. The 14th Amendment granted civil rights. The 15th Amendment granted voting rights. But those rights were often attacked by violence, by the neighbors of the freed slaves, and it was going to take a big military presence to continue to protect the slaves and their rights. What was to be done about that? How are they to be made full Americans? Should they be made full Americans? Should the rest of America undertake the costs and sacrifices necessary to make them full Americans? Problem one.\n\nProblem two: Before the Civil War, the federal government of the United States was a very tiny and slapdash affair, but it didn’t matter because the federal government didn’t do much before the Civil War. During the Civil War, the United States had become the most powerful military force on planet Earth, and even after the demobilization, everyone saw the tremendous latent power of the United States, both military and economic. But the government, much bigger than before the Civil War, was still a scandal. Jobs were given by patronage. The government was financed by tariffs that were kind of random and crazy and punitive. And all of politics was about distributing government jobs to people who would help the government, whoever won the election—usually the Republican—to win. There was no rational administration. Levels of corruption were extremely high. This all had to be brought into the modern era. That was problem two.\n\nThe great tragic choice was the political coalition that supported justice for problem one—that is, bringing the freed slaves fully into national life—was a very different coalition from the coalition that might exist to pull the United States government into the modern era. And politicians of the time were forced to choose. The so-called Stalwarts, who were the group around Roscoe Conkling, who was one of the characters in the drama, said, Our job is to try to bring the freed slaves into national life. Now, that’s gonna mean some very dirty politics—because this is not a popular cause in the Northern part of the country, certainly not after about 1873; it loses all its popularity. The only way we’re going to keep winning elections is if we use the tariffs to raise a lot of money from protected industries; if we use patronage and pork barrel to get a lot of votes and persuade people to vote for us even though they don’t like very much the things we’re doing for the freed slaves, but they like what we’re doing for them; and, above all, avoid anything that smacks of reform. It’s the old flag, it’s the old cause, it’s a Republican Party based in the Protestant small towns of the North, and we remain very suspicious of the Democratic big cities and certainly suspicious of the South. That’s coalition one.\n\nCoalition two said, No, we need to modernize. We need to bring some rationality to the tariff system. We need to suppress the post-war inflation with a new kind of monetary system and a new kind of banking system. We need to have a much more professional government. And that coalition means making inroads into the Democratic big cities of the North, and that means, of necessity, jettisoning concern for the freed slaves. And the people who took this approach to politics, unlike the Stalwarts, who took the first, they were known as the Half-Breeds. And a lot of the battle of the 1870s and 1880s are these battles between Stalwarts and Half-Breeds. Should you have a Reconstruction politics, or should you have a modernization politics?\n\nI’ve simplified this enormously, and people who are versed in the period will detect many errors of nuance and emphasis in what I just said, but that’s basically the problem. And without telling people who are long dead (Laughs.) what they should have done, understanding that problem helps us to understand the period and it helps us to understand ourselves because their choices were ugly, and our choices are often ugly too, and political success goes to those who best manage the choice.\n\nGarfield became president in 1880, and inaugurated in 1881, not because he was a hero—he had been a very great war hero; he’d behaved very gallantly at the Battle of Chickamauga especially. But he was not a political hero. He was a person who balanced and served political expediency. There’s a scene in the series that, when you put it into context, shows what Garfield was and what he wasn’t.\n\nSo there’s a scene in the series where Garfield is visited by men, African American men, in what appear to be Union uniforms, and they appear to be Union veterans. And he says to them, “And I tell you now, in the closing days of this campaign, that I would rather be with you and defeated than against you and victorious.” Well, that’s very inspiring. That’s very inspiring. Did it happen? So I pulled off my shelf the 1978 biography by Allan Peskin and looked up the incident. And sure enough, it did happen. And those words were spoken.\n\nBut something else (Laughs.) then happened. So the people to whom he spoke those words were not Union veterans. They were a group of singers from Fisk University, an all-Black college, who had come to serenade him, and he thanked them for the serenade, and he gave them a little speech afterwards. And he ended the speech by saying those words that the series quoted: “And I tell you now, in the closing days of this campaign, that I would rather be with you and defeated than against you and victorious.” But when the account was written up for the press by Garfield’s political team, that sentence was suppressed (Laughs.) according to his biographer. They left that out because that would cost votes. They did not wanna say to everybody—they wanted to say to the people who were there, We’ll be with you. But to everybody else, mm, maybe not. Garfield was a balancer, as political leaders so often are.\n\nAs I say, I’m not here to be Captain Buzzkill about this. I enjoyed the show; I hope you will too. But I do think we need to look back on the past with a tragic lens because we need to look at our present with a tragic lens. And understanding the past better helps us understand—and its problems, and the unsolvability and difficulty of its problems—gives us more sympathy and pity for the people who lived in the past and gives us more preparedness for our problems in the present.\n\nThanks so much for watching and listening to me this week.

Springsteen, like many who have spoken out about ICE’s activity in Minneapolis, is not buying their stories. \n\nHe names them both with the lyric, “Miller and Noem’s dirty lies.”\n\nThe track echoes his 2001 song “American Skin (41 Shots),” which he wrote to protest the NYPD shooting death of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed 23-year-old Guinean student who was shot while reaching for his wallet to show his identity.\n\nThe song comes after Springsteen spent a large part of his “Land of Hope and Dreams Tour,” which ended last year, calling Trump an “authoritarian” and “fascist.” \n\nTrump responded with a string of insults (including an AI video of himself hitting the rocker with a golf ball) as well as threats of a “major investigation” into Springsteen’s support of Kamala Harris. Springsteen never stopped calling Trump “corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous,” however, and last May, he released an EP that cemented his tour’s anti-Trump speeches into the music industry record.\n\nAnd he’s not done using his platform to call attention to Trump’s actions. He sings in detail about Pretti’s death on the new track, “Trump’s federal thugs beat up on / His face and his chest / Then we heard the gunshots.” \n\n“Alex Pretti lay in the snow, dead,” he sings, “Their claim was self-defense, sir / Just don’t believe your eyes.”\n\nSpringsteen finishes the track by singing of “glass and bloody tears,” calling attention to the targeting of “friends” whose “skin is black or brown,” and then declares, “ICE out now.”","summary":"Rodin Eckenroth / Getty Images for AFIBruce Springsteen just put out a new song called “Streets of Minneapolis” that both memorializes the protesters killed by ICE in that city and lambastes the Trump administration’s “lies.”\n\n“Two dead left to die on snow-filled streets / Alex Pretti and Renee Good,” he sings. \n\nHe also calls out “King Trump” in the brutal lyrics, slamming his “private army from the DHS” and evoking the below-freezing temperatures in the city to describe the dread he sings about: “Through the winter’s ice and cold / Down Nicollet Avenue / A city aflame fought fire and ice / ‘Neath an occupier’s boots.”\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/bruce-springsteen-releases-scathing-new-song-about-trump-and-ice/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/KBRCZFEBF5GGNFDO5E3QAU43V4.jpg?smart=true&auth=8214c2debe75a466ab83d9116cf9321e0a6980219bd2e382c3efd59c982e3c9e&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 17:58:27","author":"Eboni Boykin-Patterson","authors":["Eboni Boykin-Patterson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.291},{"id":397078922,"title":"Nicole Kidman, 58, looks VERY youthful in orange at glitzy Paris event... three weeks after finalizing Keith Urban divorce","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Jan 28th 2026\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkrainian drones wipe out $1billion worth of military aircraft in daring strikes inside Russia following Operation Spiderweb\n\nSpandau Ballet star is guilty of raping one woman and sexually assaulting and attempting to rape another\n\nTwo DHS agents put on leave over deadly Minneapolis shooting of nurse Alex Pretti\n\nStacey Solomon's 'ruthless' behaviour with Essex's mumfluencers exposed: From the Style Sisters to Mrs Hinch and now Money Mum, insiders tell 'there's only so much money to go around', her 'uncanny' habit... and reveal 'frenemy' drama\n\nA renovation left me £20,000 in debt.

A perfect way to see in 2026.'\nDonatella commented: 'I love you so so much Elton! No better way to start 2026.'\nElton has been unable to experience some of his most glitzy events over the last few months as he struggles with blindness.\nLast month, he admitted the last 15 months have been 'challenging' amid his battle with blindness.\nThe legendary musician contracted a severe eye infection in July 2024 which left him blind in his right eye, with 'limited vision' in his left.\nElton issued a new health update on his 'devastating' eye sight, admitting he hasn't been able to see, watch or read anything in over a year.\n\nThe hitmaker held hands with artist manager David, 63, as he made his arrival\n\nElton and David have been married since 2014 and together since 1993\n\nThe couple were joined by their rarely seen sons Zachary and Elijah as they celebrated the New Year in recent weeks\nHe told Variety: 'It’s been devastating. Because I lost my right eye and my left eye’s not so good, the last 15 months have been challenging for me because I haven’t been able to see anything, watch anything, read anything.\n'I’ve had the most incredible life, and there is hope. I’ve just gotta be patient that someday science will help me with this one. Once they help me with this one, I’ll be fine. It’s exactly like the AIDS situation.\n'You mustn’t give up hope, you must be stoic, you must be strong and you must always try and batter the door down to try and improve things.'\nElton added that he has been getting treatment ever since and has seen 'some improvements in his left eye'.\nRemaining positive despite his health woes, Elton previously told The Times: 'I can see you, but I can't see TV, I can't read. I can't see my boys playing rugby and soccer, and it has been a very stressful time because I'm used to soaking it all up.\n'It's distressing. You get emotional, but you have to get used to it because I'm lucky to have the life I have.'\nHe added: 'I still have my wonderful family, and I can still see something out of here [left eye] So you say to yourself, just get on with it.'\nElton also joked in the interview that his sons have now swapped Eego and Star Wars toys for an 'all-consuming love of rap'.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nElton John is aided by husband David Furnish as he heads to Valentino's Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week show\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

What We Know So Far","text":"We reported Tuesday evening about the bizarre attack on the far-left Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar (MN-5) in Minneapolis. As RedState’s Susie Moore wrote, Omar was “speaking at a town hall event there when a man approached her and appeared to spray an unknown substance at her while pointing and yelling at her.” \n\nThe man was quickly taken down by what appeared to be a security guard, and an apparently unharmed Omar initially moved toward the assailant and yelled angrily at him.\n\nThe FBI needs to launch an investigation into this incident and have Ilhan Omar file a report.If this incident is fake, Omar’s lies to the FBI would be criminal.18 U.S.C. § 1001pic.twitter.com/TlJNNeZmK8— Breanna Morello (@BreannaMorello) January 28, 2026\n\nAlthough the situation ended without serious injury, it could have been much worse – how was this apparently deranged individual able to get so close to a sitting member of the House of Representatives?\n\nSpeculation quickly spread across social media: was it staged? Was the man a far-right psycho, or a leftist freak?\n\nHere’s what we know so far. Let’s start with his name: Anthony Kazmierczak, 55. He was booked into Hennepin County Jail for third-degree assault following the incident. Although he doesn’t appear to have a previous violent record, he’s got some DUIs under his belt.\n\nKazmierczak does not appear to have ever been charged with a violent crime in Minnesota. He has twice been convicted of driving while under the influence of alcohol, according to court records reviewed by Newsweek. Court filings from a divorce case in 2017 said he has two children, was not employed and was receiving disability insurance payments. He has been married and divorced twice, CNN said, citing Minnesota’s official marriage and divorce records.\n\nMany noted he appeared to be possibly under the influence:\n\n🚨 BREAKING: The man who sprayed Ilhan Omar was some sort of liquid has been identified as 55-year-old Anthony J. Kazmierczak, per Minneapolis PDMinneapolis PD actually made an arrest for once! Imagine that. pic.twitter.com/CLSBjwbpzX— Nick Sortor (@nicksortor) January 28, 2026\n\nHe seems to have plenty of opinions:\n\nA bankruptcy petition for an Anthony Kazmierczak filed in Minnesota's third district in January 2019 showed he had credit, medical and legal debt. The filing said he was living in the Lynnhurst neighborhood of Minneapolis, not married, registered as disabled and receiving Social Security payments.A Facebook profile, reported by CNN to belong to Kazmierczak, has a history of political posts, including criticism of Democrats such as former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris. In October 2021, he posted a political cartoon criticizing Omar’s security spending.\n\nWeirdly, according to the NY Post, he hinted at his intentions to his neighbor prior to the event:\n\nThe maniac who allegedly attacked Rep. Ilhan Omar with a mystery liquid at a Minnesota town hall meeting had hinted in a cryptic text to a neighbor that he “might get arrested” at the event…“He said, ‘I’m going to this Omar thing.’ I’m like, Omar what? He said, ‘This town hall thing.’ And he said, ‘I might get arrested,’” Kelley told The Post.“I figured it was nonsense. He wasn’t going to do anything stupid. I said, ‘Sure, I’ll walk her.’ But then the next day he said, ‘Don’t worry about it, I’ve got it covered.’ I figured he blew that off.”\n\nKazmierczak is currently being held without bail. Whatever his motivations were, he is apparently going to face some stiff consequences.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy RedState’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) had one question Tuesday for President Donald Trump, who has openly admitted to feeling “even worse” that Renee Good was killed by federal immigration agents because her parents were “big Trump fans.”\n\n“What is wrong with that man?” Garcia asked during an appearance on MS NOW.\n\nGarcia had joined “The Weeknight” to discuss Trump’s fraught deployment of federal immigration agents to Minnesota when the show played a clip of Trump remarking on the fatal shootings of both Good and Alex Pretti this month.\n\n“Bottom line, it was terrible,” the president said Tuesday on Fox News of Pretti’s recent death. “Both of them were terrible; the other was terrible, too. And I’m not sure about his parents, but I know her parents were big Trump fans. Makes me feel bad anyway, but I mean, I guess you could say ‘even worse.’”\n\nTrump reiterated, “They were tremendous Trump people, Trump fans.”\n\nGood’s car was partially blocking a Minneapolis road earlier this month when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, identified as Jonathan Ross, fired multiple shots into the car, killing her. Pretti was fatally shot Saturday while filming an altercation involving Border Patrol.\n\nInitially, Trump falsely accused Good of running Ross over in an attempt to justify her death. He had a change of heart last week after learning that her parents were Trump fans, however, and said he hoped her father “still feels that way.”\n\nGarcia had some choice words about Trump’s comments.\n\n“What is wrong with that man? I mean, seriously, making this about him, always saying, now, more and more bizarre things — this is not a well person who should be the president of the United States,” he said. “And it is sick the way he reacts to tragedies, and he’s gotta be called out every single time.”\n\nGarcia added, “I just cannot believe that this is the person running our country right now.”\n\nGarcia eventually turned his attention to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who baselessly claimed after both shootings that Good and Pretti had been committing acts of “domestic terrorism” when they were killed.\n\n“One of three things is going to happen,” said Garcia. “Kristi Noem is either, A, going to resign; two, she’s going to get fired by the president in some way because of the pressure; or three, we’re going to impeach her. And so she’s better off just resigning today because we are going to launch an impeachment inquiry.”\n\nGarcia said the House oversight committee, of which he is a ranking member, will have “a significant role” in the investigation — alongside the judiciary and homeland security committees — and argued that many Republicans concerned about the midterms will be moved to cooperate.\n\n“There are, as you know, Republicans that, their districts were won by Kamala Harris. They are in districts that are essentially Democrat or Democrat-leaning districts,” he said.\n\n“And certainly, in this election, they’re going to need independents and Democrats to try to scrape their way to reelection,” Garcia added. “So I think there is a real possibility that a united Democratic caucus around impeachment could work to pick up some Republican votes.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/robert-garcia-rips-trump-reaction-alex-pretti-death_n_697a0db7e4b035e2a07a1413?origin=top-ad-recirc","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/697a392622000094b66d8c9b.jpeg?cache=spZ38zF68O&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 17:24:38","author":"Marco Margaritoff","authors":["Marco Margaritoff"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.457},{"id":397060990,"title":"House Dem Rips Trump Over Reaction To Alex Pretti Death: 'What Is Wrong With That Man?'","text":"Rep.

I mean, seriously, making this about him, always saying, now, more and more bizarre things — this is not a well person who should be the president of the United States,” he said. “And it is sick the way he reacts to tragedies, and he’s gotta be called out every single time.”\n\nGarcia added, “I just cannot believe that this is the person running our country right now.”\n\nGarcia eventually turned his attention to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who baselessly claimed after both shootings that Good and Pretti had been committing acts of “domestic terrorism” when they were killed.\n\n“One of three things is going to happen,” said Garcia. “Kristi Noem is either, A, going to resign; two, she’s going to get fired by the president in some way because of the pressure; or three, we’re going to impeach her. And so she’s better off just resigning today because we are going to launch an impeachment inquiry.”\n\nGarcia said the House oversight committee, of which he is a ranking member, will have “a significant role” in the investigation — alongside the judiciary and homeland security committees — and argued that many Republicans concerned about the midterms will be moved to cooperate.\n\n“There are, as you know, Republicans that, their districts were won by Kamala Harris. They are in districts that are essentially Democrat or Democrat-leaning districts,” he said.\n\n“And certainly, in this election, they’re going to need independents and Democrats to try to scrape their way to reelection,” Garcia added. “So I think there is a real possibility that a united Democratic caucus around impeachment could work to pick up some Republican votes.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/robert-garcia-rips-trump-reaction-alex-pretti-death_n_697a0db7e4b035e2a07a1413?origin=home-politics-feed-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/697a392622000094b66d8c9b.jpeg?cache=spZ38zF68O&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 17:24:38","author":"Marco Margaritoff","authors":["Marco Margaritoff"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.457},{"id":397057732,"title":"Katie Price's new husband's ex claims she has 'proof' Lee Andrews is a 'lying swindler' after warning her to 'run for the hills'","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nHome and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Jan 28th 2026\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkrainian drones wipe out $1bn-worth of military aircraft in daring strikes inside Russia following Operation Spiderweb\n\nSpandau Ballet star is guilty of raping one woman and sexually assaulting and attempting to rape another\n\nTwo DHS agents SUSPENDED over deadly Minneapolis shooting of nurse Alex Pretti\n\nStacey Solomon's 'ruthless' behaviour with Essex's mumfluencers exposed: From the Style Sisters to Mrs Hinch and now Money Mum, insiders tell 'there's only so much money to go around', her 'uncanny' habit... and reveal 'frenemy' drama\n\nA renovation left me £20,000 in debt.

I thought it was all a lie too until I had to find out the hard way... you want proof of everything, it's waiting for you...' and tagged Katie in the post. \nAlana also shared a photo of herself in a bikini on the beach and wrote: 'Catching flights not fiancés ❌ Somebody with your ex right now thinking they found the one @katieprice … more to come today’s news is just a warm up.\n'You guys wanted to know what he is all about?

Once I tried to leave him, he told me had a heart condition and was living on borrowed time. Lee doesn’t know what’s fact and what’s fiction.' \nMeanwhile, another of Lee's exes, Crystal Janke, has claimed Lee hoodwinked her into handing over £123,000 to invest in his company, on the promise he could get a 'return of £1million'. \nThe Sun reports the police are aware of the alleged fraud. \n\nView gallery\n\nKatie has been urged to 'run for the hills' by two of her new husband's exes, who claim the Dubai businessman is a 'lying swindler who preys on women' \n\nView gallery\n\nAlana warned Katie: 'Women look after women.

Thank you for having the courage to listen when I reached out. At the end of the day, women supporting women always wins, and I’m grateful we crossed paths for a reason.'\n'I’m sorry this happened to both of us, but we’re going to get through it- and we’ll come out on the other side stronger and empowered. \nAlana added on her Instagram Stories: 'This man had me shrinking myself making me not want to speak up, telling me not to speak to my friends about how he acted because they all told me to leave him. He even ruined some of my friendships pulled me away from people I love by protecting him.'\n'Made unlimited promises making me look as bad as him because I was on his side!! Finally I get to speak freely and tell you all, I hope Katie listens I wish I had listened to all the others that warned me! Please ladies if you experience anything like this run a mile and more. Keep running! \n\nEXCLUSIVE Katie Price's 'new husband' advertises himself on escort site for £1,000 an hour \nCrystal said she believes Lee had planned on proposing to her in the same way just two weeks before Alana's engagement after they looked at rings together. \nBut her sister began to become suspicious of Lee and contacted a private investigator, who then revealed he was dating Alana at the same time.\nCrystal said: 'The PA then found his ex Dina and she said, \"Run for the hills. He’s not who he says he is\". She said he scams people all the time.'\nCrystal swiftly ended the relationship, contacted her bank and reported Lee to police as she said: 'I know there’s no chance I’ll ever get this money back. Looking back I think, \"How did I let him scam me?\" But he was so convincing.' \nLee told the Daily Mail that he did have a relationship with Alana, stating: 'I gave her a lavish lifestyle. I invested in her real estate business. I have to dismiss all her claims.'\nHe added that he does have a heart condition but 'I have never used this as leverage as a conversation to fake anything. It's something that was bought up in conversation because I was with my partner.' \nHe added of Crystal that 'I have never met the woman' adding that he has 'exchanged conversations and a couple of texts but I do not have any notion of her investing in me or sending me money. I have to dismiss that claim.' \nThe Sun claims to have seen texts from Lee to Crystal in which he says he was 'dating a really famous person from the UK' and wants to meet her in London to return her money. \nThe Daily Mail has contacted Katie's representative for comment. \n\nThe real reason Katie Price flew to Dubai to get 'married'\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 1:41\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nView gallery\n\n Lee proposed to ex Alana just four months ago - and recreated the exact same set-up when he got down on one knee to Katie (pictured)\n\nView gallery\n\nAlana added on her Instagram Stories: 'This man had me shrinking myself making me not want to speak up'\nKatie's family have reportedly been left in the dark over her shock marriage to Lee following the pair's whirlwind 'one-week' romance.\nA source told the Daily Mail that Katie's family had not spoken to her since she walked down the aisle. \nIt is now claimed that Katie's family are deeply concerned about the speed of the relationship and are preparing to sit her down for a 'serious talk' over her marriage.\n\n Katie Price changes her name after marrying 'millionaire' Lee Andrews as she shows off £180k gift \nIt has been reported that Lee's glossy online profile supposedly caught her attention just days ago which led to the whirlwind wedding. \nThe couple, who are currently apart after Katie returned to England and Lee stayed in Dubai, have also had each other's names inked on their hands.\nSpeaking to the camera, Lee said: 'Hi guys how are you? So this is married life. There's been a bit of confusion about tattoos and rings. Rings are all on the right fingers and tattoos are all on the right hands...\n'Anyway, lots of love to everyone and massive love, all the love in the world to Katie and I'll see you soon. We had the most wonderful wedding, we are married, it is official and I'm the happiest man in the world...\n\nView gallery\n\nLee also appeared to have used the same ring - predicted to cost around £40k - to propose to the star as he used on his ex-wife Dina Taji \n'Lots of love to everyone. That might clear up a lot of the 99 per cent of the junk that's in my requests. It should. Lots of love to you all.'\nHarking back to the tattoos, he shared another video showing his hand and penned: 'So there is the tattoo, just so you can see it. Just so you know. It's further up the hand than Katie's and we are getting more tattoos.'\nFurther in his bid to silence naysayers, he then shared a video aimed further at those who claimed his ring was on the wrong hand.\nHe said: 'Folks, folks, folks. Let me just do one think for you. Listen, I'm not a videographer and I'm not a photographer but this is my left hand...\n'From where you guys are sitting because it's a reverse camera, it's the frontal camera, and you can give it a go on your iPhone or your Androids or whatever you've got, if you show your left hand to yourself on the camera with the camera facing you it will look like the right hand...\n'I can assure you myself and my beautiful wife, both have the rings on the correct finger which is the left. She also has her engagement ring which is beautiful, I love you, I love you babe, and her wedding band.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy JAMES FIELDING, SENIOR REPORTER \n Published:17:05 GMT, 28 January 2026 |Updated:17:08 GMT, 28 January 2026 \n\nThis is the neurodivergent events planner who was awarded £12,000 by a tribunal after she was 'left triggered' when her boss told her to 'stop thinking outside the box'.\nSophie Stone, 44, was admonished by her senior colleague after trying to arrange a relaxed space she could use during a work summer party in case she became overwhelmed.\nMrs Stone, who suffers from rejection sensitivity dysphoria, claimed Events Director Julie Knox told her: No thinking outside the box, get back in your box.'\nShe claimed the comment violated her 'human right to respect' because she was being instructed to 'act neurotypical and don't rock the boat.\nThe mother-of-one successfully sued her company, Kent-based MA Business Limited, for disability harassment - a type of disability discrimination - and victimisation.\nThe employment tribunal in Croydon was told that Mrs Stone began her employment with the Events team of MA Business Limited in March 2022. \nThe work was remote but there was an expectation to attend the office in Dartford for at least one day a month.\n\nView gallery\n\nSophie Stone, 44, was admonished by her senior colleague after trying to arrange a relaxed space she could use during a work summer party in case she became overwhelmed\n\nUkraine drones destroy 15 of Putin's military planes 'worth $1billion'\n\n15.3k viewing now\n\nRead texts between married teacher and boy 17 before they had sex\n\n14.2k viewing now\n\nTeen boys 'laughed' as they filmed themselves raping girls, court told\n\n7.5k viewing now\n\nThe Claimant was diagnosed with 'moderate to severe' dyslexia in 2004, which 'has more to do with information processing than with reading and writing'. \nHer 'relatively poor working memory and very slow information processing' meant she took four hours to do a task which would take her colleagues no more than two hours.\nIn December of 2022, an email was sent out to staff inviting them to the company's annual summer party on June 22.\nMrs Stone responded to the invitation on June 9 requesting that she be provided with a break-out area at the summer party in case she became overwhelmed but did not receive an answer.\nAt a Teams meeting in between her email and the party, Mrs Stone raised the fact that she had not received a reply with Events Director Mrs Knox, who told her that she shouldn't have requested it at such short notice.\nMrs Stone got talking with another neurodivergent person known as JS on the Teams call, who suggested that they were going to use their car as a safe space.\nAt the end of the meeting, Mrs Knox put a stop to a discussion about reasonable adjustments, saying that they were not 'work-related'.\nMrs Knox said that Mrs Stone and JS were discussing what they would wear and so said 'that's enough chat, let's get back to work'.\nBut Mrs Stone alleged that their boss told them they should 'stop being all outside the box'.\nThis offended Mrs Stone, who emailed another boss that her 'human right to respect had been violated'.\nShe wrote: 'My colleague suggested going and sitting in my car as a possible solution to which Julie responded, 'stop being all outside the box and get back in your boxes'.\n'I consider this direct harassment. Ridicule of my neurotype is completely unacceptable and I feel that my human right to be respected has been violated.'\nThe Tribunal also saw WhatsApp messages between Mrs Stone and her husband showing her distress at the comment.\nMrs Stone told her husband: 'I've been going over the team meeting where Julie said 'no thinking outside the box, get back in your boxes' which given that I have no choice in being outside the box is really problematic for me.\n'She is basically saying, mask, act neurotypical and don't rock the boat.'\nThe incident was looked into in a grievance procedure, but JS said Mrs Knox's version of events were correct and that she didn't remember making the comment.\nShe said: 'Never was a sentence said to me using derogative words such as 'in your box' or 'in your lane'. And certainly not from Julie.'\nBut the Employment Tribunal found that this comment did in fact take place and that it was 'unwanted conduct' - even saying it added 'far less weight' to JS's evidence because they did not attend the Tribunal.\nEmployment Judge Kathryn Ramsden said: 'We found that Mrs Knox said something like 'get back in your work box', attempting to switch (Mrs Stone's) mindset from being focused on the summer party and adjustments related to that, and back to the workload in front of her.\n'In doing so we have given far less weight to JS's apparent account, as whilst we heard evidence from Mr Allen that that is what JS said, we have not been able to question JS about it.\n'Moreover, (Mrs Stone) tells us that JS's first language is not English, and so the connotations of 'getting back in the box' for a neurodivergent person might not be picked up on by a person whose first language is not English, and so might not be remembered by them two months after the meeting.'\n\nView gallery\n\nThe neurodivergent events planner who was awarded £12,000 by a tribunal after she was 'left triggered' when her boss told her to 'stop thinking outside the box'.\nShe continued: 'We have found that Mrs Knox said to Mrs Stone and JS words along the lines of 'get back in your work box'.\n'This was unwanted conduct - it clearly distressed her greatly, as shown by her WhatsApp to her husband when she was still thinking about, and was very distressed about, it two days later.\n'It did relate to disability - Mrs Knox was trying to get Mrs Stone and JS to stop talking about reasonable adjustments for the summer party, and switch back into 'work mode'.'\nThe judge added: 'We find that Mrs Knox's purpose was very far from seeking to violate (Mrs Stone's) dignity, or create an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for her - it was to try and get her, and JS, to get on with their work, and to bring the team meeting to a close to enable others to do so as well.\n'However, we do find that it had the proscribed effect. (Mrs Stone) is neurodivergent and, she says, has rejection sensitivity dysphoria. Being effectively told that she was 'outside the box' in discussing reasonable adjustments was understandably triggering for her.'\nMrs Stone, who lives in Worthing, West Sussex, won a claim of disability harassment related to the comments.\nShe also won claims of failure to make reasonable adjustments - which is disability discrimination - over a failure to help her with software and victimisation over an email.\nShe was awarded £12,000 by the Tribunal. Further claims were dismissed.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nPictured: Events planner with 'rejection sensitivity' who won £12,000 for being 'triggered' when her boss told her to 'get back in your box'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (47)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nAdA different place, Derbyshire, United Kingdom, moments ago\n\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\n\nYour job is tgere so you can earn (Note: EARN) money.

The legislature claimed it did so by passing the measure on Oct. 31, 2025, before the 2025 elections, and again earlier this month once the new state House of Delegates had been seated, but the judge found that because early voting for the 2025 elections had been ongoing since Sept. 19, 2025, the requirement was not met.\n\n“The Constitution requires an intervening election following the first passage of a proposed Constitutional Amendment. It is legal, acceptable and even encouraged for voters to take advantage of the earlier voting statute. There is no rational conclusion except that the election began on the first day of voting (September 19, 2025) and ended on November 4, 2025,” the ruling said.\n\n“Therefore, the Court finds that following the October 31, 2025 vote and passage of House Joint Resolution 6007 there has not been an ensuing general election of the House of Delegates, and such ensuing general election cannot occur until 2027,” Hurley’s ruling continued.\n\nHurley also found that the state legislature failed to comply with a Virginia law that requires the proposed ballot measure to be posted on the front door of every courthouse and published by the House clerk three months before the next state House election.\n\n“Defendants woefully argued that the posting could occur three (3) months prior to the 2027 election and still comply with the statute even if the proposed Constitutional Amendment was voted on in the Spring of 2026,” Hurley said.\n\n“The sole purpose for the posting [of] the proposed amendment at the front door of the Courthouse and having a copy in the Clerk’s Office available for inspection is to provide the voters with notice and information prior to the election of the House of Delegates members who would be elected to vote on the proposed Constitutional Amendment for the second vote as required under the Constitution,” he added.\n\nHurley additionally found the October 2025 vote was an invalid expansion of the 2024 special legislative session’s business, but he did find that Democrats’ reconvening of the 2024 special session in October 2025 was legally valid.\n\nWith Hurley’s ruling, the proposed ballot measure could have to be voted on by the state legislature again in January 2028 at the earliest — after the next scheduled state House elections in November 2027. If the ballot measure were then approved sometime after a successful second vote, the earliest it could be implemented would be in the 2028 elections.\n\nVirginia Democrats, emboldened by sweeping victories in the commonwealth’s 2025 elections, set their sights on redrawing the state’s congressional map as part of the redistricting battle between Republicans and Democrats across the country ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe current Virginia delegation to Congress includes six Democrats and five Republicans, for a state that voted 51.8% to 46.1% for then-President Kamala Harris over President Donald Trump in the 2024 election. Virginia Democrats have teased redrawing the commonwealth’s congressional map to have a 10-1 or 9-2 Democrat advantage, after Texas and California authorized similar partisan redesigns.\n\nCRIME, GUNS, AND TAXES: DEMOCRATS SEEK TO RESHAPE VIRGINIA MOMENTS AFTER TAKING POWER\n\nBecause Virginia has a constitutionally mandated independent commission to draw its congressional map, a partisan gerrymander requires a constitutional amendment via a ballot measure to be instituted, similar to California.\n\nDemocrats in Virginia had been eyeing an April referendum for the new congressional map, but with Tuesday’s ruling, that election could be off the table.","summary":"A Virginia judge has halted Democratic efforts to hold a referendum in April to redraw the commonwealth’s congressional maps ahead of the 2026 elections. Judge Jack Hurley of the Tazewell County Circuit Court ruled on Tuesday that the Democrat-led Virginia legislature failed to follow multiple procedures required to place the redistricting measure on the ballot.
