Polling has shown that November's contest will likely look similar, with several surveys in the last few weeks finding this year's presidential candidates tied in the Badget State.According to a survey by Napolitan News released on Thursday, Harris is up by Trump by just one percentage point (50 percent to 49 percent) among 788 likely voters in Wisconsin. Given the poll's margin of error of 3.5 percent, however, the candidates are considered to be in a statistical tie.A separate survey from Rasmussen Reports and American Thinker, conducted between September 19 and 22, found the 2024 candidates tied at 49 percent, according to the responses of 1,071 likely voters in Wisconsin. As American Thinker managing editor Andrea Widburg noted in a report that accompanied the poll on Wednesday, the candidates are stuck neck-and-neck largely because of \"the four issues that concern Wisconsin voters: the economy, immigration, energy policy, and abortion.\"\"On the first two, a majority of voters believe that Trump is the stronger candidate; on the last two, a slight majority side with Harris on energy issues, while those who support Harris are also strongly pro-abortion,\" Widburg added.Polling released last week told a similar story in Wisconsin. In a survey from Emerson College and The Hill between September 15 and 18, Trump was up by just 1 percentage point (49 percent to 48 percent), according to the responses of 1,000 likely voters. In another survey from MaristPoll conducted that same week, Harris was up by 1 point (50 percent to 49 percent), according to a sample size of 1,194 voters.Averages compiled by RealClearPolling (RCP) show that Harris holds just a 0.7 percentage point lead in Wisconsin. The state's contest has remained incredibly close since Harris launched her campaign. According to RCP's records, the largest gap between the candidates was late last month, when Harris was leading Trump on average by 1.9 percentage points (49 percent to 47.1 percent) as of August 29.The New York Times polling tracker gives Harris a bit more of a gap with less than six weeks until Election Day, finding that the vice president is ahead by 2 percentage points on average in Wisconsin as of Thursday.Two major election forecasts also give Harris a higher chance of winning Wisconsin. Pollster Nate Silver predicts that the vice president has a 61 percent of securing the Badger State and its 10 electoral votes, while Trump was given a 39 percent chance as of Thursday. FiveThirtyEight's model gave Harris almost identical odds (62 percent chance to Trump's 38 percent chance).Newsweek reached out to the Harris and Trump campaigns for comment on Thursday.","summary":"Recent polling has found Trump and Harris caught neck-and-neck in the battle for the Badger State.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-chances-beating-kamala-harris-wisconsin-poll-1960157","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2481861/trumps-chances-beating-harris-wisconsin.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 00:55:09","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.602},{"id":257568764,"title":"In a US presidential election this close, could the outcome be swayed by two scandals — or the 'blue dot'?","text":"Local government jobs don't get much more high profile than the one held by the person elected to lead New York City. So when the mayor of America's biggest metropolis was charged with taking illegal campaign contributions from foreign nationals this week, the political shock waves were felt far beyond Manhattan. Democrat Eric Adams has been accused of five federal offences, including bribery and wire fraud. Prosecutors allege he abused his position by soliciting the campaign donations, and by accepting bribes from Turkish nationals in the form of luxury travel and accommodation. In exchange, he's accused of pressuring the city's fire department to allow the opening of a new Turkish consular building, without the need to pass a safety inspection. The mayor insists he's innocent of the charges and won't be stepping down from his position. He's also hit out at federal prosecutors, appearing to take a leaf out of former US president Donald Trump's playbook by suggesting he's being targeted for political reasons — in his case, for criticising the Biden administration over its immigration policies. \"I always knew that if I stood my ground for all of you, that I would be a target, and a target I became,\" he said in a video message. \"Despite our pleas, when the federal government did nothing as its broken immigration policies overloaded our shelter system with no relief, I put the people of New York before party and politics.\" Adams fell out with President Joe Biden, a fellow Democrat, amid accusations the federal government had not provided New York with enough support to deal with an increase in the number of asylum seekers arriving in the city. The White House would not comment on the mayor's indictment, other than to insist the Department of Justice (DOJ) was not influenced by political factors. \"The president was clear, even when he was running in 2020, that he was going to make sure that DOJ is independent,\" press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. \"DOJ is handling this case independently. I'm not going to go beyond that.\" New York is considered reliably safe for Democrats in the presidential race, meaning the mayor's legal woes are not expected to affect Vice-President Kamala Harris's chances of winning there. But the state could play an important role in deciding which party takes control of the House of Representatives after the election, and the ability of the new president to implement their legislative agenda. Several Democratic candidates vying for House seats are already calling on Adams to resign. But the state's Democratic Governor, Kathy Hochul, who has the power to sack him, has indicated she's still weighing her options. Trump, meanwhile, used the saga to try to further his own argument that he'd also been the target of political prosecutions. \"I wish him luck,\" he said of the mayor. Trouble for Trump in North Carolina? Trump is facing a more difficult political situation in North Carolina, where the Republican candidate for governor has become mired in scandal. Mark Robinson currently serves as lieutenant governor — the state's second highest elected official — and was endorsed by the former president in his bid for the top job. Trump had previously been full of praise for the 56-year-old, describing him as \"unbelievable\" and \"one of the great stars of the party\". But Robinson's campaign has been in crisis mode since CNN reported allegations that he'd made offensive and inflammatory comments on a pornography website's message board a decade prior, including one in which he allegedly referred to himself as a \"black Nazi\". Robinson has denied the claims, and the ABC has not independently verified them. Kamala Harris's team seized on the news though, releasing a new ad highlighting the former president's previous support for the lieutenant governor. And when Trump held a rally in North Carolina in the aftermath of the story being published, Robinson did not make an appearance or get a mention. Democrats haven't won the state in a presidential election since Barack Obama flipped it in 2008. But Trump claimed victory in North Carolina with only a very slim margin in 2020, and Kamala Harris's team is hopeful the vice-president could pick it up. The governor's race does not technically affect the presidential contest. Voters in North Carolina are free to choose candidates from different parties for each of the positions being decided. The risk for Trump is that Harris's effort to link him to yet more controversy succeeds in swaying people against him in what's expected to be a very tight race. In case you missed it: The little blue dot at the centre of a big fight Less than six weeks out from election day, the two major party candidates are focusing most of their time and money on the seven 'swing states' considered up for grabs by either side. The aforementioned North Carolina is one of them, along with Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. But a voting peculiarity has made the Midwestern state of Nebraska also one to watch. Most states have a 'winner takes all' approach under the electoral college system that decides the presidency. If a candidate receives the majority of ballots cast in Pennsylvania, for example, they pick up all of the state's 19 electoral college votes. Nebraska's process for allocating its five electoral college votes is more complicated. The candidate with the most support overall gets two votes, while the remaining three are awarded based on the results in each of its congressional districts. Trump won four of Nebraska's five votes in 2020, but lost the district which takes in the more liberal-leaning city of Omaha to Biden. Depending on how all of the swing states end up falling, there's a scenario in which the so-called \"blue dot\" could get Harris to the magic number of 270 votes needed to enter the White House. Republicans have recently tried to change the voting rules in Nebraska to a winner takes all model, without success. It means the small blue dot in the middle of the country could be front and centre come November 5. Loading","summary":"Election day on November 5 is shaping up to be an extremely tight race.

His endorsement wasn’t enough for her to secure the Democratic nomination alone, but to her credit, she managed to get her candidacy formally approved by the party. This showed that the party was solidly behind her, marking her rise as a political leader in her own right. She could have been tied to the Biden administration’s failures and held equally responsible, just like her boss. This would have made Republican nominee and former president Donald Trump’s job easier, but politics rarely follows predictable lines. Small wonder that politics is often called the art of the possible. Trump wasn’t eager to debate Harris, knowing his loquaciousness wouldn’t substitute for sound arguments. He also feared her legal background would allow her to question him with clinical precision. When the first debate finally happened, Trump found himself in trouble as Harris gained the upper hand throughout, preventing him from effectively highlighting her party’s and government’s shortcomings. Few believed Trump would face her again after the thrashing he received. His decision to forgo further debates surprised no one. However, the nationally televised debates—watched by tens of millions worldwide—have long been a hallmark of presidential contests, giving voters and observers a chance to assess the contenders. By opting out, Trump has left himself vulnerable to mockery on social media. That said, presidential debates, however glamorous and hallowed they might have been, have never been the clincher. Trump still retains support from his party and those who believe the Democratic president squandered an opportunity to restore America to its former glory.

(Photo by Erika Goldring/Getty Images) Getty Images Chappell Roan has again pushed back against the expectations of her fanbase, as the outspoken star declined to endorse Kamala Harris for president, but revealed she would be voting for her. Tension is rising as the deadline to the U.S. election draws nearer, and pop fans have been pressuring their favorite stars to back their preferred candidate—superstar Taylor Swift previously faced a wave of backlash for staying silent, before succumbing to the pressure and posting an enthusiastic endorsement for Kamala Harris on Instagram. Swifties got the endorsement they wanted from the massively influential pop star, but Chappell Roan has repeatedly refused to cater to her fanbase, shining a spotlight on the intense expectations and demands of fame. Chappell Roan’s Endorsement Controversy, Explained Fans took offense after Roan told The Guardian that she would not be endorsing a political candidate, stating: “I have so many issues with our government in every way. There are so many things that I would want to change. So I don’t feel pressured to endorse someone. There’s problems on both sides. I encourage people to use your critical thinking skills, use your vote – vote small, vote for what’s going on in your city.” In the same interview, Roan made it clear that she supports the LGBTQ community, highlighting “trans rights” as the biggest change she wanted to see in the US this election year. “They cannot have cis people making decisions for trans people, period,” she said. Roan’s reasoning was fairly articulate, but the “both sides” quote went viral after being plucked out of the interview and posted across multiple pop culture accounts, devoid of context. The quote sparked fierce backlash from fans and LGBTQ activists terrified of living under another Trump presidency, with many labeling Roan as a “privileged” centrist, insulated by her newfound wealth and fame. Roan took to TikTok to explain her reasoning and repeated her full quote, to ensure the context wasn’t lost in the noise. Roan asked fans to use their \"critical thinking skills\" and stated her intent to be \"part of a generation that changes things for good.\" She concluded her video by clarifying that she would not be voting for Donald Trump, and simply wanted to question those in power. The video, however, seemed to intensify the backlash. Hence, Roan followed up with a second TikTok, seemingly frustrated that her point was being missed. In the video, Roan emphasized that she was not happy with many of the Democratic policies on the left concerning trans rights, Palestine and “every marginalized community in the world.” “There is no way I can stand behind some of the left’s completely transphobic and completely genocidal views,” she said. Roan went on to clarify, “This is not me playing both sides. This is me questioning both sides because this is what we have in front of us.” Roan concluded by telling her fans to vote for “who in your mind is the best option” and pleaded with her viewers not to “settle for what we have.” The backlash didn’t stop, but Roan’s clarification sparked a fierce debate about progressive values and the political weaponization of queer identity. Some commentators pointed out that Roan’s reasoning had been perfectly clear, and proposed that the best course of action would be to move on. Heated discourse over a political endorsement from a pop star highlights the shifting relations between fans and celebrities, with modern fandoms demanding not just relatability, but political action from their favorite stars. Chappell Roan Previously Pushed Back Against Fan’s Expectations Roan is no stranger to the concept of fans crossing boundaries; indeed, the singer has been refreshingly candid about the bitter realities of fame, opening up about the negative effect on her mental health and pushing back against the entitlement of obsessive fans. While many celebrities seek to kindle parasocial relationships with their fans and strengthen the illusion of intimacy, Roan has bluntly told her fanbase that she is a complete stranger to them; fans only know the persona, not the person. In a pair of TikToks that went viral in August, Roan told her most obsessive fans: “I don’t care that abuse and harassment, stalking, whatever, is a normal thing to do to people who are famous or a little famous. I don’t care that it’s normal; I don’t care that this crazy type of behavior comes along with the job, this career field that I’ve chosen. That does not make it okay. That does not make it normal.” Roan followed up by reminding her fans that they do not know her, even if they think they do. “It’s weird how people think that you know a person just ’cause you see them online or you listen to the art they make,” she said. “That’s f**king weird. I’m allowed to say no to creepy behavior, okay?” MORE FROM FORBES ForbesThe Blake Lively Backlash On TikTok, ExplainedBy Dani Di PlacidoForbesGuillermo Del Toro Strikes Back Against AI-Generated ArtBy Dani Di PlacidoForbesSydney Sweeney’s Reaction To AI-Generated Portrait Goes ViralBy Dani Di PlacidoForbesDisney’s ‘Inside Out 2’ Controversy, ExplainedBy Dani Di Placido Follow me on Twitter.

During talks with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, US leader Joe Biden discussed diplomatic, economic and military aspects of the Kiev government’s proposed peace plan, the White House press service said in a statement. \"President Biden outlined his decision to surge U.S. security assistance to Ukraine, and President Zelensky presented his plan to achieve victory over Russia. The two leaders discussed the diplomatic, economic, and military aspects of President Zelensky’s plan and tasked their teams to engage in intensive consultations regarding next steps,\" the document says. \"On October 12, 2024, President Biden will host a leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany, where the two leaders will review progress on these consultations and coordinate with international partners on additional assistance for Ukraine. President Biden is determined to provide Ukraine with the support it needs to win,\" it says. Earlier, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said he had prepared a conflict resolution plan that he intends to discuss with US President Joe Biden as some provisions depended on Washington’s decisions. He also plans to present it to the US presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Later, Sergey Leshchenko, an adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, said the plan is based on the assumption that the Western countries will approve strikes deep into Russian territory. As Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out, Ukraine is unable to strike deep into Russian territory without Western assistance, as it needs intelligence from satellites and flight tasks to do so. At the same time, the Ukrainian leader also named the ‘victory plan,’ based on his ‘peace formula’ as a possible way of resolving the crisis. Moscow has repeatedly criticized it for being unrealistic, saying that the situation on the ground must be taken into account. Besides, Moscow voiced its support for the peace plan, proposed by China and Brazil, which Ukraine rejected as ‘unrealistic.’ Russian President Vladimir Putin set forth the conditions for resolving the situation in Ukraine at a meeting with senior Foreign Ministry officials on June 14. His terms included Ukraine withdrawing troops from Donbass and Novorossia and abandoning plans to join NATO. In addition, Moscow believes that all Western sanctions must be lifted and Ukraine’s non-bloc and non-nuclear status must be guaranteed. Putin noted that if Ukraine and the West turned down the initiative, the conditions might change in the future. Kiev rejected Russia’s peace plan.","summary":"The two leaders \"tasked their teams to engage in intensive consultations regarding next steps,\" the White House press service said in a statement","url":"https://tass.com/world/1848475","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 00:19:00","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.012},{"id":257566746,"title":"Kyodo News Digest: Sept. 27, 2024","text":"The following is the latest list of selected news summaries by Kyodo News. ---------- TOKYO - Japan's ruling party will select a new leader on Friday to succeed Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, aiming to restore voter confidence shaken by a slush funds scandal, in an unprecedentedly crowded and closely contested race. Former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Shinjiro Koizumi, the youngest candidate for the Liberal Democratic Party, and economic security minister Sanae Takaichi are pulling ahead of the other six contenders, according to a Kyodo News tally and analysis. ---------- SHIZUOKA, Japan - A Japanese court acquitted Thursday an 88-year-old former professional boxer in a high-profile retrial decades after he was sentenced to death over a 1966 quadruple murder, saying investigators had fabricated evidence. Iwao Hakamata spent nearly half a century on death row before new evidence led to his release from incarceration in 2014, leading to his being recognized that year as the world's longest-serving death row prisoner. ---------- Acquittal in 1966 quadruple murder praised, retrial reform call grows SHIZUOKA, Japan - Supporters of the 88-year-old man who spent nearly half a century on death row over a 1966 quadruple murder praised Thursday's ruling resulting in his acquittal, while legislators and lawyers stepped up calls to reform the country's lengthy retrial process. \"The ruling was enough to make prosecutors feel they cannot argue any further,\" said Hideyo Ogawa, one of the lawyers for Iwao Hakamata, following the Shizuoka District Court's decision that said investigators fabricated evidence that played a key role in his conviction. ---------- Harris says aid for Ukraine in U.S. strategic interest, not charity WASHINGTON - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday pledged \"unwavering\" support for Ukraine, noting it is in \"our strategic interest\" and not charity. Harris, the Democratic nominee for the presidential election in November, told the press she will continue to work toward making sure Ukraine prevails in its war with Russia, before she was briefed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on a \"victory plan\" during their meeting in Washington. ---------- Toyota says it will end Olympic, Paralympic sponsorship deal in Dec. NAGOYA - Toyota Motor Corp. confirmed Thursday it will not renew its top-tier sponsorship contract with the International Olympic Committee at the end of the year. Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda announced the decision via the Japanese automaker's media channel, while raising doubts about whether athletes are being put first in the Olympics. ---------- TOKYO - The detachment of two linked Shinkansen trains while traveling at high speed last week was likely due to a malfunction in a coupling switch, with metal fragments found behind it possibly playing a role, railway operator JR East said Thursday. The Komachi and Hayabusa high-speed trains on the Tohoku Shinkansen Line uncoupled on Sept. 19 between Furukawa and Sendai stations in Miyagi Prefecture, northeastern Japan. The Tokyo-bound trains subsequently made an emergency stop, but no injuries were reported and none of the cars derailed. ---------- New York mayor indicted over corruption allegations NEW YORK - U.S. federal prosecutors said Thursday they have indicted New York Mayor Eric Adams on corruption charges, including taking bribes and conspiring to obtain money from foreign benefactors for the mayoral election campaign in 2021. Adams, 64, became the first sitting leader of the most populous city in the United States to be indicted on criminal charges. He has denied the allegations, telling an event the same day, \"My day-to-day will not change. I will continue to do the job for 8.3 million New Yorkers.\" ---------- TOKYO - Host country favorite Kei Nishikori rolled back the years with a vintage performance to beat Croatia's Marin Cilic 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the first round at the Japan Open tennis championships Thursday.

Trump, the Republican candidate in the Nov 5 presidential election, made the announcement on Thursday, just hours after Democratic President Joe Biden announced more than $8 billion in new military aid for the U.S. ally. Zelenskyy has long sought a meeting with Trump. The two men spoke by phone in July but have not met in person since Trump's term as president ended in 2021. During a press conference on Thursday, Trump repeated his claims that he could rapidly negotiate a deal between Russia and Ukraine if he defeats Biden's vice president, Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate in the race for the White House. \"President Zelenskyy has asked to meet with me, and I will be meeting with him tomorrow morning at around 9:45 in Trump Tower\" in New York, Trump said. Asked by a reporter if Ukraine might have to give up any of its territory to reach a peace deal with Moscow - a non-starter for Kyiv - Trump did not rule it out. \"We'll see what happens,\" he said. Shortly before Trump's comments, Harris pledged support for Ukraine and - in a veiled reference to Trump - said those who would have Ukraine swap land for peace with Russia were supporting \"proposals of surrender.\" Harris was speaking alongside Zelenskyy at the White House, a day after Trump assailed him for not making a deal with Russia that Trump said could have ended the war and shortly after the White House announcement of the new aid package. It was Harris' seventh meeting with Zelenskyy and the third this year. Earlier in the week, Trump looked poised to reject Zelenskyy's meeting request. The Ukrainian leader had said before departing for New York for the annual U.N. General Assembly that he hoped to present his \"victory plan\" to win the war with Russia to Harris, Trump and Biden. But he upset Trump's campaign after visiting a munitions factory over the weekend in the battleground state of Pennsylvania with that state's governor, Josh Shapiro, a Democrat and a Harris ally. Trump has stood by his criticisms of Zelenskyy on the campaign trail. He said on Monday that Zelenskyy wanted Harris to win the election, and on Wednesday he called the Eastern European nation \"dead\" and \"demolished.\" The U.S aid announced by Biden includes the first shipment of a precision-guided glide bomb called the Joint Standoff Weapon, with a range of up to 81 miles (130 km). The medium-range missile gives Ukraine a major upgrade to the weapons it is using to strike Russian forces, allowing the Ukrainians to do it at safer distances. The bulk of the new aid, $5.5 billion, is to be allocated before Monday's end of the U.S. fiscal year, when the funding authority is set to expire. Another $2.4 billion is under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which allows the administration to buy weapons for Ukraine from companies rather than pull them from U.S. stocks. Biden also said he would order the Pentagon to expand training of Ukrainian F-16 pilots, including by supporting the training of an additional 18 pilots next year. Zelenskyy thanked Biden and the U.S. Congress for the new military aid package, saying Ukraine would use it \"in the most efficient and transparent manner\". \"I am grateful to the United States for providing the items that are most critical to protecting our people,\" Zelenskyy said on X, mentioning a Patriot battery, drones and long-range missiles. © Thomson Reuters 2024.","summary":"Donald Trump said he would meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday, having criticized him on the U.S. campaign trail and expressed doubts about Ukraine's ability to win…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/trump-to-meet-ukraine%27s-zelenskiy-after-harris-pledges-support","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/df/69/870e189317254563e2788e560b581dd257b8/tagreuters/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 00:10:39","author":"Gram Slattery,Japan Today Editor","authors":["Gram Slattery","Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.188},{"id":257566782,"title":"Zelenskyy visits Washington as election year  divide grows over Ukraine war","text":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy huddled with U.S. leaders today [Macau time] to shore up American support for his country’s fight against Russia as the war faces a partisan reckoning in this year’s presidential election.

She’ll have her own meeting with Zelenskyy after the Ukrainian leader sits down with President Joe Biden, who announced billions of dollars more in missiles, drones, ammunition and other supplies. “The United States will provide Ukraine with the support it needs to win this war,” Biden said in a statement, pledging to ensure that all approved funding is disbursed before he leaves office. He also said he would convene a meeting with other world leaders focused on Ukraine’s defense during a visit to Germany next month. Before arriving at the White House, Zelenskyy headed to Capitol Hill to meet with lawmakers from both parties.

The meeting will be held at Trump Tower. (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images Key Facts The meeting will take place around 9:45 a.m. EDT, according to Trump, who told reporters he will be able to strike a deal between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky “quite quickly” to end the war in Ukraine, though he refused to provide details on what the compromise would look like. Trump and Zelensky’s relationship appears rocky ahead of the meeting, as the two have traded barbs recently that included a criticism from Zelensky, who recently told The New Yorker, “Trump doesn’t really know how to stop the war even if he might think he knows.” A reporter asked Trump about Zelensky’s comment, to which the former president joked that he should “immediately cancel” the upcoming meeting before insisting Zelensky knows he understands how to end the war. The meeting will be hosted just a few days after Trump expressed doubt about Ukraine’s chances of winning the war and called Zelensky “the greatest salesman on Earth,” referring to the tens of billions of dollars in aid the U.S. has provided Ukraine since 2022. Trump said the war between Ukraine and Russia “never would have happened” if he were president, repeating a claim he has made several times when asked about the subject.

Tangent Zelensky received the ire of Republicans who recently criticized him for visiting a Scranton, Pennsylvania, artillery manufacturing plant and claimed his visit was “a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats.” Key Background Trump and Zelensky's bumpy relationship may partially be rooted in the former president’s comments about ending the Ukraine-Russia war, as opposed to pledging his support for a Ukrainian victory, though Trump’s relationship with the Ukrainian president dates back years, with a controversial 2019 phone call between the two, in which Trump urged Zelensky to investigate then-Democratic candidate Joe Biden, serving as a focal point for a Democratic impeachment inquiry into Trump. The former president was later impeached by the House, before being acquitted in a Senate trial. Trump has not provided details about his plan to end the war, which has carried on for more than two years. Zelensky met with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday following Biden’s pledge to provide an additional $8 billion in aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia.

The third time’s a charm for Future as he returned with his guest-less Mixtape Pluto album last week, which leads the discussion surrounding the new episode of Billboard Unfiltered. Future is angling for his third No. 1 album of 2024 and his eighth consecutive leader on the Billboard 200. For staff writer Kyle Denis, there’s never enough Future in his life. “Never too much Future for me, to be honest,” he said. “‘Told My’ is my favorite song. ‘I told my b—h if I gotta be faithful, I might fall off.’ That’s a bar.” Denis continued: “That’s gonna be something I live by for the next eight months or so until the next tape drops maybe. I had a great time with the Future record. I just feel like he never lets me down in terms of giving me a collection of solid tracks that I like to bump for the next couple of months.” Deputy Director, Editorial Damien Scott lent his stamp of approval to the project. “I love the album, I think it’s great. I also love the other two albums he dropped. There’s only so many hours I could devote to Future. I can’t play him around my kids,” Scott admitted. “It’s not like too much Future, but you could’ve held off on this while we’re still enjoying this other album that still has legs.” He added: “He’s great at making the story. He’s great at furthering the narrative. Everything we’ve learned about Future is through The Shade Room, which is hilarious because we don’t learn much from his music about him, but he’s able to continue this narrative that we all buy into album after album.” Over the weekend, Janet Jackson made headlines when she told The Guardian that presidential candidate Kamala Harris is “not black” and she “heard that she’s Indian.” She faced plenty of backlash on social media over the false claims. Guest anchor and senior producer Tetris Kelly chalked this up to being a classic case of misinformation being spread. “No matter how famous you are, she’s still an auntie,” he said. “That’s the way I look at it. That’s your Black auntie that be at the cookout that be like, ‘Yeah, I saw on Facebook.’ We talk about misinformation and that’s kind of how it works.” Kyle Denis took a different approach expecting more from Ms. Jackson. “I’m expecting her to be a knowledgable person because she’s a voting citizen who’s grown.” The discussion took a turn when breaking down Chloe Bailey’s solo career as the fellas gave her advice on how she could capitalize on her talents and fully blossom into a star. “I think she would do well with an editor or an executive producer to streamline the visions that she has that feel too much on a single song let alone an entire album,” Denis said. “She probably does have too much freedom. Sometimes you need to hone it in.” Denis thinks there needs to be a realignment for Chloe’s branding so she could reap the benefits like we saw with Sabrina Carpenter and her Short ‘n Sweet summer of dominance. “When I think of the name Chloe Bailey, a lot of things come to mind, but they’re not really a uniform brand of what Chloe Bailey is or represents,” he continued. “Half the reason people were so into the Sabrina Carpenter arc this year was how well she branded herself across those singles aesthetically, style-wise all that stuff. There’s a disconnect there on that level with Chloe.” Damien Scott wants to see her hit the studio with a sonic savant like the Grammy-winning Darkchild to help steer her next era’s direction. “I think there could be a lot of success had if she were to sit down with somebody we all threw out Darkchild. I think she needs a direction. The way that Darkchild talked about working with Brandy, that’s the type of work she needs,” he said. “What are you really trying to say? Let’s find some sounds that match that. Let’s find some themes that match that.” Watch the full episode below.","summary":"Pluto is looking to notch his third album atop the Billboard 200 this year.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/billboard-unfiltered-futures-run-chloe-baileys-solo-career-janet-jacksons-kamala-harris-comments-1235786067/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/future-press-credit-Matt-Adam-2024-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 00:02:47","author":"Michael Saponara","authors":["Michael Saponara"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.297},{"id":257566396,"title":"Google is biased in favor of Democrats ahead of 2024 election","text":"While Congressional Republicans were hammering Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey for censoring conservatives on their platforms, Google’s executives sat back smugly, confident that their obscene censorship schemes went undetected. But our organization, the Media Research Center, and others have shown that Google is the most effective weapon in the left’s arsenal — the one that gets its candidates across the finish line. In the last presidential election, Google swayed anywhere from six to eight million votes in favor of Joe Biden. MRC’s studies over a 12-month period consistently showed that Google completely buried Republican campaign websites in favor of their Democrat opponents. During the presidential primary contests, MRC conducted studies searching for the campaign websites for both Democrats and Republicans. Not surprisingly, when MRC searched for “democrat presidential campaign websites,” Biden’s campaign site was always the first or second search result. But the results were very different when searching for the Republican campaign websites. Shockingly, Google only produced a total of two sites: one for Democrat Marianne Williamson and another for Will Hurd, a little-known Congressman who never polled above 1%. Google would not produce the campaign websites for Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy or the other eleven candidates. Because the world now knows Google’s methods and motivations, the search titan has changed its tactics. In our latest study, we show that Google is finally revealing Trump’s website, albeit, still lower than Harris’. But a user is now required to wade through a flood of news articles, almost all hostile to Trump, before ever reaching either candidate’s website. For example, Google highlighted a pro-Kamala Harris article in The Economist four search results above Trump’s website. Instead of addressing the policies of the two candidates, The Economist noted Trump’s “dismal record” of scandals and legal battles, while touting Harris’s young age. In another example, The Washington Post’s live update page included articles with headlines like “Trump’s sudden move to re-litigate sexual abuse claims goes off the rails.” Predictably, above the link to Harris’s website were puff pieces touting optimistic predictions of a presidential win that simultaneously hid her actual policy positions. Congressional Republicans and several state Attorneys General understand that Google is weaponized against Republicans and uses its corporate resources to help Democrats. It is not illegal for a corporation to use its resources to influence the outcome of an election. But it is against the law when a corporation does not disclose its efforts with the Federal Election Commission. Google is either illegally coordinating with the Harris campaign, or if its expenditures are independent, it is unlawfully failing to file its disclosure reports. Congress should find out which it is.

The Post reported that Vice President Kamala Harris will be the first presidential candidate in 40 years to not attend the Al Smith dinner (“Who’s running this place? Sure not Joe,” Miranda Devine,” Sept. 23). Devine says it is because Harris lacks competence at impromptu events. And as a practicing Catholic, I find her absence from the dinner and her general attitude toward the Catholic religion to both be completely offensive.Pope Francis recently encouraged Catholics to vote for the lesser of the two evils. Therefore, I will not be voting for Harris. I urge all Catholics to follow my lead. Rich LePetri Naples, Fla. The dinner is just a night of political jokes, as it has always been. Harris will need to learn to face the music — there will be worst confrontations than this if she’s elected. J.R. Cummings Manhattan Harris, who claims that she wants to be a president for all Americans, has chosen to skip this year’s historic Al Smith dinner. Perhaps it’s because her infamous “word salad” is not on the menu? Anne Marie Marsala Garden City Kudos to the Editorial Board for admonishing the Democratic presidential nominee for failing to attend a worthy cause such as the Al Smith dinner (“Why Harris Is Dissing Al Smith,” Sept. 23). Let’s face it — former President Donald Trump might have enjoyed an enviable array of Harris’ brilliant comments to mock. Trump’s potential “Kamala-logue” could cover falling out of a coconut tree, her love of school buses and Venn diagrams, along with her brilliant explanation of the passage of time. In case Harris loses the race, I thought that, while in Manhattan, she might have harnessed her mighty cackle (and truly explore what can be unburdened by what has been) to audition for a role as a late-night host at NBC or CBS. She’s a true comedian, after all. Michael P. Mulhall Moseley, Va. Regarding Piers Morgan’s article, “Oh, Kam on, you coward!” (Sept. 24): Trump is not a plagiarizer, but he should use Morgan’s suggestions for the Al Smith dinner word for word. Did Morgan ever hit the Kamala nail on the head. Maria Cutro Tenafly, NJ The Issue: First Lady Jill Biden running a Cabinet meeting while President Biden left for Delaware. Another day, another slap in the face to the American people from the patronizing Democrats (“Who’s the boss?” Sept. 21) President Biden began a Cabinet meeting, then absquatulated back home to Delaware as First Lady Jill Biden took over. This sounds like a skit from an old Marx Brothers movie — but it actually occurred. This abdication from responsibility is jaw-dropping and horrifying. Even as the curtain has been rolled back to reveal their pernicious ways, Democrats continue with their “citizens be damned” arrogance. Sometimes it seems that holding power is their only goal. Come November, the American voter must take it from them. James McCaffrey Yonkers Wake me up from this nightmare. Who put Jill in charge? I don’t remember her being on the ballot in 2020. The sooner the Biden family is sent back to Delaware, where Joe can be on permanent vacation, the better. If this was the Republican Party, we would never hear the end of it. The Dems’ hubris knows no bounds. And who knows how many other meetings Jill was running? Betsy Flor Putnam Valley Want to weigh in on today’s stories?

Email tips@dailymail.com By Amelia Wynne For Mailonline Published:00:54 BST, 27 September 2024 |Updated:00:58 BST, 27 September 2024 e-mail View comments The BBC 'green lighted' Giovanni Pernice to dance on the Italian version of Strictly the show's host has claimed. The professional, 34, is now starring on Ballando con le Stelle after leaving the UK version of the show amid a misconduct probe. It comes after his former partner actress Amanda Abbington made a series of bullying claims about him behind the scenes of the show last year. But now Italian Strictly's host Milly Carlucci has suggested the BBC's approval of Giovanni's inclusion in Ballando con le Stelle 'should tell us something' about the allegations. According to The Telegraph speaking at a press conference ahead of Saturday's launch show, Ms Carlucci said: 'We were in very close contact with the BBC to understand the extent of these accusations. It should tell you something that nine months later they still haven't given an answer. The BBC 'green lighted' Giovanni Pernice to dance on the Italian version of Strictly the show's host has claimed Italian Strictly's host Milly Carlucci (seen) has suggested the BBC's approval of Giovanni's inclusion in Ballando con le Stelle 'should tell us something' about the allegations against him 'If there had been proof, as it were, the perpetrator of the Agatha Christie-style crime would have come out by now. It hasn't come out. 'We have been monitoring the matter with the BBC and they have given us a complete green light in having Giovanni with us and that should also tell us something because the BBC seems to me to be a very serious company.' The publication went on to point out that they understand that all casting decisions for Ballando con le Stelle are a matter for the Italian programme, rather than the BBC. The BBC has been contacted for comment. Giovanni reportedly said he would 'rather not talk about' the ongoing probe when at the same press conference. Giovanni will be on the show from this Saturday onwards with his partner, the actress and TV host Bianca Guaccero. Giovanni shared a career update on Instagram on Monday after Strictly returned to the BBC following Amanda's claims he bullied her last year. The professional dancer shared a video of himself walking the streets of Italy as he discussed his upcoming work. It comes after his former partner actress Amanda Abbington made a series of bullying claims about him behind the scenes of the show last year Giovanni will be on the show from this Saturday onwards with his partner, the actress and TV host Bianca Guaccero Giovanni has been busy rehearsing in Rome for Ballando con le stelle, with his new partner, the stunning Italian singer and actress Bianca. Discussing the show, he said: 'Hello everyone, just a quick update with life from Rome. This week is the first week of the live show which is very exciting and Bianca is doing really really well. 'I did read a lot of your message at the weekend and I am very grateful for all of you.' Giovanni also confirmed he will be returning to the UK very soon and has a busy work schedule touring.

'For now, I am very excited for Ballando con le stelle [Italian version of Strictly Come Dancing], the dance is going very well. Sending lots of love, I love you all'. The outcome of the BBC's inquiry is understood to have been delayed as lawyers for both parties disagree on the findings. There is said to be internal frustration over how long it has taken, given the investigation was launched in April. Some at the BBC are furious that it had to take place at all, taking the view it has been 'a total waste of time and money'. Another senior BBC employee said of the row: 'There are no winners here.' BBC chiefs are also cross that Amanda, 52, hired lawyers to deal with the Corporation over what they saw as 'HR procedure'. The outcome of the BBC's inquiry is understood to have been delayed as lawyers for both parties disagree on the findings (Amanda is seen) After complaining to the BBC when she learned Giovanni was to be signed up for the forthcoming UK series in April, Amanda, brought in legal firm Carter-Ruck. They are representing her on a pro-bono basis. Giovanni, who quit this year's 20th anniversary series over the inquiry being launched, then instructed Schillings. The law firm has previously represented the Duchess of Sussex, J. K. Rowling, Johnny Depp and Lance Armstrong.

And let us be clear, they are not proposals for peace. Instead, they are proposals for surrender,\" she said, referring to the Russian leader.During a separate meeting in the Oval Office with Zelensky, Biden pledged that \"Russia will not prevail\" in the war it launched in February 2022.\"Ukraine will prevail, and we'll continue to stand by you every step of the way,\" Biden said.Dressed in his trademark military-style outfit, Zelensky replied that \"we deeply appreciate that Ukraine and America have stood side by side.\" But Zelensky is navigating the choppy waters of a US presidential election on November 5 that could sink the staunch support that he has received from Washington in the past two-and-a-half years.'Make a deal'Trump, who has long been critical of the billions of dollars in US support for Ukraine, accused Zelensky on the eve of the visit of refusing to strike a deal with Moscow.But after the row had appeared to derail any meeting, Trump announced that he would hold talks with Zelensky at Trump Tower in New York on Friday.\"President Zelensky has asked to meet with me, and I will be meeting with him tomorrow morning at around 9:45,\" the Republican told reporters in New York. Trump also repeated his longstanding claim that he would swiftly cut a peace deal — which Kyiv fears would involve giving up land Moscow has already captured.\"I believe I will be able to make a deal between President Putin and President Zelensky and quite quickly,\" he said.He also suggested he was displeased with Zelensky's recent comments to The New Yorker magazine in which Ukraine's leader said he believed Trump \"doesn't really know how to stop the war.\"Republicans have also been livid after Zelensky visited an arms factory in Biden's hometown in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, accusing the Ukrainian ambassador of organizing a partisan political event and calling for her to be sacked.'They beat Napoleon'Trump has echoed many of Putin's talking points, saying at a rally earlier this week that Ukraine could not win as Russia \"beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon, that's what they do.\"When Trump was president he also asked Zelensky for potentially damaging political material on Biden ahead of the 2020 election — which led to the first of the Republican's two impeachments.Biden seems to be doing whatever he can to Trump-proof support for Ukraine as it faces an increasingly difficult situation on the battlefield against Russia.He pledged nearly $8 billion in military aid on Thursday to \"win this war,\" including $5.5 billion to be authorized before it expires at the end of the US fiscal year on Monday.Biden, whose term ends in January, also called a summit of allies in Germany in October. The White House, however, played down Zelensky's hopes of getting permission to fire long-range Western-made missiles into Russian territory.\"I'm not expecting there to be any new announcements,\" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.Zelensky earlier visited the US Congress and gave a defiant address at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday.Zelensky's visit has prompted fresh nuclear saber-rattling from Moscow.Putin on Wednesday announced plans to broaden Moscow's rules on the use of its atomic weaponry in the event of a \"massive\" air attack. by Danny Kemp, AFP","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2024/09/26/harris-slams-ukraine-surrender-policy-with-trump-confirming-zelensky-meet","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2024-03/c92d3232-5700-4562-bbef-ff91bcbad07d/Rocket_explodes_near_Zelensky__Greek_PM_motorcade.webp?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 23:52:18","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.245},{"id":257567614,"title":"Ukraine war briefing: Trump to meet Zelenskyy, and refuses to say if Ukraine should cede territory to Russia","text":"In an apparent U-turn late on Thursday, Donald Trump told reporters that he would meet Zelenskyy at Trump Tower in New York on Friday morning. The move comes after Kamala Harris described the Trump campaign’s policy on ending Russia’s war as “proposals of surrender”. “These proposals are the same as those of Putin, and let us be clear, they are not proposals for peace,” she said. “Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable.” Trump rejected Harris’ criticisms and insisted that he only wants to stop the “horror show that’s gone on”. When asked if Ukraine should give up territory, Trump was non-committal, saying: “Let’s get some peace … We need peace. We need to stop the death and destruction.” His running mate, JD Vance, had earlier suggested Russia could retain the Ukrainian land it has occupied and establish a demilitarised zone with a heavily fortified frontline to prevent another Russian invasion. Before announcing the meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump posted on social media a purported message from the Ukrainian president asking to see him. The message, which was not confirmed by Ukrainian officials, said “we have to strive to understand each other.” The decision to publicly disclose what appeared to be private communications was a reminder of the tension that has been brewing between Trump and Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy met Joe Biden at the White House for the formal presentation of the Ukraine president’s high-stakes proposal, which he has said can end the war with Russia with additional American aid. The White House issued a short statement after the meeting, saying that the “two leaders discussed the diplomatic, economic, and military aspects of President Zelenskyy’s plan and tasked their teams to engage in intensive consultations regarding next steps”. Zelenskyy has kept the details of the plan secret, but US officials have said it includes additional American aid to prevent a Ukrainian rout on the battlefield and “provide the [Ukrainian] people with the assurance that their future is part of the west”. Biden announced more than $8bn in military assistance to Kyiv, calling it a “surge in security assistance for Ukraine and a series of additional actions to help Ukraine win this war”. The aid includes the provision of a medium-range “glide bomb” munition fired from fighter jets that would allow Ukrainian forces to strike Russian troops and supply lines at safer distances. The package includes additional Patriot air defense battery and missiles, unmanned aerial systems, and measures to strengthen Ukraine’s defense industrial base, Biden said. The US will also expand training for additional F-16 fighter pilots, with an extra 18 pilots to be trained next year. But Biden was not expected to grant a key Ukrainian request that has been supported by the UK – permission to use arms such as long-range Atacms ballistic missiles to strike targets deeper inside Russia – due to fears of escalating the conflict with Russia. Russian forces repeatedly shelled a settlement west of the Ukrainian-held city of Kherson on Thursday, killing one person and wounding another, the region’s governor said. Vyacheslav Prokudin, governor of Kherson region, still partly held by Russian forces, said on Telegram that the woman died when Russian forces hit the village of Tomyna Balka six times. Outside Ukraine’s second largest city of Kharkiv, a strike by Russian multiple rocket launchers triggered a fire engulfing at least six homes in the town of Slatyne, local official Vyacheslav Zadorenko said. Zadorenko said emergency services were tackling the blaze and trying to establish whether any residents were trapped under rubble. Kharkiv, located 30 km (18 miles) from the border, has been a frequent target of Russian attacks. Reuters could not verify the reports independently.","summary":"Former president to meet Ukrainian president at Trump Tower on Friday amid fierce criticism of his campaign’s plans to end Russia’s invasion.

The injection has previously been used to treat diabetes, but has faced criticism in recent months after a string of celebs revealed they'd used it for weight loss. There is no suggestion that any star lined up for the new series is taking Ozempic. But, it's now been claimed that in the future, any stars with a prescription for the jab could be allowed to continue their injections while living in the camp, casting doubt on whether they'll endure the show's famous eating trials. It's also been reported that the injection, which typically suppresses the appetite, could bring an end to stars' hunger causing tensions in the camp. According to The Sun, ITV medics are willing to administer the drug off-camera, and outside camp, to any celeb with a doctors' note or prescription. I'm A Celebrity's stars are reportedly set to be allowed the controversial Ozempic weight loss jabs, casting doubt on the show's eating trials (winner Sam Thompson is pictured) The injection has previously been used to treat diabetes, but has faced criticism in recent months after a string of celebs revealed they'd used it for weight loss This will not be a new rule for Ozempic, but is in keeping with ITV's rules on medicines, as it's stated that any celebrities taking part in the show must fully disclose their medical history. A source said: 'The drug is already controversial after being exploited by stars for weight loss rather than diabetes, but it's not for ITV to pass judgment. 'It will be no different with Ozempic. So long as celebs have a proper doctors' note, and the drug has been prescribed, they will be able to get their regular injection as normal. 'It won't just be lying around the camp. Ozempic pens have to be stored in the fridge so they will have to be safely stored under lock and key off-site. It's also reported that any stars taking Ozempic may need to taper their dosage to lower amounts over a period, as stopping the drug overnight can cause blood-sugar fluctuations or severe gastrointestinal symptoms. An ITV source told The Sun: 'As part of the well-established and robust casting process each celebrity has a full medical assessment to make sure they are fit to take part.' MailOnline has contacted a representative for ITV for comment. So far, names rumoured to be taking part in this year's I'm A Celeb include singer Tulisa, Olympian Max Whitlock, Coronation Street's Alan Halsall, boxer Tommy Fury and former Strictly star Oti Mabuse. Now, it's been claimed that any stars with a prescription for the jab could be allowed to continue their injections while living in the camp (hosts Ant and Dec are pictured) This has cast doubt on whether stars will endure the show's famous eating trials if they are using Ozempic jabs Celebrities have been turning to Ozempic in recent years to help shed the pounds. In March, reality star Scott Disick showed off his drastic weight loss after using Mounjaro, another weight loss drug, to get rid of his 'dad bod,' while Kelly Clarkson recently admitted to using a drug to slim down. Rebel Wilson lost 80lb in four years to reach her goal weight of 165lb (11st 8lb). She shed most of the excess in 2020, calling it her 'year of health,' and putting it down to healthy eating and exercise. However, while promoting her memoir, Rebel Rising, she admitted to using Ozempic briefly after she had lost weight, to help maintain her new shape. Sharon Osbourne has been open about using the weight loss drug Ozempic. However, the music manager said she has since struggled to put weight on after shedding the pounds using the drug. Speaking on Loose Women earlier this year, she said: 'I don't regret it. Everything with weight with me was, 'I want it now.' The injections that I was on worked, but it just seems that now I can't put anything on really.' Sharon added: 'I lost over 40lbs, If I could I would put back another 10. 'I'm just an ordinary person who got lucky and I didn't take advantage of that. I never want to forget I am blessed and been really lucky in my life.' However, other stars have shared the dangers of the drug, including model Lottie Moss who revealed she was hospitalised after overdosing on Ozempic. The model was violently ill, suffering a seizure and severe dehydration after taking the drug when she weighed around 60kg - just 9stone. Australian actress Rebel Wilson - pictured in 2018, left, and 2022 - shed 80lb in four years to reach her goal weight of 165lb (11st 8lb) and later admitted to using Ozempic However, other stars have shared the dangers of the drug, including model Lottie Moss who revealed she was hospitalised after overdosing on Ozempic She said she would rather 'die' than use Ozempic again, which is meant to treat the obese or diabetics and has suffered global shortages. Lottie recalled having the seizure, which was caused by severe dehydration, and said her face and hands clenching up was one of the 'scariest' experiences she has ever endured. She said there were, 'small things I wish I'd known before taking it' and revealed her weight plummeted to around 53kg in a few weeks. After being seen by medical professionals, Lottie learned the dosage of Ozempic she was injecting into her leg should be prescribed to someone weighing at least 100 kilos - nearly double her size. Lottie explained: 'A few months ago, I was not feeling happy about my weight, I had a friend, and she could get it for me. 'It was below board, from a doctor, but it wasn't like you go into a doctor's office and he prescribes it for you, takes your blood pressure, and takes tests, which is what you need when you go on something like Ozempic. 'At the end of the day it is a medication, it is dangerous and really meant for weight loss of people of a very large size. 'When I was taking it, the amount that I was taking was meant for people who are 100 kilos and over and I'm in the 50s range.' Lottie said she weighed approximately 60 kilos before she dropped to 57 following her first dose and was 53 kilos at her lowest, which is just over eight stone. The truth behind new diet drug craze - Hollywood is hooked on it, and social media is fanning demand for the latest weight-loss 'miracle' Over the summer I was lucky enough to be invited to a 60th birthday at which the after-dinner entertainment was a private performance by one of the UK's leading male pop stars. More eye-popping than the actual show, though, was how incredible said star looked. He was a mere shadow of his former self, prancing around the stage in a silver catsuit. His secret? Semaglutide, or Ozempic as it is branded, a new diet drug that everybody – but everybody, darling, including one of the world's most famous supermodels – is apparently taking. Originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, it is used off-label (for a purpose other than that for which it was licensed) in both the US and the UK to treat obesity. In research conducted by its billionaire manufacturer, the Danish-based pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, patients lost an average of 17 per cent of their overall body weight over 68 weeks. This compares with five to nine per cent for 'oldschool' anti-obesity drugs such as Metformin. Only available in the UK on the NHS if you have type 2 diabetes, Ozempic can be obtained through a private doctor, and if you are willing to take it without medical supervision – not recommended by doctors (see panel) – you can get it online through various weight-loss programmes. It is sometimes taken in tablet form but more commonly as an injection. Originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, Semaglutide is used off-label. It has been branded as a new diet drug that everybody is apparently taking Predictably, Hollywood has been aware of Ozempic for a lot longer than us – Variety magazine recently quipped that the drug deserved its own thank-you speech at the Emmys, as so many stars on the podium had obviously been taking it. Elon Musk raved about its more powerful sister drug, Wegovy, on Twitter; Kim Kardashian, it is hotly rumoured, used semaglutide to lose 16lb in order to fit into Marilyn Monroe's dress for the Met Ball. On TikTok the hashtag #ozempic has had more than 285 million views. Thanks to the hype, there has been a surge in demand, causing shortages on both sides of the Atlantic, with a backlash against influencers and celebrities hogging supplies ahead of desperate diabetes sufferers. Predictably, Big Pharma has come up with an alternative – tirzepatide (brand name Mounjaro), manufactured by Eli Lilly – but it has yet to be approved by the US Food & Drug Administration for weight loss. Novo Nordisk has issued a statement to say its supplies will be replenished by the end of the year, but it hasn't quelled anxiety. At least two middle-aged male friends of mine who started using it in September are getting themselves in a twist about being caught short before the holidays. As one private London GP remarked to me: 'It's like the H RT panic last spring.' So what exactly is this drug? Semaglutide belongs to a class called GLP-1 agonists, which not only regulate blood sugar but, as was discovered about a decade ago, also mimic the gut hormones that regulate our appetites – the ones that tell the brain when we are hungry or full. There are, of course, side effects: acid reflux, nausea, exacerbation of IBS symptoms and fatigue (but much less so than in earlier GLP-1 agonists such as Saxenda), as well as pancreatitis, gallstones and, in very high doses, it has caused thyroid tumours in rats. Meanwhile, when you stop using it the effect wears off immediately and in some cases it won't work at all. 'I would describe semaglutide as an example of very smart science,' says leading consultant endocrinologist Dr Efthimia Karra from her private practice off London's Harley Street. 'But it is not a panacea for everyone. Around a fifth of users do not respond to it. This is because the human body favours weight gain, thus when you lose weight the body will do anything to revert to its highest BMI. The heavier you are the harder it is to lose weight. If a patient has made no progress in three months, I will take them off it.' Banker's wife Laura, a native New Yorker in her mid-50s who had hovered between decades, started using it in January. 'The Paleo diet, 5:2, CBT, NLP, bootcamp, diet delivery services – I've tried them all,' she says from the family home in Hampshire, 'and I've always yo-yoed right back. After my last annual checkup I seriously contemplated giving up. Then my doctor suggested semaglutide.' After only a month she noticed her clothes had become looser. From then on, the weight started dropping off. 'The strange thing was, I wasn't eating anything different. I just couldn't physically have seconds any more, and the idea of pudding after a full meal had lost its allure.' Three months on, she is two stone lighter ‒ though occasionally she suffers heartburn if she eats too late at night or drinks alcohol ‒ and when we spoke in autumn, she was looking forward to losing another stone by Christmas. 'There is a niggling voice that tells me it is both risky and lazy to take a drug to lose weight, and I worry that it will all pile on again if I stop taking it. But if it does, I will seriously consider taking it indefinitely.' Private London GP Dr Martin Galy has been prescribing semaglutide for about a year to clients who cannot lose the weight they gained in menopause. He has seen it have a transformational effect, too, on much younger women who suffer polycystic ovary syndrome. 'PCOS sufferers are difficult to treat, and you can imagine how body image plays a very important part when it comes to self-esteem.' But according to Tom Sanders, professor of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London, it is not a magic bullet. Commenting on a study on semaglutide published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2021, he says, 'The challenge post-weight loss is to prevent a regain in weight,' he wrote. It may prove to be useful in the short term, but 'public health measures that encourage behavioural changes such as regular physical activity and moderating dietary energy intake are still needed'. That said, given our rising national obesity statistics and the escalation in accompanying health issues such as heart failure, cancer and obstructive sleep apnoea clogging up hospital beds, we're going to need something. Semaglutide may be the rich person's drug today, but might it be approved for more widespread use? Only time will tell.

Aides to the presidents of the United States and Ukraine, Joe Biden and Vladimir Zelensky, are currently discussing details of the Kiev government’s proposed plan to settle the Ukrainian conflict, White House National Security Council Strategic Communications Coordinator John Kirby has told reporters. \"Here [at the White House] he [Zelensky] had a chance to present the broad contours of his victory plan to President Biden and to our national security team, and the president directed our team to work with his team over the next couple of weeks to dig into it a little bit more. Both presidents are planning to meet in Germany, when we head over there on the 12th of October,\" he said. \"They'll meet to further flesh it out and see what we together can do to help President Zelensky really achieve this just and lasting peace that that he's trying to achieve.\" Earlier, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said he had prepared a conflict resolution plan that he intends to discuss with US President Joe Biden as some provisions depended on Washington’s decisions. He also plans to present it to the US presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Later, Sergey Leshchenko, an adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, said the plan is based on the assumption that the Western countries will approve strikes deep into Russian territory. As Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out, Ukraine is unable to strike deep into Russian territory without Western assistance, as it needs intelligence from satellites and flight tasks to do so. At the same time, the Ukrainian leader also named the ‘victory plan,’ based on his ‘peace formula’ as a possible way of resolving the crisis. Moscow has repeatedly criticized it for being unrealistic, saying that the situation on the ground must be taken into account. Besides, Moscow voiced its support for the peace plan, proposed by China and Brazil, which Ukraine rejected as ‘unrealistic.’ Russian President Vladimir Putin set forth the conditions for resolving the situation in Ukraine at a meeting with senior Foreign Ministry officials on June 14. His terms included Ukraine withdrawing troops from Donbass and Novorossia and abandoning plans to join NATO. In addition, Moscow believes that all Western sanctions must be lifted and Ukraine’s non-bloc and non-nuclear status must be guaranteed. Putin noted that if Ukraine and the West turned down the initiative, the conditions might change in the future. Kiev rejected Russia’s peace plan.","summary":"\"Both presidents are planning to meet in Germany, when we head over there on the 12th of October,\" John Kirby said","url":"https://tass.com/world/1848469","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 23:42:29","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.048},{"id":257565450,"title":"Trump mocks Kamala Harris’ planned border visit in NYC presser: ‘Why didn’t she fix it almost four years ago?’","text":"Former President Donald Trump mocked Kamala Harris’ planned visit to the border — just her second as vice president — arguing she’s had three years to solve the illegal migrant crisis. Harris is expected to travel to Douglas, Ariz., on Friday and is planning to make a stop at the border to talk about increasing security. “Why didn’t she fix it almost four years ago? She’s got no plans, got no talent, got no ability to do it,” the former president said Thursday during a press conference at Trump Tower. The Arizona stop will be the first time Harris has seen the border as the Democratic presidential nominee. She went to the border as vice president in 2021 amid pressure for her to see firsthand the processing centers. “She’s going there tomorrow, after almost four years, she’s going there tomorrow to try and show you what a great job she did,” Trump argued in his remarks. Harris has campaigned on supporting the killed bipartisan border bill that would have shut down the border if illegal border crossings topped 2,500 per week — but still would have allowed in about 1.8 million migrants per year. “Donald Trump got word of the bill, realized it was going to fix a problem he wanted to run on and told them to kill the bill, don’t put it up for a vote,” Harris said in an interview with MSNBC on Wednesday. “He killed a bill that would have actually been a solution, because he wants to run on a problem, instead of fixing a problem.” The Harris-Biden administration revoked several of Trump’s policies like Remain in Mexico and halted the further building of the border wall when they took office in 2021. “You can’t justify she should save her airfare. She should go back to the White House and tell the president to close the border,” Trump said. “He can do it with the signing of just a signature and a piece of paper to the border patrol. Instead, she’s going there to try and convince people that she wasn’t as bad as everybody knows she was.” Trump vowed to “terminate all sanctuary cities,” stop Catch and Release, “shut down all entries through the migrant phone app” and reinstate Remain in Mexico. He also said he would send federal law enforcement to “liberate” Aurora, Colo., which has experienced an uptick in migrants, crime and the gang Tren de Aragua.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump mocked Kamala Harris’ planned visit to the border — just her second as vice president — arguing she’s had three years to solve the illegal migrant crisis.

Tens of thousands of people were without power and roads were already flooded ahead of what is expected to be one of the largest Gulf of Mexico storms in decades. Fast-moving Helene strengthened to an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 4 hurricane Thursday evening, ahead of landfall expected around 11pm (0300 GMT), the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. It was packing winds of 130 miles (215 kilometers) per hour as it churned over the Gulf's warm waters towards the Big Bend area south of Florida's capital city Tallahassee. \"EVERYONE along the Florida Big Bend coast is at risk of potentially catastrophic storm surge,\" the NHC said on social media. Tampa and Tallahassee airports have closed, with parts of St. Petersburg, downtown Tampa, Sarasota, Treasure Island and other cities on Florida's west coast already flooded. About 125,000 homes and businesses were without power. \"We're expecting to see a storm surge inundation of 15 to 20 feet above ground level,\" NHC director Mike Brennan said. \"That's up to the top of a second story building. Again, a really unsurvivable scenario is going to play out here in this portion of the Florida coastline.\" The accompanying waves \"can destroy houses, move cars, and that water level is going to rise very quickly,\" Brennan added. - Evacuate or hunker down? - In Alligator Point, a coastal town on a picturesque peninsula in the storm's path, David Wesolowski was taking no chances. \"I just came to button up a few things before it gets too windy,\" the 37-year-old real estate agent told AFP as he boarded up his house on stilts. \"If it stays on course, this is going to look different afterwards, that's for sure,\" he said, before taking his family to higher ground in Tallahassee. Meanwhile, Patrick Riickert refused to budge from his small wooden house in Crawfordville, a town of 5,000 people a few miles inland. As in Alligator Point, most residents have bolted and it looked like a ghost town, but Riickert, his wife and five grandchildren were \"not going anywhere,\" the 58-year-old insisted. \"I am going to hunker down\" and ride out the hurricane, as he did in 2018 when deadly Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 megastorm, blew through the Florida panhandle. The NHC warned of up to 20 inches (51 cm) of rain in some spots, and potentially life-threatening flooding as well as numerous landslides across the southern Appalachians. The National Weather Service said the region could be hit extremely hard, with floods not seen in more than a century. \"This will be one of the most significant weather events to happen in the western portions of the area in the modern era,\" it warned. Tornado warnings went out across northern Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. Georgia's sprawling capital Atlanta was forecast to experience tropical storm-force winds and flash flooding from up to 12 inches of rain. And Tennessee -- more than 300 miles from the Gulf Coast -- braced for tropical storm conditions statewide. More than 55 million Americans were under some form of weather alert or warning from Hurricane Helene. - 'Life-threatening impacts' - \"This is going to be a multi-state event with the potential for significant impacts from Florida all the way to Tennessee,\" Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Deanne Criswell told reporters. Vice President Kamala Harris said the White House was watching. \"The President and I, of course, are monitoring the case and the situation closely, and we urge everyone who is watching at this very moment to take this storm very seriously,\" she told reporters. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis mobilized the National Guard and ordered thousands of personnel to ready for search-and-rescue operations. He warned that the powerful storm would be dangerous, and urged everyone to take precautions. \"We can't control how strong this hurricane is going to get. We can't control the track of the hurricane, but what you can control is what you can do to put yourself in the best chance to be able to ride this out in a way that's going to be safe.\" Helene could become the most powerful hurricane to hit the United States in over a year -- and almost certainly the biggest. Hurricane specialist Michael Lowry called Helene \"extreme,\" noting its tropical storm winds of 39 mph or higher stretched nearly 500 miles across. Researchers say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes, because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on.

Since the day after Hamas’ Oct. 7 terror attack, Hezbollah has launched nearly 9,000 rockets, missiles and drones into Israel, forcing the evacuation of 60,000-plus people from the north. A week ago, commanders of Hez’s elite Radwan Force met to advance an Oct. 7-style invasion of Israel that would have made Hamas’ attack look like an interfaith picnic. Israel is finally fighting back: It wiped out the Radwan commanders in an airstrike and is moving to destroy Hezbollah’s rocket launchers and missile stocks. So, of course, now the White House demands a cease-fire. Has it no decency? What choice does Israel have? And President Biden’s statement with French President Emmanuel Macron didn’t even cite Hezbollah by name as a party to the fighting. “It is time for a settlement on the Israel-Lebanon border that ensures safety and security to enable civilians to return to their homes,” the message reads. “We call for . . . the immediate support of the Governments of Israel and Lebanon.” Sorry: The Lebanese government has nothing to do with it: It’s Hezbollah that’s the problem — and it’s not going anywhere voluntarily. Indeed, Israel has warned Hez repeatedly that if it doesn’t quit the rocket fire and retreat north of the Litani River (about 18 miles from the Israeli border), the IDF will act. The terrorists have ignored those warnings for a year, and now Israel is making good on its threat (a foreign concept for Harris-Biden) so its people can return home. How clueless — and callous — for Biden and Kamala Harris to expect Israel to suddenly stand down now. Heck, the idea itself was such a nonstarter for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he didn’t even bother to respond, his office tweeted. Instead, Bibi vowed to “continue to hit Hezbollah with all our might.” If Biden-Harris had any true compassion, any desire for real peace and not just a three-week joke of a cease-fire for the benefit of anti-Israel voters, they’d encourage Israel to finish off the terrorists — and maybe even help. Instead, the Pentagon says the US military won’t provide intelligence or other support for Israeli operations in Lebanon. It’s beyond pitiful. But it goes a long way toward explaining why the entire world is aflame.","summary":"Team Harris-Biden’s approach to the Middle East isn’t just naïve — it’s devoid of any sense of right and wrong.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/26/opinion/hezbollah-cease-fire-plan-proves-joe-biden-kamala-harris-are-both-naive-and-heartless/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/2024-lebanon-said-23-people-90382522.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 23:30:06","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.249},{"id":257564932,"title":"Sir Keir Starmer to meet with Donald Trump to ‘establish a relationship’","text":"Sir Keir Starmer is to meet with Donald Trump later tonight. It is believed to be the first meeting between the current UK prime minister and former – and potentially future – US president. The pair are set to meet overnight UK time, which is the evening in New York, where Sir Keir is currently located while on a visit to the UN. David Lammy, the Labour foreign secretary, has met Mr Trump‘s vice presidential candidate, JD Vance. Speaking to journalists, Sir Keir reiterated he wanted to meet both Mr Trump and Kamala Harris ahead of the November vote. However, meeting the Democrat is hard due to the “usual diary challenges”. Sir Keir said: “It’ll be really to establish a relationship between the two of us. “I’m a great believer in personal relations on the international stage. “I think it really matters that you know who your counterpart is in any given country, and know them personally, get to know them face to face. “So it’s really along those lines. I won’t go into what we’ll actually discuss, obviously, but that’s the purpose of it, as you’d expect, ahead of the election.” Asked if a Trump presidency would leave Ukraine exposed, Sir Keir said the nature of the “special relationship” between the UK and US “always sits above whoever holds the particular office”. “The US people will decide who they want as their president, and we will work with whoever is president,” he added. “I’m not going to speculate on what any particular issues may be on the other side of the election.” Speaking ahead of the meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Sir Keir was “very nice”. He said: “I actually think he’s very nice. He ran a great race, he did very well, it’s very early, he’s very popular.” Mr Trump went on to praise Reform UK leader Nigel Farage as well, saying: “I think Nigel is great, I’ve known him for a long time.” “He had a great election too, picked up a lot of seats, more seats than he was allowed to have actually. “They acknowledged that he won but for some reason you have a strange system over there, you might win them but you don’t get them.” This appears to be a misunderstanding of how the UK’s first past the post system for elections chooses MPs – Reform won fewer seats compared to its vote share because it came second in many seats.","summary":"Sir Keir Starmer is to meet with Donald Trump later tonight.

Instead, she’s going there to try and convince people that she wasn’t as bad as everybody knows she was.” Trump vowed to “terminate all sanctuary cities,” stop Catch and Release, “shut down all entries through the migrant phone app” and reinstate Remain in Mexico. He also said he would send federal law enforcement to “liberate” Aurora, Colo., which has experienced an uptick in migrants, crime and the gang Tren de Aragua.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump mocked Kamala Harris&#8217; planned visit to the border &#8212; just her second as vice president &#8212; arguing she&#8217;s had three years to solve the illegal migrant crisis.

The vice president said she would work to ensure Ukraine prevails in the war, now in its third year, and achieves a just peace. She then criticized former President Trump, her Republican rival in the Nov. 5 election, without naming him. Trump later said he would meet Zelenskiy on Friday morning at Trump Tower in New York. While Trump and Zelenskiy spoke by phone in July, they have not met in person since Trump’s presidential term ended in 2021. She said “there are some” in the United States who would force Ukraine to give up large parts of its territory and abandon its security relationships with other nations. “These proposals are the same as those of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, and let us be clear, they are not proposals for peace. Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable,” she said. Trump has said U.S. aid to Ukraine is a waste of money and has declined to say whether he wants Ukraine to win.

The Prime Minister is visiting the Republican presidential candidate’s Trump Tower for talks ahead of November’s US election. Sir Keir said he wanted to meet Mr Trump face to face because “I’m a great believer in personal relationships on the world stage”. The meeting has the potential to be diplomatically awkward, not just because of Mr Trump’s bombastic style but also because Sir Keir has not been able to schedule a similar appointment with Democratic candidate and vice president Kamala Harris. Ahead of the meeting, Sir Keir told reporters: “I’ve said a number of times, I want to meet both candidates. “We’ve now got the opportunity to meet Trump, which is good. “Obviously, I still want to speak to Harris as well. “But you know, the usual diary challenges, but it’s good that this one now has been fixed. “It’ll be really to establish a relationship between the two of us. “I’m a great believer in personal relations on the international stage. “I think it really matters that you know who your counterpart is in any given country, and know them personally, get to know them face to face.” Foreign Secretary David Lammy – who called Mr Trump a “racist KKK and Nazi sympathiser” in 2017 and promised to protest on the streets if he visited the UK – was also attending the Trump Tower meeting. Speaking at a press conference before they met, Mr Trump said he thought Sir Keir was “very nice”. He said: “I actually think he’s very nice. He ran a great race, he did very well, it’s very early, he’s very popular.” The presidential candidate added praise for Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. He said: “I think Nigel is great, I’ve known him for a long time. He had a great election too, picked up a lot of seats, more seats than he was allowed to have actually. They acknowledged that he won but for some reason you have a strange system over there, you might win them but you don’t get them.” Sir Keir said the UK embassy team, led by ambassador Dame Karen Pierce, “has got good relations with both camps and has had for a long time”. “So it’s not the sort of start of something, it’s the continuation of those good relations that have been there with both camps, and that’s a really good thing that the embassy has been doing.” Asked whether he would be prepared to stand up to Mr Trump on issues such as support for Ukraine, Sir Keir said: “The first thing I think is important to say in relation to this is we’ve obviously had a special relationship with the US for a long time, forged in really difficult circumstances. “That always sits above whoever holds the particular office, either in the US or the UK. “And it is really important. “I think it’s probably as strong now as it’s ever been, in relation to the Middle East and Ukraine. “And you’ve seen how closely I’ve been working with the US in relation to both of those issues. “The US people will decide who they want as their president, and we will work with whoever is president, as you would expect. “I’m not going to speculate on what any particular issues may be the other side of the election.”","summary":"The Prime Minister is yet to schedule a meeting with Mr Trump’s election opponent Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/donald-trump-keir-starmer-kamala-harris-prime-minister-new-york-b1184468.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/09/26/22/4b283c370343972a91e07ca7655a22daY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzI3NDYxODA0-2.30593317.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 23:18:30","author":"David Hughes","authors":["David Hughes"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.089},{"id":257564700,"title":"Hurricane Helene Strengthens To Category 4 As It Nears Florida's Gulf Coast","text":"A powerful hurricane was barreling towards Florida on Thursday, with officials warning of \"unsurvivable\" conditions and a potentially catastrophic storm surge high enough to swamp a two-story house.Tens of thousands of people were without power and roads were already flooded ahead of what is expected to be one of the largest Gulf of Mexico storms in decades.Fast-moving Helene strengthened to an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 4 hurricane Thursday evening, ahead of landfall expected around 11pm (0300 GMT), the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.It was packing winds of 130 miles (215 kilometers) per hour as it churned over the Gulf's warm waters towards the Big Bend area south of Florida's capital city Tallahassee.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"EVERYONE along the Florida Big Bend coast is at risk of potentially catastrophic storm surge,\" the NHC said on social media.Tampa and Tallahassee airports have closed, with parts of St. Petersburg, downtown Tampa, Sarasota, Treasure Island and other cities on Florida's west coast already flooded.About 125,000 homes and businesses were without power.\"We're expecting to see a storm surge inundation of 15 to 20 feet above ground level,\" NHC director Mike Brennan said. \"That's up to the top of a second story building.

His MSNBC colleagues didn’t quite agree. After a quick break down of key battleground states like Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, all showing Kamala Harris and Trump polling within a percentage point of each other, the “Morning Joe” team laid out how the race is as close to a tied as possible. That’s when Scarborough shared his belief. “I’m almost getting the feeling – I don’t want anybody to throw tomatoes at me – I’m almost get the feeling that if Joe Biden had somehow manage to stay in the race, it would still be tied,” he said. “Donald Trump’s numbers aren’t moving. It’s just how many people eventually find their way back to the Democratic party.” Watch the full segment below: “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski could be heard “mm-mm”-ing in disagreement as Scarborough shared his thoughts.

After hearing this and showing a clip of Trump rambling about buying furniture at one of his North Carolina rallies, Scarborough seemed flabbergasted that the race against “Mr. Shark, Mr. Hannibal Lecter” was still tied. He did, however, walk back his comments from only minutes earlier. “I move to amend my previous remarks, you bring up some great points,” he told Geist. “Joe Biden was seeing numbers in Minnesota, in Virginia, in New Hampshire get too close for comfort there, so you may be right.

The poll, conducted by the New York-based Marist College, found that Harris and Trump both have the support of 49% among likely voters in North Carolina. In Arizona and Georgia, Trump leads by just one percentage point, with 50% of potential voters in both states indicating they would support him, while 49% lean towards Harris. The survey was conducted between September 19 and September 24 and included 4,643 registered voters across all three states. All respondents indicated they planned to vote in November, and 91% expressed certainty about their choice. These three states offer a total of 43 electoral votes combined. Trump won North Carolina in both 2016 and 2020. He also defeated then-Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in Arizona and Georgia in 2016 but lost both states to President Joe Biden in 2020, marking the first time a Democratic nominee won Georgia since 1992. Trump actively disputed the Georgia election results, alleging that the election was rigged. These claims were refuted by various state officials, including Republican Governor Brian Kemp. Another poll conducted in August by the Siena College Research Institute showed that Harris had a significant lead over Trump in three other swing states: Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. The vice president was expected to outpace her rival by 50% to 46% across all three states, according to the poll’s data. However, in 2020, the final gap between Biden and Trump turned out to be much smaller than earlier survey predictions. Nationwide polling results published by the New York Times on Thursday also suggested that Harris is beating Trump by three points. The paper noted, however, that the former president could “easily prevail” if he gains ground in several key states, including Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Nevada, where Harris’ lead is within two percentage points.","summary":"Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are separated by one percent in Georgia and Arizona and are tied in North Carolina, according to a poll \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/604749-trump-harris-tied-swing-states/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.09/article/66f5d1dc2030272aae3471cd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 23:11:03","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.569},{"id":257564696,"title":"Biden allocates more military funding for Ukraine","text":"Biden allocates more military funding for Ukraine Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the White House on Thursday for meetings with President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.

The charges released on Thursday said that after he purchased economy class tickets for himself and his domestic partner to India in 2016 on Turkish Airlines he accepted upgrades to business class, which prosecutors assert was valued at nearly $13,000 that he did not disclose receiving it in his official filings. The prosecutors put the amounts he illegally benefitted from at $100,000. No one connected to India is mentioned in the indictment which centres on his alleged ties to Turkey. Most of the allegations, including that about the trip to India, relate to the period he was the President of the city’s Brooklyn borough before he became Mayor in 2022. Adams, who is African-American — only the second from the community of the city’s 110 Mayors — and is a Democrat. However, he has been at odds with the administration of President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, criticising their border policies that let in more than 12 million illegal immigrants overwhelming New York and other cities. In a statement professing his innocence, he cited his criticism of the Federal government’s inaction on “its broken immigration policies”. On a day he was on his way to Washington to lead a group of Mayors in a protest over the fallout of illegal immigration, Federal agents launched a search of the house of his campaign finance official causing him to abandon the protest and turn back to New York. A former police captain, he has also been tough on crime, drawing criticism from the party’s Left and at variance to some of the lenient policies that Harris had once advocated. The Turkish government, businesses, educational institutions, and local administrations allegedly gave him free hospitality and funneled campaign contributions illegally to him through third parties. Besides his trip to India, he is alleged to have received free tickets, upgrades, or hospitality for visits to Turkey, China, Hungary, and Sri Lanka In return, among other things, he helped the 36-storey Turkish Consulate tower get a fire department clearance, according to the indictment. The charges against him were unveiled two days after Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan severely criticised the West in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly. The city of 8.25 million people has been in turmoil for several weeks with several top officials, including the Police Commissioner and the schools Chancellor resigning after they came under investigations. The Federal prosecutors have been going after foreign interference in US politics occurring in the New York area. Earlier this month, Linda Sun, a former senior aide to Governor Kathy Hochul was arrested and charged with secretly wporking for China. In May, Bob Menendez, a powerful Senator who headed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was convicted on bribery charges relating to his illegal collaborations with Egypt and Qatar. At a flag-hoisting ceremony honouring India’s Independence last month, he recalled his visit to the country. He said, “I recall in my trip to India, and the most significant part of that trip that I remember, I remember watching the last footsteps of our leader, Gandhi, and where the assassin took his life, and how we have a responsibility and obligation to continue those footsteps.” –IANS al/khz","summary":"New York, Sep 27 (IANS) Eric Adams, the outspoken Mayor of the largest US city, has been charged with bribery and campaign financing irregularities by Federal prosecutors, and one of the allegations relates to a trip he took to India.

Yet, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have kept very quiet on who they're rooting for, despite encouraging Americans to vote in a recent Archewell Foundation statement. Now, a leading royal expert has expressed their puzzlement over this silence, reports OK! Former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond admitted: \"I don't know why they won't publicly back Kamala Harris. I only wish they would. They are trying to use their platform for good causes and in the view of any sane person it would surely be an excellent cause to try and persuade people that Trump is a danger to the civilised world.\" But Jennie went on to suggest their royal ties might be holding them back, saying: \"I suppose it is still controversial for a member of the Royal Family, even a non-working and estranged one, to meddle in politics. Also American people might consider it extremely presumptuous of a British Prince to try to influence a US election.\" READ MORE: Prince Harry 'ruined bond with Kate Middleton after snide remarks broke huge rule' READ MORE: Meghan Markle's email rule speaks volumes on how she really treats staff The Duke and Duchess of Sussex released a statement last week, urging people to vote in the election, without backing either candidate. The statement said: \"Voting is not just a right; it's a fundamental way to influence the fate of our communities. At The Archewell Foundation, we recognise that civic engagement, no matter one's political party, is at the heart of a more just and equitable world. By participating in initiatives like this, we aim to amplify the message that every voice matters. Together, let's make sure every eligible voter is informed and empowered to participate in shaping America's future.\" Their move has been criticised by some, with PR expert Renae Smith of publicity firm The Atticism, telling the Express that she believes the couple have \"worked hard to drive home their position as independent global figures, so this statement falls in line with the brand they've been working to build - eg that they do what they want, without any thought towards royal guidelines or customs\". Jennie voiced her opinion that the Sussexes should take a stand and endorse a political candidate, despite potential backlash and Donald Trump's previous harsh words for Prince Harry. She pointed out: \"There is the small matter of Trump wreaking vengeance on Harry given that he has been highly critical of the Prince,\" and recalled his biting remark: \"'I wouldn't protect Harry. He betrayed the Queen. He would be on his own if it was down to me.'\" She went on to say that she also thought Meghan should still speak up, saying: \"But I can't see any good reason for Meghan to stay silent about her allegiance. She has made her views about Trump extremely clear in the past. Perhaps they just don't want all the grief that would inevitably come from them endorsing a candidate.\" Jennie also suggested that their PR statement was perhaps a \"compromise\", as she explained: \"I don't think anyone is in any doubt about their views on American politics... so I suppose their guarded statement about the election could be seen as a mature and responsible compromise, simply encouraging people to use their vote. Personally, though, I think that if Taylor Swift can do it, then Meghan, at least, should follow suit.\" Sign up to the Irish Mirror's daily newsletter here and get breaking news and top stories direct to your inbox","summary":"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have been urged to publicly back their preferred US Presidential candidate by a royal expert – but she's also shared why it's unlikely to happen","url":"https://www.irishmirror.ie/showbiz/us-gossip/meghan-markle-us-election-harry-33759309","image":"https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article33759291.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/5_prince-harry-and-meghan-markle.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 23:05:00","author":"Joanna Berry,Peter Hart,Rebecca Russell","authors":["Joanna Berry","Peter Hart","Rebecca Russell"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.071},{"id":257568472,"title":"Biden order tackles trauma of school shooting drills","text":"The White House announced an executive order on Thursday that aims to improve school shooter drills and combat emerging gun threats stemming from new technology. This order comes one year after President Joe Biden created the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which was launched as a way for him to address gun violence while bypassing the gridlock of Congress. The executive order establishes a new Emerging Firearms Threats Task Force and directs the body to issue a report within 90 days that includes an assessment of the threat posed by machine-gun conversion devices and unserialized 3D-printed firearms. Machine-gun conversion devices “enable semi-automatic firearms, including easily concealable handguns, to match or exceed the rate of fire of many military machineguns with a single engagement of the trigger—up to 20 bullets in one second,” according to a White House fact sheet. They are illegal to possess under federal law, but these devices continue to be found at crime scenes because they are small, cheap, and easy to install. Unserialized 3D-printed firearms, which the White House said are often employed to make machine-gun conversion devices, are often trafficked and unlawfully possessed by criminals and people convicted of domestic violence. “The 3D-printing of a machine-gun conversion device costs as little as 40 cents and takes fewer than 30 minutes,” according to the White House. “As 3D-printing technology continues to develop rapidly, the safety threat posed by 3D-printed firearms may suddenly increase.” The executive order also calls for a plan to lessen the trauma inflicted on children by active shooter drills. The guide will be based on the latest research on how to safely and effectively conduct the drills on K-12 campuses, with adjustments based on age-appropriate guidance. “Many parents, students, and educators have expressed concerns about the trauma caused by some approaches to these drills,” a White House statement said. “Federal agencies need to help schools improve drills so they can more effectively prepare for an active shooter situation while also preventing or minimizing any trauma.” The executive order also keeps Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for president, in the spotlight as she campaigns for the White House. Harris shared her views and policy stances on gun reform at Oprah Winfrey’s “Unite for America” town hall on Sept. 19. “Some people have been pushing a really false choice,” she said during the event. “To suggest you’re either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone’s guns away.” As the Associated Press reported earlier this month, mass shootings can alter a person’s sense of safety and inflict post-traumatic stress disorder on children and their families. Psychologist Emilie Ney reminded parents that after a shooting, students as young as age 5 can be navigating stages of grief. Active shooter drills, which have become ingrained as a part of life for school-aged children in America, have lasting negative effects on their mental health. According to research by the Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, a study found “insufficient conclusive research affirming the value of active shooter drills.” In fact, the opposite occurred. Instead of feeling calmer and more prepared, students, parents and teachers became increasingly depressed and anxious, with some exhibiting physiological health issues after the drills. The White House will bring together numerous Cabinet members and experts to collaborate on the guide including Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, Attorney General Merrick Garland, Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, and Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra. The framework to improve active shooter drills will be developed and published within 110 days. The guide will also include how to assist people with disabilities and those with language-related needs, ensuring compliance with civil rights laws when designing and implementing the drills. Biden and Harris delivered remarks about the executive order on Thursday evening.

These proposals are the same of those of Putin. And let us be clear, they are not proposals for peace. Instead, they are proposals for surrender,’ the Democratic nominee for president said. She did not mention Donald Trump by name by her meaning was clear. There were reports Zelensky wanted a sitdown with Trump while he was in the United States for the UN General Assembly meeting. His visit came in the shadow of election-year politics and many want time with the two contenders fighting to be the next occupant of the Oval Office. Instead of a friendly meeting, Zelensky became a target of the former president’s ire. Trump, at a campaign rally in North Carolina earlier this week, slammed Zelensky as ‘probably the greatest salesman on Earth.’ ‘The president of Ukraine is in our country and he’s making little nasty aspersions toward your favorite president, me,’ he told his adoring crowd of MAGA supporters. ‘Any deal — the worst deal — would’ve been better than what we have now,’ Trump said, painting the Ukraine as a lost cause. ‘If they made a bad deal it would’ve been much better. They would’ve given up a little bit and everybody would be living and every building would be built and every tower would be aging for another 2,000 years. ‘What deal can we make? It’s demolished,’ he added. ‘The people are dead. The country is in rubble.’ Ukraine has lost a fifth of its territory and tens of thousands of lives in the conflict. Zelensky is in the United States to persuade officials to his ‘victory plan,’ which includes enhancing Western security guarantees for Ukraine, increasing military aid and securing further financial support. He hasn’t released the full details and wasn’t expected to in his meetings with President Joe Biden and with Harris. Harris has pledged to continue sending military aid to Ukraine if she’s elected president. Trump, however, has been more critical of Zelensky, raising questions about what he will do if he returns to the White House. The vice president, who has met with Zelensky seven times, was clear in her support. ‘My support for the people of Ukraine is unwavering. I have been proud to stand with Ukraine. I will continue to stand with Ukraine, and I will work to ensure Ukraine prevails in this war, to be safe, secure and prosperous,’ she said. ‘Standing with our friends and defending our ideals against tyranny has helped make America the most powerful and prosperous nation in the world. Putin’s aggression is not only an attack on the people of Ukraine, it is also an attack on fundamental principles such as sovereignty and territorial integrity,’ she added. Zelensky spoke after her, saying he looked forward to the conversation and thanking the U.s. for its support. ‘We believe this war can be won and just peace can be close only with it,’ he said. Before his meeting with Harris, Zelensky met with Biden in the Oval Office. ‘Russia will not prevail. Ukraine will prevail, and we’ll continue to stand by you every step of the way,’ Biden said, after thanking him for presenting the so-called victory plan. Zelensky also visited lawmakers on Capitol Hill — where his government said he had also presented his victory plan — and gave a defiant address at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday. The Ukrainian president’s visit to the United States came as Putin upped the stakes, saying that his country should be able to use nuclear weapons if it was attacked by a state that was supported by a nuclear power. ‘It is proposed that aggression against Russia by any nonnuclear state, but with the participation or support of a nuclear state be considered as their joint attack on the Russian Federation,’ Putin said in a meeting at the Kremlin on Wednesday. Zelensky has been pushing for permission to fire more Western-made weapons into the heart of Russia. Western leaders fear Putin will see that as an attack from the West and expand his war. He also has struggled to hold world attention as the war in the Middle East spreads. Israel has increased its attacks into Lebanon as it targets members of Hezbollah. Republicans were also furious Zelensky toured a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, calling it an election year stunt. But the White House defended the visit, telling Republicans to drop the outrage. ‘This came from Ukrainian. Not us,’ press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said of the visit. Zelensky toured the factory with Gov. Josh Shapiro, a top Harris surrogate. Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has called on Zelensky to fire his ambassador to the U.S. for arranging the trip. ‘The Ukrainians asked to visit the facility, which employs American workers, as you know, for manufacturing critical supplies that the Ukrainian military is using every day on the front line of freedom because of its centrality of their to their country’s continued existence,’ Jean-Pierre said. She pointed out Zelensky visited Utah in July and Republicans expressed zero outrage. ‘President Zelensky traveled to Utah and held an event with the Republican governor, a very similar event, and Republican officials were there at that event in Utah, and there wasn’t a single demand, not one, not one single demand for an investigation. ‘This was business as usual for a Ukrainian request during wartime, during wartime. And so I would encourage, we would encourage the House Republicans to drop this. These kind of political stuff, they need to drop this,’ she noted. Overall, the United States has provided around $175 billion in both military and economic assistance to Ukraine.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris insinuated Donald Trump would support Vladimir Putin over Ukraine when&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris Suggests Trump Wants Ukraine to Give In and Connects Him to Putin During Zelensky Meeting first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/kamala-harris-suggests-trump-wants-ukraine-to-give-in-and-connects-him-to-putin-during-zelensky-meeting/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-hints-Trump-wants-Ukraine-to.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 22:55:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.071},{"id":257564454,"title":"Trump To Meet Zelensky Today In New York","text":"Donald Trump said he would meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday in New York, one day after the White House hopeful slammed Ukraine's leader for refusing to strike a deal with Russia over the war.\"President Zelensky has asked to meet with me, and I will be meeting with him tomorrow morning at around 9:45 in Trump Tower,\" the Republican told reporters in New York.\"And it's a shame what's happening in Ukraine.

Newsweek spoke to experts to discuss the matter.During an appearance on CNBC, Cuban called out Trump's proposal to enact tariffs on U.S. companies that move abroad.\"Donald Trump is trying to come in with the hammer and say, 'I'm gonna hit you with a 200 percent tariff, John Deere.' Kamala Harris is saying, 'I'm going to give you incentives to manufacture more.' Which do you think is gonna work better with companies?\" Cuban said.\"Do you want to be underneath a hammer? Because when you put a 200 percent tariff on John Deere and only 20 percent on their Chinese competitors, their Chinese competitors are now less expensive than John Deere.\"Cuban also criticized Trump's manner of responding to policy questions compared to Harris.\"Here's another difference between Kamala and Donald,\" Cuban said. \"Donald says something and everybody tries to explain what he really meant... listen to what Kamala Harris says. What she says is what she's going to do...Donald Trump takes credit for things that didn't even happen.\"Trump has built his platform on promises that Americans would benefit economically, but not everyone is convinced that Trump's proposed policies would be a boom for everyday citizens or even businesses inside the United States.\"Under my plan, incomes will skyrocket, inflation will vanish completely, jobs will come roaring back, and the middle class will prosper like never, ever before,\" Trump said at the Republican National Convention in July.A new report from the Peterson Institute for International Economics found Trump's immigration policies, proposed tariffs and implications for the Federal Reserve would lead to a lower national income, lower employment levels and overall higher inflation.Trump's specific tariff policy, besides his recent 200 percent tariff comments, includes a proposal to increase tariffs on U.S. imports by 10 percentage points and also raise tariffs on U.S. imports from China by 60 percentage points.Other countries are likely to raise their own tariffs in response, and this could lead to a GDP that is 0.9 percent lower by 2026. Inflation in America would also likely grow 1.3 percent in 2025, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Cuban previously called Trump's threat to enact a 200 percent tariff on businesses that move to Mexico \"insane.\"\"This Lack of Understanding of Business is insane,\" the SharkTank investor said earlier this month at Trump's comments specifically directed at the John Deere company.John Deere has laid off hundreds of employees in the United States this year and has also announced it would be moving its cab manufacturing facility to Mexico.\"Deere is constantly reviewing production efficiencies and product/component moves to optimize manufacturing floor space in the U.S. and to leverage the highly skilled production workforce in the U.S. to build our most innovative new machines like the 9RX,\" a spokesperson for John Deere previously told Newsweek.Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign for comment.\"President Trump successfully imposed tariffs and negotiated new trade deals that leveled the playing field for American agriculture and manufacturing, allowing U.S. industries to send more made-in-America goods across the world,\" RNC spokesperson Anna Kelly previously told Newsweek.\"Kamala Harris opposed the USMCA and failed to open foreign markets for our farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers, allowing the trade deficit in goods to reach over $1 trillion a year. Under dealmaker President Trump, American farmers, manufacturers, and auto workers got the best trade deals in history, and he will once again put America First when we send him back to the White House.\"However, Kevin Thompson, a finance expert and the founder and CEO of 9i Capital Group, said Cuban's comments are rooted in \"basic economics\" and Trump's approach could come back onto American consumers.\"Tariffs increase costs, and those costs often get passed on to consumers,\" Thompson told Newsweek. \"Trump's approach to using tariffs as leverage, threatening companies that move operations outside the U.S. with higher costs, aims to encourage domestic investment. However, this tactic may backfire.\"While companies might elect to stay in the U.S., they also might cut jobs in the process to protect their profit margins or move operations abroad while also laying off workers in the process, experts say.\"Cuban has a great point,\" Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek.\"No one wants to see jobs of any kind leave the United States, but there are more effective ways of attempting to retain them than putting a tariff on their products. Not only could, as Cuban mentions, this unintentionally aid equipment manufacturers that unlike John Deere aren't American companies, but in many situations, tariffs of any kind are at least partially passed on to the consumer. \"Michael Ryan, a finance expert and the founder of michaelryanmoney.com, agreed that Cuban's comments \"hit the nail on the head.\"\"Slapping hefty tariffs on imports doesn't just hurt foreign companies - it hits Americans in their wallets. Remember when washing machine prices jumped after tariffs were imposed a few years ago? That's just the tip of the iceberg,\" Ryan told Newsweek.\"As Cuban points out, these policies could actually make it easier for Chinese firms to outcompete American stalwarts like John Deere. It's like tying our own hands behind our backs in a boxing match.\"Harris's policies, meanwhile, have targeted the middle class and unions to boost the economy and have proposed corporate taxes to fund social programs, likely aiming for long-term workforce productivity gains, Ryan said.\"Harris's policies, while not perfect, at least show an understanding of economic cause and effect,\" Ryan said.Still, for both of the competing presidential candidates, economists question where the money is coming from to fund many of their ideas.\"Kamala Harris, on the other hand, is advocating for incentives to encourage domestic manufacturing,\" Thompson said. \"While her approach is different, the key question remains: where will the funding for these incentives come from?\"","summary":"During an appearance on CNBC, Cuban called out Trump's proposal to enact tariffs on US companies that move abroad.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/mark-cuban-warns-trump-plans-put-us-companies-underneath-hammer-1960095","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2481778/mark-cuban.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 22:50:35","author":"Suzanne Blake","authors":["Suzanne Blake"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":257562812,"title":"Laura Loomer Threatens to Sue Anderson Cooper Over Photoshopped Image","text":"Far-right political activist Laura Loomer on Wednesday threatened to sue CNN host Anderson Cooper over a doctored image of her and former President Donald Trump that previously aired on Cooper's show.CNN's Pamela Brown delivered the outlet's on-air apology for featuring the altered image in several segments, acknowledging that on \"Friday evening and on Saturday, CNN aired a number of segments that briefly showed an image of [Trump and Loomer] taken from social media.\"The apology continued, \"On review, this image had been digitally altered by a third party and should not have been included.

In August, Texas removed 1 million people from its list, while in Oregon only 1,200 were taken off the state's rolls.Republicans at state and national levels have raised concerns about voter fraud, claiming non-citizens were eligible to vote, with a lawsuit filed by the GOP alleging just that in North Carolina a few weeks ago.\"Unfortunately, there is a lot of false information out there about our voter rolls and the efforts we undertake to keep them up to date,\" Brinson Bell added. \"As we conduct these processes, we also must comply with state and federal laws and be careful not to remove any eligible voters.\"That issue did arise in Arizona, where a clerical error on citizenship status left nearly 100,000 voters in limbo over whether they would be allowed to vote in state-level elections.Concerns over voter fraud were misplaced, North Carolina's Board of Elections said Thursday, saying voters \"die every day\" but it can take weeks for records to reach officials.

Speaking with ANI, Dhruva Jaishankar said, “I think it was about consolidating a lot that has been done in the past four years by the Quad. That was the main thing. There were a few new initiatives, including the Coast Guard initiative… But largely, I think it was about consolidating those gains.”Notably, to strengthen maritime security, the US Coast Guard, Japan Coast Guard, Australian Border Force, and Indian Coast Guard planned to launch a first-ever Quad-at-Sea Ship Observer Mission in 2025 in the Indo-Pacific to improve interoperability. Through this effort, members of Japan Coast Guard, Australian Border Force, and Indian Coast Guard will spend time on board a US Coast Guard vessel operating in the Indo-Pacific.He further said, “There was also equally, I think, very good coordination with third countries in regions, including Gaza, Ukraine, Yemen, and the South China Sea. So there was a good mention of global developments as well.”Quad is a diplomatic partnership between four countries–Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. US President Joe Biden hosted Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Australian PM Anthony Albanese for the Quad Leaders’ Summit at his hometown Wilmington, Delaware, on September 21. It was the fourth in-person and sixth overall Quad Leaders’ Summit. Apart from taking part in the Quad Summit, PM Modi had bilateral meetings with several leaders, including US President Joe Biden, engaged with the Indian diaspora and important American business leaders and addressed the Summit of the Future at the United Nations.On PM Modi’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Dhruva Jaishankar asserted that India advocates for peace. He said, “India wants peace. I think the longer the war goes on, it’s not in India’s interests, not in many parties’ interests. So I think, what India can do to help facilitate satisfactory outcomes for all sides is appreciated and I think India is one of the few countries that has good relation with Moscow and Kyiv. So, its trying to play a role in facilitating that outcome.”The ORF Executive Director also talked about the upcoming US presidential elections, and emphasised India’s robust ties with both Republicans and Democrats. He said that India’s relationship with the US is unlikely to undergo significant changes regardless of whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris assumes the presidency. “The outcome is too early to determine… India has good relations with both — Republicans and Democrats. I don’t see the relationship fundamentally changing under either Trump or Harris presidency. There will be some shifts… I do think that we should prepare for some minor shifts in emphasis in different types of policies. There will be some shifts with Trump on trade and immigration. There will be some shifts with Kamala Harris also, despite her being a Democrat. The Indian-American community is sizeable and growing. They have a sizeable presence in key states like Georgia and Pennsylvania, among others… Both parties are trying to appeal to Indian-Americans as political donors since they are very wealthy, and in that sense they can play a big role.”The US presidential elections are scheduled to be held on November 5.","summary":"The News Mill","url":"https://thenewsmill.com/2024/09/pm-modis-us-visit-crucial-for-consolidating-quad-progress-dhruva-jaishankar-of-orf/","image":"https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/pm-modis-us-visit-crucial-for-consolidating-quad-progress-dhruva-jaishankar-of-orf.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 22:31:20","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.008},{"id":257562156,"title":"Harris takes aim at Putin alongside Zelenskyy – and makes ‘surrender proposals’ swipe at Trump","text":"Kamala Harris has hit out at opponents making “proposals for surrender” in Ukraine – making a thinly veiled criticism of Donald Trump. The US vice president and Democratic candidate for president said some want Ukraine to strike peace with Russia by accepting neutrality and foregoing security relationships with other nations during a news conference with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. US election latest: Harris takes aim at Putin alongside Zelenskyy “Ukraine has stood up to Russia’s aggression and today Kyiv stands free and strong. President Zelenskyy, I am clear,” she said. “Putin started this war and he could end it tomorrow if he simply withdrew his troops from Ukraine’s sovereign territory.” Hinting at Mr Trump’s recent comments saying Ukraine should have taken “a bad deal,” Ms Harris added: “They are not proposals for peace. Instead, they are proposals for surrender. “The US can not and should not isolate ourselves from the rest of the world. Isolation is not insulation.” Mr Trump has said he will meet with Mr Zelenskyy on Friday in a post on Truth Social. It comes a day after the former president suggested Ukraine should have made concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the months before the war started. At a campaign rally in North Carolina, Mr Trump said: “The worst deal would’ve been better than what we have now. If they made a bad deal, it would’ve been much better. “They would’ve given up a little bit and everybody would be living and every building would be built, and every tower would be ageing for another 2,000 years.” “What deal can we make? It’s demolished,” he added. “The people are dead. The country is in rubble.” Mr Trump has also previously claimed he would end the war in Ukraine the same day he retakes office – but has also condemned Russia’s invasion. Zelenskyy calls for more air defence Meanwhile, Mr Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s air defences need to be “urgently strengthened” to “save thousands of lives and reduce Russian terror to zero”. “We have to end this war, we need a just peace. We must protect our people: Ukrainian families, Ukrainian children and everyone from Putin’s evil,” he said at the White House. His appearance came after a meeting with Joe Biden, where the US president announced a “surge” in military support for Ukraine. The new package includes long-desired glide bombs, air defence kit, and more training for Ukrainian pilots, but it did not come with permission to use long-range missiles against targets inside Russia. Recent weeks have seen Mr Zelenskyy pushing the US and other Western allies for permission to use longer-range missile systems to strike deeper into Russia. So far the Pentagon and White House have not green-lit the loosening of restrictions. There has been hesitation amid concerns over an escalation, which Russia has warned of. With 40 days to go until the election, next for Ms Harris is a visit to a border entry facility in Douglas, Arizona. Sky’s partner network NBC News reported she will receive “official briefings on operations and progress on disrupting the flow of fentanyl through the southern border,” according to an official from her office. Meanwhile, Mr Trump is meeting with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at Trump Tower in New York. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meeting, Sir Keir reiterated he wanted to meet both Mr Trump and Ms Harris ahead of the November vote.","summary":"Kamala Harris has hit out at opponents making &#8220;proposals for surrender&#8221; in Ukraine &#8211; making a thinly veiled criticism of Donald Trump.

Hispanic also. They’re suffering, and the families are suffering.” “They go out, they think they have a job, and they've lost a job to an illegal migrant,” he continued. Trump was widely criticized after his debate with Joe Biden in June when he accused immigrants of “taking Black jobs.” He repeated the phrase at the National Association of Black Journalists’ annual convention in July. The former president’s assertion that certain roles are “Black jobs” attracted plenty of controversy. Michelle Obama poked fun at Trump at the Democratic National Convention in August when she said, “Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those 'Black jobs’?” the former first lady said. Asked at the NABJ convention to define a “Black job,” Trump sparked laughter when he said, \"A Black job is anybody that has a job. That's what it is.\" Economists have routinely suggested that immigrants have little effect on native employment. Unemployment among Black Americans remains low. Still, the attack has been a frequent theme of Trump’s recent stump speeches as he attempts to attract Black voters. Though Kamala Harris holds a wide lead with this group, Trump has made inroads. On Thursday, Black pastors in Detroit joined a roundtable outreach event hosted by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. On Friday, the only Black Republican in the Senate, Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) is set to host a Black empowerment financial literacy event on behalf of the Trump campaign.","summary":"David Dee Delgado/ReutersDonald Trump ranted about Black jobs again at a Thursday press conference in New York City.\n\n“All of these people coming in are horrible for the Black population and the Hispanic population,” the former president said, occasionally appearing to reference prepared remarks. “They're taking the jobs of the Black population at levels that they've never seen before.
