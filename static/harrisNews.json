{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":3900,"news":[{"id":255574796,"title":"RFK Jr. supporters could tip the scales for Trump in Wisconsin —or not","text":"WATERTOWN, Wis.—The Wisconsin Election Commission’s decision to keep Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. on the ballot in Wisconsin may have complied with the letter of state law but, the spirit couldn’t have been more partisan. Mere moments before insisting that RFK Jr. had to stay on the ballot, despite his request to be removed, Democratic Elections Commission Chair Ann Jacobs fought to kick all of the ballot-qualified third parties off the ballot based on her unprecedented reading of state law — and the Democratic National Committee’s. The purpose, of course, was to remove the Green Party’s Jill Stein from the ballot, whose share of 30,000 votes in 2016 has been blamed for Hillary Clinton’s loss in Wisconsin. While Stein’s polling in the state in August showed a mere 1% vote capture — still enough to tip the presidential election scales in the Badger State — Kennedy’s polling was a whopping 8% in one statewide poll. Popular opinion is that Kennedy’s supporters will favor Trump this fall after anti-vax advocates endorsed the former president. When third-party candidates are added to polling in Wisconsin, Trump usually slides behind Harris by 2 percentage points in what is otherwise a razor-sharp 1% margin. How the math will play out at the ballot box for Trump in the battleground state is up for debate, but some RFK Jr. supporters shared their voting plans with The Post. S.M. is a college student in Milwaukee who doesn’t typically vote Democrat but was very impressed with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “good ideas” and “clear-minded” message. “Bobby didn’t have a chance,” S.M. told The Post, irritated by what she sees as the hypocrisy of the Democratic Party. ”Harris didn’t win her primary. They just popped Kamala in there. That is not a democracy. It’s a dictatorship.” The 27-year-old said she has some concerns about Trump but she will likely vote for him. Dr. Tamika Johnson, 46, an educator from Milwaukee, had planned to vote for Kennedy but changed her mind after RFK Jr. endorsed Trump and ended his own presidential bid. “I won’t support [RFK] or Trump. I’m choosing to vote for the Libertarian Party,” Dr. Johnson told The Post. “I’m pleased that the real nature and goal of RFK were uncovered. It seems RFK is after a position and is primarily looking out for his own interest, which is why I’m choosing to stop supporting him.” Ericka, a 38-year-old artist and property investor, plans to vote for Kennedy in November, although her vote is not set in stone in this volatile election year. “Under no circumstances would I vote for Kamala,” she told The Post. Ericka voted “liberal-Democrat” most of her adult life, until 2016 when the Democratic Party’s treatment of Bernie Sanders made her realize “my values no longer aligned with the Democratic Party.” The Watertown, Wis. resident wants to help the “We The People” party reach the 5% threshold of votes to qualify for public funding, and vote on the issues most important to her, including “children’s health, the chronic disease epidemic, free speech and the environment.” Joe Handrick, an election analyst who keeps close tabs on Wisconsin’s election data, thinks Trump gets a small but potentially significant bump from RFK Jr. supporters in Wisconsin. “I think it does make a difference,” Handrick told The Post. “If he’s getting four or five percent, how does that get divvied up?” Handrick estimated with Kennedy on the Wisconsin ballot, half of the environmental lawyer’s supporters will still check the ballot for him rather than support either of the two top party candidates. Where does that leave things with the other half of RFK Jr.’s supporters? Handrick gives Trump 60% of Kennedy’s leftover vote compared to Harris’ 40%. With the current polling averages in Wisconsin, that breaks down to Harris’ advantage by 1.4%. That matches the RealClearPolitics polling average for the second half of August, which puts Harris at +1.4 in the state.","summary":"The Wisconsin Election Commission's decision to keep Robert F.

It was announced in early July that Nuzzi, New York Magazine's star Washington correspondent, would be hosting a six-episode interview series called \"Working Capital,\" in which she interviewed prominent people in the political and business world. The announcement came just days after Nuzzi penned a bombshell story putting a spotlight on the \"conspiracy of silence\" surrounding Biden's mental decline and the first episode was released on July 17. Semafor reported Sunday that Bloomberg shelved its \"splashy PR rollout\" for Nuzzi's show \"in response to a small Twitter campaign against the journalist by Democrats.\" According to Semafor, after her article, online liberal critics circulated early 2010s tweets she wrote joking about conspiracy theories targeting then-President Obama, claiming they were evidence of racism and demanded Bloomberg fire her. WILD NEW YORK MAG FEATURES DETAILS ‘CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE’ TO HIDE BIDEN'S ‘MENTAL DECLINE’ FROM AMERICA Nuzzi said she was \"disappointed\" by Bloomberg's response to the far-left mob in a statement to Fox News Digital, which she previously provided to Semafor. \"When I write something that agitates the right, I am accused of being a liberal activist. When I write something that agitates the left, I am accused of being a conservative activist,\" Nuzzi said. \"The difference is that mainstream media organizations tend to ignore bad-faith campaigns against reporters led by the right. I have no illusions about massive corporate media entities and their tolerance for even the faintest murmurs of a PR crisis, so I can’t say I was surprised, but I was disappointed.\" NEW YORK MAG REPORTER DEFENDS TIMING OF BIDEN ‘CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE’ BOMBSHELL AMID BACKLASH Nuzzi addressed her old X posts, saying, \"I know a lot of reporters who long ago made the shrewd decision to delete all of their old posts to protect themselves. I would never judge anyone for doing that. But a large part of my project as a journalist is to meet people where they live in gray areas and to run toward complication and nuance, and to understand context as it is or as it was, and I see an effort to conceal jokes I made in the context of the internet of five or 10 or 15 years ago as a kind of dishonesty that I am not comfortable engaging in.\" \"I really believe that if you want to live in a world that is forgiving and where people hold even those they disagree with to the same standards they wish to be held, you can’t cave to mob pressure as a means to protect yourself even when it would be a lot easier to do so,\" Nuzzi said. \"That’s how this type of culture is formed and maintained and as individuals we get to decide if we think it’s worth enduring a little pain to fight against it.\" Additionally, Nuzzi told Fox News Digital she had not heard from Bloomberg since Semafor's report and added, \"The only response I would like from Bloomberg is for them to show a little more courage in their future endeavors.\" \"Working Capital,\" which featured interviews with New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Gov. Chris Sununu, R-N.H., Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Mark Cuban, concluded on August 15. It is unclear whether Nuzzi's show will be renewed for a second season. Bloomberg did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. Nuzzi's shocking July report said the subject of Biden's mental decline \"was like a dark family secret for many elite supporters.\" Nuzzi noted that she began hearing similar stories from \"Democratic officials, activists, and donors\" in January about concerns related to Biden’s age and cognitive ability. \"Following encounters with the president, they had arrived at the same concern: Could he really do this for another four years? Could he even make it to Election Day? Uniformly, these people were of a similar social strata. They lived and socialized in Washington, New York, and Los Angeles. They did not wish to come forward with their stories. They did not want to blow a whistle,\" Nuzzi told readers.

Longtime friends of the Biden family, who spoke to me on the condition of anonymity, were shocked to find that the president did not remember their names,\" Nuzzi wrote. \"At a White House event last year, a guest recalled, with horror, realizing that the president would not be able to stay for the reception because, it was clear, he would not be able to make it through the reception. The guest wasn’t sure they could vote for Biden, since the guest was now open to an idea that they had previously dismissed as right-wing propaganda: The president may not really be the acting president after all.\" The controversy over Biden's mental decline erupted following his disastrous debate performance in June and ultimately resulted in his exit from the presidential race, prompting Vice President Kamala Harris to quickly emerge as the Democratic nominee.","summary":"According to Semafor, Bloomberg scrapped its &quot;splashy PR rollout&quot; of a new show hosted by journalist Olivia Nuzzi after left-wing backlash she faced as a result of her Biden reporting.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/bloomberg-scrapped-pr-rollout-olivia-nuzzis-show-after-leftwing-backlash-following-her-damning-biden-story","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/09/931/523/NuzziBiden.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-04 00:00:08","author":"Joseph Wulfsohn","authors":["Joseph Wulfsohn"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":255574570,"title":"Harris adopted ‘Union Joe’s’ playbook, but this member isn’t buying it: ‘Kamala is reading off a script’","text":"PITTSBURGH – Vice President Kamala Harris’ Labor Day message to union workers in Pennsylvania failed to resonate with at least one Yinzer, who found her speech unconvincing and insincere. “They haven’t earned my vote,” Shawn Cribs Jr. told The Post after leaving the event at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 5 union hall. “It feels like Kamala is reading off a script,” the 20-year-old IBEW brother said. Cribs, while crediting Biden’s spending on infrastructure for helping rebuild a bridge that collapsed during one of the 81-year-old president’s previous Pittsburgh visits, said inflation has his undecided vote leaning toward former President Donald Trump. “I’m dumb. I’m just a guy. I don’t care about the charts,” he said. “People need to see the results first-hand to understand why they need to vote for a certain president.” Cribs noted that he saw gas and groceries get more expensive under Biden, whether or not he’s to blame. “We all slave and work to make money and I think what’s most important is making money,” he said, whether you’re poor or a billionaire. To be clear, nearly all of the IBEW members were big fans of the Harris-Biden double billing — jumping up in their seats and cheering for the rally. In her remarks, Harris tried to re-tread many of President Biden’s union-friendly lines and past achievements. She even copied Trump’s pledge to block the sale of US Steel to Japan – while avoiding any mention of the record-high inflation and soaring food and gas prices under the Harris-Biden administration. The 59-year-old vice president also didn’t get into specifics about what executive actions she would undertake to back unions, only declaring her support for Protecting the Right to Organize Act – congressional legislation that would override state “right to work” laws that make union membership voluntary – and vaguely vowing to “end union busting once and for all.” “She’s speaking the language she learned under Joe Biden,” Dennis Roddy, a Pittsburgh GOP strategist, told The Post. “She just proved that you don’t have to say anything new to get a reaction that seems so new to people after the experience of being abandoned by the ‘New Democrats’ going back to Gary Hart in 1984.” Harris followed Biden on the stage in Pittsburgh and Roddy said the two speeches were “indistinguishable.” “Kamala needed to send a signal to labor that she would be a continuation of [Biden’s] policies in the areas that interest them,” Roddy argued. David McCall, international president of United Steelworkers, told The Post that he believes Harris’ policies can win over rank-and-file union members, who tend to be more open to Trump than union leaders — as long as the campaign is “talking to people and making sure that it is a simple, easy message.” But even McCall, who’s endorsed Harris for president, stumbled trying to articulate parts of the Democratic nominee’s vision for an “opportunity economy.” “If you read some of the policy papers she’s already put out about an opportunist, an opportunistic economy …” he said.","summary":"“They haven’t earned my vote,” Shawn Cribs Jr. told The Post after leaving the event at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 5 union hall. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/03/us-news/harris-adopted-union-joes-playbook-but-this-union-member-isnt-buying-it-it-feels-like-kamala-is-reading-off-a-script/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/2024-harris-biden-appealing-labor-88846084.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/G2IhRhLZ-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-03 23:58:48","author":"Ethan Dodd,Victor Nava","authors":["Ethan Dodd","Victor Nava"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":255574028,"title":"New York man sentenced after thousands of harassing calls to Congress and threat to kill staffer","text":"A New York man was sentenced Tuesday to 13 months in prison in connection with threatening phone calls he made to members of Congress and a threat to kill a staffer. The sentencing of Ade Salim Lilly, 35, included three years supervised release, the Justice Department said in a news release. Lilly's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. Lilly pleaded guilty in May to interstate communications with a threat to kidnap or injure, and making repeated threatening phone calls. Beginning in February 2022, he made more than 12,000 calls from Maryland and Puerto Rico, to the offices of congressional lawmakers before he was arrested in Puerto Rico in November 2023, according to court documents. Federal prosecutors said that during the calls, Lilly would berate congressional staffers and \"become angry and use vulgar and harassing language towards the individual who answered the phone\" when he was informed that the staffer couldn't help him. During one call on Oct. 21, 2022, Lilly told a congressional staffer, “I will kill you, I am going to run you over, I will kill you with a bomb or grenade,” prosecutors said. Over two days in February 2023, Lilly called the Washington, D.C., office of one lawmaker more than 500 times, prosecutors said. In a sentencing memo seeking 18 months imprisonment, prosecutors referred to rising threats against elected officials. \"This is an election year, and more and more often, criticism of a political position or viewpoint crosses the First Amendment line and leads to true threats of violence,\" they wrote. \"The pervasive rise in threats against elected officials creates a real risk that expressions of violence will become normalized.\" Last month, a Virginia man was charged with making a series of death threats on a conservative social media site against Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. Former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, have also faced social media threats. In July, a Florida man was charged with written threats to kill Trump and Vance.","summary":"Ade Salim Lilly pleaded guilty in May to interstate communications with a threat to kidnap or injure, and making repeated threatening phone calls.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/new-york-man-sentenced-prison-harassing-calls-congress-threat-kill-sta-rcna169452","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-09/240903-capitol-building-ew-549p-78599c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-03 23:43:47","author":"Zoë Richards","authors":["Zoë Richards"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.338},{"id":255574370,"title":"Progress toward Gaza cease-fire in peril after Israeli hostage deaths","text":"Since abandoning his reelection bid, Biden has viewed achieving a cease-fire deal before the election as a sure way to bolster his own legacy — and to help Vice President Kamala Harris’ chances this November, the officials said. A Harris win would also burnish Biden’s chapter in the history books. And the president grew particularly emotional after the death this weekend of an American citizen, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who had been held captive in the Gaza tunnels, the officials said. Biden was moved by Polin’s parents, who made an emotional plea at the DNC last month, and he told aides that their months of worry followed by sudden grief reminded him of the excruciatingly slow loss to cancer of his own son, Beau. Meanwhile, tensions between Israel and Hamas appear to be mounting. Following the hostage deaths Sunday, Netanyahu made a speech, saying he would not compromise on the issue of the Philadelphi Corridor and batted down any suggestion that he was not prioritizing bringing Israelis home from Gaza. “If we do leave [the Philadelphi Corridor], we may not return for 42 years,” he said. “This corridor is different from all the other places — it is central, it determines all of our future.” Hamas on Sunday released video footage of the six hostages who were killed, vowing to release more in the coming days, including what the group has described as their “last messages.” At the same time, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have come out in protest across Israeli cities, urging the government to reach a cease-fire deal quickly and bring the remaining hostages home alive. On Monday, U.S. officials were still adamant that a deal is possible, but they backed off their previously confident rhetoric that an agreement was close. “I can’t guarantee a certain outcome, we just believe it is an outcome that is possible,” said National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby. “It’s not optimism. It is pragmatism.” Kirby defended the administration’s past statements, saying they “were accurate.” “But we also never said it was going to be easy,” he said. “I can’t tell you what the timeline looks like.” Eric Bazail-Eimil contributed to this report.

She’s set to unveil the plan during a campaign stop in the Portsmouth area of New Hampshire — marking a rare deviation from the Midwestern and Sunbelt battlegrounds the Democrat has focused on in her race against former Republican President Donald Trump. A Harris campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a policy plan that hadn’t been released publicly, said Tuesday the change would cover the $40,000 it costs on average to start a business. The proposal would let new businesses wait to claim that deduction until they first turn a profit, to better maximize its impact lowering their taxes. Such changes would likely require congressional approval. But a series of tax cuts approved during the Trump administration are set to expire at the end of next year, setting up a scenario where lawmakers may be ready to consider new tax policies. The proposal can help Harris show her support for entrepreneurs even as she’s called for higher corporate tax rates. Since President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid and endorsed Harris in July, the vice president has focused on campaigning in the “ blue wall ” states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that have been the centerpiece of Democratic campaigns that have won the White House in recent decades. She’s also frequently visited Arizona, Nevada and Georgia, all of which Biden narrowly won in 2020, and North Carolina, which last voted Democratic in a presidential race in 2008 but which she’s still hoping to flip from Trump. Biden won New Hampshire by 7 percentage points in 2020, though Trump came far closer to winning it against Hillary Clinton in 2016. “The cost of living in New Hampshire is through the roof, their energy bills are some of highest in the country, and their housing market is the most unaffordable in history,” Trump posted last week on his social media platform. Harris’ team says securing 25 million new business applications in four years if she wins the White House would exceed the roughly 19 million such applications filed since Biden took office. And those were millions more than the previous four years under Trump. The vice president’s goal would be a record for new small business applications — but records only go back about 20 years. Applications to start a business don’t always translate to small businesses actually being formed. Still, Harris’ plan could keep new small businesses that do come to fruition from otherwise incurring more debt which, at a time of high interest rates, might help them better succeed. In the weeks since Harris took over the top of the Democratic ticket, she has offered relatively few major policy proposals — attempting to strike a political balance between injecting new energy into the race and continuing to support many of the Biden administration proposals she helped champion as vice president. Harris’ small business plan follows her announcing last month proposed steps to fight inflation by working to lower grocery prices, and to use tax cuts and other incentives to encourage homeownership. The vice president has also proposed ending federal taxes on tips to service industry workers, an idea Trump proposed first. The plan she’s introducing Wednesday further calls for developing a standard deduction for small businesses meant to save their owners time when doing their taxes, and making it easier to get occupational licenses — letting people work across state lines and businesses expand into new states. Harris also wants to offer federal incentives so state and local government will ease their regulations. In an effort to spur business investment outside urban and suburban hubs, Harris is pledging to launch a small business expansion fund to enable community banks and federal entities to cover interest costs while small businesses are expanding or otherwise creating jobs. Her team says those efforts will focus especially on areas that traditionally receive less investment.","summary":"The proposal can help Harris show her support for entrepreneurs even as she’s called for higher corporate tax rates.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2024/09/03/harris-to-propose-tenfold-startup-tax-incentive-increase-she-says-will-spur-small-business-creation/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AP24246814919308.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-03 23:31:54","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":255573748,"title":"Harris to propose tenfold startup tax incentive increase she says will spur small business creation","text":"By WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris plans to propose on Wednesday a tenfold increase in federal tax incentives for small business startup expenses, from $5,000 to $50,000, hoping to help spur a record 25 million new small business applications over her four-year term should she win the presidency in November.

This is a very manipulative and misleading article designed to paint a negative picture of the encampment sweeps. As a caseworker for a homeless nonprofit, I’ve worked with many homeless vets to replace their DD-214s and it’s a simple process with at least 10 organizations in the Bay Area and many online platforms that can assist for no charge. I have no doubt Erin Spencer has access to this support, especially as a vet, and if honorably discharged then he will qualify for the many housing opportunities made available just for vets. I believe his 10 years on the streets have nothing to do with a lack of attention and resources, and these sweeps are necessary for folks like Spencer, who need exactly this kind of structure. So please stop with these false narratives about the homeless. They serve no one except the advocates. Diana Bik Boeck Fremont Trump’s fingerprints are on Afghanistan debacle Re: “Trump tries to tie Harris to the Afghanistan withdrawal” (Page A3, Aug. 27). Donald Trump is trying to blame Kamala Harris for the chaotic Afghan exit while ignoring his own culpability. There’s no reason to think the Afghans wouldn’t have rushed the airfield or that ISIS wouldn’t have sent a suicide bomber if Trump had still been president. Americans who didn’t leave stayed of their own volition. The Taliban was actually helping Americans leave; they wanted them out too. The military equipment left behind was the equipment we gave to the Afghan army who deserted their posts after the collapse of the Afghan government — thank you, Trump. The real failure was the disastrous deal Trump made with the Taliban, who didn’t keep their end of the agreement. Trump’s withdrawal agreement with the Taliban excluded the Afghan government and freed 5,000 imprisoned Taliban soldiers even though the Taliban continued to attack Afghan government forces and welcomed al-Qaeda terrorists to thrive in the country. Frank Grygus San Ramon Media doesn’t paint accurate Harris portrait Re: “Trump aims for ‘manoverse’ vote” and “Takeways from Harris’ interview” (Page A4, Aug. 31). New York Times reporter Reid Epstein pans Kamala Harris’ interview responses as “risk averse,” “discursive” or rambling. For example, he criticizes Harris for not taking the bait on the “Day 1” question, presumably preferring that she would brag about “Day 1” executive orders like Donald Trump would. Instead of “dodging” such a symbolic and silly question, she provided a clear statement of her values and priorities. Asked about her feelings when Biden called, instead of “rambling” or “avoiding” she replied, “To be honest” she thought about him first. Epstein is apparently unable to credit that a person of integrity could truly feel concern and empathy for the president before focusing on herself. Objectively compare Trump’s rambling, deceitful and exaggerated interview responses with Harris and you will clearly see in Harris a thoughtful, values-driven leader who actually puts service to others first. Why does the New York Times consistently try to blur that image? Jamie Harris Lafayette Harris’ economic plans show that she’s unfit Several letters have questioned Donald Trump’s fitness for office. But what of Kamala Harris’s fitness? Her economic proposals are a disaster waiting to happen. They include: • Raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%: This 33% tax hike would make American businesses less competitive globally. • Raising the capital gains tax rate to match the personal rate: This move would nearly double the capital gains tax rate, creating a huge disincentive to invest in America. • Ending the step-up in basis for estates: Harris wants to increase the death tax. • Taxing unrealized capital gains: Harris wants to tax gains in property and investments before they are realized. Harris has a lack of understanding of basic economics. She’s not fit to serve.

The Democratic presidential nominee will travel to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on Wednesday where she will announce a new goal for a record 25 million new business applications during her first term if elected. The proposal includes expanding the startup expense deduction for small businesses by tenfold from $5,000 to $50,000. Her latest pitch comes just weeks after Harris traveled to North Carolina last month to give her first policy address as the presidential nominee, an economic speech in Raleigh. There she announced her plan to tackle rising prices including a controversial plan to ban price gouging as well as steps to address housing affordability. With the expansion of the startup expense deduction, Harris will also call for small businesses to be able to wait to claim the deduction until after they turn a profit in an effort to reduce their taxes. According to the campaign, this would mean a small business with $15,000 in earnings its first year would be able to deduct that and then save the rest for future years and small businesses who have losses in the first year would be able to wait until later years to claim the deduction. The proposal is the latest part of what Harris is calling her ‘Opportunity Economy’ as she claims helping the middle class will be a top goal of her presidency starting on Day One. It costs an estimated $30,000 to $40,000 for startup and first year costs to start a small business in the United States, so expanding the deduction could provide much relief. However, it is not yet clear how much the proposal would cost the government or impact the national debt. Other components of the vice president’s economic plan would cost $1.7 trillion, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated. The campaign said proposals beyond 2025 budget levels would be offset by increased taxes on corporations and high earners. Harris has backed tax hikes from the Biden administration including raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% and raising the tax on stock buybacks to 4% from 1%. Like the president, the vice president has vowed not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000. Any changes to tax policy must go through Congress, but lawmakers are facing a looming deadline with the expiration of some tax cuts next year from the law passed when Donald Trump was in office. The new goal Harris is setting for 25 million new business applications during her first term would exceed the current 19 million record, which was set during the Biden administration. On Wednesday, the vice president will also pitch several other efforts the campaign believes will cut red tape and make it easier for small businesses. They include developing a standard deduction for small businesses to save time and money, make it easier to obtain occupational licenses and incentivize state and local governments to make their own regulation changes to benefit small businesses. At the same time, Harris will call for helping existing small businesses through several steps. Among them, the vice president will aim to ensure one in three federal contract dollars go to small businesses during her first term. She will also call for a fund that help community development financial institutions (CDFIs) cover interest costs for small businesses expanding to locations and creating jobs in areas that have historically received fewer investments. Harris’ latest proposals come as the campaign has also taken to the airwaves with a series of ads highlighting her economic policy proposals in key states she needs to win come November. The vice president makes the economic pitch as recent polls show her in a tight race with Donald Trump, but when it comes to the issues, more voters have signaled they trust the Republican presidential nominee to handle the economy and inflation which skyrocketed coming out of the coronavirus pandemic.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is set to unveil a proposal to massively&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris suggests a significant tax break for over 25 million small businesses first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kamala-harris-suggests-a-significant-tax-break-for-over-25-million-small-businesses/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-proposes-huge-new-tax-deduction.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-03 23:20:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.102},{"id":255573072,"title":"John McCain’s son Jimmy plans to vote for Kamala Harris, rebukes Trump’s Arlington debacle","text":"Lt. Jimmy McCain, son of late Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain, rebuked former President Donald Trump’s visit to Arlington Cemetery last week and revealed that he is now a registered Democrat who plans to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. The McCain scion, who has spent over 17 years in the military, lambasted Trump for a “violation,” accusing the Republican presidential candidate of using the nation’s largest cemetery as a campaign event. “It’s a sacred area. There’s three generations of McCains that are buried there. It’s a violation,” he told CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper” Tuesday. “The people who are buried there don’t have an opinion. “When you make it political, you take away the respect of the people who are there.” In a separate interview with CNN, Jimmy McCain, 36, underscored his disgust at the ordeal. “It just blows me away,” he told CNN. “These men and women that are laying in the ground there have no choice” in the matter. “I just think that for anyone who’s done a lot of time in their uniform, they just understand that inherently — that it’s not about you there. It’s about these people who gave the ultimate sacrifice in the name of their country.” Last week, Trump visited the country’s largest national cemetery to pay tribute to the 13 US service members who were killed in Abbey Gate after an ISIS-K suicide bomber detonated an explosive in 2021 during the chaotic withdrawal from the war-torn nation. Trump’s stop in the cemetery came during the three-year anniversary of that attack and he laid a wreath to honor the fallen. He later posed for photos with Gold Star families at the cemetery. That sparked swift backlash. While there isn’t a ban on taking photos at Arlington Cemetery, there are restrictions against “partisan political activities” there. An Army spokesperson blasted the Trump campaign and alleged that “ANC employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside.” Trump has denied accusations of a “conflict” at the cemetery. In the late 1990s, the late Sen. McCain (R-Ariz.) was forced to apologize after a campaign ad showed him walking in Arlington Cemetery in violation of that bar on political activity there. “You don’t spend that long in politics without messing up once or twice,” his son said. “If Donald Trump pulled it down and apologized, I mean, it would be the right thing to do.” However, citing Trump’s “history towards veterans,” the McCain scion argued that the 45th president wouldn’t “earn any points back” with him by apologizing for the ordeal. Early on during this 2016 presidential campaign, Trump infamously bashed Sen. McCain. “He’s a war hero because he was captured; I like people that weren’t captured,” he said. John McCain is widely regarded as a war hero, who was captured during the Vietnam War, tortured, and turned down a chance at an early release. He later helped normalize relations with Vietnam. Trump and the McCain family have feuded bitterly ever since. “I’ve never forgotten it,” he reflected on that flap. “To hear those things said about him, I can never forgive.” Jimmy McCain also revealed that several weeks ago, he switched his party affiliation from independent to Democrat, despite his family’s longstanding history with the GOP, including his father being the 2008 Republican presidential nominee. “I was gone for a year, so I didn’t have a chance to change,” he said. “I care about my family. I care about equal rights of everyone in this country. I care about all this. “I decided that it was time to move on.” Not everyone in his family agrees with the move. Meghan McCain, 39, put out a statement stressing that she has no intention of voting for either Harris or Trump. “I greatly respect the wide variety of political opinions of all of my family members and love them all very much. I however, remain a proud member of the Republican Party and hope for brighter days ahead. (Not voting for Harris or Trump, hope that clears things up),” she posted on X. Jimmy McCain also told CNN that he “would get involved in any way I could” to help get Harris over the finish line come Nov. 5. Harris and her campaign have been keen on spotlighting Republican defectors, including recently over 200 former Bush and McCain alumni who endorsed her. She’s also indicated that she’d put a Republican in her Cabinet.","summary":"Jimmy McCain also told CNN that he \"would get involved in any way I could” to help get Harris over the finish line come Nov. 5.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/03/us-news/john-mccains-son-jimmy-to-vote-for-kamala-harris-slams-trumps-arlington-appearance/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-j3ia3qdqv-1725399323467.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1725384973&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/q5JnU3CV-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-03 23:15:43","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.168},{"id":255573074,"title":"China made a fool out of Kathy Hochul and Harris-Biden —but don’t expect much of a response","text":"China has made a complete fool out of Gov. Hochul (and Andrew Cuomo, too), per a new indictment of one of their top aides on espionage charges by US Attorney Breon Peace. Shouldn’t Hochul be screaming at the top of her lungs — and demanding strong federal action against Beijing? Heck, the Harris-Biden administration shouldn’t even need prodding: China placed an agent in the Executive Chamber of New York state government. Doesn’t that merit the expulsion of key Chinese officials, at the least? Where else are China’s spies operating? Linda Sun, a former top aide to Hochul who’d also worked for Gov. Andrew Cuomo, faces federal charges, along with husband Chris Hu, of violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money-laundering conspiracy. “While appearing to serve the people of New York as deputy chief of staff within the New York State executive chamber, the defendant and her husband actually worked to further the interests of the Chinese government,” charged Peace. “The illicit scheme enriched the defendant’s family to the tune of millions of dollars.” Sun acted “at the request” of Chinese officials and the Chinese Communist Party in “numerous political activities” — blocking Taiwanese representatives from meeting with top state officials, changing state messages to please Beijing, obtaining proclamations for Chinese representatives without authorization and arranging meetings for Chinese delegations. In return, Sun and Hu got millions from Beijing, using the funds to buy homes now valued at a whopping $6.2 million, cars (including a 2024 Ferrari) and other items. Clearly, China sees officials like Kamala Harris, Joe Biden and Hochul as pushovers: Remember when Beijing sent a spy balloon across America — with nary a peep from Harris Biden? Alas, don’t expect them to do anything different this time. Hochul, incidentally, ignored warnings about CCP influence operations. Despite media reports about the Sino-American Friendship Association’s ties to the CCP, for instance, senior Hochul aide Elaine Fan last year attended “An Evening of Chinese Culture” sponsored by the group and the Mets, National Review’s Jimmy Quinn reported. The feds had warned local officials that China seeks relationships with them to promote its agenda, noting that locals “risk being manipulated” by CCP “influence operations” and calling them “deceptive and coercive.” And China’s agenda is indisputably evil: Beijing has persecuted and murdered Uyghurs, threatened its Pacific neighbors, repressed its own people and even targeted foes on US soil. Yet Hochul has bragged of the “beautiful relationship between our countries,” calling them “amazing partners” with whom “we continue to work together collaboratively.” She even praised Chinese Consul-General Huang Ping — a CCP hardliner who the feds say oversees organized harassment against critics here and who appears to be PRC Official-1 in the indictment — as an “old friend,” per Quinn. No wonder one of her top aides allegedly got away with spying for China. Nor is there much doubt Harris and Biden will remain mute about it, emboldening the Chinese Communists to grow even more aggressive. Blame their naiveté — or that trademark Harris-Biden fear of escalation; either way, the prospects for America are terrifying.","summary":"China has made a complete fool out of Gov.

On Tuesday, Trump breathed more life into the story when he pushed back on assertions made by the press and the U.S. Army itself that members of his staff had engaged in an altercation with ANC personnel. “The was no conflict or ‘fighting’ at Arlington National Cemetery last week. It was a made-up story by Comrade Kamala and her misinformation squad. She made it all up to make up for the fact that she and Sleepy Joe have BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS for the INCOMPETENT AFGHANISTAN Withdrawal – THE MOST EMBARRASSING DAY IN U.S. HISTORY!!!” Trump wrote via his Truth Social media platform. Trump’s stance comes after he was apparently invited to Arlington for an August 26 wreath-laying ceremony, which itself came on the three-year anniversary of the deaths of 13 American service members working to facilitate a speedy and hectic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan after nearly two decades at war. The visit drew the ire of veterans and military supporters alike after Trump’s campaign shared images of him standing over the graves of our nation’s most recently fallen military members while smiling and flashing a thumbs up for the camera. The area of the cemetery Trump was visiting, Section 60, strictly prohibits photography. That thumbs-up image and video taken of the event and later shared by the Trump campaign team were both prohibited by Army regulation and federal law. “Participants in the August 26th ceremony and the subsequent Section 60 visit were made aware of federal laws, Army regulations and DoD policies, which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds,” an Army spokesperson said in a statement. They said Arlington National Cemetery holds thousands of wreath-laying ceremonies each year. All of those were carried out without a problem until last week. “An ANC employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside. Consistent with the decorum expected at ANC, this employee acted with professionalism and avoided further disruption,” they said. Despite Trump’s claim the event did not take place, the Army said a report was filed with the relevant police agency, though no charges will be forthcoming. “The incident was reported to the JBM-HH police department, but the employee subsequently decided not to press charges. Therefore, the Army considers this matter closed,” they said. Trump has said he was invited to be at the event by the grieving families, and that they gave permission for his staff to film and photograph his visit. Even if that is the case, Trump, his staff, and Gold Star families do not have the authority to suspend Army regulation or U.S. law as they see fit. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee to the presidency, took to social media over the weekend to lambaste Trump’s use of the nation’s most hallowed ground for political purposes. On Tuesday, her campaign pointed out that this week is the four-year anniversary of Trump’s infamous “suckers” and “losers” comments, which he allegedly made to gold-star father and four-star Gen. John Kelly while refusing to visit a WWI cemetery in Europe. “We should never forget that Donald Trump disparaged our fallen service members as ‘suckers’ and ‘losers.’ Even all these years later, it remains shocking, disturbing, and simply un-American. No one seeking America’s highest office should ever talk about our fallen heroes this way. It’s disqualifying. Trump has repeatedly attacked and demeaned our service members, veterans, and military families, and his reckless policies threaten to gut their hard-earned benefits,” Harris-Walz 2024 Spokesperson Joseph Costello said in a statement.","summary":"On Tuesday, Trump breathed more life into the story when he pushed back on assertions made by the press and the U.S. Army itself that members of his staff had engaged in an altercation with ANC personnel.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/09/03/he-said-they-said-trump-says-no-fighting-at-arlington-u-s-army-says-otherwise/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Election_2024_Trump_23257_3f0739.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-03 23:11:17","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.277},{"id":255572836,"title":"Son of John McCain Says Trump Team’s Cemetery Clash Violated ‘Sacred Place’","text":"A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, Karoline Leavitt, said in a statement that there “has been no greater advocate for our brave military men and women than President Trump.” She added that Mr. Trump had avoided starting wars and putting “our troops in harm’s way.” Mr. McCain, who also criticized the Trump campaign’s actions in an interview with CNN published earlier Tuesday, told The Times that he planned to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.

San Jose in 1951 decided the maintenance of the street trees must be paid by the property owners, not the city. Your article does a wonderful job of showing the beetle’s risk to these trees, but shouldn’t we mention the knock-on financial risk to San Jose property owners for the resulting tree removals (and replacements)?

Fans who have paid dearly for their tickets cannot even sit in their expensive seats because the sun is beating down on them and it is roaring hot. Super hot weather is here to stay. Skin cancer is on the rise, too, and sitting in the blazing sun for hours is lethal. Shading those expensive seats is way more important than upgrading the luxury suites. The World Cup will be held in June and July of 2026. Fans better hope those games are held after sundown. Otherwise, those traveling from far away and paying a pile of money for their tickets will not be pleased. The stories about their experience likely won’t make Levi’s Stadium look good.

In Japan, there is a zero-tolerance policy for drunken driving. If you drive impaired, your driver’s license is revoked, and you can be imprisoned for up to three years. If you had passengers, they, too, will be prosecuted. As a result, the Japanese just don’t drink and drive. The law makes it so it just isn’t worth it. Why do we tolerate DUIs here?

But two southern state pollsters are bucking the trend — and they’ve got former President Donald Trump up big. The polling by InsiderAdvantage and Trafalgar in seven battleground states finds Trump on a path to 296 electoral votes — suggesting that Harris has already lost her momentum. Matt Towery of Georgia-based InsiderAdvantage found Trump ahead in Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina (and down by 0.4% only in Georgia). He noted that both he and Robert Calahy of Trafalgar (which handled Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan) were both in the top 3 of pollsters in the ‘16 and ‘20 cycles because their methodology allows them to “pick up some Trump vote that some of the other pollsters might not be able to get.” To be sure, all of Trump’s leads are narrow and within the margin of error — meaning the states could still very well go either way on Election Day. But, Towery believes Harris is stalling now that her novelty has worn off. “The momentum that we were seeing after the Democratic National Convention has sort of come to an end,” Towery said. And surges in Democratic enthusiasm seen in polls after Harris replaced Biden have also slowed, and are now “close to parity,” he said. The “turnout election” will be shaped heavily by next week’s “make or break” presidential debate, he believes. If Trump presents a “realistic” version of himself, “this could become a real turning point like the Carter-Reagan debate that basically sealed the deal” in 1980, Towery predicted. For his part, South Carolina-based Calahy agreed about the debate’s importance. He said that it’s possible that the former president may say something that “overshadows” the rest of the event — but that Harris has “the most to lose” and is in a “no-win situation.” Calahy sees “conservative Democrats” coming over to Trump’s side in numbers that exceed crossover for Harris, and also suggests that her disinterest in interviews has left the media feeling “ignored” and “angry.” But despite the polling looking good for Trump, Calahy cautions the “Democratic machine” can shave “a point or 2” off of the spread. Therefore, a narrow lead in September may not be the final outcome.","summary":"The polling in seven battleground states finds Trump on a path to 296 electoral votes — and suggests the momentum of the race has already shifted away from Harris.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/03/us-news/kamala-harris-has-already-lost-momentum-pollsters/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/88877613.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/G2IhRhLZ-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-03 22:57:34","author":"A.g.

Hamas isnÃ¢ÂÂt Ã¢ÂÂdesignated as a terrorist group in Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, or Turkey,Ã¢ÂÂ which Ã¢ÂÂgives the group quite a few banking and financial options.Ã¢ÂÂ And a bombshell from The Economist Ã¢ÂÂnoted last November that one of the key countries for financing HamasÃ¢ÂÂs operations is our NATO ally, Turkey,Ã¢ÂÂ whose Ã¢ÂÂbanking system helps Hamas dodge American sanctions by conducting complex transactions across the world.Ã¢ÂÂ HamasÃ¢ÂÂs $1 billion Ã¢ÂÂfinancial empire has been painstakingly crafted to avoid Western sanctions.Ã¢ÂÂ This makes it Ã¢ÂÂout of reach for Israel and its allies.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe chances that a President Kamala HarrisÃ¢ÂÂ would avoid Ã¢ÂÂarm-twisting social media companies into censorshipÃ¢ÂÂ are Ã¢ÂÂnot great,Ã¢ÂÂ laments The Free PressÃ¢ÂÂ Abigail Shrier. And Ã¢ÂÂthanks to a recent Supreme Court ruling,Ã¢ÂÂ thereÃ¢ÂÂd be Ã¢ÂÂlittle to stopÃ¢ÂÂ her. Even before the Jan. 6 riot, Harris demanded Twitter ban President Donald Trump: Social-media companies, she fumed, speak Ã¢ÂÂdirectlyÃ¢ÂÂ to Ã¢ÂÂmillions of people without any level of oversight or regulation, and that has to stop.Ã¢ÂÂ Now, notes Shrier, Harris has tapped Rob Flaherty, the Biden official who pressured Facebook to suppress Post reports on the COVID vaccine, as her deputy campaign manager. The problem? The court ruled only social-media companies, not users, can sue the government for censorship Ã¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂwhat company will take the riskÃ¢ÂÂ of government retaliation? Ã¢ÂÂA federal judge ruled that a lawsuit by Elon Musk against Media Matters can move forward in what could prove a significant case not just for the liberal outlet but the entire media industry,Ã¢ÂÂ reports Jonathan Turley at The Hill. The suit centers on a MM Ã¢ÂÂreport suggesting that advertisements of major corporations were being posted next to pro-Nazi posts or otherwise hateful content on the platformÃ¢ÂÂ; it accuses MM of Ã¢ÂÂmanipulating the algorithms to produce the pairing alleged.Ã¢ÂÂ Most media Ã¢ÂÂare overwhelmingly hostile towardÃ¢ÂÂ the suit because it Ã¢ÂÂdirectly challenges the ability of media outlets to create false narratives to advance a political agenda.Ã¢ÂÂ To claims that Ã¢ÂÂBrazilÃ¢ÂÂs banning and blocking of the social media platform X is far more extreme than anything being proposed in the United States,Ã¢ÂÂ Michael Shellenberger counters at X that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have Ã¢ÂÂboth repeatedly endorsed the three main censorship tactics used by the Brazilian government: censorship of election Ã¢ÂÂmisinformation,Ã¢ÂÂ de-platforming political opponents, and cross-platform bans.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂHis Twitter account should be shut down,Ã¢ÂÂ said Harris of then-President Donald Trump in 2019. Walz has claimed Ã¢ÂÂthat the First Amendment does not protect hate speech and misinformation.Ã¢ÂÂ While Ã¢ÂÂneither Harris nor Walz called for completely banning and blocking social media platforms,Ã¢ÂÂ Shellenberger notes, Ã¢ÂÂthe severity of their callsÃ¢ÂÂ for Ã¢ÂÂgovernment regulationÃ¢ÂÂ of social-media platforms comes all too close. Ã¢ÂÂIn California, New York, Pennsylvania, and Nevada, it is now possible to vote in person without any form of identification,Ã¢ÂÂ warns TabletÃ¢ÂÂs Armin Rosen. Even Ã¢ÂÂpoor and farawayÃ¢ÂÂ Somaliland Africa requires its citizens Ã¢ÂÂobtain an identification card from the electoral commission months in advance of the vote.Ã¢ÂÂ Unlike Somaliland, Ã¢ÂÂmost Americans no longer have to physically show up at a polling place to vote.Ã¢ÂÂ US voting systems allow the Ã¢ÂÂchoice of filling out and submitting their ballots beyond the observation of election officials,Ã¢ÂÂ which offers Ã¢ÂÂno assurance that the people in whose names ballots are cast actually signed Ã¢ÂÂ or saw Ã¢ÂÂ their ballots.Ã¢ÂÂ All of this is Ã¢ÂÂpractically calibrated to produce mistrust, and to create broad segments of public opinion that believe the whole thing is fake Ã¢ÂÂ regardless of who wins.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAccording to Jim Geraghty from the National Review, Hamas&#8217;s utilization of the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Investigating Hamas&#8217; complex financial network and Kamala&#8217;s potential for censorship: expert opinions. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/investigating-hamas-complex-financial-network-and-kamalas-potential-for-censorship-expert-opinions/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/HamasA¢AA-intricate-web-of-finances-Kamala-will-censor-and-other.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-03 22:54:05","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.111},{"id":255572934,"title":"WH Press Sec Shuts Down Fox Reporter’s ‘Insane’ Kamala Harris Question","text":"Karine Jean-Pierre refused to answer a question about Vice President Kamala Harris’ speaking voice Tuesday from Fox News’ White House correspondent, deriding the inquiry as “ridiculous.” At Tuesday’s daily press briefing, Peter Doocy, the cable network’s White House correspondent since 2021, asked Jean-Pierre: “Since when does the vice president have what sounds like a southern accent?” The press secretary immediately let the Fox reporter know: “I have no idea what you are talking about.” “She was talking about unions in Detroit using one tone of voice,” Doocy said. “She used the same line in Pittsburgh and it sounded like she at least had some kind of a southern drawl.” The uproar appears to have started after a post from the Trump campaign’s account on X, formerly Twitter, which posted side-by-side videos from the rallies in Detroit and Pittsburgh. “You better thank a union member for sick leave, you better thank a union member for paid leave, you better thank a union member for vacation time,” Harris yelled to applause while speaking before union workers at a Detroit high school. “Thank unions for sick leave, thank unions for paid family leave, thank unions for your vacation time,” Harris said in Pittsburgh—in a slightly less animated speech after traveling over 200 miles between the two cities. “Do you think Americans seriously think that this is an important question?” the incredulous press secretary asked Doocy. “I’m not even going to entertain some question about… it’s just, hearing it sounds so ridiculous.” “The question is just insane,” Jean-Pierre added. Doocy pressed on, asking Jean-Pierre “Is that how she talks in meetings here?” The press secretary immediately called on another reporter. Harris was raised in Berkeley, California and Montreal, Canada before attending Howard University in Washington, D.C.—one of the premier historically black colleges and universities in the country. Although she is not from the South, Black culture in the Bay Area was heavily influenced by the region. Over 3 million Black southerners left the region during the second phase of the Great Migration, according to the National Archives, and many ended up in the Bay Area. African American Vernacular English was first recognized as a separate language in the same region. The Oakland Unified School District approved AAVE as a second language in 1996, and scholars have since written extensively on the differences between it and standard American English. The well documented linguistic phenomenon of “code switching” might also explain the small differences in Harris’ accent. “Many of us subtly, reflexively change the way we express ourselves all the time,” wrote NPR’s Gene Demby in a blog post that launched the popular podcast “Code Switch,” which has run since 2013. “We’re hop-scotching between different cultural and linguistic spaces and different parts of our own identities—sometimes within a single interaction.” However, the phenomenon has stumped right-wingers for years, inducing outrage from former Fox host Tucker Carlson, who made similar comments about former President Barack Obama’s accent while he was still running for office in 2007. But it’s not the first time the Trump campaign has zeroed in on Harris’ accent, calling it out after her star-studded rally in Atlanta, which featured major Black artists including Quavo and Megan Thee Stallion.","summary":"Elizabeth Frantz/ReutersKarine Jean-Pierre refused to answer a question about Vice President Kamala Harris’ speaking voice Tuesday from Fox News’ White House correspondent, deriding the inquiry as “ridiculous.”\n\nAt Tuesday’s daily press briefing, Peter Doocy, the cable network’s White House correspondent since 2021, asked Jean-Pierre: “Since when does the vice president have what sounds like a southern accent?”\n\nThe press secretary immediately let the Fox reporter know: “I have no idea what you are talking about.”\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/wh-press-sec-karine-jean-pierre-shuts-down-fox-reporters-insane-kamala-harris-question","image":"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2085,w_3706,x_0,y_35/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1725403585/2024-09-03T203219Z_689471623_RC27T9AZRRKZ_RTRMADP_3_USA-BIDEN_y8ttbg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-03 22:49:31","author":"Zachary Folk","authors":["Zachary Folk"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.001},{"id":255572446,"title":"Some Gold Star families stand by Trump after Arlington incident","text":"Some Gold Star families stand by Trump after Arlington incident Some Gold Star families are defending former President Donald Trump amid the controversy over his visit to Arlington National Cemetery.

On Monday, Brazil’s Supreme Court upheld a judge’s ruling that shut down X for refusing to obey government censorship demands. The decision came days after France arrested Telegram CEO Pavel Durov, and Hong Kong convicted two journalists of sedition for publishing material critical of the government. And in November, American voters must decide if they want the government to limit what they can hear and read, censor the scientific information they can receive and restrict the political views they’re exposed to — because all that is part of how Kamala Harris defines “freedom.” Democrats are claiming that they’re the party of freedom, but Harris’ track record shows she’s the enemy of our most fundamental liberty: free speech. She has long sought to use government power to muzzle those who disagree with her. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s letter to the House Judiciary Committee last week should frighten every American who values free expression. Better late than never, Zuckerberg called it “wrong” that the Harris-Biden administration strong-armed Facebook to take down posts indicating masks don’t work and COVID vaccines might produce side effects. Zuckerberg said, “I regret we were not more outspoken about it.” Zuckerberg’s letter confirms evidence already presented to the US Supreme Court, as well as in congressional testimony, that the Harris-Biden administration repeatedly pressured social media companies to censor — getting them to do the dirty work the First Amendment prohibits government from doing directly. Three days after Zuckerberg’s letter made headlines, CNN’s Dana Bash interviewed Harris — and never asked about her role in censoring social media. That’s journalistic malpractice. Harris did tell Bash that “my values haven’t changed.” That’s for sure. Harris chose as her deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty, formerly the White House director of digital strategy — the person who called the shots about what got censored under President Biden. Flaherty was cited in federal court filings as meeting and corresponding with officials at Facebook, Twitter and other online platforms, demanding they act aggressively against posts spreading COVID-19 “misinformation.” Promoting Flaherty is a red flag that a Harris-Walz administration aims to snuff out your core freedoms. X owner Elon Musk isn’t mincing words about the threat Harris poses to free speech. “The attacks this year on free speech are unprecedented in the 21st century,” Musk posted Friday. “It will happen in America too if Kamala/Walz gain power.” His warning came shortly after Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes blocked X within his country, imposing steep fines on anyone there who tries to use the platform. The judge’s rationale will sound frighteningly familiar: He suspended X, he wrote, to protect democracy. In 2022, de Moraes was given sweeping powers to restrict and remove “disinformation” about the outcome of Brazil’s highly contested presidential election. Musk had repeatedly flouted Moraes’ censorship commands. The judge’s justification for shutting down X in Brazil mirrors Harris’ efforts to censor political opponents here. In 2019, as California’s attorney general, Harris lobbied then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to ban President Donald Trump from the platform. “How is that not a violation of free speech?” CNN’s Jake Tapper asked her, adding that such a move would result in “a slippery slope where they have to ban — you know, half the people on Twitter.” In reply, Harris doubled down, insisting that free online expression is a “privilege” and that censorship is necessary to defend “our democracy” from those who spread misinformation. That’s the vernacular of tyrants. And what about Harris’ deeds? As California AG in 2016, she tried to enforce a state law compelling pregnancy centers run by religious organizations to give their clients information offering state-funded abortions — in short, compelling these centers to advertise that which violated their beliefs. The law, which Harris defended in federal court, was ultimately defeated when the US Supreme Court ruled against it. In another unsuccessful end-run around the First Amendment, AG Harris tried to compel conservative nonprofits in California to release their donors’ names, an effort the Supreme Court ruled was an unconstitutional intimidation of donors that violated their First Amendment rights. Even the usually ultra-liberal American Civil Liberties Union opposed Harris’ demand. Harris has been an enemy of the First Amendment throughout her career. On August 18, as he suspended his campaign, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. discussed his “alarm” at Harris’ and Biden’s “resort to censorship, media control, and weaponization of the federal agencies“ — an ongoing assault that he called “an attack on our most sacred right of free expression.” Zuckerberg, Musk and Kennedy — unlikely bedfellows, to be sure.

Hamas isn’t “designated as a terrorist group in Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, or Turkey,” which “gives the group quite a few banking and financial options.” And a bombshell from The Economist “noted last November that one of the key countries for financing Hamas’s operations is our NATO ally, Turkey,” whose “banking system helps Hamas dodge American sanctions by conducting complex transactions across the world.” Hamas’s $1 billion “financial empire has been painstakingly crafted to avoid Western sanctions.” This makes it “out of reach for Israel and its allies.” Media watch: Kamala Will Censor “The chances that a President Kamala Harris” would avoid “arm-twisting social media companies into censorship” are “not great,” laments The Free Press’ Abigail Shrier. And “thanks to a recent Supreme Court ruling,” there’d be “little to stop” her. Even before the Jan. 6 riot, Harris demanded Twitter ban President Donald Trump: Social-media companies, she fumed, speak “directly” to “millions of people without any level of oversight or regulation, and that has to stop.” Now, notes Shrier, Harris has tapped Rob Flaherty, the Biden official who pressured Facebook to suppress Post reports on the COVID vaccine, as her deputy campaign manager. The problem? The court ruled only social-media companies, not users, can sue the government for censorship — and “what company will take the risk” of government retaliation? Legal take: Musk’s Media Matters Suit . . . Matters “A federal judge ruled that a lawsuit by Elon Musk against Media Matters can move forward in what could prove a significant case not just for the liberal outlet but the entire media industry,” reports Jonathan Turley at The Hill. The suit centers on a MM “report suggesting that advertisements of major corporations were being posted next to pro-Nazi posts or otherwise hateful content on the platform”; it accuses MM of “manipulating the algorithms to produce the pairing alleged.” Most media “are overwhelmingly hostile toward” the suit because it “directly challenges the ability of media outlets to create false narratives to advance a political agenda.” Iconoclast: Harris-Walz v. Free Speech To claims that “Brazil’s banning and blocking of the social media platform X is far more extreme than anything being proposed in the United States,” Michael Shellenberger counters at X that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have “both repeatedly endorsed the three main censorship tactics used by the Brazilian government: censorship of election ‘misinformation,’ de-platforming political opponents, and cross-platform bans.” “His Twitter account should be shut down,” said Harris of then-President Donald Trump in 2019. Walz has claimed “that the First Amendment does not protect hate speech and misinformation.” While “neither Harris nor Walz called for completely banning and blocking social media platforms,” Shellenberger notes, “the severity of their calls” for “government regulation” of social-media platforms comes all too close. Eye on elex: US Voting System Breeds Mistrust “In California, New York, Pennsylvania, and Nevada, it is now possible to vote in person without any form of identification,” warns Tablet’s Armin Rosen. Even “poor and faraway” Somaliland Africa requires its citizens “obtain an identification card from the electoral commission months in advance of the vote.” Unlike Somaliland, “most Americans no longer have to physically show up at a polling place to vote.” US voting systems allow the “choice of filling out and submitting their ballots beyond the observation of election officials,” which offers “no assurance that the people in whose names ballots are cast actually signed — or saw — their ballots.” All of this is “practically calibrated to produce mistrust, and to create broad segments of public opinion that believe the whole thing is fake — regardless of who wins.” — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"“Hamas’s global financial footprint and use of the regulated international financial system means that its facilitators likely have access to the US financial system,” thunders National Review’s Jim Geraghty.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/03/opinion/hamas-intricate-web-of-finances-kamala-will-censor-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-ip28imq2q-1725402032966.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1725387752&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-03 22:40:59","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.067},{"id":255571060,"title":"Arizona poised to pass border crackdown with ballot measure — but will it boost Trump?","text":"New polling from the Grand Canyon State shows a clear path for Proposition 314, a ballot measure that would allow police to do what the feds aren’t — clamp down on illegal immigration. According to the August survey of 1,000 registered voters from Noble Predictive Insights, the measure is on track to pass with a resounding 63% in favor, and just 16% opposed. An additional 22% say they either won’t vote on the measure or have yet to decide how they’ll cast their vote. The measure is popular across the political spectrum, reading as a clear rebuke of the Biden-Harris administration’s failed border enforcement policies: 77% of Republicans, 57% of independents, and 53% of Democrats are on board. Additionally, 58% of college grads back it, along with 56% of Hispanics and 52% of voters under 35. The measure’s popularity is driven by two components. First, criminal penalties for drug dealers who poison customers with deadly fentanyl, which 77% of respondents support. Second, the creation of an E-Verify system to check workers’ immigration status, which gets a thumbs up from 75% of those surveyed. “Prop 314 is popular across party lines, and that is a difficult trend to disrupt with only a couple of months until Election Day,” said Mike Noble, NPI’s founder and CEO. The ballot measure’s popularity measures against the backdrop of Democratic deficiency on border enforcement and the Republicans capitalizing on the vacuum. Last month, J.D. Vance was in Arizona, blaming the “Kamala Harris administration” for the porous border. Recent polling suggests Trump may take the state. RealClearPolitics shows Trump leading Harris in its average — 47.9% to 47.4% — in the race for Arizona’s 11 electoral votes. And don’t forget — a victory by less than half a percentage point would trigger an automatic recount in the state.

The Democratic presidential candidate is under intense pressure from progressives to get tough on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the war with Hamas drags on for nearly a year. Harris insists she's committed to Israel's defense. But as a peace deal continues to evade the war in Gaza, Harris has declined to answer questions on whether the U.S. could use its soft power in halting weapons shipments to a top ally in the Middle East to affect policy change under her leadership. Last week, Harris was pressed on whether she would do anything differently from President Joe Biden with Israel and the war in Gaza. She answered in the negative, but quickly pivoted to the need for a peace deal. The Harris campaign did not respond to a request from Fox News Digital on whether halting weapons shipments would be on or off the table if Harris takes the White House. \"President Biden has tried unsuccessfully to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. He’s been doing it for months and months, along with you. Would you do anything differently? For example, would you withhold some U.S. weapons shipments to Israel?\" CNN’s Dana Bash asked the vice president on Thursday. \"Let me be very clear. I’m unequivocal and — and unwavering in my commitment to Israel’s defense and its ability to defend itself,\" she said, before detailing the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks and noting \"too many Palestinian civilians have been killed.\" HARRIS TEAM MAY BE OPEN TO ‘NEW DIRECTION’ ON ISRAEL POLICY: REP RO KHANNA Some 42,000 Palestinians have died in the conflict since October, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. \"We have to get a deal done. This war must end,\" she went on. \"Let’s get the hostages out. Let’s get the ceasefire done.\" \"But no change in policy in terms of arms and — and so forth?\" Bash pressed again. \"No. We have to get a deal done. Dana, we have to get a deal done. When you look at the significance of this to the families, to the people who are living in that region — a deal is not only the right thing to do to end this war but will unlock so much of what must happen next.\" \"I remain committed, since I’ve been on Oct. 8, to what we must do to work toward a two-state solution where Israel is secure and in equal measure the Palestinians have security and self-determination — and dignity.\" Israel said last week the U.S. had shipped more than 50,000 tons of arms and military equipment since war broke out in October. Congress passed a bill that included $26 billion in arms assistance for Israel and aid for Gaza in April. The United Kingdom on Monday paused dozens of weapons exports to Israel over concerns those arms could be used to violate international law. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy told lawmakers on Monday that the decision related to about 30 of 350 export licenses for equipment that includes parts for military aircraft and drones and items used for ground targeting. Lammy said the British government believes the equipment \"is for use in the current conflict in Gaza\" and represents a \"clear risk\" that some could be used to \"commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law.\" Back home, Netanyahu is under attack from all sides after it was revealed that six Israeli hostages were found dead in a Hamas tunnel. Protesters took to the streets to demand a hostage deal over the weekend. Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a 23-year-old Israeli-American whose parents made an emotional plea for a hostage deal at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) last month, was among the dead. President Joe Biden replied \"no\" over the weekend when asked if Netanyahu is doing enough to secure the hostages. Over the weekend, Biden and Harris worked on a hostage deal with their negotiating team as the news of the additional deaths broke. The president said \"we’re very close\" to securing a hostage deal that all sides could agree to, though such a deal has evaded negotiators for months. \"Hope springs eternal,\" he said.","summary":"After the United Kingdom paused some arms shipments to Israel on Monday, it’s not entirely clear whether Vice President Kamala Harris could follow the same path.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-unclear-whether-she-could-stop-weapons-shipments-israel","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/09/931/523/GettyImages-2169353481.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-03 22:31:11","author":"Morgan Phillips","authors":["Morgan Phillips"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.112},{"id":255571328,"title":"Indian Industry Ready to Adjust To Any Regime in USA after November Prez Polls","text":"By Subrata Majumder Come November 5, global futurists are scrambling to anticipate how a second term of Trump’s Presidency bode for the world and India. According to the latest opinion poll by New York Times, Kamala Harris has marginal edge over Trump. But, it does not foretell the demise of Trump chances for second term. Indian industry people are closely monitoring the poll speeches of the two Presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and trying to assess their relevance to the India-US business relations. Indian business people have felt with both first term of Trump and the present term of the Democratic President Joe Biden. They have not found much difference in the trade and business relationship. But some of the industry leaders feel that Trump’s economic policies may be helpful to India in expanding its domestic market and exports. Kamala Harris, though half Indian by heritage, does not augur well for special priority on USA-India relations, they feel. Reality lies with the background during Biden administration, when strengthening of US-India relation was geared by Presidential initiative, rather than vice president Harris’s Indian heritage. For this section of industry, it is a mix of concern and comforts. If Trump comes back to power. Trump’s emphatic focus on protectionism is a matter of concern. At the same time Trump’s hard stand against China bodes well for India s India will be far more competitive against China in the export market as the Chinese products will be higher priced as a result of US measures against China. Donald Trump said he will impose 10 percent import tariff on all nations and 60 percent on China. His America First will get a push to instill confidence of Americanization in every policy where “Every decision on trade, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families”, which was outlined during Trump’s first term. How will India shift gear on the line of USA’s “America First” Policy? Past experiences show a different template. Despite India losing Special Status (GSP scheme) in USA trade policy during Trump’s first term (2017-21) and USA harping on non-reciprocal entry, USA continued to be one of the biggest entry of Indian products. It became three times biggest trading partner, with India exporting and importing less. India exports mainly four products to USA. They were diamonds and jewellery, apparels and textile, oil refinery products and pharmaceuticals. If Trump imposes 10 percent import tariff, imports of these 4 products groups should be affected. But, the reality lies somewhere else. The biggest export item by India to USA is diamond and jewellery. Apparently, import tariff should impact India’s export of diamond and jewellery. But, there is a catch. India has an edge over its competitors, such as Israel and Belgium. India is the largest cutting and polishing centre of rough diamond in the world. US bridals prefer for customize design of India. Similarly, Indian pharmaceutical industry play an important role in US market. According to a report, Indian companies account for about 47 percent of generic prescriptions filed in USA by 2022.The core issue of trade partnership with USA is that India continued to be the surplus trade partner, despite Trump’s protectionist policy. Notwithstanding these contentious issues, India’s exports to USA spurred during the Trump period. In other words, India’s export to USA remained resilient despite Trump’s withdrawing of Special status to India. During 2017-18 to 2020-21, India’s export to USA jumped by over 59 percent. Its surplus trade balance widened further from US$21.3 billion in 2017-18 to US$ 22.8 billion in 2020-21. Indo-Pacific region will emerge an important pivot in Trump’s second term, which will showcase a turning point of Trump led USA –India relation. USA will play key role in the newly formed IPEF (Indo Pacific Economic Forum). In this new dynamics, where India will also sit in the driver seat, USA-India relation will witness a different template, according to these industry people. India will have to brace for two challenges with new Trump’s America .First, trade and second immigration. Given India’s protracted surplus trade with USA, it is obvious Trump administration will press hard on balancing trade surplus with India. Trump’s administration will press for stringent non-reciprocal entry in USA. This means Trump will enforce India to import more from USA to counter balance the surplus.. Currently, major items of imports from USA are oil refinery goods and edible products like nuts. Another important issue will be restriction on immigration. During the first term, Trump administration blocked visas for wide variety of jobs for non-Americans, including those for computer programming and other skilled workers under HI-B visa. Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump immigration policy has restricted the immigration, arguing that they harm employment prospect of Americans. India is the biggest beneficiary of HI B visa .Annually, more than 70 percent of HI B visa is issued to Indian applicants. Trump administration will surely lay down restriction on India’s IT professionals entry in USA to protect the Americans for jobs. Another issue, which attracts attention against Trump’s conservative policy is that during his first term US investment in India boomed. It increased five times in India – from US$ 2.1 billion in 2017-18 to US$ 10.5 billion in 2021-22. This demonstrates Trump‘s wide outlook to promote American investment in India in big Indian market and a far reaching bigger role in Indo-Pacific region. Given these, Trump’s returning back in power does not bode ill to India. With upcoming of IPEF (Indo Pacific Economic Forum ), which let USA to play Big Brother role to counterbalance China and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking the driver seat, Trump’s administration is likely to be more moderate than before, these sources feel. Experts on India-US relations say that the trade and investment relations do not depend solely on official policies, the personal relationship also plays a role. Narendra Modi had established a personal rapport with Donald Trump during his tenure due to the commonality of conservatism. But Kamala Harris is different. She is a human rights lawyer, a bit leftwing and quite opposed to the agenda of Hindutva pursued in India and also in USA by Narendra Modi’s party. The Hindu groups in US were closer to Trump in his first term. The same will not be happening if Kamala comes to power. So the Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have to establish a fresh equation with Kamala if she comes to power. It is not difficult in view of her deep Indian connections.. Our PM is expert in cultivating ties and making new friends. If that happens, it will be far easier for the Indian industry to emerge stronger in the coming years by getting larger US direct investment and technology and also expanding the export market. In any case, Indian industry is resilient enough to adjust with any regime in USA.

Trump said he agrees with the legalization of medical cannabis but suggested he doesn’t like recreational weed. Fridman told Trump that he recently did ayahuasca and said the spiritual benefits could help members of Congress if they used it. Trump just seemed very confused during that portion of the interview. Trump said “I guess I’d do it, but I haven’t been asked and I’m not asking them” about the Joe Rogan podcast. Trump acknowledged his “reposts” on Truth Social can get him in trouble, without recognizing that his normal posts are just as fascist and unhinged. “I call it my typewriter,” Trump said of his Truth Social posts. Trump also denied calling dead soldiers “suckers and losers.” Trump spewed many lies about Kamala Harris, including conspiracy theories about her being a secret Communist. Trump said he needs to “fight fire with fire” when people are attacking him. Trump repeatedly praised authoritarian figures, including Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orban.

The 2024 election has the potential to garner one of the biggest gender divides in history, according to preliminary polling—while Trump was found to be leading Vice President Kamala Harris by 14 points among male voters in the Times/Siena College poll, and Harris was shown ahead among women voters by 21 points.At the start of last month, Trump sat down with 23-year-old Adin Ross, a well-known live-streamer on the platform Kick and popular among conservatives. He also sat for an interview with influencer Logan Paul in June, who has over 23.6 million subscribers on YouTube, and spoke with X owner and billionaire Elon Musk in a livestreamed interview last month, which Trump claimed reached 1 billion people.

Jared Polis told ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday. \"Most voters recognize that as you get more information, as you get more experience, perhaps as you hold a different job… that there would be a natural evolution,\" echoed Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Penn., during a Labor Day appearance on CNN. Meanwhile, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., took a different approach when he appeared on NBC's \"Meet The Press\" over the weekend, describing her as a \"progressive who [is] pragmatic\" and one who is \"consistent\" in her policy approach. BILL MAHER MOCKS FLIP FLOPS FROM HARRIS AND WALZ IN CNN INTERVIEW: ‘JUST INSULTING MY INTELLIGENCE’ During her first interview as the Democratic nominee on Thursday, Harris insisted she would \"enforce\" the law against illegal border crossings, something Harris indicated she was against while running her 2019 campaign to become president. ‘FOR ELECTION PURPOSES’: CRITICS BALK AT HARRIS' CLAIM SHE WILL ‘ENFORCE OUR LAWS' AT SOUTHERN BORDER Harris also argued that she made it clear as the vice presidential nominee in 2020 that she does not wish to ban fracking, despite indicating as a presidential nominee in 2019 that she was \"in favor of banning fracking\" on federal land. \"This idea that she hasn't been consistent — I mean what about Donald Trump's flip-flops? What about his flip-flops on abortion?\" Khanna questioned Sunday. \"I think the vice president is consistent on the position on fracking. It's exactly how Joe Biden ran.\" On healthcare, campaign officials have said Harris does not support Medicare for All. However, Harris has yet to share publicly that she is not in favor of a single-payer health care system after indicating during a 2019 debate that she would \"abolish\" private healthcare in favor of a \"government-run plan.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for clarity on Harris' position when it comes to healthcare, but did not receive a response. \"I ran against her as a co-chair of Bernie Sanders' campaign — she was not for Medicare for All in that 2020 primary,\" Khanna said.

It May Not Be Enough.","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris is winning support from an overwhelming number of Black Americans, but that still may not be enough to defeat former President Donald Trump in key swing states in November.Black voters are a key group of Harris' coalition, as they have backed Democrats by massive margins in past presidential elections, despite the small but significant GOP inroads made in 2020.Republicans are optimistic they can continue gaining ground among Black voters, as some polls suggest Harris is falling behind past Democratic candidates like former President Barack Obama or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Some polls even show her numbers among Black voters running behind President Joe Biden's 2020 polling.Whether or not Harris, who is Black, can win big margins among Black Democrats could make the difference in key swing states Pennsylvania and Georgia, two of the states most likely to determine the outcome of the election.A Suffolk University poll released on Tuesday showed that Harris' polling numbers among Black voters are weaker than previous Democratic nominees, including Biden. The difference may not appear drastic, but could matter in states that could be decided by only a few thousand votes.The poll, which surveyed 1,000 likely voters from August 25 to 28, showed Harris leading Trump by 64 points among Black voters (76% to 12%). It found Harris leading Trump among all voters by just over 4 points (47.6 to 43.3%).A similar poll released on Labor Day four years ago showed Biden with a 78% lead among Black voters (82 percent to 4 percent). It surveyed 1,000 registered voters from August 28 to August 31, 2020.Meanwhile, a Suffolk poll released just after Labor Day 2016 showed Clinton with an 88-point lead among Black voters (92% to four percent). The same poll from August 2012 showed Obama with a 71-point lead among Black voters (77% to 6%).David Paleologos, the director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, told Newsweek on Tuesday that Harris likely needs to win Black voters by a net of 85 percentage points over Trump, or she could be in danger of losing key states.Harris had made \"great strides\" but is still \"falling short of where she needs to be,\" he said, pointing to a drop in Democratic support among Black men between the ages of 18 and 34.\"Harris could still win Wisconsin without the exact same support levels of black voters if she improves her standing in the suburban and rural areas of the Badger state,\" he said.Michigan and Pennsylvania will be critical, too. \"Both of those states rely on big margins (13-1) coming out of Detroit and Philadelphia to offset most of the red counties in the rest of those states. If she only wins the black communities 8-1, it will be very challenging,\" Paleologos said.Andrea Benjamin, a professor at the University of Oklahoma, told Newsweek that neither candidate should take Black voters for granted, and that Harris should emphasize issues that matter most to Black voters, such as the cost of housing, reproductive rights and voting rights. These are issues she noted that most middle and working class Americans, regardless of their race, may find common ground.Current polls may not necessarily be indicative of how Black voters will vote in November, she said. Previous Democratic presidential candidates had more time to build trust among the electorate, and that many voters may have felt \"more confident in what they were doing\" further out from the election, she said.Candidates should also work with community leaders to build trust among Black voters in key states, having a \"state level plan,\" rather than bring in people who are not connected to local communities to try to get out the vote. Voters respect \"authentic outreach,\" she said.\"Relying on networks that are already active and have the community respect. To me that's the place I would start, because if a random person knocks on my door and tells me I have to vote, I can sort of take it or leave it. But when it's someone that I know from my community, I might be a little more receptive,\" she said.Harris Has Reversed 'Bleak' Polling: Dem StrategistMatt McDermott, a Democratic strategist who serves as the senior vice president of Whitman Insight Strategies, believesHarris will be able to match past Democrats' performance among Black voters, noting that the number of Black voters considering Trump continues to fall.\"Polling earlier this year was bleak: showing Biden losing up to 35% of Black voters to either third party candidates like RFK Jr. or to the Republican nominee Donald Trump. Since Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee, polls are now finding fewer than 20% of Black voters would consider a candidate other than the Democratic nominee, with that figure steadily falling,\" he said.However, he said what is \"more important\" than her margin is that Black voters have become more engaged and likely to vote since she became a candidate, and her polling gains have with them have made the race more competitive in states with a high percentage of Black voters.\"Kamala Harris' entrance into this race has fundamentally upended the electoral map and put states like Georgia and North Carolina into battleground status. Harris has opened up multiple pathways to 270 thanks to her support among Black voters,\" he said.Both Harris and Trump are making plays to increase their share of the Black vote. Harris, who would become the first Black and Asian woman elected president if elected, has has emphasized her economic policies, such as an aggressive housing plan, over her identity. Even without a laser focus on identity, her candidacy has seen Black voters come back around to the party after surveys earlier this year found Biden losing support.Meanwhile, Trump last month spoke at a National Association of Black Journalists panel, where he was interviewed by several Black journalists. The appearance sparked immediate and widespread criticism after he questioned Harris' racial identity, saying during that panel that she \"happened to turn Black.\"Conservatives have sought to win over Black voters by highlighting her stance on immigration, as polls suggest the issue may be her biggest weakness among various racial groups. Republicans have specifically sough to win over Black men, a key voting bloc polls suggest have trended toward the GOP.To that point, NBC News reported last month that conservative groups are highlighting the Biden administration's efforts to ban menthol cigarettes, which government data shows is more likely to be used by Black smokers, in key states in an effort to dull their support for Harris. The Biden administration meanwhile punted the menthol ban until after the election, seeing its potential problem with Black voters.Newsweek reached out to the Harris campaign for comment via email.Comparison to Past RacesA recent YouGov poll delivered better numbers for Harris among black voters. The survey, conducted among 1,368 registered voters from August 25 to August 27, showed Harris with a 69-point lead over Trump among Black voters (81% to 12%).This marks an improvement from where their poll showed Biden polling among Black voters four years prior, as an August 27 to August 28, 2020 showed Biden with only a 64-point lead over Trump among Black voters (7% to 11%).Still, it found Harris polling behind where Clinton or Obama were among Black voters around this time in the cycle.An August 2016 YouGov poll showed Clinton with a 76-point lead over Trump among Black voters (82% to 6%), while an August 2008 poll showed Obama with an 82-point lead (85% to 3%).Elsewhere, a Quinnipiac University poll, conducted among 1,611 likely voters from August 23 to August 27, found Harris with a 55-point lead among Black voters (75% to 20%).A poll four years earlier, conducted among 1,081 likely voters from August 28 to August 31, 2020, found Biden with a 58-point lead (74% to 16%).While some polls suggest Harris may still have work to do to improve her margins among Black voters, an earlier Suffolk poll showed that she reversed most of the gains Trump made among Black voters.Suffolk polled Black voters in Michigan and Pennsylvania, two key swing states both before and after Biden exited the race in July. The polls found that Harris gained ground on Biden, whose polling among Black voters had dropped.One survey polled 500 respondents per state between June 9 and June 13, finding Biden with a 39-point lead in Michigan (54.4% to 13.8%) and a 45-point lead in Pennsylvania (56.2% to 10.8%).However, an August poll of Black voters from the two states showed Harris leading by 62 points in Michigan (70.4% to 8.6%) and about 60 points in Pennsylvania (70.4% to 10.8%).In 2020, Biden won 87% of Black voters, while Trump won 12%, according to the New York Times' exit poll. In 2016, Clinton won 88%, while Trump won 8% of Black voters. Obama won 93% of Black Americans, compared to Mitt Romney's 6%.Obama's 2008 election remains the strongest performance for a recent Democratic presidential candidate among Black voters, perhaps unsurprising given the historic nature of that race. Sixteen years ago, Obama won 95% of Black voters, compared to the 4% who backed John McCain.","summary":"Harris reversed most of Trump's gains among Black Americans, but still may be \"falling short\" of what she needs to win key states.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-black-voter-lead-donald-trump-1948176","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2463473/kamala-harris-polls-among-black-voters.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-03 22:19:08","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.213},{"id":255570252,"title":"White House falsely claims grocery prices have ‘come down’ under Biden — while Harris revives price-gouging claim","text":"WASHINGTON — President Biden’s chief spokesperson falsely said Tuesday that grocery prices have “come down” recently — when federal data show they cost 21.1% more than when Biden took office in 2021, including a persistent 1.1.% bump over the past year. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre made the unfactual claim when asked by a reporter if Biden agrees with Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign-trail argument that “price-gouging continues” with groceries. “Yes, we’ve talked about this,” Jean-Pierre said at her regular briefing. Then she added, “To be clear, we’ve seen grocery prices come down over the past year or more, and so that is important, and a lot of that has been the work that’s been done by this administration.” Labor Department data show that grocery prices have not come down, even though they are increasing less dramatically during Biden’s final year in office. Jean-Pierre drew viral mockery for her error, with the account RNC research tweeting, “Karine Jean-Pierre continues to show why she is the least competent press secretary in history.” Harris, 59, revived her focus on the alleged corporate greed driving grocery-store price hikes with an ad released Tuesday in which a narrator says the Democratic presidential candidate will “make groceries more affordable by cracking down on price-gouging.” The vice president last month announced plans for price controls on groceries — but has rarely mentioned the plan since, after withering bipartisan criticism, including from the Washington Post editorial board, which generally backs Democrats, and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump, 78, has cited Harris’ grocery price controls to depict her as a “communist” — referring to her as “Comrade Kamala” and insisting that she’s pushing the “Maduro plan,” referring to the economic collapse in Venezuela under the country’s socialist strongman, Nicolas Maduro. The food industry has disputed Harris’ attribution of blame, arguing that groceries are more expensive because overall inflation has caused labor and energy prices to increase. “We understand why there is this sticker shock and why it’s upsetting. But to automatically just say there’s got to be something nefarious, I think to us that is oversimplified,” Andy Harig, a vice president at FMI, a trade group representing food retailers and suppliers, told the Wall Street Journal. Trump has campaigned on inflation under Biden, including grocery prices — saying last month that “people are voting with their stomachs, meaning they’re going to the grocery store, they are paying 50, 60, 70% more for food than they did just a couple of years ago.” The White House did not immediately offer further comment.","summary":"President Biden's chief spokesperson falsely said Tuesday that grocery prices have \"come down\" recently — when federal data show they cost 21.1% more than when Biden took office in 2021, including a persistent 1.1.% bump over the past year.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/03/us-news/white-house-falsely-claims-grocery-prices-have-come-down-under-biden/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/88874298.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/LgvdrHpl-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-03 22:15:58","author":"Steven Nelson","authors":["Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.174},{"id":255572240,"title":"White House Press Secretary Shuts Down Fox News Reporter Over ‘Insane’ Question About Kamala Harris’ ‘Betta’ Accent","text":"White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre shut down Fox News’ Peter Doocy when he asked about Kamala Harris’ accent, a question she called “insane.” As Harris has been campaigning ahead of the 2024 election, some in conservative media have drawn attention to what they claim are different speaking voices.

The Jon Watts film, which follows two stubborn professional fixers who find themselves forced to work together after being hired for the same job, premiered at Venice Film Festival over the weekend. During a press conference at the event, Clooney took issue with “an interesting article” by The New York Times that reported he and Pitt were each paid more than $35m for the movie. “Whatever her source was for our salary, it is millions and millions and millions of dollars less than what was reported,” Clooney claimed. “And I am only saying that because I think it’s bad for our industry if that’s what people think is the standard bearer for salaries. I think that’s terrible, it’ll make it impossible to make films.” Wolfs will have a limited theatrical release on September 20, followed by its streaming debut on Apple TV+ on September 27. Elsewhere during the press conference, Clooney commented on the streamer’s decision to give the film just a week in theaters. “Yes, we wanted it to be released [in theaters],” he said. “We’ve had some bumps along the way, that happens. When I did The Boys in the Boat, we did it for MGM, and then it ended up being for Amazon and we didn’t get a foreign release at all, which was a surprise,” Clooney added. “There are elements of this that we are figuring out. You guys are all in this too. We’re all in this industry and we’re trying to find our way post-COVID and everything else, and so there’s some bumps along the way.” The Ocean’s Eleven star was also asked about the impact of the damning op-ed he wrote for The New York Times in July titled: “I Love Joe Biden, But We Need a New Nominee.” The essay was seen as one of the key turning points as momentum built to urge the president to step aside in favor of a younger candidate. Less than two weeks later, Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris – who was also quickly endorsed by Clooney. “The person who should be applauded is the president who did the most selfless thing that anybody has done since George Washington,” Clooney told journalists. “All of the machinations that got us there, none of that’s going to be remembered, and it shouldn’t be,” he continued. “What should be remembered is the selfless act of someone who did the hardest thing to do. You know we’ve seen it all around the world, and for someone to say, ‘I think there’s a better way forward,’ he gets all the credit, and that’s really the truth.” Wolfs is out in theaters on September 20 and will be released on Apple TV+ on September 27.","summary":"Actor said it was ‘bad for our industry if that’s what people think is the standard bearer for salaries’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/george-clooney-wolfs-salary-brad-pitt-b2606523.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/03/22/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/SaV3ZFc1-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-03 22:11:02","author":"Tom Murray","authors":["Tom Murray"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.345},{"id":255570030,"title":"Kamala Harris Could Land Key Group of Voters, Polls Show","text":"Voters over 65 haven't preferred the Democrat in a presidential election since 2000, when Al Gore lost to Republican George W. Bush. However, recent polls show that the coveted voter group is firmly in play for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in her race to the White House against Republican Donald Trump.According to the most recent New York Times/Siena Poll on August 10, Harris is polling at 55 percent compared to Trump's 42 percent among voters age 65 and up. That advantage only slightly dips for Harris, 53-41, with third-party candidates included in the poll.Sixty-seven percent of the 65-plus voters in the poll say they are \"almost certain\" to vote. In the last presidential election, roughly 52 percent of voters over 65 backed Trump.In addition, a survey released by Emerson College this month revealed that the majority of voters over 70 are supporting Harris over Trump, 51 percent to 48 percent.These results represent a major breakthrough for Harris, who has been able to surpass Trump's lead with older voters. Just last month, with President Joe Biden still in the race, 50 percent of voters over 70 supported Trump, while 48 percent of the age group backed Biden.Newsweek reached out to the Trump and Harris campaigns via email for comment.The over-70 category includes baby boomers, those born between 1946 and 1964, and the Silent Generation, anyone born between 1925 and 1945.In 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 19 percentage points among the Silent Generation. Trump won the same group by 16 percentage points over Biden in 2020.The senior voting bloc will be especially important to watch in key swing states like Pennsylvania and Arizona; 19 percent of Pennsylvania voters are 65 and up, and 18.5 percent of Arizona voters represent that crucial voting bloc.As the campaigns shift into high gear, both battleground states have razor-thin overall polling averages.According to 538's polling average, the vice president is 1.2 points ahead of Trump in Pennsylvania, 46.2 percent to his 45 percent. RealClearPolitics' polling average also puts Harris ahead, though by a margin of just 0.3 points.In Arizona, current polling shows the two candidates separated by mere percentage points. According to 538, Harris leads 45.7 percent to 45.4 percent, while RealClearPolitics has Trump leading by 47.9 percent to 47.4.Elderly individuals are the primary beneficiaries of well-received federal entitlements, including Social Security and Medicare, and they are usually the most conscious of possible amendments to these programs.Social Security and Medicare immediately impact the financial circumstances of senior voters, which encourages them to vote if they anticipate that selecting one political faction over another could lead to reductions. Thus, older voters frequently view the government as a considerable influence in their lives.Trump has recently proposed a tax cut to end all taxes on Social Security retirement income.\"SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!\" Trump wrote on July 31 on Truth Social, appealing to the tens of millions receiving monthly Social Security benefits ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Some 40 percent of benefit recipients currently pay federal income taxes on retirement, spousal and disability benefits—not including Supplemental Security Income (SSI).Under current Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules, individuals who have an income between $25,000 and $34,000 per year are subject to taxes on up to 50 percent of their Social Security income. If you earn more than this, as much as 85 percent of benefits provided by the Social Security Administration (SSA) could be taxed.However, experts have criticized Trump's plans, both from a cost and political perspective, warning that they could further imperil the SSA's imminent funding crisis and increase the national deficit.During her interview on CNN last week, Harris was asked whether she believes \"Bideneconomics\" is a success, a reference to how the Biden administration has tackled a number of issues ranging from inflation to health care.Harris said that she is \"very proud\" of the Biden administration's work \"to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors,\" adding, \"Donald Trump said he was going to do a number of things, including allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Never happened. We did it.\"\"I maintain that when we do the work of bringing down prescription medication for the American people, including capping the cost of the annual cost of prescription medication for seniors at $2,000...I'll say that that's good work,\" Harris added.","summary":"Recent polls show that a coveted voter group is firmly in play for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-polls-election-senior-vote-1948282","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2463579/harris-pennsylvania.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-03 22:10:54","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.083},{"id":255571282,"title":"Why some Republicans think Amazon Alexa is a ‘politically biased hack’","text":"Alexa is a smart speaker device used by 71 million people.

Vice President Kamala Harris will announce Wednesday that she plans to increase the amount in tax deductions offered for startups by tenfold if elected president — a policy experts say could cost Americans as much as $20 billion over the next decade. The Harris plan, expected to be unveiled during a campaign stop in New Hampshire, would up the current $5,000 tax deduction for small businesses and their startup expenses to $50,000. “This proposal would also allow new businesses to wait to claim that deduction until they first turn a profit in order to reduce their taxes,” a Harris campaign official said Tuesday. Garrett Watson, a senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, told The Post that the plan would cost approximately $20 billion over the next 10 years. The assessment was based in part on a provision from a 2010 federal law, the Small Business Job Creation Act, which upped the deduction of business expenditures for startups from $5,000 to $10,000, amounting to a total cost of $230 million over a decade. However, the increased deduction sunset after one year and was not extended. “Generally speaking, it’s better to allow startups the space to properly deduct costs from their revenue, including against future revenue, rather than disallowing deductions for expenses or requiring lengthy amortization of those costs,” Watson said. Marc Goldwein, a senior policy director for the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), affirmed the $20 billion ballpark cost. “Most of what this policy is doing is changing the timing of taxes,” Goldwein explained. “Normally it’s a benefit to deduct it faster, but startup costs are sometimes different.” The plan would benefit some business, Goldwein noted, but “as a practical matter, a lot of businesses are not going to be able to deduct that much in the first year.” “I’m glad to see Harris acknowledge that cutting taxes helps businesses,” added Adam Michel, the director of the libertarian Cato Institute’s tax policy studies. “The opposite is also true: raising taxes hurts businesses, big and small.” “Instead of limiting the deductibility of small business start-up expenses to just $50,000, a better policy would be to allow all businesses to deduct all of their expenses in the year they are made,” Michel offered. “This, often called full expensing, is one of the most pro-growth tax reforms, and was a centerpiece of former President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. “Unfortunately, the Harris proposal excludes most business investments,” Michel added. “By choosing to focus on a narrow segment of American employers, her proposals will make it harder for every other business in America to start up or expand their operations.” Michael also warned that the Democratic nominee’s economic policy would hurt, not help, American business. “As a whole, the Harris tax plan will raise taxes on small and family businesses by letting top individual tax rates return to 39.6%,” he said, “and will increase other business and investment taxes to some of the highest tax rates in the developed world.” “If Harris actually wanted to help American businesses grow, she should focus on allowing all businesses to deduct the costs of their investments and cut their tax rates rather than raising them,” Michel also said. The veep previously vowed to push for a corporate tax rate of 28%, up from the current rate of 21%. Harris, 59, also hopes to receive 25 million new business applications in her first term as president, the campaign official said. “There is no shortage of new business applications today, so it’s unclear why Harris would make that a priority,” said EJ Antoni, a public-finance economist at the Heritage Foundation. “Instead, the problem today is that most businesses can’t get started or fail shortly after starting due to high costs from inflation and regulatory burdens.” Antoni called the Harris proposal “a classic case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing.” “Harris wants to impose an unrealized gains tax, higher income taxes, and higher taxes on investment. If she wanted to reduce taxes on small businesses, she wouldn’t be pushing for more taxes instead,” he said. The small business agenda is one of the few detailed policy items that Harris has offered since taking over Democratic standard from President Biden, and comes off the heels of her other economic policy proposal that included a ban on purported price gouging of groceries, an increase in the Child Tax Credit and offering new homeowners $25,000 for a down payment — all policies that experts warned would increase inflation.","summary":"Small businesses, big price tag.

What Could That Mean for Kamala Harris?","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign is going all in on the \"brat\" and \"coconut\" memes they believe will help them win over some of the 41 million members of Gen Z who will be eligible to vote in November.Her opponent, former President Donald Trump's campaign has also been courting young voters in its own way, narrowly tailoring its online presence to a particular subset of young Americans: the Gen Z men who could become the swing cohort of this year's presidential election.It's the same demographic that has boosted far-right parties across the globe. In Argentina, Gen Z men helped the eccentric libertarian Javier Milei topple the country's two main political forces in 2021. In South Korea—where the ideological divide between young men and women has grown wider than anywhere else on Earth—young men overwhelmingly backed conservative candidate Yoon Suk Yeol, catapulting him to the presidency in 2022. On Sunday, young men in Germany delivered the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party the far right's best result since the Nazi era.The rise of right-wing youth politics has also been observed in China, the UK, France, Portugal, Tunisia, Belgium and Finland. And in America, it has piqued the interest of the most influential Republican.Over the last few months, Trump has turned his attention to young male voters, appearing on Theo Von and Lex Fridman's podcasts, livestreaming with Adin Ross, making TikToks with Logan and Jake Paul and putting his 18-year-old Gen Z son Barron and his best friend Bo Loudon at the helm of his social media outreach team.On Tuesday, Trump signaled he'd be open to an interview on the Joe Rogan Experience, the most-listened-to podcast in the U.S. with an estimated 11 million listeners per episode. Some bookmakers are now even taking bets on whether Trump will make an appearance on Rogan.\"It's a smart political strategy by the Trump campaign—to try to meet young men where they are,\" Melissa Deckman, CEO of the nonpartisan research firm PRRI and the author of \"The Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape Our Democracy,\" told Newsweek. \"They're more likely to watch Joe Rogan or Logan Paul or hang out at mixed martial arts events.\"The winning candidate \"is going to be the person that meets Gen Z where they are,\" Mason Morgan, the executive director of Run Gen Z, a group that recruits young conservatives for local and state office, told Newsweek.Recent polls show that Gen Z is far more conservative than some might think, given the history of young Americans skewing liberal. A SurveyUSA poll conducted earlier this month showed Trump leading Harris among Gen Z voters by four percentage points, with 50 percent of voters aged 18 to 34 backing the former president and 46 percent supporting the vice president.Data from Gallup and the Walton Family Foundation also found that Gen Z teens are twice as likely to identify as more conservative than their parents than millennials were 20 years ago. Even though the cohort of teens who feel this way remains relatively small —14% —it suggests a generational shift. When comparing their views to their parents, only seven percent of millennials said their views were \"more conservative\" two decades ago.But it's not a broad group of Gen Z teens driving that jump.\"It's typically reflective of a gender split, where it's mostly young men who are becoming more conservative and mostly young women who are not,\" Zach Hrynowski, the primary researcher of the Gen Z panel and Gallup's senior education consultant, told Newsweek.\"This year's election is going to be one of the biggest gender splits,\" he said.The divide between young men and women has widening over the years. In the 2022 midterms, a year in which voter turnout was expected to be low, 72% of women aged 18 to 29 voted for Democrats in House races, compared to about 54% of their male counterparts.\"Gen Z women have become far more liberal than older American women, but also their male counterparts,\" Deckman said. \"This is a generation of women who are far more likely to identify as feminist than, certainly, younger men, but also older women. And they are a generation of young voters who have become a huge constituency for the Democratic Party.\"At the same time, \"young men, around the world, are feeling a loss of status because women have been doing so well, comparatively, in a lot of ways,\" she said.\"Young men don't feel they can be included in Kamala Harris' 'new path forward,'\" Benjamin Geller, a former New York Republican legislator and political media strategist, told Newsweek.\"President Trump gives young men of all backgrounds an opportunity to achieve anything they've ever set their minds to and feel included at the same time.\"Four national New York Times/Siena College polls conducted between December and June, when President Joe Biden was still the presumptive Democratic nominee, showed a 39-point gender gap between young men and women. While the former favored Trump by an average of 11 percentage points, the latter favored Biden by 28 points.And while Harris' candidacy may have closed the Democrats enthusiasm gap, it's only widened the gender divide. The Times/Siena polls of six swing states last week showed a 51-point chasm between young men and women.Though polls show that Trump has made inroads with Gen Z, especially among young men, some argue the data is not reflective of the broader voting bloc. Jack Lobel, the national press secretary of left-leaning youth voter engagement organization Voters of Tomorrow, pointed out that many younger Americans wouldn't think to pick up the phone when pollsters call, and that the sample size in national polls are not large enough to draw any conclusive data.\"Polling young voters is very difficult,\" Lobel told Newsweek.He pointed instead to voter registration, which has shown an influx of young Democrats, and specialized surveys like the ones Voters of Tomorrow conducts. Last week, the group, which is backing Harris, released a new poll that sampled 1,601 voters aged 19 to 29 across seven battleground states. The survey found Harris leading Trump by 44 points among registered Gen Z voters in Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada and Wisconsin.Another issue that pollsters acknowledge is the diversity within Gen Z, which is generally considered to include those born from 1997 to 2012.\"The increased and sort of unprecedented diversity in this generation could be covering up some of those divergences that we're seeing elsewhere,\" Hrynowski, from Gallup, said.Gallup's data also found race-based gaps between Gen Z voters when it comes to party identification. Only one percent of Black respondents and six percent of Asian respondents identified as Republican, compared to 11% of Hispanic respondents and 2% of white respondents.There is one thing, however, that has unified Gen Z: economic anxieties. It is one of the working explanations behind the generation's conservative shift that Hrynowski and his team have explored.\"They were born into the aftermath of a global recession, in the middle of two ongoing wars, and since they've been born, they probably feel like the world has been moving pretty quickly,\" he said. \"There may just be a desire for stability.\"\"It's not necessarily adherence to large-C or Republican ideals so much as a slightly higher preference for small-c conservativism,\" he added.That is the theory that Republicans are hoping will give Trump a boost among young voters.\"Gen Z is being forced to grow up faster than any other generation has in the recent past because of the economic realities that they're facing,\" Morgan said. \"Why do they feel that the American Dream is harder to achieve? What economic factors are different than when their parents or their older siblings were entering the workforce and leaving college?\"Deckman said looking at her own research as well as testing from the progressive-leaning Young Men Research Initiative, young men are far more receptive to Harris' candidacy when the messaging focuses on policy, like economic proposals, than on the historic nature of Harris being the first female president if elected—a move that Harris already seems to have embraced in an effort to avoid Hillary Clinton's mistakes.But even if Harris is the candidate who is, as she says on the stump, willing to be a president for all Americans, Deckman said it's critical that the vice president comes up with a response to the political right's argument that the left has waged a war on masculinity.\"I don't think that most young men agree with that. I think it's a lot more complicated, but nonetheless, that's an argument that you're hearing,\" she said. \"So, I do think that the Democrats have to come up with a compelling narrative to say that those things aren't true at all. \"\"The #MeToo movement has been a powerful movement that has really galvanized young women, has made them aware of the fact that sexism is nothing of the past,\" she added. \"But in talking about toxic masculinity, there's some concern from some people that it might send the message to young men that there's something wrong with them. Trying to thread that needle and talk to young men is really important. It's a challenge for Democrats today.\"","summary":"Young Americans are more conservative than you think.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-gen-z-support-young-voters-1948309","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2463586/kamala-harris-gen-z.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-03 21:56:30","author":"Katherine Fung","authors":["Katherine Fung"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.31},{"id":255569194,"title":"Judge Rejects RFK Jr.'s Bid to Get Name Removed From Michigan Ballot","text":"A Michigan judge on Tuesday rejected Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s bid to get his name removed from the state's November presidential ballot.Kennedy, who dropped out of the 2024 presidential race last month, has attempted to pull himself off the Michigan ballot, previously filing a notice of withdrawal, but was first denied by state election officials.In response on Friday, Kennedy filed a lawsuit in Michigan's Court of Claims, suing Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.In a post on X earlier in the day, Benson cited Michigan law while saying that candidates who are nominated and accept a minor party's nomination \"shall not be permitted to withdraw.\"Kennedy argued in the lawsuit that his notice of withdrawal was timely and the electorate's votes could be \"diminished and rendered invalid\" if he remains on the ballot.Judge Christopher P. Yates on Tuesday affirmed that Benson was correct in rejecting Kennedy's bid to withdraw.In his ruling, Yates said: \"Elections are not just games, and the Secretary of State is not obligated to honor the whims of candidates for public office.\"Tuesday's decision echoes similar rulings in other states, including Wisconsin, where officials also refused Kennedy's withdrawal request last week.Kennedy, who endorsed former President Donald Trump instead of Vice President Kamala Harris, has been aiming to withdraw from \"about 10 battleground states\" where he could be a \"spoiler\" candidate.Newsweek has reached out to Kennedy's spokesperson via email for comment on Tuesday.Before withdrawing from the race, Kennedy's name was set to appear on the ballot in at least 23 states. He had already withdrawn his name from Arizona's ballot late last month, while in New York, a judge previously removed his name from the ballot due to a dispute over his listed residence.In the other 25 states, the Kennedy campaign launched petitions to put his name on the ballot. While the campaign did not acquire enough signatures to appear on the ticket in Kentucky, Mississippi, Rhode Island and Wyoming, petitions were pending in 21 of the states, according to CBS News.It was unclear which 10 battleground states Kennedy was referring to last month when he mentioned withdrawing his name. Of the states where his name was confirmed to appear, only Michigan and North Carolina are considered by most to be swing states. Kennedy filed a lawsuit in the Tar Heel State on Friday.The battleground states, including Michigan, will play a key role in determining the result of this year's election.Deadlines to withdraw candidacy have already passed in some states, including Pennsylvania, although withdrawals could likely still be achieved via court order.","summary":"Following attempts to remove his name from the state ballot, a Michigan judge has ruled Robert F.

The debate will be held in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center. The Harris campaign has agreed to the terms set forth in the initial agreement — the same terms used during the debate between Trump and President Biden in June. HARRIS PREPS FOR DEBATE WITH GOOGLE LAWYER, CREATING 'CONFLICT OF INTEREST,' TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS Biden’s debate performance against Trump led to his ouster, shaking up the election cycle and forcing a switch to the top of the Democrat ticket. Biden suspended his re-election campaign shortly after and endorsed Harris. \"We’re glad Kamala has finally agreed to the debate terms after trying to open up negotiations again,\" a Trump campaign official told Fox News Digital. The rules are as follows: no notes, no sitting, no audience and no open microphones. The Harris campaign had argued last month that microphones should be open, and not muted, throughout the debate but ultimately agreed to the initial terms. Ahead of next Tuesday’s debate, Trump is ramping up his campaign schedule with multiple events per day. Trump will be in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, for a town hall with Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Wednesday. On Thursday, Trump will travel to New York City to give a speech at the New York Economic Club. Later Thursday, he will deliver remarks to the Republican Jewish Coalition. On Friday, Trump is headed to North Carolina to meet with law enforcement groups, where he is expected to deliver remarks. On Saturday, the former president will hold a rally in Wisconsin. TRUMP ADDS RFK JR., TULSI GABBARD TO HIS TRANSITION TEAM AS HE RECRUITS SUPPORTERS 'ACROSS PARTISAN LINES' \"He uses rallies and speeches as a big part of debate prep,\" a campaign official told Fox News Digital. \"Meeting with voters and interacting with the press is a form of getting ready — you have seen him doing more media engagements in the last couple of weeks.\" The official added: \"In a lot of ways, that’s his preparation.\" Fox News Digital has learned that campaign senior adviser Jason Miller is leading debate preparations, with Stephen Miller and the policy team also involved. As for the Harris campaign, Fox News Digital reported last month that the vice president had recruited Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison attorney Karen Dunn to help with debate prep. Dunn helped prepare Harris for her 2020 vice presidential debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence. Dunn is simultaneously working as Google’s lead defense attorney in the Biden-Harris administration’s lawsuit against the tech giant. That lawsuit, United States v. Google LLC, is the Biden-Harris administration’s antitrust lawsuit targeting Google’s digital advertising practices. The trial is set to begin Sept. 9 — a day before the first presidential debate.

Pat Toomey, a Republican who represented Pennsylvania for over a decade, told CNBC that he will not vote for either candidate this year despite having backed Trump in the last two elections. “When you lose an election and you try to overturn the results so that you can stay in power, you lose me,” Toomey told CNBC, referring to Trump’s false claims that he was cheated out of the White House in 2020. “You lose me at that point.” “I acknowledge that the outcome is a binary situation, but my choice is not,” he continued. “It is an acceptable position for me to say that neither of these candidates can be my choice for president.” The former senator also called it “absolutely essential” that Republicans win back the Senate if Harris wins the White House, due to her recent tax proposals. Harris said she supports a plan that would require Americans worth at least $100 million to pay taxes on unrealized gains. Currently, the government only taxes profits from stocks — known as capital gains — once they’re sold. Under her proposal, these assets would be taxed as they gain value, regardless of whether they’ve been sold. This new tax would only impact some 10,000 wealthy Americans. Harris has also released other tax proposals, including increasing the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 21 percent. The plan could reduce the deficit by $1 trillion over 10 years, according to analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Toomey’s state is one of seven swing states that will play a deciding role in the outcome of November’s election. Harris has a lead Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, with Trump holding strong in Nevada, according to recent polling. Meanwhile, the vice president has a 3.3-point lead over the former president, according to the latest average of national polls. Pennsylvania is now a main target for multi-million-dollar ad campaigns. The Republican Voters Against Trump campaign is spending $4.5 million in Pennsylvania for a 30-second ad featuring testimonials from GOP voters who say they’re voting for Harris. The Democratic National Committee also ran digital billboards in Pennsylvania on Labor Day that featured a photo of the former president with the caption, “Trump’s an anti-union scab!”","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris is currently polling ahead in most swing states, including Pennsylvania","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/pat-toomey-trump-harris-2024-election-b2606505.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/03/21/GettyImages-1412717529.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-03 21:46:02","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":255571186,"title":"Billboard crowns Post Malone's 'I Had Some Help' song of the summer","text":"With the fall not far off, Billboard has announced the song took that the top spot on its Songs of the Summer chart: \"I Had Some Help\" by Post Malone featuring Morgan Wallen. The summer songs chart tracks the popularity of a tune based on weekly streaming, airplay and sales data between Memorial Day and Labor Day, which totals 14 weeks. \"I Had Some Help\" was No. 1 on the chart for all 14 weeks. This is the second year in a row that a country song has snagged the song of the summer title, according to Billboard's chart. Wallen also topped the summer songs chart in 2023 with his song \"Last Night.\" Country artist Shaboozey's \"A Bar Song (Tipsy)\" was the second-most popular song this summer, followed by rapper Kendrick Lamar's diss track \"Not Like Us\" at No. 3. Songs from Charli XCX’s “Brat” were noticeably absent from the summer songs chart. The album spawned a trend called “brat summer” in which people were encouraged to be their messy, unfiltered selves. The trend was inescapable this summer, with the Kamala Harris campaign embracing it and the album cover’s distinctive green color taking over social media. Charli XCX declared brat summer was over in an X post on Monday: “goodbye forever brat summer.” Music fans on X, which remains a popular platform among fan communities, debated the results on Tuesday. Many were surprised that \"Not Like Us\" or Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” were not in the top spot. \"Espresso,\" an early contender for song of the summer, finished at No. 4 on the Billboard chart. Billboard's senior director of music Jason Lipshutz told NBC News in May that the definition of song of the summer has changed in recent years as music has become more personalized. \"Colloquially, the song of the summer doesn’t even need to be a huge chart hit,” Lipshutz said at the time. “It’s just going to be what defines someone’s summer, whether it’s something they heard on the radio a lot or something they’re listening to on their own streaming service.” Recently, apps like Spotify and TikTok have also tracked their own songs of the summer, which align closely with what has trended online over the course of the past few months. Spotify determined its songs of the summer based on streams and cultural relevance as determined by its editorial staff. Like Billboard, Spotify included \"A Bar Song (Tipsy),\" \"Not Like Us,\" \"Espresso\" and Billie Eilish's \"Birds of a Feather.\" But it also deemed \"Hot to Go,\" by Chappell Roan, a song of the summer, nodding to Roan's explosive growth and the song's increasing popularity over the course of the season. Roan did not have a song on Billboard's Songs of the Summer chart. \"In many ways, it has been the summer of Chappell, with 'Hot To Go!' emerging as a 2024 festival favorite and becoming one of Spotify’s wild card picks in our midsummer update,\" Spotify shared in a newsroom post about the songs of the summer. Meanwhile, according to TikTok, which remains a crucial tool for music discovery, Tommy Richman's \"Million Dollar Baby\" was the top song on the platform this summer. The title was determined by how many posts used the song over the course of the season. \"Million Dollar Baby\" landed at No. 5 on Billboard's Songs of the Summer chart. It was followed by Carpenter's “Please Please Please,” folk pop singer Hozier's \"Too Sweet,\" singer-songwriter Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” Eilish's “Birds of a Feather” and pop-rock singer Benson Boone's \"Beautiful Things.\"","summary":"With the fall not far off, Billboard has announced the song took that the top spot on its Songs of the Summer chart: \"I Had Some Help\" by Post Malone featuring Morgan Wallen.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/billboard-crowns-post-malones-help-song-summer-rcna168657","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-09/240903-post-malone-morgan-wallen-ew-412p-767731.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-03 21:44:41","author":"Daysia Tolentino","authors":["Daysia Tolentino"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.387},{"id":255568878,"title":"Pingree campaigns for Harris-Walz on health policy","text":"U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree stumped for the Harris-Walz campaign on Tuesday by contrasting health care policy differences between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Pingree appeared in a virtual news conference organized by the Harris campaign, alongside state Rep. Jessica Fay, D-Raymond, and other health advocates. Pingree, D-1st District, said that a second Trump presidency – he was president from 2017-20 – would result in drastic cutbacks to Medicare and Medicaid, more attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and a potential national abortion ban. “It’s a recipe for disaster,” Pingree said, pointing to the Project 2025 plan that was penned by former Trump advisers but has been recently disavowed by Trump on the campaign trail. Trump has attempted to distance himself from Project 2025, and has also vowed to protect Medicare and Social Security. “I don’t know anything about it,” Trump said at a July rally in Michigan about Project 2025. “I don’t want to know anything about it.” But Democrats, including Pingree, say the proposals contained in Project 2025 closely mirror Trump’s approach to health care policy. “One of our biggest concerns is that if Trump is elected, if he were to also have control of the House and Senate, there would be very likely a national ban on abortion,” Pingree said. Trump has said he’s proud of appointing Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe vs. Wade – a decades-long goal of social conservatives that allowed individual states to set their own restrictions. And he has said he wants to leave the decision to individual states. In a recent interview he seemed to indicate he would vote “yes” on a pro-abortion rights ballot initiative in Florida, where he lives. But after a conservative backlash, Trump’s campaign issued a statement saying Trump would instead vote “no.” Harris is making abortion rights a key component of her campaign. If Harris wins, and Democrats win control of the House and hold the Senate, Pingree said Democrats would aim to codify abortion rights in federal law, expand Medicaid and Medicare, focusing on maintaining and improving services in rural areas of the nation. “We’d go for it all, and try to do it as quickly as possible,” said Pingree, who also is running for reelection to a 9th term in the House of Representatives. Trump campaign officials did not respond to a request for information about Trump’s health care priorities on Tuesday. Trump and congressional Republicans tried numerous times to repeal the Affordable Care Act when Trump was president. But those efforts failed by a slim margin, including in 2017 with Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and the late John McCain of Arizona voting to maintain former President Obama’s signature domestic achievement. In 2023, Trump vowed again to replace the ACA, but this year he has instead vowed to improve the health insurance law. “We’re going to make the ACA much better than it is right now, and much less expensive for you,” Trump said in a video to supporters this spring. Trump has not yet unveiled detailed plans on what he would change about the ACA.","summary":"U.S. Rep.

Democrats have stressed they welcome Harris’s visit to the state after last month’s convention in Chicago and ahead of the presidential debate against Trump next week. “We are just so excited, but that’s because we’re Democrats,” New Hampshire Democratic state Sen. David Watters told the Washington Examiner. “She believes that Democrats should ask for every vote and understand what’s at stake for our democracy, and this is an important state for that.” Harris is expected to propose a tenfold expansion of the small business tax deduction for startup expenses, from $5,000 to $50,000, according to a campaign official, to meet the need for the average cost of starting a business at $40,000. She will also propose policies that cut red tape to make it easier for small business owners to file taxes and reduce barriers to getting occupational licenses. The vice president is also expected to set a goal of 25 million new small business applications in her first four years of office, which will surpass the 19 million applications set under the Biden administration. This comes after Harris’s first economic proposals were released last month, which included cutting taxes for the middle class and reducing grocery costs. “The message now about working families, about the middle class, and particularly about small businesses, New Hampshire is just really an ideal place for that message,” said Watters. “So that’s why she’s back.” Other New Hampshire experts suggested Harris’s visit may have to do with the drama surrounding the state after President Joe Biden and the Democratic National Committee stripped the Granite State of its first-place status in the primary calendar. However, New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan defied the wishes of the Democratic Party and set the primary on Jan. 23, 2024, ahead of South Carolina’s primary, due to a 1975 law requiring New Hampshire to hold the nation’s first primary. Biden declined to compete in the race, and allies staged a successful write-in campaign. “It’s a state that is going to have a very competitive gubernatorial race, and she may want to build some points here if she wins in 2024 and wants to seek reelection in 2028,” said Linda Fowler, a political scientist at Dartmouth University, about Harris’s visit. “The Democratic Party here was very angry with Biden because we lost our first-in-the-nation status. So I think this may be politics in the sense of restoring ties with a local party.” Watters was a key leader in the Biden write-in campaign and claimed that state Democrats were no longer angered by loss of status even during the primary. “I really think even at the time of the primary, those tensions were all gone, and we felt very good about that effort,” he said. “And frankly, I think that the reason why our delegation met that very day that President Biden made his decision (to suspend his campaign) and unanimously voted to endorse Harris was that we understand the extraordinary work that the president did, but also that Vice President Harris—all the conversations in the weeks before that moment had been that she really is our strongest candidate,” Watters continued. Others claimed Harris’s visit to New Hampshire, along with her running mate’s, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), campaigning in Virginia, was an attempt to distance herself from Clinton’s decision not to visit Wisconsin during the 2016 campaign when she lost to Trump. “I think that they’re scared of the ghost of Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin,” said Sean Spicer, a former Trump White House press secretary, during The Morning Meeting. “I have a feeling that they’d rather be making the case that they’re expanding the map and that they’re keeping things off the board.” Trump took to Truth Social on Tuesday to slam Harris’s arrival in New Hampshire, her economic policies while serving as vice president, and Democrats devaluing the state in its primary schedule. “Comrade Kamala Harris sees there are problems for her campaign in New Hampshire because of the fact that they disrespected it in their primary and never showed up,” he wrote. “Additionally, the cost of living in New Hampshire is through the roof, their energy bills are some of highest in the country, and their housing market is the most unaffordable in history. I protected New Hampshire’s First-In-The-Nation Primary and ALWAYS will!” Christopher Galdieri, a political scientist at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, suggested that Harris’s visit is a move to shore up support in a race that a handful of states will decide. “We are sort of at the top of the second tier of battleground states. We’re not where we were in, say, 2008 (or) 2012,” said Galdieri. “But I think it’s just making sure you make the appearance. She has not been here as the nominee, so I think it’s also useful for her to visit the state for that reason as well.” A volunteer for the Trump campaign was let go from his post after he stated New Hampshire was not winnable for the GOP. According to the Boston Globe, Tom Mountain, who is a former Massachusetts Republican Party vice chairman, emailed Trump campaign volunteers claiming that “the campaign has determined that New Hampshire is no longer a battleground state” and that Trump is “sure to lose by an even higher margin” in New Hampshire than in 2016 and 2020. Mountain also pointed to Pennsylvania as a state more deserving of resources. A 538 poll average of New Hampshire shows Harris leading Trump by roughly seven percentage points, 50.1% to 43.2%, while a RealClearPolitics poll average also shows Harris leading Trump by five percentage points, 50.7% to 45.7%. The Cook Political Report also rates the state as “likely Democratic.” “New Hampshire has what I think is probably a very favorable electorate for Harris,” said Galdieri. “It is lots of upscale, highly educated, white voters. So I think it’s a very particular segment of the Democratic electorate. So I think it’s going to be pretty friendly territory.” Throughout the state, Democrats have amassed more than 100 campaign staffers across 17 coordinated field offices, compared to the one field office the Trump campaign has opened. In a similar trend found across other battleground states, Democrats in New Hampshire saw a 415% increase in event attendees and a 480% increase in volunteer shifts after Harris replaced Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee. Although Trump easily won the New Hampshire GOP primary earlier this year, it remained a top state in which Republican Nikki Haley attempted to stage her comeback against the former president. Trump defeated Haley by 11 percentage points, 54.3% to 43.3%. Those same disaffected Haley voters could defect for Harris come November in addition to the Republicans for Harris group that has started in the state. Former Republican Rep. Joe Walsh stumped for the Harris campaign last week in the state.

One is to expand the playing field, make the Republicans fight for everything,” said Fowler. “And the other is to not take states that look like they’re in the blue column — not take those for granted.”","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris is set to visit the greater Portsmouth, New Hampshire, area Wednesday, where she will unveil new proposals targeting small businesses as she seeks to contrast her economic policies against former President Donald Trump.

And not only that. The Fed's high interest rates, Powell said, had managed to achieve that goal without causing a widely predicted recession and high unemployment. Yet most Americans are not in the same celebratory mood about the plummeting of inflation in the face of the high borrowing rates the Fed engineered. Though consumer sentiment is slowly rising, a majority of Americans in some surveys still complain about elevated prices, given that the costs of such necessities as food, gas and housing remain far above where they were before the pandemic erupted in 2020. The relatively sour mood of the public is creating challenges for Vice President Kamala Harris as she seeks to succeed President Joe Biden. Despite the fall of inflation and strong job growth, many voters say they're dissatisfied with the Biden-Harris administration's economic record — and especially frustrated by high prices. That disparity points to a striking gap between how economists and policymakers assess the past several years of the economy and how many ordinary Americans do. In his remarks last month, given at an annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Powell underscored how the Fed's sharp rate hikes succeeded much more than most economists had predicted in taming inflation without hammering the economy — a notoriously difficult feat known as a “soft landing.” “Some argued that getting inflation under control would require a recession and a lengthy period of high unemployment,” Powell said. Ultimately, though, he noted, “the 4-1/2 percentage point decline in inflation from its peak two years ago has occurred in a context of low unemployment — a welcome and historically unusual result.” With high inflation now essentially conquered, Powell and other central bank officials are preparing to cut their key interest rate in mid-September for the first time in more than four years. The Fed is becoming more focused on sustaining the job market with the help of lower interest rates than on continuing to fight inflation. Many consumers, by contrast, are still preoccupied most by today's price levels. “From the viewpoint of economists, central bankers, how we think about inflation, it really has been a remarkable success, how inflation went up, has come back, and is around the target,” said Kristin Forbes, an economist at MIT and a former official at the United Kingdom's central bank, the Bank of England. “But from the viewpoint of households, it has not been so successful,” she added. “Many have taken a big hit to their wages. Many of them feel like the basket of goods they buy is now much more expensive.” Two years ago, economists feared that the Fed’s ongoing rate hikes — it ultimately raised its benchmark rate more than 5 percentage points to a 23-year high in the fastest pace in four decades — would hammer the economy and cause millions of job losses. After all, that’s what happened when the Fed under Chair Paul Volcker sent its benchmark rate to nearly 20% in the early 1980s, ultimately throttling a brutal inflationary spell. In fact, at Jackson Hole two years ago, Powell himself warned that using high interest rates to defeat the inflation spike “would bring some pain to households and businesses.” Yet now, according to the Fed’s preferred measure, inflation is 2.5%, not far above its 2% target. And while a weaker pace of hiring has caused some concerns, the unemployment rate is at a still-low 4.3%, and the economy expanded at a solid 3% annual rate last quarter. While no Fed official will outright declare victory, some take satisfaction in defying the predictions of doom and gloom. “2023 was a historic year for inflation falling,” said Austan Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed. “And there wasn’t a recession, and that’s unprecedented. And so we will be studying the mechanics of how that happened for a long time.” Measures of consumer sentiment, though, indicate that three years of hurtful inflation have dimmed many Americans’ outlook. In addition, high loan rates, along with elevated housing prices, have led many young workers to fear that homeownership is increasingly out of reach. Last month, the consulting firm McKinsey said that 53% of consumers in its most recent survey “still say that rising prices and inflation are among their concerns.” McKinsey's analysts attributed the escalated figure to “an ‘inflation overhang.\" That's the belief among analysts that it can take months, if not years, for consumers to adjust emotionally to a much higher level of prices even if their pay is keeping pace. Economists point to several reasons for the wide gap in perceptions between economists and policymakers on the one hand and everyday consumers and workers on the other. The first is that the Fed tailors its interest rate policies to manage inflation — the rate of price changes — rather than price levels themselves. So when inflation spikes, the central bank's goal is to return it to a sustainable level, currently defined as 2%, rather than to reverse the price increases. The Fed's policymakers expect average wages to catch up and eventually to allow consumers to afford the higher prices. “Central bankers think even if inflation gets away from 2% for a period, as long as it comes back, that’s fine,” Forbes said. \"Victory, mission accomplished. But the amount of time inflation is away from 2% can have a major cost.” Research by Stefanie Stantcheva, a Harvard economist, and two colleagues found that most people's views of inflation are very different from those of economists. Economists in general are more likely to regard inflation as a consequence of strong growth. They often describe inflation as a result of an “overheating” economy: Low unemployment, strong job growth and rising wages lead businesses to sharply increase prices without necessarily losing sales. By contrast, a survey by Stantcheva found, ordinary Americans “view inflation as an unambiguously bad thing and very rarely as a sign of a good economy or as a byproduct of positive developments.” Her survey respondents also said they believed that inflation stems from excessive government spending or greedy businesses. They “do not believe that (central bank) policymakers face trade-offs, such as having to reduce economic activity or increase unemployment to control inflation.” As a result, few consumers probably worried about the potential for a downturn as a result of the Fed's rate hikes. One opinion survey, in fact, found that many consumers believed, incorrectly, that the economy was in a recession because inflation was so high. At the Jackson Hole conference, Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, argued that central banks cannot guarantee that high inflation will never appear — only that they will try to drive it back down when it does. “I get this question quite often in Parliament,\" Bailey said. “People say, ‘Well you failed to control inflation.’ I said no.” The test of a central bank, he continued, “is not that we will never have inflation. The test of the regime is how well, once you get hit by these shocks, you bring it back to target.” Still, Forbes suggested that there are lessons to be learned from the post-COVID inflation spike, including whether inflation was allowed to stay too high for too long, both in the U.S. and the U.K. The Fed has long been criticized for having taken too long to start raising its benchmark rate. Inflation first spiked in the spring of 2021. Yet the Fed, under the mistaken impression that high inflation would prove “transitory,\" didn't begin raising rates until nearly a year later. “Maybe should we rethink ... where we seem to be now: ‘As long as it comes back four to five years later, that’s fine,’ ” she said. “Maybe four to five years is too long. \"How much unemployment or slowdown in growth should we be willing to accept to shorten the length of time that inflation is too high?” © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.
