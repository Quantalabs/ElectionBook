Let us know that the reality is that the progress of our nation has been about the expansion of rights, not the restriction of rights.”\n\nAs she spoke in K turns, her disheveled hair fell into her face. And with every inane declaration, her eyes bulged like ET and her chin receded into her head. It’s the face one makes when they’ve been studying the complete works of Kendall Jackson.\n\n“We have to be clear-eyed. And it doesn’t mean we don’t see the beauty in everything. These things all co-exist, but I believe we fight for something, not against something,” she continued.\n\nAnd to think, in an alternative brat universe, this would be our president.\n\nThe timing was poignant because only days earlier, our Vice President JD Vance was in Munich, delivering an important, bold and substantive speech about the perils of creeping censorship — and unchecked mass migration.\n\nVance was doing some much needed heavy lifting, especially after “60 Minutes” unwittingly underscored his point. Last night it aired a segment on Germany’s approach to combating online “hate speech” which included an early morning raid of a man’s apartment by six cops. His crime was posting something online.\n\nIt was chilling to see the three prosecutors positively giddy about taking away citizens’ phones like overzealous hall moniters bent on infantilizing and stifling an entire society.\n\nThough VP, Vance is tackling, head on, the defining issues of our time — the inconvenient truths that threaten Western Civilization and the European democracies.\n\nAnd while I watched him make waves with this historic and hefty speech, my mind floated to Harris. She had been on the national stage for close to a decade and I still know very little about her ideological positions. The only clarity she provided were far left ideas during ‘the great awokening’.\n\nThen her movement to the center during the election was relayed by her spokespeople and never challenged by the media. With the exception of Brett Baier, she was never pushed to explain herself. Even“60 Minutes” had to heavily edit her interivew to create semi coherent answers.\n\nThe lone useless sentiment she can regularly communicate is that she firmly believes Americans have hopes and dreams. They have aspirations.\n\nAnd then she appears at the show, sure it was in a casual context, but what I believe to be her default setting — it only affirmed that our country made the right decision.\n\nAnd the contrast between her and Vance — and yes Trump — couldn’t be more striking. Her intellectual offerings are far more feeble in comparison.\n\nNot only was Harris not right for this moment in time, she is simply not good at this. She was out of her depth in so many ways.\n\nShe did, however, warn she would not “go quietly into the night” after losing in November.\n\nBut if the Dems don’t have the good sense to “unburden” themselves “by what has been” and drop her, they won’t win anytime soon. And they don’t deserve to either.","summary":"“We have to be clear-eyed. And it doesn’t mean we don’t see the beauty in everything.

horseback border agents after false accusations of whipping migrants: sources","text":"Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has “personally apologized” to US Border Patrol’s horseback agents after the previous Biden administration wrongly accused them of whipping migrants.\n\nImages of the horse-riding agents trying to control a surge of roughly 14,000 Haitian migrants who arrived at the small border town of Del Rio, Texas, went viral in September 2021 — and top members of the then-Biden administration and Democrat lawmakers jumped to conclusions and wrongly asserted that the law-enforcement workers were whipping the illegal border-crossers.\n\nNoem, during a recent visit to the Del Rio border, expressed regret to the agents “for the way they were treated and mentioned that it should have never happened,” said a Homeland Security source with knowledge of the situation to The Post.\n\nThe whipping accusations had been swiftly debunked by the photographer who captured the incident and later through an official Customs and Border Protection investigation.\n\nYet just days after the images surfaced — and after the photog who took them denied the whipping allegations — then-Vice President Kamala Harris told the “View” that the snaps “invoked images of some of the worst moments of our history, where that kind of behavior has been used against the Indigenous people of our country, it has been used against African Americans during times of slavery.”\n\nThen-President Joe Biden also called the images “outrageous,” pledging that the agents “will pay,” the day after the photographer dismissed the false whipping claims.\n\nNoem’s predecessor, Alejandro Mayorkas, was eventually forced to walk back his own quick criticism of the horseback agents.\n\n“I made the statements without having seen the images,” he admitted to reporters at the time.\n\n“The horses have long reins, and the image in the photograph that we all saw, and that horrified the nation, raised serious questions about what … occurred and as I stated quite clearly, it conjured up images of what has occurred in the past,” Mayorkas said, referring to slavery in the US.\n\nNearly a year after the viral incident, the whipping claim unraveled for good after an internal federal probe found that there was no such actions that day.\n\nStill, the probe did determine that the agents “engaged in unprofessional or dangerous behavior, including one instance in which an agent used denigrating and offensive language.”\n\n“Whips are not part of Border Patrol training or equipment,” the then-CBP acting commissioner Chris Magnus said at the time.\n\nSince President Trump took office Jan. 20, illegal border crossings have plummeted to historic lows.\n\nIn the first eleven days of February, Border Patrol agents have seen an average of 359 illegal migrants crossing a day, putting the US on track to have the lowest monthly numbers in at least 25 years, according to leaked Customs and Border Protection data obtained by The Post.\n\nBorder Patrol sources credit Trump’s decision to end the country’s problematic “catch and release” program, deploy thousands of additional soldiers to the border and ramp up a mass deportation effort for the slowdown.","summary":"Noem, during a recent visit to the Del Rio border, expressed regret to the agents \"for the way they were treated and

Into North Virginia Schools For Transgender Support Policies","text":"The U.S. Education Department is currently investigating five school districts in Northern Virginia for potential violations of Title IX and a recent executive order issued by President Trump regarding transgender students. The investigation focuses on whether these districts have allowed transgender students to use their chosen name and pronouns, as well as access restrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity.\nThe Investigation Into Northern Virginia School Districts\nOn Wednesday, the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights opened investigations into five school districts: Arlington, Alexandria, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William County. This follows a request made earlier this month by the conservative organization America First Legal, which was founded by Stephen Miller, a former White House deputy chief of staff. The group alleges that these school districts are enforcing policies that support transgender students in a way that violates Title IX, the federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in educational settings.\nEach of the school districts under investigation has policies that allow transgender students to access facilities, such as restrooms and locker rooms, that match their gender identity. Additionally, these policies require staff to address transgender students by their chosen name and pronouns.\nAmerica First Legal's Complaint and Trump's Executive Order\nAmerica First Legal claims that these policies conflict with a January 29 executive order issued by President Trump, which targets public schools promoting what his administration describes as “gender ideology.” The executive order includes a provision that prohibits schools from supporting students' social gender transition. A social transition typically involves changing one’s name, pronouns, and clothing to reflect their gender identity, but does not involve medical intervention.\nThe group argues that the policies adopted by these school districts give greater rights to students whose gender identity does not align with their biological sex than to those whose gender identity does match their biological sex. America First Legal asserts that these policies essentially erase the concept of biological sex in favor of gender identity, and in doing so, they are violating the principle of non-discrimination based on sex.\nSchool Districts' Reactions\nThe Education Department has not yet provided a comment regarding the ongoing investigations. However, the school districts involved in the complaint are in predominantly liberal areas of Virginia, which were won by Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. These districts have previously resisted calls from Governor Glenn Youngkin’s administration to roll back protections for transgender students.\nYoungkin’s Education Department introduced model policies in 2023 that would have limited transgender students' access to facilities and sports teams based on their gender identity. These policies also included provisions that would allow students and teachers to misgender transgender students. The model policies sparked protests from students across the state, but they did not have an enforcement mechanism.\nPrince William County Public Schools (PWCS) confirmed to The Hill on Monday that it has been notified of the investigation and will cooperate. A spokesperson from PWCS said, “PWCS will, of course, cooperate with the investigation. PWCS remains committed to providing a welcoming, nurturing learning environment where all of our students feel safe and supported mentally, physically, and emotionally.”\nLoudoun County Public Schools also acknowledged the investigation and stated that it would respond according to the law. Representatives from Arlington, Alexandria, and Fairfax school districts did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nBroader Context of Investigations Into Transgender Policies\nThe Education Department’s investigation into these Virginia school districts is part of a broader trend of probes into public schools and athletic associations that support transgender students. In recent weeks, the department has opened an investigation into an all-gender bathroom at a Denver high school and has launched inquiries into two state athletic associations that defied Trump’s executive order banning transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women’s sports.\nAdditionally, the Education Department is investigating another state sports association and two colleges over alleged violations of Title IX related to transgender athletes competing on women’s teams. These actions highlight ongoing debates over the rights of transgender students in educational institutions and the intersection of federal regulations with state-level policies.\nALSO READ: Five Arrested In The Brutal Murder Of Transgender Man Sam Nordquist After Weeks Of Torture","summary":"The U.S. Education Department is currently investigating five school districts in Northern Virginia for potential violations of Title IX and a recent executive order issued by President Trump regarding transgender students.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/us-education-department-investigates-into-north-virginia-schools-for-transgender-support-policies/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/US-education.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-17 23:10:41","author":"Srishti Mukherjee","authors":["Srishti Mukherjee"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.203},{"id":291556940,"title":"Kamala Harris mocked over 'word salad' speech to cast of ‘A Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical’","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a so-called nonsensical \"word salad\" during an attempt to deliver an inspirational message to the cast of Broadway’s \"A Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical.\" Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, were seen attending two Broadway productions over the weekend, the other being \"Gypsy,\" the New York Post reported.

Before hundreds of supporters gathered in Riverside, Bianco, 58, said the California dream had \"turned into a nightmare\" for people struggling with rising prices for food, groceries, electricity and housing. \"What is it that they have given us?\" Bianco said of Democrats. \"Rampant crime, higher taxes, the highest cost of living in our nation, tent encampments in every major city, more fentanyl deaths, catastrophic fires, a broken homeowners' insurance market. ... Californians deserve better.\" As some of his supporters waved signs that read, \"California is home. You don't have to move,\" Bianco said he was \"tired of my friends leaving the state. I'm tired of watching my friends' kids leave this state.\" Bianco is the highest profile Republican to enter the 2026 race to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom, joining a crowded field of Democrats. Newsom is serving his second term and cannot run again. Bianco was elected Riverside County sheriff in 2018 and reelected in 2022. He has built a statewide profile as a vocal critic of Newsom and the state Legislature's Democratic supermajority. He's drawn headlines for his refusal to enforce potential vaccine mandates for Sheriff's Department employees during the COVID-19 pandemic; a civil rights investigation into his department by state prosecutors, which Bianco has said is politically motivated; and his support for Proposition 36, the ballot measure voters approved last fall to stiffen criminal penalties for theft and fentanyl dealing. \"We won that fight, and we won it big,\" Bianco said of Proposition 36. The California electorate's two-thirds support for the measure, he said, was a repudiation of Democratic leaders who \"tried their best to keep it off our ballot, to prevent all of you from forcing them to do what was right.\" The last Republican to be elected governor in California was Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006. About one in four voters in California is a registered Republican, compared with almost 46% who are Democrats and 22% who have no party preference. Bianco told the crowd that his campaign will not be about party politics, but \"about the common goal we all have for a better California.\" He later told reporters: \"I have to be a Republican, because they make us register as something.\" Pam Nusser of Riverside said Bianco won her support during the pandemic, when he refused to enforce health department orders to close businesses, including her barbecue restaurant. \"I love him,\" Nusser said. \"He can't be intimidated and he can't be bought.\" Bianco last year joined a coalition of sheriffs from across the U.S. who endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' tough stance on immigration, which included transporting immigrants to so-called sanctuary cities across the country. This month, he swatted aside rumors that Riverside County sheriff's deputies were assisting with immigration raids at schools and churches, saying his deputies would not assist with \"any type of immigration enforcement.\" He said he would \"do everything I can within the confines of the sanctuary state laws of California\" to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to \"remove criminals from our jails.\" Bianco also faced scrutiny after a data leak revealed that in 2014 he had been a member of the Oath Keepers, a far-right group whose members participated in the pro-Trump insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Bianco later said he didn't renew his membership because the organization \"did not offer me anything.\" Nearly a year and a half before the primary election in June of 2026, the race for governor is still wide open. The biggest question mark is whether former Vice President Kamala Harris, a Bay Area native who lives in Los Angeles, will jump into the fray. Bianco said he hoped so. \"To run against her and her history in California, I'd welcome that,\" Bianco said. Harris' entry could spell bad news for the current field of Democrats, including Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, state schools chief Tony Thurmond, former state Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and businessman and philanthropist Stephen Cloobeck. Other well-known Democrats said to be considering a run for governor include former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter of Irvine and former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. Other potential Republican candidates include conservative commentator Steve Hilton and former state Sen. Brian Dahle, who ran against Newsom in 2022.","summary":"In announcing bid for governor, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco says the California dream has 'turned into a nightmare' for people struggling with soaring prices.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-02-17/riverside-sheriff-chad-bianco-2026-california-governors-race-gavin-newsom","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4025b55/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3925x2061+0+278/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F49%2Fe5%2Fda28cc844e5b80f7a1e578255259%2F1494886-me-sheriff-b","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-17 22:32:00","author":"Laura J.

Mark Milley that Trump was a “fascist,” Republicans called foul. Mitch McConnell, the then-Senate Republican leader, said that it would encourage a would-be assassin to “finish the job.” \n\nBut over the weekend, Trump raged against courts that have blocked his numerous executive actions as president, saying on X that “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.” The quote is reportedly attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte, though it is unclear whether the French emperor actually said the quote.\n\nNo major Republicans pushed back against the comments. This comes despite the fact that Republicans repeatedly filed lawsuits to challenge the Biden and Obama administrations. \n\nTrump’s words came after the Department of Justice dropped charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams in exchange for Adams’s compliance in enforcing Trump’s aggressive anti-immigration agenda. Once again, there was almost not a whisper from major lawmakers.\n\nThe Trump administration also petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to give him permission to fire Hampton Dellinger, who leads the office of Special Counsel.\n\nAs of right now, there are no signs that Republicans are going to do anything to push back. Last week, the Senate voted to confirm Tulsi Gabbard to director of National Intelligence and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to become secretary of Health and Human Services. Even Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, self-styled moderates who served as major roadblocks in Trump’s first term, went along with the rest of the Senate GOP conference.\n\nThis came despite the fact that Gabbard and Kennedy – both former Democrats – staunchly contradict Republican orthodoxy: Gabbard only seemed to find religion on surveillance when she came up for nomination and Kennedy previously defended abortion rights and criticized Republican policies on the environment, but has become a darling on the right because of his anti-vaccine views.\n\nIronically, McConnell, who ceded the reins of the GOP conference to Majority Leader John Thune, was the sole Republican to oppose both Gabbard and Kennedy’s nominations. He also opposed the nomination of Pete Hegseth to lead the Department of Defense a few weeks ago. \n\nNone of those should be surprising. McConnell is a conventional military hawk who saw Hegseth as an amateur unprepared to lead the Pentagon. His support for Ukraine meant he would never support someone who in the past praised Vladimir Putin and the fact he survived polio as a child meant he could never stomach an anti-vaccine conspiracist like Kennedy.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Trump responded with vitriol, openly questioning whether McConnell even had polio and questioning his mental competency. \n\nThis is not the first time that Trump has attacked a Republican elder statesman so personally. He famously called the late John McCain “a war hero because he was captured” when he kicked off his 2015. And Trump and McConnell suffered a break after the senator refused to help overturn the 2020 election results. That rift would be sealed by the January 6 riot, though McConnell’s decision to acquit Trump paved the way for the president’s return in 2024.\n\nBut back in 2015, Republicans almost universally condemned Trump and praised McCain. \n\nThis time around, Republicans won’t say a peep about the person who led their conference for 17 years and who arguably cemented the longest-lasting aspect of Trump’s first term: reshaping the federal judiciary. \n\nIn the same token, few Republicans, including the most hawkish Republicans, pushed back on J.D. Vance’s speech in Munich, where Trump’s vice president railed not against Russia or threats abroad but against European governments for supposedly repressing free speech and for their immigration policies. \n\nIn the past, elder Republican statesmen – the “adults in the room” – would find a way to soothe global fears or find ways to reassure world leaders that they would stick to their global commitments.\n\nBut no such cavalry is coming this time. \n\nThis is not to say that Trump faces no roadblocks. Democratic attorneys general have repeatedly filed lawsuits against the administration in hopes of slowing down its actions. \n\nBut for the time being, expect almost no dissent from within the ranks of Republican lawmakers. And a lack of dissent will equal permission in Trump’s eyes.","summary":"ANALYSIS: The president may be insulting McConnell and quoting Napoleon, but no one should expect any resistance from the current Republican party, writes Eric Garcia","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-napoleon-guardrails-republicans-mcconnell-b2699765.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/17/19/SEI240252359.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/GlsMjXtD-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-17 22:14:47","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.036},{"id":291551284,"title":"Riverside County sheriff becomes the first major Republican to say he’ll run for California governor","text":"RIVERSIDE, Calif.

El comisionado de Agricultura, Wilton Simpson, registró un 3%, y el alcalde de Miami, Francis Suárez, apenas un 1%.\n\nEl expresidente Trump no hizo comentarios adicionales en su publicación, dejando que los resultados de la encuesta hablaran por sí mismos.\n\nDonalds aún no ha anunciado oficialmente su candidatura para 2026, pero, según un informe de NBC News publicado el mes pasado, ya ha comenzado a comunicar a sus donantes su intención de postularse.\n\nSi Trump eventualmente respalda a Donalds, esto podría colocarlo nuevamente en un enfrentamiento con DeSantis, tras la competencia entre ambos en las primarias presidenciales republicanas de 2024.\n\nDeSantis anunció el mes pasado que reactivará su comité político para el ciclo electoral de 2026.\n\nEse comité, el Florida Freedom Fund, ha recaudado más de $8.6 millones y gastado más de $6.5 millones desde su creación en mayo del año pasado, según el sitio web de la División de Elecciones de Florida.\n\n\"El FL Freedom Fund fue fundamental para recaudar grandes sumas de dinero y derrotar las Enmiendas 3 y 4 en 2024\", publicó DeSantis en X (antes Twitter) el 30 de enero.\n\n\"Para el ciclo de 2026, el FFF recaudará aún más recursos (1) para garantizar apoyo a un fuerte candidato conservador a la gobernación y (2) para respaldar a candidatos conservadores sólidos en las primarias legislativas.

Hegseth’s blunt remarks reinforced what had already been evident for years—Washington’s strategic priorities were shifting, and Europe could no longer rely on the USA to guarantee its security as it had during the Cold War and its aftermath. This shift, however, is not an abrupt departure but rather the culmination of a long-term recalibration of US foreign policy that has been years in the making.\n\nThe realignment of US strategic interests has been influenced by the rise of new threats, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Over the past two decades, China has emerged as a dominant global power, rapidly expanding its economic influence and military capabilities. Beijing’s assertiveness in the South China Sea, its modernization of the People’s Liberation Army, and its growing technological advancements have compelled the USA to refocus its military and diplomatic resources on countering China’s rise. This shift was first formally articulated during the Obama Administration’s “Pivot to Asia” policy, which sought to strengthen US alliances in the Indo-Pacific while reducing the overreliance on US military commitments in Europe. The Trump Administration further accelerated this trend by questioning NATO’s value and advocating for a redistribution of responsibilities among allies. The Biden Administration, despite its commitment to transatlantic ties, continued pressing European nations to increase their defence spending. Now, with Trump’s return to office in 2025, the de-prioritization of Europe appears to be taking full effect.\n\nEurope’s military capacity has long been a point of contention. While the European Union collectively possesses substantial economic resources, its ability to independently secure the continent remains questionable. Despite NATO’s continued presence, European nations have underinvested in their own defence for decades, relying instead on US military power. Even though European NATO allies and EU member states outspend Russia by a factor of four on defence, the continent remains highly dependent on the USA for logistics, intelligence, and nuclear deterrence.\n\nThe European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP), established in the late 1990s, aimed to provide the EU with autonomous military capabilities, but its effectiveness has been limited. Europe lacks a unified command structure, and individual nations often have conflicting strategic priorities. France and the United Kingdom, the two most militarily capable European nations, have led calls for a stronger continental defense posture, but progress has been slow. The reluctance of many European countries to meet NATO’s defense spending target of two percent of GDP has only reinforced Washington’s perception that Europe is not taking its security responsibilities seriously.\n\nIn light of these realities, Hegseth’s remarks in Brussels did not emerge in a vacuum. The belief that Europe is “freeloading” on American security commitments has been a persistent theme in the US foreign policy discourse. The post-Cold War era saw NATO shifting from a collective defense organization to a collective security entity, engaging in conflicts outside Europe, such as in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Libya. However, as the USA’s strategic focus turned toward the Indo-Pacific, maintaining extensive military commitments in Europe became increasingly difficult to justify. With China’s rise demanding greater attention and resources, the U.S. military presence in Europe has gradually diminished. The closure of American military bases across\n\nthe continent and the withdrawal of troops underscored this shift, signaling that Europe must now take primary responsibility for its own security.\n\nDomestic political and economic considerations within the United States have also played a significant role in this transformation. American public opinion has grown increasingly skeptical of the country’s role as the world’s security guarantor. The prolonged military engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan, coupled with mounting national debt, have led to a reassessment of foreign policy priorities. Successive administrations have faced growing pressure to prioritize domestic concerns over international commitments. Budgetary constraints have further driven the push to redistribute the burden of security among allies. With U.S. voters demanding a focus on economic stability, infrastructure, and social programs at home, policymakers have found it politically expedient to reduce defense expenditures abroad, particularly in regions where allies are perceived as capable of sharing the burden.\n\nThe Trump administration was instrumental in accelerating this shift. Trump’s “America First” doctrine questioned the foundational assumptions of U.S. alliances, arguing that NATO was an outdated and costly arrangement that unfairly benefited European nations. His administration repeatedly pressured NATO members to increase their contributions, warning that the USA could reconsider its commitments if European allies failed to meet their obligations. Trump’s rhetoric often strained relations with European leaders, who were deeply concerned about the potential unraveling of the transatlantic alliance. In the 2024 US presidential election, many European Union leaders openly supported Kamala Harris, hoping to prevent Trump’s return to power. However, with his re-election in 2024, Trump is now poised to take a more confrontational approach toward the EU, reinforcing his stance that Europe must assume greater responsibility for its security.\n\nAs the USA pivots away from Europe, the implications for transatlantic security are profound. European nations now face an urgent need to reassess their defence strategies and invest in autonomous security structures. The concept of European strategic autonomy, long championed by French President Emmanuel Macron, is gaining renewed momentum. Efforts to enhance Europe’s defence capabilities are underway, with discussions about a more integrated EU defence framework gaining traction. Recent reports indicate that Britain and France have been engaging in clandestine talks about deploying troops to Ukraine for post-war security, highlighting a growing recognition of Europe’s need to act independently of US support. Despite these developments, significant challenges remain. Europe’s fragmented defence landscape, political divisions, and the continued reliance on NATO’s infrastructure make the prospect of full strategic autonomy difficult to achieve in the short term. Moreover, the uncertainty surrounding US policy shifts with each administration complicates long-term planning for European security. While some nations, such as Poland and the Baltic states, advocate for stronger NATO commitments, others, like France and Germany, push for a more independent European defense identity. This divergence in strategic outlooks could hinder the continent’s ability to develop a cohesive security framework.\n\nThe slow but steady recalibration of US foreign policy underscores a fundamental reality: the era of unquestioned US commitment to European security is over. While NATO is unlikely to dissolve overnight, its role will inevitably evolve as Europe assumes greater responsibility for its\n\ndefense. The USA, now preoccupied with countering China and addressing domestic challenges, has made it clear that it expects its allies to step up. The transatlantic alliance must adapt to these new realities, forging a partnership based on shared responsibilities and mutual interests. As Europe navigates this transition, its ability to rise to the challenge will shape the future of global security in the years to come.","summary":"US Secretary of Defenqe Pete Hegseth left European defence ministers in shock during a meeting in Brussels on February 12, as he unequivocally stated that European security is no longer a primary focus of the USA.

Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco announced his candidacy at an event Monday in Riverside, California, about 50 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, in the 2026 race to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. \"As Californians we want leadership that actually cares about the cost of living …and leaders who will do something about it,\" Bianco said in his address, according to prepared excerpts. He emphasized that \"we want homes we can afford. We want air conditioning when it's hot, not rolling blackouts. We want water for the crops and animals that feed us. We want the opportunity to achieve the California Dream, not be prevented from it because of red tape and regulation from government. We want honesty and transparency from our elected officials. We want lower taxes and less government waste. We want sanity restored and common sense to prevail.\" TOP TRUMP OFFICIAL TEASES CALIFORNIA GUBERNATORIAL BID IF FORMER VP HARRIS RUNS Bianco, a vocal critic of Newsom and other state Democratic leaders when it comes to the issues of crime and punishment, was one of the leaders who helped push California's Proposition 36 ballot measure to a landslide victory in last November's elections. The measure, which took effect in December, mandates stiffer penalties and longer sentences in California for certain drug and theft crimes. \"I am running for Governor because our beautiful state – which I absolutely love – is heading down the wrong track and has been for years. Everyone knows it, except those sitting in the Sacramento echo chamber. For decades the party in complete control of our state government has tried the same failed ideas and implemented the same failed policies,\" Bianco argued, as he took aim at Newsom and the Democratic majorities in the state legislature. Bianco, who has worked in law enforcement for more than three decades, was first elected sheriff in 2018. He's been openly flirting with a 2026 gubernatorial run since at least last spring. It's been nearly two decades since a Republican won statewide office in heavily blue California. You have to go all the way back to former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's 2006 re-election victory. There has been plenty of speculation since former Vice President Kamala Harris' election defeat last November to Trump regarding her next political move, with the two potential options likely being launching a 2026 gubernatorial run in her home state of California or seeking the presidency again in 2028. MAJOR CALIFORNIA DEMOCRAT PREEDICTS FORMER VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS WOULD CLEAR GUBERNATORIAL FIELD Harris served as San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general and U.S. senator before becoming vice president. Sources in the former vice president's political orbit say no decisions have been made about any next steps. The Democrats' field for governor in the heavily blue-leaning state is already crowded. Among the more than half-dozen candidates already running for governor are Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, a Harris ally, and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Former Rep. Katie Porter, who unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic Senate nomination last year, has expressed interest in launching a campaign. Additionally, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, who served in Congress and as California attorney general before joining the Biden administration, is also seen as a potential contender. Former Fox News Channel host and conservative commentator Steve Hilton is considering a Republican run for California governor. And one of Trump's top aides is floating a potential bid for California governor if Harris also runs. Richard Grenell, a longtime Trump loyalist who is serving as U.S. envoy for special missions in the president's second administration, told reporters late last week, \"If Kamala Harris runs for governor, I believe that she has such baggage and hundreds of millions of dollars in educating the voters of how terrible she is, that it's a new day in California and that the Republican actually has a shot.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Grenell, who served as ambassador to Germany and as acting director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, considered a run for California governor during the 2021 recall election that Newsom eventually ended up easily winning, but he ultimately decided against launching a campaign. In California, unlike most other states, the top two finishers in a primary, regardless of party affiliation, advance to the general election.","summary":"Chad Bianco, a tough-on-crime Republican Sheriff in California&apos;s Riverside County and a 2024 Trump supporter, launches a 2026 campaign for governor in the race to succeed term-limited Gov.

We want Bianco!” Supporters carried signs saying “California is Home. You Don’t Have to Move” and “Only the sheriff can save us now.”\n\nBianco protesters gathered on a street corner, meanwhile, holding signs like “Under Bianco: Record In-Custody Deaths!” and “CA need a fair governor for all people, not Chad Bianco.”\n\nBefore Monday’s announcement, Bianco’s team sent an email touting his work “to stabilize the (Riverside County Sheriff’s Department’s) finances, increase staffing, and rebuild partnerships with other law enforcement agencies.”\n\n“Sheriff Bianco faces the reality of California’s failed public policies on a daily basis,” the email states. “He has been a strong voice for reforming state law to once again ensure public safety across California.”\n\nBianco “was a leader and vocal advocate for Proposition 36,” a successful 2024 ballot measure that tightened punishments for certain drug and theft offenses in what conservatives hailed as a rebuke of progressive criminal justice reform, the email added.\n\nThe gubernatorial race is for an open seat. Democrat Gavin Newsom, California’s governor since 2018, can’t run for reelection due to term limits.\n\nA number of candidates on the Democratic side have already announced for governor, including former state Senate President Toni Atkins, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former state Controller Betty Yee.\n\nThere’s also speculation that 2024 Democratic presidential nominee and former Vice President Kamala Harris and former Orange County Democratic Congressmember Katie Porter will run. Democrat and California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a rumored candidate, said this month he’s not entering the race.\n\nOn the GOP side, former Fox News host Steve Hilton is rumored to be eyeing a 2026 bid for governor. The gubernatorial election’s timing works out well for Bianco, whose term as sheriff doesn’t end until 2028 thanks to a state law that shifted California sheriffs’ elections to presidential election years.\n\nCalifornia’s top-two primary system sends the two biggest vote-getters, regardless of party, to the November general election. Usually, a Republican and a Democrat advance to November.\n\nFrom there, the odds heavily favor Democrats.\n\nCalifornia, a blue state, hasn’t elected a Republican to a statewide office since Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006 — and the 2018 and 2022 gubernatorial elections were called for Newsom minutes after polls closed.\n\nA 30-year department veteran, Bianco unseated incumbent Stan Sniff in 2018 to lead Riverside County’s largest law enforcement agency. He was reelected in 2022 with 61% of the vote.\n\nAs sheriff and county coroner, Bianco oversees a department with a roughly $1 billion budget and more than 4,000 employees. The department protects the public, runs five jails, conducts search-and-rescue operations and guards courtrooms in a county of roughly 2.5 million people that rivals New Jersey in square mileage.\n\nAs sheriff, Bianco has cultivated a reputation as a plain-spoken voice for law and order with an active social media presence who blames liberal judges and Sacramento’s Democratic leadership for coddling criminals and endangering law-abiding citizens.\n\nA frequent guest on Fox News and other conservative media, Bianco endeared himself to the right with his open defiance of, and unwillingness to enforce, Newsom’s COVID-19 mandates. He endorsed Republican Larry Elder, who ran in the failed 2021 Newsom recall election.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Bianco expressed skepticism about the COVID vaccine’s effectiveness. He has said he was “anti-vax for Chad” and brushed off concerns about COVID spreading in jails by saying: “If you are afraid to go to jail and catch the virus, then don’t go to jail, don’t break the law.”\n\nHe also didn’t require jail employees to be vaccinated, though unvaccinated staff had to be tested regularly for the virus. At least two of Bianco’s deputies, one assigned to the administrative office and another believed to have been infected by a jail inmate, died from COVID during the pandemic.\n\nBianco, who has enjoyed strong support from the sheriff’s deputies union, is an unabashed supporter of President Donald Trump. He endorsed the president’s campaign last year, quipping in a video: “It’s time we put a felon in the White House.”\n\nWhile Bianco’s Trump support will win over GOP voters, it could be a liability should he advance to the general election. Trump has historically been an unpopular figure in California.\n\nBianco also supports efforts to bolster border security. But on Feb. 6, Bianco posted an Instagram video in which he said his deputies “have not, are not and will not engage in any type of immigration enforcement. That is the sole responsibility of the federal government.”\n\nHe added he’d do everything possible “within the confines of the sanctuary state laws of California to cooperate with (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) to remove criminals from our jails” and that he’d fight to reform “an extremely dangerous sanctuary state law” restricting local law enforcement’s ability to work with federal immigration authorities.\n\nWhile California conservatives are eager to see Bianco run, his critics see an unaccountable loudmouth with a troublesome track record.\n\nIn 2014, Bianco admitted to being a dues-paying member of the Oath Keepers, a far-right militia whose leaders were convicted of charges stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol riot. Bianco in 2021 said he only paid for a year’s membership and forgot he belonged to the group.\n\nHis tenure as sheriff faces scrutiny, especially for a series of jail inmate deaths that have led to wrongful death lawsuits. Bianco’s department is currently the focus of a California attorney general civil rights investigation, a probe he said is politically motivated.\n\nCalifornia’s gubernatorial primary is June 2, 2026.","summary":"The outspoken Republican goes public with his plans Monday morning, Feb. 17, in downtown Riverside.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/02/17/riverside-county-sheriff-chad-bianco-announces-california-governor-run-in-2026/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RPE-L-BIANCO-0217-30-ASP.jpg?w=1024&h=729","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-17 19:21:41","author":"Jeff Horseman","authors":["Jeff Horseman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.124},{"id":291504798,"title":"Elon Musk sides with MAGA for a change, blasts CBS's 60 Minutes for lying about DOGE’s raid at the United States’ international aid agency","text":"Billionaire Elon Musk, siding with the anti-CBS crowd, took to social media late Sunday to accuse the network’s flagship investigative program of falsely reporting on DOGE’s raid at the US international aid agency, as per a report.

That is the potential for the constitutional crisis. But my view is that is not the phrase that Democrats should be screaming from the rooftops every day,\" Psaki said. NBC's Kristen Welker asked Psaki about the phrase, specifically in the context of the Department of Justice (DOJ) moving to dismiss the charges against Democratic New York City Mayor Eric Adams. \"It may be we’re on that road, but you need to be talking about how this is impacting your communities. The farmers I’ll reference, the people who rely on Medicaid, the veterans, the early childhood education kids who are relying on that. That is what we should be talking about. What Democrats should be talking about out there, because that is how you connect what is happening in Washington with communities in the country,\" she continued. PSAKI SAYS DEMOCRATS FAIL TO ADDRESS ‘WHAT VOTERS ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT,' NEED TO BREAK SOME S---' Democrats and pundits have sounded the alarm in the last few weeks, arguing that the president was creating a constitutional crisis through his executive action, and the legal challenges some of the orders have faced. Though some have pushed back on using the phrase, including MSNBC legal analyst Danny Cevallos, who also warned that the country was not yet in a constitutional crisis. \"The flurry of executive orders, the chaos, that I think doesn’t get us to crisis yet. It is irritating for the courts, it is challenging. It could lead to a serious problem if, as you said, they become too congested with dealing with these orders,\" he said. Psaki took issue with some other moves by members of her party, including former Vice President Kamala Harris' decision to campaign with former Rep. Liz Cheney, an anti-Trump Republican. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE \"I don't think closing the campaign with a message about fighting democracy with a former Republican member of Congress was the right strategy,\" Psaki told Jon Stewart on his \"The Weekly Show\" podcast on Friday. During the same show, Psaki took aim at the language of Democratic Party elites. \"I feel like when Democrats, and including people who are on television in a variety of ways, were saying things like, ‘Authoritarianism is under threat and democracy is on the ballot,’ I think we were speaking in a manner that was so academic and Ivory Tower, it wasn't talking about a lot of the things people actually care about,\" she said.

before allegedly having Elon Musk’s baby.","text":"Before Valentine’s Day, Ashley St Clair was notorious for her far-right political beliefs as a MAGA influencer espousing US President Donald Trump’s pro-America rhetoric on social media. \n\nToday, the 26-year-old is best known as Elon Musk’s fourth ‘baby mama’ after she sensationally claimed she shared a five-month old baby with the ‘First Buddy’ – referring to the Tesla billionaire’s friendship with Trump. \n\nAmid heightened scrutiny into St Clair’s life, it has been revealed that she is a political commentator and the author of conservative children books, as well as a longtime writer for the Babylon Bee – a right-wing version of satirical website The Onion.\n\nNow, a deep-dive into her personal X page (@stclairashley) that dates back to 2017 has revealed new details about her childhood – including growing up ‘dirt poor’ and eating ‘cornstarch meals’ – and past relationships. \n\nIt has also shone a light on how St. Clair’s social media presence has benefited since Musk, 53, took over the reigns from Jack Dorsey in April 2022. \n\nPrior to Musk’s takeover of the platform, St. Clair’s account was allegedly suspended on a number of occasions for violating the platform’s rules regarding ‘hateful content’ in response to tweets deemed racist, fatphobic, and transphobic. \n\nThe pro-life, pro-guns campaigner has routinely declared there are ‘only two genders’ and criticised the body positivity movement for ‘promoting obesity’ in posts on the micro-blogging platform. \n\nHere, FEMAIL revisits ‘MAGA mama’ St. Clair’s X account in the years leading up to her affair with the company’s CEO – and the world’s richest man – Musk: \n\nSt Clair, who is Jewish, first gave her Twitter followers rare insight into her upbringing in a 2019 tweet, where she recalled how her mother went ‘from feeding a family of four on $0.60 a day, eating cornstarch and water & drinking powdered milk to being a top business leader’.\n\nShe has also claimed that her parents got divorced when she was a child, and that her mother and siblings were pushed into poverty and subsisted on ‘food stamps’ after her father left. \n\nAshley has a younger brother and an older sister whom she described as her ‘best friend, human diary and the best gnocchi maker’ in a tribute Instagram post on the occasion of her sibling’s birthday. \n\nIn a separate X post from five years ago, Ashley revealed her family grew up so poor that ‘at times, we didn’t have running water’. \n\n‘The best gifts my mom could get us were from the Dollar Tree,’ she wrote in a message shared on November 4, 2019. \n\nToday, St Clair lives in a swanky Manhattan apartment near City Hall, costing an estimated $12,000 to $15,000 per month.\n\nOne resident of the exclusive condo tower, which has been home to VIPs and celebrities, said St Clair was the first person he knew to get a Tesla Cybertruck – and he wondered how the young influencer afforded it.\n\nNeighbors also said St Clair was apparently living as a single mother, but has a full-time nanny looking after her two children: Musk’s alleged baby and a toddler from her previous relationship.\n\nMusk has at least 12 other children with three women: Justine Wilson, Claire Elise Boucher AKA Grimes, and Shivon Zilis.\n\nBefore allegedly welcoming her love child with Musk five months ago, St Clair fell pregnant in 2021 before giving birth to her firstborn, a son, who she shares with ex-boyfriend and New York based chiropractor Dr Johnny Alexander. \n\nShe first made mention of a boyfriend – who was apparently a regular fixture of her Instagram account – in 2019.\n\nIt appears Ashley was still in a long-term relationship in 2020, when the pro-gun campaigner told her followers he ‘surprised me with a new Macbook and a bulletproof vest’ for Christmas.\n\nThe following year, Ashley told her followers that her boyfriend had ‘lost four patients that are Facebook employees’ because of her social media activity. \n\nIt appears some of Dr Alexander’s patients, however, approved of St Clair; today, she remains friends with disgraced ex-congressman George Santos, who also appeared on a podcast with him this month. \n\nAfter St Clair’s baby bombshell, Santos rallied to her side on X, posting that he would defend her from anyone trying to ‘exploit or expose’ her.\n\n‘I’ll come out of my hiatus for this! If anyone so much tries to exploit or expose you and/or your child I’ll be there to remind them what a bad idea that was,’ he wrote on February 15. \n\n‘I admire your strength and fight to protect your kids. You are a phenomenal mother and I know that first hand… nothing will change and you are very much in control now. Love you my friend!’\n\nAshley began posting from her @stclairashley handle on Twitter in October 2018. \n\nIt appears that several of her earliest tweets were reported and subsequently deleted, with Ashley also claiming that ‘Twitter keeps banning me’. \n\n‘Twitter thinks science is hate speech,’ Ashley tweeted on December 29, 2018, when a fellow user asked her the ‘reason for ban’ in response to a now-scrubbed post.\n\n‘Apparently science is hateful content,’ she said in an earlier tweet from the same day.\n\nThis time, she shared screenshots of a Twitter warning for violating the platform’s rules against ‘hateful conduct’.\n\nThe tweet that was determined to be in breach of Twitter’s regulations read: ‘It’s called gender dysphoria and it’s – no matter what the left says, a mental disorder.’\n\nOn Christmas Eve that year, Ashley tweeted: ‘If you’re reading this, go to the gym fatty.’\n\nThe anti-abortion campaigner also called on then-President hopeful Kamala Harris to ‘defund Planned Parenthood’ under a post about her plans to implement a gun safety bill.\n\n‘I’ve seen too many autopsy photos and hugged too many mothers of homicide victims to not take action,’ Harris wrote.\n\n‘If you actually cared about children being murdered, you’d defund Planned Parenthood which has taken the lives of more children than guns ever have,’ Ashley fired back.\n\nOver the next four years, she continued to take aim at ‘deranged liberals’ Pride Parades, the casting of a black actress as The Little Mermaid, and the feminist movement. \n\nIn one instance, she criticised ‘feminists who support sex work and porn’ while stating that ‘porn addiction is one of the most overlooked epidemics’.\n\nLater that year, the anti-vaxxer and anti-masker announced she was pregnant while criticising ‘idiots telling me to use myself and my child as test subjects’ for the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nOn 28 October 2021, she tweeted: ‘The closer I get to labour, the closer I get to sucker punching anybody who claims men can get pregnant or give birth.’\n\nShortly after Ashley went public with her Musk bombshell, Dr Alexander – whose bio reads ‘Father. New Yorker’ – appeared to comment on his relationship status, writing: ‘For the record – I have never been married, I’ve never even been engaged.\n\n ‘I’m just a really great father to an amazing little boy.’\n\nIn a 2021 interview with the New York Post, St Clair railed against liberal attitudes towards gender identity while talking about her son, now three. \n\n‘I am going to have a little boy in November, and it’s scary to think he could come home and say, ‘My friends all identify as something else and that’s how I feel’ and have my son crying because he’s not put on hormone replacement therapy,’ she told the newspaper. \n\nSt Clair and Musk began a very public display of flirtation on his social media website in 2023. \n\nThey had been messaging each other in public since May 2023 with risqué jokes about ‘d*** pics’, innuendo-laden references to ‘pulling out’, ‘how babies are made’ and ‘horny jail’.\n\nHe wished her happy birthday last July, she sent him heart emojis, he sent her a lengthy list of book suggestions and told her ‘this is the absolute best time in history to have kids!’\n\nFollowing the alleged birth of her and Musk’s baby, she continued her meteoric rise in MAGA circles, including showing up at Donald Trump’s election night party at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nSt Clair shared photos on X of herself at Trump’s estate congressman Matt Gaetz’s wife Ginger and GOP spokeswoman Elizabeth Pipko.\n\nShe has also been pictured with Vivek Ramaswamy and Trump’s FBI Director pick Kash Patel.\n\nSt Clair also enjoys a friendship with Lynne Patton, President Trump’s Deputy Assistant and Director of Minority Outreach. \n\nAlongside a photo of the pair, taken at Trump’s inauguration ceremony, she wrote: ‘Ready for the Golden Age of America’. \n\nSt. Clair declared the ‘Bimbo revolution is beginning’ in a separate post, featuring a photo of her posing with Canadian alt-right YouTuber and documentary filmmaker Lauren Cherie Southern. \n\nOther members of her inner circle appear to include Eva Vlaardingerbroek, a Dutch right-wing commentator, and Candace Owens – who she was photographed with in 2020.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBefore Valentine&#8217;s Day, Ashley St Clair was notorious for her far-right political&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Exploring Ashley St Clair&#8217;s life before allegedly having Elon Musk&#8217;s baby. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/exploring-ashley-st-clairs-life-before-allegedly-having-elon-musks-baby/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/17/14/95293451-14405547-Before_Valentine_s_Day_Ashley_St_Clair_was_notorious_for_her_far-a-9_1739800835863.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-17 15:42:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.268},{"id":291445116,"title":"Kamala Harris to Receive Chairman’s Award at 2025 NAACP Image Awards","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris is set to receive the Chairman’s Award at this weekend’s 56th NAACP Image Awards.\n\nThe award goes to individuals who “excel in public service and leverage their unique platforms to ignite and drive meaningful change,” per the NAACP.

Although the audience cheered her on and gave her a standing ovation, her address, which was meant to motivate the actors and workers behind the scenes, has generated the greatest internet criticism.\n\n‘In times when we’re dealing with so much in the world, um, we have to find those moments that are about joy and, and, and, shining, you know, as we say, shining a light in moments of darkness,’ she said addressing the cast and crew of A Wonderful World. ‘When we think about these moments where we see things that are being taken, but also let’s see it, you know, nature abhors a vacuum.\n\nKamala Harris continues her ‘word salad’ nonsense at Broadway https://t.co/ghyTxFTIQZ\n— Carl “Kalle” Svensson (@KalleKeps) February 17, 2025\n\n‘Where there’s a vacancy, let’s fill it.

These things all co-exist, but I believe we fight for something not against.’ The cast and crew applauded her visit and nodded, but social media critics have since questioned what she was actually attempting to say.\n\n‘The saddest part is hearing the people agreeing with her like they were mesmerized by what she was “saying,” a critic said. ‘The woman is completely incapable of giving a coherent statement.

Would you pay to hear her monologues?’ ‘Kamala Harris hit Broadway and, of course, served up her signature word salad. A friendly reminder of what we dodged in the White House.’\n\nOn TikTok, cast member Wes Barnes posted a brief clip of the exchange and complimented the former vice president for giving her time freely. He said: ‘Not only did she take the time to inspire us and speak life into us, but she was so gracious with her time as well. ‘All I wanted was a photo. Not only did I get my photo… I got all of this. There is still hope. There’s still work to be done. We can’t give up or in.’\n\nBarnes’ comment area was inundated with supporters who bemoaned “what could have been” if Harris had won the presidential election. President Trump defeated her in both the electoral vote and the popular vote. One Harris admirer remarked, “Her presence is commanding yet gentle.”\n\nThe ‘word salad’ responses Harris gave to direct questions during her presidential campaign drew constant criticism. Republicans and President Trump frequently focused on the fact that she frequently overcomplicated her responses, diluting her intended response or message.\n\nShe encouraged her followers to be optimistic in the face of her heartbreaking 2024 defeat by hosting a holiday reception for them over the Christmas season. In a speech commemorating the occasion, Harris exhorted her followers to resist giving in to discouragement, disillusionment, and despair.\n\nListening to Kamala’s latest comical word-salad gibberish tonight, I honestly don’t know why anyone would vote for her.. millions will just because she’s the Democrat nominee, but jeez – there is nothing there.

Jackson, John Lewis, Ruby Dee, Danny Glover, Rev. James Lawson, Tyler Perry, then-Sen. Barack Obama, Congressman Bennie G. Thompson and Rep. Maxine Waters among others, is given to individuals who excel in public service and leverage their unique platforms to ignite and drive meaningful change.\n\n“Vice President Kamala Harris is more than a leader — she is a force of change, driven by an unwavering passion to shape a brighter, more equitable future. It is with great honor that we present her with the Chairman’s Award at this year’s NAACP Image Awards, celebrating her relentless dedication to justice, equality, and the betterment of our society,” said Leon W. Russell, Chair, NAACP National Board of Directors. “Her legacy is built on courage, compassion, and a profound commitment to uplifting those who need it most. Her tireless advocacy for the most vulnerable among us has made her a beacon of hope and progress.”\n\nHarris, formerly California’s attorney general and senator, made history as the first woman, Black American and South Asian American elected U.S. Vice President. In 2024, she became the first Black and South Asian woman nominated for president by a major party.\n\n“Vice President Harris embodies the power, grace, and unyielding courage that Black women have long brought to the heart of the United States,” said Derrick Johnson, NAACP president and CEO. “With bold determination, Vice President Harris fights for justice, amplifies the voices of the marginalized, and stands as a beacon of hope. She embodies the resilience and brilliance of Black women, uplifting their legacy as the driving force behind change in this country. VP Harris reminds us all that when Black women lead, the entire nation rises.”\n\nHarris joins a list of honorees that includes Dave Chappelle, who will receive the President’s Award, at Saturday’s Image Awards, which takes place at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium beginning at 8 p.m. ET/PT and airing live on BET and CBS.\n\nGoing into the annual awards, which honors the best in Black achievement across entertainment, Netflix’s The Piano Lesson has a leading 14 nominations, while the marquee Entertainer of the Year category features nominees Cynthia Erivo, Keke Palmer, Kevin Hart, Kendrick Lamar and Shannon Sharpe.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe NAACP and BET said Monday that Vice President and 2024 Democratic&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris Selected for Chairman’s Award at NAACP Image Awards first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/kamala-harris-selected-for-chairmans-award-at-naacp-image-awards/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-To-Receive-This-Years-Chairmans.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-17 14:26:59","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.904},{"id":291534196,"title":"Former VP Kamala Harris to Accept Chairman’s Award on 2025 NAACP Image Awards","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris will make her first major appearance since leaving office on Jan. 20 to accept the Chairman’s Award during the 56th NAACP Image Awards on Saturday, Feb. 22. The show will air live from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Pasadena, Calif., at 8 p.m. ET/PT on BET and CBS. This year, the broadcast will be extended 30 minutes to 2.5 hours.\n\n The Chairman’s Award honors individuals who “excel in public service and leverage their unique platforms to ignite and drive meaningful change.” Past honorees include then-Sen. Barack Obama (2005), former VP Al Gore in tandem with Kenyan social, environmental and political activist Wangari Waathati, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, the late Rep. John Lewis, Rev. James Lawson, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, Rep. Maxine Waters and former Surgeon General Regina Benjamin.\n\n Previously announced special award recipients at this year’s NAACP Image Awards are comedian Dave Chappelle (President’s Award) and The Wayans Family (NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame).\n\n Harris made history as the first woman, Black person and South Asian person to become vice president. She previously served as U.S. Senator and California Attorney General. In 2024, she became the first Black and South Asian woman nominated for president by a major party, receiving more than 75 million votes in what BET reminds us was “the shortest modern general election campaign.” President Biden was fully expected to be the Democratic nominee until a shaky debate performance on June 27 caused many, even in his own party, to call for a new nominee. Biden withdrew on July 21. Harris was voted the party’s nominee by delegates on Aug. 5, just three months before Election Day.\n\n “Vice President Kamala Harris is more than a leader – she is a force of change, driven by an unwavering passion to shape a brighter, more equitable future,” Leon W. Russell, chair, NAACP national board of directors said in a statement. “… Her legacy is built on courage, compassion, and a profound commitment to uplifting those who need it most. Her tireless advocacy for the most vulnerable among us has made her a beacon of hope and progress.”\n\n “Vice President Harris is deeply deserving of the NAACP Chairman’s awards for both her historic accomplishments and her incredible legacy of service to America and our community,” added Scott Mills, president and CEO of BET Media Group. “… Her unwavering commitment to justice, equity and progress has inspired millions, and her journey is a powerful testament to that which can be achieved through resilience, strength and brilliance. \n\n “Vice President Harris embodies the power, grace and unyielding courage that Black women have long brought to the heart of the United States,” said Derrick Johnson, NAACP President and CEO. “With bold determination, Vice President Harris fights for justice, amplifies the voices of the marginalized and stands as a beacon of hope.

They engaged in deliberate deception to interfere with the latest election. They deserve a long prison sentence.”\n\n“Elon Musk posted these two tweets on the same day,” the handle RepublicansAgainstTrump posted to X.\n\n“Unreal,” commented Ron Filipkowski.\n\nEarlier this month, CBS’ “60 Minutes” posted online the unedited transcripts of its October interview with Kamala Harris that sparked a lawsuit by Trump, saying that they proved its broadcast was not “doctored or deceitful.”\n\nThat’s what Trump contended in a $10 billion lawsuit he filed against the network in November, reportedly the subject of ongoing settlement talks.\n\nIn a separate track, the Federal Communications Commission recently called for CBS to send transcripts and clips of the interview, which CBS did before making them public. The interview with the Democratic presidential candidate, portions of which were aired on “60 Minutes” and “Face the Nation,” attracted attention because clips showed her giving different answers to a question about Israel that was posed by correspondent Bill Whitaker.\n\nMusk made a rare public appearance at the White House last week to defend the swift and extensive cuts he’s pushing across the federal government while acknowledging there have been mistakes and will be more.\n\nMusk stood next to the Resolute Desk with his young son as Trump praised Musk’s work with his Department of Government Efficiency, saying they’ve found “shocking” evidence of wasteful spending. The Republican president signed an executive order to expand Musk’s influence and continue downsizing the federal workforce.\n\nDespite concerns that he’s amassing unaccountable power with little transparency, Musk described himself as an open book as he took questions from reporters for the first time since joining the Trump administration as a special government employee. He joked that the scrutiny over his sprawling influence over federal agencies was like a “daily proctology exam.”\n\nMusk spent hundreds of millions of dollars to help get Trump elected.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"Musk spent hundreds of millions of dollars to help get Trump elected.","url":"https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/02/trump-henchman-wants-a-long-prison-sentence-for-popular-investigative-tv-show.html","image":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/FKKK2ZE2DVFDDPRM2KPZ6CFBUQ.jpg?auth=8571ce7242bc34c23b565cec1ab2d35b9b2c82c2db060e628304142f83c66295&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-17 13:51:30","author":"Matt Arco","authors":["Matt Arco"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.026},{"id":291406170,"title":"After triumphant return to White House, Trump is still fixated on Biden: ‘It’s his fault’","text":"Washington CNN — \nJoe Biden left the White House nearly a month ago, but he’s never far from Donald Trump’s mind.\nThe former president has been a recurring punchline – and punching bag – in nearly every appearance Trump has made since returning to power. With Republicans in full control of Washington, Trump is forever in search of a foil and Biden tops the list.\n“Much of this stuff is because of Biden,” Trump said last week in the Oval Office, referring to federal employees being allowed to telework. “It’s his fault.”\nFor Trump, the buck stops with Biden – not with him. It’s a new wrinkle to the sign that sat on Harry Truman’s desk, “The Buck Stops Here,” a phrase has been a guiding principle of most presidents ever since.\nThe list of challenges that Trump and his team have blamed on Biden is long: the high price of eggs, the crash of an airliner in the Potomac River, mishandled disaster relief from FEMA, the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, the proliferation of terrorists in Somalia, expanding US trade deficits, a deterioration of relations with Beijing.\n“I think Biden is incompetent,” Trump said, calling out his predecessor eight times on Thursday as he blamed him for the Russia-Ukraine war. “I think when he said that they could join NATO, I thought that was a very stupid thing to say.”\nTrump’s favorite contrast\nWhile the problems of every presidency are inextricably linked, Biden’s holds an unusual place in history, with his administration sandwiched between Trump’s first and second terms. When Biden took office, he made a point of not mentioning Trump by name, a practice that he dropped as time wore on.\nFor years, Biden has occupied a singular place in Trump’s mind, aides say, a forever rival whom he never defeated at the ballot box. Trump revels in using Biden as a metaphor for a stark contrast in style and substance.\nAs Trump settles into his routine of signing executive actions, while fielding a wide range of questions from reporters nearly every day, he called out his predecessor dozens of times last week over Ukraine, illegal immigration and his distaste for paper straws.\n“This was all led by Biden and the group of stupid people,” Trump said, blasting Biden’s border policies. He soon moved onto US aid to Ukraine, saying: “Biden gives it because he’s not a smart individual.”\nNever mind that Trump made history and became the 47th president by defeating Kamala Harris. He seldom mentions her by name, even as he frequently ticks through the battleground states he carried and the popular vote he won in November.\nInstead, Trump returns to the Biden well again and again.\n“We’ve done more in two weeks than Biden’s done in five, six years,” Trump declared one afternoon as he sat behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, where Biden – who was president for four years – left a message to wish his successor well, writing: “May God bless you and guide you.”\nU.S. President Donald Trump holds former United States President Joe Biden's letter on the day he signs executive orders for January 6 defendants in the Oval Office at the White House on Inauguration Day in Washington, U.S., January 20, 2025.

He ended with his signature slogan, “Make America Great Again.”\nBiden stays quiet\nFor his part, Biden has settled into his post-presidency life back in Delaware.\nHe has occasionally spoken to longtime friends and allies about Trump, people familiar with the conversations say, often expressing a sense of dismay and astonishment at any given day’s whirlwind turn of events. If he accepts any blame for his role in Trump’s return, he has not said so, even in private.\nSeveral former Biden advisers said they preferred not to speak openly about Trump’s frequent disparagements of their former boss. A spokesperson for Biden declined to comment.\nTim Naftali, a presidential historian and former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, said Trump’s obsession with Biden stands out in a long line of relationships from one American leader to the next.\n“After having won the popular vote and enjoying much better approval ratings in his first few weeks, it’s remarkable that he cares,” said Naftali, who is also a CNN contributor. “He refers to President Biden more often than Democrats do.”\nHe added: “Talking about Biden is a way to mobilize his base and he just can’t get away from it.”\nWhen Trump first became president eight years ago, he called out his vanquished rival, Hillary Clinton, over and over and adopted a similar attitude toward his then-predecessor Barack Obama, who departed office with a much higher approval rating than Biden. Their acrimony had dated back years, to when Trump falsely claimed Obama was born outside the United States.\nAt the time, the enmity was taken as a major breach in presidential history. Almost always, presidents of both parties have tried to at least maintain the appearance of collegiality with their predecessors, even when they secretly despised them and delivered any public critiques in subtler ways.\nNot so with Trump, who wore his disdain on his sleeve. He accused Obama of surveilling him in Trump Tower, in addition to a wide array of other faults. He had little nice to say about his Republican predecessors, either, including George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, whom he accused of warmongering.\nIn Biden, Trump has a far less popular foil than he did with Obama.\nThe 46th president departed office with historically low approval ratings and was widely criticized, even by Democrats, for failing to step aside sooner to allow Harris or another nominee to mount a fulsome campaign to stop Trump.\nYet at one point, Trump seemed to have some sympathy for Biden’s predicament. He bemoaned what he described as an undignified and cruel process of shoving aside the president from the Democratic ticket.\n“The presidency was taken away from Joe Biden, and I’m no Biden fan,” he said a few weeks after Biden stepped aside.\nThe pleasantries continued during a meeting a week after the November election, when Trump and Biden met for nearly two hours to discuss a peaceful transition of power.\n“It will be as smooth as it can get,” Trump said, “and I very much appreciate that, Joe.”\nYet that tone was short-lived.\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris arrive during the 60th Presidential Inauguration in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Monday, Jan. 20, 2025.

Otherwise, he warned, \"all hell is going to break loose.\"\n\n\"They'll find out what I mean. Saturday at 12,\" Trump declared. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in lockstep with the president, hinted the entire deal could collapse.\n\nHamas ended up releasing the three hostages as originally planned. Netanyahu freed scores of Palestinian prisoners in return, and Trump's noon deadline came and went with no further hostage releases.\n\nThe drama was the latest glimpse of Trump's Mideast diplomacy — a world of big declarations, chaotic unpredictability and mixed results.\n\nIn some cases, this approach has yielded great dividends — most notably the 2020 Abraham Accords between Israel and four Arab countries. But it also has threatened to destabilize an already unstable region and shown little success resolving Israel's decades-old conflict with the Palestinians.\n\nHere are a few takeaways from Trump's first month in office:\n\nA surprise Gaza proposal\n\nTrump has built his career on tough talk, threats and ultimatums — along with surprises that supporters say are meant to shake up the status quo.\n\nTrump's boldest and most controversial plan so far has been his call for all of Gaza's 2 million people to be removed from the territory, for the U.S. to then take \"ownership\" and then to oversee a yearslong reconstruction process. The Palestinians, he says, would not be allowed to return — a nightmare for a people whose core grievance is the mass displacement they suffered during Israel's creation 76 years ago. The Palestinians have rejected the plan out of hand.\n\nTrump has not said how this plan would work, where Palestinians would go, who would take them in or who would pay. Human rights groups and international law experts believe the plan would amount to a war crime.\n\nIt is not clear whether the plan is a serious proposal or an attempt to shock the region's players into returning to the negotiating table. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday the plan \"is right on the dot. It's the right plan.\"\n\nIsraelis love him\n\nIf Israel were part of the United States, it would be a bright red state when it comes to presidential politics. Opinion polls last November showed Israelis overwhelmingly believed Trump would be better for their country than Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nThat support has shown no signs of softening. Early this month, Netanyahu was warmly received as the first foreign leader to visit the White House, where Trump unveiled his plan for Gaza.\n\nWhile the idea of a mass transfer of Palestinians was once an idea of Israel's most radical ultranationalist fringe, Netanyahu has warmly embraced it since it was floated by Trump.\n\nSince then, the Israelis appear to be taking their cues from Trump. Netanyahu repeatedly consulted with the Americans during last week's standoff.\n\nHosting U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Netanyahu once again called Trump \"the greatest friend that Israel has ever had\" in the White House.\n\nHe said the two nations stood \"shoulder to shoulder\" in confronting archenemy Iran and that he was working in \"full cooperation\" with Trump on a postwar plan for Gaza. He even adopted Trump's language in threatening to open \"the gates of hell\" on Hamas if remaining hostages aren't released. Yet he has continued with ceasefire talks at the prodding of the Americans.\n\nAmerica's closest Arab allies have rejected Trump's plans, which pose an existential threat to the Palestinian cause and their own stability. But some also face the threat of Trump cutting off badly needed aid.\n\nKing Abdullah II of Jordan, one of Trump's hoped-for destinations for uprooted Palestinians, gently refused the plan during his own White House visit last week.\n\nEgypt, which borders Gaza and has been named as another potential landing spot for displaced Palestinians, has also ruled it out.\n\nA key test for Trump is Rubio's visit to Saudi Arabia on Monday.\n\nTrump and Netanyahu have made clear they would like to see the establishment of full diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut the Saudis oppose the mass transfer of Palestinians out of Gaza and want a clear pathway for Palestinian independence as part of any normalization deal with Israel. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's accusations that Israel committed \"genocide\" in Gaza could also complicate the talks.\n\nAfter the war\n\nTrump's postwar plan has sent shockwaves across the region.\n\nEndorsing the forced expulsion of millions of Palestinians would be risky for U.S. allies.\n\nThe populations of countries like the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt are deeply sympathetic to the Palestinian people and going along with such a plan could trigger domestic unrest. Egypt has warned it could endanger its peace agreement with Israel — a cornerstone of regional stability for nearly half a century.\n\nAt the same time, Trump's plan appears to have bred a sense of urgency. Egypt says it is now working on its own postwar plan for Gaza and is set to host an Arab summit later this month.\n\nRubio has said that if others don't like the American ideas, they should offer an alternative. \"It may have shocked and surprised many, but what cannot continue is the same cycle where we repeat over and over again and wind up in the exact same place,\" he said.\n\nFrom the Arabs' perspective, what has been tried and failed for decades is America's unquestioning support for Israel as it occupies lands the Palestinians want for a future state, expands settlements and tries to impose a military solution on the conflict — all of which is set to accelerate under Trump.\n\nMore uncertainty ahead\n\nTrump's Mideast team, led by envoy Steve Witkoff, played a key role in securing the current six-week ceasefire, even before taking office.\n\nThe current phase of the ceasefire is set to expire in two weeks, and Netanyahu has sent mixed signals about what happens next.\n\nNetanyahu has repeatedly threatened to resume the war, as demanded by the hard-line partners in his governing coalition.\n\nBut he also has committed to continuing negotiations on a second stage that could ultimately end the war.\n\nIt's impossible to say which path he and his unpredictable friend in the White House will choose.","summary":"When Hamas threatened to call off the planned release of three Israeli hostages last week, U.S. President Donald Trump stepped into the picture with an unexpected ultimatum.\n\n\n\n     Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump called on Hamas to release all of the more than 70 hostages it is holding by noon on Saturday.

And it doesn’t mean we don’t see the beauty in everything. These things all co-exist, but I believe we fight for something, not against something.”\n\nDetractors swiftly mocked Harris for her wordy, roundabout way of delivering a message.\n\n“Kamala Harris hit Broadway and, of course, served up her signature word salad. A friendly reminder of what we dodged in the White House,” one person wrote alongside a clip of the speech.\n\nAnother chimed in: “Literally, the only thing worse than listening to this gobbledygook, is the folks around her nodding and clapping, as if she made sense.”\n\n“How are they not all rolling their eyes at her inane chatter?!” a third questioned. \n\nAnother commentator compared her words to speaking with a drunken relative, writing, “Drunk auntie and her entourage of people that get paid to go ‘Mmmm.'” \n\nOthers simply shared gifs of someone mixing up a salad — a reference to Harris’ trademark “word salad” speeches. \n\nHarris, 60, who ran in place of age-addled President Biden at the last minute but lost to Donald Trump, warned she would not “go quietly into the night” after leaving office in January. \n\nThe Democrat, the country’s first female Vice President, has not shared specifics about her next plans, though she is rumored to be considering a run for political office again, including as governor of California. \n\nThe state’s current leader, Gavin Newsom, is term-limited.","summary":"Critics mocked former Vice President Kamala Harris for serving up her signature \"word salad\" while attempting to deliver an inspirational speech to the cast of Broadway's \"A Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/17/us-news/kamala-harris-mocked-for-rambling-speech-at-louis-armstrong-broadway-show/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/98722153.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-17 12:25:27","author":"Isabel Keane","authors":["Isabel Keane"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.061},{"id":291373168,"title":"Trump's Golden Opportunity to Stand Up for Human Rights | Opinion","text":"\"Kamala Harris did nothing as 120,000 Armenian Christians were horrifically persecuted and forcibly displaced in Artsakh. Christians around the world will not be safe if Kamala Harris is President of the United States. When I am President, I will protect persecuted Christians, I will work to stop the violence and ethnic cleansing, and we will restore peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\"This statement was made by Donald Trump on his Truth Social account last October during the heat of the U.S. presidential campaign. It was Trump's attempt to curry favor with evangelicals while also distinguishing his foreign policy bona fides with the Biden/Harris administration. It also showed a side of him that the public rarely sees. It showed that the president has empathy and cares. And unlike other statements made by Trump which can often defy logic and morality, his assessment of what is happening to the Armenian people is unequivocally true.The country of Azerbaijan has spent the last four years trying to wipe out Armenia and its existence in the South Caucasus. It started in the fall of 2020, when it launched an illegal and unprovoked war against Armenia over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh (Artsakh) and ended when it ethnically cleansed more than 120,000 Armenians from the region, making it the largest displacement of Armenians since the Armenian genocide of 1915. Since taking over the territory, Azerbaijan has embarked on an ongoing campaign of cultural erasure of Armenian churches, monasteries, khachkars (cross-stoned monuments), and other historical sites that have stood for thousands of years.Azerbaijan has also tried to bully and threaten its way into disingenuous peace deals with Armenia while plotting with Turkey, a key ally, in taking sovereign lands away from Armenia including the Zangezur Corridor, a vital trade route located between the two countries.Even more alarming has been the type of language coming from Baku. In recent speeches, Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev falsely claimed that Armenia is their historical land, while referring to Armenia as \"Western Azerbaijan.\"This follows a troubling pattern of hateful rhetoric in which the petro-dictator has made similar revanchist arguments and has even said that Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, belongs to Azerbaijan.We have seen this hate carried out through the mistreatment and torture of Armenian POWs and blatant execution of captured Armenian soldiers.And earlier this year, Azerbaijan began its sham trials of Armenian political prisoners, including philanthropist and former state minister of Nagorno-Karabakh Ruben Vardanyan, despite pleas of their innocence from human rights activists and legal scholars.These crimes and basic violations of human rights all took place on former President Joe Biden's watch. He dropped the ball. For a president who came into office claiming that human rights would be at the crux of his foreign policy, Biden's inability to hold Azerbaijan responsible for its war crimes and atrocities will be a stain on his legacy. In many ways, his silence and apathy gave Azerbaijan the green light to act with impunity.That is why President Trump has a unique opportunity to do what President Biden failed to do—hold Azerbaijan accountable.For starters, he can uphold Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act, which bans any kind of foreign aid to the Azerbaijani government, something Biden waived consistently during his administration despite ongoing Azeri aggression.He can continue U.S. recognition of the Armenian genocide, which formally acknowledges the first genocide of the 20th century, when more than 1.5 million Armenians as well as Assyrians, Greeks, and others were systemically exterminated by the Ottomans, an event Turkey and Azerbaijan still deny to this day.He can demand the immediate release of all Armenian political prisoners who have been illegally and unjustly held without due process as well as the unconditional release of all Armenian POWs who currently sit in Azeri jails.Trump can bring more transparency and personal involvement into the peace-making process, which up until now has been a charade and essentially ignored by the White House.He can pressure Azerbaijan to stop its religious persecution of Armenian antiquities and holy sites in Artsakh as well as rebuke all forms of historical revisionism that can be used as a pretext for future attacks on Armenian sovereignty.He can demand the removal of Azerbaijani forces from Armenia and the return of Armenians to Artsakh.President Trump said that he wants to be a peacemaker and stop all wars during his second administration. He can begin by honoring his campaign promise to hold Azerbaijan accountable and stop the violence directed toward the Armenian people. There can be no peace without accountability.

I’m not a Trumper. Whatever he says, I take it with a grain of salt.” \n\nHe added: “I was at the Obama inauguration, the Biden inauguration, and there was no way I would have gone to this one. I didn’t even watch it. And I’ll be glad when the next four years are up.”\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Robinson expressed his admiration of Martin Luther King, who Trump bizarrely compared himself to in 2020. \n\n“He was a regal man,” the Miracles frontman said of the civil rights leader. “Even if you didn’t know who he was you would respect him, simply through his presence.” \n\nRobinson added: “He came to Motown and said, ‘I want to record a speech here, because you guys are doing with music what I’m trying to legislate. You’re bringing the races together.’ \n\n“The Miracles played down south when there would be a rope in the centre of the hall – white people on one side, black people on the other – and by the end of the concert they would all be dancing together. Martin Luther King recognised the power the music had.”\n\nBack in October last year, Robinson urged American voters to support Kamala Harris in the presidential election. “I'm not a Democrat or a Republican, I'm an American and I love my country,” he said. \n\n“I’ve been blessed to have a job that's afforded me the chance to go all over the world and as far as i'm concerned the United States of America is the greatest place on earth.” \n\nHe continued: “I’ve never felt the need to campaign publicly until now. This is the most important election of my lifetime and as far as I’m concerned it’s a choice between good and evil.” \n\n“I really don’t understand how any person of colour or any woman could find it in their hearts to vote for Donald Trump. He’s a spoilt brat child who retaliates against anyone who opposes him on any issue.” \n\nRobinson added: “He thinks he’s better than you. He thinks he’s slicker than you. That he can stand up and lie in your face and then turn right around and say he didn’t do it…I hope you all wake up and vote.”","summary":"‘I’ll be glad when the next four years are up,’ singer said","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/smokey-robinson-donald-trump-opinion-b2699454.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/17/10/Smokey-Robinson-Donald-Trump.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ifVcPamw-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-17 11:02:21","author":"Lydia Spencer-Elliott","authors":["Lydia Spencer-Elliott"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.085},{"id":291387118,"title":"Actor who played JD Vance in Hillbilly Elegy condemns stars who get political","text":"The actor who portrayed JD Vance in the Oscar-nominated film Hillbilly Elegy before the latter man became the vice-president of the US has said his fellow thespians should “shut the fuck up” rather than express their political opinions.\n\nGabriel Basso – now starring in the hit Netflix series The Night Agent – made those comments on a recent episode of the Great Company podcast, cutting a stark contrast with his director on Hillbelly Elegy, Ron Howard, who previously described himself as “surprised and concerned” from the campaign that ultimately left Vance a heartbeat away from the US presidency.\n\nOn Great Company, Basso argued that actors’ work gives them no authority to bestow their political views upon the public.\n\n“We’re saying words that we’re told to say,” the 30-year-old from St Louis said. “We’re told how to say them. We’re told where to stand. And then we’re telling people how to vote?\n\n“You should be quiet, you should do your job. You should … entertain people – then shut the fuck up.”\n\nBasso added: “We’re court jesters. We’re entertaining. We’re public servants. We’re there to perform, to entertain, and then all of sudden, the jester, because he’s in the courtroom starts to be like: ‘I might want to go sit on the throne!’”\n\nThe actor elaborated on remarks that he recently delivered to Variety, saying it was “weird” to him that his fate would probably be entwined with Vance’s to some degree for the rest of their careers.\n\nVance wrote the bestselling 2016 memoir that was adapted into a 2020 Netflix movie, helmed by Howard, starring Basso as a younger Vance and nominated for two Oscars involving others who worked on the film. Topics explored by the book and movie include Vance’s recollection of a volatile childhood in Middletown, Kentucky, as his mother struggled with opioid addiction – before he became a US senator for Ohio and served as Donald Trump’s running mate as he successfully campaigned for a second presidency in November.\n\n“When he’s thinking about his life – they made a movie of his book, and my name will always be in the description,” Basso said on the podcast.\n\nInitially, Vance was seen by many as an albatross to Trump’s campaign. He was criticized as a misogynist for labelling women without children as “childless cat ladies”. He was pilloried in some quarters for admitting that he boosted debunked stories about Haitian immigrants eating family pets in his native Ohio. And he was mocked by opponents over false rumors that he had sex with a couch, providing some context for when Howard told Variety in September that he was “surprised and concerned by a lot of the rhetoric coming out of that campaign” with which Vance had aligned himself.\n\nVance again raised eyebrows on Friday, when at the Munich Security Conference he accused European leaders of suppressing free speech, failing to halt illegal migration and loathing voters’ true beliefs. He also openly questioned whether Europe’s values deserved to be defended by the US.\n\n“If you’re running in fear of your voters, there is nothing America can do for you, nor for that matter is there anything you can do for the American people,” Vance said.\n\nFor his part, Basso said he perceived Vance to be “a cool dude”.\n\n“We talked a little bit,” Basso said. “We’re both from the midwest. We just talked about life – about growing up in the woods.”\n\nJudging just from Trump’s victory in November, many of Basso’s industry colleagues do not agree with his apolitical preferences.\n\nAmong the actors to endorse Trump were Russell Brand, Jim Caviezel, Mel Gibson, Zachary Levi, Dennis Quaid and Drea de Mattero. Meanwhile, the actors Robert DeNiro, Matt Damon, Mark Hammill, Will Ferrell, Dick Van Dyke and Julia Roberts were among those to endorse the campaign of Kamala Harris, who was Joe Biden’s running mate when he won the 2020 election and ended Trump’s first presidency.","summary":"Gabriel Basso says actors should ‘shut the fuck up’ and that they have no authority to publicly bestow political views\n\nThe actor who portrayed JD Vance in the Oscar-nominated film Hillbilly Elegy before the latter man became the vice-president of the US has said his fellow thespians should “shut the fuck up” rather than express their political opinions.\n\nGabriel Basso – now starring in the hit Netflix series The Night Agent – made those comments on a recent episode of the Great Company podcast, cutting a stark contrast with his director on Hillbelly Elegy, Ron Howard, who previously described himself as “surprised and concerned” from the campaign that ultimately left Vance a heartbeat away from the US presidency.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/17/jd-vance-gabriel-basso-hillbilly-elegy","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09ccaef749c8fb10aad45365bb724350cefb8c5d/0_0_3242_1945/master/3242.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmY","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-17 11:00:34","author":"Ramon Antonio Vargas","authors":["Ramon Antonio Vargas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.512},{"id":291280484,"title":"Kamala Harris blasted for rambling word salad speech while attempting to inspire the cast of Louis Armstrong musical on Broadway","text":"Kamala Harris has been mocked for delivering yet another word salad speech while giving a pep talk to the cast of a musical on Broadway.\n\nThe former Vice President made two surprise appearances alongside husband Doug Emhoff in New York this weekend, at Studio 54 for A Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical and later at the Majestic Theater for Gypsy.\n\nShe was greeted by cheers from the crowd and received a standing ovation, but it was her speech intended to inspire the cast and crew behind the scenes which has sparked the most controversy online.\n\n'In times when we're dealing with so much in the world, um, we have to find those moments that are about joy and, and, and, shining, you know, as we say, shining a light in moments of darkness,' she told the cast and crew of A Wonderful World.\n\n'When we think about these moments where we see things that are being taken, but also lets see it, you know, nature abhors a vacuum.\n\n'Where there's a vacancy, lets fill it.

You'd think she'd keep her mouth shut at this point,' another added.\n\nA third said: 'No self awareness. No filters. No adjustment.

Not only did I get my photo... I got all of this. There is still hope. There's still work to be done. We can't give up, or in.' \n\nSupporters flooded Barnes' comment section lamenting 'what could have been' if Harris had won the presidential race. \n\nShe lost both the popular vote and the electoral vote to President Trump.\n\n'Her presence is commanding yet gentle,' one Harris fan said.\n\nHarris was repeatedly criticized during her bid for the White House for delivering 'word salad' answers to straightforward questions. \n\nHer intended answer or message was often diluted by overcomplicating her answers - a point that Republicans and President Trump seized upon repeatedly.\n\nOver the Christmas period, she hosted a holiday reception for her supporters, urging them not to lose hope despite her devastating 2024 loss.\n\nDuring a speech to mark the event, Harris urged her supporters not to succumb to defeat, disappointment and depression.\n\nBut it quickly derailed into her signature 'word salad' gibberish as she droned on about food and the importance of getting rest.\n\n'Our work continues and so please everyone, look I know this election was not what we intended, certainly now what we wanted, I know there's a lot of emotion that we are all feeling right now. I get it,' she said with a knowing chuckle according to video clips published on social media.\n\n'Please I have to just, I have to insist, that please do not let your spirit or your purpose be defeated,' she added.\n\nPotentially her most famous 'word salad' is: 'We have dreams. We can see what is possible, unburdened by what has been.'\n\nHarris initially uttered the odd line when she spoke about what the word 'innovation' meant to her during a March 2023 speech during a trip to Ghana.\n\nSpeaking at the time, she said innovation was 'one's ability not only to see, but to do things differently' and 'challenging the premise, questioning the status quo, and bold thinking,' and 'the pursuit of what can be unburdened by what has been.' \n\nShe would burst into laughter after uttering the phrase 'you think you just fell out of a coconut tree?'.","summary":"The former Vice President made a surprise appearance at A Wonderful World in New York on Saturday, alongside partner Doug Emhoff.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14404601/Kamala-Harris-blasted-word-salad-Broadway.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/17/06/95285527-0-image-m-143_1739772634154.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-17 07:08:27","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.296},{"id":291280482,"title":"Jeff Bezos' Washington Post backs out of running $115,000 front page advertisement targeting Elon Musk","text":"The Jeff Bezos' owned Washington Post has reportedly backed out of running a $115,000 front page advertisement targeting DOGE head Elon Musk amid the Amazon founder's budding friendship with President Donald Trump.\n\nAdvocacy group Common Cause announced that it had signed the costly agreement with the newspaper to run an ad that would have covered the entire front and back page of Tuesday's paper as well as a full page advertisement inside the paper.\n\nThe group said it planned to purchase the ad in collaboration with the Southern Poverty Law Center Action Fund. \n\nCopies of the paper with the wrap would then be sent to subscribers on Capitol Hill, at the Pentagon and at the White House, according to The Hill. \n\nThe ad's design, which is still available on the group's website, features a large photo of Musk with his head tilted back, laughing, along with a cutout image of the White House.\n\n'Who's running this country: Donald Trump or Elon Musk?' it asked.\n\nFurther down on the page, the advertisement features smaller text that reads: 'Since day one, Elon has created chaos and confusion and put our livelihoods at risk. And he is accountable to no one but himself. \n\n'The Constitution only allows for one president at a time,' it says. 'Call our senators and tell them it's time Donald Trump fire Elon Musk.' It also included the URL FireMusk.org.\n\nCommon Cause President Virginia Kase Solomon told The Hill the paper's advertising sales representative was informed of the nature of the ad and seemed confident that running it over the paper wouldn't be a problem.\n\nBut on Friday, Common Cause was informed the Post would not run the wrap around advertisement.\n\n'We submitted the artwork back on Tuesday of last week. I'm assuming it went through a legal department or other kind of review,' she recounted.\n\n'They said, \"You can have something inside the paper, but you can't do the wrap.\"\n\n'We said \"thanks, no thanks\" because we had a lot of questions.\n\n'Is it because we're critical of what's happening with Elon Musk? Is it only OK to run things in The Post now that won't anger the president or won't have him calling Jeff Bezos asking why this was allowed?'\n\nThe decision came after Bezos was featured prominently at the 47th president's swearing-in ceremony, after he announced his plans too donate $1 million to the incoming president's inaugural fund.\n\nBezos and his fiancee Lauren Sanchez had earlier traveled to Mar-a-Lago for dinner with the then president-elect.\n\nFootage shared on X shows the couple holding hands and walking alongside Trump as they greet other guests.\n\nThe Post never provided an explanation for its decision not to run the wrap ad, she said, and the publication has a policy of not talking about its internal decisions related to specific ad campaigns.\n\nAccording to the paper's general guidelines for advertising, advertisers are responsible for complying with applicable law and regulation for political advertising, including using any required disclaimers.\n\nIt notes that The Post accepts advertising for all points of view, but reserves the right to require substantiation of factual claims.\n\nThe Post also requires advertisers to obtain 'the requisite permissions' when using the names or likeness of individuals.\n\nStill, Solomon said the rejection was a 'surprise' because the sample art they received from The Post to get an idea of what is acceptable was a wrap ad funded by the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers group highlighting Trump's promise to 'end the electric vehicle mandate on Day One.'\n\nIt featured a large photo of Trump flashing a thumbs up, she said.\n\n'It just causes concern for us,' she said of the paper's rejection. \n\n'Are they fearful of his rejection?' she said of Trump. \n\nSolomon pointed out that the paper refused to run an endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the presidential election and decided not to run a cartoon showing caricatures of Bezos, Mickey Mouse and others offering bags of money to Trump.\n\nShe noted that the planned $115,000 ad was a 'huge' expenditure for her group, but because the Post decided not to run it, neither Common Cause nor the Southern Poverty Law Center have to pay.\n\nIn the meantime, Common Cause has organized thousands of calls to Congress and the White House raising concerns about Musk's role in the federal government, slashing positions.\n\nIt has collected 60,000 signatures on a petition protesting Musk's position.\n\nThe group, along with the Southern Poverty Law Center Action Fund and End Citizens United, launched the Fire Elon Musk campaign on February 3.","summary":"The Jeff Bezos ' owned Washington Post has backed out of running an advertisement targeting Elon Musk amid the Amazon founder's budding friendship with President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14404679/Jeff-Bezos-Washington-Post-renegs-advertisement-targeting-Elon-Musk.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/17/06/95285493-0-image-a-16_1739774727967.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/01/20/3763335016129674593/1024x576_MP4_3763335016129674593.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-17 06:53:22","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.106},{"id":291516848,"title":"Trump’s imperialism gets savaged by voters.

Voters are close to split on the Panama Canal (41% support, 46% oppose), which the U.S. turned over to the Panamanians at the end of 1999. But when it comes to the other locations, it’s not even close: Majorities oppose the U.S. taking Greenland, Canada, and most starkly, Gaza. Only 23% want the U.S. to control Gaza, while 62% oppose that idea.\n\nAnd despite Trump’s flirtation with deploying U.S. troops to take Gaza, even a majority of Republican-likely voters (52%) oppose his idea.\n\nOf course, Trump’s territorial expansionism doesn’t end there. On the first day of his new term, he signed an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America” (and another order to make Feb. 9 “Gulf of America Day,” because everything must be this stupid). \n\nA new poll from Marquette University Law School—one of the best in the polling game—finds that just 29% support Trump’s “Gulf of America” rebrand, while a staggering 71% oppose it. While 57% of Republicans support it (because of course they do), only 16% of independents and 4% of Democrats do.\n\nWith numbers like that, Trump really should’ve just gone with his first plan: to rename it the Gulf of Trump and dye the water gold.\n\nBillionaires, billionaires, billionaires—you and me are through\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk delivered his first Oval Office address this past Tuesday, despite, you know, not being president. And there’s a strong chance that the Tesla guy is delusional about his appeal to the American public—because billionaires, well … Americans aren’t so hot on them.\n\nSeventy-three percent of likely voters think billionaires have too much influence over the federal government, according to a new poll from Data for Progress. That includes majorities of Democrats (80%), independents or third-party voters (80%), and Republicans (63%). \n\nWhen it comes to Musk himself, not only do strong majorities of Democrats (79%) and independents and third-party voters (65%) believe he has too much influence, even 1 in 3 Republicans thinks so.\n\nAnd that tracks with public opinion about billionaires generally. New polling from YouGov finds that 55% of Americans think the government should try to close the wealth gap between the richest and poorest Americans, while just 22% think the government shouldn’t try to.\n\nEven wilder, 49% of Americans think the government should “try to reduce the share of wealth” held by American billionaires. This phrasing is more radically progressive since it focuses on taking money away from the ultrarich and, unlike the previous question, does not mention poorer Americans at all. And yet even 1 in 3 Republicans still supports this type of governmental action. Only 27% of Americans oppose it.\n\nTo be fair, a lot of respondents surely assume this type of wealth reduction would be used to benefit those with less money. (I.e., if the ultrarich’s share of wealth lowers, then the less-rich sees their share of it rise.)\n\nBut it’s also possible that Americans just don’t like billionaires. Take heed, Musk.\n\nFive years of COVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 has claimed more than 1.2 million Americans’ lives since Jan. 1, 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And while the pandemic has largely faded as a health threat, its damage to American families continues to this day, according to a significant new study by the Pew Research Center that reflects on five years of COVID-19.\n\nAbout 1 in 4 Americans say the pandemic took a major toll on them, and nearly 1 in 2 said it took a minor toll. Compared with the public at large, Americans under the age of 50 are significantly more likely to say it took a major toll on them, as are Hispanic Americans.\n\nWhile 44% of Americans say they have mostly recovered from the toll the pandemic took on them, 1 in 4 have only somewhat recovered, and 6% have not recovered at all. \n\nThe pandemic indisputably furthered the partisan divide, from Republicans’ rage at basic health precautions like masking and vaccination to Democrats’ fury at Trump’s refusal to take the pandemic seriously. And Pew’s data reflects that divide growing across 2020. For instance, in March 2020, similar shares of Democrats (74%) and Republicans (84%) said that the CDC was doing an excellent or good job at managing the crisis. However, by January 2022, just 26% of Republicans had the same opinion, while Democrats’ view largely hadn’t changed (69%).\n\nSo it makes sense that 72% of Americans agree the pandemic drove the country further apart, according to Pew’s latest data.\n\nHowever, more than 1 in 10 Americans think the pandemic mostly brought the country together (yes, really), and another 16% say it didn’t affect things either way. But it’s possible that these folks—a combined 27%—are many of the same ones who say the pandemic took no toll on them whatsoever (25%).\n\nAny updates?\n\n Trump and co. are testing the waters of a constitutional crisis, suggesting they may disobey court orders in their pursuit of smothering the federal government—but they might face a big public backlash for it. Fifty-seven percent of Americans think a judge’s order trumps a president’s, with only 21% thinking the opposite, according to a new YouGov poll. (And yes, that 21% is largely made up of Republicans, who’d surely have a different opinion if a Democrat were scribbling out orders in the White House.)\n\n Eggs! You know ’em, you love ’em, you can’t afford ’em—and Trump doesn’t care, as Daily Kos has covered thoroughly. And those skyrocketing prices aren’t escaping Americans, 61% of whom have noticed egg prices increasing “a lot,” according to a new YouGov poll. Another 20% have noticed “a little” price increase.\n\n Since Democrat Kamala Harris lost last year’s presidential election, many have wondered if she’ll run for office again, possibly in California’s 2026 governor’s race. A new Emerson College poll for The Hill and Inside California Politics has good news for her: 57% of California Democrats say they’d support her if she ran for governor. Her closest competitor? Former Rep. Katie Porter, a whiteboard aficionado who sits at 9%.\n\nThough it’s been five years since COVID-19 hit the public consciousness, it’s just now been three years since Americans stopped worrying so much about it. Jan. 17, 2022, was the last time more registered voters were concerned about a local COVID-19 outbreak than weren’t, according to data from Civiqs. \n\nCuriously, though, the net level of concern has recently ticked up from its nadir of -71 percentage points in May 2024. It’s now -55 points. Perhaps fears around bird flu have got folks worried about outbreaks more generally. It could also be a cyclical thing since concern also rose last winter.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly column rounding up three of the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about.

The war’s end was never likely to affirm justice and international law. Russia remains the aggressor and Ukraine the victim but, as the fight became a war of attrition, the power differentials favoured might over right. Donald Trump’s re-election last year made an ignoble outcome in Ukraine a certainty.\n\nAnd now it is before us. The Trump White House has set out a welcome mat for accused war criminals. No sooner had Binyamin Netanyahu, indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in November 2024, left Washington, DC, smiling as Trump proposed the ethnic cleansing of Gaza, than he picked up the phone and talked to another ICC indictee, Vladimir Putin, about locking in his real estate gains in Ukraine. Like so much in Trump’s career, dirty deals and sordid realities will be covered up by balderdash and bunk in gold lettering. “It’s going to be the best peace ever.”\n\nTrump’s telephone diplomacy with Putin, however, has not received gold star reviews. The EU foreign policy chief, and Russia hawk, Kaja Kallas, complained that Trump had given Russia “everything that they want even before the negotiations”. Predictably the words appeasement and betrayal were thrown around.\n\nIt is, I have to say, surprising to me how European and Ukrainian leaders appear surprised by Trump’s actions. He has, after all, a long record of admiration for Putin. And he pointedly refused to say he wanted Ukraine to win its fight against Russian aggression during his debate with Kamala Harris. \n\nAmericans knew who they were re-electing to the presidency. Trump was the anti-establishment candidate, the critic of neoconservatives and forever wars. Though he is instinctively authoritarian and militarist, he won as the peacemaking candidate with respect to Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThough it may not be always apparent, Trump does have a geopolitical vision. Like many political realists, he believes in great power spheres of influence. He has strategic empathy for Putin’s argument that Russia should have a say over the security alignments of its neighbours. The principle, after all, is originally American: the Monroe Doctrine.\n\nTrump’s position is a direct repudiation of that of George W Bush who in 2008 pushed for Nato’s expansion to Georgia and Ukraine, despite opposition not only from Russia but from his own secretary of defence. \n\nNato’s subsequent Bucharest Declaration stating that Ukraine and Georgia would one day become members of the alliance radicalised geopolitical competition on the European Continent. Putin, who was at the Bucharest summit as Bush’s guest, left determined to assert Russia’s security red lines. Within four months he had invaded Georgia. Six years later he invaded Ukraine in response to what he deemed a Nato orchestrated coup.\n\nTrump’s geopolitical vision suggests that the US will retrench on the European Continent and seek to strengthen the US’s sphere of influence in the Americas. Absurdist talk about Canada becoming the 51st state of the US, and more ominous talk about seizing the Panama Canal, and Greenland, are in keeping with this vision. Violent actions against “drug lords” in Mexico or against Cuba cannot be excluded. What happens in the Pacific, with the Philippines and Taiwan, is an open question.\n\nEuropean outrage at Trump’s personalistic strongman-to-strongman diplomacy disguises sentiments that are widely shared but rarely expressed in public, namely that Ukraine needs to cut its losses and forge an ugly peace. Talk about territorial concessions to Russia is taboo, among mainstream European liberals at least, but three years of attritional war have generated a desire for an end to the fighting, one that enables refugees to return.\n\nThis has happened before. Between May 1992 and November 1995, war and ethnic cleansing across Bosnia-Herzegovina displaced more than a million people beyond the country. In November 1995, the US diplomat Richard Holbrooke led negotiations to end that war with its chief architect, the Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic. The 51-49 percentage partition of Bosnia agreed recognised the secessionist entity that instigated the war with legitimacy. That political entity, Republika Srpska, founded by convicted war criminals Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, endures in Bosnia. Justice was not served but refugees were able to return to the country. And justice did eventually come for the instigators of the war in the form of the International Criminal Tribunal on the Former Yugoslavia, a predecessor to the ICC.\n\nWhen historians write the history of the Russia-Ukraine war, they will ask whether the final settlement differs that much from the agreement initialled in Istanbul in April 2022. I suspect it will not be that different. They will ask whether thousands of lives could have been spared and billions in destruction avoided if hard material realities were not recognised then.\n\nLet us hope that Trump’s diplomacy does initiate a negotiation process to end to this brutal and destructive war. Ordinary Ukrainians are desperate for peace but they won’t accept a dictated settlement. Ukraine should be at the negotiating table and backed up by European leaders. Lives, not territories, should be the core concern. The peace will likely be negative and unpalatable. Reconstruction will be enormously challenging. But hope will remain.

It will likely also deter labor traffickers from using the UAC program to bring older teenagers into the United States for low-wage labor or prostitution.\n\nThe result will be fewer deaths and rapes, less exploitation of teenagers in U.S. jobs and prostitution, labor, and more young men and money for investment in poor countries.\n\nThe UAC law was passed unanimously in 2008 by House legislators amid a surplus of naivete, recklessness, and pro-migration cunning. Since then, Republicans have increasingly called for reform because the law has been exploited to import more than a million children and youths across the nation’s border.\n\nThe program was justified as a way to protect young people who were abandoned by traffickers who profited from labor and sex trafficking. But it was quickly converted into a coyote/federal delivery service for illegal migrants who wanted their left-behind children to join them in the United States rather than for them to return home.\n\nIt was also used by labor traffickers eager to get young men through the border for subsequent low-wage work in blackmarket jobs. At least 50 percent of the young UAC migrants were work-ready teenage boys and men.\n\nIn Trump’s first term, his deputies tried to curb the smuggling. For example, in 2018, deputies arrested 170 “sponsors” mostly because they were illegal migrants who paid coyotes to deliver their children via the government-supported UAC delivery service.\n\nIn response, Democrats — led. by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) — used their power in the Senate in 2019 to gag information exchange between the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The HHS agency houses and feeds the children and youths before they are released to sponsors.\n\nThe Democrats’ gag encouraged more child and youth smuggling and abuse in President Joe Biden’s administration, with the zealous help of Biden’s pro-migration border chief, Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nHis officials welcomed 500,000 young migrants through the UAC loophole to cross the border during his four years. The flood was caused when Biden’s migrants brought up their children and when labor traffickers dangled more jobs to poor young men in Central America.\n\nIn February 2023, the New York Times posted articles on labor traffickers and the workplace deaths of foreign teenagers. The news prompted a short-lived murmur of concern among Democrats.\n\nYouth sex trafficking and its myriad cruelties tripled under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, according to an October 2024 report in TheFreePress.com. There was little response from Democrats, who are dominated by business advocates for more migration.\n\nEven after these exposures, Democrats encouraged more child migrants. In December, for example, Biden’s pro-migration deputies posted a legal notice discouraging communication between HHS and ICE.\n\nThe quick handovers were justified as a child-protection measure by Democrats.\n\nOfficials “need to make sure that families [including illegal migrants] come forward to take custody of these [youth and] children, so they’re not held any longer [by HHS] than is necessary,” Greg Chen, the government relations director for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the Washington Post.\n\nTrump’s 2025 deputies, however, understand the smuggling business.\n\nMellissa Harper, an ICE official, has been appointed as acting director of HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement, which cares for the children and youths and hands them over to sponsors. In an e-mail sent on February 13, she wrote, “The pervasive fraud in the sponsor process is undeniable,” and she rebuked the ORR staff:\n\nI also am aware that there are internal and external stakeholders that subscribe to the belief that some fraud is necessary because they are opposed to the overall immigration system of the U.S. or just fail to recognize that their own actions are possibly contributing to the victimization of children.\n\nOn February 14, for example, officials posted new rules for HHS officials at the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) who deliver young migrants to sponsors:\n\nTo enhance the safety of releases to sponsors, prevent fraud, and combat trafficking, effective immediately, ORR will:\nRequire fingerprinting of all adult sponsors and their adult household members aged 18 and over, and adult caregivers identified in a Sponsor Care Plan. All potential sponsor, household member, and adult caregiver fingerprint results must be received, adjudicated, and recorded in the UAC Portal prior to approval for release.\nOnly accept unexpired and legible photocopies of identification documents for purposes of establishing identity under UAC Policy Guide …\nRequire potential sponsors, adult household members, and adult caregivers identified in a sponsor care plan, to present original unexpired versions (not photocopies) … Sponsors must also present the same original and unexpired identification documents upon the physical release of the child to the potential sponsor.\n\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also hired a former border officer to serve as an adviser.\n\nSo far, media coverage in the establishment media of the Trump policy has ignored the organized labor trafficking of youths and is silent about the illegal migrants who use the program to import their left-behind children. Instead, the youths and children are falsely portrayed as solitary migrants who take it upon themselves to walk up to the United States border.\n\nFor example, Bloomberg.com’s coverage of the issue is typical for how it hides the sex and labor smuggling and the prevalence of older teenagers, as it says:\n\nThe Trump administration has resumed sharing sensitive information about people who come forward to sponsor unaccompanied migrant children with immigration authorities, a move that is expected to keep children in government custody for longer, according to two people familiar with the policy.\n\n“When ORR gave information to DHS it prevented [illegal migrant] families from being able to get their kids out of government custody and into their safe and loving homes,” [Becky Wolozin, a lawyer at the National Center for Youth Law] said. “This policy just represents family separation in another form.”\n\nThe [2018 crackdown] also resulted in an increase in the number of children in ORR’s custody and in the length of their stay. By fiscal 2018, an unaccompanied child’s length of stay had increased to 60 days from 48 in the year prior, and early in fiscal 2019 it stood at 89 days, according to a Congressional Research Service report. Studies have found that time in institutional care has a negative effect on children’s health, a concern that was the subject of lawsuits challenging the policy in 2018.\n\nThe New York Times February 2023 article was more honest: “Twelve-year-old roofers in Florida and Tennessee. Underage slaughterhouse workers in Delaware, Mississippi and North Carolina. Children sawing planks of wood on overnight shifts in South Dakota.”\n\nRead about migrant sex trafficking here.","summary":"President Donald Trump's deputies have reformed the Democrats' 2008 \"Unaccompanied Alien Children\" (UAC) program to shrink migrant smuggling by labor traffickers and by illegal migrant parents.\n\n\nThe post Trump Admin Reforms ‘Unaccompanied Alien Children&#8217; Policy to Prevent Trafficking appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/02/16/trumps-deputies-shrink-federal-labor-sex-trafficking-uac-program/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/02/youth-migrants-file2024-crossing-us-border-mexico-getty-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-17 04:03:50","author":"Neil Munro","authors":["Neil Munro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":291333188,"title":"Bitcoin Ownership In The U.S. Surpasses Student Loan Holders","text":"Demographic analyses reveal that cryptocurrency adoption varies across different groups. Men aged 18 to 29 are the most prominent investors, with 42% reporting that they have engaged with cryptocurrencies. This contrasts with 17% of women in the same age bracket. Racial and ethnic disparities are also evident: 28% of Asian adults have invested in cryptocurrencies, compared to approximately 20% of Black and Hispanic adults, and 14% of White adults. Income levels further influence investment patterns, with 23% of adults in upper-income households participating in the crypto market, versus 14% in lower-income households.\n\nDespite the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies, skepticism persists. A survey conducted in October 2024 found that 63% of U.S. adults lack confidence in the safety and reliability of cryptocurrencies. This sentiment underscores the volatile nature of digital assets and the regulatory uncertainties surrounding them.\n\nConversely, the student loan landscape presents its own challenges. The percentage of households with student debt has more than doubled from 10% in 1992 to 21% in 2022. This rise is partly due to more Americans pursuing higher education and the escalating costs associated with it. The financial burden of student loans has far-reaching implications, affecting borrowers' ability to purchase homes, start businesses, and save for retirement.\n\nPolicy responses to these issues have been varied. The Trump administration has expressed skepticism towards widespread student debt forgiveness, favoring targeted relief measures instead. In contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris has advocated for more comprehensive solutions, including significant debt cancellation and the promotion of free college education to address systemic inequalities.\n\nArabian Post – Crypto News Network\n\nNotice an issue?\nArabian Post strives to deliver the most accurate and reliable information to its readers.
