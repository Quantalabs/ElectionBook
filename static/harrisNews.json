And it is evidence of a problem that is becoming more and more serious.\n\nLast year, there was another story like this one, in which we learned that from April 2023 to March 2024, the economy created 818,000 fewer jobs than the BLS had originally said, wiping out most of the economy’s gains. The number was finalized at about 600,000 jobs, fewer than originally estimated, but the gap between early reports and reality was huge.\n\nWhen that happened last year, candidate Donald Trump denounced the jobs numbers as fake. “New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the administration PADDED THE NUMBERS with an extra 818,000 jobs that DO NOT EXIST, AND NEVER DID,” Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\nFast forward to last month, August 1, 2025. BLS reported that the economy added just 73,000 jobs in July. But more importantly, BLS made huge downward revisions in the job numbers from May to June this year. The May numbers were revised from 144,000 to 19,000 jobs; the June numbers were revised from 147,000 to 14,000 jobs.\n\nTrump went off again. “In my opinion, today’s jobs numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad,” Trump posted. The president then fired Erika McEntarfer, the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner.\n\nThe great and the good rose to denounce Trump. That’s what they do. But now, with the latest huge revisions on top of the previous huge revisions, it seems reasonable to suggest that there is something terribly wrong with how the BLS counts the number of jobs created each month. That is not to say that Erika McEntarfer was trying to win the election for Kamala Harris, or that she was acting out of bald political bias. It is just to say that something is wrong.\n\nExperts point to problems with the BLS surveys of businesses that bring in the jobs data. On CNN Tuesday afternoon, Bill Beach, who was commissioner of BLS from 2019 to 2023, said, “We need to do some big things to reform the statistics,” suggesting BLS needs to go “deep inside and say, can we make the surveys better?”\n\nThis is important because many people in many corners of the economy rely on the BLS data. Businesspeople base business decisions on it. Government officials base governmental decisions on it. Politicians base political decisions on it. \n\nSo it needs to be fixed, and fast. On Tuesday, Vice President JD Vance posted, “It’s difficult to overstate how useless BLS data had become. A change was necessary to restore confidence.” Can anyone disagree with that?","summary":"THE GRIM NEWS ABOUT JOBS. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has revised the number of jobs it says were created in the year between April 2024 and March 2025.

Thirteen Republicans, including House Speaker Jon Patterson of suburban Kansas City, joined Democrats in opposition, though only a few spoke against it.The president posted on Truth Social, \"This new Map will give the wonderful people of Missouri the opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections. The Missouri Senate must pass this Map now, AS IS, to deliver a gigantic Victory for Republicans in the \"Show Me State,\" and across the Country.\"Why It MattersRepublicans currently hold six of Missouri's eight U.S. House seats, with Democrats representing districts in Kansas City and St. Louis. The new plan targets Kansas City Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, stretching his district eastward into heavily Republican rural areas while redistributing other parts of Kansas City into GOP-leaning districts.The move is part of a broader national battle over congressional maps, following similar efforts in Republican-led Texas and Democratic-led California. Other states, including Indiana, Florida, Maryland and New York, are also considering revisions.What To KnowU.S. House districts were redrawn nationwide after the 2020 census to reflect population shifts. The current push, known as gerrymandering, is aimed at gaining partisan advantage.Trump has urged Republicans to secure a congressional majority to advance his agenda. Historically, though, the party out of power has gained seats in midterm elections — a pattern that Democrats followed during Trump's first term before impeaching him.Missouri lawmakers are meeting in a two-pronged special session called by Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe. Along with the redistricting plan, the House also passed a measure that would raise the threshold for passing citizen-led constitutional amendments. The proposal would require majority support in each congressional district instead of a simple statewide majority, making it harder to enact initiatives on issues such as abortion rights, marijuana legalization and Medicaid expansion.In a statement, Kehoe praised Republicans for \"ensuring that the values of Missourians are represented clearly and effectively.\"Cleaver, who turns 81 in October, is a Methodist pastor and former Kansas City mayor first elected to Congress in 2004. He accused Republicans of fostering \"intimidation\" and \"division\" and vowed to challenge the map in court.\"It's one of those moments that, frankly, I never thought I would experience,\" Cleaver said in an interview with The Associated Press.House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Democrat from Kansas City, denounced the plan as \"hyperpartisan gerrymandering\" drawn along racial lines. Aune said Democrats expect an initiative petition drive to force a public referendum on the maps if they clear the Senate, a move that could delay or overturn the changes.Republicans countered that the new districts would be more compact and competitive.Leading up to the vote, three Democratic lawmakers staged a days-long sit-in at the House chamber to protest that the session began while most members were absent. Former Vice President Kamala Harris sent them pizza and chicken wings in support.Republicans are \"bending a knee to Donald Trump and pushing through these racist, gerrymandered districts,\" said Democratic Rep. Ray Reed of St. Louis, one of the sit-in participants.The Missouri NAACP has sued to block the special session, arguing there is no extraordinary circumstance to justify it and that the state constitution bars redistricting absent new census data or a court ruling invalidating current maps.Newly sworn-in Attorney General Catherine Hanaway disagreed, saying Monday she does not believe the state constitution prohibits mid-decade redistricting.What People Are SayingDemocratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said in a statement to Newsweek sent via email, \"Republicans know they're in trouble. Donald Trump and his party have ripped health care away from working families and jacked up prices on everyday goods in a self-serving plot to make the ultra-wealthy even wealthier. Now, instead of facing the music with the voters they've pissed off, Republicans want to silence them. Democrats won't let that happen. The Democratic Party is united in our commitment to defend the American people against Republicans' war on their rights and their pocketbooks. That's why the DNC is marshaling its resources to Missouri, the latest epicenter of Trump's gerrymandering scheme. The DNC stands with Missouri Democrats and voters across this country against Trump's plot to rig congressional maps. From the Missouri state House to Washington, D.C., the American people will be heard.\"Trump's post added, \"Congratulations to Missouri's incredible Republican State Legislators, who just overwhelmingly voted to pass their new, much fairer, and improved, Congressional Map. It was my Great Honor to win Missouri six times, including Primaries, in 2016, 2020, and 2024 (Getting the Highest Number of Votes for any Office in the History of the State!) I will be watching closely. THANK YOU MISSOURI — MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"GOP Rep. Bryant Wolfin said, \"Using our raw political power to tilt the playing field to our side, regardless of the party, is wrong.\"Rep. Dirk Deaton, a Republican, said, \"It's a congressional map that will better represent Missouri in Washington, D.C.\"Aune said, \"Under these new maps, they are erasing Emmanuel Cleaver from Congress essentially.\"What Happens NextThe mid-decade redistricting plan now heads to the state Senate where there are 24 Republicans and 10 Democrats.Update: 9/9/25, 7:27 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.Update: 9/9/25, 7:41 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new remarks.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.","summary":"Missouri's redistricting effort comes after a similar move by Republican-led Texas and a counter-offensive in Democratic-led California.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-missouri-redistricting-congress-map-republicans-2127327","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2719269/trump-speaks.jpg?w=1600&h=900&l=49&t=49&q=88&f=39ae2215d8f8068d676d416b91988de6","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-09 23:05:56","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.201},{"id":359057236,"title":"Letters: Recent drop in PG&E bills doesn’t put a dent in increases","text":"Drop in PG&E bills\ndoesn’t dent increases\n\nRe: “PG&E monthly bills begin to fall” (Page B1, Sept. 3).\n\nCalifornia electricity ratepayers are relieved to hear that electricity rates are finally coming down. However, a modest reduction of 2% is hardly enough to make up for recent rate increases of 41% over the past three years. The CPUC-sanctioned rate increases are largely due to overspending on grid transmission lines, which is the most profitable part of the investor-owned utility business.\n\nWe must electrify our homes and businesses to reduce carbon emissions, and we must continue to add renewable energy to our grid. California must continue the cap-and-trade program. Furthermore, some of the funds generated from the program must be returned to ratepayers to help support electrification efforts in California.\n\nPlease write your state senator and ask them to pass AB 1207, which renews the cap-and-trade bill. In addition, ask them to add a ratepayer dividend from the cap-and-trade revenues.\n\nTrump’s policies taking\njoy out of our nation\n\nRe: “Trump’s priorities are not our America” (Page A6, Sept. 4).\n\nA reader recently wrote that they are mourning the loss of the America they love. So am I. Our greatness has come from our enthusiasm and optimism — not the negativism and division of Donald Trump’s MAGA movement.\n\nGrowing up, I felt the USSR was dreary and depressing, painted in shades of black and gray. Josef Stalin and his successors were ruthless dictators; the communist economy was a disaster. Party loyalty was prized over merit; individual liberty was crushed. So were joy and hope.\n\nToday, we are governed by Trump’s egomaniacal quest for power and revenge. His Cabinet of Clowns shows that loyalty means more than competence. His hourly assault on American values, norms and the rule of law is crushing individual joy and optimism.\n\nIt’s hard not to see a bleak future for America. The “shining city upon a hill” is looking more black and gray. This has got to stop.\n\nIncreasing population\ngrowth isn’t sustainable\n\nRe: “Look to cultural norms for way to fix baby bust” (Page A6, Sept. 4).\n\nIn an op-ed, Daniel Moss summarizes the economic impact of declining fertility rates and populations. Although countries with the lowest fertility rates are among the healthiest and most advanced, it is certainly prudent to anticipate future trends. However, Moss completely ignores the impact of growing populations on the environment, human health and societal stability.\n\nMoss cites a projected population of around 10.3 billion in the 2080s. The 2025 world population is about 8.2 billion. This means an increase equal to that of the world’s most populous country, India, the United Statesand an additional 600 million. We already have a world drowning in plastic pollution, facing a rapidly warming climate, and with the fastest rate of species extinction in recorded history. In many regions, scarce resources are chronic causes of war and migration. The conclusion Moss ignores: A growing population is a major danger to humanity.\n\nTime to give women\nreins of the country\n\nThe divisive, illogical and regressive politics in today’s America are caused by men.\n\nIt is time for women to step forward, seize the day and straighten out this mess. A good place to start will be vaccines. Demand that legislators and administrators only use solid medical science in determining how our government will implement a sound vaccine program. All the while, publicize those who are obstructing your program.\n\nFrom vaccines, move on to other politicized programs that need reform — governance (end gerrymandering), the Epstein affair and tariffs. Demand fairness and rationality throughout our government. Where appropriate, take names and pledge to vote against any candidate who stands in your way.\n\nJohn Cormode\nMountain View\n\nGOP wants to add\nto voter suppression\n\nRe: “Trump already working to tilt 2026 election” (Page A6, Sept. 3).\n\nIt’s not only Donald Trump working at rigging the 2026 elections. Desperate to win at any cost, the anti-democracy GOP has been unlawfully rigging elections for decades.\n\nBased on data gathered by the U.S. Civil Rights Commission and the U.S. Elections Assistance Commission — and analyzed by the Brennan Center for Justice and MIT — the GOP rigged the 2024 election with massive voter suppression in 30 GOP-led states.\n\nTrump “won” by only 2.3 million votes (1.5%); obviously, Kamala Harris would have won handily if those millions of votes hadn’t been illegally suppressed.\n\nAnd the GOP is plotting more illegal voter suppression for the 2026 midterms.\n\nBill Charleston","summary":"Also: Robbing U.S. joy &#124; Population growth &#124; Women's turn &#124; Voter suppression.

But beyond its lack of accuracy, the site has increasingly revealed a clear liberal bias in its citations and editorial decisions. Last September, Ashley Rindsberg of The Free Press documented how a handful of powerful editors weaponized Wikipedia into a tool of Democratic agitprop. The piece highlighted how editors erased mention of Kamala Harris’ role as \"border czar\" after she became the nominee. Initially, Wikipedia referenced the title on Harris’ page, but it was quickly removed in deference to mainstream media outlets that insisted she had never been appointed as such. She was. Rindsberg found similar examples of politically motivated manipulation across entries on Donald Trump, COVID-19, and Hunter Biden’s laptop. A year later, nothing has changed. This week—just days after House Republicans launched an investigation into bad-faith edits to pages on Israel and Ukraine—Blaze Media uncovered that Wikipedia editors were trying to scrub the record clean of the violent thug who slaughtered Iryna Zarutska on a train in Charlotte, North Carolina. On Saturday morning, editors deleted any reference to the alleged killer’s name, preventing readers from easily learning about his criminal record. One editor defended the move as \"standard not to name suspected perpetrators,\" yet others quickly pointed out the inconsistency: Wikipedia had no issue naming Kyle Rittenhouse in 2020. At the time of publication, Wikipedia’s entry omitted the killer’s name entirely, except where it appeared in cited articles. Some editors tried to dismiss the case as insignificant, chalking it up to \"recent news.\" One editor argued that the attack wasn’t racially motivated, suggesting the killer was simply a \"schizophrenic in crisis.\" Of course, audio released Tuesday captured the killer shouting, \"I got that white girl\" immediately after the murder—a clear indication of racist intent. The editors' reasoning raises obvious questions: Why didn’t editors hesitate to spotlight Derek Chauvin’s name and background? And why hasn’t Wikipedia updated its entry to reflect the killer’s racist statement? The pattern is unmistakable. Wikipedia emphasizes names and motives when the narrative aligns with the media’s preferred storyline. When it doesn’t, facts are buried, minimized, or erased. One editor even accused \"white supremacists\" of trying to twist the incident, despite the reality being painfully clear: a racist black man killed a woman for her white skin color. The media’s relative silence only underscores the uncomfortable fact that black-on-white violence is more common than the reverse—something that cuts against the narrative many outlets promote. A separate editor has since nominated the article for deletion altogether. Wikipedia’s bias is not an accident. It is deliberate, systemic, and reinforced by policies that give a small group of editors immense power over which \"facts\" the public sees. While anyone can technically edit a page, the most politically sensitive entries are often locked down and controlled by administrators who overwhelmingly lean left. At this point, Wikipedia should no longer be regarded as a neutral resource. It has become a propaganda tool—one that manipulates narratives rather than presenting facts. Until it commits to accuracy and neutrality, Wikipedia is best ignored.","summary":"Wikipedia editors are trying to downplay details of Iryna Zarutska&apos;s murder.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/wikipedia-editors-trying-downplay-details-iryna-zarutskas-murder","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/09/gettyimages-2232567252.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-09 22:20:37","author":"Bobby Burack","authors":["Bobby Burack"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.233},{"id":359022204,"title":"No wonder there is fear of a population crisis — young men and women are wildly out of sync on family values","text":"Party lines are dividing Gen Z on big issues that weren’t political for their parents and grandparents: kids and marriage.\n\nA new poll found that young men who voted for Donald Trump prioritize having children above all else — but being a parent is of so little importance to young women who voted for Kamala Harris, it charted second to last out of 13 options.\n\nSomething that used to be taken for granted as a rite of passage and fact of life has now become yet another matter for political debate. \n\nIt’s really no surprise, considering right-wing influencers are pushing family values hard — while the left has adopted an attitude towards marriage and children that’s ambivalent at best and hostile at worst.\n\nThe poll, conducted in August and September by NBC News, asked 18- to 29-year-old Americans to choose their top three priorities from a list that included a fulfilling career, emotional stability, owning a home, being spiritually grounded and being debt-free.\n\nMarriage charted at No. 4 for male Trump supporters. Women who voted for the president, meanwhile, said achieving financial independence was their first priority. Having kids came in at No. 6, and getting married No. 9.\n\nBoth young men and women who voted for Harris prioritized a fulfilling career over everything else.\n\nAnd marriage? Democrat-voting males ranked it a lowly ninth place, and women eleventh.\n\nHaving kids fared even worse with Harris voters: No. 10 for men and a mere twelfth for women.\n\nNo wonder there is fear of a baby bust\n\nMy generation is absolutely scrambled and at odds when it comes to love and marriage, and that’s thanks in no small part to the fact that we’re all absorbing very different life lessons fro our internet influencers of choice.\n\nJordan Peterson’s lectures about marriage routinely rake in millions of views. Ben Shapiro and his fellow Daily Wire hosts sparked conversation with the video roundtable “Why You Should Get Married Young.” Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, urges men to have as many children as they can.\n\nCharlie Kirk went so far as to speak about Taylor Swift’s engagement on a recent episode of his podcast: “This is something that I hope will make Taylor Swift more conservative, engage in reality more and get outside of the abstract clouds. Reject feminism. Submit to your husband, Taylor.”\n\nThe bottom line: The conservative podcast world that is so influential with young men — even California governor Gavin Newsom admitted his son is a fan of Kirk — has embraced marriage, and embraced it strongly. \n\nConsidering statistics show that married men are wealthier, healthier and happier, they’re not wrong to do so.\n\nOn the flip side, the left has abandoned the idea that family has any intrinsic value. \n\nYoung women on TikTok are going “boy sober” and swearing off relationships with “voluntary celibacy” — viral movements that suggest love just simply isn’t worth the trouble.\n\nCelebrities popular with Gen Z push anti-marriage and anti-child messaging. Model Emily Ratajkowski straight up celebrated calling off her marriage with a “divorce ring.” \n\nAnd Zoomer pop-music icon Chappell Roan said on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast: “All of my friends who have kids are in hell.”\n\nThis “I don’t need a spouse” (or, for that matter, children) feminism has told left-leaning young women that pretty much everything else is more important than family.\n\nThat’s a very sad development. These are life decisions, not political footballs. \n\nMy generation is incredibly lucky to grow up in a moment when so many glass ceilings have been shattered for us. \n\nYoung women don’t need to choose between an “I don’t need a man” attitude and being a trad wife. And young men shouldn’t believe the only answers are having a submissive partner or turning into an incel.\n\nGen Z — male, female, right, left — needs positive, empowering messaging that teaches you can prioritize marriage, family and children, while also valuing independence, career and financial stability.\n\nIt’s time to make love apolitical again.\n\nThere is a bit of good news from the poll.

So it’s not nice to think that you can’t love whoever you want, because of the labels people need to stick on you…\n\n‘If what you’re experiencing is real, if you know you love each other, then there’s no reason to be alarmed.

There is more action in the first hour of this than every other film you’ve ever directed put together. Everything, it is really incredible,’ Steven Spielberg gushed to the 55-year-old filmmaker on Sunday.\n\n‘This is such a concoction of things that are so bizarre and at the same time so relevant, that I think have become increasingly more relevant than perhaps even when you finished the screenplay and assembled your cast and crew and began production.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio sported a distinct look with glasses as he attended the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Leonardo DiCaprio Spotted with Glasses During Day Out with Girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/leonardo-dicaprio-spotted-with-glasses-during-day-out-with-girlfriend-vittoria-ceretti/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Leo-DiCaprio-wears-glasses-on-outing-with-girlfriend-Vittoria-Ceretti.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-09 19:47:50","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.438},{"id":359000122,"title":"Democrats’ undemocratic Harris mistake","text":"When asked why Democrats are suffering so much in his part of the state, Burgess quickly jumped to the undemocratic way Harris took the nomination last summer.\n\nMore than 53,000 registered Democrats live in Washington County, but Harris got fewer than 45,000 votes there in 2024. Where were all those Democrats on Election Day?\n\n“We lost the trust of them in the way that we nominated Kamala,” Burgess argued in an interview with the Washington Examiner at a Texas Roadhouse bar on the outskirts of Pittsburgh. “We, as the Democratic Party, basically … did things that made our people question us and show that we weren’t totally on the up and up.”\n\nThat is, party leadership basically skipped the primary process by running a very elderly former President Joe Biden, then pushing him out and replacing him with Harris. It was a totally undemocratic process, and establishment liberals thought it was brilliant.\n\n“A primary is a good opportunity for the left to ask Democratic Party politicians to make electorally toxic public commitments … Alternatively, if the candidates refuse to make these commitments, it gives them something to complain about,” wrote Matthew Yglesias, a liberal blogger who puts a lot of weight on pragmatism. “By skipping the primary, Democrats have gotten themselves a nominee that rank-and-file Democrats are enthusiastic about without her needing to do that. This is good for the cause of beating Trump, which is good for the cause of progressive policy …”\n\nThe technocratic liberal mindset has never blended well with democracy because its operating premise is that the smart people already know the right answer.\n\n“We know what works,” former President Barack Obama used to proclaim, impatiently. “We know what we have to do. We’ve just got to put aside the stale and outmoded debates.”\n\nLetting the rank-and-file debate who to nominate? Stale and outmoded!\n\nHandpicking Harris, outside of a contentious primary, was “smart,” declared historian Alan Lichtman. Picking Harris without democracy maintained the incumbent advantage because there was “no serious contest for the incumbent-party nomination.” \n\nBurgess holds the opposite view. He argued that denying the voters a nomination contest harmed Harris.\n\n“Basically, there was no primary for all people to decide who we wanted to run … I can show you tons of messages I had from friends of mine that were like, ‘Why are we forcing this lady down our throat?'” he said.\n\n“I tell you what happens if you have a primary,” Burgess continued, “You may have a different result come November of that year, because there’s more of a way to get on board … At least you show the fairness in the process.”\n\nHOW TRUMP’S FREE SPEECH CLAMPDOWN COULD BOOMERANG ON MAGA\n\nBurgess is right. When more people have a say in the process, you may make a better choice (that is, pick a better candidate than Harris), but also you get the participants more on board. Supporters of other candidates might have accepted Harris more if they felt their guy had had a fair chance.\n\nThis cuts against the technocratic, central-planning, and hyperpragmatic mindset. It’s almost a conservative insight. One wonders if the Democrats, with their declared love of democracy, can figure it out soon.","summary":"PITTSBURGH — &#8220;There should have been a primary.&#8221; Jo Jo Burgess was a delegate at the Democratic National Committee and a full-throated supporter of former Vice President Kamala Harris in the general election.

HUD Secretary Scott Turner Aims to Revive It.","text":"The American dream is in crisis.\n\nA study published by Pew Research last year found that only 42% of adults under 50 say the American dream is still attainable. The belief is bipartisan: Only 38% of Democrats under 50 and 48% of Republicans under 50 believe it is possible to achieve the American dream.\n\nPresident Donald Trump felt the storm gathering. He turned heads when he descended down the golden escalator of Trump Tower in 2015 and thundered that “sadly, the American dream is dead.” He captured that lightning in a bottle not once but twice, observing that under former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, “you don’t hear about the American dream anymore—it’s dead.”\n\nAnd what’s the American dream without the white picket fence? Generations of Americans have grown up believing that owning a home has been a key tenet of living the American dream, but homes are increasingly unaffordable. For this monumental task, Trump has tapped Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner. Turner joined “The Signal Sitdown” this week to discuss a housing crisis that isn’t just about houses—it’s about the soul of our homeland.\n\nOne reason why young Americans and their families feel the American dream slipping away is the increasing unaffordability of a home for the average American. From the 1960s to the 1980s, the average house cost about three times the yearly median wage in America. Today, the average house costs seven times the yearly median wage.\n\nTurner told The Daily Signal that “there’s several factors” behind this trend. \n\n“The regulatory environment is crippling building,” Turner said. “Developers find it more difficult to develop, more difficult to build. And so, at [the Department of Housing and Urban Development], we’ve been very intentional from day one of taking inventory of our regulatory environment and the regulations that we have.” Cuts to those regulations have already started, with the Trump administration working to undo the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule, a Biden-era regulation that placed federal restrictions on using local land to build housing.\n\nIllegal immigration has been another factor. “When you look at our country and how between 10 and 20 million people came into our country illegally,” Turner continued, “this has hindered our housing industry and caused housing prices to go up.”\n\nTo no surprise, the average rent has nearly doubled over the same time period housing has more than doubled, even when adjusted for inflation. It’s a double blow for young Americans and their families hoping to buy a home. Higher housing costs force young Americans into renting, and high rents means less savings to someday afford a house.\n\nThe result? Many Americans have been forced to delay buying a home. In 2008, the average age of a first-time homebuyer was about 30, and it had been that way for three decades. Less than two decades later, and the average age of a first-time homebuyer is 38—an all-time high.\n\nTurner understands that having a country of renters is much different than a country of owners. \n\n“The American people, not only are they the one priority, they’re the only priority when it comes to HUD-funded housing,” Turner said. \n\n“We have to continue to work hard to make sure that those costs come down. When we came into this administration, our fiscal house was not in order,” Turner claimed. “The president and this administration under his leadership is getting our fiscal house in order.”\n\nPutting the nation’s fiscal house in order is necessary “to help people live lives of self-sustainability, to help people to achieve their American dream and home ownership, and to help people, really, to live out their God-given potential,” the HUD secretary added.\n\n“The American home is the American dream,” Turner said, “and at HUD we have the heart to help every American achieve the American dream.”","summary":"The American dream is in crisis.

Trump’s approval ratings, both in this term and 45th presidency, have been historically low compared to other modern presidents, but polling averages suggest the numbers have leveled in recent weeks. An Economist/YouGov poll found that inflation, prices, and the economy are the top concerns for voters. This poll was conducted before the August jobs report showed slowed hiring and rising unemployment, as reported by USA Today. Trump approval rating trendsAccording to RealClearPolitics, Trump’s approval rating became more negative in early July, then stabilized by late July, holding steady through August. RealClearPolitics data shows that on Jan. 27, Trump had a +6.2 percentage point approval margin. By March 13, it shifted negative. The lowest point came April 29 at -7.2 points, near his 100th day. It fell again to -7.1 points on July 22–23 during the Epstein controversy, as mentioned in the reports. As of Sept. 8, Trump’s approval margin averaged -6.1 points in RealClearPolitics polling, while the New York Times aggregator recorded -8 points on the same date. Gallup’s historical analysis shows Trump’s August approval ratings during his first years (both as 45th and 47th president) were lower than any modern president at the same stage.

Among specific issues, inflation/prices had Trump’s worst net rating at -30 points. The poll surveyed 1,691 U.S. adults with a margin of error of ±3.5 points. An Emerson College Polling survey (Aug. 25–26) found Trump with 45% approval and 47% disapproval, showing a smaller gap than some other polls, as per the report by USA Today.

I have spent the last few months shoring up our businesses and making sure the right leaders are in place; and I have no doubt they will continue to set the standard.”\n\nParamount and Trump would settle the “60 Minutes” suit for $16 million in July, but it would notably include no apology. Three weeks later, the FCC approved the Paramount-Skydance merger.\n\nTrump has since claimed that Skydance struck a $20 million deal for public service announcements and that the value of the settlement is actually higher.\n\nWhen asked about the PSAs in August, Skydance Media CEO and Paramount’s new owner David Ellison said the company was not involved in the settlement talks, adding: “I do not want to politicize our company in any way shape or form, we want to obviously speak to the biggest audience possible.” \n\nIn addition to the settlement, Skydance agreed to appoint an ombudsman for at least two years, who would review complaints of bias at the network. On Monday, Paramount revealed former Hudson Institute CEO Kenneth Weinstein would fill the role.\n\nSince launching in 2021, newsletters on beehiiv have generated tens of millions of dollars each month and dozens have been acquired, Denk said. \n\nAmong the successful newsletters on the platform is Oliver Darcy’s Status, which Denk said surpassed $1 million in annual recurring revenue in eight months. \n\n“We’re building something so much more than just a newsletter platform,” Denk added. “We’re building an operating system for publishers, creators, and entrepreneurs to succeed.”","summary":"The newsletter platform's co-founder and CEO Tyler Denk says she will help it \"continue to push the limits of what’s possible in this new age of independent journalism\"\n\n\nThe post Ex-CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon Joins Beehiiv as Advisor appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/wendy-mcmahon-beehiiv-advisor/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/wendy-mcmahon-cbs.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-09 16:21:19","author":"Lucas Manfredi","authors":["Lucas Manfredi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.231},{"id":358959678,"title":"US household income rose slightly last year, roughly matching 2019 level","text":"By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics Writer\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The income for the typical U.S. household barely rose last year and essentially matched its 2019 peak, the Census Bureau said Tuesday, as stubbornly high inflation offset wage gains.\n\nThe report also showed that the highest-earning households received healthy inflation-adjusted income increases, while middle- and lower-income households saw little gain.\n\nMedian household income, adjusted for inflation, in 2024 was $83,730, the Census Bureau said, a 1.3% increase from the previous year’s level of $82,690.

The Lone Star State has not elected a Democratic senator since 1988, and President Donald Trump won the state by double digits against former Vice President Kamala Harris last November.The results of the primary elections will be critical. Polls suggest Allred could be competitive in a general election, but that Democrats have not coalesced around him. On the Republican side, longtime Senator John Cornyn is facing a challenge from Attorney General Ken Paxton, who polls suggest could be vulnerable in a general election.What to KnowTalarico, viewed as a rising star among Democrats who rose to national prominence amid the state's redistricting battle, made official his plans to run for Senate on Tuesday. In a campaign launch video, Talarico said billionaires \"want us looking left and right at each other so that we're not looking up at them.\"\"We're underdogs in this fight. We're going up against those billionaire mega-donors and their puppet politicians. We're going up against a rigged system. And we're going up against a lot of money,\" he said. \"But I'm a former middle school teacher, I don't scare easily. And Texans don't scare easily.\"Two recent polls point to a potentially close primary race between Allred and Talarico, though Allred held a single-digit lead in both surveys.A recent poll from Texas Southern University's Barbara Jordan Public Policy Research and Survey Center found that in a two-way race, Allred would hold a seven-point advantage over Talarico (50 percent to 43 percent).Eighty-five percent of Democrats viewed Allred favorably, while 11 percent viewed him unfavorably. Four percent said they didn't know enough about him to say how they viewed him. Meanwhile, 63 percent of Democrats viewed Talarico positively and one percent viewed him unfavorably. Thirty-six percent had not heard enough about him to say, according to the poll.The poll surveyed 1,500 likely Democratic primary voters from August 6 to August 12, 2025 and had a margin off error of plus or minus 2.53 percent.A Public Policy Polling survey from early September similarly showed Allred up eight points over Talarico (40 percent to 32 percent). The poll was first reported by Politico.\"The single-digit deficit is impressive considering the difference in name recognition between the two candidates—Allred has 76% name recognition compared to just 48% for Talarico. Once voters hear a little about Talarico he gets the upper hand—after hearing short bios about each candidate, he takes a two-point lead over Allred, 38-36,\" the polling memo reads.The poll surveyed 510 likely Democratic primary voters in Texas from September 3 to September 4, 2025 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percent.Democratic Strategist Weighs InTalarico is a \"fresh face in Texas politics\" and is \"rising to meet the moment, Texas Democratic strategist Joel Montfort told Newsweek.\"Talarico's disarming all-American charm, his religious sensibilities, and his common-sense approach to policy make him a strong candidate in Texas. People respond to his ideas and his vision. He will have to work hard to differentiate himself from Allred and make sure he continues to show up everywhere in the state,\" he said.This could be a \"real challenge\" for Allred, who faced criticism for not connecting with grassroots voters and not campaigning actively across the state in 2024, Montfort said.Can Talarico Defeat a Republican?No polls testing how a match-up between Talarico and Republicans in the general election would play out have been made public, but Republicans are generally viewed as being favored in Texas.Montfort said he believes Talarico can be a strong general election candidate.\"If he can maintain his energy and get in front of voters, I think he will deliver voters and close the gap like O'Rourke did in 2018. Turnout for Texas Democrats will be key in next year's election, and from what I am hearing, we smell blood in the water and are expecting long lines at the polls,\" he said.The state did shift leftward throughout the late 2010s, with Democrats coming relatively close in some races. Former Representative Beto O'Rourke lost to GOP Senator Ted Cruz by fewer than three points in 2018, while former President Joe Biden lost to Trump by fewer than six points in 2020.But Texas moved back to the GOP in 2024, with Trump winning by more than 13 points. And Allred fared a bit better than Harris, losing to Cruz by more than 8 points.Polls suggest that 2026, when Democrats are hoping for a better national environment, could be an opportunity to win in Texas again, particularly if Paxton emerges victorious from the GOP primary.A recent Allred internal, conducted by GBAO, showed Allred up two points over Paxton (49 percent to 47 percent). It surveyed 800 likely voters from August 13 to August 18, 2025 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.Internal polls are typically not viewed as reliably as independent surveys, but the poll underscores the potentially competitive nature of the race.An Emerson College poll showed Paxton up by five points against Allred (46 percent to 41 percent), while Cornyn led by about seven points (45 percent to 38 percent). It surveyed 1,000 registered voters from August 11 to August 12, 2025 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.What People Are SayingAllred responded to Talarico's announcement in a statement: \"I've never taken anything for granted in life or politics, and this campaign is no exception. I know why I'm running: to lower costs, tackle the affordability crisis head-on, and stop corrupt politicians like John Cornyn and Ken Paxton from rigging the system to make life more expensive for hardworking Texans. For the next fourteen months, my focus will be on meeting with and listening to Texas families—all across our state—to build the diverse coalition we need to win.\"Democratic strategist Victor Shi wrote on X: \"Pay attention to James Talarico. He's 36. He's social media savvy. He communicates with all audiences calmly. He talks about issues not many Democrats talk about.

With his final term as California governor ending in 2026, Newsom is already viewed as a strong contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination.What To KnowAccording to Race To The White House, an aggregate polling tracker, Newsom currently leads the polls in a hypothetical 2028 Democratic primary race in two states—his home state of California (23.2 percent) and Ohio (20 percent). He is more than 5 percent ahead of Buttigieg in both.Buttigieg, meanwhile, is showing stronger momentum in several states, holding 23.4 percent in New Hampshire, 23 percent support in Florida, 16.8 percent in North Carolina, and 21.6 percent in Texas.Newsom's standing in those same states lags behind, with 23.1 percent in New Hampshire.In Florida, Newsom has 12 percent support, placing him third behind New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 10.2 percent in North Carolina and 19.5 percent in Texas, putting him just behind Buttigieg.Polling information is not currently available for other states.In the Public EyeThe poll results came as Newsom has attempted to increase public visibility in recent months, launching a podcast featuring conversations with conservative figures like Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon, signaling an attempt to broaden his appeal beyond traditional Democratic bases. He also announced that he would sue the Trump administration over the so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, which ignited stock market volatility.He has also shifted some of his rhetoric toward the political center, including proposing cuts to health care for immigrants without legal status, and revealing that he is against transgender athletes competing in women's events, both of which drew backlash from other members of his party.Despite these moves, some polls show little appetite for a 2028 bid from Newsom.An Emerson College Polling/Inside California Politics/The Hill survey, conducted between April 12 and April 14 among 1,000 California registered voters, found that 59 percent of respondents said they didn't think that Newsom should run for president in 2028, with 41 percent supporting a bid for the Oval Office.Meanwhile, a poll, conducted by co/efficient between May 7 and May 9 among 1,462 likely voters, found that just 2 percent of voters saw Newsom as the face of the Democratic Party.The poll showed that Ocasio-Cortez is viewed by more Democratic voters as the face of the party than any other figure, with 26 percent naming her—matching the number who said \"no one.\"Ocasio-Cortez has not formally announced a presidential bid for 2028.But more recent polls tell a different story. A McLaughlin & Associates poll from this month showed Newsom doubling his support to 18 percent in August, up from 9 percent in July, though former Vice President Kamala Harris remained ahead with 27 percent, rising slightly from 25 percent. Nine percent of respondents said they would vote for Buttigieg.And a Morning Consult survey released this month showed that Newsom's support grew from 11 percent in June to 19 percent in August.Christian Grose, a professor of political science and international relations at the University of Southern California, told Newsweek that Newsom's \"bold stances on redistricting\" and \"aggressive social media usage\" helped improve his image among Democrats.\"His willingness to take redistricting to voters to counter Trump's request to have Texas Republicans redraw their lines to help the GOP has especially been key to Newsom's stock rising with Democratic primary voters nationally,\" he said.To extend and grow this lead, Newsom will need to \"reach beyond base Democratic voters and start to make some inroads with independent voters,\" Grose said. This will show he can perform well in the general election, where independents are key, he added.Newsom has expressed ambivalence about a 2028 presidential run, but he has not ruled it out. In June, he told The Wall Street Journal: \"I'm not thinking about running, but it's a path that I could see unfold.\"What People Are SayingCNN's Harry Enten said in an August 20 X post: \"Newsom's social media strategy/opposition to Trump is working.

This was where a team from the new Department of Government Efficiency was going to set up shop.\n\nDOGE was already terrifying the federal bureaucracy with the prospect of mass job loss and intrusions into previously sacrosanct databases. Still, Dudek and a handful of his tech-oriented colleagues were hopeful: If any agency needed a dose of efficiency, it was theirs. “There was kind of an excitement, actually,” a longtime top agency official said. “I’d spent 29 years trying to use technology and data in ways that the agency would never get around to.”\n\nThe Social Security Administration is 90 years old. Even today, thousands of its physical records are stored in former limestone mines in Missouri and Pennsylvania. Its core software dates back to the early 1980s, and only a few programmers remain who understand the intricacies of its more than 60 million lines of code. The agency has been talking about switching from paper Social Security cards to electronic ones for two decades, without making it happen.\n\nDOGE, billed as a squad of crack technologists, seemed perfectly designed to overcome such obstacles. And its young members were initially inquisitive about how Social Security worked and what most needed fixing. Several times over those first few days, Akash Bobba, a 21-year-old coder who’d been the first of them to arrive, held his face close to Dudek’s scroll, tracing connections between the agency’s venerable IT systems with his index finger. Bobba asked: “Who would know about this part of the architecture?”\n\nBefore long, though, he and the other DOGErs buried their heads in their laptops and plugged in their headphones. Their senior leaders had already written out goals on a whiteboard. At the top: Find fraud. Quickly.\n\nDudek’s scroll was forgotten. The heavy paper started to unpeel from the wall, and it eventually sagged to the floor.\n\nIt only got worse from there, said Dudek, who would — improbably — be named acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration, a position he held through May. In 15 hours of interviews with ProPublica, Dudek described the chaos of working with DOGE and how he tried first to collaborate, and then to protect the agency, resulting in turns that were at various times alarming, confounding and tragicomic.\n\nDOGE, he said, began acting like “a bunch of people who didn’t know what they were doing, with ideas of how government should run — thinking it should work like a McDonald’s or a bank — screaming all the time.”\n\nThe shock troops of DOGE, at the Social Security Administration and myriad other federal agencies, were the advance guard in perhaps the most dramatic transformation of the U.S. government since the New Deal. And despite the highly public departure of DOGE’s leader, Elon Musk, that campaign continues today. Key DOGE team members have transitioned to permanent jobs at the SSA, including as the agency’s top technology officials. The 19-year-old whose self-anointed moniker — “Big Balls” — has made him one of the most memorable DOGErs joined the agency this summer.\n\nThe DOGE philosophy has been embraced by the SSA’s commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who was confirmed by the Senate in May. “Your bias has to be — because mine is — that DOGE is helping make things better,” Bisignano told senior officials weeks after replacing Dudek, according to a recording obtained by ProPublica. “It may not feel that way, but don’t believe everything you read.”\n\nIn a statement, a Social Security Administration spokesperson said that Bisignano has made “notable” initial progress and that “the initiatives underway will continue to strengthen service delivery and enhance the integrity and efficiency of our systems.” The statement asserted that “under President Trump’s leadership and his commitment to protect and preserve Social Security, Commissioner Bisignano is strengthening Social Security and the programs it provides for Americans now and in the future.”\n\nFor all the controversy DOGE has generated, its time at the Social Security Administration has not amounted to looming armageddon, as some Democrats warn. What it’s been, as much as anything, is a missed opportunity, according to interviews with more than 35 current or recently departed Social Security officials and staff, who spoke on the condition of anonymity mostly out of fear of retaliation by the Trump administration, and a review of hundreds of pages of internal documents, emails and court records.\n\nThe DOGE team, and Bisignano, have prioritized scoring quick wins that allow them to post triumphant tweets and press releases — especially, in the early months, about an essentially nonexistent form of fraud — while squandering the chance for systemic change at an agency that genuinely needs it.\n\nThey could have worked to modernize Social Security’s legacy software, the current and former staffers say. They could have tried to streamline the stupefying volume of documentation that many Social Security beneficiaries have to provide. They could have built search tools to help staff navigate the agency’s 60,000 pages of policies. (New hires often need at least three years to master the nuances of even one type of case.) They could have done something about wait times for disability claims and appeals, which often take over a year.\n\nThey did none of these things.\n\nUltimately, no one had a more complete view of the missed opportunity than Lee Dudek. A 48-year-old with a shaved pate and a broad build that suggests an aging former linebacker, Dudek is a figure seemingly native to the universe of President Donald Trump — an unlikely holder of a key post, elevated after little or no vetting, who briefly attains notoriety in Washington circles before vanishing into obscurity — not unlike Anthony Scaramucci in the first Trump administration.\n\nDudek, a midlevel bureaucrat with blunt confidence and a preference for his own ideas, had failed in his one past attempt to manage a small team within the SSA, leading him and his supervisors to conclude he shouldn’t oversee others. Despite that, Trump made him the boss of 57,500 people as acting commissioner of the agency this spring.\n\nDudek got the job, wittingly or not, through an end-run around his bosses. After Trump won the 2024 election and rumors of a cost-cutting-and-efficiency SWAT team began to swirl, Dudek asked people he knew at big tech companies for introductions to potential DOGE members. In December, a contact set him up with Musk’s right-hand man, Steve Davis, which led to conversations with other DOGE figures about how they could “hack” Social Security’s bureaucracy to “get to yes,” Dudek said.\n\nBy February, Dudek had become the conduit between DOGE and the SSA, alerting top agency officials that DOGE wanted to work at headquarters. And unlike Michelle King, the acting agency chief at the time, Dudek was willing to speed up the new-hire training process to give DOGE access to virtually all of the SSA’s databases. This precipitated a sequence of events that began with him being placed on administrative leave, where he wrote a LinkedIn post that propelled him into the public eye for the first time: “I confess,” he posted. “I helped DOGE understand SSA. … I confess. I … circumvented the chain of command to connect DOGE with the people who get stuff done.” The same weekend, King resigned and Dudek, who was at home in his underwear watching MSNBC, got an email stating that the president of the United States had appointed him commissioner.\n\nBetween February and May, when Dudek’s tenure ended, his erratic rhetoric and decisions routinely madefront-page news. He was often portrayed as a DOGE patsy, perhaps even a fool. But in his interviews with ProPublica this summer, he revealed himself to be a much more complex figure, a disappointed believer in DOGE’s potential, who maintains he did what he could to protect Social Security’s mission under duress.\n\nDudek is the first agency head to speak in detail on the record about what it is like to be thrust into such an important position under Trump. He told ProPublica that he decided to speak because he wishes that “those who govern” would have more frank and honest conversations with the public.\n\nTo the 73 million Americans whose financial lives depend on the viability of Social Security, those first months were a seesaw of apprehension and rumor. Inside the agency, Dudek, ill-prepared for leadership or for DOGE’s murky agenda, was stumbling through the chaos in part by creating some of his own.\n\nDudek knows what it’s like to depend on Social Security. When he was a kid in Saginaw, Michigan, his mother turned to Social Security disability benefits to support him and his siblings after she got injured at a Ford-affiliated parts factory; she also had a mental-health breakdown. (Dudek’s now-deceased father, who worked for General Motors, was alternately abusive and absent, according to the family.)\n\nAt school, Dudek was isolated and bullied for being poor, his sister told ProPublica, and he’s had an underdog’s quick temper ever since. But he was always an advanced student, and he developed an early interest in computer science and politics. As a teenager, he often watched C-Span. He was fascinated, he said, by “how government worked and how it could change people’s lives.”\n\nDudek arrived in Washington in 1995 to attend Catholic University of America. He was the type of earnest young man who was enthralled by President Bill Clinton’s campaign at the time to “reinvent government” by injecting it with private sector-style efficiency, much as Trump and DOGE later said they would.\n\nIn college, he also displayed the tendency to buck authority that would mark his professional career. He had a night job running the university’s computer labs; if there were problems, he was supposed to call his boss. He wasn’t supposed to install new software on all the computers, but that’s what he did. It worked, although he got a talking-to about knowing his role.\n\nAfter graduating, Dudek spent nearly a decade working for tech companies that contracted with the federal government on modernization projects, before migrating to several jobs within federal agencies themselves.\n\nIn 2009, he arrived at the Social Security Administration as an IT security official. The agency was just like the Saginaw he’d run from, Dudek said: an insular, hidebound place where everyone knew everyone and they all thought innovation would cost them their jobs.\n\nBut the SSA wasn’t the only institution at fault. Congress had enacted byzantine eligibility requirements for disability and Supplemental Security Income benefits, forcing the agency to expend huge amounts of time and money running those programs. At the same time, lawmakers had capped the agency’s administrative funding just as tens of millions of Baby Boomers were aging into retirement, exploding Social Security’s rolls. (The SSA is now at its lowest staffing level in a half-century, even as it has taken on 40 million more beneficiaries.)\n\nBecause of the SSA’s stultifying culture, Dudek said, he leaned into his insubordinate streak. He had the sense that he could do it better, and when he felt like his proposals weren’t receiving money or attention, he went around his superiors. In one instance, he approached potential partners at credit card companies, hoping they would like his ideas for combating fraud and would relay those ideas to the Social Security commissioner at the time. “Certainly from an internal perspective within SSA, certainly from a congressional perspective, I was violating rules,” Dudek said.\n\nIn part because of moves like this, Dudek got reassigned within the agency several times. Over the years, he was given multiple roles as a “senior adviser,” a title he said is for federal employees who are either incompetent but too established to fire or highly competent in a technical way but lacking in management or people skills.\n\nDudek was stubborn. He could come off as a know-it-all, and he tended to ramble when speaking. But he is also thoughtful and well read. In our interviews, he brought up everything from the origins of the concept of Social Security among sociologists and psychologists in the Depression era to the bureaucrats who were left behind in faraway places after the decline of the British Empire. He repeatedly cited James Q. Wilson’s seminal 1989 book, “Bureaucracy,” which spills considerable ink on the inefficiencies of the Social Security Administration — and on a businessman named Donald J. Trump who supposedly knew how to cut through red tape to get building projects done. (“No such law constrained Trump,” Wilson wrote.)\n\nDudek had been a lifelong Democrat and voted for Kamala Harris. But, like some other liberals, he was becoming exasperated with the “administrative state” and special-interest groups, including corporations, unions and social-justice organizations, that “capture” government and stifle reform. If it took Trump to cut through that, Dudek was open-minded. “The world has changed,” he scribbled in a note to himself. “We must change with it.”\n\nImmediately after Dudek became commissioner in February, he got a call from Scott Coulter, a hedge fund manager with a $12 million Manhattan apartment who’d been picked to lead DOGE’s team at Social Security. “We’re coming,” Coulter said. “Be prepared.”\n\nDOGE arrived ready to embark on a specific mission: Its operatives at the Treasury Department had seen data suggesting that the Social Security Administration wasn’t keeping its death records up to date. They thought they saw signs of fraudulent payments. Musk was very, very interested.\n\nDudek wasn’t initially concerned about this focus, which he and his colleagues viewed as misguided. To him, the young coders were nerdy outsiders just like he’d once been, albeit ones from privileged Ivy League and Silicon Valley backgrounds. They “reminded me of myself when I first got into computers,” he said. He thought he could mold them.\n\nIn particular, Dudek liked Bobba, who had a gentle air and a thick pile of dark hair that covered his forehead. Dudek had spent hours with Bobba, trying to get him to focus on concrete problems like how beneficiaries’ records were stored, often as cumbersome PDF and image files. Instead, Bobba, who did not respond to a request for comment, prioritized Musk’s quest to prove that dead people were receiving Social Security benefits.\n\nBobba had completed high school in New Jersey just three and a half years earlier. As a class speaker at his graduation, he’d encouraged his classmates not to ignore “nuance” and “complexity.” He’d lamented the “increasing willingness to simplify even the most complex narratives into sensational tidbits” like “280-character tweets,” which “perpetuates misinformation.”\n\nYet Dudek had barely settled in as commissioner when Bobba unintentionally sparked a national misinformation firestorm: A table he created appeared as a screenshot in a grossly misleading Musk tweet about “vampires” over the age of 100 allegedly collecting Social Security checks. Bobba had sorted people with a Social Security number by age and found more than 12 million over 120 years old still listed in the agency’s data.\n\nBobba said he knew these people weren’t actually receiving benefits and tried to tell Musk so, to no avail, according to SSA officials. Dudek watched in horror as Trump then shared the same statistics with both houses of Congress and a national television audience, claiming the numbers proved “shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors.” (The White House declined to comment on this episode. Bisignano, the new SSA commissioner, has repeatedlysaid that “the work that DOGE did was 100% accurate.”)\n\nInside the SSA, the DOGE team tried to find proof of the fraud that Musk and Trump had proclaimed, but it didn’t seem to know how to go about it, jumping from tactic to tactic. “It was a maelstrom of topic A to topic G to topic C to topic Q,” said a senior SSA official who was in the room. “Were we still helping anything by explaining stuff?” the official said. “It really wasn’t clear by that point.”\n\nDudek began to realize that the problem wasn’t primarily the people he called the “DOGE kids.” It was the senior leaders who were issuing orders without heeding what the young DOGErs were learning.\n\nDudek was perhaps the most favorably disposed to the outsiders. Plenty of agency officials were already put off by the DOGErs, who often issued peremptory orders to meet with them and answer questions.\n\nMichelle Kowalski, an analyst who has since departed the agency, was instructed to take one of the DOGE people, Cole Killian, through earnings data and historical records to analyze the cases of extremely old people whose deaths had not been recorded in Social Security data. She found herself having to explain to him, again and again, that many of these people were born before states reported births and deaths to the federal government and decades before the advent of electronic record keeping. In the early days of the agency, some people didn’t even know their birthdays.\n\nKowalski had assumed that Killian was middle-aged, since he was issuing instructions to her team. But he usually kept his camera turned off during video meetings. When he finally turned it on for one call, the face she saw seemed like that of a teenager.\n\nKillian was actually 24, just six years removed from performing “Hotel California” at his high school talent show at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School outside of Boston. (Killian, whose DOGE responsibilities also involved work at the Environmental Protection Agency, did not respond to a request for comment from ProPublica.)\n\nKowalski was exasperated by having to answer to such inexperience, even as so many of her colleagues were being pushed out the door by the Trump administration. She was not alone.\n\n“Many of us had actually believed in the marketed idea of genius technologists coming in to make things work better,” one senior SSA official said. But DOGE ended up being more interested, the official said, in “trying to prove that the Social Security Administration was entirely incompetent” than in suggesting improvements.\n\nEmployees at headquarters took their time walking past the glass-walled conference room where DOGE staffers had set up, glaring in at them as they worked among stacks of laptops that they used for assignments at different agencies. On a blog popular among SSA staffers, the mood in the comments section turned dark, with some anonymous posters identifying where in the building the “incel DOGE boys” were located and saying that “they are just warming up … just think what will come next.”\n\nDudek sensed the growing tension. He felt it, too. He’d been getting anonymous death threats mailed to his house. He decided to move the DOGE operatives to a more secluded area of the campus and assigned an armed security detail to protect them.\n\nDuring his first month as commissioner, Dudek ran his executive meetings in bombastic fashion, as if he were Trump on “The Apprentice.” And he sent out insulting full-staff emails pressuring career employees to retire. (Some 5,500 have left, with 1,500 more expected to follow.)\n\nDudek says this behavior stemmed partly from being in over his head, amazed by who he was suddenly answering to. “When the president of the United States asks you to do stuff,” he said, “you get caught up.”\n\nBut he also claims he was just performing a role. “Early on, I put on a persona of a yeller,” Dudek said. (Multiple longtime colleagues and friends noticed the change, they told ProPublica. As one put it, “There’s Lee, and then there’s Leland-performingly-Dudek.”)\n\nThis, he hoped, would convince the White House and DOGE of his commitment, which could in turn give him credibility as he kept trying to push them toward the real issues at Social Security.\n\nBut the Trump administration kept having other plans. Its demands usually came through Coulter, the DOGE lead with the Harvard and hedge fund background, who early on dropped by Dudek’s office unannounced multiple times a week, Dudek said.\n\n“I really think it would be helpful if you were to do this tomorrow,” Coulter would say to Dudek about eliminating an entire division of the SSA or cutting more staff, according to Dudek. To him, these suggestions felt like orders. If he responded, “I don’t know, let me think about it,” Coulter would call a few hours later on the encrypted-messaging app Signal to ask, “You really aren’t catching on, are you?” and “Do you know how many times I’ve defended you?”\n\n“I was supposed to get the message — and it would be ‘my own decision,’ so I’d be stuck with it,” Dudek said. “He can say he never told me to do anything.” (Coulter, who has been working for DOGE at NASA in recent months, did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nOne of Coulter’s suggestions involved the SSA’s Office of Transformation, which had been doing the seemingly DOGE-like work of developing an online application to replace many of the agency’s paper-based forms and in-person interviews. The office had been working with elderly, low-income and disabled people to see what most confused them about SSA processes and what would most help them if these were redesigned.\n\nBut instead of facilitating this effort at greater efficiency, Coulter told Dudek to close the office, according to Dudek, claiming it was wasteful. Agency staff joked that DOGE shut it down because its name included a word that began with “trans.”\n\nDudek and his colleagues sometimes attempted to co-opt DOGE’s obsessions in the hope that they could address a genuine problem at the agency. This strategy was not successful.\n\nSuch was the case with the issue of phone fraud. Knowing that the DOGErs would perk up at the mention of anything fraud-related, Dudek and other officials made a point of explaining that they’d been working on an initiative to block bots that had been calling the agency. The bots would impersonate beneficiaries, using dates of birth and other information that can be found on the internet, to try to change the beneficiaries’ bank-routing information and steal their benefits.\n\nIn 2024, Dudek had been on a team that spearheaded an effort to combat this type of fraud. The plans included running all phone-based requests for bank account changes against a Treasury Department database of suspicious accounts and analyzing such calls to verify whether they were being made from the vicinity of the address on file of the person purportedly calling.\n\nDOGE ignored the proposed solutions. Instead, the White House instructed Dudek to end all claims and direct-deposit transactions by phone. Beneficiaries would have to verify their own identities by using an often-confusing web portal or by traveling to a field office to do it in person. For millions of elderly or disabled people, these were daunting or impossible options.\n\nWhen this policy was rolled out at the end of March, beneficiaries panicked. Many flocked to field offices to preemptively provide proof of their identities even when they didn’t need to.\n\nBack at headquarters, in a weekly staff meeting, Dudek asked who could jump on the increasingly urgent task of making it easier to schedule field office appointments via the SSA website. “Well, Lee, you just fired that team,” one official answered, referring to the Office of Transformation. (Dudek said he asked this question on purpose to make sure DOGE heard the answer.)\n\nOver the course of six weeks under Dudek, the phone policy zigged and zagged a half dozen times — for example, the SSA adopted, then abandoned, a three-day waiting period to conduct an algorithmic fraud check on all calls — before finally ending up nearly where it began. Transactions could be carried out by phone again.\n\nThroughout this saga, Dudek was still getting calls from White House officials — most often from Katie Miller, DOGE’s spokesperson and the wife of Stephen Miller, one of Trump’s closest advisers. (Katie Miller went on to work for Musk before announcing plans to launch her own podcast. She did not respond to a request for comment.) Miller often called well into the evening, Dudek said, to chastise him about anything the press had reported that day that had caught the administration off guard.\n\nAs Dudek restored the phone policy to its pre-Trump version, Miller got angrier. “You changed the president’s policy,” she said, according to Dudek.\n\n“I’m like, ‘No, I’m still with the president’s policy,’” Dudek told Miller. But, if Social Security officials could implement the anti-fraud measures that he and his team had previously been planning, he said, they could “achieve the same end.” In that case, Dudek said, “we will do so and ease the friction point on the public.”\n\n“How dare you,” Miller said.\n\nIncreasingly dismayed, Dudek hatched a plan that seemed to embody his mix of good intentions, hubris and melodrama. He decided he would continue to play along with DOGE on the surface, in part so that Coulter and the other bigwigs would think he was still handling their business and thus spend less time at the agency. The younger DOGE team members, he said, were “easier to work with when their masters weren’t around.”\n\nBut behind the scenes, he began to undermine DOGE however he could. Sometimes he did this by making intemperate statements that he knew would find their way into the press and draw attention to what DOGE was asking him to do. “Have you ever worked with someone who’s manic-depressive?” he said of the Trump administration’s leadership in one meeting.\n\nOther times Dudek himself was the leaker. As commissioner, he was often an anonymous source for articles in The Washington Post and The New York Times. “If it was stupid stuff from the DOGE team, a lot of times I would go out to the press and immediately tattletale on myself so that it would blow up the next day,” Dudek said, adding that he did this in part to help Social Security advocates understand and bring attention to the growing crisis at the agency.\n\nRebecca Vallas, CEO of the nonprofit National Academy of Social Insurance, said she was in a one-on-one meeting with Dudek in March when he started getting calls from DOGE officials and the media. The calls were about his recent public comments claiming he might have to shut down the entire Social Security Administration if a federal judge continued to deny DOGE access to sensitive Social Security data. “He just let me sit there with the volume up high,” Vallas said.\n\nOn one of the calls, she said, someone told Dudek, “Elon loved that, but now it’s time to walk it back.” Afterward, Dudek told her, “I don’t know how we get out of this without hurting huge numbers of people. … I’m just trying to give advocates some ammunition.”\n\nDudek’s strategy was easier to pull off without DOGE catching on if it came off as the blundering of an amateur, he told ProPublica. In the most striking example, DOGE instructed Dudek to cancel two contracts that the SSA had with the state of Maine, according to Dudek and other SSA officials. The contracts, which all 50 states have long had versions of, allowed Maine to automatically report births and deaths to Social Security. Canceling them would impede government efficiency: Births and deaths in the state would take weeks or months longer to enter the federal system. That would likely cause benefits to continue to be sent to thousands of Mainers after they’ve died, exactly the kind of thing that Trump and Musk had been railing against.\n\nIt seemed clear to Dudek that he was being told to do this only because Trump was publicly feuding with Maine’s governor about transgender athletes. (The White House declined to comment on this episode.) So he decided to “write the hell out of” an email directing that the contracts be canceled. He did so in a way he thought would still earn him points with Trump and DOGE but that would, simultaneously, be so inflammatory that it would create a major storyline for reporters, advocates and Congress.\n\n“Please cancel the contracts,” Dudek’s email read. “While our improper payments will go up, and fraudsters may compromise identities, no money will go from the public trust to a petulant child.” That last phrase referred to Maine’s governor, Janet Mills, the one Trump had been fighting with. (“Do I care about Janet Mills? No,” Dudek told ProPublica.)\n\nAs Dudek had hoped, the press attention he generated compelled him to do what he already wanted to do: reinstate the contracts. In a written apology, he explained that he was only belatedly realizing the potential harm of what he (alone) had done. “I screwed up,” he told reporters. “I’m new at this job.”\n\nOnce again, Miller called Dudek and excoriated him. “What the hell is going on?” she said.\n\n“This place leaks like a sieve,” he answered. “What can I tell you?”\n\nLooking back on his tenure, Dudek maintains that his three months working alongside DOGE were not as harmful as they could have been, especially compared with what happened this spring at other federal agencies, some of which were essentially vaporized. Social Security checks, he points out, are still going out the door.\n\nStill, the SSA is reduced in his wake, with thousands fewer staff members to process claims and improve systems. These departed employees were disproportionately experienced and knowledgeable; they were the ones able to get other jobs or to retire with a pension. They took a lot of know-how with them.\n\nAnd the emotional harm that DOGE caused to older people and to people with disabilities — worsened by Dudek’s confusing actions — lingers. Many of these people have had money taken out of their paychecks their entire careers to pay for something more than just retirement benefits: security. It’s a feeling that may now be lost to them forever.\n\nIndeed, DOGE and Dudek caused so much consternation about the stability of the system that hundreds of thousands of people have filed early for retirement in recent months, even though doing so is not financially wise in the long term. The SSA must now pay out more in benefits than expected, contrary to DOGE’s cost-saving mission.\n\nDudek’s sister back in Saginaw, Ana Dudek, relies on Social Security disability benefits. “I would talk to my brother when he was commissioner and be like, dude, the decisions you’re making are causing people to feel terror,” she said. “Terror is an apt descriptor.”\n\nDudek acknowledges much of this. “I’m not a cold, callous son of a bitch, I really do get it,” he said. “I’ll forever be associated with the pain of DOGE. … But so much went on in such a short amount of time. I tried to make the best decisions I could given the circumstances.”\n\nSince being dismissed from the agency in June, Dudek has been struggling to find another job. “My name is mud,” he said. “It is as if I no longer exist.”\n\nAs a former SSA colleague put it, Dudek’s story is “the story of a disposable pawn, and there’s lots of those under Trump. They just used him, and then they disposed of him.”\n\nThe White House, presented with extensive questions for this article, sent a one-paragraph statement disparaging ProPublica and Dudek. ProPublica’s story, White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said, “is largely based around the comments of a disgruntled former employee who openly admitted to leaking to the media, manipulating his colleagues, and repeatedly telling lies from his official position. On his last day as Acting Commissioner, Leland Dudek showered praise upon President Trump in an op-ed and touted the ‘real results’ of the Social Security Administration, but now that he’s bitter about being out of the top job — he’s singing a different tune.”\n\nDudek said the administration asked him to write the op-ed and then vetted it. Referring to the litany of extravagant praise that cabinet secretaries lavished on Trump recently, he said, “you saw the cabinet meeting.”\n\nBisignano, the Social Security commissioner, comes to the role with a very different professional background than Dudek (though, like Dudek, he has working-class roots, in his case in Brooklyn). Until this job, Bisignano, 66, spent his career in the private sector. He was a top executive in operations and technology at massive banks like Citigroup and JPMorganChase and went on to become CEO of the payment processor Fiserv.\n\nYet, like DOGE, he appears to have embraced the appearance of efficiency rather than efficiency itself. He has repeatedly told staff that Social Security should be run more like Amazon, with AI handling more customer interactions. But disability claims are more complicated than ordering toothpaste, according to SSA officials and experts, and Social Security’s customer base is older and more likely to have an intellectual disability than the average Amazon Prime member.\n\nBisignano has also fixated on how much time it takes to reach an agent on the SSA’s 800 number. In a July press release, he claimed that the average was down to six minutes, an 80% reduction from 2024. He achieved this in part by reassigning 1,000 field office employees to phone duty. That means initial calls are getting answered faster, but there are significantly fewer staff members available to handle complex, in-person cases. And “reaching an agent” turns out to mean speaking to a human being — or an AI bot. Internal SSA statistics obtained by ProPublica reveal that Bisignano’s estimate treats cases in which beneficiaries interact with a chatbot and opt for a callback as “zero-minute” waits, skewing the average. If you actually stay on the line, USA Today has found, it often takes over an hour to reach a live representative.\n\nIn its statement, the SSA reiterated that call wait times have dramatically improved and that “using technology on our national 800 number has enabled 90 percent of calls handled to be served via automated self-service options or convenient callbacks.”\n\nEven the latest phone fraud policy feels like a rerun from DOGE’s earlier season. In late July, Bisignano’s team quietly posted a document to the Office of Management and Budget website stating that 3.4 million more people would have to go into field offices to verify their identities instead of being able to do so by phone, starting Aug. 18. Days later, the SSA announced that this was actually optional.\n\nThe DOGE era may officially be over at the agency, but the approach, it seems, is the same. As one SSA official put it, Bisignano is “doing all the same fundamentally inefficient things, more efficiently.”","summary":"by Eli Hager, for ProPublica\n\n\n\n\nOn Feb. 10, on the third floor of the Social Security Administration’s Baltimore-area headquarters, Leland Dudek unfurled a 4-foot-wide roll of paper that extended to 20 feet in length. It was a visual guide that the agency had kept for years to explain Social Security’s many technological systems and processes. The paper was covered in flow charts, arrows and text so minuscule you almost needed a magnifying glass to read it. Dudek called it Social Security’s “Dead Sea Scroll.”\n\n\n\n\nDudek and a fellow Social Security Administration bureaucrat taped the scroll across a wall of a windowless executive office. This was where a team from the new Department of Government Efficiency was going to set up shop.\n\n\n\nDOGE was already terrifying the federal bureaucracy with the prospect of mass job loss and intrusions into previously sacrosanct databases. Still, Dudek and a handful of his tech-oriented colleagues were hopeful: If any agency needed a dose of efficiency, it was theirs. “There ","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/9/9/2342424/-The-untold-saga-of-what-happened-when-DOGE-stormed-Social-Security?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1407391/story_image/AP25069014699313.jpg?1741642314","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-09 13:00:23","author":"Eli Hager,ProPublica","authors":["Eli Hager","ProPublica"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.234},{"id":358906692,"title":"Gen Z’s Radical Role Reversal: Women Want Careers, Men Want Children","text":"GenZ Goes to Work\n© Artem Peretiatko/iStock/Getty Images Plus\n\nA fresh NBC-commissioned study reveals a growing divergence in how Gen Z women and men view their paths forward—particularly when it comes to work, ambition, and the definition of success. While both groups value meaningful employment, their priorities around career progression, work-life balance, and financial security frequently diverge—shaping the next frontier in shaping and leading tomorrow’s workforce.”\n\nThe NBC News Decision Desk poll compares Gen Z men who voted for Trump and Gen Z women who voted for Harris (as well as the reverse) on what they consider essential to a successful life.\n\nThe data shows a sharp gender and political divide in priorities:\n\nMen (Trump voters) prioritize having children (34%), financial independence (33%), and being married (29%). Emotional stability is very low (9%).\n\nWomen (Harris voters) emphasize a fulfilling job/career (51%), having money to do things you want (46%), and emotional stability (39%). Marriage and children rank at just 6%.\n\nMen (Harris voters) prioritize fulfilling job and career at 54% and having money to do what they want at 42% Marriage and children rank at 11% and 9% respectively.\n\nWomen (Trump voters) prioritize financial independence 40% and job/career 32%, having children 26% and marriage much lower at 20%.\n\nIn America’s cultural imagination of the 1970s and 1980s, success for men and women was narrowly scripted. Men were expected to pursue careers, provide financial security, and maintain family stability. Women, despite gains from the women’s movement, were still pressured to prioritize marriage and children—even as they pushed for greater access to the workforce and higher education.\n\nHalf a century later, the roles appear to have flipped. This new NBC News poll reveals that Gen Z women—especially those who supported Vice President Kamala Harris in the last election—place the highest value on fulfilling careers, financial flexibility, and emotional stability. By contrast, Gen Z men—disproportionately aligned with Donald Trump—place greater importance on marriage, children, and traditional family life. It is a startling generational inversion.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nThe Trump–Harris Divide\n\nThe poll results underscore a truth I observe firsthand as a global women’s and corporate speaker, and best-selling author, engaging with young professionals: Gen Z women are increasingly independent-minded, career-focused, and unwilling to define their success solely in terms of family. Their overwhelming support for Kamala Harris reflects this ethos. Harris herself embodies the new trajectory: an accomplished lawyer, senator, and vice president who married later in life after building her career.\n\nOn the other side stands President Trump, and conservative podcasters like Joe Rogan, whose “masculine man” message appeals to a cohort of young men—predominantly white, but also at least 15-20% or more of Black and Latino men (with Latino men having a huge shift toward Trump in 2024 despite immigration issues being front and center)—who crave a return to a more traditional order. His political identity has become fused with the idea that manhood and success are defined by family formation, financial dominance, and control of the cultural narrative.\n\nThe Radical Role Reversal\n\nThis role reversal is radical not simply because men and women now prioritize different things, but because it reflects the collision of gender and politics. Gen Z women are not merely breaking with tradition—they are openly rejecting the June Cleaver archtype of their grandmothers’ 1950s era. Their vision of success is expansive: it includes careers, financial autonomy, and emotional well-being, with marriage and children as optional add-ons rather than defining markers.\n\nMeanwhile, tribal politics’ influence has galvanized a generation of young men toward older ideals. Having children, getting married, and securing financial independence rank among their highest values—even as their female peers redefine success in more individualistic, career-first terms.\n\nWhat leaps off the page in the NBC data is how independence dominates Gen Z’s definition of success—with one striking exception. For Harris-aligned men and women, autonomy and self-direction ranked first, while marriage and children fell to the bottom of their lists. Even Trump-supporting women, though more traditional than their Harris-leaning peers, still placed independence near the top while elevating family into their upper tier. Only Trump-supporting men broke the pattern, putting family formation above autonomy. The throughline is unmistakable: across most of Gen Z, freedom to chart your own course—not marital or parental status—has become the clearest marker of success.\n\nWhy This Matters for Business and Society\n\nFor leaders and employers, these shifting priorities carry real consequences. The future workplace must adapt to a talent pool where Gen Z women—the most educated female cohort in American history—will not tolerate outdated barriers to advancement or rigid definitions of success. They will demand flexibility, purpose-driven work, and inclusive cultures that honor their autonomy.\n\nAt the same time, companies cannot ignore the significant share of young men who value stability, marriage, and family. Understanding these divergent perspectives is essential for building workplaces that can both attract and retain talent across the gender spectrum.\n\nA New American Narrative\n\nWhat this poll ultimately reveals is not just a divide between men and women, but two competing visions of freedom. Trump’s America looks backward—toward a gender order where men lead families and women follow. Harris’s America looks forward—toward a redefinition of success that allows women to ascend to the presidency, to lead corporations, to marry later if at all, and to live on their own terms.\n\nAs America approaches its 250th anniversary next July 4, 2026, Gen Z is showing us that the meaning of success is being radically rewritten. Women are chasing careers. Men are prioritizing family. And the tug-of-war between these visions will shape not only the workplace of the future but the soul of the nation itself. There is some good news for Gen Z women and men alike, because they do seem to share an ethos, or Gen Z ethos (purpose, autonomy, wellness):\n\n3 Things Gen Z Men and Women Agree On:\n\nWork Must Be Fulfilling\n\nA career isn’t just a paycheck — it has to align with purpose and passions.\n\nIndependence Is Essential\n\nWhether defined as financial freedom or autonomy in life choices, Gen Z sees control over their path as non-negotiable.\n\nWell-Being Matters\n\nEmotional and mental health are increasingly seen as part of real success, not an afterthought.\n\nAs an aging Gen Xer who has two nieces in this Gen Z cohort, I am excited for their unlimited future and possibilities as bi-racial women in America. They will have opportunities that my generation of doctors, lawyers, engineers, educators, scientists, and politicians helped to forge, as trailblazers. But they too will be blazing a new pathway for the women that come after them--one of financial independence, vast personal freedom, and lots of choices about when and how they want to marry or start a family.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"New NBC polling shows Gen Z women overall prioritize careers and independence, while Gen Z men lean into marriage—reshaping generational definitions of family and success.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sophianelson/2025/09/09/gen-zs-radical-role-reversal-women-want-careers-men-want-children/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68c01ffcb6eff3ab6cad0fdd/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-09 12:59:37","author":"Contributor,Sophia A.

Our country is at a crossroads and it’s vital that our state have a leader who will lead California into the future.” Villaraigosa said he was honored to have Bass' support, describing the mayor as \"a fierce advocate for working families, children, seniors, and underserved communities and a tireless champion for social and economic justice and for the people of Los Angeles.\" The race to replace termed-out Gov. Gavin Newsom has drawn a crowded field of contenders with notable credentials. In addition to Villaraigosa, who served as Los Angeles' mayor for eight years, other prominent candidates include former Rep. Katie Porter of Irvine, former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, former state legislative leader Toni Atkins, current state Supt. of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, former state Controller Betty Yee, wealthy businessman Stephen Cloobeck, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and conservative commentator Steve Hilton. After former Vice President Kamala Harris opted against entering the gubernatorial race, independent polling has found that Porter and Bianco have a narrow edge in the 2026 contest. But much could happen in the eight months before the June primary. Politically active Californians are largely focused on the November special election about redrawing California's congressional districts. Despite being the Democratic leader of the nation's second-largest city in an overwhelmingly blue state and a veteran congresswoman, it's unclear how much weight Bass' endorsement will have in the governor's race. Her favorability ratings have dropped since she was elected mayor in 2022. Shortly before Bass won the mayoral contest, 50% of Los Angeles voters had a favorable opinion of her, according to a UC Berkeley/Los Angeles Times poll. In April, after wildfires ravaged the area, 50% had an unfavorable view of her. However, Bass' reputation may have rebounded as she vigorously defended the city during federal immigration raids this summer. Bass has known Villaraigosa, a former two-term Los Angeles mayor and legislative leader, for more than half a century. They met as community activists in the 1970s, focused on issues such as the drug epidemic, police accountability and poverty. They have long supported each other's political pursuits. Villaraigosa was an early backer of Bass' 2022 mayoral campaign and served on her mayoral transition team. Bass is scheduled to publicly endorse Villaraigosa on Tuesday morning outside of the Los Angeles Sentinel, a Black-owned weekly newspaper. Los Angeles City Council President Marqueece Harris Dawson, Councilwoman Heather Hutt, Long Beach Mayor Rex Richardson, Inglewood City Councilwoman Dionne Faulk and South Los Angeles religious leaders are also expected to attend. The city's Black voters were part of the coalition Villaraigosa built that won him the mayor's race in 2005. \"I understood from an early age that much of the success that I have had is on the backs of the civil rights movement,” Villaraigosa told the Sentinel in 2022.

Unfavorable views of the party seem to keep rising with every passing month of President Donald Trump’s second term and that discontent has reached a new height this summer. More than 60 percent of American adults view the Democrats with derision, according to weekly tracking polls conducted by YouGov.\nLooking at this another way, positive views of the Democratic Party have now crumbled to a historic low, with only about one-third of the country seeing them in a good light, per Wall Street Journal polling that shook the political world in July.\nIt’s a broad-based dislike: Republicans, independents, and disaffected Democrats are dragging down the party’s brand. But the reasons for this dislike are varied. Since there’s no one explanation for why everyone seems to hate the Democrats right now, it’s useful to break this question up into a few charts to visualize the complicated position of the Democratic Party in 2025.\nDemocrats are frustrated with their party\nThe biggest contributor to the negative position of the Democratic Party right now comes from depressed Democrats who are frustrated with their party. Poll after poll shows a unique, historically unusual dynamic where Republicans are very satisfied with the state and performance of their political party while Democrats are significantly less happy with their own side.\nA summer Gallup poll summed up this development: 91 percent of Republicans have a favorable opinion of the GOP — up from 87 percent in October 2024 — while 73 percent of Democrats have a favorable opinion of their party — down from 92 percent in 2024. It’s a highly unusual dynamic, Gallup notes; Republicans tend to be more unfavorable toward their party, so this unity is surprising. Democrats, meanwhile, historically tend to be more supportive of their party.\nThe first way to think of this difference is to see the associations that Democrats have with their party. For most of the last year, Democratic voters were sending signals to their leaders that they wanted more aggressive resistance and opposition to Trump — something they feel like their party is not doing well.\nConsider this chart with responses to a prompt from an August Associated Press-NORC poll. Per AP, one-third of Democrats have negative views of their party, largely to do with the party’s inability to respond to Trump.\n“Weak,” “tepid,” “ineffective,” and “broken,” came up the most among Democrats and were used by Democrats to describe their party much more frequently than by Americans in general.\n[Media: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/c7rnk/2/]\nIn other words, Democrats dislike their party because they think they are incapable of resisting Trump; other Americans dislike the party for other reasons. This matches other trends. Pew Research Center data from this spring showed an overwhelming majority of Democrats thought it was “extremely” or “very” important that their leaders resist Trump and his policies. That was most pronounced among very liberal Democrats, 85 percent of whom said this resistance was “extremely” important — higher than the response from liberal, conservative, or moderate Democrats. And polling from Strength In Numbers/VeraSight suggests that this cohort of very liberal/progressive Democrats might be the Americans bringing down the party’s favorability at the moment.\nDemocrats are divided on what direction their party should go\nIdeologically, there’s evidence that the party’s negative perceptions are motivated, in part, by its members not being united on what direction their party should go. After many pre- and post-election surveys found that Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party suffered from being viewed as too radical or too liberal, discussions within the party centered on whether the party needed to ideologically change direction.\nGallup studied this question earlier in the year and found mixed results, but definitive significant changes from four years ago. Democrats, and Democratic-leaning independents, are divided over whether the party should change or not.\n[Media: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zP7kv/2/]\nMore of these partisans want the party to be more moderate than in 2021, but a majority would still prefer it stay the same or move left. This, again, matches trends in other polls and correlates with surveys finding that a majority of Americans think their party is “somewhat” or “very” divided, while Democrats themselves are split in half on that question. Dislike of a political party flows from there. If you think your party should moderate, but is not, you’ll probably be upset at it overall. If you think the party should be more liberal, but it’s not, the same reasoning applies. Republicans, meanwhile, are pretty happy with their party right now: 43 percent think the party should not change. \nAmericans, and Democrats, really dislike Democratic party leaders\nRelatedly, a third way to visualize this dislike for the Democratic Party is to see it as a reflection of the unpopularity of its leaders. If the party base, and American voters in general, have strong negative feelings about a party’s elite — those spokespeople who stand in for and speak for the party — then it makes sense for those feelings to be applied to the party in general.\nHere, Elliot Morris’s Strength in Numbers analysis of favorability of political figures is clear. While most politicians and figures are unpopular, Democratic ones are especially unpopular.\n[Media: https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Atiel/2/]\nA similar dynamic emerges when looking at Democrats in Congress. They are viewed much more negatively in general by their own voters than Republicans are by their own voters. Meanwhile, individual Democratic representatives and Democratic candidates tend to be viewed more favorably than Democrats as a whole or Republican candidates and the Republican Party. \nThis suggests some degree of voters not wanting to throw the baby out with the bathwater. They like individual Democratic representatives while disliking party leadership and the party brand. This would also explain why Democrats continue to see a modest advantage on the generic congressional ballot — voters are still more likely to vote for a Democrat in next year’s midterm elections, even if they dislike the party as a whole. \nIn addition to these three buckets of explanations, there are some more natural dynamics at play: Partisanship and polarization explain why Republicans still strongly dislike the Democratic Party, while it’s normal for a political party to go through a period of wandering in the wilderness after a presidential loss (Democrats were in a similar polling position in 2017 before surging in the fall into 2018). So while Democrats seem to be hated by everyone right now, they aren’t doomed yet.","summary":"If there’s one thing a large majority of Americans have consistently agreed on this year, it’s that the Democratic Party sucks.

Most of that time, he’s discussing and reacting to the news. And during President Trump’s second term, there’s plenty of that to go around.\nOf course, Piker isn’t speaking into the void. He has nearly 3 million followers on Twitch and has hosted conversations with Senator Bernie Sanders and US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He claims his election night stream in 2024 reached a staggering 7.5 million viewers. On this episode of Big Interview, I talked to Piker about his looks, his love of Italian sandwiches, and any future political aspirations he might (or might not) want to tease.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nKATIE DRUMMOND: Hello, Hasan.\nHASAN PIKER: Hi. It's great to be here.\nI heard you were just at the gym. How was that?\nYeah, I was at the park. Some days I take my dog and I play a little bit of basketball and get to hang out with some people. See what the normies are talking about.\nWhat were they talking about today?\nWe talk a lot about Israel. I feel like a lot of normies, at least that I hang out with, they oftentimes will be talking about foreign policy, which is surprising and unexpected for sure.\nBut other than that, not much. The other day it was about something silly. Trump was on the roof of the White House, and that was like a big deal for some people. I just don't really understand why.\nI think it was a big deal on the internet because it was a very funny picture.\nIt was a funny picture.\nSo look, we always start these conversations with some very fast questions to warm up. Are you ready?\n\nWhat was your first online screen name?\nOh my God. Uh, it was Hasso Fadir. It was like “Hasan father,” but in a Turkish way of saying “father” in English.\nIt's not the Turkish word for “father,” because that's baba, but it was spelled out in the way that a Turkish person would say “father.”\nMine was Miss Pickle. What’s the first piece of tech you use after you wake up?\n\nLast piece of tech you look at before you go to bed.\nStill my phone.\nLast text message you sent.\nLet's see. It was to my friend Emma Vigeland. She's cohost of The Majority Report who said, “You're gonna be in Chicago?? Let's collaborate. I fly out tonight.” I said, “Same.”\nAre you gonna collaborate?\n\nAll right. What's your favorite sandwich?\nThat's a tough one because I love all of them. I would say a New Jersey sub from this institution called Sorrento’s around Freehold. A Number 14, which is a combination, I believe, of like Number 7 and Number 12. [Eds. note: Sorrento’s menu says the Number 14 is a combo of a Number 5 and a Number 12 called the Pig Special.] So an Italian sub from a real New Jersey institution, and if not that, then a Wawa Club sandwich.\nI really appreciate how specific that was. Thank you. First video game you ever bought?\nI pirated a lot because I was in Turkey growing up, so it was virtually impossible for us to get like a lot of video games. As far as purchase, it could be Metal Gear Solid 2 for the PlayStation 2, or I guess a Pokémon game.\nSo let’s rewind 34 years. You were born in New Jersey. You spent the majority of your childhood in Turkey.\n\nYou've talked before about that upbringing. You've characterized it as a very privileged one. How did that experience, now that you're able to look back and reflect, affect your worldview? How does that turn you into the person that you are today?\nThere’s massive income inequality in Turkey that almost resembles America now, but that’s still far worse in Turkey. For that reason, if you’re above board, if you’re relatively affluent, you come across as very wealthy in comparison to the average person.\nI’ve never sheltered people from that truth, but I did grow up fairly affluent. It was very positive in the sense that I didn’t have to worry about making ends meet or having to take on a job or anything like that. My parents’ main concern was to make sure that I wasn't spoiled, so I didn't get everything I wanted.\nOutside of that, I would say that as a young boy I was sent to public school in Turkey. I think it was a good thing that my parents did that because it made me understand that there were very different income brackets with people living in very different conditions.\nYou moved to the United States for college, right? What was surprising to you about that transition?\nWhen I came to college, this is literally what I wanted. Other people were like, “I want to be an astronaut,” “I want to be a teacher,” “I want to be a race car driver.” I was like, “I want to go to college in America.”\nSo I loved it. I was so stoked to be here, and I had all of these beliefs. You know, this is a land of freedom, land of prosperity, right?\n\nThis is where I’m gonna make a name for myself, make a career for myself.\nSlowly but surely, experiences growing up or going to college and then onwards living in America, slowly chipped away at that dream. Piece by piece.\n\nIt’s interesting because in comparison to other fresh-off-the-boat immigrant stories, I did it. I am living the American dream, but I just realized that it’s not something that is readily accessible for all.\nIn my job running WIRED—and especially running WIRED since Trump was reelected—I worry about my family’s safety and well-being. Obviously I worry about my staff. Do you worry about your family given the high-profile nature of your job and how outspoken you are?\nOh, yeah. All the time. But it's not new.\nYeah, sure.\nIt’s not new for me. For two reasons. One, because if you’ve been a visible figure on the left and you’ve been a commentator on the left online, no matter what size you are, you’ve experienced doxing and death threats. This is something that is just in the backdrop at this point in my career. I’ve been taking it on the chin for stuff like this since 2014.\nThe other reason why I say I’m used to it is because I’m Turkish, and the Turkish government is very restrictive with what you can and can’t say. In the past, I’ve been directly called up and threatened by the Turkish government for an article I wrote for the Huffington Post about the coup.\n\n[They] demanded that I write another one that was in favor of Turkey. I didn’t do it. But because my whole family still lives in Turkey, that is still very much a threat.\nI have enough privilege and enough money to be able to defend my family and myself against such things. There are so many people who are defenseless, who get swept away in the process. So I try to speak for them to the best of my ability.\nWhat does your family think about what you do?\nThey like it. They weren’t big fans of it at first. They didn’t fully understand what it was. By the time I started taking care of them financially, they were just like, “Alright, it’s fine.”\nI’m the black sheep of my family. I’m the only one with an undergraduate degree only. My dad and my mom both have PhDs. My brother has a master’s in engineering. So they’re all very credentialed. My dad used to always tell me, “When are you going to go back to school? When are you going to get a PhD? When are you going to get a real job?” Those phone calls stopped at a certain point, and I would say that's after I started financially taking care of the whole family.\nBack in May, you were detained coming back into the United States. You then shared that your Global Entry credential was revoked by the Department of Homeland Security. You’ve been targeted before, but that felt categorically new and different.\nOh, for sure.\nDo you feel safe living and working in the United States right now?\nI mean, yes and no. I feel safer than I would in many other parts of the world still, right?\n\nBut having said that, I certainly don't feel as safe as I did 10 years ago or five years ago. Because there's a difference, I think, with right-wing, neo-Nazi circuits coming after you versus the actual federal government actively putting a target on your back. I think that is definitely a little bit more terrifying because when they do it, it's legal, right?\n\nAs someone who has seen what that looks like in Turkey, this is definitely a scary predicament. My family certainly thinks so, and they don't want me to continue doing it in America, but I'm too stubborn to leave.\nI'm gonna pivot a little bit. What drew you to Twitch in the first place? You were on YouTube, right?\nI was on YouTube for the Young Turks.\nYes, right.\nI was on Facebook primarily for the Young Turks as well. But I wanted to make my own thing, I wanted to make my own community and have a place that I could go and have it as my own thing. I play video games already, so I was like, you know what? I'm playing a lot of Fortnite—might as well maximize this time. I was playing with a bunch of other content creators, a bunch of other journalists and podcasters.\n\nSo I was already playing Fortnite with those guys and shooting the shit, talking politics. Anyway, I might as well strap a camera to my PlayStation 4 and just go live on Twitch. That's precisely what I did for like the first couple of months. Then I upgraded it.\nI don't watch you for six to nine hours a day because I have a job, but I've seen enough to know that this is an endurance sport. How much of this is planned ahead of time and how much of this is just freewheeling and seeing where those nine hours take you?\nIt's a bit of both. I have a skeleton in mind for what I'm going to talk about every single day. There's top-level stories that I'm definitely interested in getting to, and for that reason I'll have an idea of what I'm definitely going to cover.\n\nBut throughout the day as events unfold, of course, I don't have all my talking points readily assigned ahead of time, and there's definitely a much more open communication format that I have in my chat.\nWhat do you read, listen to, and watch? What’s your news diet in 2025?\nEverything. From TikTok to, unfortunately, Twitter, even though Twitter is bad and insanely unreliable for that purpose. Twitter used to be my primary way to just download the news, and it's gone. It doesn't function in that way anymore.\nAs far as mainstream publications go, it’s NPR, The New York Times, CNN, NBC, everything.\nHow much do you worry about context? You're streaming for hours and hours a day, days on end. You are talking about, often, very contentious subjects, right? Your words can be taken out of context very easily.\nAnd they are.\nHow much do you try to control or redirect that narrative versus just logging on the next day and doing your thing and just letting it run?\nI used to try and take control over that narrative quite a bit.\nDid it work?\nI realized that that was probably a mistake. Because a lot of people that do that are doing that maliciously, like they are not genuinely interested in offering constructive criticism or genuinely interested in addressing a misunderstanding. In most circumstances they're just doing that specifically so they can professionally misunderstand you and present your position as the exact opposite in many instances.\nThere's an entire cottage industry dedicated to doing that. I think I offered it a lot of legitimacy by responding and being like, “Hey guys, no, you got this wrong. This is what I actually meant.”\nIn that process I realized that a lot of those same people would just turn around and make more content off that response, where they would be like, “Oh, he’s having a hard time coping,” or they wouldn't believe me.\n\nI encompassed this broad range of ideology that they despise, and became like a figurehead that they could attack to basically position themselves as against the left without openly saying that they’re against the left.\nSo you have your detractors, but you also have a lot of fans. Why do you think people like you?\nI communicate the anger that they feel in their hearts about the way that the system is designed.\nSome people say, it’s because [I’m] attractive. “It’s your looks” or whatever. I'm like, “Thank you for saying that. That's very nice of you.” But I think it's mostly because I try to fill the role other commentators filled for me when I was growing up as a young boy, interested in politics, interested in American politics in particular, when I saw people like Jon Stewart or like political satirists that I read in Turkey who helped me understand the world a little bit better.\n\nSo, in a lot of ways, I try to be an antidote to the unimaginable faucet of reactionary content that you see online to the best of my ability, which, like I said, draws a lot of enmity from these very successful corners of the internet.\nI wanna ask you about the Democrats. I want to ask you about the idea that has been floating around since Trump won, that they have to find their Joe Rogan. I saw an interview you did recently where I think you said something like, the Democrats don’t need their own Joe Rogan, they need better policies.\nYeah, that's the thing that I’ve consistently stated over and over again, which seemingly no one hears for some reason. It’s just like, you can't podcast your way out of this problem.\nTalk to us a little bit more about the problem as you see it.\nThe Democrats don’t just have a marketing problem. The Democrats are just a bad political party. When I say that, I don't mean evil in the same way that the Republicans are an evil political party. Right? Republicans have bad policy, but good politics.\n\nWhat I mean by that is they are very good at utilizing the political machine, setting up wedge issues, really hammering in those wedge issues in an effort to create some kind of mobilization or momentum around a legislative agenda.\nThat is horrifying. That’s the bad policy. Democrats, on the other hand, are supposed to have good policy and bad politics, but they don’t even have good policy. They have bad policy and bad politics, so when I say they’re bad at their jobs, they're bad at being the counterbalance to growing fascism in this country. They’re bad at being the opposition party.\n\nThey’re not defined by a couple key signature policies that everyone could champion. Medicare for all is a great example of this. Free college is another one.\nObviously, focusing on the cost of living crisis that Americans are facing right now is what Trump did, at least when he was campaigning.\n\nClearly, he is not invested in fixing that at all, but at least he campaigned on that.\nTrump was even able to campaign as somewhat of an anti-war figure as opposed to Kamala Harris, which is so crazy to me.\nCrazy because that’s not true. That was never going to be true. But the only reason people were foolish enough to believe him is because the Democrats were actively messaging that they were going to continue death and destruction. Kamala said she was going to be responsible for the most lethal military in American history at the DNC. That's not a thing that any Democrat should ever say.\nLet me ask you this. You can snap your fingers and get the Democrats out of the mess that they've created for themselves …\n\n… get the GOP outta the White House in 2028. What has to happen? What is the revolutionary change that transforms this very hopeless dynamic that I think a lot of people are feeling right now?\nEveryone behaves like [New York City mayoral candidate] Zohran Mamdani, like everyone get more radical now. I’m not even alone on this. White, liberal wine moms are demanding that Hakeem Jeffries put his body on the line to stop these deportations, to stop these mass firings taking place at federal regulatory agencies.\nWe need to start putting labor first. We need to start putting the working class first and foremost.\nIf the Democrats don’t do that, cynical Republicans will take advantage of the void that the Democrats leave in the media to present themselves as the actual populists, because they do that all the time. Trump did that.\n\nTrump said, I’m not cutting Medicaid, I’m not cutting Medicare. I’m not touching any of that. Not touching Social Security. Then $800 billion in cuts to Medicaid coming after this new tax cuts for the wealthy package, the [“One Big Beautiful Bill”] that he passed. The very fact that he ran on not doing that thing that he’s now doing still means that they recognize that left populist messaging is very valuable.\nI’ll give you another example: Israel. Eight percent of Democrat voters say they like what Israel is doing. Yet, if you were to look at the Democratic party’s politicians, if you were to look at the organs of media, you would assume that everyone is on board with what Israel is doing. Or maybe a little bit critical about it. Every now and then a little bit of condemnation here and there. That’s not reflective of the anger that people have in their hearts for this barbaric campaign of death and destruction.\nSo someone’s gonna take advantage of that. Who’s taking advantage of that void in discourse? Tucker Carlson. Who’s taking advantage of that void in leadership? Marjorie Taylor Greene. People who have their ear to the ground who understand that this issue will get them tremendous support.\nWhat does the US in 2025 under Trump look like to you? What words would you use and what do you think that Americans don’t understand adequately, or maybe don’t understand yet about living in a country where democracy is a question mark and not a sure thing anymore?\nI’ve never thought that we’ve had a true democratic process anyway, because of the issues that I brought up about health care and whatnot. These are things that people want and yet they never seem to get them, right? That's a part of the reason why I think the liberal democratic process that we have here in America and in many other Western countries is simply a pressure valve to make people feel like they participate in this process, to make people feel like their voice is heard to a certain degree so they don’t revolt.\nBecause countries that have more quote-unquote authoritarian means of governance are constantly susceptible to rebellion. Whereas I think liberal democracy has that pressure valve so that people just go, “Well, I voted, I did my thing.” And we still have the democratic process here. Like our voices are still heard.\n\nNow I feel like that’s falling apart. But I think the apt comparison of 2025 America is the dissolution of the USSR, because it was death by a thousand cuts. But I think the USSR ultimately engaged in self-destruction, where numerous Western-affiliated and connected officials—there were high-ranking government officials basically picking apart the carcass of the state for profit as they recognized that liberalization was coming—took advantage of this. As a means to increase their wealth and power. The Russian Federation is run by those guys, the oligarchs.\nThat's kind of what we're doing here as well. It is a self-inflicted wound born out of just pure greed with no counterbalance whatsoever. No alternative vision for where society could evolve towards. I think a lot of people have succumbed to nihilism for understandable reasons, because they feel like their voices are not heard.\nSo they try to keep going by engaging in commodity consumption and watching movies and watching TikTok clips and just trying to make ends meet. And then hopefully feel a semblance of humanity in the very few moments that they have to themselves.\nThis is not a gotcha question, it’s genuinely something that I think about and grapple with. WIRED publishes on Facebook, we rely on Google search. We’re intertwined with all of these technology companies, and we cover them on a daily basis. You publish on Twitch; you don’t own and control that platform. It’s ultimately owned by Amazon. You publish on Instagram, which is owned by Meta.\n\nIt has not always been a smooth road for you at Twitch. You were banned for a period, I think 24 hours, a couple months ago. What are the interactions like with the platform, and have you ever thought about standing something up that would give you more independence?\nIt’s certainly something that I’ve thought about, but unfortunately my job as a communicator is to be as accessible as possible.\n\nOutside of the numerous complications of launching an initiative such as that one, it would also be impossible to do so without using AWS. So then you go back to Amazon.\nAs a political commentator that is outside of the political duopoly that exists in this country, I’m always thinking about the threat of deplatforming, right?\n\nThe reality of the matter is I just have to play ball with these big corporations to a certain degree because I still do generate a lot of revenue for them. So I think that is the value that I bring to the table. Not only do I generate a lot of revenue for them, I generate a lot of positive marketing for them. Because if all of the top content creators were just little creatures that were constantly saying insanely toxic things and insanely hateful things, I think advertisers would probably not like that as much.\nWhat do you make of the conversations about your appearance? I looked at your Instagram. Hasan, you are shirtless often. So you seem to embrace this part of your fandom, this part of the conversation.\nI mean, I’m just who I am, right? I don't do it as a marketing technique or whatever. I grew up very fat, so once I was able to lose this weight and achieve certain goals that I had set for myself fitness-wise, I wanted to influence others to also be able to do the same and to lead healthy lives.\nBut I’m sure that there’s plenty of people who go, “That dude is hot,” and thank you. I’ll take it.\nBut the thing is with The New York Times [story], I don’t think The New York Times is ever going to do that because like my politics are, especially when it comes to foreign policy, fairly antagonistic …\n\n… to The New York Times. And while there are incredible journalists there, some of them are my very good friends who work tirelessly to try to break certain stories and maybe even get pushback. I think this is basically a way for some people to just try to get me more mainstream prominence.\n\nSo I’ll take it. I was on Time’s 100 Most Influential list recently. I call it terrorism insurance because there are always a lot of publications, far-right publications, that are actively trying to get me deplatformed.\nSo when I have these sorts of media opportunities, I take them because it makes those guys look silly.\nYou’re talking about strategic positioning, which brings me to my last question. You’ve been doing this for 12 years. That is a long fucking time to be streaming on the internet. What do you envision for the next phase of your career?\nI don’t see myself doing anything other than this anytime soon. I love this. I’m a very stubborn person, and I don't take for granted the fortune that I’ve had.\nDo you think about running for office?\n\nNever, never.\nWell, you have a big platform and strongly held views, so it doesn’t not make sense.\nBut there is no media ecosystem that would prop someone like myself up.\nOK. I’ll check back in with you in 20 years. Now, we’re gonna play a really quick game. It’s called Control, Alt, Delete. I want to know what piece of tech would you love to control? What piece would you alt, so alter or change, and what would you delete? What would you vanquish from the earth if given the opportunity?\nDelete all of the LLMs, all of them gone. No more AI, no more fucking language models. Bye-bye. No more. Bye-bye to all the image generator things that are just destroying the planet so that people can have those yellow-hue, gross AI images that they can churn out. Done. That’s easy.\n\nAs far as control, I would control TikTok. That's what I would control.\nWhat would you do with that?\nI would control TikTok to turn it into the pro-socialist, anti-imperialist propaganda apparatus that every boomer parent thinks it is. Be like, “Oh, you got a septum piercing and you’re talking about how rent must be abolished?” Boom. A hundred thousand likes, you’re in front of every wine mom.\nThis is a good answer. Alt?\nAlter Twitter. Bring woke back. That’s what I would do. Bring woke Twitter back.\nI’d rather be canceled a million times for, I don’t know, saying something that someone perceived as remotely ableist or something. I’d rather be canceled every day than have to fucking deal with the neo-Nazis posting Adolf Hitler fan cams and getting hundreds of thousands of likes.\nIt’s not even just that. It’s just like all bots. My feed is filled to the brim with the worst videos of all time. Not just violent ones, just really stupid ones.\nYou know what I did with my account is I deleted it so that I don't have to look at it anymore.\nI can’t do that, because unfortunately it’s a primary mode of communication for an international consortium of journalists. Like, I talk to reporters in Gaza on this platform. There's no other alternative out there that I can use. It sucks.\n\nHow to Listen\nYou can always listen to this week's podcast through the audio player on this page, but if you want to subscribe for free to get every episode, here's how:\nIf you're on an iPhone or iPad, open the app called Podcasts, or just tap this link.

It started in 2020, when he received his first bonus as an investment banker. It was more money than he was used to. He wanted to invest in real estate, so he called his cousin, a research analyst at BlackRock, for advice.\n\nAs they talked over options, his cousin showed him a striking chart of the number of \"housing starts\" in the U.S. since 1950 (basically the number of new houses and apartments built each year). It showed that the last 10 years had the fewest starts since the 1960s, even though the U.S. population was now much larger.\n\nIt was a full decade of underinvestment. They focused on single-family homes — the classic house with a yard, often in the suburbs.\n\n\"I'm a millennial,\" says Erb. \"I've always envisioned having a home.\" But none of his friends had bought a house yet. Neither had he. Contemplating this lack of new houses and rising demand from millennials like him, he saw \"a big opportunity … something that I was willing to spend my career on.\"\n\nSo Erb and his cousin raised money from investors, bought homes in places like the Chatham-Arch neighborhood in Indianapolis (which was affordable, had a growing population and was benefiting from redevelopment), and rented them out — presumably to people who wanted a house with a yard but couldn't afford to buy one. Erb says it was a profitable business.\n\nHe was not the first New York finance person to profit from single-family rentals across the United States. The private equity firm Blackstone (commonly confused with BlackRock) more or less invented this buy-to-rent strategy in 2012, under the moniker Invitation Homes. It's now a public company valued at more than $18 billion.\n\nThe response to this development — of Wall Street buying Main Street, or at least some of its cul-de-sacs — has been bipartisan, populist and patriotic condemnation. Both JD Vance and Kamala Harris called for bans on these corporate landlords. Since houses tend to rise in value over time, homeownership has been a primary way that middle-class families build wealth. But now private equity was outbidding aspiring homeowners, making it more expensive to buy a home and pocketing the appreciation in home values.\n\nEven some of Erb's friends told him they thought he was making homes unaffordable. \"Nothing that has stuck with me or made me second-guess what I'm doing,\" he says. He wasn't responsible for the decade of underinvestment; he felt they were giving young couples the option to live in a house without breaking their bank account. \"But, yeah, very emotional conversations.\"\n\nNow that these institutional investors have been buying and renting out houses for more than a decade, researchers have had time to study their impact. And they've found a surprising nuance.\n\nThese investors can and do make homeownership harder to attain, just as their critics claim. But by providing rentals, they also make neighborhoods more affordable and more diverse. They are diversifying the suburbs.\n\nThe big bang of buy-to-rent\n\nWhen institutional investors first started buying single-family homes, the U.S. government laid out the welcome mat.\n\nBefore the Great Recession, major investors hadn't had much interest in the suburbs. In the early 2000s, a firm called Redbrick Partners tried buy-to-rent. It ultimately abandoned the effort. Unlike in an apartment building, its leadership noted, where corporate management is common, fixing faucets and other maintenance were much less efficient when dealing with geographically dispersed homes.\n\nBut during the Great Recession — just before the decline of new starts in Erb's chart — the U.S. had a glut of single-family homes in foreclosure. Many were auctioned off en masse, including by the federal government, which organized auctions for investors like Blackstone and even provided a $1 billion loan guarantee to encourage Blackstone to buy.\n\nThis allowed private equity firms (which raise money from wealthy families, pension funds and other organizations to seek out profits, often by buying private companies) and real estate investors to efficiently and cheaply buy, say, a dozen similar homes located in the same Phoenix suburb.\n\nThis solved two big problems for these institutional investors. It reduced the \"search costs\" of finding suitable homes (often starter homes with three bedrooms), and it allowed them to buy similar homes clustered in one area (which ameliorated the dispersed-faucets problem).\n\nBlackstone then introduced a financial product that supercharged the buy-to-rent sector: the rent-backed security. It was a bond, or IOU. Investors bought them, providing Blackstone with more money to buy and renovate homes. In exchange, investors were entitled to a cut of future rent payments.\n\nWall Street could now buy homes by paying with the rent they would collect in the future. Per the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the number of homes owned by Blackstone and similar firms increased from almost nothing in 2010 to around 400,000 by 2021.\n\nThis is around when Erb and his cousin started buying homes. The batch auctions were long gone. But Erb says new technology allows companies like his to have a geographically dispersed portfolio of homes. The universality of listing platforms such as Redfin and Zillow keeps search costs down. Products like Ring cameras allow potential tenants to tour properties without being shown around by an agent. And software like Zoom has made it easier for them, like other executives, to manage a remote workforce.\n\nIn 2012, many government officials had welcomed firms like Blackstone into the housing market because they worried about abandoned houses and saw rental conversions as a win. Today, though, institutional investors compete with middle-class families for starter homes. Is that why homeownership has gotten more expensive?\n\nThe trade-off\n\nAs Kamala Harris and JD Vance were calling for bans on corporate landlords, Konhee Chang was a Ph.D. student in economics. Born in Korea, Chang had always rented while living in the U.S. but never the \"quintessential house that I think of when I think about an American house,\" with a front yard and a backyard. He wanted to know why there were so few rentals in the suburbs and who would live there if renting was an option.\n\nChang realized these investors' buy-to-rent strategy provided an ideal case study of what happens when more rentals are available. If someone had built new homes to rent out, that would increase the supply of homes, changing the neighborhood. But since they converted homes into rentals, only one variable had changed, like in an experiment.\n\nSo Chang assembled and analyzed data on neighborhoods before and after corporate landlords showed up, including demographic data on the residents. His biggest finding? Institutional investors were reducing segregation. When private equity rented out homes, the new tenants tended to be lower income than the prior owners and more likely to be young and nonwhite.\n\n\"I think I was most surprised by the fact that the effect was so sharp and immediate,\" says Chang, who has since earned his Ph.D. from UC Berkeley. He took it as a sign that these families really wanted to live in these areas but were prevented by the lack of rentals and their inability to get a mortgage.\n\nThis is particularly notable because one of the most important economics findings of the past decade is the impact on children's development and career prospects of their hometown and neighborhood. (You can listen to a Planet Money episode on moving to opportunity here.) Suburban neighborhoods are not inherently better than rural or urban areas. But another study, for example, showed that single-family rentals in North Carolina served \"as a pathway for access to high-performing public schools\" for economically disadvantaged children.\n\nThese results did not turn Chang into a cheerleader for private equity. He's too careful a scholar, and his results hold for rentals in general, regardless of whether the landlord is Invitation Homes or a couple down the street. Plus, he did not investigate other criticisms of corporate ownership.\n\n(For example, a Bloomberg investigation in 2013 found that Magnetar Capital LLC became the largest landlord in Huber Heights, Ohio, and then pushed for lower assessments of its properties' value. If it had succeeded, it would have been the largest property tax cut in county history, reducing the school district's budget by $800,000 a year.)\n\nMost of all, Chang found that the buy-to-rent strategy was hurting the middle class. Creating rentals aided lower-income families and nudged rents down. But reducing the supply of homes available for sale also pushed home prices up, hurting families on the cusp of homeownership.\n\nErb says he feels good about the rental service they provide. (In 2024, he and his cousin teamed up with a veteran real estate investor to co-found a larger investment firm, Strand Capital.) But he agrees this trade-off exists.\n\n\"There's always gonna be a cost and a benefit,\" he says. But the bigger problem for housing affordability, he adds, is that \"we just haven't built enough [homes] to keep up with the population growth and household formation.\"\n\nThe boogeyman\n\n\"People get really riled up about this idea of private equity coming in and buying the block,\" says Daryl Fairweather. \"I think they are kind of the boogeyman though.\"\n\nThat's because institutional investors own a very small slice of single-family homes in the United States. As the chief economist at the real estate platform Redfin, Fairweather says investors purchase about 17% of homes. But most of those purchases are by mom-and-pop investors, not big firms like Blackstone. Institutional investors just don't own enough homes to be the main culprit for high home prices.\n\nThe U.S. homeownership rate is around 65%.As of December 2022, the five largest investors owned about 300,000 homes — just under 2% of single-family rental homes nationally.Institutional investors own roughly 2% to 25% of single-family rentals in major markets.\n\nIn fact, Fairweather sees some societal benefits of institutional investors. Unlike with mom-and-pop landlords, it's easier to regulate large corporate landlords and check whether they are, say, following the Fair Housing Act. Plus, in places like Silicon Valley, where politicians are trying to address housing crises by encouraging the development of duplexes and triplexes, profit-driven institutional investors are a potential boon, since they're more likely to turn suburban homes into duplexes.\n\nAnd in areas with more open land, like the suburbs near Denver, institutional investors are building new housing specifically to rent out. Think cookie-cutter homes, perhaps with a dog park or pool.\n\n\"I think that we should embrace investors who want to make those kinds of investments,\" Fairweather says.\n\nStill, she thinks middle-class families are right to worry about private equity displacing them from the housing market. She worries about fewer families achieving homeownership and gaining control over this intimate part of their lives, which has also been the dominant path to building wealth in America.\n\nBut a ban? As an economist, she hates bans. If politicians succeed in banning corporate landlords, perhaps by making it illegal to own more than 300 homes, she suspects we'd see lots of 300-home companies replacing Blackstone — without doing anything to increase homeownership among the middle class.\n\nInstead, she advocates for policies that will incentivize and allow developers to build more housing. The trade-off caused by single-family rentals — that they benefit some low-income renters but hurt some aspiring homebuyers — is \"because we are restricting the number of homes that can be built in neighborhoods.\"\n\nMany desirable neighborhoods are zoned so that it's impossible to build the duplexes or apartment buildings that would make them accessible to low-income families. Many prosperous towns block the building of new single-family homes, often at the behest of current homeowners who don't want to deal with construction or who want to restrict supply and boost their home's value. The best way to stick it to Blackstone and private equity, to prevent Wall Street firms from profiting off the housing crisis, is to make it easier to build more homes.\n\nAs for Daniel Erb, even though he has spent his career responding to the dearth of suburban homes, betting on our collective underinvestment in American dream properties, he might appreciate that too. He says he doesn't own a home, in part because he often travels to the towns where his company buys homes. And he says he's not buying for himself at today's prices.\n\nAlex Mayyasi is the author of The Planet Money Book, due to be published in April 2026.

The FCC has been investigating Comcast’s diversity policies. In April, Carr said the NBC News and MSNBC parent was \"misleading the American public\" with its coverage of a high-profile deportation, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Carr has signaled he would have no issue doing the same today. While previous FCC chairs tried to appear independent of the president’s agenda, Carr said he is leaning in. \"We are fully aligned with the agenda that President Trump is running,\" he told the paper. Critics argue Carr is politicizing the FCC’s work. \"This appears to be part of a political campaign against what the chairman perceives to be enemies of the president,\" said Robert Corn-Revere, chief counsel of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), arguing to the Wall Street Journal that it violates the agency’s responsibility to protect free speech.

Before the deal, Skydance also pledged it would appoint an ombudsman to \"evaluate complaints of bias\" at Paramount, and would not enact new diversity policies.

It was a visual guide that the agency had kept for years to explain Social Security’s many technological systems and processes. The paper was covered in flow charts, arrows and text so minuscule you almost needed a magnifying glass to read it. Dudek called it Social Security’s “Dead Sea Scroll.”\n\nDudek and a fellow Social Security Administration bureaucrat taped the scroll across a wall of a windowless executive office. This was where a team from the new Department of Government Efficiency was going to set up shop.\n\nDOGE was already terrifying the federal bureaucracy with the prospect of mass job loss and intrusions into previously sacrosanct databases. Still, Dudek and a handful of his tech-oriented colleagues were hopeful: If any agency needed a dose of efficiency, it was theirs. “There was kind of an excitement, actually,” a longtime top agency official said. “I’d spent 29 years trying to use technology and data in ways that the agency would never get around to.”\n\nThe Social Security Administration is 90 years old. Even today, thousands of its physical records are stored in former limestone mines in Missouri and Pennsylvania. Its core software dates back to the early 1980s, and only a few programmers remain who understand the intricacies of its more than 60 million lines of code. The agency has been talking about switching from paper Social Security cards to electronic ones for two decades, without making it happen.\n\nDOGE, billed as a squad of crack technologists, seemed perfectly designed to overcome such obstacles. And its young members were initially inquisitive about how Social Security worked and what most needed fixing. Several times over those first few days, Akash Bobba, a 21-year-old coder who’d been the first of them to arrive, held his face close to Dudek’s scroll, tracing connections between the agency’s venerable IT systems with his index finger. Bobba asked: “Who would know about this part of the architecture?”\n\nBefore long, though, he and the other DOGErs buried their heads in their laptops and plugged in their headphones. Their senior leaders had already written out goals on a whiteboard. At the top: Find fraud. Quickly.\n\nDudek’s scroll was forgotten. The heavy paper started to unpeel from the wall, and it eventually sagged to the floor.\n\nIt only got worse from there, said Dudek, who would — improbably — be named acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration, a position he held through May. In 15 hours of interviews with ProPublica, Dudek described the chaos of working with DOGE and how he tried first to collaborate, and then to protect the agency, resulting in turns that were at various times alarming, confounding and tragicomic.\n\nDOGE, he said, began acting like “a bunch of people who didn’t know what they were doing, with ideas of how government should run — thinking it should work like a McDonald’s or a bank — screaming all the time.”\n\nThe shock troops of DOGE, at the Social Security Administration and myriad other federal agencies, were the advance guard in perhaps the most dramatic transformation of the U.S. government since the New Deal. And despite the highly public departure of DOGE’s leader, Elon Musk, that campaign continues today. Key DOGE team members have transitioned to permanent jobs at the SSA, including as the agency’s top technology officials. The 19-year-old whose self-anointed moniker — “Big Balls” — has made him one of the most memorable DOGErs joined the agency this summer.\n\nThe DOGE philosophy has been embraced by the SSA’s commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who was confirmed by the Senate in May. “Your bias has to be — because mine is — that DOGE is helping make things better,” Bisignano told senior officials weeks after replacing Dudek, according to a recording obtained by ProPublica. “It may not feel that way, but don’t believe everything you read.”\n\nIn a statement, a Social Security Administration spokesperson said that Bisignano has made “notable” initial progress and that “the initiatives underway will continue to strengthen service delivery and enhance the integrity and efficiency of our systems.” The statement asserted that “under President Trump’s leadership and his commitment to protect and preserve Social Security, Commissioner Bisignano is strengthening Social Security and the programs it provides for Americans now and in the future.”\n\nFor all the controversy DOGE has generated, its time at the Social Security Administration has not amounted to looming armageddon, as some Democrats warn. What it’s been, as much as anything, is a missed opportunity, according to interviews with more than 35 current or recently departed Social Security officials and staff, who spoke on the condition of anonymity mostly out of fear of retaliation by the Trump administration, and a review of hundreds of pages of internal documents, emails and court records.\n\nThe DOGE team, and Bisignano, have prioritized scoring quick wins that allow them to post triumphant tweets and press releases — especially, in the early months, about an essentially nonexistent form of fraud — while squandering the chance for systemic change at an agency that genuinely needs it.\n\nThey could have worked to modernize Social Security’s legacy software, the current and former staffers say. They could have tried to streamline the stupefying volume of documentation that many Social Security beneficiaries have to provide. They could have built search tools to help staff navigate the agency’s 60,000 pages of policies. (New hires often need at least three years to master the nuances of even one type of case.) They could have done something about wait times for disability claims and appeals, which often take over a year.\n\nThey did none of these things.\n\nUltimately, no one had a more complete view of the missed opportunity than Lee Dudek. A 48-year-old with a shaved pate and a broad build that suggests an aging former linebacker, Dudek is a figure seemingly native to the universe of President Donald Trump — an unlikely holder of a key post, elevated after little or no vetting, who briefly attains notoriety in Washington circles before vanishing into obscurity — not unlike Anthony Scaramucci in the first Trump administration.\n\nDudek, a midlevel bureaucrat with blunt confidence and a preference for his own ideas, had failed in his one past attempt to manage a small team within the SSA, leading him and his supervisors to conclude he shouldn’t oversee others. Despite that, Trump made him the boss of 57,500 people as acting commissioner of the agency this spring.\n\nDudek got the job, wittingly or not, through an end-run around his bosses. After Trump won the 2024 election and rumors of a cost-cutting-and-efficiency SWAT team began to swirl, Dudek asked people he knew at big tech companies for introductions to potential DOGE members. In December, a contact set him up with Musk’s right-hand man, Steve Davis, which led to conversations with other DOGE figures about how they could “hack” Social Security’s bureaucracy to “get to yes,” Dudek said.\n\nBy February, Dudek had become the conduit between DOGE and the SSA, alerting top agency officials that DOGE wanted to work at headquarters. And unlike Michelle King, the acting agency chief at the time, Dudek was willing to speed up the new-hire training process to give DOGE access to virtually all of the SSA’s databases. This precipitated a sequence of events that began with him being placed on administrative leave, where he wrote a LinkedIn post that propelled him into the public eye for the first time: “I confess,” he posted. “I helped DOGE understand SSA. … I confess. I … circumvented the chain of command to connect DOGE with the people who get stuff done.” The same weekend, King resigned and Dudek, who was at home in his underwear watching MSNBC, got an email stating that the president of the United States had appointed him commissioner.\n\nBetween February and May, when Dudek’s tenure ended, his erratic rhetoric and decisions routinely madefront-page news. He was often portrayed as a DOGE patsy, perhaps even a fool. But in his interviews with ProPublica this summer, he revealed himself to be a much more complex figure, a disappointed believer in DOGE’s potential, who maintains he did what he could to protect Social Security’s mission under duress.\n\nDudek is the first agency head to speak in detail on the record about what it is like to be thrust into such an important position under Trump. He told ProPublica that he decided to speak because he wishes that “those who govern” would have more frank and honest conversations with the public.\n\nTo the 73 million Americans whose financial lives depend on the viability of Social Security, those first months were a seesaw of apprehension and rumor. Inside the agency, Dudek, ill-prepared for leadership or for DOGE’s murky agenda, was stumbling through the chaos in part by creating some of his own.\n\nDudek knows what it’s like to depend on Social Security. When he was a kid in Saginaw, Michigan, his mother turned to Social Security disability benefits to support him and his siblings after she got injured at a Ford-affiliated parts factory; she also had a mental-health breakdown. (Dudek’s now-deceased father, who worked for General Motors, was alternately abusive and absent, according to the family.)\n\nAt school, Dudek was isolated and bullied for being poor, his sister told ProPublica, and he’s had an underdog’s quick temper ever since. But he was always an advanced student, and he developed an early interest in computer science and politics. As a teenager, he often watched C-Span. He was fascinated, he said, by “how government worked and how it could change people’s lives.”\n\nDudek arrived in Washington in 1995 to attend Catholic University of America. He was the type of earnest young man who was enthralled by President Bill Clinton’s campaign at the time to “reinvent government” by injecting it with private sector-style efficiency, much as Trump and DOGE later said they would.\n\nIn college, he also displayed the tendency to buck authority that would mark his professional career. He had a night job running the university’s computer labs; if there were problems, he was supposed to call his boss. He wasn’t supposed to install new software on all the computers, but that’s what he did. It worked, although he got a talking-to about knowing his role.\n\nAfter graduating, Dudek spent nearly a decade working for tech companies that contracted with the federal government on modernization projects, before migrating to several jobs within federal agencies themselves.\n\nIn 2009, he arrived at the Social Security Administration as an IT security official. The agency was just like the Saginaw he’d run from, Dudek said: an insular, hidebound place where everyone knew everyone and they all thought innovation would cost them their jobs.\n\nBut the SSA wasn’t the only institution at fault. Congress had enacted byzantine eligibility requirements for disability and Supplemental Security Income benefits, forcing the agency to expend huge amounts of time and money running those programs. At the same time, lawmakers had capped the agency’s administrative funding just as tens of millions of Baby Boomers were aging into retirement, exploding Social Security’s rolls. (The SSA is now at its lowest staffing level in a half-century, even as it has taken on 40 million more beneficiaries.)\n\nBecause of the SSA’s stultifying culture, Dudek said, he leaned into his insubordinate streak. He had the sense that he could do it better, and when he felt like his proposals weren’t receiving money or attention, he went around his superiors. In one instance, he approached potential partners at credit card companies, hoping they would like his ideas for combating fraud and would relay those ideas to the Social Security commissioner at the time. “Certainly from an internal perspective within SSA, certainly from a congressional perspective, I was violating rules,” Dudek said.\n\nIn part because of moves like this, Dudek got reassigned within the agency several times. Over the years, he was given multiple roles as a “senior adviser,” a title he said is for federal employees who are either incompetent but too established to fire or highly competent in a technical way but lacking in management or people skills.\n\nDudek was stubborn. He could come off as a know-it-all, and he tended to ramble when speaking. But he is also thoughtful and well read. In our interviews, he brought up everything from the origins of the concept of Social Security among sociologists and psychologists in the Depression era to the bureaucrats who were left behind in faraway places after the decline of the British Empire. He repeatedly cited James Q. Wilson’s seminal 1989 book, “Bureaucracy,” which spills considerable ink on the inefficiencies of the Social Security Administration — and on a businessman named Donald J. Trump who supposedly knew how to cut through red tape to get building projects done. (“No such law constrained Trump,” Wilson wrote.)\n\nDudek had been a lifelong Democrat and voted for Kamala Harris. But, like some other liberals, he was becoming exasperated with the “administrative state” and special-interest groups, including corporations, unions and social-justice organizations, that “capture” government and stifle reform. If it took Trump to cut through that, Dudek was open-minded. “The world has changed,” he scribbled in a note to himself. “We must change with it.”\n\nImmediately after Dudek became commissioner in February, he got a call from Scott Coulter, a hedge fund manager with a $12 million Manhattan apartment who’d been picked to lead DOGE’s team at Social Security. “We’re coming,” Coulter said. “Be prepared.”\n\nDOGE arrived ready to embark on a specific mission: Its operatives at the Treasury Department had seen data suggesting that the Social Security Administration wasn’t keeping its death records up to date. They thought they saw signs of fraudulent payments. Musk was very, very interested.\n\nDudek wasn’t initially concerned about this focus, which he and his colleagues viewed as misguided. To him, the young coders were nerdy outsiders just like he’d once been, albeit ones from privileged Ivy League and Silicon Valley backgrounds. They “reminded me of myself when I first got into computers,” he said. He thought he could mold them.\n\nIn particular, Dudek liked Bobba, who had a gentle air and a thick pile of dark hair that covered his forehead. Dudek had spent hours with Bobba, trying to get him to focus on concrete problems like how beneficiaries’ records were stored, often as cumbersome PDF and image files. Instead, Bobba, who did not respond to a request for comment, prioritized Musk’s quest to prove that dead people were receiving Social Security benefits.\n\nBobba had completed high school in New Jersey just three and a half years earlier. As a class speaker at his graduation, he’d encouraged his classmates not to ignore “nuance” and “complexity.” He’d lamented the “increasing willingness to simplify even the most complex narratives into sensational tidbits” like “280-character tweets,” which “perpetuates misinformation.”\n\nYet Dudek had barely settled in as commissioner when Bobba unintentionally sparked a national misinformation firestorm: A table he created appeared as a screenshot in a grossly misleading Musk tweet about “vampires” over the age of 100 allegedly collecting Social Security checks. Bobba had sorted people with a Social Security number by age and found more than 12 million over 120 years old still listed in the agency’s data.\n\nBobba said he knew these people weren’t actually receiving benefits and tried to tell Musk so, to no avail, according to SSA officials. Dudek watched in horror as Trump then shared the same statistics with both houses of Congress and a national television audience, claiming the numbers proved “shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors.” (The White House declined to comment on this episode. Bisignano, the new SSA commissioner, has repeatedlysaid that “the work that DOGE did was 100% accurate.”)\n\nInside the SSA, the DOGE team tried to find proof of the fraud that Musk and Trump had proclaimed, but it didn’t seem to know how to go about it, jumping from tactic to tactic. “It was a maelstrom of topic A to topic G to topic C to topic Q,” said a senior SSA official who was in the room. “Were we still helping anything by explaining stuff?” the official said. “It really wasn’t clear by that point.”\n\nDudek began to realize that the problem wasn’t primarily the people he called the “DOGE kids.” It was the senior leaders who were issuing orders without heeding what the young DOGErs were learning.\n\nDudek was perhaps the most favorably disposed to the outsiders. Plenty of agency officials were already put off by the DOGErs, who often issued peremptory orders to meet with them and answer questions.\n\nMichelle Kowalski, an analyst who has since departed the agency, was instructed to take one of the DOGE people, Cole Killian, through earnings data and historical records to analyze the cases of extremely old people whose deaths had not been recorded in Social Security data. She found herself having to explain to him, again and again, that many of these people were born before states reported births and deaths to the federal government and decades before the advent of electronic record keeping. In the early days of the agency, some people didn’t even know their birthdays.\n\nKowalski had assumed that Killian was middle-aged, since he was issuing instructions to her team. But he usually kept his camera turned off during video meetings. When he finally turned it on for one call, the face she saw seemed like that of a teenager.\n\nKillian was actually 24, just six years removed from performing “Hotel California” at his high school talent show at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School outside of Boston. (Killian, whose DOGE responsibilities also involved work at the Environmental Protection Agency, did not respond to a request for comment from ProPublica.)\n\nKowalski was exasperated by having to answer to such inexperience, even as so many of her colleagues were being pushed out the door by the Trump administration. She was not alone.\n\n“Many of us had actually believed in the marketed idea of genius technologists coming in to make things work better,” one senior SSA official said. But DOGE ended up being more interested, the official said, in “trying to prove that the Social Security Administration was entirely incompetent” than in suggesting improvements.\n\nEmployees at headquarters took their time walking past the glass-walled conference room where DOGE staffers had set up, glaring in at them as they worked among stacks of laptops that they used for assignments at different agencies. On a blog popular among SSA staffers, the mood in the comments section turned dark, with some anonymous posters identifying where in the building the “incel DOGE boys” were located and saying that “they are just warming up … just think what will come next.”\n\nDudek sensed the growing tension. He felt it, too. He’d been getting anonymous death threats mailed to his house. He decided to move the DOGE operatives to a more secluded area of the campus and assigned an armed security detail to protect them.\n\nDuring his first month as commissioner, Dudek ran his executive meetings in bombastic fashion, as if he were Trump on “The Apprentice.” And he sent out insulting full-staff emails pressuring career employees to retire. (Some 5,500 have left, with 1,500 more expected to follow.)\n\nDudek says this behavior stemmed partly from being in over his head, amazed by who he was suddenly answering to. “When the president of the United States asks you to do stuff,” he said, “you get caught up.”\n\nBut he also claims he was just performing a role. “Early on, I put on a persona of a yeller,” Dudek said. (Multiple longtime colleagues and friends noticed the change, they told ProPublica. As one put it, “There’s Lee, and then there’s Leland-performingly-Dudek.”)\n\nThis, he hoped, would convince the White House and DOGE of his commitment, which could in turn give him credibility as he kept trying to push them toward the real issues at Social Security.\n\nBut the Trump administration kept having other plans. Its demands usually came through Coulter, the DOGE lead with the Harvard and hedge fund background, who early on dropped by Dudek’s office unannounced multiple times a week, Dudek said.\n\n“I really think it would be helpful if you were to do this tomorrow,” Coulter would say to Dudek about eliminating an entire division of the SSA or cutting more staff, according to Dudek. To him, these suggestions felt like orders. If he responded, “I don’t know, let me think about it,” Coulter would call a few hours later on the encrypted-messaging app Signal to ask, “You really aren’t catching on, are you?” and “Do you know how many times I’ve defended you?”\n\n“I was supposed to get the message — and it would be ‘my own decision,’ so I’d be stuck with it,” Dudek said. “He can say he never told me to do anything.” (Coulter, who has been working for DOGE at NASA in recent months, did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nOne of Coulter’s suggestions involved the SSA’s Office of Transformation, which had been doing the seemingly DOGE-like work of developing an online application to replace many of the agency’s paper-based forms and in-person interviews. The office had been working with elderly, low-income and disabled people to see what most confused them about SSA processes and what would most help them if these were redesigned.\n\nBut instead of facilitating this effort at greater efficiency, Coulter told Dudek to close the office, according to Dudek, claiming it was wasteful. Agency staff joked that DOGE shut it down because its name included a word that began with “trans.”\n\nDudek and his colleagues sometimes attempted to co-opt DOGE’s obsessions in the hope that they could address a genuine problem at the agency. This strategy was not successful.\n\nSuch was the case with the issue of phone fraud. Knowing that the DOGErs would perk up at the mention of anything fraud-related, Dudek and other officials made a point of explaining that they’d been working on an initiative to block bots that had been calling the agency. The bots would impersonate beneficiaries, using dates of birth and other information that can be found on the internet, to try to change the beneficiaries’ bank-routing information and steal their benefits.\n\nIn 2024, Dudek had been on a team that spearheaded an effort to combat this type of fraud. The plans included running all phone-based requests for bank account changes against a Treasury Department database of suspicious accounts and analyzing such calls to verify whether they were being made from the vicinity of the address on file of the person purportedly calling.\n\nDOGE ignored the proposed solutions. Instead, the White House instructed Dudek to end all claims and direct-deposit transactions by phone. Beneficiaries would have to verify their own identities by using an often-confusing web portal or by traveling to a field office to do it in person. For millions of elderly or disabled people, these were daunting or impossible options.\n\nWhen this policy was rolled out at the end of March, beneficiaries panicked. Many flocked to field offices to preemptively provide proof of their identities even when they didn’t need to.\n\nBack at headquarters, in a weekly staff meeting, Dudek asked who could jump on the increasingly urgent task of making it easier to schedule field office appointments via the SSA website. “Well, Lee, you just fired that team,” one official answered, referring to the Office of Transformation. (Dudek said he asked this question on purpose to make sure DOGE heard the answer.)\n\nOver the course of six weeks under Dudek, the phone policy zigged and zagged a half dozen times — for example, the SSA adopted, then abandoned, a three-day waiting period to conduct an algorithmic fraud check on all calls — before finally ending up nearly where it began. Transactions could be carried out by phone again.\n\nThroughout this saga, Dudek was still getting calls from White House officials — most often from Katie Miller, DOGE’s spokesperson and the wife of Stephen Miller, one of Trump’s closest advisers. (Katie Miller went on to work for Musk before announcing plans to launch her own podcast. She did not respond to a request for comment.) Miller often called well into the evening, Dudek said, to chastise him about anything the press had reported that day that had caught the administration off guard.\n\nAs Dudek restored the phone policy to its pre-Trump version, Miller got angrier. “You changed the president’s policy,” she said, according to Dudek.\n\n“I’m like, ‘No, I’m still with the president’s policy,’” Dudek told Miller. But, if Social Security officials could implement the anti-fraud measures that he and his team had previously been planning, he said, they could “achieve the same end.” In that case, Dudek said, “we will do so and ease the friction point on the public.”\n\n“How dare you,” Miller said.\n\nIncreasingly dismayed, Dudek hatched a plan that seemed to embody his mix of good intentions, hubris and melodrama. He decided he would continue to play along with DOGE on the surface, in part so that Coulter and the other bigwigs would think he was still handling their business and thus spend less time at the agency. The younger DOGE team members, he said, were “easier to work with when their masters weren’t around.”\n\nBut behind the scenes, he began to undermine DOGE however he could. Sometimes he did this by making intemperate statements that he knew would find their way into the press and draw attention to what DOGE was asking him to do. “Have you ever worked with someone who’s manic-depressive?” he said of the Trump administration’s leadership in one meeting.\n\nOther times Dudek himself was the leaker. As commissioner, he was often an anonymous source for articles in The Washington Post and The New York Times. “If it was stupid stuff from the DOGE team, a lot of times I would go out to the press and immediately tattletale on myself so that it would blow up the next day,” Dudek said, adding that he did this in part to help Social Security advocates understand and bring attention to the growing crisis at the agency.\n\nRebecca Vallas, CEO of the nonprofit National Academy of Social Insurance, said she was in a one-on-one meeting with Dudek in March when he started getting calls from DOGE officials and the media. The calls were about his recent public comments claiming he might have to shut down the entire Social Security Administration if a federal judge continued to deny DOGE access to sensitive Social Security data. “He just let me sit there with the volume up high,” Vallas said.\n\nOn one of the calls, she said, someone told Dudek, “Elon loved that, but now it’s time to walk it back.” Afterward, Dudek told her, “I don’t know how we get out of this without hurting huge numbers of people. … I’m just trying to give advocates some ammunition.”\n\nDudek’s strategy was easier to pull off without DOGE catching on if it came off as the blundering of an amateur, he told ProPublica. In the most striking example, DOGE instructed Dudek to cancel two contracts that the SSA had with the state of Maine, according to Dudek and other SSA officials. The contracts, which all 50 states have long had versions of, allowed Maine to automatically report births and deaths to Social Security. Canceling them would impede government efficiency: Births and deaths in the state would take weeks or months longer to enter the federal system. That would likely cause benefits to continue to be sent to thousands of Mainers after they’ve died, exactly the kind of thing that Trump and Musk had been railing against.\n\nIt seemed clear to Dudek that he was being told to do this only because Trump was publicly feuding with Maine’s governor about transgender athletes. (The White House declined to comment on this episode.) So he decided to “write the hell out of” an email directing that the contracts be canceled. He did so in a way he thought would still earn him points with Trump and DOGE but that would, simultaneously, be so inflammatory that it would create a major storyline for reporters, advocates and Congress.\n\n“Please cancel the contracts,” Dudek’s email read. “While our improper payments will go up, and fraudsters may compromise identities, no money will go from the public trust to a petulant child.” That last phrase referred to Maine’s governor, Janet Mills, the one Trump had been fighting with. (“Do I care about Janet Mills? No,” Dudek told ProPublica.)\n\nAs Dudek had hoped, the press attention he generated compelled him to do what he already wanted to do: reinstate the contracts. In a written apology, he explained that he was only belatedly realizing the potential harm of what he (alone) had done. “I screwed up,” he told reporters. “I’m new at this job.”\n\nOnce again, Miller called Dudek and excoriated him. “What the hell is going on?” she said.\n\n“This place leaks like a sieve,” he answered. “What can I tell you?”\n\nLooking back on his tenure, Dudek maintains that his three months working alongside DOGE were not as harmful as they could have been, especially compared with what happened this spring at other federal agencies, some of which were essentially vaporized. Social Security checks, he points out, are still going out the door.\n\nStill, the SSA is reduced in his wake, with thousands fewer staff members to process claims and improve systems. These departed employees were disproportionately experienced and knowledgeable; they were the ones able to get other jobs or to retire with a pension. They took a lot of know-how with them.\n\nAnd the emotional harm that DOGE caused to older people and to people with disabilities — worsened by Dudek’s confusing actions — lingers. Many of these people have had money taken out of their paychecks their entire careers to pay for something more than just retirement benefits: security. It’s a feeling that may now be lost to them forever.\n\nIndeed, DOGE and Dudek caused so much consternation about the stability of the system that hundreds of thousands of people have filed early for retirement in recent months, even though doing so is not financially wise in the long term. The SSA must now pay out more in benefits than expected, contrary to DOGE’s cost-saving mission.\n\nDudek’s sister back in Saginaw, Ana Dudek, relies on Social Security disability benefits. “I would talk to my brother when he was commissioner and be like, dude, the decisions you’re making are causing people to feel terror,” she said. “Terror is an apt descriptor.”\n\nDudek acknowledges much of this. “I’m not a cold, callous son of a bitch, I really do get it,” he said. “I’ll forever be associated with the pain of DOGE. … But so much went on in such a short amount of time. I tried to make the best decisions I could given the circumstances.”\n\nSince being dismissed from the agency in June, Dudek has been struggling to find another job. “My name is mud,” he said. “It is as if I no longer exist.”\n\nAs a former SSA colleague put it, Dudek’s story is “the story of a disposable pawn, and there’s lots of those under Trump. They just used him, and then they disposed of him.”\n\nThe White House, presented with extensive questions for this article, sent a one-paragraph statement disparaging ProPublica and Dudek. ProPublica’s story, White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said, “is largely based around the comments of a disgruntled former employee who openly admitted to leaking to the media, manipulating his colleagues, and repeatedly telling lies from his official position. On his last day as Acting Commissioner, Leland Dudek showered praise upon President Trump in an op-ed and touted the ‘real results’ of the Social Security Administration, but now that he’s bitter about being out of the top job — he’s singing a different tune.”\n\nDudek said the administration asked him to write the op-ed and then vetted it. Referring to the litany of extravagant praise that cabinet secretaries lavished on Trump recently, he said, “you saw the cabinet meeting.”\n\nBisignano, the Social Security commissioner, comes to the role with a very different professional background than Dudek (though, like Dudek, he has working-class roots, in his case in Brooklyn). Until this job, Bisignano, 66, spent his career in the private sector. He was a top executive in operations and technology at massive banks like Citigroup and JPMorganChase and went on to become CEO of the payment processor Fiserv.\n\nYet, like DOGE, he appears to have embraced the appearance of efficiency rather than efficiency itself. He has repeatedly told staff that Social Security should be run more like Amazon, with AI handling more customer interactions. But disability claims are more complicated than ordering toothpaste, according to SSA officials and experts, and Social Security’s customer base is older and more likely to have an intellectual disability than the average Amazon Prime member.\n\nBisignano has also fixated on how much time it takes to reach an agent on the SSA’s 800 number. In a July press release, he claimed that the average was down to six minutes, an 80% reduction from 2024. He achieved this in part by reassigning 1,000 field office employees to phone duty. That means initial calls are getting answered faster, but there are significantly fewer staff members available to handle complex, in-person cases. And “reaching an agent” turns out to mean speaking to a human being — or an AI bot. Internal SSA statistics obtained by ProPublica reveal that Bisignano’s estimate treats cases in which beneficiaries interact with a chatbot and opt for a callback as “zero-minute” waits, skewing the average. If you actually stay on the line, USA Today has found, it often takes over an hour to reach a live representative.\n\nIn its statement, the SSA reiterated that call wait times have dramatically improved and that “using technology on our national 800 number has enabled 90 percent of calls handled to be served via automated self-service options or convenient callbacks.”\n\nEven the latest phone fraud policy feels like a rerun from DOGE’s earlier season. In late July, Bisignano’s team quietly posted a document to the Office of Management and Budget website stating that 3.4 million more people would have to go into field offices to verify their identities instead of being able to do so by phone, starting Aug. 18. Days later, the SSA announced that this was actually optional.\n\nThe DOGE era may officially be over at the agency, but the approach, it seems, is the same. As one SSA official put it, Bisignano is “doing all the same fundamentally inefficient things, more efficiently.”","summary":"Insiders describe the chaos of their time working with the spending-slashing agency","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/09/09/the-untold-saga-of-what-happened-when-doge-stormed-social-security_partner/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/03/elon-musk-2206725167-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-09 10:00:31","author":"Eli Hager","authors":["Eli Hager"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.254},{"id":358831402,"title":"Martina Navratilova issues scathing response to Donald Trump-supporting journalist over his 'gay marriage destroyed America' take","text":"Martina Navratilova lambasted a journalist for showing stern disapproval of homosexuals, as he highlighted that gay marriages have \"destroyed\" the US.

McCaskill\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic Texas state lawmaker launched a U.S. Senate campaign on Tuesday, challenging a former member of Congress for his party's nomination in a state no Democrat has won since 1994.\n\nState Representative James Talarico, who represents Austin in the statehouse, will face former U.S. Representative Colin Allred, who raised more than $90 million as the party's nominee last cycle against Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz.\n\n“This is an underdog fight,” Talarico said in a statement. “We’re going up against the political establishment, and we’re going up against a lot of money. Big Money is powerful, but it's nothing compared to people power.”\n\nRepublicans hold a 53-seat majority in the U.S. Senate and are favored to hold the majority as they have few incumbents up for re-election in states seen as competitive by nonpartisan analysts. Democrats, meanwhile, must defend competitive seats in Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota and New Hampshire.\n\nDemocrats would need to net four seats in 2026 to win a Senate majority, which would require them to win fairly competitive states such as Maine and North Carolina in addition to heavily Republican ones such as Ohio and Texas.\n\nTalarico, 36, has repeatedly gone viral on TikTok, where he has more than 1 million followers, and grew his national profile as he and other Texas Democrats fled the state last month to deny a quorum in the Republican-controlled Texas House, delaying passage of the party's mid-decade gerrymander to create five new Republican congressional seats.\n\nAllred, a former civil rights lawyer and NFL player, was elected to Congress in 2018 after flipping a battleground district. He lost to Cruz last year by more than 8 percentage points but outperformed the top of the ticket, as President Donald Trump defeated then-Vice President Kamala Harris by nearly 14 percentage points. Allred launched his second Senate campaign in July, hoping to unseat incumbent Republican Senator John Cornyn.\n\nCornyn, a former Texas Supreme Court justice and state attorney general, has served in the Senate since 2002. This cycle, however, he faces a tough primary challenger in Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a conservative firebrand who was impeached by the Texas House in 2023 but later acquitted by the Texas Senate.\n\nDemocrats have been shut out of statewide office in Texas for decades. Former Representative Beto O'Rourke came within 3 percentage points of ousting Cruz in 2018, but subsequent elections have shown O'Rourke's margin to be more of an outlier than a trend.\n\n(Reporting by Nolan D.

And after RFK Jr. got absolutely hammered at that hearing the other day–including by a member of the leadership, Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso–he realized that he had to cut his losses. What was he going to do, say ignore those Republican senators, like Bill Cassidy, who’s a doctor, like Barrasso, when he says that vaccines work and he’s deeply concerned that Kennedy misled the Hill during his confirmation hearings? So after months of letting him \"go wild,\" in his words, Donald has broken with Bobby. REPUBLICAN DOCTORS CLASH WITH RFK JR OVER VACCINES IN TENSE SENATE SHOWDOWN \"You have some vaccines that are so incredible. I think you have to be very careful when you say some people don’t have to be vaccinated…,\" the president said. \"Look, you have vaccines that work. They just pure and simple work. They’re not controversial at all, and I think those vaccines should be used, otherwise some people are going to catch it, and they endanger other people,\" The president has had enough. What’s more, Kennedy’s family–including his sister Kerry and former congressman Joe Kennedy III–demanded he resign, along with every Democrat on the Senate committee. There’s some chatter that Kennedy may be let go after a decent interval. Trump really likes him, and the magic of the Kennedy name, but let’s face it, he’s damaged goods right now. He also was poorly briefed, or didn’t do his homework. Remember that he cut a deal in exchange for dropping out of the presidential race, and offered the same arrangement to Kamala Harris. When asked how many Americans had died of COVID, I instantly knew it was 1.2 million. RFK said he didn’t know. Asked whether the COVID vaccine had been helpful, he mumbled that he’d have to look at the data. There’s plenty of data available. And that’s the problem. The greatest achievement of Trump’s first term, as even his detractors admit, was Operation War Speed, bringing the COVID vaccine to market at the height of the pandemic. JOE KENNEDY III BLASTS RFK JR. AFTER FIERY SENATE HEARING, FUELING KENNEDY FAMILY INFIGHTING: 'HE MUST RESIGN' But Kennedy is the same anti-vaccine crusader he’s always been. He has called COVID \"the most dangerous vaccine\" ever. He’s insisted that vaccines cause autism, completely debunked by mainstream science. CDC performed miserably during the pandemic, but Kennedy fired CDC chief Susan Monarez just one month after praising her appointment, and then called her a liar for supposedly admitting she was not trustworthy. So RFK was in effect denigrating Trump’s huge accomplishment by firing the mainstream members of a vaccine panel and replacing them with vaccine skeptics or outright anti-vaxxers. Kennedy’s view is that everyone else is conflicted because of ties to Big Pharma and that only he is pure. But his actions speak louder than his words. INTO THE ARENA: HOSTILE DEMOCRATS, SKEPTICAL REPUBLICANS TEAR INTO KENNEDY ON THE HILL Meanwhile, the president won a double victory at the Supreme Court. The justices, in what Politico says were 6-3 rulings, gave ICE the ability to carry out \"roving\" arrests and raids in California against those believed to be illegal immigrants. SCOTUS also said the president can fire FTC member Rebecca Slaughter, one of two Democratic commissioners he dismissed in March at the supposedly independent agency. Then Trump checks the conservative media. The Wall Street Journal editorial page, in a piece titled \"Operation Warped Speed,\" asks whether RFK is suffering from long COVID.

Happy Birthday–and may every day be another wonderful secret.By itself, I don’t think it’s that big a deal. Lots of friends and acquaintances were solicited to send messages for Epstein’s 50th birthday. He could have owned it. But Trump *still* insists it’s fake.By vehemently insisting it wasn’t conceivable that he sent such a message, Trump now has a mess on his hands.","summary":"President Trump distances himself from RFK Jr.&apos;s anti-vaccine positions following Senate criticism, as Supreme Court backs his immigration and agency firing powers.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/why-trump-broke-rfk-defend-importance-vaccines","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/09/rfk-jr-senate-testimony-hearing.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6378834659112","publish_date":"2025-09-09 07:00:01","author":"Howard Kurtz","authors":["Howard Kurtz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.011},{"id":358814330,"title":"Working-class Democrats tout their tough times in pitches for Congress","text":"ANNIE KARNINew York Times\n\nWhen Rebecca Cooke introduces herself to voters in western Wisconsin, she notes how rough she and her working-class family had it when she was growing up.\n\n\"In high school, we had to sell our cows because of the price of milk and competition with other dairies,\" Cooke, who is challenging Rep. Derrick Van Orden, a hard-right Republican, said at a recent town hall.\n\nBob Brooks, a retired Bethlehem firefighter who is running against Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, a Republican, in a Pennsylvania district that is one of the most competitive in the country, makes a similar pitch, describing how he was raised by a single mother who worked as a bartender.\n\n\"Pizza delivery, dishwasher, bartender, drove a beer truck, landscaper, coached baseball − and yeah, I was a firefighter,\" is how Brooks laid out his biography in his campaign launch video.\n\nEven that sounds coddled compared with the life story of Nathan Sage, a car mechanic raised in a trailer park in Mason City and is now running an outsider's campaign for Senate in Iowa.\n\nWith voters angry at a government that many believe has failed them at every turn, a slew of working-class Democratic candidates are entering competitive congressional races across the country with an appeal that appears aimed at being relatable, if not particularly uplifting: Our lives are just as difficult and infuriating as yours. The message from these working-class candidates is that they, like the people they are seeking to represent, are working too hard for too little and are still struggling.\n\n\"We work nonstop every day, over and over, and it seems like all we do is survive, right?\" Sage told voters recently in Cedar Rapids.\n\nIt is a fitting message for a moment when the high cost of living continues to top the list of issues voters say they care about, and after a devastating election cycle that caused Democrats to spend months soul-searching about how they got it wrong. But it is one that party leaders have not fully embraced as they try to take on Republicans in astronomically expensive campaigns for control of the closely divided Congress.\n\nEven though low-wage workers make up almost half the U.S. economy, the halls of Congress are still, by and large, populated by career politicians, lawyers and wealthy businesspeople. About 78% of senators currently in office hold an advanced degree, according to Congressional Quarterly. More than 30% of House members and 47% of senators hold a law degree.\n\nWorking-class lawmakers in Congress remain few and far between.\n\n\"Nothing has changed,\" said Nicholas Carnes, a professor of public policy at Duke University. \"It's been between zero and 2% forever.\"\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who for decades has been hammering away at the issue of income inequality, said he is backing some of these candidates because voters instinctively understand that the political system, dominated by political organizations that can raise and spend unlimited sums on campaign advertising, is broken.\n\n\"The class issue is becoming very clear and apparent to the entire country,\" Sanders said. \"Working-class candidates instinctively understand the reality; they are living that reality.\"\n\nBut the party's Senate campaign arm is not backing Graham Platner, an oysterman from the tiny town of Sullivan, Maine, who is running a long-shot campaign to unseat Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican. Platner raised $1 million in the first week of his campaign while signing up 2,700 volunteers. But the establishment's preferred candidate is Gov. Janet Mills, 77, a two-term governor and former prosecutor, who so far has been circumspect about her plans.\n\nOn Labor Day, Sanders and Platner appeared at a rally in Portland in front of 6,500 people.\n\n\"I grew up in rural Maine, and I did four tours in the infantry. And I am not afraid to name the enemy,\" Platner said. \"The enemy is the oligarchy.\"\n\nSage is also not the preferred candidate in Iowa, where the party campaign committee has yet to make any endorsement in the race for the seat now held by Sen. Joni Ernst, a Republican who recently announced that she would not seek re-election. But party leaders have expressed excitement about Josh Turek, a Paralympic gold medalist and former pro wheelchair basketball player who serves in the state Legislature.\n\nSage likes it that way.\n\n\"I feel like Chuck Schumer and the DSCC like to lose elections rather than win elections,\" he said in an interview, referring to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \"They're comfortable where they're at. They want to continue the status quo. It's an unwillingness to see the writing on the wall.\"\n\nSchumer declined to comment for this article.\n\nDemocratic Party leaders also are not planning to back Dan Osborn, who worked as an industrial mechanic at the Kellogg's plant in Omaha, Neb. He is running again for Senate after significantly outperforming former Vice President Kamala Harris last year in an unexpectedly competitive race against Sen. Deb Fischer, a Republican. The campaign arm works to elect Democrats, and Osborn is running as an independent.\n\nOn the House side, Democrats have been embracing some of the working-class candidates.\n\nCarnes said working-class people are less likely to be able to run for office because it is time-consuming and costly.\n\n\"Even party leaders who like workers know it is harder for them to run, and they have finite resources,\" he said. \"They know it will take more of their resources to support a worker candidate, and they're facing pressure to find the low-hanging fruit: a candidate who is going to have an easy time running.\"\n\nCarnes said people become distrustful of democracy when it seems that elected office is off-limits to working people.\n\n\"If we keep an entire class of people away from our legislative institutions, they're not going to do a very good job understanding working people's problems,\" he said.","summary":"When Rebecca Cooke introduces herself to voters in western Wisconsin, she notes how rough she and her working-class family had it when she was growing up.","url":"https://buffalonews.com/article_c9c880cd-9a06-5ecc-a4e1-fa7a1e873b00.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/buffalonews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/21/d21c7566-3ec3-5285-b5fe-2c5b64e57245/68bfcf55d3420.image.jpg?crop=885%2C465%2C0%2C131","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-09 06:55:27","author":"ANNIE KARNINew York Times","authors":["ANNIE KARNINew York Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":358733318,"title":"Biden’s presidential library to be built in Delaware","text":"Former U.S. President Joe Biden's presidential library will be built in his home state of Delaware, his office said on Saturday.\n\nBiden, who served as president for four years until January 2025, represented Delaware for 36 years in the U.S. Senate before becoming vice president for President Barack Obama.\n\nHe ran for president in 2020, beating President Donald Trump, and took office in 2021.

That’s why they were silent about it for years. The only thing they care about is concocting another fake scandal like Russiagate to smear President Trump with lies. No one is falling for this BS.”\n\nThe establishment media also has been eager to inflate the significance of the well-documented but merely social relationship between Epstein and Trump.\n\nMonday, the House Oversight Committee released copies of a birthday card allegedly sent by Trump to Epstein in 2003. The Wall Street Journal reported on the alleged card in July but withheld publication, heightening speculation while the controversy festered.\n\nThe White House says the Wall Street Journal’s own reporting has proven the illegitimacy of the card.\n\n“The latest piece published by the Wall Street Journal PROVES this entire ‘Birthday Card’ story is false,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote. “As I have said all along, it’s very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it.”\n\n“President Trump’s legal team will continue to aggressively pursue litigation,” she added.\n\nDemocrats have found an unlikely ally in a Republican congressman who has proven a thorn in the side of Trump’s agenda.\n\nIn what the White House and Republican congressional leadership see as a distraction from the important work of funding the government before the September 30 deadline and messaging on Trump’s legislative successes heading towards the critical midterm elections, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) has been circulating a discharge petition to force a vote to release more Epstein documents.\n\nMassie has latched onto the files as his top priority after Trump’s political allies made clear their determination to defeat him in the 2026 primary, spending seven figures in ads against the Kentuckian who has bucked Trump on everything from government spending legislation to Trump’s big, beautiful bill.\n\nMassie told ABC News Sunday he will have the necessary 218 votes to force a vote on his discharge petition “by the end of September.” Only a handful of Republicans have joined Massie so far, and it remains possible Trump could convince them to remove their names from the discharge petition.\n\nWhether Americans, in Vance’s words, “[fall] for this BS” may not be determined until the midterms, but the timing of Democrats’ 2025 Epstein conversion does not lend to their sincerity.\n\nBradley Jaye is Deputy Political Editor for Breitbart News.

Discussing Biden’s use of the autopen, Fox’s Greg Gutfeld pressed Tarlov on how Democrats could stay in the party if it had “lied” to them about their president. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Trump Unveils New Troll Of Joe Biden’s Autopen In Oval Office)\n\n“Listen, I think there are some people who feel that way genuinely. And some people who usually vote for Democrats went out and voted for Trump in 2024,” Tarlov said. “I think that at the end of the day, though, people, I mean, this is a little bit different with Donald Trump, but at least on the Democratic side, since Obama, it’s not a cult of personality issue. It’s a set of policy preferences. And they like the Democratic policies better than Republican policies. They’ll show up to vote in the midterms and in 2028, based on that.”\n\n“As for, you know, the last-minute pardons for people that are personal. Every president does that. President Trump obviously did that down at the wire, even, for some people that we all know — ” Tarlov added before Fox’s Jesse Watters jumped in.\n\nIn December 2024, Biden granted clemency to nearly 1,500 individuals, including several Democratic politicians and public officials convicted on corruption charges. Biden also issued pardons to prominent figures, including his son Hunter Biden, Gen. Mark A. Milley and Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nAs questions about his mental fitness resurfaced, it was revealed in July that Biden authorized his staff to use his autopen to sign off on some pardons and clemencies. The former president claimed to The New York Times that he “made every decision,” directing his staff to use the autopen on clemency warrants due to the amount of people to review.\n\nWatters said Biden pardoned “crack dealers” and referenced the nearly 1,500 criminals granted clemency — some of whom were drug traffickers, cartel leaders, and fraudsters.\n\n“I’m separating them and saying there are personal pardons. And then there are these mass commutations. And the problem with a lot of them was that it didn’t go through the right DOJ channels. And even people like Senator Blumenthal, who’s been a big ally of President Biden, called it out and said, ‘Some of these must be a mistake,'” Tarlov said.\n\n“It seems to have come from the fact that there were state convictions versus federal charges. The federal charges were like a cocaine charge, but they had murdered someone and then they let them back out on the street,” Tarlov said. “So I would be for — and maybe we can all agree on this — that you have to personally go through absolutely all of it, including violent January 6 offenders.”\n\nQuestions about Biden’s mental fitness resurfaced with the release of a new book by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson, which detailed concerns among aides about the former president — including discussions about putting him in a wheelchair post-election due to his stiff gait.\n\nAlthough Biden insisted he personally approved the clemencies and pardons, an internal memo obtained by Just the News revealed that some of those duties were quietly delegated to others, including former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

HUD Secretary Scott Turner Aims to Revive It.","text":"This is a preview of this week’s episode of “The Signal Sitdown.” Don’t miss politics editor Bradley Devlin’s interview with Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner by turning on YouTube notifications for the premiere at 11 a.m. EST on Sept. 9.\n\nThe American dream is in crisis.\n\nA study published by Pew Research last year found that only 42% of adults under 50 say the American dream is still attainable. The belief is bipartisan: Only 38% of Democrats under 50 and 48% of Republicans under 50 believe it is possible to achieve the American dream.\n\nPresident Donald Trump felt the storm gathering. He turned heads when he descended down the golden escalator of Trump Tower in 2015 and thundered that “sadly, the American dream is dead.” He captured that lightning in a bottle not once but twice, observing that under former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, “you don’t hear about the American dream anymore—it’s dead.”\n\nAnd what’s the American dream without the white picket fence? Generations of Americans have grown up believing that owning a home has been a key tenet of living the American dream, but homes are increasingly unaffordable. For this monumental task, Trump has tapped Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner. Turner joined “The Signal Sitdown” this week to discuss a housing crisis that isn’t just about houses—it’s about the soul of our homeland.\n\nOne reason why young Americans and their families feel the American dream slipping away is the increasing unaffordability of a home for the average American. From the 1960s to the 1980s, the average house cost about three times the yearly median wage in America. Today, the average house costs seven times the yearly median wage.\n\nTurner told The Daily Signal that “there’s several factors” behind this trend. \n\n“The regulatory environment is crippling building,” Turner said. “Developers find it more difficult to develop, more difficult to build. And so, at [the Department of Housing and Urban Development], we’ve been very intentional from day one of taking inventory of our regulatory environment and the regulations that we have.” Cuts to those regulations have already started, with the Trump administration working to undo the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule, a Biden-era regulation that placed federal restrictions on using local land to build housing.\n\nIllegal immigration has been another factor. “When you look at our country and how between 10 and 20 million people came into our country illegally,” Turner continued, “this has hindered our housing industry and caused housing prices to go up.”\n\nTo no surprise, the average rent has nearly doubled over the same time period housing has more than doubled, even when adjusted for inflation. It’s a double blow for young Americans and their families hoping to buy a home. Higher housing costs force young Americans into renting, and high rents means less savings to someday afford a house.\n\nThe result? Many Americans have been forced to delay buying a home. In 2008, the average age of a first-time homebuyer was about 30, and it had been that way for three decades. Less than two decades later, and the average age of a first-time homebuyer is 38—an all-time high.\n\nTurner understands that having a country of renters is much different than a country of owners. \n\n“The American people, not only are they the one priority, they’re the only priority when it comes to HUD-funded housing,” Turner said. \n\n“We have to continue to work hard to make sure that those costs come down. When we came into this administration, our fiscal house was not in order,” Turner claimed. “The president and this administration under his leadership is getting our fiscal house in order.”\n\nPutting the nation’s fiscal house in order is necessary “to help people live lives of self-sustainability, to help people to achieve their American dream and home ownership, and to help people, really, to live out their God-given potential,” the HUD secretary added.\n\n“The American home is the American dream,” Turner said, “and at HUD we have the heart to help every American achieve the American dream.”","summary":"This is a preview of this week’s episode of “The Signal Sitdown.” Don’t miss politics editor Bradley Devlin’s interview with Housing and Urban Development Secretary...

And it proved I was wrong. I’m in the minority in my own country.”\n\nIt’s not the first time Hamill has expressed frustration over how Trump’s reelection reflects on the state of the United States. On Nov. 6 of last year, as the White House win solidified for Trump, the “Star Wars” icon memorably wrote on X: “They say we get the leaders we deserve. Either that has just been disproven, or this is not the America we all thought we were living in.”\n\nThey say we get the leaders we deserve.Either that has just been disproven, or this is not the America we all thought we were living in.— Mark Hamill (@MarkHamill) November 6, 2024\n\nSitting with Maron on Monday’s “WTF” episode, the star of “The Long Walk” reflected on filming “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” during Trump’s first presidential run against Hillary Clinton in 2016. \n\n“It was odd because when we were doing one of the sequels was the first time Hillary was running against him, and English people on the crew would come up to me and say, like, ‘Mark, why do Americans love Donald Trump so much?’” the 73-year-old actor recalled. “And I’m going, ‘I don’t know a single person who can stomach him.’”\n\nHe admitted to at one time thinking that Trump’s showmanship made him “amusing,” but that his perception changed in 2011 amid the soon-to-be politician’s public attacks on President Barack Obama’s birthplace.\n\n“I used to think, when I was living in New York doing theater, he was amusing to me. What’s not funny about a blowhard egomaniac with zero self-awareness?” Hamill said. “He was a buffoon.

Retired Army Col. Mark Bieger, president and CEO of the alumni group, emailed faculty that the ceremony was off. \n\n“This decision allows the Academy to continue its focus on its core mission of preparing cadets to lead, fight, and win as officers in the world’s most lethal force, the United States Army,” Bieger wrote, according to The Washington Post, which first reported the news that the ceremony got nixed.\n\nTrump, as usual, mixed up the academy and the alumni group, praising “our great West Point (getting greater all the time!)” as if the institution itself had made the call.\n\nThe episode is just the latest example of Trump’s long-standing feud with celebrities who surpass him in fame. Recall Taylor Swift, whom he called “no longer hot” (on two separate occasions) after she endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in 2024, only to change his tune after she got engaged last month to Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. \n\n“I wish them a lot of luck. I think he’s a great player. I think he’s a great guy, and I think that she’s a terrific person,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s target list extends beyond Swift. In May, he called for a “major investigation” into celebrity endorsements, claiming that Harris’ campaign must have illegally paid stars like Beyoncé, Bono, Oprah Winfrey, and Bruce Springsteen because they supported her over him. And last month, he suggested that he might personally look into NBC late-night host Seth Meyers after the network extended Meyers’ contract through 2028. Meyers, like other late-night hosts Trump despises, frequently criticizes the president.\n\nRelated | Trump picks more pointless fights with celebs as his agenda flops\n\nIn this context, his attack on Hanks fits a familiar pattern. Hanks has been a vocal supporter of former President Joe Biden, narrated a video marking the first anniversary of his presidency, and recently portrayed a racist Trump supporter on “Saturday Night Live.” Trump’s obsession with celebrities who challenge him politically, like Hanks, Springsteen, and Swift, is consistent and relentless.\n\nMeanwhile, Hanks’ record stands on its own. He’s a champion of U.S. service members and veterans, portraying them in films like “Saving Private Ryan” and “Forrest Gump,” and supporting memorials and museums nationwide. He has long supported Democrats, including Biden, who defeated Trump in 2020.\n\nTrump’s fixation with so-called cultural liberalism extends beyond Hollywood. Since returning to the White House, Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have been on a mission to root it out from the military, including phasing out “woke” diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. \n\nOn Monday, during a speech in Washington, Trump framed the West Point alumni group’s decision as part of that same effort, comparing it to pulling a stubborn “weed.” He also praised the cancellation as “appropriate” and urged other awards shows to follow suit. \n\n“Hopefully the Academy Awards, and other Fake Award Shows, will review their Standards and Practices in the name of Fairness and Justice,” he said. “Watch their DEAD RATINGS SURGE!”\n\nBut Hanks doesn’t need Trump’s approval. Two Oscars, seven Emmys, and eight Golden Globes demonstrate a career that speaks for itself—and he’s earned respect as a lifelong advocate for veterans and public service.","summary":"President Donald Trump had a full-on social media meltdown Monday, praising the alumni association at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point for “smartly” canceling an awards ceremony for actor, veterans advocate, and national treasure Tom Hanks.\n\n\n\n“Important move!” Trump raged on Truth Social. “We don’t need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards!!!”\n\n\n\n\n“The war on woke” by Clay Bennett\n\n\nThe ceremony, set for Sept. 25, would have honored Hanks with the Sylvanus Thayer Award, recognizing a non-West Point alum who embodies the academy’s ideals of “duty, honor, and country.” Hanks’ advocacy for veterans and his iconic portrayals of service members made him a natural pick.\n\n\n\nBut Friday brought a last-minute cancellation for reasons that remain unclear.

Gavin Newsom secured a long-awaited win against President Trump after a federal judge in San Francisco barred soldiers from aiding in immigration arrests and other civilian law enforcement across the state.\n\nThe decision follows months of feuding between Newsom and Trump, which recently escalated after the president deployed the National Guard in Los Angeles this past June.\n\nWhile the victory for Newsom and Democrats is clear, it also raises serious questions about how he and his party approach the issues of crime, law enforcement, and public order more generally. \n\nIndeed – unless there is a policy response that acknowledges these problems directly – the ruling could ultimately cast doubt on how seriously the Governor and his political allies take these critically important issues of public concern.\n\nA new poll from AP-NORC shows that an overwhelming majority (81%) think crime is a major concern in large cities and 66% say the same nationwide. It’s apparent that Americans consider crime a top issue – and if Democrats are looking to put MAGA to rest once and for all, they must stop defining themselves purely by opposition and finally get their policies right.\n\nIn 2024, much of former Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign was run on resistance to Trump. While that approach may have energized the base and generated short-term traction, it isn’t enough to sustain a competitive presidential campaign, especially this early in the 2028 cycle.\n\nNewsom – who is widely viewed as a leading contender for his party’s nomination – must be careful not to fall into that same trap. Although his sharp rhetoric against Trump and extremist Republicans plays well in CA, it risks pigeonholing him as a candidate who opposes plans more than he offers them.\n\nIn other words, for Newsom to be viable on the national stage, he’ll need to present an aggressive agenda that effectively addresses crime, public safety, immigration, and border control without harping on his disdain for Trump.\n\nPolling also shows that nearly two-thirds (62%) of Californians think it is important for the U.S. to secure its borders and stop the flow of illegal immigration, according to a survey from Politico/Citrin Center/Possibility Lab, although many disagree with the Trump administration’s harsh approach.\n\nTaken together, it’s evident that voters want balance – they value compassion but expect order. For Democrats, ignoring that relationship is politically dangerous.\n\nBut for Newsom, it might just be the perfect moment to position himself as a candidate who can garner support from Democrats, Independents, and swing voters alike.\n\nTo do so, he’ll have to reclaim the middle ground on crime and immigration, emphasizing both fairness and enforcement. While he proposed a plan earlier this year that would make illegal immigrants ineligible to apply for the state’s Medicare program, Newsom will need to do more to demonstrate to Californians – and ultimately voters across the country – that he’s serious about border control and national security.\n\nWe’ve already seen how running solely on anti-Trump sentiment doesn’t win elections, and the left cannot afford to make that mistake a second time. Democrats have the chance to rewrite the narrative and become the party that their voters want and need – but it will require much more than flashy slogans and social media engagement.\n\nRather, it calls for common-sense policies that appeal to voters who are tired of extremes on both sides of the aisle.\n\nAnd for Newsom specifically – as both governor of California and a viable option for the Oval Office – he must now prove that he can turn a symbolic courtroom victory into practical solutions on crime, immigration, and public safety.\n\nIf he gets it right, this ruling could serve as a launchpad for presidential ambitions.\n\nIf he fails, however, it will only highlight the weaknesses that could sink his candidacy before it even begins.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"We’ve already seen how running solely on anti-Trump sentiment doesn’t win elections, and the left cannot afford to make that mistake a second time.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/09/08/can-democrats-lead-on-crime-and-immigration-by-2028/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/LDN-L-NEWSOM-IMMIG-0717-DK-03.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-08 22:36:25","author":"Douglas Schoen","authors":["Douglas Schoen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.283},{"id":358687050,"title":"Fox News Politics Newsletter: LAPD pulls Harris security after union backlash","text":"Welcome to the Fox News Politics newsletter, with the latest updates on the Trump administration, Capitol Hill and more Fox News politics content.
