Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JASON CHESTER FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:18 GMT, 6 February 2025 |Updated:00:32 GMT, 6 February 2025 \n\nLiam Payne's bereaved girlfriend says she fell in love with the tragic star as a child after becoming a fan of his former band, One Direction. \nThe singer fell to his death from a third floor balcony following a drink and drug binge while staying at the upscale CasaSur hotel in Palermo on October 16, prompting a lengthy investigation into his movements and the actions of hotel employees during his final hours. \nPayne's American girlfriend Kate Cassidy had originally accompanied him to Argentina, ostensibly to watch his touring former bandmate Niall Horan perform at Buenos Aires venue Movistar Arena. \nBut the influencer had boarded a flight back to her Florida home little more than 24-hours before his death, aged just 31. \nReflecting on their relationship with The Sun, Cassidy, 25, admits she had a soft spot for the singer long before they met and embarked on a relationship that would see her accompany him on trips across the world. \nShe said:'Liam was my childhood crush. I have loved him since I was ten. I think we were meant to meet.\n\nLiam Payne 's bereaved girlfriend says she fell in love with the tragic star as a child after becoming a fan of his former band, One Direction\n\nThe singer shot to fame in 2010 on XFactor with former bandmates Niall Horan , Zayn Malik , Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson , despite initially auditioning separately.\n'Growing up, I had posters on walls. I think I had a One Direction one but I don’t know if I had his solo poster. But I did have him at some point on my wall.\n'He was genuinely one of the best people I’ve ever met in my life. I didn’t care about the other stuff. Our relationship was full of love and laughter and light.'\nCassidy originally met the singer in 2022 - six years after One Direction broke up - during a night out at a bar in Charleston, South Carolina. \nAfter swapping numbers they went bowling on their first date, but the influencer insists she didn't think it would blossom into a relationship. \nShe recalled: 'I was definitely kind of starstruck but mainly I was thinking about the connection we had. \n'We lived on different sides of the world. It didn’t occur to me we might end up dating.'\nPayne's medical cause of death has now been announced to be 'polytrauma', a term which means a person has multiple traumatic injuries to their body.\nFive people have been charged over his death in Argentina after he fell from a third-floor balcony of the CasaSur Hotel.\n\nCassidy is pictured attending late boyfriend Payne's funeral in Amersham on November 20 \n\n'He was genuinely one of the best people I’ve ever met in my life. I didn’t care about the other stuff. Our relationship was full of love and laughter and light'\n\n Liam Payne's heartbreaking final words on son Bear before shock death at age 31 \nThe hotel's manager, a receptionist and a friend of Payne have been charged with manslaughter, Argentina's National Criminal and Correctional Prosecutor's Office previously said in a statement.\nThey are reported to be hotel manager Gilda Martin, receptionist Esteban Grassi and Payne's friend Roger Nores. Two other people have been charged over the supply of drugs.\nBut due to the ongoing investigation, Cassidy could not divulge too much information and did not confirm whether or not she had spoken to Roger.\nShe insisted, however, that when she left Argentina, Payne was in 'such a good headspace' and the couple were more in love than ever.\nCassidy has dismissed cruel accusations that she abandoned the singer before his death, revealing that she had only returned to their Florida home to look after their rescue dog, Nala.\n\nPayne's American girlfriend Kate Cassidy had originally accompanied him to Argentina, ostensibly to watch his touring former bandmate Niall Horan perform in Buenos Aires\n\n Video shows Liam Payne singing and dancing at former bandmate Niall Horan's concert just days ago \nShe was home when she received the call telling her Payne had died.\nShe said it felt like a 'blackout moment', struggling to believe the news at first. She even tried calling his phone - and it still rang.\nThe content creator admitted she felt blessed that she did not receive the harrowing news via social media.\nInstead she had been in the comfort of their home with their beloved dog before one of Liam's friends called her.\nShe then contacted her boyfriend's family and her mother caught the first flight out to visit her grieving daughter as she attempted to process the devastating news.\nShe later realised that her last text to Payne had been completely ordinary: \"I can't wait for you to get home and see the house.\" She had spent time decorating for Halloween, excited to show him.\n\nThe influencer had boarded a flight back to her Florida home so she could take care of their rescue dog, little more than 24-hours before his death, aged just 31\n\nPayne's devastated fans embrace one another outside the CasaSur hotel in Buenos Aires following his tragic death last October \nThree days after his death, a worker she had hired to fix the decorations messaged, asking if Payne had liked the Halloween surprise.\nThat was the moment, she said, when it finally sank in that he was never coming home. \nPayne had spoken openly about his mental health struggles and past battles with addiction. He had tried both therapy and rehab.\nOn the night of his death, his hotel room was littered with drug paraphernalia and an opened champagne bottle.\nCassidy said his relapse seemed to come 'out of nowhere', and she had never imagined he was in such a fragile state.\nStill grieving, she has been seeing a grief therapist and struggles to listen to Liam's music. \n'Maybe one day,' she said, 'but not right now.'\n\nOne DirectionKate CassidyFloridaBuenos Aires\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLiam Payne's bereaved girlfriend Kate Cassidy says she was 'meant to meet' the tragic star after falling in love with him as a 10-year old One Direction fan - before embarking on a relationship 'filled with love and light'\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nLiam Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy breaks silence on star's final days and reveals why she left Argentina before his death\n\nTantrum - no tiara!

Some of her friends have advised her to go it alone and leave him,' the source shared.\n'His behavior is sometimes unacceptable. She's put up with a lot.'\nThe insider said Hailey and those close to her were hopeful that he would change after the arrival of their first child, son Jack Blues Bieber, in August 2024, but despite being there for her, little has changed.\n\nA source recently told DailyMail.com that Justin's weary look may be the result of him becoming 'borderline reclusive'; Bieber seen on January 30\n\nSources tell DailyMail.com that Hailey's friends are growing increasingly concerned about Justin's 'unacceptable behavior,' with some reportedly urging her to leave the musician\n'When the baby was born he was there for her and she thought being a father would change him for the better, but it hasn't stuck,' they added.\nLast week, Justin also attempted to debunk rumors of marital woes between him and his wife after setting the record straight about unfollowing her on Instagram.\nJust hours after insisting that his social media account was hacked, he returned to the app to share loved-up photos with Hailey from their trip to Aspen, Colorado.\nMystery surrounding the couple's marriage has intensified ever since he unfollowed his father-in-law Stephen Baldwin, furthering speculation of relationship woes and concern for the star after he also shared a picture of a bong.\nJustin BieberiPhoneGrammysHailey Baldwin\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJustin Bieber covers up at spa amid concerns over his appearance and Hailey divorce rumors\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nLiam Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy breaks silence on star's final days and reveals why she left Argentina before his death\n\nTantrum - no tiara!

executive order on Wednesday seeking to ban transgender athletes from participating in women's sports, in his latest move targeting transgender people since returning to office.\n\n\"From now on women's sports will be only for women,\" Trump said before he signed the order at the White House, surrounded by dozens of children and female athletes.\n\n\"With this executive order the war on women's sports is over.\" \n\nTop Republicans including US House Speaker Mike Johnson and firebrand Congresswoman Marjorie Green were among those in the audience to watch the signing ceremony.\n\n\"We will defend the proud tradition of female athletes, and we will not allow men to beat up, injure and cheat our women and our girls,\" Trump added to applause and cheers.\n\nTrump's order allows US government agencies to deny funds to schools that allow transgender athletes to compete on women's teams.\n\n\"If you let men take over women's sports teams or invade your locker rooms, you will be investigated... and risk your federal funding,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump said he would now push the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to change its rules on transgender athletes before the 2028 Los Angeles games.\n\nHe said he had ordered Secretary of State Marco Rubio to \"make it clear\" to the IOC that \"we want them to change everything having to do with the Olympics and having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject.\"\n\nTrump added that he had directed Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem to deny visa applications to \"made by men attempting to fraudulently enter the United States while identifying themselves as women athletes to try and get into the Games.\"\n\n- Culture war -\n\nRepublican Trump has repeatedly targeted gender non-conforming people in a blitz of orders pushing his radical right-wing agenda at the start of his second term.\n\nAt his inauguration speech Trump announced that US government policy would only recognize two genders, male and female -- ending the practice of providing a third gender option in some settings.\n\nDays later Trump signed an order to rid the military of what he called \"transgender ideology\" and effectively ban transgender troops. He also issued an order to restrict gender transition procedures for people under age 19.\n\nThe slew of actions comes despite the fact that transgender people make up only a small minority of the US population.\n\nDuring the 2024 election campaign he repeatedly hammered Democrats on the divisive issue of transgender rights during the 2024 election campaign, capitalizing on a broader culture war over the topic.\n\nOne of Trump's most successful attack lines against his election rival Kamala Harris -- \"Kamala Harris is for they/them. President Trump his for you\" -- targeted her support for trans rights.\n\nTrump also targeted her one-time support for gender reassignment operations for prisoners.\n\nHis executive order on Wednesday comes after the Republican-led House of Representatives in January passed a bill severely restricting transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.\n\nAs transgender people have become a more visible presence in the United States, sparking questions around gender norms and fairness, many conservatives have rallied around women's sports.","summary":"US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday seeking to ban transgender athletes from participating in women's sports, in his latest move targeting transgender people since returning to office.","url":"https://www.guampdn.com/news/national/trump-signs-order-barring-trans-athletes-from-womens-sports/article_a34fdebc-f74e-552b-9003-5a558da6e39b.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/guampdn.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/75/a75e4da7-fe46-5273-9583-104a551cae5c/67a3aad412db1.image.jpg?crop=340%2C340%2C86%2C0&resize=200%2C200&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-05 23:40:04","author":"Andrew Caballero,Danny KEMP","authors":["Andrew Caballero","Danny KEMP"],"language":"en","source_country":"gu","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":287517788,"title":"Kanye West slammed for criticizing Kim Kardashian's outfit years before Bianca Censori's naked Grammys stunt","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Feb 6th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiam Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy breaks silence on star's final days and reveals why she left Argentina before his death\n\nTrump declares war on women's sports is OVER as he unveils plan to ban trans athletes from Olympics\n\nDeath toll in Congo uprising nears 3,000 including scores of female inmates who were raped and burned alive with their children when women's jail was stormed: Corpses pile up in streets as Rwanda-backed rebels go on rampage\n\nTHIS is washing up on UK beaches and could kill your dog: Urgent warning as at least four pets die with more sickened\n\nWe've all seen those 2am texts between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni - and we all know what they REALLY mean: AMANDA PLATELL\n\nGrenfell Tower to be demolished: Bereaved families are told by Angela Rayner that 24-storey block will be ripped down nearly eight years after 72 people were killed in fire\n\nTantrum... but no tiara!

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy DEIRDRE DURKAN-SIMONDS FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:23:18 GMT, 5 February 2025 |Updated:23:39 GMT, 5 February 2025 \n\nKanye West is getting branded a hypocrite for encouraging his wife Bianca Censori to dress provocatively after previously pleading with ex Kim Kardashian to cover up. \nAfter Censori, 30, sparked outrage for exposing herself in a see-through dress at the 2025 Grammys on Sunday, numerous social media users reacted to a resurfaced video of him telling Kardashian it 'hurt' his soul when she wore revealing outfits.\nFootage from season 17 of Keeping Up With The Kardashians shows West shaming Kardashian for dressing 'too sexy' ahead of her imminent Met Gala appearance. \nAfter spending eight months perfecting her Thierry Mugler look for the event, the reality star was left 'anxiety' ridden when her husband criticized her appearance at the last minute.\nIn the episode, which aired in 2019, West made it clear he wasn't a fan of his then-wife's custom-made, nude-colored corset, designed to look like as though she was dripping wet. \nAs he took in the look, the rapper frowned at the style of her dress as he declared it didn't match with his personal evolution from being a single guy to a married man.\n\nAfter making headlines for her latest scandalous stunt at the 2025 Grammy Awards on Sunday, which involved exposing herself to the world, DailyMail.com took a look back on the Australian designer's past as old photos of her have resurfaced\n\n'I just made this transition from being a rapper, looking at all these girls, looking at my wife,' he mused. 'Like, ''Oh, my girl needs to be like the other girls, showing her body off''.'\n'I didn't realize that that was affecting my soul and my spirit as someone that's married and loved, and the father of now, what—about to be four kids?,' Kanye said.\n\nEXCLUSIVE Taylor Swift's pointed clapback at Kanye West's attempt at a Grammys photo \nAt the time, Kanye and Kim were just days away from becoming parents to their fourth child Psalm, who they welcomed via a surrogate.\n'A corset is like a form of underwear,' Kanye continued. 'It's hot. It's like, it's hot for who, though?'\n'So the night before the Met, you're gonna come in here and say that you're not into a corset bust?' Kim asked. 'I'm getting really bad anxiety. What are you talking about?'\n'I don't need any more negative energy for you to now say that you're not into me in a tight dress,' she pointed out.\n'You are my wife, and it affects me when pictures are too sexy,' Kanye said.\n'You built me up to be this sexy person and confidence and all this stuff,' Kim adroitly pointed out. \n\nAfter spending eight months perfecting her Thierry Mugler look for the event , the reality star was left 'anxiety' ridden when her husband criticized her appearance at the last minute\n\nIn the episode, which first aired in 2019, West made it clear he wasn't a fan of his then-wife's waist-cinching look corseted look, which prevented her from sitting down or going to the bathroom.\n\nAs he took in the look, the rapper frowned at the underwear style of her dress, announcing at her last fitting that it didn't match with his personal evolution from being a single guy to a married man\n'And just because you're on a journey and you're on a transformation doesn't mean that I'm in the same spot with you.' \nThis prompts West to storm off after saying: 'All right, cool.'\n'That's absolutely ridiculous,' Kim muttered.\n'Well this didn't age well,' one wrote, days after his current wife's indecent exposure stunt broke the internet. \nAnother wrote: 'But then he's ok with Bianca Censori's Grammy fit.'\n\n'I just made this transition from being a rapper, looking at all these girls, looking at my wife,' he mused. 'Like, ''Oh, my girl needs to be like the other girls, showing her body off'''\n\nKanye, then asked: 'corset is like a form of underwear... It's hot. It's like, it's hot for who, though?'\n\n'Well this didn't age well,' one social media user wrote, days after the indecent exposure stunt broke the internet\n\n'Kanye West told Kim Kardashian that the sexy dress she wore to the met gala \"hurt his soul\" and she had way more covered than this,' a third X user tweeted. 'That tells you how he feels about his new wife—who is NOT the mother of any of his children'\n'Kanye West told Kim Kardashian that the sexy dress she wore to the met gala \"hurt his soul\" and she had way more covered than this,' a third X user tweeted. 'That tells you how he feels about his new wife—who is NOT the mother of any of his children.'\nA fourth wrote: 'Kanye is weird and I need y’all to stop defending his behavior... he’s a hypocrite.' \nIn a similar tweet, another critic wrote: 'Kanye is such a hypocrite cuz he used to shame Kim K for waaaaay less talking about how she’s not a good example for their kids.'\nFollowing backlash over her remarks over her look, at the time, West doubled down on his stance while appearing on Beats 1's Zane Lowe on Apple Music.\n'I suffer and I appreciate the suffering because we can feel a little bit of what Jesus experienced, but I suffer on social media,' Kanye said. 'There are other married men that I know are happy to hear me say that.'\nHe continued: 'Social media prompts women, in particular, to put out content that they wouldn’t in the past. When I was younger and I wanted to see something like that I had to pay someone who was older … Now I have friends who have kids in high school and it’s readily available.' \n\n'Kanye West told Kim Kardashian that the sexy dress she wore to the met gala \"hurt his soul\" and she had way more covered than this,' a third X user tweeted. 'That tells you how he feels about his new wife—who is NOT the mother of any of his children'\n\nA fourth wrote: 'Kanye is weird and I need y’all to stop defending his behavior... he’s a hypocrite'\n\nIn a similar tweet, another critic wrote: 'Kanye is such a hypocrite cuz he used to shame Kim K for waaaaay less talking about how she’s not a good example for their kids'\n\nMultiple X users called West's behavior hypocritical\nWest's opinion about how his wife should dress drastically changed after finalizing his high-profile divorce from Kardashian in 2022. \nSince walking down the aisle with Censori, the rapper has encouraged his wife to wear a number of very racy looks, which have caused a stir online. \nMost recently, the duo shocked the world after she bared it all in a sheer nude mesh dress worn without underwear at the Grammy Awards. \nOn Tuesday, a source close to her husband told the New York Post claimed that Censori was 'talked into' wearing her shocking nude dress.\n'She would have much rather worn a pretty dress,' said the source. 'She would have enjoyed the evening a lot more.'\nWest is said to have lost a $20 million deal to play in Japan as a result of his controversial stunt.\nA source said: 'Kanye is just ****ing up every opportunity that comes to him. The stunt was creepy beyond belief and has been greeted with horror in Japan.'\nHe added: 'Japan is having a cultural awakening about women's rights and the MeToo movement is really strong here. What he did is being seen as an act of coercive control which is utterly unacceptable. He has completely culturally misjudged Japan.'\n\nWest's opinion about how his wife should dress since finalizing his high-profile divorce from Kardashian in 2022\n\nThis is unfortunate as he has been living in a hotel in Tokyo for most of the last year.\nA source said: 'The investors in Japan who are backing the concerts are extremely upset by this. It is highly likely that they will pull the funding for the shows.\n'He has greatly misjudged the tolerance of the Japanese people towards these activities. He's just not welcome any more.\n'This will be a big blow for him because he has been living in Japan for around a year now, almost full time, and I guess he did not see this coming.'\nThere is also fury among his American colleagues and backers over the stunt which was pulled in front of billboards asking for charitable donations to aid those who lost their homes and their lives in the wildfires in Los Angeles earlier this month.\nOne said: 'This was totally disrespectful to the Grammys. To pull a stunt at what is essentially a fundraiser and in the context of what has been going on in LA is almost inconceivably stupid, crass and wrong.'\n'It's a **** up on a huge scale, but all that Kanye is interested in at the moment is launching his cryptocurrency, and everything else seems to pass him by.\nKanye WestKim KardashianJapanBianca Censori\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKanye West slammed for criticizing Kim Kardashian's outfit years before Bianca Censori's naked Grammys stunt\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nLiam Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy breaks silence on star's final days and reveals why she left Argentina before his death\n\nTantrum - no tiara!

Meet the Biden-era USAID leader facing backlash amid Musk's DOGE crackdown","text":"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has recently become the target of Elon Musk’s DOGE efforts to slash government waste and spending, bringing increased scrutiny to the record of Samantha Power, the agency’s administrator during almost the entire Biden administration. Power, who previously served as the United States ambassador to the United Nations from 2013 to 2017 in the Obama administration after serving on his National Security Council, took the reins of USAID in the early days of the Biden administration and was tasked with overseeing the tens of billions of dollars budgeted for foreign aid. \"One of the most pressing challenges facing our nation is restoring and strengthening America's global leadership as a champion of democracy, human rights, and the dignity of all people,\" then-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris said in a statement at the time of Power’s appointment. \"Few Americans are better equipped to help lead that work than Ambassador Samantha Power.\" Power was directly involved in the Obama administration’s surveillance of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and sought to obtain Michael Flynn's redacted identity using an \"unmasking\" request on at least seven occasions, Fox News Digital previously reported, despite testifying under oath before the House Intelligence Committee that she had \"no recollection\" of ever making such a request even once. USAID CLOSES HQ TO STAFFERS MONDAY AS MUSK SAYS TRUMP SUPPORTS SHUTTING AGENCY DOWN Fox News reported in 2017 that Power was \"unmasking\" at such a rapid pace in the final months of the Obama administration that she averaged more than one request for every working day in 2016, and she even sought information in the days leading up to President Trump’s inauguration, according to multiple sources close to the matter. Power’s tenure at USAID was also not without controversy, even from her own party, including an incident in which she faced a public revolt from current and former staff in 2024 over her support of Israel. Critics also took issue with her repeatedly meeting with influential liberal foundations while serving in her role at USAID, which Fox News Digital reported in 2023, included George Soros' Open Society Foundations at least two times, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation at least five times, and meetings with several other powerful groups like Ford and Rockefeller foundations. Power’s supporters say she has played a critical role in providing U.S. assistance to war-torn areas like Ukraine and Gaza along with aiding the relief of humanitarian crises that have developed in places like Haiti, Armenia and Sudan. \"The best testament to USAID’s contribution is the surge in PRC-backed and Russian-backed propaganda maligning USAID and our work around the world,\" Power said in an exit interview with Politico last month. \"And it’s really picked up a lot over the last year and a half. We counted 81 malicious and false propaganda campaigns, really dedicated campaigns, aimed at denigrating USAID and our reputation. So we’re doing something that is getting on their nerves.\" USAID HAS 'DEMONSTRATED PATTERN OF OBSTRUCTIONISM,' CLAIMS TOP DOGE REPUBLICAN IN LETTER TO RUBIO Power, who is married to former Obama administration official and professor Cass Sunstein, added, \"We are an agency that has thousands of people around the world representing the United States, both because it’s in the interests of the American people to have health systems that are more secure and can spot infectious diseases and tackle them, to change regulations so it’s easier for American businesses to invest, but also to show up and to show the importance of investing in the partnership — and not investing in a manner that just leaves countries saddled with debt.\" USAID has been increasingly questioned by Republicans over its alleged funding of research relating to the coronavirus at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, as well as millions in aid that supports LGBT rights abroad and dozens of millions of dollars for migrant crises in other countries, like the nearly $45 million slated to provide emergency food assistance and economic support for Venezuelan migrants in Colombia. MEET THE YOUNG TEAM OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERS SLASHING GOVERNMENT WASTE AT DOGE: REPORT Democrats counter that the agency plays a vital role in U.S. national security interests and say it should remain independent. They point to the work USAID did to counter Soviet influence during the Cold War, a sphere of influence that could remain a concern amid China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Tech billionaire and DOGE Chair Elon Musk has been on a warpath against USAID, which is an independent U.S. agency that was established under the Kennedy administration to administer economic aid to foreign nations, as he leads DOGE’s mission of cutting government fat and overspending at the federal level. Musk announced in an audio-only message on X over the weekend that \"we’re in the process\" of \"shutting down USAID.\" \"On Friday, February 7, 2025, at 11:59 pm (EST) all USAID direct hire personnel will be placed on administrative leave globally, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership and specially designated programs,\" USAID's website currently says. \"Essential personnel expected to continue working will be informed by Agency leadership by Thursday, February 6, at 3:00pm (EST).\" A Fox News Digital review of USAID’s recent history shows that it has repeatedly been accused of financial mismanagement and corruption long before Trump's second administration, with spending that took place under Power’s reign likely to continue to be a focus of conversation with Republicans. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., sent a letter to Power in October 2024, sounding the alarm on the \"likely misuse of more than one billion dollars in U.S. humanitarian aid sent to Gaza since October 2023,\" Fox Digital reported at the time. A Syrian national named Mahmoud Al Hafyan, 53, was charged in November 2024 for allegedly diverting more than $9 million in U.S.-funded humanitarian aid to terrorist groups, including the Al-Nusrah Front. The Al-Nusrah Front, also known as Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, is a designated terrorist organization with ties to al-Qaeda, according to the State Department. The Government Accountability Office published a report in 2023 finding that both USAID and the National Institutes of Health directed taxpayer funds to American universities and a nonprofit organization before the money found its way to Chinese groups, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Eight auditors and employees for the USAID inspector general’s office sounded the alarm to the Washington Post in 2014 that negative findings surrounding the agency’s work were removed from final reports and audits. Trump repeatedly proposed slashing the nation’s foreign aid budget for USAID and the State Department during his first administration, including proposing in his first year in office to slash the budgets by 37%, which Congress rejected. \"With $20 trillion in debt, the government must learn to tighten its belt,\" Trump said in 2017 while advocating for the cuts. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Power sat down with late-night host Stephen Colbert on Tuesday night and defended USAID's work and warned against shutting it down, claiming that children overseas in line for tuberculosis treatment were told to go home as a result of Trump's executive order. \"Programs that were running, the people we’re depending on, in some cases, for life-saving medicine, like medicine, if you have HIV, that keeps you alive, quite literally,\" Power told Colbert. \"Or if you’re in Sudan and you have a child who’s wasting away because of malnutrition, a miracle paste, a peanut paste that USAID provides brings that kid back from the brink of death. All of those programs are shuttered.\" Democrat lawmakers took part in a rally against DOGE on Tuesday outside the Treasury Department, arguing that Musk's actions are unconstitutional and a threat to Democracy. \"My heart is with the people out on the street outside USAID, but my head tells me, ‘Man, Trump will be well satisfied to have this fight,’\" veteran strategist David Axelrod, who served with Power in the Obama administration, said this week. \"When you talk about cuts, the first thing people say is: Cut foreign aid.\" Fox News Digital’s Caitlin McFall, Emma Colton and Gregg Re contributed to this report","summary":"USAID, which has become the focus of Elon Musk&apos;s DOGE efforts in recent days, was led by Obama admin alum Samantha Power from 2021 until Trump took office in January.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/who-is-samantha-power-meet-biden-era-usaid-leader-facing-backlash-musks-doge-crackdown","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/02/931/523/paper-tear-3-1.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-05 23:38:26","author":"Andrew Miller","authors":["Andrew Miller"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.144},{"id":287518110,"title":"Travis Kelce’s Thoughts on Donald Trump Attending Super Bowl | Billboard News","text":"Ahead of the Super Bowl this upcoming Sunday, Travis Kelce shared his thoughts on President Donald Trump attending the big game. \n\n What do you think about his response?

Listen here\n\nBy RACHEL BOWMAN and CLAUDIA AORAHA FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 22:13 GMT, 5 February 2025 | Updated: 23:10 GMT, 5 February 2025\n\nAll of the damning moments that CBS edited out of their interview with Kamala Harris have been laid bare - after the Federal Communications Commission ordered for the original to be made public. \n\nDonald Trump claimed the sit-down had been rigged - and the unearthed version now shows that CBS only aired 20 minutes of Kamala Harris talking, compared to 60 minutes that were filmed. \n\nThe FCC released the interview on Wednesday after Trump sued CBS News in October, claiming the network purposely edited the interview to put him at a disadvantage in the presidential election.\n\nThe unedited clip opens with the former VP sneezing as she explains she is 'allergic to mold,' while other sections of her answers were cropped and cut out completely. \n\nIn other places, Kamala Harris gave rambled answers on why she should be president, foreign policy, and Donald Trump - all which were quietly nipped by CBS. \n\nThe full version of the interview shows that while Harris gave a lengthy answer when asked about Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, CBS only aired about seven seconds on 60 Minutes.\n\nHere are the damning differences between the scripts and what made it on air. \n\nCBS has released the unedited version of their interview with Kamala Harris after Donald Trump claimed it had been rigged\n\nHarris slamming Trump as a 'racist' is edited out\n\nThe long version of the CBS interview revealed that the network cut out an entire answer Kamala Harris dedicated to slamming Donald Trump as a racist. \n\nInterviewer Bill Whitaker asked the then-Vice President: 'And talking about that person you're mentioning right now, you have accused Donald Trump of using racist tropes when it comes to Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, when it comes to birtherism, when it comes to Charlottesville. \n\n'In fact, you have called him a racist, and divisive. Yet Donald Trump has the support of millions and millions of Americans. How do you explain that?'\n\nKamala Harris' answer to this question was completely cut from the CBS episode.\n\nIn the uncut version, Harris bashed Trump for having a 'bouquet of microphones' at his disposal, and for his 'most vile lies' about people in Springfield, Ohio.\n\nThe reference is to the comments Trump made last year, about illegal migrants in the midwestern state eating people's dogs.\n\nIn the unearthed version, Kamala also made a bizarre boast about how when she was DA in California, 'the words I spoke could move markets.'\n\nIn the deleted version of the interview, Harris then went on a strange rant about school kids' picture day that they seemingly missed as a result of Trump's words about Springfield, Ohio. \n\nShe responded: 'So let's just break down what you just talked about, and talk about it in the context of the words that Donald Trump has spoken, and the actions he has taken, and whether that is reflective of who we are as Americans, knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us. \n\n'We have a former President who wants to be President again, who has a bouquet of microphones in front of him, who has said the most vile lies about a group of legal immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. And if I may, Bill, let me just say something. \n\n'You know, from the time I was a prosecutor, to attorney general, to now I'm Vice President, I learned very early in my career when the voters bestow on you the authority to have these positions, you must be very thoughtful about how you use that microphone in front of you. \n\n'And you know, when I was attorney general, the words I spoke could move markets. \n\n'So the idea that the former president, who again is running to be President, would use that microphone in a way that is about vilifying and demeaning a whole population of people, you know what has happened because of that? \n\n'One day when this happened was a school day, picture day for an elementary school. Picture day. You know what picture day is for our children. They get excited the night before when you put out the clothes they're going to wear, they go to school making sure their faces are clean, and their hair is done, and they go to school for picture day. You know what happened to these children? They had to evacuate that day because of the fear of the threats that were being issued in Springfield because of the words of Donald Trump.' \n\nInstead of airing this section, the cut version on CBS was far less explosive against the Republican - and contained far fewer words.\n\nIn the aired version, Kamala Harris was broadcasted as saying: 'So I say that I'm glad you're pointing these comments out that he has made, that have resulted in a response by most reasonable people to say it's just wrong. It's just wrong.' \n\nInterviewer Bill Whitaker sat down with the then-VP - but the majority of what he asked was not aired \n\nHarris' answers on Israel are edited out\n\nThe interviewer asked: 'What can the U.S. do at this point to stop this from spinning out 8 of control?'\n\nHer response, which was aired, went as follows: 'Well, let's start with October 7. 1,200 people were massacred, 250 hostages 15 were taken, including Americans, women were brutally raped. And as I said then, I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end.'\n\nBut the next section of her answer was completely edited out of the interview, the newly-released script revealed: 'And that [the war ending] has to be our number one imperative, and that has been our number one imperative.'\n\nUnprompted, Harris then asked herself a rhetorical question - and gave a round-a-bout, lengthy, repetitive answer. This part was removed from the original broadcast. \n\nHarris said: 'How can we get this war to end?\n\n'Well, critical elements of that are we have got to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done. We have to - we have to get aid in. We have to lay the path toward a two-state solution. I do believe that we must maintain that as an objective, no matter how out of reach it seems at the moment. And the work that we have to do is also pay attention to what is happening every day in the region and put U.S. resources into everything we can do, diplomatically and otherwise, to de-escalate what is happening in the region.' \n\nCBS edited Whitaker's question to Harris about Netanyahu not listening to the United States - where he cited reporting from The Wall Street Journal that the administration has repeatedly been blindsided by the Israeli PM.\n\nHarris responded by boasting about the work they have done with Israel and cropped her answer down to just: 'We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.'\n\nHarris' answers on Iranian threat are edited out\n\nWhitaker asked Harris a pointed, simple question about foreign policy - that was completely left out of the version CBS aired in October. \n\nHe asked the former VP: 'Let's hit on some more foreign policy. Which foreign country do you consider to be our greatest adversary?'\n\nKamala Harris' answer was Iran - followed by a series of rambling sentences. \n\nShe said: 'Well, there are different reasons that we should be thoughtful about each. Most recently, I think there's an obvious one in mind, which is Iran. And look, I mean, Iran has American blood on their hands, okay? \n\n'And what we saw in terms of just this attack on Israel, 200 ballistic 11 missiles, what we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power, that is one of my highest priorities. And that must be.' \n\nThe interviewer pushed her further, asking a question about what she would do if she - as the hypothetical President - found out the Middle Eastern power was building a nuclear arsenal. \n\nHe asked: 'So if you have proof that Iran is building a nuclear weapon, would you take military action?'\n\nBut instead of taking the bait, Harris turned down the question completely. \n\nShe responded: 'I'm not going to talk about hypotheticals at this moment.'\n\nThis entire conversation was edited out of the broadcast by CBS. \n\nHarris' answer on why she should be president is trimmed\n\nWhitaker asked Harris why a quarter of voters feel they don't know her - despite having served as the vice president for four years.\n\nThe newly-released transcript showed that CBS omitted a large chunk of Harris' bizarre, digressive words about 'traveling the country' - rather than actually saying why she ought to be Commander-in-Chief. \n\n'But Madam Vice 21 President, a quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you, they don't know what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? I mean, you have been vice president for almost four years. You've been on the national scene for longer. What's the disconnect?' Whitaker asked. \n\nIn both the edited and aired versions, Harris started her response with: 'It's an election, Bill. And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote.'\n\nHowever, CBS edited out her next few sentences. 'And that's why I'm traveling our country. I've seen you in a few states in the last couple of days. I'm talking with folks where they live. I'm listening to folks. And working to earn the vote of every American,' Harris said.\n\nBoth versions continued: 'This is an election for president of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support. You have to earn it. And that's what I intend to do.'\n\nHarris' answer on NATO and the war in Ukraine is trimmed\n\nWhen asked if she would expand NATO to include Ukraine if she were President, CBS cropped down Harris' response and jumped to her slamming Trump. \n\n'How about as President, would you support the effort to expand NATO to include Ukraine?' Whitaker asked.\n\n'Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression,' Harris said.\n\nThe transcript showed Harris actually said: 'And doing what we can to continue to build and strengthen the alliance around the support for Ukraine's right to be an independent nation, free from having its borders forcefully taken by Russia. \n\n'And we are going to continue to work closely with our NATO allies to continue to reinforce America's alliance in the context of NATO. Again, in this election, there's a real difference between me and the former president. \n\n'I believe in reinforcing the strength of NATO, understanding again it is the greatest military alliance the world has ever known. Donald Trump would pull us out of NATO.'\n\nHowever, CBS removed her speaking about what the Biden administration was doing to support Ukraine - before just showing her blasting Trump. \n\nThe version that aired on 60 Minutes jumped to Harris stating: 'Donald Trump, if he were President, Putin would be sitting in Kiev right now. Let's be clear about that. He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It's about surrender.' \n\nDonald Trump claimed the sit-down had been rigged - and the unearthed version now shows that CBS only aired 20 minutes of Kamala Harris talking , compared to 60 minutes that were filmed\n\nThe unedited clip opens with the former VP sneezing as she explains she is 'allergic to mold,' while other sections of her answers were cropped and cut out completely\n\nHarris' economic plan answer is chopped up \n\nWhen Whitaker asked Harris how she intended to pay for her economic plan, CBS edited out her answer on inflation.\n\n'It is estimated by the Nonpartisan Committee for Responsible Federal Budget that your economic plan would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. How are you going to pay for that?' Whitaker asked.\n\nCBS kept the first sentence of the former vice president's response, 'Okay so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent.'\n\nBut the transcript showed CBS sliced up her answer by removing the next part of her sentence.\n\n'Because this is an election and there are two choices, everyone from Goldman Sachs to Moody's to Nobel laureates, so on the first point, comparing my economic plan to Donald Trump's economic plan, they have reviewed it,' Harris continued.\n\nThe aired version pieced her first sentence with this bit she said later on. 'And determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy, his would weaken it,' Harris said.\n\nAgain, CBS removed her repeated ranting about analyst and a portion where she where she talked about inflation. \n\nHarris said in the original transcript: 'Sixteen Nobel laureates, Moody's, others have determined, after reviewing what Donald Trump is proposing, that he would induce inflation, increase inflation, and bring about a recession by the middle of next year.'\n\nThey aired the last of her response, 'My plan, Bill, if you don't mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy.'\n\nHarris' answers on China and Taiwan are edited out\n\nAsking the then-VP a question about China, Whitaker said: 'What about China? China is strongly asserting its dominance, its control of the South China Sea, especially around the Philippines. What is the U.S. responsibility for keeping China from simply taking over the South China Sea?' \n\nHarris' answer, which was completely cut from the broadcast, read: 'Well, I have actually worked very closely with the leaders in the Philippines on just this very issue, and including the work that we are doing in terms of coordination between our military and training, and what needs to happen in terms of protecting the freedom of the South China Sea.'\n\nThe next section was also cut, apart from a voice over of Harris saying: 'We must win the competition for the 21st century with China.' \n\nThe full, unaired quote, read: 'China, first of all, we must win the competition for the 21st century with China. We must be able to compete and win. We should not seek conflict, but we have to understand that there are parameters in which we must operate that include ensuring, for example, that we protect American business interests. What we -'\n\nWhitaker said: 'So say if China attacks Taiwan. Would we use military force to support Taiwan?'\n\nHarris refused to give a straight answer - and instead gave a flurried answer about fentanyl.\n\nShe said: 'Bill, I'm not going to get into hypotheticals. But listen, we need to make sure that we maintain a one-China policy, and - but that includes supporting Taiwan's ability to defend itself, including what we need to do to ensure the freedom of the Taiwan Strait. \n\n'But on the issue of China, we also - again, these are not - We cannot afford to have foreign policy that is myopic. We must be able to also, as it relates to China, continue to do the work that we have begun to deal with the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States. That's a real issue. Again, you talk to families around our country who have -- I just, on a constant, sadly, regular basis meet parents and family members of people who have died from fentanyl, young people who have died from fentanyl. \n\n'Are we going to stop trying to stem the flow from fentanyl? And we have to deal with that, and understand China's role in that, and our ability to work with China to stop that flow. Which we have begun to do, and I'm going to continue to do. We need to make sure we have open lines of communication with China, in particular military to military. So these issues are all - they're multifaceted.' \n\nCBS cuts crucial line from Harris' answer on the border crisis \n\nThe network cut one very crucial line from Kamala Harris' answer about the border crisis. \n\nShe was asked: 'You recently visited the southern border, and embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers. And that crackdown produced an almost immediate and dramatic decrease in the number of border crossings, and you said you would take it even further. If that's the right answer now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?'\n\nThe answer she gave that was aired - and the one that was filmed - were nearly identical. \n\nHarris said on the CBS broadcast: 'So we came into office, and almost hours, Bill, after our inauguration, the first bill we proposed to Congress was to fix our broken immigration system, knowing that if you want to actually fix it, we need Congress to act. It was not taken up. Fast forward to a moment when a bipartisan group of members of the United States Senate, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, got together, came up with a border security bill...'\n\nIn the aired version, Kamala Harris then went on to describe what happened next.\n\nBut the unedited version revealed that CBS left out three key words at the end of her speech about the border crisis bill. \n\n'...Which I support.' \n\nChinaKamala HarrisDonald TrumpIranOhio\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nAll the damning moments CBS edited out of Kamala Harris controversial 60 Minutes interview\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Donald Trump claimed the sit-down had been rigged - and the unearthed version now shows that CBS only aired 20 minutes of Kamala Harris talking, compared to 60 minutes that were filmed.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14365391/cbs-kamala-harris-interview-damning-differences-60-minutes.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/05/22/94906937-0-image-m-7_1738793594960.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/10/08/7932431385056137168/1024x576_MP4_7932431385056137168.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-05 23:10:55","author":"Claudia Aoraha,Editor,Rachel Bowman","authors":["Claudia Aoraha","Editor","Rachel Bowman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.16},{"id":287511376,"title":"Marcus Jordan 'demanded cops play Mariah Carey' after shock cocaine possession arrest","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Feb 6th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiam Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy breaks silence on star's final days and reveals why she left Argentina before his death\n\nTrump declares war on women's sports is OVER as he unveils plan to ban trans athletes from Olympics\n\nDeath toll in Congo uprising nears 3,000 including scores of female inmates who were raped and burned alive with their children when women's jail was stormed: Corpses pile up in streets as Rwanda-backed rebels go on rampage\n\nTHIS is washing up on UK beaches and could kill your dog: Urgent warning as at least four pets die with more sickened\n\nWe've all seen those 2am texts between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni - and we all know what they REALLY mean: AMANDA PLATELL\n\nGrenfell Tower to be demolished: Bereaved families are told by Angela Rayner that 24-storey block will be ripped down nearly eight years after 72 people were killed in fire\n\nTantrum... but no tiara!

One USAID staffer who wished to remain anonymous told Fox News Digital that 80% of staff across its bureaus learned they lost access to the agency’s systems on Monday morning, including travel, communications, classified information and databases – leading to questions about how to repatriate American citizens in some of the most dangerous places in the world should the need arise. Staffers also feel they were \"left high and dry\" and \"have no idea what to do or where to turn\" after being \"abandoned by Congress and the government,\" the source said, adding they felt the agency was \"hostilely taken over by DOGE.\"…Read more DOGE 'OBSTRUCTION': USAID has 'demonstrated pattern of obstructionism,' claims top DOGE Republican in letter to Rubio…Read more 'BIG MONEY FRAUD': DOGE targets Medicare agency, looking for fraud…Read more DOGE HOUSE: White House calls Democrat criticism of DOGE 'unacceptable' and 'incredibly alarming'…Read more 'DOGE FEVER': States from NJ to TX draft similar initiatives as federal leaders celebrate…Read more White House GAZA DEPLOYMENTS?: Trump not committing to putting US troops in Gaza…Read more CAUGHT ON CAMERA: Authorities nab White House fence climber just two weeks into Trump's new term…Read more STRATEGY SESSION: Trump to holding Oval Office meeting with Texas Gov.

It’s a great honor,” he told the press on February 5. However, Kelce did fall short of a full-blown endorsement of POTUS. “You know, no matter who the president is,” the tight end added before referring to America as “the best country in the world.” His response was somewhat surprising considering the president’s contentious relationship with his girlfriend, Taylor Swift. Swift was blasted by Trump after she endorsed Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election in September 2024. Trump did not mince words and wasted no time firing back at the pop star. “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” he wrote on Truth Social.\n\nPreviously, Kelce came under fire for not sharing Swift’s political convictions. A day after Trump was voted into office, the “New Heights” podcaster took to Instagram to upload a carousel of snaps that featured the Chiefs playing at Arrowhead Stadium. Swifties accused Kelce of failing to “read the room” after Trump’s election victory.\n\nTrump’s name hasn’t only been linked to Kelce and his girlfriend but to the tight end’s teammate Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany Mahomes. At the pre-Super Bowl presser, Patrick was also asked to comment on Trump attending the big game. “It’s always cool to be able to play in front of a sitting president,” the quarterback replied, rather diplomatically. Early in the season, Trump had name-dropped Brittany, whom he called a supporter on Truth Social. Meanwhile, Brittany’s reported backing of her BFF Trump caused a firestorm of controversy online.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n&#013; &#013; &#013; Don Juan Moore/Getty Images Leading up to Donald Trump&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Travis Kelce is excited about Brittany Mahomes&#8217; friend, Trump, attending the 2025 Super Bowl first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-lifestyle/travis-kelce-is-excited-about-brittany-mahomes-friend-trump-attending-the-2025-super-bowl/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rewrite-this-title-Travis-Kelce-Gushes-Over-Brittany-Mahomes-BFF.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-05 22:46:23","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.207},{"id":287502046,"title":"Critical moments omitted by CBS from Kamala Harris’ controversial 60 Minutes interview","text":"All of the damning moments that CBS edited out of their interview with Kamala Harris have been laid bare – after the Federal Communications Commission ordered for the original to be made public. \n\nDonald Trump claimed the sit-down had been rigged – and the unearthed version now shows that CBS only aired 20 minutes of Kamala Harris talking, compared to 60 minutes that were filmed. \n\nThe FCC released the interview on Wednesday after Trump sued CBS News in October, claiming the network purposely edited the interview to put him at a disadvantage in the presidential election.\n\nThe unedited clip opens with the former VP sneezing as she explains she is ‘allergic to mold,’ while other sections of her answers were cropped and cut out completely. \n\nIn other places, Kamala Harris gave rambled answers on why she should be president, foreign policy, and Donald Trump – all which were quietly nipped by CBS. \n\nThe full version of the interview shows that while Harris gave a lengthy answer when asked about Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, CBS only aired about seven seconds on 60 Minutes.\n\nHere are the damning differences between the scripts and what made it on air. \n\nHarris slamming Trump as a ‘racist’ is edited out\n\nThe long version of the CBS interview revealed that the network cut out an entire answer Kamala Harris dedicated to slamming Donald Trump as a racist. \n\nInterviewer Bill Whitaker asked the then-Vice President: ‘And talking about that person you’re mentioning right now, you have accused Donald Trump of using racist tropes when it comes to Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, when it comes to birtherism, when it comes to Charlottesville. \n\n‘In fact, you have called him a racist, and divisive. Yet Donald Trump has the support of millions and millions of Americans. How do you explain that?’\n\nKamala Harris’ answer to this question was completely cut from the CBS episode.\n\nIn the uncut version, Harris bashed Trump for having a ‘bouquet of microphones’ at his disposal, and for his ‘most vile lies’ about people in Springfield, Ohio.\n\nThe reference is to the comments Trump made last year, about illegal migrants in the midwestern state eating people’s dogs.\n\nIn the unearthed version, Kamala also made a bizarre boast how when she was DA in California, ‘the words I spoke could move markets.’\n\nIn the deleted version of the interview, Harris then went on a strange rant about school kids’ picture day that they seemingly missed as a result of Trump’s words about Springfield, Ohio. \n\nShe responded: ‘So let’s just break down what you just talked about, and talk about it in the context of the words that Donald Trump has spoken, and the actions he has taken, and whether that is reflective of who we are as Americans, knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us. \n\n‘We have a former President who wants to be President again, who has a bouquet of microphones in front of him, who has said the most vile lies about a group of legal immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. And if I may, Bill, let me just say something. \n\n‘You know, from the time I was a prosecutor, to attorney general, to now I’m Vice President, I learned very early in my career when the voters bestow on you the authority to have these positions, you must be very thoughtful about how you use that microphone in front of you. \n\n‘And you know, when I was attorney general, the words I spoke could move markets. \n\n‘So the idea that the former president, who again is running to be President, would use that microphone in a way that is about vilifying and demeaning a whole population of people, you know what has happened because of that? \n\n‘One day when this happened was a school day, picture day for an elementary school. Picture day. You know what picture day is for our children. They get excited the night before when you put out the clothes they’re going to wear, they go to school making sure their faces are clean, and their hair is done, and they go to school for picture day. You know what happened to these children? They had to evacuate that day because of the fear of the threats that were being issued in Springfield because of the words of Donald Trump.’ \n\nInstead of airing this section, the cut version on CBS was far less explosive against the Republican – and contained far fewer words.\n\nIn the aired version, Kamala Harris was broadcasted as saying: ‘So I say that I’m glad you’re pointing these comments out that he has made, that have resulted in a response by most reasonable people to say it’s just wrong. It’s just wrong.’ \n\nHarris’ answers on Iranian threat are edited out\n\nWhitaker asked Harris a pointed, simple question about foreign policy – that was completely left out of the version CBS aired in October. \n\nHe asked the former VP: ‘Let’s hit on some more foreign policy. Which foreign country do you consider to be our greatest adversary?’\n\nKamala Harris’ answer was Iran – followed by a series of rambling sentences. \n\nShe said: ‘Well, there are different reasons that we should be thoughtful about each. Most recently, I think there’s an obvious one in mind, which is Iran. And look, I mean, Iran has American blood on their hands, okay? \n\n‘And what we saw in terms of just this attack on Israel, 200 ballistic 11 missiles, what we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power, that is one of my highest priorities. And that must be.’ \n\nThe interviewer pushed her further, asking a question about what she would do if she – as hypothetical President – found out the Middle Eastern power was building a nuclear arsenal. \n\nHe asked: ‘So if you have proof that Iran is building a nuclear weapon, would you take military action?’\n\nBut instead of taking the bait, Harris turned down the question completely. \n\nShe responded: ‘I’m not going to talk about hypotheticals at this moment.’\n\nThis entire conversation was edited out of the broadcast by CBS. \n\nHarris’ answer on why she should be president is trimmed\n\nWhitaker asked Harris why a quarter of voters feel they don’t know her – despite having served as the vice president for four years.\n\nThe newly-released transcript showed that CBS omitted a large chunk of Harris’ bizarre, digressive words about ‘traveling the country’ – rather than actually saying why she ought to be Commander-in-Chief. \n\n‘But Madam Vice 21 President, a quarter of registered voters still say they don’t know you, they don’t know what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? I mean, you have been vice president for almost four years. You’ve been on the national scene for longer. What’s the disconnect?’ Whitaker asked. \n\nIn both the edited and aired versions, Harris started her response with: ‘It’s an election, Bill. And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone’s vote.’\n\nHowever, CBS edited out her next few sentences. ‘And that’s why I’m traveling our country. I’ve seen you in a few states in the last couple of days. I’m talking with folks where they live. I’m listening to folks. And working to earn the vote of every American,’ Harris said.\n\nBoth versions continued: ‘This is an election for president of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support. You have to earn it. And that’s what I intend to do.’\n\nHarris’ answer on NATO and the war in Ukraine is trimmed\n\nWhen asked if she would expand NATO to include Ukraine if she were President, CBS cropped down Harris’ response and jumped to her slamming Trump. \n\n‘How about as President, would you support the effort to expand NATO to include Ukraine?’ Whitaker asked.\n\n‘Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against Russia’s unprovoked aggression,’ Harris said.\n\nThe transcript showed Harris actually said: ‘And doing what we can to continue to build and strengthen the alliance around the support for Ukraine’s right to be an independent nation, free from having its borders forcefully taken by Russia. \n\n‘And we are going to continue to work closely with our NATO allies to continue to reinforce America’s alliance in the context of NATO. Again, in this election, there’s a real difference between me and the former president. \n\n‘I believe in reinforcing the strength of NATO, understanding again it is the greatest military alliance the world has ever known. Donald Trump would pull us out of NATO.’\n\nHowever, CBS removed her speaking about what the Biden administration was doing to support Ukraine – before just showing her blasting Trump. \n\nThe version that aired on 60 Minutes jumped to Harris stating: ‘Donald Trump, if he were President, Putin would be sitting in Kiev right now. Let’s be clear about that. He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It’s about surrender.’ \n\nHarris’ answers on China and Taiwan are edited out\n\nAsking the then-VP a question about China, Whitaker said: ‘What about China? China is strongly asserting its dominance, its control of the South China Sea, especially around the Philippines. What is the U.S. responsibility for keeping China from simply taking over the South China Sea?’ \n\nHarris’ answer, which was completely cut from the broadcast, read: ‘Well, I have actually worked very closely with the leaders in the Philippines on just this very issue, and including the work that we are doing in terms of coordination between our military and training, and what needs to happen in terms of protecting the freedom of the South China Sea.’\n\nThe next section was also cut, apart from a voice over of Harris saying: ‘We must win the competition for the 21st century with China.’ \n\nThe full, unaired quote, read: ‘China, first of all, we must win the competition for the 21st century with China. We must be able to compete and win. We should not seek conflict, but we have to understand that there are parameters in which we must operate that include ensuring, for example, that we protect American business interests. What we -‘\n\nWhitaker said: ‘So say if China attacks Taiwan. Would we use military force to support Taiwan?’\n\nHarris refused to give a straight answer – and instead gave a flurried answer about fentanyl.\n\nShe said: ‘Bill, I’m not going to get into hypotheticals. But listen, we need to make sure that we maintain a one-China policy, and – but that includes supporting Taiwan’s ability to defend itself, including what we need to do to ensure the freedom of the Taiwan Strait. \n\n‘But on the issue of China, we also – again, these are not – We cannot afford to have foreign policy that is myopic. We must be able to also, as it relates to China, continue to do the work that we have begun to deal with the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States. That’s a real issue. Again, you talk to families around our country who have — I just, on a constant, sadly, regular basis meet parents and family members of people who have died from fentanyl, young people who have died from fentanyl. \n\n‘Are we going to stop trying to stem the flow from fentanyl? And we have to deal with that, and understand China’s role in that, and our ability to work with China to stop that flow. Which we have begun to do, and I’m going to continue to do. We need to make sure we have open lines of communication with China, in particular military to military. So these issues are all – they’re multifaceted.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAll of the damning moments that CBS edited out of their interview&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Critical moments omitted by CBS from Kamala Harris&#8217; controversial 60 Minutes interview first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/critical-moments-omitted-by-cbs-from-kamala-harris-controversial-60-minutes-interview/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/05/22/94906937-14365391-image-a-1_1738792868431.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-05 22:44:19","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":287509020,"title":"California Attorney General Rob Bonta will run for reelection, not for governor, in 2026","text":"California Attorney General Rob Bonta has put an end to years of speculation that he would run for California governor in 2026.\n\nThe Bay Area Democrat told supporters in an email Wednesday that he will run for reelection to attorney general in two years — instead of trying to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose term expires in January 2027. Dan Newman, a political consultant who is advising Bonta’s reelection bid, confirmed the announcement to the Bay Area News Group. It first was reported by Politico.\n\n“While I appreciate all the people and organizations who have urged me to run for governor, I am staying in the fight and plan on serving as attorney general for the next 6 years,” Bonta wrote in the email. “This work is simply too important and there are too many important fights ahead.”\n\nThose fights? Legal battles with President Donald Trump’s new administration, which are already ongoing, and others, he wrote.\n\nBonta never officially entered the race for governor. But he said two years ago that he was “seriously considering” a gubernatorial campaign. Former California governors Jerry Brown and George Deukmejian had both served previously as attorney general.\n\nBonta is bowing out of a crowded field in the wide-open race to replace Newsom. With 21 months until Election Day in 2026, the race is already filled with prominent Democrats who hold, or held, statewide offices.\n\nLieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis and state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond have both declared their candidacies, as have former California Senate President Toni Atkins, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former state Controller Betty Yee.\n\nFormer Democratic Rep. Katie Porter is laying the groundwork for a gubernatorial campaign but hasn’t officially announced her plans. An early poll by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies in November suggested that Porter was the initial front-runner. \n\nPossible Republican candidates include Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, political commentator Steve Hilton and Caitlyn Jenner, a well-known transgender actress and former athlete.\n\nMeanwhile, speculation is swirling that former Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris may jump into the race — a decision that would instantly freeze the crowded Democratic field and make her the front-runner, political insiders say. In an interview with Politico, Bonta said he would support Harris if she ran. Though she has dodged questions about her political future, Harris posed for photo ops with firefighters in her adopted hometown of Los Angeles after the devastating firestorm last month and then appeared at the FireAid benefit concert.\n\nBonta has a much better chance of winning another four-year term as attorney general than securing the governor’s office, said David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University.\n\nAnd as attorney general, Bonta has been thrust into a high-profile post leading Democrats’ efforts to monkey-wrench policies by the Trump administration, McCuan said.\n\n“It makes a great deal of sense for him to just hit pause,” McCuan said.\n\nIn his email, Bonta blasted Trump’s plans to “shut down everything from Medicaid to Meals on Wheels to birthright citizenship.” Bonta has already joined at least two multi-state legal challenges to stall Trump’s actions revoking birthright citizenship and potentially freezing trillions in federal spending.\n\n“To be clear, serving as attorney general of California is, without question, one of the most impactful jobs in the country right now,” Bonta wrote in the email to supporters.\n\nEarly this week, the state Legislature approved an additional $25 million for Bonta’s state Department of Justice to pay for more lawsuits against the federal government. During Trump’s first term, California sued his administration 123 times and helped recover billions of dollars in federal assistance nationally. Newsom is expected to sign the legislation.\n\nAlongside the prestige of helping lead the Democratic resistance, Bonta has been dogged by recent campaign finance and corruption probes.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported last week that had Bonta accepted $16,000 in campaign contributions from a casino that was being investigated by his own office in 2021.\n\nBonta’s name has also surfaced in documents related to the recent indictments of former Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao and her associates, who were indicted by federal authorities last month.\n\nHe’s been linked to Oakland businessmen David and Andy Duong and received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from them over the years. In January, federal authorities indicted the father-son duo on bribery, wire fraud and other charges as part of an alleged conspiracy to support Thao in exchange for kickbacks.\n\nWhile under suspicion by ethics investigators, Andy Duong posted pictures of himself and Bonta, whom he called his “brother.” Their relationship was such that Andy Duong once recommended his father give money to Bonta, stressing that he was someone who would “deliver whatever we ask for.”\n\nIn July, Bonta said he would give more than $150,000 in campaign contributions he received from the Duongs to charities, “out of an abundance of caution.” He did so shortly after Federal Bureau of Investigation agents raided the business-duo’s homes.\n\nMcCuan said Bonta’s proximity to the corruption scandal is a political liability that opponents will probably seize upon when he runs for reelection in 2026.\n\nThe political attack ad against him will “write itself,” McCuan said.","summary":"Rob Bonta, the state's Democratic Attorney General, was expected to vie to succeed Gov.

Smith Could Be The Exact Type Of Useful Idiot Democrats Need In 2028","text":"Rumors of Stephen A. Smith running for president in 2028 are a joke. Or at least they should be. Last week, the Democratic polling firm McLaughlin & Associates found that at least 2 percent of primary voters say they'd vote for Smith in 2028. Other potential candidates voters favored included Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Gavin Newsom, Josh Shapiro, and Tampon Tim Walz. Tuesday night on Fox News' \"Hannity,\" Smith said he thinks \"somebody like me could actually win\" in 2028. Smith then shared an X post claiming he was \"gaining attention as a possible Democratic candidate for the 2028 presidential election,\" adding the comment \"Not Centel\" (as in the parody account NBA Centel). Stephen A. couldn't actually be the Democrat nominee, could he? It's unlikely, but Washington politics has increasingly become a clown show, paving the way for someone like Smith to actually have a chance. To be clear, Washington needs more outsiders. Donald Trump was an outsider. Establishment Washington is broken. Nearly everyone in it is compromised and now acts at the direct behest of their donors and special interest groups (and probably blackmailers). But Stephen A. is not Donald Trump. He wasn't a successful businessman who understood the government and upheld a populist ideology. Smith is a sports commentator best known for his patented responses to statements about the NBA. Smith is an intellectual lightweight. He seems to not understand the political concepts he discusses on-air. Case in point: he recently told Will Cain that equity is his favorite term of \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" (DEI), then essentially confirmed he had no idea what equity entailed. People who know Smith inside ESPN best describe him as \"independent politically\" but afraid to offend the black community. He probably leans conservative but knows that his conservative values run afoul of the majority black demographic that watches his daily ESPN television show \"First Take.\" Hence, the frequent contradictions. Last summer, Smith acknowledged to Sean Hannity a new study that found black males increasingly relating to Donald Trump, which Smith said he understood. Then Black Twitter came for him, and he quickly caved and apologized. \"I’m fully aware that I have been in the news the last few days, paraded all over social media as well after comments I made on Fox News’ Hannity last week…A lot of folks in black America seem pretty pissed at me right now. \"Quite a few folks were offended as my words were interpreted as associating support for Trump by the black community with all the legal issues he’s facing. For that, I sincerely apologize. I’m stating right here for the record that I was taken out of context. Just because my intent was harmless, doesn’t mean my words were harmless, and I know that.\" Smith claims he was taken out of context by accurately citing the results of a poll. Huh? His lack of political chops did him in this week during another debate about DEI with Hannity. When pressed, Smith turned the debate personal by calling Pete Hegseth \"unqualified\" to be United States Secretary of Defense because he was a \"weekend host on Fox News.\" Hegseth is also a decorated military veteran who cares deeply about strengthening our armed forces. (By the way, Hegseth's weekend show drew five times as many viewers as Smith's show.) Undeniably, Hegseth is more qualified to run the military than Smith is to run the country. What qualifications does Smith even have? We ask because his background remains a mystery. As Jason Whitlock exposed, Smith published a memoir in 2023 in which he made up a fake background about himself. \"The book is filled with tall tales intended to package Smith as a heroic figure who overcame the mean streets of New York to rise as a voice who speaks truth to power,\" Whitlock uncovered. \"Early in his journalistic career, Smith spoke fondly of his father in interviews. In his book, however, he shreds his father and champions his mother as the guiding light of his life. It’s a hat-tip to the matriarchy. Smith’s parents never divorced, but Smith paints the picture that he was basically raised by a single black mother.\" Smith has yet to address any of Whitlock's findings. They are quite damning. Now, the prediction here is that Smith will continue to amplify the 2028 rumors to leverage a new contract with Disney. ESPN is currently negotiating a five-year, $100 million deal to stay at ESPN. Sources tell OutKick the deal is \"close, but not signed.\" Still, Stephen A. could be the exact type of useful idiot that Establishment Washington and its donors could use to take back control. Smith has proven during his recent foray into politics that he is willing to put his face behind whatever talking points his audience at the time prefers. Thus, the inconsistencies in his commentary on ESPN (a liberal audience), his YouTube show (a younger, conservative male audience), and \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" (a moderate audience). In many ways, Smith is the antithesis of Trump. Lobbyists and allies can't control Trump. Conversely, Stephen A. wants to be controlled in exchange for fame. Granted, if Smith made it through the Democrat primary, he would have to face someone like JD Vance on the debate stage. Vance isn't Max Kellerman.","summary":"Smith said he thinks &quot;somebody like me could actually win&quot; in 2028.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/stephen-a-smith-could-exact-type-useful-idiot-democrats-need-2028","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/02/gettyimages-2185337739.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-05 22:28:09","author":"Bobby Burack","authors":["Bobby Burack"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.223},{"id":287507994,"title":"CBS News posts raw video and transcript of 60 Minutes interview requested by FCC","text":"Both the Federal Communications Commission and CBS News publicly released the transcript and raw video of last October’s 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, which is at the center of President Donald Trump’s $10 billion lawsuit against the network.\n\nThe Trump-appointed chairman of the FCC, Brendan Carr, had requested the materials after a “news distortion” complaint was filed against the network. Carr said the complaint could be a factor in his agency’s review of the merger between the network’s parent company Paramount Global and Skydance Media, prompting Paramount executives to pursue a potential settlement with Trump’s legal team. \n\n“We are posting the same transcripts and videos of our interview with Vice President Kamala Harris that we provided to the FCC,” CBS News said in a statement after releasing them. “They show – consistent with 60 Minutes' repeated assurances to the public – that the 60 Minutes broadcast was not doctored or deceitful.” \n\nThe network added: “In reporting the news, journalists regularly edit interviews – for time, space or clarity. In making these edits, 60 Minutes is always guided by the truth and what we believe will be most informative to the viewing public – all while working within the constraints of broadcast television.”\n\nAt issue in Trump’s lawsuit – which legal experts have called “frivolous and dangerous” and CBS News has claimed is “completely without merit” – is a question about Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that was asked by correspondent Bill Whitaker. A different and longer version of Harris’ answer was aired during a preview on Face the Nation than during the 60 Minutes broadcast the following day, leading Trump to allege the network had deceptively edited the interview to interfere with the presidential election.\n\n“Each excerpt reflects the substance of the vice president's answer,” CBS News said.\n\n “As the full transcript shows, we edited the interview to ensure that as much of the vice president's answers to 60 Minutes' many questions were included in our original broadcast while fairly representing those answers,” the network emphasized. “60 Minutes' hard-hitting questions of the vice president speak for themselves.”\n\nIn a statement posted to X, Carr said that “given the value of transparency & the public interest here,” the FCC was also publicly releasing the materials and “establishing a docket and seeking comment on the issues raised in the complaint,” adding that “the people will have a chance to weigh in.”\n\nThe prospect of reaching a settlement with Trump, which Paramount Chairwoman Shari Redstone has reportedly “made up her mind” to do, has left CBS News staffers increasingly alarmed as it will appear that the network is capitulating to the president – especially as other media outlets have settled legal actions with Trump following the election.\n\n“Trump’s lawsuit was a joke, but if we settle, we become the laughingstock,” a correspondent told CNN, while another CBS staffer told The Independent that “no one is happy” and employees want CBS News leaders to fight any possible settlement.\n\nMeanwhile, 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens told staffers on Monday that he will not apologize as part of any possible Trump settlement, adding that the decision is out of his hands while urging journalists to continue to produce hard-hitting reporting. \n\nOwens and CBS News chief Wendy McMahon have also made it “crystal clear” that they strongly oppose the company settling with the president.","summary":"The video and transcript s’how – consistent with 60 Minutes' repeated assurances to the public – that the 60 Minutes broadcast was not doctored or deceitful,’ CBS News said in a statement","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/cbs-transcript-kamala-harris-interview-b2693035.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/05/21/51/Screenshot-Capture-2025-02-05-15-34-43.png?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-05 22:25:00","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.108},{"id":287511372,"title":"BBC star reveals he's been BANNED from Hinge after 300 women viewed his profile and accused him of catfishing","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Feb 6th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiam Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy breaks silence on star's final days and reveals why she left Argentina before his death\n\nTrump declares war on women's sports is OVER as he unveils plan to ban trans athletes from Olympics\n\nDeath toll in Congo uprising nears 3,000 including scores of female inmates who were raped and burned alive with their children when women's jail was stormed: Corpses pile up in streets as Rwanda-backed rebels go on rampage\n\nTHIS is washing up on UK beaches and could kill your dog: Urgent warning as at least four pets die with more sickened\n\nWe've all seen those 2am texts between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni - and we all know what they REALLY mean: AMANDA PLATELL\n\nGrenfell Tower to be demolished: Bereaved families are told by Angela Rayner that 24-storey block will be ripped down nearly eight years after 72 people were killed in fire\n\nTantrum... but no tiara!

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JASON CHESTER FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:22:04 GMT, 5 February 2025 |Updated:22:16 GMT, 5 February 2025 \n\nGethin Jones might be one of the most eligible bachelors in showbiz, but his celebrity status did him no favours with the ladies after he signed up to a popular dating app. \nThe BBC presenter, whose former partners include opera singer Katherine Jenkins, opted to join Hinge - but got more than he bargained for after setting up his profile. \nInstead of the expected flurry of interest, instantly recognisable Gethin, 46, was reported for catfishing by hundreds of skeptical women who refused to believe it was really him. \nRecalling the incident during an appearance on the Restless Natives podcast, he said: 'A couple of weeks ago I was kicked off Hinge twice in eight hours for violating the Code of Conduct. Three hundred women had reported me for catfishing. \n'It was that moment when you have to write to Hinge, on a Thursday night, all alone, \"Dear Hinge, it’s Gethin here, 46, I just want to get my money back because it’s not really working for me\", eating some cereal because there’s nothing in the fridge.'\n'That’s when I’m like, \"What am I doing with my life.\"' \n\nGethin Jones might be one of the most eligible bachelors in showbiz, but his celebrity status did him no favours with the ladies after he signed up to a popular dating app\n\nGethin was involved in a four relationship with Katherine Jenkins from 2007, two years after their initial meeting.\nGethin was involved in a four relationship with Katherine Jenkins from 2007, two years after their initial meeting. \nThe couple announced their engagement in February 2011, but ten months later confirmed they had separated. \nJenkins has since married American artist and film director Andrew Levitas, with whom she raises two children. \nSpeaking to MailOnline three years after the split, Gethin admitted: ‘All I want to do now is meet someone, get married, have a big family, be a good father.\n‘I have never made any secret of that but the problem is finding someone. I started going to yoga classes as I thought that would be a good place to meet girls, but it is hard to chat to someone when you are balancing upside down.\n‘I had thought I’d be married by now - I was engaged, so obviously I thought that’s where it was heading - but I can’t force the issue. If it’s not meant to be, it won’t happen.’\nGethin's subsequent romantic interests have included former The Only Way Is Essex star Lucy Mecklenburgh, TV presenter Amanda Byram and German underwear model Katja Zwara. \nHowever Lucy later clarified she had never been in a relationship with the presenter. \n\nHe was also romantically linked with fellow TV presenter Amanda Byram (pictured together) \nShe told New! magazine: 'We're not dating. We went out a few times a while ago but it was bad timing for both of us.'\nSpeaking in 2023, Gethin insisted he had never voluntarily used an online app in his search for a girlfriend. \n'I've never done an online app, it’s such a shame', he told the Express. 'I’ve got the perfect photos for an online profile but I’ve never done it. \nI went on [celebrity dating app] Raya for a week. What a joke that was. I don’t even know how I ended up on there.\n'I think my mate put me on it during lockdown because he said I needed to get out more.' \nGethin JonesBBCKatherine Jenkins\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBBC star reveals he's been BANNED from Hinge after 300 women viewed his profile and accused him of catfishing\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nLiam Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy breaks silence on star's final days and reveals why she left Argentina before his death\n\nTantrum - no tiara!

For one, Trump posted “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT” on Truth Social in September after the 14-time Grammy winner endorsed his then-opponent Kamala Harris, and before that, the Republican politician’s campaign used artificially generated images falsely painting Swift as a MAGA supporter leading up to the 2024 election.\n\n “Fence sitting to please the media and public for a man that has directly attacked your girlfriend is lamee,” one person wrote on X shortly after the press conference, while another fan posted, “if my boyfriend says its a great honor to have the man that slanders me constantly i would break up with him immediately.”\n\n “this is disappointing,” added another Swiftie. “he has also publicly insulted your girlfriend multiple times.”\n\n Billboard has reached out to Kelce’s reps for comment.\n\n Not all responses to the Grotesquerie actor’s Trump comments have been negative, however. Some fans have come to Kelce’s defense, with one person writing on X, “he’s made it clear where he stands multiple times and one sh—y pr approved answer isn’t going to change that.”\n\n “Am I supposed to give a f— if Travis kelce said playing the biggest game in his career in front of the president of the United States was an honor?” another supporter added. “you don’t have to agree or like trump to understand what Travis was saying. Yall spin everything in a negative way.”\n\n The tight end’s remark about Trump’s attendance comes just four days ahead of Super Bowl LIX, which will take place at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, with the Chiefs aiming for a record third victory in a row as they play against the Philadelphia Eagles. After going to many of her boyfriend’s home games throughout the 2024-25 NFL season, Swift is expected to be present at the final match to cheer him on.\n\n Beyond the Trump question, one topic that has come up a lot in Kelce’s pre-Super Bowl press obligations is the Eras Tour headliner. On Monday, the athlete played coy when reporters asked him about his plans to propose to Swift, whose work ethic he praised elsewhere in that day’s junket.\n\n “I better hold up my end of the bargain, right?” he said of Swift. “She’s up there being the superstar that she is and never taking no for an answer and always working her tail off. I better match that energy for sure.”\n\n See how fans are reacting to Travis Kelce’s comment about Donald Trump’s Super Bowl attendance below.","summary":"Some Swifties are calling him out, while others are coming to the tight end's defense.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-fans-react-travis-kelce-donald-trump-super-bowl-comment-1235893446/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Travis-Kelce-conference-feb-5-2025-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-05 22:12:29","author":"Hannah Dailey","authors":["Hannah Dailey"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.106},{"id":287495354,"title":"CBS releases unedited version of Kamala Harris 60 Minutes interview that Trump says was rigged in her favor","text":"CBS releases unedited version of Kamala Harris 60 Minutes interview that Trump says was rigged in her favor\n\nWelcome to MAGAland podcast: Trump’s tariffs, Elon’s USAID takeover – and how aviation safety hangs in the balance.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib blasted President Donald Trump for his comments on the war in Gaza and urged her allies to ramp up a push for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. \"This president can only spew this fanatical bulls--- because of bipartisan support in Congress for funding genocide and ethnic cleansing,\" Tlaib said on Twitter Tuesday. \"It’s time for my two-state solution colleagues to speak.\" Tlaib's comments came after Trump proposed a U.S. takeover of war-torn Gaza following the war, saying that Palestinians could be resettled to other countries. SAUDI ARABIA CONTRADICTS TRUMP, VOWS NO TIES WITH ISRAEL WITHOUT CREATION OF PALESTINIAN STATE But Tlaib’s calls for other lawmakers to \"speak up\" comes after she declined to take a stance on last year’s presidential election. Tlaib’s decision not to endorse a candidate in the presidential race came during a time of severe backlash against the Biden administration’s policies in Gaza by many constituents in her district, with some Muslim leaders going so far as to endorse Trump despite their traditional support for Democratic candidates. One such leader, Bishara Bahbah, chaired a group known as Arab Americans for Trump. But Bahbah announced on Wednesday that he was changing the name of the group, according to a report from the Associated Press, citing Trump’s comments on Gaza. THE HISTORY OF GAZA AMID TRUMP’S PLAN TO REBUILD ENCLAVE \"The talk about what the president wants to do with Gaza, obviously we’re completely opposed to the idea of the transfer of Palestinians from anywhere in historic Palestine,\" he said in a statement announcing the group’s name would be changed to Arab Americans for Peace. \"And so we did not want to be behind the curve in terms of pushing for peace, because that has been our objective from the very beginning.\" But the sudden outcry in reaction to Trump’s comments wasn’t well received by all Democrats, with Democratic strategist Julian Epstein telling Fox News Digital that Trump’s proposal was a lot more positive than anything Tlaib appears to be offering as a solution. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Whether you agree or disagree with Trump’s proposal, at least he is proposing something that could lead to a bright future for Gaza,\" Epstein said. \"Tlaib, on the other hand, has advocated for policies that would keep the neo-Nazi, terrorist, race-hating Hamas in power while mimicking their rhetoric rom ‘river to sea,’ for which she was sanctioned by the House, including with Democratic support.\"","summary":"Rep.

Email nic.white@mailonline.com \nBy NIC WHITE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:21:58 GMT, 5 February 2025 |Updated:21:58 GMT, 5 February 2025 \n\nOpenAI whistleblower Suchir Balaji's parents have sued the City of San Francisco in their quest to prove he was murdered.\nThe tech prodigy, 26, who just a month earlier revealed the company's dubious methods of training ChatGPT, was found dead on November 26.\nBalaji was sprawled next to his bathroom door with a gunshot wound to the head and blood all over part of his apartment in San Francisco's Mint Hill neighborhood.\nHis parents Poornima Ramarao and Balaji Ramamurthy insist he couldn't have killed himself, and are furious police took just 40 minutes to rule his death a suicide.\nThey claim their efforts to prove to have been hampered by the city's refusal to release the police incident report and other case files to them.\nA lawsuit filed in the San Francisco Superior Court demands a court order granting them access to the documents.\n'In the two-plus months since their son’s passing, petitioners and their counsel have been stymied at every turn as they have sought more information about the cause of and circumstances surrounding Suchir’s tragic death,' it read.\nTheir lawyer, Kevin Rooney, argued the city was violating the California Public Records Act with its refusal.\n\nSuchir Balaji, 26, was found in his apartment in San Francisco on November 26 with a gunshot to the head and his death ruled a suicide\n\nBalaji's parents Poornima Ramarao and Balaji Ramamurthy (pictured with him) insist he was murdered and have spent more than $100,000 trying to prove it\nThe lawsuit accused authorities of trying to have it both ways by saying the case was closed, but then denying access to the files because the case was still open.\n'This contradiction is causing a delay that is unlawful and unjustified,' Rooney wrote.\nBalaji's parents hired Joseph Cohen, former chief forensic pathologist of Riverside County, California, to conduct a second autopsy in December.\nRamarao earlier told DailyMail.com she wouldn't release the results until after the Los Angeles Medical Examiner released its report, which is due by 90 days his death.\nThe lawsuit listed some of the results, but did not reveal its findings on whether Balaji took his own life, or if it determined another manner of death.\n'Dr Cohen, determined that Suchir had suffered a single gunshot wound to the mid-forehead, between his eyebrows and slightly to the right of the bridge of the nose,' the lawsuit detailed.\n'In what Dr Cohen characterized as atypical and uncommon in suicides, he noted that the trajectory of the bullet was downward with a slight left to right angle. He also noted that the bullet completely missed the brain before perforating and lodging in the brain stem. \n'Significantly, Dr Cohen also noted a contusion to the back of Suchir’s head.'\nBalaji's parents previously used the finding that the bullet missed the brain, meaning he instead bled to death, and the separate head injury, to bolster their argument that his death was a murder, not suicide.\n\nBalaji lived in this high-end building on Buchanan Street in San Francisco's Mint Hill neighborhood\nThe lawsuit explained how staff form the medical examiner's office handed Ramarao the apartment keys and told her she could retrieve his body the next day. \n'The representative also told Ms Ramarao that she should not be allowed to see Suchir’s body and that his face had been destroyed when a bullet went through his eye,' it read.\nRooney stated that Balaji's parents asked about the status of the investigation, but did not receive a formal response. \n'Informally, SFPD officials informed petitioners’ counsel that homicide detectives briefly re-opened the investigation, reviewed closed circuit recordings from Suchir’s building, and shortly thereafter closed the investigation again, concluding that Suchir had committed suicide,' the lawsuit read.\nA key reason for the suicide ruling is that no one was seen on CCTV entering an area of the building where they could have gone into Balaji's apartment.\nHowever, his parents claimed there were two entrances that were not monitored by security cameras.\nThe city is yet to file a response to the lawsuit, and declined to comment. \n\nPhotos obtained by DailyMail.com show blood was pooled next to the bathroom door where his head lay, but also splattered around the bathroom far from the body\nThe grisly scene left untouched\nPhotos obtained by DailyMail.com show blood was pooled next to the bathroom door where his head lay, but also splattered around the bathroom far from the body.\nLying on the bloodstains were one of Balaji's wireless earbuds and two mysterious tufts of what appeared to be synthetic hair, like from a wig.\nHis home, in a high-end building on Buchanan Street in San Francisco's Mint Hill neighborhood, was also ransacked, 'like someone was searching for something'.\n'After seeing there is so much blood everywhere, I don't know how they think it's a suicide, it doesn't look close,' his father, Ramamurthy, told DailyMail.com.\nBalaji's parents refuse to believe their son took his own life, insisting it was a 'cold-blooded murder' despite police declaring there was no foul play.\nHis apartment sits frozen in time - never cleaned, and touched as little as possible since police left it on November 26.\nNeither have they held a proper funeral nor buried his body, instead raising $85,000 to pay lawyers, investigators, and forensic experts to prove he was murdered.\n\nBlood both inside the bathroom, and pooled on the floor outside the door where his head was found\nOne of them was Professor Dinesh Rao, who wrote a preliminary report on the scene obtained by DailyMail.com.\nThe report includes dozens of photos showing the condition of Balaji's one-bedroom apartment, along with earlier images taken by his family.\nThe bachelor pad is relatively orderly through the entrance and lounge area, but rapidly changes as you get closer to where he died.\nHis last meal, a half-eaten ready-meal with brown rice still in the plastic tray, sits on his cluttered desk with a fork and a restaurant receipt.\nWorse still is the kitchen table, strewn with clutter, some of which spilled onto the floor along with pieces of chocolate.\n'The disturbed surroundings supports possibility of fights/resistance, which need to be corroborated with other forensic evidence,' Rao wrote.\nBalaji's bedroom was also in upheaval, and a wireless earbud was found on the floor near the entrance, with blood stains and hair strands on it.\nClose by, just outside the bathroom door near the hinges, was a large area of dried blood with the other earbud and a red shopping bag.\n\nHis last meal, a half-eaten ready-meal with brown rice still in the plastic tray, sits on his cluttered desk with a fork and a restaurant receipt\n\nHis apartment sits frozen in time - never cleaned, and touched as little as possible since police left it on November 26\n\nThe bachelor pad is relatively orderly through the entrance and lounge area, but rapidly changes as you get closer to where he died\n\nThe kitchen table, strewn with clutter, some of which spilled onto the floor along with pieces of chocolate\nSplattered blood extended up the door and the doorframe about 18 inches, dripping down to the floor, and a splash extended just past the threshold on the bathroom tiles.\nOne tuft of synthetic hair was jammed in the corner of the door, and other, including a pin, so coated with dried blood it blended into the pool.\nThe hair has only been physically examined and will soon undergo lab tests, along with blood samples, to find out what it is made of and if there was anyone else's DNA at the scene. \nInside the bathroom were drops of blood across the tiles, on the cabinet next to the sink, and on the cabinet handle, on the other side of the room.\nRao wrote that some of the drops of blood appeared to have fallen while the victim was sitting, or possibly crawling, and others while standing. Some of the blood could have been coughed up.\nAlso on the floor was a knocked over trash bin and a plastic floss pick. \nRamarao said she had not seen photos of her son's body at the scene, but police told her he was found lying on his back with his feet pointed away from the bathroom.\nShe also said the private autopsy she paid for showed the bullet was shot from above, entering above his nose and lodging just below the back of his skull. \n\nInside the bathroom were drops of blood across the tiles, on the cabinet next to the sink, and on the cabinet handle, on the other side of the room\n\nAlso on the floor was a knocked over trash bin and a plastic floss pick\n\nThe stock layout of Balaji's apartment with the bathroom where he was found on the left\nShe claimed the bullet completely missed his brain, and he instead bled to death on the bathroom door, and had a second blunt trauma wound on the side of his head.\nRao wrote in his report that Balaji likely bled for 15 to 30 minutes.\nBalaji's parents theorize their son was attacked from behind while he was listening to music and cleaning his teeth, and his head smashed into the wall or cabinet.\nAfter fighting back, he was pulled up onto his knees or sitting down, and shot in the head. As the wound wasn't fatal, he survived for some minutes and got out of the bathroom before dying from blood loss.\n'A 10-minute struggle, probably,' his father said.\nHis parents believe the apartment was ransacked because the killer was looking for a storage device that had damning evidence on it.\nBalaji's gun, a Glock pistol that records showed he bought on January 4, 2024, was found near his body, along with a box of 9mm ammunition in his closet with six rounds missing.\nOne of the rounds was found in the gun case, which included the record of sale, another four elsewhere, and one unaccounted for.\nBallistic tests to confirm whether this was the gun that killed him are yet to be carried out. His parents claimed there was no gunshot residue on his hands.\n\nSplattered blood extended up the door and the doorframe about 18 inches, dripping down to the floor, and a splash extended just past the threshold on the bathroom tiles\n\nBlood drops inside the bathroom looking inside from the door\n\nA splash of lighter blood next to a red shopping bag that was stuck to the biggest blood pool\nRao criticized the police investigation as 'incomplete and inadequate' that missed vital clues like the fake hair and earbuds, which he called 'a very serious error'.\n'Will have a serious impact on the understanding of the manner of death, besides helping the alleged suspect (if any) to escape from the crime and adding more speculations surrounding the death,' he wrote.\nRao wrote that the disturbed scenes were 'more likely seen in homicidal death scene and rarely observed in alleged suicidal cases'.\nHe also noted the lack of a suicide note and the 'widely distributed and pattern of blood splatters' were 'most unlikely in victims whose fatality/unconsciousness is instantaneous' as in a suicide by gunshot.\nRamamurthy said his son's apartment was never completely tidy, but it was never anywhere near as messy as they found it.\n'Everything is scattered, like somebody is searching something,' he said.\n'And the blood spots all over the place, hairs… if they have taken a deep analysis, they could have seen this, but they didn't want to, they just took the gun and took him, that's all.\n'They already decided it was a suicide when they walked in, in 40 minutes, then they handed us back the keys.'\n\nBlood on the other side of the doorframe to the vast majority of the blood splatter, as seen from inside the bathroom\n\nBalaji's gun, a Glock pistol that records show he bought on January 4, 2024, was found near his body, along with a box of 9mm ammunition in his closet with six rounds missing\n\nOne of the rounds was found in the gun case, which included the record of sale, another four elsewhere, and one unaccounted for\nBalaji's last hours alive \nRamamurthy was the last known person to speak to Balaji, in a phone call at 7.12pm on November 22 that may only have been hours before he died.\nBalaji had just returned from a holiday to Catalina Island, off the coast of Los Angeles, with some friends, who were former colleagues or worked in tech, for his birthday a day earlier.\nThey spoke for 15 minutes about his trip, the hikes he did in LA, the weather, and the birthday money Balaji would soon be sent.\nRamamurthy asked him if he wanted to go to an exhibit in January together, and he said, 'Sure, let's see, I'll think about it'.\n'I asked do you plan to visit us and he said, \"Not immediately\",' he recalled.\n'He was happy, he didn't show any depression. He had just returned, and in the end he said, 'I'm going for dinner, I'll talk to you later.' Usually, he goes out for dinner.'\nWhether the half-eaten ready-meal meant he never went out, just got takeaway, or ate it the next day is unclear as the exact time of death is not known - though police believe it to be that night or the next morning.\nBalaji's parents didn't hear from him for the next two days - the weekend - but weren't concerned as he was often busy and had just returned home.\nBut by Monday, they began to worry; it wasn't like him not to answer their calls at all.\n'We called all the hospitals because sometimes he rides his bike and in San Francisco sometimes there are crazy drivers, so we thought something happened, an accident or something,' Ramamurthy said.\n'He wasn't there so we thought he must have gone to a friend's place or hiking.'\n\nBalaji had just returned from a holiday to Los Angeles with some friends, who were former colleagues or worked in tech, for his birthday a day earlier\n\nBalaji hiking near Los Angeles during the holiday just before he died\nThey reported him missing first thing on Tuesday, and police forced open his door about 1pm for a welfare check. That's when they found his body.\nRamarao arrived soon after, and claimed police refused for hours to tell her if her son was dead. At 2pm they told her to go home, but she refused.\nFinally, at 3.20pm, she saw a white van arrive outside and only a stretcher emerge. Staff inside were from the medical examiner, and told her a body was in Balaji's apartment.\nRamamurthy said the couple wrestled for days with the being told their son took his own life, until a phone call from the Associated Press changed everything.\nTech prodigy to whistleblower\nBalaji never expected to become a lightning rod for those wary of the emerging power of artificial intelligence - or just his boss, OpenAI founder Sam Altman.\nHe joined the company in November 2020, having spent four months interning there two years earlier while studying at UC Berkley.\nRamarao was always convinced her son was special, from speaking complex sentences at two to building a computer at 13 as he grew up in Cupertino, California.\n'He was a prodigy. We knew he had excellent motor skills when he was two and a half months,' she said at a vigil the day after his body was found.\n'At 13 months old, he showed he was not ordinary by picking up all the alphabet. Less than two years old, he could recognize words.'\nHis senior year of high school in 2016 he won a platinum division of the USA Computing Olympiad, a programming competition, and was recruited to work for Quora as a software engineer.\nThen in 2018, while a student at Berkley, he won $100,000 by placing seventh in a competition to write an algorithm to improve TSA passenger screening.\nBalaji's work at OpenAI also impressed, to the extent where co-founder John Schulman lionized him on LinkedIn.\n'He'd think through the details of things carefully and rigorously. And he also had a slight contrarian streak that made him allergic to \"groupthink\" and eager to find where the consensus was wrong,' he wrote. \n\nBalaji never expected to become a lightning rod for those wary of the emerging power of artificial intelligence\nBut as early as 2022 he was starting to question the work he was doing, training GPT-4 - the engine behind ChatGPT - with reams of data from the internet.\nBalaji had justified his work by treating it like a research project, but after it was launched in late 2022 and sold commercially, he began to rethink this.\nHe came to the conclusion that OpenAI was so grossly violating copyright laws that not only was it illegal, it was unsustainable for the internet itself.\nEventually he quit last August and wrote his findings in a detailed essay on his personal website, then spoke to the New York Times.\nBalaji's NYT interview was published on October 23, shocking his parents and even his friends - none of whom he told in advance.\nRamarao berated him for speaking out by himself instead of joining forces with other whistleblowers, and for posing for photos so everyone knew what he looked like.\n'I was very concerned because he might be called a whistleblower that might impact his career, that was my biggest fear,' she said.\n'But never that his life would be in danger.'\nBalaji told her not to worry – he wasn't giving away confidential secrets, just expressing his opinion on the work, and he had enough money from his OpenAI stock.\n'He said he wasn't looking for another job, he said he was planning to found a startup,' his mother said.\n\nBalaji worked for OpenAI founder Sam Altman until last August, when he quit and and wrote his findings in a detailed essay on his personal website, then spoke to the New York Times\nThen a week before his death, the NYT named him as a 'custodian witness' in its copyright infringement lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft.\nHis mother believes that implied he had more damaging information up his sleeve, and was targeted for it.\nBalaji wasn't done going public, either. Days after his death, his phone rang and his parents picked it up.\nOn the other end was an Associated Press reporter who didn't know Balaji was dead, and was calling to schedule an interview he agreed to do.\n'Maybe he had some new information to share with AP and somebody doesn't want that liability, so they targeted him,' Ramamurthy said.\n'After that phone call we got suspicious. We were just finding so many things suddenly happened and it was kind of frozen for us what to do next.\n'So then we got this call, then we thought, oh, this is something totally big, this has to be investigated.'\nWorried, but not suicidal\nBalaji's parents have three main reasons they believe he couldn't have killed himself - the crime scene, the timing of his death after going public, and that he had too much to life for.\n'There's no depression, he didn't have a suicide note or anything, he was financially stable, he has a good friends circle, going around having a good time,' his father said.\n'If I'm depressed usually I'm isolated watching movies and drinking – but he didn't do that.'\n'The way I talked to him that night, he didn't show any stress, he was very cool and normal and there was no strain in his voice.\n'He takes care of himself, he goes to the gym, he's health-conscious, he goes with friends to so many movies – he's not a person to get depressed, he's outgoing, he had plans for his own startup.\n'He had some members already collected from Berkley, he had a lot of future plans.'\n\n Ramarao berated him for speaking out by himself instead of joining forces with other whistleblowers, and for posing for photos so everyone knew what he looked like\n\nBalaji (center) with friends. His parents said he had a very active social life\nThough his parents are adamant Balaji wasn't depressed or suicidal, he wasn't quite himself - he seemed worried, off-balance, even afraid.\nRamamurthy said he thought Balaji was planning to do more press interviews as a means of protecting himself 'and also expose things'.\nHe also speculated whoever killed Balaji gave him a warning and that's why he bought a gun 10 months before his death. \n'He didn't care – he's a little bit more like his mother than me, I'm very cautious,' he said.\n'He bought a gun in January, that's a long time back, one year, so we assume he has had some threat somewhere, you want to protect himself from that.'\nRamarao said he also months earlier discussed with his former boss about leaving OpenAI and studying a PhD instead.\n'Usually he'll be very focused on his work, so there was something going on… [we may never know] unless we get access to his laptop and other things or the HR record or something, since he's very secretive,' she said.\nBalaji 'hated' his boss\nAnother wrinkle was added to the story when Sam Altman's sister Ann Altman, 30, claimed he molested her when she was a child.\nThe disturbing lawsuit filed earlier this month in the US District Court of Missouri - where the siblings grew up - alleged the abuse was between 1997 - when Ann was just three years old and Sam was 12 - and 2006. \nIt claimed Altman 'groomed and manipulated [her] into believing the aforementioned sexual acts were her idea, despite the fact she was under the age of five years old when the sexual abuse began and [he] was nearly a teenager'.\nAltman and his family took the unusual step of publicly rebutting the 'deeply hurtful and entirely untrue claims'.\nThey said Annie 'faces mental health challenges' and despite financial assistance and offers of help, kept asking for money and making damaging claims about her family.\n\nSam Altman (pictured left) denied claims by his sister Ann (pictured center-left) in a new lawsuit that he sexually abused her as a child\nRamarao said she had no opinion on the lawsuit, calling it 'between the two of them'.\n'There are things that we know that we can speak for there are things that we don't know that we cannot speak for, right?' she said.\nBut she said though Balaji never spoke to his parents about Altman, friends have since his death revealed the contempt he held his boss in.\n'He's a very weird person… Suchir hated him, that much I can tell you. All his friends say he was very vocal against Sam Altman,' she said.\n'He never hated anyone in his life in his life. I've never heard him complain in the school days or college days or even coworkers. He never said anything negative about anyone, so he probably had strong reasons for that.'\nParents search for the truth \nRamamurthy said the funeral home his son's body was sent to was among the first to suggest they get a second autopsy, because Balaji's death seemed 'suspicious'.\n'These events made us think this is not a suicide, it is a planned cold-blooded murder,' he said.\n'It was executed over the weekend so people won't find him for a long time and also he was on vacation so they can get in and do the required things to set up.'\nThe autopsy was done in early December at the cost of thousands of dollars, and Ramarao insisted it called the suicide explanation into question.\nHowever, she said they wouldn't release it until after the medical examiner's office released theirs.\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner must complete its autopsy report within 90 days of the examination, which is in just over a month.\n\nBalaji's parents have three main reasons they believe he couldn't have killed himself - the crime scene, the timing of his death after going public, and that he had too much to life for\n\nA second autopsy was done in early December at the cost of thousands of dollars, and Ramarao insisted it called the suicide explanation into question\nRamarao is on the phone or in meetings all day, talking to investigators, lawyers, and supporters to bring attention to her cause.\n'We have depleted all of our saving in the fight for justice,' she wrote on a fundraiser, citing legal fees of $1,000 to $1,500 an hour and $500 to $800 an hour for private investigators.\nRamarao in other interviews has heavily implied, and at least once outright named, who she thinks had her son killed - but now takes a more guarded line.\n'We don't know who it is, unless we do the investigation we won't know,' she said.\n'If we ask, generally, who would have benefited from this, we know. We can pinpoint and say, \"yeah, this person could be benefited\" - but unless proven, not guilty.'\nBut both she and Ramamurthy feel the stress of speaking out, as their son did, and worry they could be next. They no longer go out anywhere alone.\n'That's what people are telling us, you're already being watched and your life may be at risk, be cautious,' Ramarao said.\n'We know our enemy is very, very powerful.'\nNo matter how painful it was to lose him, Ramarao said she remained proud of her son for his courage in sticking to his principles.\n'I am not grieving, I have become numb… I don't know how I could have saved my son by teaching him to tell lies,' she said at his vigil.\n'The ethics with which I raised him took his life today.'\n\nNo matter how painful it was to lose him, Ramarao said she remained proud of her son for his courage in sticking to his principles\nBalaji's death takes on a life of its own\nConspiracy theories about Balaji's death started almost immediately after it became public in news reports on December 13.\nSocial media provocateurs and true crime buffs quickly began sharing and debating the story, declaring that the AI industry had him killed.\nHis family first posted online about it on December 14, writing 'we are seeking to know complete truth, we need more answers', adding fuel to the fire.\nAn alliance of crypto fans, right-wing pundits, influencers, fringe 'journalists', and outright conspiracy theorists has kept the chatter raging for six weeks. \nThe online avalanche reached sufficient intensity that it reached the attention of Altman's arch-nemesis Elon Musk.\n'This doesn't seem like a suicide,' he wrote when reposting one of Ramarao's tweets, and also shared other articles and posts about the case with comments like 'hmm' and 'concerning'.\nMusk has a longstanding feud with OpenAI and Altman and battled them since they refused his offer to buy them out in 2018. \nHe has since slammed OpenAI for accepting $90 billion of funding, and its plans to transition to a for-profit company, arguing the commercial enterprise flies in the face of its original mission - to help fight threats to humanity posed by AI. \nIt was inevitable Musk would get involved in Balaji's case, not only due to his animosity towards Altman and OpenAI, but because many of those sharing it had one thing in common.\nEven before he got involved, many of the extremely online proponents were avowed fans of the Tesla billionaire and shared his distrust of Altman.\n\n'This doesn't seem like a suicide,' Elon Musk, arch-nemesis of Sam Altman, wrote when reposting one of Ramarao's tweets, and also shared other articles and posts about the case\nSome saw the tragedy as an opportunity to enrich themselves, either by sharing it to increase their clout, making shareable video content, or in one case making millions off a memecoin shamelessly exploiting Balaji's death.\nOthers have more genuine motives, like Fremont, California, real estate agent Girish Bangalore, who started a petition demanding a 'comprehensive investigation'.\nThe San Francisco Police Department said Balaji's death was still an 'active and open investigation' and declined to share the full incident report.\nOpenAI said it was 'devastated' after his death was made public and was in touch with his family to offer support\n'Our priority is to continue to do everything we can to assist them,' it said.\n'We first became aware of his concerns when The New York Times published his comments and we have no record of any further interaction with him.\n'We respect his, and others', right to share views freely. Our hearts go out to Suchir's loved ones, and we extend our deepest condolences to all who are mourning his loss.\n'Suchir was a valued member of our team and we are still heartbroken by his passing. We continue to feel his loss deeply.\n'We've reached out to the San Francisco Police Department and have offered our assistance if it's needed. \n'Law enforcement are the right authorities in this situation, and we trust them to continue sharing updates as needed. \n'Out of respect, we won't be commenting further.'\nOpenAICalifornia\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBig tech whistleblower Suchir Balaji's parents sue San Francisco after police claimed he 'shot himself dead'\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nLiam Payne's girlfriend breaks silence on star's final days and reveals why she left Argentina before his death - while saying 'I'm not to blame'\n\nTantrum - no tiara!

The Hyde Amendment, which limits federal spending for abortion to cases of rape, incest, or when a mother's life is in danger, first passed the U.S. House by 312 to 93 in 1976. That's ancient history today, when not even ending infanticide can get sufficient numbers in both chambers to send a bill for signature to President Donald Trump. This fact should send shock waves through anyone who cares whether the Democratic Party survives.When the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act faced members of the U.S. House and Senate last month as the anniversary of Roe v. Wade came and went, only one Democrat—Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas—had the courage to say that a baby born during a botched abortion deserved the same level of medical care that a child born in any other setting would receive.Voters agree. Less than 1 in 10 registered Millennial and Gen Z voters (almost half of the electorate) support the current position of the Democratic Party—abortion without limits up to and including infanticide if born during a botched abortion. This statistic comes from a January 2025 Students for Life & Demetree Institute for Pro-Life Advancement YouGov/SurveyUSA poll that examined policy expected to come up during the Trump administration.Almost 9 in 10 young voters believe that a baby born during a botched abortion should receive help, and nearly seven in 10 (66 percent) wanted 911 to be called when an aborted child is born alive.Yet the Democratic Party caucus stood almost completely united in supporting even infanticide, as that's what the abortion lobby wanted.In 2023, then-vice president Kamala Harris said ending infanticide was \"extreme\" and that doing so would \"jeopardize the right to reproductive health care in our country.\" Her sentiments were echoed by those few who likely voted for her, but they were not enough to win her the White House.Prior to the inauguration, at the People's March, one marcher said that if a baby survives an abortion, infanticide was the right call. The marcher said, \"If the person that had the baby doesn't want the baby, they're there to end it, whatever that means.\"What that means is that the abortion industry, and its multi-million-dollar political donations, have built a loyal cohort in the party my family once fiercely supported.In 2024 alone, millions of dollars flowed from the abortion lobby to the Democratic Party, and that money bought something: loyalty. But political loyalty from those seeking office didn't turn into voter loyalty. My family isn't the only one that left a party that once stood for the most vulnerable.A problem with embracing the death-for-profit enterprise, fueled by national and international abortion vendors lined up for a payday, is the cognitive dissonance that comes when asserting rights for the unborn other than the right to life. Just consider this recent New York Times headline: \"Undocumented Women Ask: Will My Unborn Child Be a Citizen?\"The cognitive dissonance around abortion doesn't stop there. Three Democratic presidents manipulated the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to force chemical abortion pills onto the market, and then began deregulating them. In fact, in 2021, on the same day the FDA pulled Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine because six people had suffered blood clots and one person died, the FDA announced that health and safety standards for chemical abortion pills had been dropped.In the name of preserving abortion access during COVID, the Biden-Harris administration dropped health and safety standards despite the fact that no-test online distribution of chemical abortion pills exposes women to risks of injury, infertility, and even death; empowers sex abusers with easy access to the drugs; and even creates environmental hazards.Students for Life Action, my organization, is calling on the Trump administration to protect water sources from abortion pollution, which is now going unchecked as most chemically tainted blood, placental tissue, and human remains from abortion are flushed away. It's an issue we intend to raise with the FDA, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Health and Human Services.Will the party that prides itself on being a champion of the environment, women's health, and vulnerable groups protect clean water, safety standards for women's health, and our country's most vulnerable—or abortion?The tough votes are going to keep coming, and the Democratic Party must choose between abortion as its only offering to Americans or an agenda that protects those who want to live in this country we all call home.Kristan Hawkins is president of Students for Life of America and Students for Life Action, with more than 1,500 groups on middle and high school, college and university, medical and law school campuses in all 50 states.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy TASH MOSHEIM SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:20:58 GMT, 5 February 2025 |Updated:21:27 GMT, 5 February 2025 \n\nDavina McCall has revealed she named her brain tumour, and even threw it a party.\nA rare colloid cyst in her brain, though benign, carried the risk of sudden death before the TV presenter underwent life-saving surgery in November 2024.\nThe former Big Brother presenter, 57, shared on her podcast Begin Again: ‘I called my brain tumour Jeffrey.\n‘I needed to name it something. And I didn’t have any personal friends that were called Jeffrey, so it seemed like a good name to call him. And we had a Jeffrey happy birthday party with friends.’\nShe said her boyfriend, hairdresser Michael Douglas, 49, ‘played the piano and sang some songs and sort of did speeches. And we all kind of talked about things and I talked about the fact that I was a bit scared, but “I know I’m going to do it\".\n‘And if it was going to happen to anybody, it was good it happened to me because I am robust mentally and I can handle it.’\n\nDavina McCall has revealed she named her brain tumour, and even threw it a party\n\nThe My Mum Your Dad presenter had her tumour picked up at a private clinic when she was offered a health check after taking part in a talk about menopause \nThe mother-of-three was so fearful of dying that she ensured her affairs were in order.\n‘I wrote letters of wishes to all the children, and put those in my will.’\n‘What I wanted to do was to try and find a way that they would all find a way through if I didn’t make it. They make me very proud’, she said.\nThe Long Lost Family host believed that ‘in my head, I was literally the healthiest person in the world... And I had this head-to-toe scan. \n'And they came back and they went, “Okay, we’ve got your results. Um... we’d like to talk to you.”’\nDespite the severity of her condition, she was determined to avoid pity.\n‘I just did not want the drama, right? I felt like the drama would make it a hundred times worse for me. I don’t want limp necks. “Oh my God, oh my...” I don’t want pity. Because a lot of people have said to me since, “When you told me, I thought you could die.”\n‘And I thought, “I don’t want people looking at me like I could die. I’m dealing with that myself.” I just want positivity.’\n\nShe said her boyfriend, hairdresser Michael Douglas ‘played the piano and sang some songs and sort of did speeches' \n\n WHAT IS A COLLOID CYST? \n\nA colloid cyst is a slow-growing tumour typically found near the center of the brain. \nThe benign growth contains gelatinous material.\nMost patients present with headaches, although other symptoms including vertigo, memory problems and double vision can occur.\nIf large enough, a colloid cyst obstructs the movement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain.\nThis results in a build up of CSF in the ventricles of the brain and raises pressure in the skull.\nSurgery may be required promptly in order to reduce the relatively high risk of sudden death.\nSource: UCLA Department of Neurosurgery \n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavina has been open about her health scare and previously gave an emotional update in an Instagram video as she urged others to get private health checks if they can afford it \nNow, as she recovers, the author sees life with a fresh perspective.\n‘I feel like life’s never going to be the same again, but in rather a good way.’\nShe added: ‘A life lived in fear is a life half-lived. Write your bucket list now. Don’t wait until it’s too late.’\nDavina has been open about her health scare and previously gave an emotional update in an Instagram video as she urged others to get private health checks if they can afford it.\nThe My Mum Your Dad presenter had her tumour picked up at a private clinic when she was offered a health check after taking part in a talk about menopause.\nDiscussing her progress after the surgery, she explained: 'I really feel a lot more myself now. I feel way better.\n'My sense of gratitude is growing by the day, I'm crying a bit less which is good. I'm really looking forward to Christmas.\n'I want to talk about the place I did my health check. I didn't sing about it from the roof tops is it costs more than most people could afford. It's expensive - BUT it did save my life. But it is prohibitively expensive for most.\n'The NHS also offers loads of other checks too. So get them - get the health check. Preventative medicine is better than reactive medicine.\n'Eat well, do exercise, be less stressed. I just feel so grateful now. I'd like to say a massive thank you to all the staff at the clinics - I'm pretty sure you saved my life.'\nBrand new episodes of Begin Again drop Thursdays at 8am GMT wherever you get your podcasts.\nMichael DouglasBig Brother TopicDavina McCall\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDavina McCall reveals she named her brain tumour and even threw it a PARTY with speeches, songs and her boyfriend playing piano - but was so scared of dying she wrote farewell letters to her children\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nLiam Payne's girlfriend breaks silence on star's final days and reveals why she left Argentina before his death - while saying 'I'm not to blame'\n\nTantrum - no tiara!

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy HANNAH MCDONALD \n Published:21:20 GMT, 5 February 2025 |Updated:21:25 GMT, 5 February 2025 \n\nTess Daly's lookalike daughter Phoebe joined her dad Vernon Kay as the pair celebrated the EE Rising Star nominees.\nThe broadcaster, 50, and his eldest daughter Phoebe, 20, who he shares with the Strictly Come Dancing judge, were among the stars in attendance at the Vanity Fair EE Rising Star party. \nThe father-daughter duo celebrated the nominees ahead of the EE BAFTA Film Awards at a party at The Four Seasons Hotel's Pavyllon London restaurant, London, on Wednesday. \nVernon looked dapper for the event as he stepped out in a double-breasted suit with a navy turtleneck sweater underneath. \nMeanwhile Phoebe looked glamorous in a sleek black low-cut cami top paired with matching flared trousers. \nShe paired the co-ord with sparkly silver stilettos and a metallic handbag, as well as a collection of diamond jewellery. \n\nTess Daly's lookalike daughter Phoebe joined her dad Vernon Kay as the pair celebrated the EE Rising Star nominees in London on Wednesday\n\nThe broadcaster, 50, and his eldest daughter Phoebe, 20, who he shares with the Strictly Come Dancing judge, were among the stars in attendance at the Vanity Fair EE Rising Star party\nPhoebe again looked the spitting image of her famous mother as she appeared alongside her father Vernon in an EE Christmas commercial in December. \nIn the fun ad the Radio 2 DJ was put in charge of holiday preparations but was forced to enlist to tiny pet pooch Mickey to find the Christmas decorations. \nAnd Phoebe also mucked in when when her hapless father seemingly forgot to order a turkey for the festivities. \nMeanwhile last month, Tess posed for a photo with her look-a-like daughter as she gave an insight into her family's Christmas. \nThe Strictly Come Dancing presenter, 55, and her eldest daughter smiled for a mirror selfie while her husband Vernon took to the stage for his panto stint. \nIn the snap, Tess wore a halter neck top adorned with shiny gold sequins, which she paired with black trousers and hoop earrings.\nMeanwhile, Phoebe put on a stunning display in a black ballgown with a crossover design and cut out detailing.\nAnother photo showed Vernon in his role as Aladdin at Wycombe's Swan Theatre, while a third included Tess' Christmas dinner. \n\nThe father-daughter duo celebrated the nominees ahead of the EE BAFTA Film Awards at a party at The Four Seasons Hotel's Pavyllon London restaurant, London\n\nVernon looked dapper for the event as he stepped out in a double-breasted suit with a navy turtleneck sweater underneath\n\nMeanwhile Phoebe looked glamorous in a sleek black low-cut cami top paired with matching flared trousers\n\nMeanwhile last month, Tess posed for a photo with her look-a-like daughter as she gave an insight into her family's Christmas \n'That’s a wrap on party season for another year,' she captioned to Instagram update. \nPhoebe has frequently been spotted at glamorous events with her famous parents in recent months as she makes a name for herself in the industry. \nSince turning 18, Phoebe has started creeping into the public eye, making her red carpet debut alongside her father at the John Wick Chapter 4 premiere last March.\nWhile TV presenter Vernon was on hand to support his daughter, he previously revealed that he and Tess insist his children don't live off their fame and must form 'their own careers.'\nIt's an important factor for the celebrity duo, who both fell into fame after being scouted as models and then turning to television.\nSpeaking to MailOnline in 2022, Vernon said he and his wife believe it's important for their offspring 'to find themselves' and not be given their 'life on a plate', crediting the pair's Northern backgrounds for shaping their parenting beliefs.\n\nTess and Vernon share two daughters, Phoebe and Amber \n\nPhoebe looked the spitting image of her famous mother as she appeared alongside her father in an EE Christmas commercial in December \nVernon said: 'We let them be independent when it comes to them and their futures because it's important that you allow them to find themselves, which is character building and personality development. \nTess is of the same thinking as her husband, telling MailOnline in 2021 how she kept her children 'grounded' against the trappings of fame and raises them with 'morals, respect and a work ethic.'\nThe Strictly host revealed that Phoebe didn't realise her mum worked on TV until she was seven years old as she and Vernon worked to keep their family shielded from the limelight. \n'She had no idea until she saw me once and said \"there's my mum!\" She just thought I went to work on a Saturday because to them it is work,' she explained. \nTess DalyVernon KayStrictly Come Dancing\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nTess Daly's lookalike daughter Phoebe joins dad Vernon Kay to

But once my laughing fit subsided — and who could help but laugh? Rep. Al Green (D-TX) was literally shaking his cane like Abe Simpson in front of the podium! — I felt a twinge of pity. It hadn’t occurred to them how embarrassing the visual would be, nor how frail they’d become, how utterly beaten. \n\nThey really thought this was going to move the political needle in their direction. Your heart has to break for them — at least a little.\n\nSo, too, did Democratic Senators believe their unsightly demonstrations at the confirmation hearings would reverse the tide. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand’s (D-NY) breathless and jittery diatribe about women and LGBTQ individuals serving in combat during Pete Hegseth’s confirmation hearing made Hegseth look downright serene by contrast. Likewise, the sound of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) hysterically cracking voice during Robert F. Kennedy Jr’s hearing — “No, I am not!” she shrieked in a previously undiscovered vocal register — made Kennedy’s scarred vocals sound melodious. \n\nThe split screens for Democrats have never been less favorable. And in this hyper-plugged-in political age, little else seems to matter.\n\nThat’s got to be what confounds them and perhaps hurts them the most right now. To Democrats and their media allies, MAGA is the American Taliban. Or, as Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) put it during the rally Tuesday, “Nazis” who should be “met in the streets.” And yet, the public continues to prefer the MAGA movement to them. According to a recent Quinnipiac poll, the Democratic Party is now viewed favorably by only 31% of the public, the lowest mark in the history of the poll. Meanwhile, the Trump-led GOP enjoys the largest favorability advantage it’s ever had. \n\nThis state of affairs leaves the Democratic Party with only two pathways forward. The first is to embrace political nihilism. Rather than implement the necessary changes to become a viable political party again, it can simply blame people for not being enlightened enough to submit to their rule. \n\nIf the Democratic National Committee’s recently completed search for a new chair is any indication, this appears to be the preferred route. During a public forum last week, Jonathan Capehart of the Washington Post asked prospective candidates to raise their hand if they believed racism and misogyny played a role in former Vice President Kamala Harris’s defeat in November. Each person raised their hand, and Capehart congratulated them for answering correctly. \n\n“That’s good, you all pass,” he said.\n\nThe emphasis on what’s supposedly wrong with the people as opposed to what’s wrong with Democrats is suicidal. It speaks to a party no longer concerned with winning elections because it no longer believes it can. \n\nIn this light, it’s no surprise that Democratic rhetoric is becoming increasingly threatening. The party is frustrated by its inability to win using conventional political methods. They are desperate and flailing wildly and failing to think things through. At this point, they might just prefer to watch the country burn. \n\n“If they do not see the light, we will bring the fire,” Pressley said ominously during her remarks on Tuesday. \n\nThe second path, of course, would be a sincere search of the soul. Doubtless, this would lead to a new generation taking the helm. There is a real hunger for change in some Democratic circles, but they remain too few in number to kickstart the process. \n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nTim Ryan’s reaction to the Schumer video captures their current mood:\n\n“I just don’t even know what to say anymore when I see this kind of stuff,” he posted Wednesday morning on X. “Is it Saturday Night Live or real life?

What We Know About NFL Player's Politics","text":"Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has largely avoided making direct political endorsements, but that hasn't stopped speculation about his political views.Why It MattersKelce is one of the NFL's most prominent players, with a growing cultural presence beyond football. His relationship with pop star Taylor Swift has amplified attention to his personal choices, including his political views.Fans and media alike have dissected his past actions, such as supporting the COVID-19 vaccine campaign and participating in national anthem protests, to draw conclusions about his ideology.What Are Travis Kelce's Political Views?According to records reviewed by Newsweek, Kelce's voter registration remains listed as \"none declared,\" indicating he has not officially aligned with any political party.In November, Kelce made headlines when he \"liked\" an Instagram post endorsing Kamala Harris for president. The post was made by Amanda Santa, his manager Aaron Eanes's girlfriend.While Kelce provided no direct commentary, social media users quickly took notice. Some viewed his engagement with the post as an endorsement, while others suggested it was simply an expression of support for a friend.Kelce's past actions have led some observers to interpret his politics as left-leaning. Sports writer Andrew Holleran pointed to several instances that align with progressive causes, including participating in a COVID-19 vaccine campaign, collaborating with Bud Light when the brand faced conservative backlash and appearing in socially progressive comedy sketches on Saturday Night Live.In one 2023 SNL sketch called \"Straight Male Friend,\" Kelce portrayed a straight man offering low-effort, low-stakes companionship to a gay man, played by Bowen Yang. The parody subtly addressed themes of masculinity and emotional expression.However, Kelce has refrained from making strong public statements on political candidates, even as his girlfriend, Swift, has been vocal. Swift endorsed Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, writing, \"I've done my research, and I've made my choice.\"​What Did Travis Kelce Say About Donald Trump?Kelce has been diplomatic when addressing political figures from both sides.He was asked about President Trump attending the game during media day ahead of Super Bowl LIX. Rather than commenting on Trump's policies or past remarks about Swift, Kelce responded, \"That's awesome. It's a great honor, I think you know, no matter who the president is, I know I'm excited because it's the biggest game of my life, you know, and having the president there—it's the best country in the world—and that's pretty cool.\"Trump has not held back in his criticism of Swift. After she endorsed Harris, Trump said in an interview with Fox & Friends, \"She's a very liberal person. She seems to always endorse a Democrat. And she'll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.\"​Days later, Trump escalated his comments, posting on Truth Social, \"I hate Taylor Swift.\"​What People Are SayingTaylor Swift spoke out about Donald Trump in a 2019 interview with The Guardian: \"[He's] gaslighting the American public into being like, 'if you hate the president, you hate America.'\"\"We're a democracy—at least, we're supposed to be—where you're allowed to disagree, dissent, debate. I really think that he thinks this is an autocracy,\" Swift said.What Happens NextWhether Kelce chooses to state his politics publicly remains to be seen. For now, his actions continue to be examined as clues to his political leanings.","summary":"Travis Kelce recently said, \"It's a great honor\" to have Trump at the Super Bowl.

The FCC is currently in the process of reviewing the planned merger between Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, with Skydance Media.\n\n However, this particular interview, which was conducted in the lead up to the presidential election, has also been a focus of President Trump. While running for office, Trump filed a $10 billion suit against CBS alleging that the network edited the interview to try to help Harris win the election, targeting the inclusion of a longer section of her response to a question about the conflict in the Middle East. \n\n In a tweet, FCC Chair Brendan Carr also said he would make the materials publicly available and would seek comment on the issues raised in the FCC complaint. \n\n “We are posting the same transcripts and videos of our interview with Vice President Kamala Harris that we provided to the FCC. They show – consistent with 60 Minutes‘ repeated assurances to the public – that the 60 Minutes broadcast was not doctored or deceitful,” CBS said in a statement on its website.\n\n “In reporting the news, journalists regularly edit interviews – for time, space or clarity. In making these edits, 60 Minutes is always guided by the truth and what we believe will be most informative to the viewing public – all while working within the constraints of broadcast television,” the statement continued. \n\n “The issue here concerns one question from 60 Minutes‘ interview with Kamala Harris: whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is listening to the Biden-Harris Administration. We broadcast a longer portion of the vice president’s answer on Face the Nation and broadcast a shorter excerpt from the same answer on 60 Minutes the next day. Each excerpt reflects the substance of the vice president’s answer. As the full transcript shows, we edited the interview to ensure that as much of the vice president’s answers to 60 Minutes‘ many questions were included in our original broadcast while fairly representing those answers. 60 Minutes‘ hard-hitting questions of the vice president speak for themselves,” the statement says. \n\n CBS included three full-length transcripts of the interviews with Harris as well as the corresponding videos, and had previously said it would comply with the FCC’s request for the same material. \n\n Carr, a Trump appointee, has threatened to revoke broadcast licenses for stations owned by networks that’ve drawn the president’s ire under the agency’s authority to ensure that public airwaves operate in the public interest.","summary":"FCC Chair Brendan Carr will seek public comment on the issues raised in the complaint.","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/60-minutes-transcripts-kamala-harris-interview-1236128037/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2183351225-e1730929165274.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-05 21:00:39","author":"Caitlin Huston","authors":["Caitlin Huston"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.112},{"id":287482072,"title":"FCC releases CBS News' raw '60 Minutes' transcript from Kamala Harris interview","text":"The Federal Communication Commission released the unedited transcript handed over by CBS News of its controversial \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. The raw transcript showed CBS News had aired only the first half of her response to \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker's question about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not \"listening\" to the Biden administration in a preview clip that aired on \"Face the Nation,\" but aired only the second half of her response during the primetime special. \"But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening,\" Whitaker said in the October 2024 interview. \"The Wall Street Journal said that he -- that your administration has repeatedly been blindsided by Netanyahu, and in fact, he has rebuffed just about all of your administration's entreaties.\" \"Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. And we're not going to stop doing that. We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end,\" Harris responded. CBS News did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. ‘60 MINUTES’ TRANSCRIPT AT CENTER OF TRUMP'S LAWSUIT AGAINST CBS IS VITAL TO INVESTIGATION, FCC CHAIR SAYS President Donald Trump's FCC Brendan Carr ordered CBS News to hand over the unedited transcript as part of its investigation into whether the network violated the FCC's \"news distortion\" policy after a complaint was filed. \"The policy says you can't swap answers out to make it look like somebody said something entirely different,\" Carr told Fox News' Dana Perino on Monday, later adding it would have been \"fine\" if it was edited for length and clarity. In a preview clip that aired on \"Face the Nation,\" Harris was asked why it seemed like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn’t listening to the U.S. \"Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of, many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region,\" Harris responded in the \"Face the Nation\" clip. ‘60 MINUTES’ PRODUCER DEFIANT AS CBS PARENT COMPANY MULLS SETTLING TRUMP LAWSUIT: ‘I WILL NOT APOLOGIZE’ Harris was mocked by conservatives for offering a lengthy \"word salad\" to Whitaker. But when that same question aired the following night in the primetime election special, a shorter, more focused answer from the vice president followed. \"We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end,\" Harris said in the primetime special. TRUMP COULD BE ON THE VERGE OF LEGAL VICTORY AGAINST CBS AS SETTLEMENT SPECULATION HEATS UP Critics accused CBS News of editing Harris' \"word salad\" answer to shield the vice president from further backlash, and there were calls for the network to release the full transcript after it only shared transcripts of what had aired. CBS News refused to release the raw transcript at the time. In October, Trump filed a $10 billion lawsuit against CBS News alleging election interference over its handling of the \"60 Minutes\" interview, accusing the network of aiding his Democratic rival through deceptive editing just days before the election. \"To paper over Kamala’s ‘word salad’ weakness, CBS used its national platform on 60 Minutes to cross the line from the exercise of judgment in reporting to deceitful, deceptive manipulation of news,\" the lawsuit stated. Trump attorneys argued the edits were done in an effort to \"attempt to tip the scales in favor of the Democratic Party as the heated 2024 Presidential Election — which President Trump is leading — approaches its conclusion.\" \"CBS’ partisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference through malicious, deceptive, and substantial news distortion calculated to confuse, deceive, and mislead the public,\" the lawsuit read.

His USAID crusade will decimate the Catholic relief agency","text":"The Trump administration’s ongoing effort to shut down or massively cut the U.S. Agency for International Development is putting the future of a major Catholic relief agency at risk, despite the Republican portraying himself as an ally to Catholics on the campaign trail.\n\nCatholic Relief Services, founded in 1943 by U.S. Catholic bishops, is the single largest recipient of funds from the development agency, which funds around half of the religious aid group’s $1.5 billion budget. \n\nLeaders of the group, where layoffs have already begun, warned staff of major changes because of the political climate, according to an email obtained by the National Catholic Reporter.\n\n\"We anticipate that we will be a much smaller overall organization by the end of this fiscal year,\" the relief agency’s president and CEO Sean Callahan told staff on Monday. \n\nObservers of the Catholic group argued that the White House’s attacks on the U.S. aid agency, which have included Trump adviser Elon Musk claiming without evidence the administration is a “criminal organization,” go against bedrock Christian and American principles of supporting the less fortunate. \n\n\"CRS is the Gospel at work and reflects the best of American values,\" John Carr, former executive director of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' Department of Justice, Peace and Human Development, told the National Catholic Reporter.\n\nCatholic Relief Services provides emergency and disaster assistance, as well as funding programs related to water, sanitation, agriculture, health and other areas serving an estimated 200 million people across over 100 countries. \n\nOn the campaign trail Trump, as well as Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic convert, sought to portray themselves as allies to U.S. Catholics.\n\nDuring an October rally, Trump claimed Kamala Harris was “very destructive to Christianity and very destructive to evangelicals and to the Catholic Church,” while Vance told supporters that Harris was the candidate “of anti-Christian and anti-Catholic bigotry,” and would further U.S. Catholics’ feeling of being “abandoned.”\n\nAs evidence, they pointed to the Democrat’s pro-abortion stances, as well as her questioning of judicial nominees about their membership in a Christian fraternal organization, and a leaked FBI memo the agency later disavowed describing efforts to probe links between radical Catholic groups and the far-right. \n\nDuring the campaign, Trump told an interviewer, “I stand for everything that you stand for and that the church stands for.”\n\nThe pitch paid off. The Trump campaign won the group handily, carrying Catholics by an estimated 20-point margin, according to exit polls, flipping the group from their 2020 support of Joe Biden. \n\nNonetheless, the alliance with Catholics does not seem to extend to their U.S.-funded relief work, with Musk claiming the U.S. development agency and its partners are part of a “radical-left political psy op.”\n\n“[Trump] agreed we should shut it down,” Musk said during a live discussion on X Spaces. “It became apparent that it’s not an apple with a worm in it. What we have is just a ball of worms. You’ve got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It’s beyond repair. We’re shutting it down.”\n\nIn recent days, senior staff at the administration have been placed on leave, contractors have been fired, staff have been barred from agency headquarters, and the Trump White House has instituted a 90-day pause on foreign aid. \n\n“We were inundated with a barrage of hostile, threatening messages,” one staffer told The Independent. “I think they were designed to instill fear.”\n\nThe campaign to slash the U.S. aid agency has prompted protests from Democrats, who rallied outside agency headquarters and have threatened to withhold future State Department confirmations until the group’s funding is restored.","summary":"Trump decisively won Catholic vote in 2024","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-musk-usaid-catholic-relief-b2692977.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/18/02/SEI226003157.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/KaXss1a3-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-05 20:44:05","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.237},{"id":287477978,"title":"Frenemies: Newsom comes hat in hand to meet Trump at White House","text":"Gov. Gavin Newsom and President Donald Trump — who have very visibly traded political fire but who also have worked together — meet at the White House on Wednesday as the California governor fights to secure more money for people and businesses devastated following last month's deadly wildfires in metropolitan Los Angeles. The trip is the first by Newsom to Washington, D.C., since Trump took over in the White House and is part of his efforts to obtain additional federal funding to aid in wildfire recovery from the horrific blazes that killed 29 people and destroyed over 12,000 homes and forced tens of thousands to evacuate. Newsom arrived in the nation's capital on the eve of his visit to the White House, and hours ahead of the meeting he headed to Capitol Hill to hold separate meetings with members of Congress. The governor traveled east a day after California lawmakers approved $25 million in legal funding proposed by the Democratic governor to challenge actions by the Trump administration. And the legislature also allocated another $25 million for legal groups to defend undocumented immigrants facing possible deportation by new Trump administration efforts. TRUMP MEETS WITH CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS, FIRE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TO SEE LA WILDFIRE DAMAGE FIRST HAND Newsom came to Washington, D.C., hat in hand. Late last month, the governor approved $2.5 billion for fire recovery work, which he hopes will be reimbursed by the federal government. And the state will likely need much more help from the federal government, as the bill to cover rebuilding costs is expected to reach into the tens of billions of dollars. \"The Governor’s trip is focused on securing critical disaster aid for the survivors of the Los Angeles fires and ensuring impacted families who lost their homes and livelihoods have the support they need to rebuild and recover,\" spokesperson Izzy Gardon said in a statement. After the outbreak of the fires early last month, Trump repeatedly criticized Newsom's handling of the immense crisis. He has accused the governor of mismanaging forestry and water policy and, pointing to intense backlash over a perceived lack of preparation, called on Newsom to step down. \"Gavin Newscum should resign. This is all his fault!!!\" Trump charged in a social media post on Jan. 8, as he repeated a derogatory name he often labels the governor. Trump also placed blame for the deadly wildfires on Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, another Democrat, and the policies approved by state lawmakers in heavily blue California. In an executive order issued last month, he described management of the state's land and water resources as \"disastrous.\" Newsom — the governor of the nation's most populous state, one of the Democratic Party's leaders in the resistance against the returning president and a potential White House contender in 2028 — pushed back against Trump, as the two larger-than-life politicians traded fire. Disputing Trump, the governor noted that reservoirs in the southern part of California were full when the fires first sparked, and has argued that no amount of water could tackle fires fueled by winds of up to 100 miles per hour. Newsom also charged Trump had spread \"hurricane-force winds of mis- and disinformation.\" NEWSOM CALLS TRUMP'S CLAIMS 'PURE FICTION' AFTER HE POINTED FINGER OVER CALIFORNIA FIRE TRAGEDY Trump met with Newsom as he arrived in Los Angeles late last month — just four days after his inauguration as president — to survey the fire damage. Trump had threatened to withhold wildfire aid until certain stipulations were met in California, including changes to water policy and requiring an ID to vote, but now appears willing to work with Newsom. \"Thank you first for being here. It means a great deal to all of us,\" Newsom told Trump as he greeted the president upon his arrival in Los Angeles last month. \"We’re going to need your support. We’re going to need your help.\" The president declared that \"we're looking to get something completed. And the way you get it completed is to work together.\" The wildfires are far from the first time Newsom and Trump took aim at each other. Their animosity dated back to before Trump was elected president the first time in 2016, when Newsom was California's lieutenant governor. The verbal fireworks continued over the past two years, as Newsom served as a top surrogate on the campaign trail for former President Joe Biden and then former Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced Biden as the Democrats' 2024 standard-bearer last summer. Following Trump's convincing election victory over Harris in November, Newsom moved to \"Trump-proof\" his heavily blue state. \"He is using the term ‘Trump-Proof’ as a way of stopping all of the GREAT things that can be done to ‘Make California Great Again,’ but I just overwhelmingly won the Election,\" Trump responded. Since their meeting in Los Angeles, Newsom has appeared to be more restrained in his criticism of Trump. Following Trump's orders, the US Army Corps of Engineers last week opened two dams in Central California, letting roughly 2.2 billion gallons of water flow out of reservoirs. Trump celebrated the move in posts to Truth Social post on Friday and Sunday, declaring, \"the water is flowing in California,\" and adding the water was \"heading to farmers throughout the State, and to Los Angeles.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But water experts argue that the newly released water won't flow to Los Angeles, and it is being wasted by being released during California's normally wet winter season. Newsom, apparently aiming to rebuild the working relationship he had with Trump during the president's first term in the White House, didn't raise any objections to the water release.

A group brought a non-frivolous complaint, so the FCC is taking the next appropriate step in adjudicating the issue.”\n\nCarr, who was appointed by Trump to lead the agency, refused to rule out the possibility that he would seek testimony from “60 Minutes” producers and correspondent Bill Whitaker, who conducted the Harris interview, people close to the matter told the Post.\n\nCritics argue CBS News has shifted from its once-neutral stance, particularly in the lead-up to the 2024 election. Some point to the network’s aggressive fact-checking of Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, during the vice presidential debate and the internal pushback against “CBS Mornings” anchor Tony Dokoupil after his pointed questioning of writer Ta-Nehisi Coates regarding Israel’s response to the October 7 Hamas attack.\n\nTrump, a longtime critic of mainstream media, may use findings from the FCC’s inquiry to support his case against CBS. Although the network denies accusations of bias, it is reportedly engaged in early settlement discussions with Trump. Some analysts compare the situation to Disney’s $16 million settlement with Trump following ABC News host George Stephanopoulos’s mischaracterization of a civil ruling against him.\n\nCarr, who has been vocal about media regulation issues, has also scrutinized potential security threats posed by the Chinese-owned app TikTok. His investigation into CBS’s editorial decisions has garnered significant attention, especially in light of the pending Paramount-Skydance deal.\n\nControversy surrounding the Harris interview deepened after “60 Minutes” aired a preview depicting her as offering a coherent response to a question about the Middle East, while the edited broadcast version portrayed her answer differently. \n\nWhile proving deliberate bias is challenging given First Amendment protections, FCC regulations still require network news broadcasts on public airwaves to maintain impartiality. \n\nIf violations are found, Carr could impose conditions on the Paramount-Skydance merger aimed at ensuring greater journalistic integrity.\n\nA spokesperson for Skydance declined to comment, while CBS News reaffirmed its commitment to accurate and balanced reporting. \n\nAs the FCC review progresses, media analysts are closely watching how it might influence future regulatory policies and journalistic accountability.","summary":"Tiffany Network published two never-before-seen excerpts from the sit-down, which critics say was deceptively edited to help the Democratic nominee.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/05/media/cbs-releases-unedited-video-of-60-minutes-interview-with-kamala-harris/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/Comp-FCC-60-min.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-05 20:21:54","author":"Ariel Zilber,Josh Kosman","authors":["Ariel Zilber","Josh Kosman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.085},{"id":287486658,"title":"Whoopi Goldberg Slams ‘Phony’ Weight Loss Ad Using Her Likeness With AI","text":"On Feb. 5’s episode of The View, host Whoopi Goldberg stopped the show from taking a commercial break to give a warning: she says there is an Instagram ad using an AI version of her likeness to sell weight loss drugs without her consent. \n\n “There’s a phony weight loss ad floating around online, on Instagram, that has me — uh huh,” she said angrily to an audibly abhorred crowd . “AI-mouthed, saying all kinds of stuff about — you know, I don’t sell anything.

Carr also suggested that the Trump administration may go after the public funding of PBS and NPR member stations entirely.\n\n“For my own part, I do not see a reason why Congress should continue sending taxpayer dollars to NPR and PBS given the changes in the media marketplace since the passage of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967,” he wrote.\n\nThis has to be seen as the opening salvo in what is likely to be a Trump war against press freedoms generally.\n\nFor starters, the claim that underwriting messages are really commercials in disguise is a red herring. Ever since the Communications Act of 1982, the law has been quite precise on what constitutes permissible underwriting and what constitutes a commercial.\n\nThere is a great deal of case law on what is allowed and what isn’t. Every once in a while, one of the more aggressive big-city public radio stations crosses the line and accepts product promotion in an underwriting credit, and gets a warning or a fine. But the last such fine was in 2008. The FCC under both Republicans and Democrats has been quite consistent in applying these standards\n\nIf the Trump administration wanted to take the next step, it could simply abolish the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. This would be damaging but not fatal, since over time public radio and TV stations have cultivated their listeners to provide more and more of their funding. Currently, the typical NPR member station gets only about 5 to 10 percent of its income from underwriting and about 10 percent from CPB.\n\nMost of their funding comes from listeners. And a full-scale political assault on public broadcasting would likely lead to more support fom listeners. But NPR itself, with less direct listener support, gets about a third of its budget from corporate underwriters.\n\nKilling CPB would be relatively more damaging to smaller stations in less densely populated rural states, where there are relatively fewer listeners or viewers to draw upon. Smaller stations are more reliant on CPB. Ironically, many of these are in red states, where the local public station is often the only source of in-depth news. On the other hand, destroying fair news coverage may be the whole point.\n\nIf the Trumpers wanted to go further, they could try to deny license renewal to public stations. That would be more difficult, since FCC broadcast licenses are for eight years.\n\nTHIS OPENING SALVO AGAINST PUBLIC BROADCASTING needs to be seen in the larger context of an escalating war against the free press. Unlike some larger commercial media, NPR has done an admirable job of covering Trump’s attempted coup, and not pulling their punches. So far, Trump has focused on larger media, and has succeeded in intimidating many of the major dailies into self-censorship.\n\nJeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post, has other business interests and has been shameless about sucking up to Trump. The New York Times has pursued a pathetic “objectivity,” in the face of incipient fascism. The L.A. Times has been abjectly pro-Trump. And the commercial TV networks, all with other business interests to protect, have tried various forms of appeasement.\n\nFor instance, Paramount, the owner of CBS, has merger talks pending with Skydance that would enrch the largest stockholder, Shari Redstone. Paramount has been in settlement talks on Trump’s lawsuit against CBS, and has leaned on 60 Minutes to accede to Trump’s request for raw interview footage of their interview with Kamala Harris and give Trump an apology. MSNBC journalists have critized their parent, NBC, for delaying the airing of a documentary about the effects of Trump’s policies on migrant families separated at the southern U.S. border until after the election.\n\nAs Trump escalates this war, one easy strategy would be to have Elon Musk’s billions flood the media zone with endless libel suits.

He said his organization changed its name to Arab Americans for Peace two days ago, reflecting its shift in focus following Trump's election.Trump outlined the idea for the U.S. to \"take over\" Gaza during a White House press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday.

Some also credit Trump with orchestrating a ceasefire, even though it happened before he entered the White House.Rabiul Chowdhury, co-founder of Muslims for Trump, said that while he was frustrated that no viable long-term solution for peace and rebuilding was being discussed for Gaza, he does not regret backing Trump.\"Conflating Trump's rhetoric with the actions of Biden and Harris is not only disingenuous but outright dishonest,\" he said, criticizing the Biden administration's supply of weapons and other support for Israel while it bombed Gaza. \"If we were to equate Trump's actions with those of Biden and Harris, the contrast would be undeniable — Trump is the better option.\"Former President Joe Biden's administration stood firmly by Israel during its assault on Gaza despite repeatedly pushing Israel to do more to curb civilian casualties and allow humanitarian aid into the enclave. Biden also hailed a ceasefire deal that went into effect last month as largely mirroring the framework of a proposal he made last year.Osama Siblani, publisher of Arab American News based in Dearborn, Michigan, said he didn't think many people in the community would regret their decision to either back Trump or withhold a vote for Harris due to her support of Israel.But Siblani, a spokesperson for the Arab American Political Action Committee, which endorsed neither candidate in the 2024 election, likened Trump's rhetoric to that of a \"crazy man\" and said they would not advance the cause of peace.\"Instead of helping people to recover, he's trying to take advantage of their of their misery,\" he told Reuters. \"I can't believe that a president of the United States is making such a suggestion.\"Yahya Basha, a doctor and founder of Muslims for American Progress, said he was not surprised by Trump's comments, given earlier statements by his son-in-law Jared Kushner about Gaza being a good site for a future resort, but remained skeptical that the U.S. would execute those plans.\"I don't regret anything I did to get Trump elected and I hope we see positive signs in the future,\" said Basha, an early advocate for Trump in Michigan.Instead, he said he believed Trump's comments were often provocative rather than the basis of policy, citing his comments on wanting to buy Greenland or make Canada the 51st state of the U.S.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"U.S. Arab American and Muslim leaders, including some who supported Donald Trump in the 2024 election, criticized the president's proposal for the U.S. to take over Gaza and resettle Palestinians as unacceptable.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/arab-american-muslim-leaders-decry-trump-comments-on-gaza-7643842","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-12/lbm9125_gaza_625x300_29_December_24.jpeg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-05 19:53:30","author":"Amit Rajpurohit","authors":["Amit Rajpurohit"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":287474976,"title":"Will Donald Trump bump into Taylor Swift at the Super Bowl, and will they support the same team, the Kansas City Chiefs?

Schools that are not in compliance, the official later warned, are “putting their federal funding in jeopardy vis a vis the US government.”\n\nTrump has been advocating for dismantling the Department of Education. If that endeavor is successful, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the administration “will look at additional maneuvers to ensure that these very important policies can be implemented.”\n\nThe Trump administration also believes it has a “role to play” with sporting bodies, the official said, and plans to bring sporting organizations to the White House to “listen to the stories of female athletes and their parents.”\n\nAdditionally, Trump “does expect the Olympic Committee and the NCAA to no longer allow men to compete in women’s sports,” Leavitt said.\n\nWhile Trump does not have legal authority over the International Olympic Committee or National Collegiate Athletics Association, Leavitt said the executive action “starts a very public pressure campaign on these organizations.”\n\n“He expects these organizations to comply with this federal executive order,” she said.\n\nAnd there are plans to convene state attorneys general to enforce “laws on the books protecting women’s sports” at the state level, the official said. Trump on Wednesday is expected to meet with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who in 2023 signed a state law banning trans athletes in college sports in his state.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, the official added, will be using bodies like the United Nations to promote the administration’s stance through reports on gender issues.\n\nThe executive action also calls for a review of visa policies: “If you are coming into the country and you are claiming that you are a woman, but you are a male here to compete against women, we’re going to be reviewing that for fraud,” the official said.\n\nTrump’s acting on a divisive campaign issue\n\nIn his first week of his second term, Trump signed an executive order that prevented transgender people from serving in the military, resurrecting an order he initially implemented in 2017 during his first term but was later reversed by President Joe Biden’s administration. Trump’s order is facing a legal fight brought on by six transgender service members and two transgender people who want to enlist.\n\nAnother order Trump signed sought to have transgender women detained in federal facilities be housed in men’s facilities. Three transgender women housed in women’s facilities sued over the policy, and a federal judge earlier this week blocked the Trump administration from enforcing it.\n\nIn the closing months of the campaign, Trump and his allies poured millions into television ads attacking then-Vice President Kamala Harris over her past support of certain rights for transgender people — a message spread during nationally televised NFL games, college football broadcasts and in battleground states.\n\nRepublicans up and down the ballot spent staggering sums on TV ads on the issue, despite most voters saying it’s a topic that wasn’t a top priority for them in the 2024 election.\n\nTrump, for example, repeatedly invoked Imane Khelif, an Algerian female Olympic boxer that he baselessly said “transitioned” into manhood.\n\nEven before launching his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump escalated his rhetoric against the LGBTQ community — specifically transgender Americans — in ways that he largely avoided in the lead-up to his 2016 win and throughout his four years in Washington. At an appearance in July 2022, Trump voiced his opposition to transgender women participating in women’s athletics, marveling at the applause it generated and insisting his advisers had advocated against including it in his remarks.\n\n“They said, ‘Don’t do it,’” Trump said. “And it gets the biggest hand. It’s crazy.”\n\nCritics have said Trump seeks to shape policy around an issue that does not exist on a large scale. Out of the approximately 510,000 athletes who compete across the NCAA, fewer than 10 are known to be transgender, NCAA President Charlie Baker told a Senate panel last year.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Trump actively courted those groups and polls indicate he made significant gains.\n\nProtests against the Biden administration’s stance led to more than 700,000 “uncommitted” votes in the Democratic primaries, an attempt to pressure Joe Biden to shift course.\n\nLayla Elabed, the co-chair of the Uncommitted National Movement responded to Trump’s remarks and said that she felt “sad, angry, and scared for our communities”.\n\nThe Uncommitted movement opposed a Trump presidency, but ultimately declined to endorse Kamala Harris, citing her “unwillingness to shift” on Biden’s policies.\n\n“For months, we warned about the dangers of Trump at home and abroad but our calls largely went unheard,” Elabed wrote. Harris, she said, “left a vacuum by not visiting Michigan families impacted by US-supplied bombs to help create a permission structure for their trust while Trump visited Dearborn and filled a community in despair with lies”.\n\nShe continued: “Trump’s illegal calls for ethnic cleansing are horrific but as on so many other issues, Democrats had a chance to persuade voters they were the better alternative and they blew it.”\n\nJames Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, which conducted an October poll of Arab American voters, noted at the time that in the institute’s 30 years of polling, it had not “witnessed anything like the role that the war on Gaza is having on voter behavior”. Another recent poll found that 29% of 2020 Biden voters who opted for a different candidate than Harris in 2024 cited “ending Israel’s violence in Gaza” as their top issue.\n\nOn Wednesday, Zogby described Trump’s comments about the US taking Gaza in an interview as “dangerous, provocative, illegal and callously insensitive to Palestinian needs”.\n\n“Anyone who knows the region knows Palestinians are not going to leave,” he said. “And if they want to go anywhere, it’s back to their villages in Israel they were expelled from in 1948.”\n\nJustin Amash, a former Republican congressman from Michigan whose family is of Palestinian origin, compared Trump’s proposal on Tuesday to ethnic cleansing.\n\n“If the United States deploys troops to forcibly remove Muslims and Christians – like my cousins – from Gaza, then not only will the US be mired in another reckless occupation but it will also be guilty of the crime of ethnic cleansing,” he said. “No American of good conscience should stand for this.\n\nWa’el Alzayat, the chief executive officer of EmgageUSA, a Muslim American advocacy organization, said that “evicting people from their land is a violation of international law” and that sending US troops to Gaza was not only “deeply problematic” but also, he imagined, “politically very unpopular”.\n\nAlzayat was one of a number of prominent Arab Americans the Guardian spoke with who traced the blame back to Biden.\n\nHe said that in his view, “the reason we have Trump contemplating turning the rubble into Miami-style condos that Jared Kushner could probably profit from is because Biden gave those bombs to the Israelis”.\n\nRashida Tlaib, a Democratic representative of Michigan and the only Palestinian American member of Congress, said in response to Trump’s comments that “Palestinians aren’t going anywhere” and that Trump “can only spew this fanatical bullshit because of bipartisan support in Congress for funding genocide and ethnic cleansing”.\n\nRuwa Romman, a Georgia state representative who is Palestinian American, said in a statement on Tuesday that she was “furious with everyone”.\n\nRomman was put forward by the Uncommitted movement to speak at the Democratic national convention, but the request was reportedly denied. She ultimately endorsed Harris.\n\n“Everyone failed,” she said. “Everyone is responsible for the moment that we are in today. The idea that voters do not carry any responsibility is untenable and absurd. The idea that candidates don’t carry any responsibility is untenable and absurd.”\n\nRomman added: “No fascist here or abroad will ever be able to erase Palestinians,” adding that the “harder they try the deeper our roots will grow”.\n\nHudhayfah Ahmad, the director of media relations for the Abandon Harris campaign, which supported Jill Stein, said in a statement: “The Biden-Harris administration’s full, unobstructed support for Israel’s campaign of genocide and ethnic cleansing has failed to remove the Palestinians of Gaza from their land.”\n\n“It is not Trump – just as it was not Biden or Harris – who decides what the Palestinians can or cannot do; that decision belongs solely to the people of Palestine,” Ahmad said.\n\nIn response to finger-pointing at voters who turned on Harris, Waleed Shahid, a former organizer for the Uncommitted movement and a Democratic strategist, called for introspection.\n\n“Democratic party elites find it easier to punch down on grieving Palestinian families in Michigan desperate for a basic shift in their party’s policy than to challenge decisions made by Biden and Harris,” Shahid wrote. “But this is why Democrats lose – they don’t

social media?","text":"Often called digital natives, most young Australians use multiple social media platforms.\n\nBut in the wake of some big changes to platforms like Meta and TikTok, do young Australians still trust social media?\n\nShanti, 21, says there are lots of good things on social media, but you need to know what to believe.\n\n\"I don't trust social media,\" she says.\n\n\"But don't get me wrong … there's so much knowledge and … so many interesting things.\n\n\"You need to know what to believe and what not to believe as well.\"\n\nAshleigh, 20, agrees.\n\nShe says it is important to fact check what you see on social media.\n\n\"I've seen a lot of things about the LA fires,\" Ashleigh says.\n\nIn September 2020, the eSafety Commissioner surveyed 627 teens aged 12 to 17.\n\nThe resulting Digital Lives of Aussie Teens study showed teens spent an average of 14.4 hours a week online.\n\nThey used an average of four different social media services.\n\nOn top of that, a 2020 survey by media organisation The Conversation shows children and teenagers increasingly get news from social media.\n\nBut, of late, young people seem to be having trust issues with social media.\n\nWhat could be behind it?\n\nSocial media giants in political arena\n\nA lot of the social media bosses gathered at US President Donald Trump's January 20 inauguration.\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was seated with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google's Sundar Pichai and Tesla and X chief executive Elon Musk.\n\nNow, the president has even appointed Mr Musk as \"a special government employee\".\n\nWhile plenty of US presidential candidates, including Kamala Harris, have had well-funded support groups, Mr Musk's involvement with Mr Trump has come under criticism.\n\nMeta's boss Mark Zuckerberg has fired fact checkers, saying Mr Trump's election win represents a \"cultural tipping point\" in favour of free speech, and his company will work with Trump to push back on censorship.\n\nYoung Australians question power\n\nAll this has made young people a bit sceptical about social media.\n\nLincoln, 16, is worried about the platforms being used to push a certain political agenda.\n\n\"And they'll try to make people agree with them more.\"\n\nLiam, 16, agrees, saying the social media giants could use their platforms to \"influence\" people.\n\nSaul, 15, says it all translates to a \"lot of power over the world\".\n\nVittoria Elliott is a journalist with Wired, a US-based digital magazine that examines technology and its effect on culture, including social and politics.\n\nHer beat is covering \"platforms and power\", which she says have become deeply entwined with the US government now.\n\nShe says the social media moguls own incredibly wide-reaching, powerful platforms.\n\n\"Donald Trump was incredibly prickly with Meta and Mark Zuckerberg when they started doing things like fact checking … a response to Donald Trump's election in 2016.\n\n\"The internet was full of all this unreliable information, and it was threatening to democracy, and so there needed to be these fact-checking programs.\"\n\nBut she says now Meta has pre-emptively moved to roll back its fact-checking program.\n\n\"There is no government order telling them they have to do that,\" Ms Elliot says.\n\nWe also saw how, on day one of his presidency, Mr Trump signed an order guaranteeing \"freedom of speech\" on social media.\n\nBut some teens, like Shanti, 21, feel that might be a good thing.\n\n\"There might be a bit more freedom, and we might be able to see more things online that weren't online before … people's opinions on things that are a bit controversial,'\" she says.\n\nNot the end of social media\n\nSo, what does it all mean for young people and their social media usage?\n\nDoes it mean they will be leaving in droves?\n\nMaybe not, says Wired reporter Vittoria Elliott.\n\n\"People might want to get off Facebook or Instagram, but then it would make it hard to keep in touch with people. \n\n\"They might want to get off Twitter, but then where would they get their news?\"","summary":"Often called digital natives, most young
