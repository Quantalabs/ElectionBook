By the time he became the Republican nominee in 2016, Trump and his businesses had been involved in over 4,000 lawsuits. His litigious streak has continued, leading to a second term where Trump is actively litigating multiple cases. Here’s a rundown of some of the big lawsuits that Trump, the private citizen, is pursuing while also still being president.\n\nSo mad about the media\n\nTrump has not yet sued CNN or The New York Times over their coverage of Iran. He did, however, have his personal lawyer send them letters threatening to sue, which is an absolutely unhinged thing to do, and a deliberate blurring of the lines between his role as president and his role as a private citizen. \n\nLate Tuesday night, Paramount, the parent company of CBS, announced it would pay Trump $16 million to settle his whiny lawsuit where he alleged the network had deceptively edited an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nThat’s almost the same amount Disney paid in December 2024 to settle Trump’s baseless defamation lawsuit against ABC. To make things look slightly less like a straight-up bribe, these millions belong to Trump’s eventual presidential library rather than Trump personally. Nope, still looks like a bribe. \n\nTrump also still has a lawsuit against Iowa pollster Ann Selzer and the Des Moines Register over her poll that predicted Harris would win Iowa. Well, he has two of them now, actually. Trump initially filed his suit in Iowa state court, but Gannett, the parent company of the Register, removed the case to federal court. \n\nIn June, Trump tried to get the case back in state court, but the federal judge denied the request. So Trump decided to voluntarily dismiss his federal case and refile in state court. That didn’t really work out either.\n\nThe judge in the federal case, U.S. District Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger, struck Trump’s voluntary dismissal from the record, saying that because Trump had earlier filed a notice of appeal to the Eighth Circuit, that court now has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the case. Were Ebinger to grant the voluntary dismissal of the district court case, she would functionally be dismissing Trump’s appeal as well, which the district court doesn’t have the power to do. So, Trump needs to voluntarily dismiss his federal appeal first. \n\nYes, this is wonky procedural stuff, but that’s what lawyers are for. Unfortunately, in this instance, it appears that Trump’s personal attorneys aren’t super-sharp about basic court rules. But rest assured—their client seems to have all the time and money in the world to keep pursuing this in whatever court will take it. \n\nSo mad about the money he owes\n\nDuring his time away from the presidency, Trump lost not one, but two cases to E. Jean Carroll. In May 2023, a jury found him liable for sexually abusing Carroll when he assaulted her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s and awarded Carroll $5 million. Then, in January 2024, a jury awarded Carroll $83.3 million in a separate case over Trump's defamation of her, following the May 2023 verdict. He’s still battling to make both of those go away. \n\nThe full Second Circuit Court of Appeals just declined to reconsider the $5 million verdict, which likely means the next stop is the friendly confines of the United States Supreme Court. And if you’re wondering if Trump will try to argue that he is somehow immune from this civil lawsuit about a sexual assault he committed 20 years before becoming president? Absolutely. How can we be sure? Because that’s basically the argument he just made to the Second Circuit in his attempt to overturn the $83 million verdict. \n\nDuring oral arguments last month, Trump’s personal attorney said that the verdict against Trump “severely damages the presidency” and that “President Trump was denied the protection of presidential immunity” when the trial judge let Carroll’s case proceed. It seems incredibly self-evident that Trump’s presidential immunity does not reach back in time to protect him from the consequences of his actions decades ago. Then again, no one could have expected the Supreme Court to make up that immunity doctrine out of whole cloth. Expect this one to go all the way up as well, and brace yourself for the possibility of a really, really stupid outcome. \n\nSo mad about his criminal conviction\n\nWinning the 2024 election freed Trump from the dozens of federal criminal charges he faced, but it couldn’t undo his conviction in New York state on 34 felony counts over his falsification of business records to hide his payoff to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election. He’s continuing to appeal that in the state courts, but he’s also begging the Second Circuit to let him move the criminal case to federal court. \n\nIt should be in federal court, per Trump, because, you guessed it, he believes his presidential immunity covers his criminal acts before becoming president. It should also be in federal court, Trump’s lawyers told the Second Circuit, because the scope of his immunity should be decided “by this court and the Supreme Court, not by New York State courts.” \n\nIn other words, the goal, as ever, is to get in front of a Supreme Court that has proven remarkably receptive to letting Trump off the hook. \n\nSo mad about Russia, still?\n\nThis case, where Trump sued the Pulitzer Prize Board for defaming him, has flown under the radar for a while, but it’s heating up now in ways that highlight exactly how bad it is that the sitting president is also a private litigant. \n\nBut first: How did the board defame him, exactly? By refusing to retract awards to the Washington Post and The New York Times for their coverage of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump demanded the awards be retracted, and the Pulitzer Board indulged him far more than they should have, conducting an independent review of all the stories. The board concluded that nothing in the award-winning stories had been discredited and declined to retract the awards, and Trump says that defames him. \n\nThis is a ridiculous case, and it should have been dismissed out of hand. But Trump drew an exceedingly friendly three-judge panel in Florida state court that ruled, in February 2025, that he could proceed. How friendly, exactly? Peep the concurrence by Judge Ed Artau, which kicks off by quoting some of Trump’s favorite phrases and glowingly recaps Trump’s complaint. \n\nThat concurrence served as a nice little sizzle reel for Artau, who Trump rewarded two months later with a nomination to the federal bench. And, as Jay Willis points out over at Balls and Strikes, Artau may have known he was under consideration when he wrote that suck-up concurrence. \n\nThis is a not-great collision between Trump’s role as president and his role as private litigant. He’s able to reward judges who rule in his favor in private matters with a reward that he can only extend because of his role as president. \n\nIt gets worse, actually. The Pulitzer Board has been attempting to put this case on hold until Trump is no longer president, given the complexities of litigating against the sitting president and the potential conflict between a state court’s exercise of judicial power and the president’s federal Article II powers. The board pointed out that Trump has argued in other civil cases that litigation would interfere with his duties as president, warranting a stay until the end of his term.\n\nNope, said that friendly appeals panel in May. Only Trump can invoke the privilege of saying he’s too busy being president to participate in litigation. That appellate panel went even farther, saying that if Trump sues someone, that’s cool because he is “uniquely equipped to determine how to use his time, to assess the attention a lawsuit will require, and to decide whether the lawsuit will divert him from his official business.” \n\nBut if someone sues Trump, he gets to decide if that’s too onerous. Needless to say, the Pulitzer Board is appealing this nonsense up to the state Supreme Court. \n\nSo mad at his former business partners\n\nBecause the president now runs private for-profit companies while also being president, said president now gets hauled into court over private business disputes. Also, because said president is a grifter with no loyalty, he gets hauled into court because his business associates allege that he screwed them over. \n\nTwo cofounders of Truth Social, Trump’s low-energy social media platform, sued Trump in 2024, alleging he tried to dilute their stake in the company and ice them out of the initial public offering. When the case was before the Delaware Chancery Court in May 2025, Trump argued the suit should be dismissed or stayed until the end of his term, as he is immune from civil suits while in office. \n\nYes, it’s exactly what the Pulitzer Board was referring to. When Trump is sued, he is the president, and you cannot take the president away from his important duties with lawsuits. When Trump sues people, he is a private individual who also happens to be president, and has assessed whether he has the time to drag parties into endless litigation. \n\nIt’s a double standard that exists only for Trump, another way that he is above the law. Heads, Trump wins. Tails, we all lose.","summary":"Well before his oh-so-illustrious political career resulted in a truly breathtaking number of criminal charges, Donald Trump was no stranger to a courtroom.

As Republicans hail the legislation as a triumph of conservative governance, Democrats are mobilizing against what they describe as a broad assault on social safety nets. The measure, dubbed Trump’s Megabill, is poised to become a defining issue in the upcoming electoral contest.The $4.5 trillion legislative package, which includes permanent tax code changes, border security expansion, and controversial cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, has not only reshaped policy but also reignited fierce partisan debate — one that both parties believe could shape control of Congress next year.Also Read | From coverage to crisis? How Trump’s tax package could strip millions of Medicaid benefitsGOP Celebrates Legislative Victory as Fulfilling MandatePresident Trump showcased the bill’s passage at a rally in Iowa, declaring it the fulfillment of his 2024 campaign promises. “Every major promise I made to the people of Iowa in 2024 became a promise kept,” Trump told a cheering crowd.The Republican leadership, still navigating internal divisions, has largely coalesced around the megabill, viewing it as a major legislative win. It codifies Trump's earlier tax reforms and adds new measures such as tax exemptions on tips and a senior citizen tax deduction of $6,000 for those earning up to $75,000 annually.Live Events“This bill is not only about taxes — it's about showing voters we can deliver on our agenda,” said Mark Bednar, a Republican strategist and former aide to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. “The GOP should lean into this, especially as we approach the August recess and 2026 campaign cycle.”Also Read | 10 key takeaways from Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill summarised simplyDemocrats Highlight Social Cuts, Seek Messaging ResetDemocrats, reeling from setbacks in previous elections, see the bill as an opportunity to reframe the political conversation. Trump’s Megabill, they argue, prioritises wealthy Americans and corporations while slashing lifelines for vulnerable communities.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., delivered an impassioned nine-hour speech on the House floor, highlighting individuals affected by proposed Medicaid and SNAP reductions. “Shame on the people who've decided to launch that kind of all-out assault on the health and the well-being of everyday Americans,” he sai, as quoted in a report by ABC News.According to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, the bill will eliminate health coverage for 12 million Americans and strip 3 million of food stamp benefits over the next decade. The CBO also projected a $3.4 trillion increase in the national deficit as a result of the policy changes.Divided Public Opinion Clouds Political ImpactPolling data reflects the public’s ambivalence. A June Quinnipiac poll found that just 29% of voters supported the bill, while 55% opposed it. Another Fox News survey showed similar trends, with 59% against and only 38% in favour. Notably, nearly half of those polled felt the bill would negatively affect their own families.Opinions on work requirements for Medicaid recipients remain more evenly split: 47% support the provision, while 46% oppose it, as per a report by ABC News. Still, strategists on both sides believe the real electoral implications will depend on how effectively the parties communicate the bill’s provisions and consequences to voters. “It’s going to be crucial for Democrats to explain the long-term impact of Medicaid cuts and rising debt,” said Dan Sena, a Democratic strategist who ran the party’s 2018 congressional campaign.Echoes of 2018 or a New Political Terrain?Democrats have drawn parallels to 2018, when public backlash over GOP tax reforms and failed attempts to repeal Obamacare helped them reclaim the House. However, analysts caution that the 2026 midterms present a different landscape.At the time, Republicans were defending 25 districts won by Hillary Clinton. Today, just 13 Democrats hold seats in districts carried by Trump, while only three Republicans represent districts won by Vice President Kamala Harris.Moreover, some moderate Democrats have cautiously endorsed elements of Trump’s Megabill, including the no-tax-on-tips provision, complicating efforts to present a unified opposition.Republicans, meanwhile, are showing a more consolidated front under Trump’s leadership. While dissent did emerge — notably from Senator Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who opposed the Medicaid changes — such resistance remains isolated. After voting against the bill, Tillis announced he would not seek re-election, following reported pressure from Trump loyalists.Trump Signals Campaign Strategy for MidtermsPresident Trump made it clear during his Iowa rally that he intends to use the megabill as a campaign centrepiece. “With all of the things we did with the tax cuts and rebuilding our military, not one Democrat voted for us,\" he said. \"And I think we use it in the campaign that's coming up — the midterms, because we've got to beat them.\"FAQsWhat is Trump’s Megabill?Trump’s Megabill is a $4.5 trillion legislative package recently passed by the U.S. Congress. It includes permanent tax reforms, expanded border security, and significant cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs like SNAP.When do the Medicaid work requirements take effect?Starting in 2027, states must verify that “able-bodied” Medicaid recipients work at least 80 hours per month, unless exempted (e.g., students, caregivers, disabled individuals). Parents of children over 13 will also be subject to these checks.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTrump's Big Beautiful BillTrump's Megabill2026 midterm electionsMedicaid cuts effectsTrump's midterm\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

She’s trying to sound like she’s 26 years old, and it’s inappropriate. It feels weird. She’s one of our biggest stars, that’s true. Act like it… Have some class.”\n\nLater in the episode, Kelly implied that Theron may be misrepresenting her sexuality and exaggerating sexual encounters for attention.\n\n“I kind of call bulls–t, because I believe that Charlize Theron probably prefers women. That’s my belief. Okay, I’m entitled to my opinion, and there’s no reason to get into the details as to why I believe it, but I believe it,” Kelly said.\n\n“And I don’t think that she’s telling the truth about the 26-year-old.”\n\nTheron, who is currently promoting the upcoming Netflix film “The Old Guard 2,” told Cooper during their conversation: “I did just recently f–k a 26-year-old, and it was really amazing… I’ve never done that. And I was like, ‘Oh, this is great.’ Women should be the ones that are like, ‘F–k you, I’m going to have an orgasm.’”\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress has previously addressed questions about her sexuality.\n\nIn a 2017 appearance on the Bravo television show “Watch What Happens Live” with Andy Cohen, Theron was asked if she had “dipped in the lady pond.”\n\n“When I was young, yes,” Theron told Cohen. \n\nAt the time, she was promoting her film “Atomic Blonde,” a spy thriller in which she portrayed a bisexual MI6 agent who was operating in Berlin during the Cold War.\n\n“I mean, it’s just so not big deal. I’m so old school — I really like dudes,” Theron said at the time.\n\nTheron went on to clarify that while she explored her sexuality in the past, she identifies as heterosexual and has spoken out in support of bisexual visibility in film.\n\nKelly also criticized the actress’s use of profanity on “Call Her Daddy,” saying: “I love a good F bomb… But every sentence? An F bomb? ‘F in this, F in that, F in God,’ what is that? This is like an affectation where she’s trying to act like, again, young, cool girl, ‘I get it, and I don’t need a man.’”\n\nTheron, a single mother, also spoke on the podcast about the freedom she feels raising her two adopted daughters — Jackson and August — without a male partner.\n\n“She’s got two children. They don’t need a father? She’s super proud of the fact that there’s no father in the picture? Great. Good for you,” Kelly remarked.\n\n“It’s a very strange thing to see one of our best known actresses sit down like that, with the crossed legs, with this sex podcaster, talking about their orgasms and who they f’ed. It’s just really off-putting.”\n\nTheron adopted her eldest child, Jackson, in 2012, and her second daughter, August, in 2015. In 2019, Theron revealed that Jackson is transgender, telling media outlets that Jackson asserted her identity at age three.\n\nTheron, who has never married, has been candid about her dating life.\n\nShe was in a long-term relationship with actor Stuart Townsend from 2001 to 2010, and later dated Sean Penn between 2013 and 2015. She has been romantically linked to several others, including Alexander Skarsgård, Gabriel Aubry and Alex Dimitrijevic.\n\nThough she is reportedly on the celebrity dating app Raya, she has expressed frustration with the experience, calling it disingenuous and tiresome.\n\nReflecting on what she expects from relationships now, Theron told Cohen in a previous interview: “You better bring your A-game. I won’t settle for less than what I’m giving myself.”\n\nKelly closed her segment by contrasting Theron’s behavior with other stars she views as more tasteful.\n\n“You never see Julia Roberts do this kind of thing,” she said.\n\n“She’s on the opposite side of the aisle, that’s fine, but she doesn’t debase herself [or] her attention, because she’s a true star.”\n\nTheron and Cooper have not publicly responded to Kelly’s remarks.","summary":"Megyn Kelly launched a blistering critique of Charlize Theron, calling the actress “vulgar” and “off-putting” for revealing that she recently had a one-night stand with a 26-year-old man.

Wall Street ruajti fitimet e gjeneruara në javët e mëparshme dhe obligacionet nuk regjistruan lëvizje dramatike. Dollari vazhdon të dobësohet kundrejt monedhave të tjera, gjë që analistët e shoqërojnë me rritjen e deficitit dhe rreziqet fiskale të vetë paketës. Sipas vlerësimeve fillestare, paketa e Trump do t’i shtojë borxhit kombëtar një shumë marramendëse prej 3.3 trilionë dollarësh (po, trilionë!) gjatë dekadës së ardhshme. Ky është një informacion që në vetvete është një dhimbje koke për republikanët fiskalisht konservatorë, ata të llojit të vjetër, prandaj ndihmësit e administratës aktuale duhej të bënin një përpjekje të jashtëzakonshme, më të madhen deri më tani në mandatin e ri, për t’i vënë në vijë.

Zëvendëspresidenti JD Vance gjithashtu përveshi mëngët dhe filloi të ushtronte presion diskret, por të qartë mbi përfaqësuesit republikanë, me qëllim që ta bënte sa më të lehtë punën e Mike Johnson, Kryetarit të Dhomës së Përfaqësuesve. Vlerësimet për atë që po bën Trump tani janë tronditëse.\n\nÇdo dështim ose vonesë në miratimin e legjislacionit rrit pakënaqësinë midis republikanëve.

The story detailed Lyonne's efforts to lobby Hollywood heavyweights to sign onto her letter to the Trump administration in March, urging against the loosening of regulations around AI, which they deem a potential threat to their intellectual property without proper protections in place. The WSJ noted the White House's pending AI action plan \"could influence how U.S. copyright rules are applied to training large language models,\" with tech companies like Google and OpenAI saying they need such models to keep theirs up to date and compete globally with rivals like China. REPUBLICANS SCRAP DEAL IN 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' TO LOWER RESTRICTIONS ON STATES' AI REGULATIONS The Hollywood letter said the companies \"are arguing for a special government exemption so they can freely exploit America’s creative and knowledge industries, despite their substantial revenues and available funds. There is no reason to weaken or eliminate the copyright protections that have helped America flourish.\" Lyonne and more than 400 others, including such figures as Paul McCartney, Ron Howard and Ben Stiller, signed the letter. Lyonne, known for her roles in the series \"Poker Face\" and \"Russian Doll,\" is a partner in a new studio called Asteria, which describes itself as \"an artist-led generative AI film and animation studio powered by the first clean and ethical AI model.\" Like many figures in Hollywood, Lyonne is not a fan of the president, endorsing Kamala Harris in 2024 and posting in a now-deleted X post in 2020 about turning Texas blue to defeat Trump. Earlier this year, she told The Hollywood Reporter she was concerned for marginalized communities, saying of Trump, \"It’s very weird to have like a showbiz guy in charge, is surreal. I’m actually pretty horrified by how strategic and effective this whole thing has been.\" FEDERAL AI POWER GRAB COULD END STATE PROTECTIONS FOR KIDS AND WORKERS She added she was concerned that 12-year-olds wouldn't be able to get abortions, later clarifying that she was referring to young victims of rape or incest who may be forced to give birth. The WSJ reported that Trump officials were unsure whether they'd take any action on the AI front, due to the complexities involved and having to take one side over another. There have been mixed rulings on the subject as well, with fair use arguments favoring companies like Meta and Anthropic in two cases last month because the copyrighted material used to train their AI models was sufficiently transformed, the Wall Street Journal reported. But others have favored copyright holders, depending on the context. OpenAI and Google put forth their own submissions earlier this year to the White House Office of Science and Technology asking their respective companies to be able to train their models on copyrighted material. \"The federal government can both secure Americans’ freedom to learn from AI and avoid forfeiting our AI lead to the PRC [People's Republic of China] by preserving American AI models’ ability to learn from copyrighted material,\" OpenAI’s letter states. SCARLETT JOHANSSON TAKES AIM AT COMPANIES USING HER LIKENESS, VOICE IN AI Google’s letter states, \"Balanced copyright rules, such as fair use and text-and-data mining exceptions, have been critical to enabling AI systems to learn from prior knowledge and publicly available data, unlocking scientific and social advances. These exceptions allow for the use of copyrighted, publicly available material for AI training without significantly impacting rightsholders and avoid often highly unpredictable, imbalanced, and lengthy negotiations with data holders during model development or scientific experimentation.\" This week, a deal that had been reached between Sens. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, over how states can regulate artificial intelligence was pulled from President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful\" bill. The collapsed agreement would have required states seeking to access hundreds of millions of dollars in AI infrastructure funding in the \"big, beautiful\" bill to refrain from adopting new regulations on the technology for five years, a compromise down from the original 10 years. The White House didn't respond to a request for comment. Fox News Digital also reached out to Lyonne's representatives, as well as Google and OpenAI, for comment.

Proponents of a Beshear run point to his electoral success in Kentucky, a reliably Republican state, as proof he can win over Republican and independent voters. However, polls suggest he is less known than other Democrats who could run in 2028.What to KnowBeshear, who was speculated to be a potential vice presidential candidate for Kamala Harris' presidential campaign, addressed speculation about a potential run in an interview with Vanity Fair published Friday.\"Two years ago, I wouldn't have considered [running for president],\" he told the magazine. \"But if I'm somebody who could maybe heal and bring the country back together, I'll think about it after next year.\"Early polls suggest most Democrats favor candidates like former Vice President Kamala Harris, California Governor Gavin Newsom or former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. But the primary still years away, meaning a dark horse candidate like Beshear could still break through.The latest Emerson College poll showed Beshear with support from 2 percent of respondents.In that poll, 16 percent of respondents backed Buttigieg, 13 percent supported Harris and 12 percent leaned toward Newsom. Seven percent supported both Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, while 5 percent said they would prefer to vote for Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Three percent backed New Jersey Senator Cory Booker and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Maryland Governor Wes Moore also received the backing of 2 percent of respondents.The poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from June 24 to June 25 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.A Morning Consult poll from June found him similarly trailing other candidates with 1 percent support.That poll showed Harris leading with 36 percent of the vote. Buttigieg followed at 10 percent, and 5 percent backed Newsom and Ocasio-Cortez. It polled 1,000 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents from June 13 to June 15, 2025.Beshear remains one of the most popular governors in the country. A Morning Consult survey found that he has a net approval rating of +43. Sixty-eight percent view him favorably, while only 25 percent give him negative marks.Supporters say that approval is especially impressive given President Donald Trump's 30-point victory in Kentucky. He won nearly 65 percent of the vote, compared to former Vice President Kamla Harris' 34 percent, in the 2024 election.What People Are SayingBeshear told Kentucky's WDRB in May: \"But I don't want to leave a broken country to my kids. So, if I'm somebody who can bring this nation together, hopefully find some common ground, it's something I would consider.\"Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, said in June in remarks to WHAS: \"If he wants to run, he should. He's a great guy. He's a wonderful governor. I've known him a long time.\"What Happens NextCandidates typically don't start making formal presidential runs until after the midterms, but other potential candidates are already laying the groundwork for 2028.

According to multiple news outlets, Donald Trump told a Des Moines crowd, “We’re going to have a UFC fight—think of this—on the grounds of the White House.” That initialism is a reference to the Ultimate Fighting Championship, a MMA promotions company now owned by talent-agency-turned-combat-sports conglomerate Endeavor, a public company led by big-ticket Democrat donor and vocal Kamala Harris supporter Ari Emanuel.\nOf course, Emanuel isn’t who most folks think of, if or when they mull the UFC. That honor goes to Dana White, a longtime Trump hype man employed by the fight company as president and CEO (he also reportedly holds a small ownership stake). White, who was caught on tape in an alleged domestic violence incident with wife Anne White in 2022, has praised Trump as “the toughest, most resilient guy I’ve ever met in my life” and “the legitimate, ultimate American badass of all time,” words that cynics might assume have swayed Trump’s interest in his company.\nIf the White House match happens, it will be an incredible turnaround for a sport that was banned in most states until just a couple of decades ago. The UFC—which once marketed itself as “no holds barred,” although rules do indeed exist today—faced bipartisan ire when Republican Senator John McCain sent letters to governors of all 50 states in 1996 encouraging its ban. It was “barbaric,” “not a sport,” and “human cockfighting,” McCain wrote. In consequence, the UFC went dark in the US until the turn of the millennium, when those laws were lifted state by state.\nThe now-shuttered Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City was the site of a UFC bout soon after, in 2001, so if this White House match goes off, it won’t be the president’s first time hosting one of the company’s events. “We’re going to have some incredible events, some professional events, some amateur events. But the UFC fight is going to be a big deal, too,” Trump told assembled Iowans Thursday. “It’s going to be a championship fight, full fight, like 20,000 to 25,000 people and we’re going to do that as part of ‘250’ also.”\nAccording to a pool report quoting White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, the president is “dead serious” about the plan to host this globally inspired sporting event at the White House, even as more expressly and traditionally American pursuits like baseball (the modern version of which was invented in New York in the 1840s), basketball (Massachusetts, 1890s), and American football (East Coast, 1960s) go unmentioned.\nIt’s news sure to rile former Trump supporters like Tucker Carlson, who has recently complained that Trump’s promise to focus on American excellence and boosterism appears to be slipping. \"Let’s focus on my country, where I was born,” Carlson said last month, as he chewed over America’s bombing of Iran. Is Trump’s desire to mark America’s founding with a new, non-traditional, and foreign-born sport a yet another sign—like his softened stance on undocumented farmworkers—that the president is sneakily, incrementally going multicultural and woke? If so, this is certainly a July 4 for the history books.","summary":"The president passes over American pastimes like baseball, basketball, and football for the foreign-born discipline of mixed martial arts.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/donald-trump-white-house-ufc-match","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6867f16ef69d8cc9437f833a/16:9/w_6848,h_3852,c_limit/2209982489","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-04 17:46:16","author":"Eve Batey","authors":["Eve Batey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.128},{"id":338365092,"title":"How Paramount's $16-million Trump settlement came together  — and could've fallen apart","text":"By early spring, Paramount Global was in crisis. President Trump wouldn’t budge from his demand for an eye-popping sum of money and an apology from the company to settle his lawsuit over a CBS News “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. Journalists at the storied broadcaster were in revolt against the parent company. Meanwhile, Paramount’s board faced withering pressure, with a settlement widely seen as a prerequisite for getting government approval for the company’s $8-billion sale to David Ellison’s Skydance Media, or the deal would collapse. Then a new emergency erupted. On May 4, CBS aired a hard-hitting “60 Minutes” segment that took aim at Trump’s targeting of law firms. Correspondent Scott Pelley anchored the report, which relied heavily on an interview with a leading Trump irritant — former top Hillary Clinton advisor Marc Elias. Trump was furious. He threatened Paramount with an additional lawsuit alleging defamation, according to people close to the situation who were not authorized to comment. The behind-the-scenes drama eventually would culminate with Paramount agreeing to pay $16 million to end the president’s battle over edits to October’s Harris interview, which Trump alleged was manipulated to boost the then-vice president’s election chances. Trump’s suit had demanded $20 billion in damages. The deal resulted from months of back-and-forth among a constellation of power players with competing interests: the president, mogul Shari Redstone, tech billionaire Larry Ellison and his son David, Hollywood super agent Ari Emanuel, CBS News' ousted leader Wendy McMahon and Jeff Shell, a former NBCUniversal chief now with RedBird Capital Partners, which backs Ellison's Skydance. The settlement, which the president approved late Tuesday, included a commitment by Trump to drop his claims and not sue over the May \"60 Minutes\" broadcast, according to sources and a Paramount statement. Paramount said it agreed to pay Trump's legal fees. The remainder of the $16-million settlement will go toward his future presidential library. \"Larry Ellison is a friend of mine. He's a great guy,\" Trump told reporters following a Thursday night rally in Iowa. \"I think he's going to run CBS really well, and I think he's making a good deal to buy it.\" The beleaguered company behind \"Mission: Impossible\" and \"Yellowstone\" mustered victories during the negotiations, withstanding the Trump team's earlier demand for a $100-million payout, the knowledgeable sources said. The company also refused to apologize for CBS' reporting or edits, a stance to protect its journalistic ethics and 1st Amendment rights. \"This settlement allows Paramount to focus on its prospective sale, and CBS can maintain its principles,\" said C. Kerry Fields, a business law professor at the USC Marshall School. \"But principle has its price, and there certainly was one set here.\" The eight-month skirmish with Trump shined a harsh light on Paramount's vulnerabilities — and deep divisions within the company and its prospective new owners. Paramount had a narrow window to reach a truce. The company wanted to finalize the settlement before Wednesday, when Paramount held its annual shareholder meeting and three new members joined the board. \"This [settlement] was all about survival — it was that dark,\" Fields said. \"Paramount has to execute the sale to Skydance in order to survive.\" At first, Paramount's sale to the Ellison family seemed like a sure bet. Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle Corp., is close to Trump and his company is a possible buyer for TikTok, another deal of interest to the president. The landmark Paramount-Skydance deal, struck a year ago, could reshape one of Hollywood's original studios and the entertainment landscape. Redstone and her family agreed to part with their entertainment holdings, National Amusements Inc., and controlling Paramount shares. The family's shaky finances were a catalyst for the sale. Redstone has borrowed heavily to meet debt obligations, including a $186-million term loan from Larry Ellison last year. The family is waiting for the cash from the sale of Paramount and National Amusements to the Ellisons and RedBird, a private equity firm. But an unexpected misstep altered the deal's course. Last fall, \"60 Minutes\" invited Trump and Harris to participate in preelection interviews. Trump agreed, then backed out. CBS News went forward with a Harris sit-down. Correspondent Bill Whitaker asked Harris about the Biden administration's rocky relations with Israel's prime minister. Producers used different portions of her answer on two programs: a convoluted response on CBS' Sunday morning show \"Face the Nation,\" and a more succinct part on \"60 Minutes.\" Trump and his supporters zeroed in on the discrepancy. They accused CBS of doctoring the interview. CBS News denied the allegation, saying the edits were routine. Days before the election, Trump sued in Amarillo, Texas, ensuring the case would be overseen by a Trump-appointed judge. His lawsuit alleged the \"60 Minutes\" edits amounted to election interference — \"malicious, deceptive, and substantial news distortion calculated to confuse, deceive, and mislead the public,\" in the suit's words. 1st Amendment experts said the case had no merit; some figured it was a campaign stunt. Days later, Shell, the RedBird executive who will become Paramount's president should Skydance take over, held a conference call with top CBS executives. Shell suggested \"60 Minutes\" release the full Harris interview transcript in a bid for transparency, according to people familiar with the matter. News executives refused, drawing a clear division between some high-level Paramount executives and Ellison's team. Those Paramount executives have bristled over Shell's involvement, including a comment he reportedly made to McMahon late last year, stating the company eventually would have to settle. Skydance has said it has an agreement with Paramount that gives Ellison and Shell the ability to give input on key business issues — even before acquiring Paramount. A spokesperson for Shell declined to comment. The role of Shell, ousted from his previous role running NBCUniversal after acknowledging an inappropriate relationship with an underling, has been controversial. Representatives for the creators of \"South Park\" have accused him of overstepping his authority and meddling with a protracted negotiation over their overall deal and streaming rights to the long-running cartoon. A representative for Shell denied that accusation. Trump had scored previous victories over media organizations. In December, the Walt Disney Co. agreed to pay him $16 million, including $1 million for his attorney fees, to end a dispute stemming from ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos' inaccurate description of Trump's liability in a civil court case. Press advocates howled. Paramount held firm. But it failed to get Trump's case dismissed or moved to a court in New York, where CBS and \"60 Minutes\" are based. So the company was in a box. Its sale to Skydance requires the approval of the Federal Communications Commission to transfer CBS TV station licenses to the Ellisons, and that consent has been elusive. In one of his first moves as FCC chairman, Trump appointee Brendan Carr launched an inquiry into whether CBS' edits of the Harris interview rose to the level of news distortion — the crux of Trump's lawsuit. In February, Carr demanded CBS release a raw transcript of the Harris interview and the unedited footage. CBS complied; the material showed Harris had been accurately quoted. The Texas judge ordered Paramount and Trump's lawyers into mediation. Talks began April 30. That weekend, \"60 Minutes\" ran its report on Trump and the law firms, riling Redstone and others. The Trump team and Paramount were already far apart, the sources said. Soon, CBS News and Stations President Wendy McMahon was forced out. Knowledgeable sources attributed her departure to months of strife and persistent criticism from Redstone, who serves as Paramount's chair. McMahon also made missteps, including overseeing an unsuccessful reboot of \"CBS Evening News.\" Her exit followed that of Bill Owens, the longtime executive producer of \"60 Minutes,\" who fought efforts to settle. The day McMahon was ousted, left-leaning U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) lobbed a salvo at Redstone. In a May 19 letter, they warned that Paramount board members risked possible bribery charges if they paid Trump to settle the lawsuit as a way to win FCC approval for the Skydance deal. By early June, Redstone and the Ellison team were getting restless. Emanuel, the agent, stepped in to help get the dealmaking back on track, people familiar with the matter said. Emanuel is Trump's former talent agent and one of Ellison's closest allies. On June 7, Ellison met briefly with Trump at a UFC event in New Jersey. Emanuel is executive chairman of the WME Group and chief executive of UFC’s parent company, TKO. According to a source, Emanuel associate Dana White, the Trump-supporting UFC chief executive, helped facilitate the Ellison meeting with the president, which occurred steps away from the fighters' octagon. People close to Ellison and Emanuel declined to discuss Ellison's interactions with the president. Representatives of Skydance, Redstone and Emanuel declined to comment for this story. Finally, a breakthrough came when Trump offered support for Ellison and the Skydance deal, though he continued to blast Harris and CBS News. “Ellison is great,” Trump said from the White House lawn on June 18. \"He'll do a great job with it.\" Late Thursday, Trump called David Ellison \"a fantastic young man.\" Meanwhile, the clock was ticking. Redstone and others wanted the board to handle the settlement before the shareholder meeting, when one director stepped down, and three new members joined the board. Redstone recused herself from voting but made her wishes known. The settlement was finally reached about 10 hours before the Paramount board switched. One person close to the legal effort said the agreement \"got over the finish line\" due to a sweetener for Trump. His team anticipates that Paramount networks eventually will run millions of dollars worth of free commercials, or public service announcements, in support of Trump causes, including combating antisemitism and increasing border security. Trump also referenced the alleged side deal. \"We did a deal for about $16 million plus $16 million — or maybe more than that in advertising,\" Trump said. \"So [the settlement] is like $32- to maybe $35 million.\" Paramount said it agreed to a $16-million settlement. . “Paramount’s settlement with President Trump does not include PSAs,\" the company said in a statement. \"Paramount has no knowledge of any promises or commitments made to President Trump other than those set forth in the settlement proposed by the mediator and accepted by the parties.\" Skydance declined to comment. Emanuel did not respond to messages. The settlement does contain another provision championed by Trump.\"60 Minutes\" will release transcripts of interviews with eligible U.S. presidential candidates after those interviews air, \"subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns,” Paramount said. 1st Amendment advocates were disheartened by the deal. So were Trump's enemies, including the senators who had vowed to investigate the deal for bribery. Paramount's move to \"settle a bogus lawsuit with President Trump over a \"60 Minutes\" report he did not like is an extremely dangerous precedent,\" Sanders, the U.S. senator, said in a statement. \"Paramount’s decision will only embolden Trump to continue attacking, suing and intimidating the media.\"","summary":"The high-stakes deal that came together this week resulted from months of back-and-forth among a constellation of power players with competing interests, including the president, the Larry Ellison family and mogul Shari Redstone.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-07-04/paramount-trump-60-minutes-settlement-how-deal-got-done","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fe57db8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x1890+0+101/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F33%2F36%2Ff14cee5042da875fbaa8dc0fb20a%2F1457497-et-paramount","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-04 17:17:00","author":"Meg James","authors":["Meg James"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.215},{"id":338326890,"title":"Trump-voting Nebraska county loses sole clinic to president’s 'anticipated federal budget cuts'","text":"A clinic in Republican southwest Nebraska announced it’s closure this week due to anticipated Medicaid cuts from President Donald Trump’s new budget — approved by its own Republican lawmakers.\n\nAfter more than 30 years of service, McCook-based Community Hospital said it's shutting down its small-town clinic in Curtis due to financial challenges and GOP assault on Medicaid payments.\n\n“Unfortunately, the current financial environment, driven by anticipated federal budget cuts to Medicaid, has made it impossible for us to continue operating all of our services, many of which have faced significant financial challenges for years,” Community Hospital CEO Troy Bruntz told KLKN-TV, adding the clinic will wind down services over the next few months.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Dangerous and outrageous': Veterans erupt at Trump after he sends 200 Marines to Florida \n\nCurtis Medical Center was Frontier County’s only healthcare facility.

And I blow away the reckless government spending on my DOGE subcommittee.”\n\nShe also took aim at former President Joe Biden, accusing Democrats of giving away “trillions to illegal aliens, the green new scam, and their NGO deep-state friends to destroy our country.”\n\n“But America elected Donald Trump,” she continued, “and now I’m working by his side to make America great again, and we are fighting to protect our faith, families, and freedom.”\n\nHer final sales pitch was delivered with another burst of gunfire: “Why enter to win this gun? Because in America, you can.”\n\nThe giveaway website echoes that nationalistic theme, promising “one lucky winner” the FN M249S PARA to celebrate the nation’s 250th birthday, which is … next year. \n\nGreene’s giveaway gun is a semiautomatic replica of the M249 SAW used by military and law enforcement, according to FN America, the manufacturer.

Greene’s announcement drops just as her party faces backlash for rushing the passage of Trump’s cruel tax legislation.\n\nThat said, a high-dollar gun raffle over the long weekend is one way to shift the focus away from public policy and back to Greene’s preferred domain: tacky stunts.","summary":"Looking for something to do this Fourth of July?

Newsom has cast himself as a leading rival to President Donald Trump amid his second term in office. Several prominent Democrats are expected to jump into the race. While the primary is still more than two years away, potential candidates are already making early moves with the goal of giving themselves an advantage among Democratic primary voters.What to KnowThe South Carolina Democratic Party (SCDP) announced a multi-county tour with Newsom across some of the most \"economically challenged and environmentally vulnerable rural counties in South Carolina\" next week.Several of these counties have experienced \"hardship\" from job loss, wildfires and hurricanes, the SCDP wrote in a statement, adding that the rural areas have been \"left behind\" by Republican leaders in the state.It will also give Newsom the opportunity to engage with voters in what is likely to be an early-voting state.South Carolina voted first in the 2024 primary but has long been among the four first states to vote—along with Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire. Whether the schedule may change remains unclear at this point.The statement, however, makes no mention of his potential 2028 ambitions.SCDP Chair Christale Spain wrote in a statement that Newsom \"leads the largest economy in America and the fourth largest in the world\" and is \"coming to meet folks in towns that have been hollowed out by decades of Republican control.\"\"This is about building partnerships, uplifting communities, and showing rural voters they aren't forgotten,\" Spain wrote.Gavin Newsom's Chance of Winning 2028 Primary—PollsNewsom has been among the leading candidates in most polls of the 2028 primary, along with former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.The latest Morning Consult poll of the potential 2028 field showed that Newsom's standing doubled after the Los Angeles protests over Trump's immigration policies and mass deportations. Eleven percent said they planned to support him, up from 5 percent in March. Still, 34 percent said they leaned toward Harris. Seven percent said they planned to vote for Buttigieg and Ocasio-Cortez.The poll surveyed 1,000 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents from June 13 to June 15, 2025.An Emerson College poll last month showed Newsom with 12 percent support, compared to 16 percent for Buttigieg, 13 percent for Harris and 7 percent for Ocasio-Cortez.The poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from June 24 to June 25, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.What People Are SayingSpain wrote in the press release: \"Our strategy isn't about chasing cable news coverage, it's about showing up and building trust, town by town, county by county, that is our path back to power.

Trump previously sued the company after an episode of 60 Minutes in which he claimed his then-presidential rival, Kamala Harris, was edited in a way to make her look better during the election.\n\nWhile many legal experts agreed Trump’s claims were baseless, the suit was taken seriously due in part to Paramount Global’s proposed merger with Skydance Media, which requires government approval.\n\nHowever, on Thursday night, July 3, Trump claimed the settlement was more than the stated $16 million. Speaking with reporters in a motorcade back to the White House following a rally in Iowa, the President said, per the The Washington Post, “We did a deal for about $16 million plus $16 million, or maybe more than that in advertising. So it’s a combination of 16 plus 16. So it’s like $32 [million]. Maybe $35 million.”\n\nTrump’s claims follow reports that Skydance Media CEO David Ellison has promised the President free advertising time on Paramount’s networks once the merger is finalized. On July 2, the New York Post cited an anonymous source claiming Ellison and Trump had reached a “side deal,” including PSAs and “other broadcast transmissions” valued between $15 million and $20 million.\n\nParamount Global has denied this, saying in a July 2 statement, “Contrary to some news reports or media speculation, Paramount’s settlement with President Trump does not include PSAs or anything related to PSAs.

Since she released Invasion of Privacy seven years ago, they have continued to support every tune she has shared – and there have been quite a lot of them.\n\nThe Grammy winner recently dropped the brand new single \"Outside\" and finally announced that her second full-length effort, Am I the Drama?, is coming in September. All the excitement around not just a just-shared cut, but also a forthcoming album has helped \"Outside\" become a powerful seller and streamer, bringing Cardi back to No. 1 on multiple U.S.-based charts this week.\n\n“Outside” Debuts at No. 1 on Five Charts\n\nIn America, the star rules five Billboard tallies as \"Outside\" opens in first place on rankings dedicated to both pure purchases and streaming activity, as interest in the tune was incredibly high from the moment it arrived. \"Outside\" leads the Digital Song Sales, R&B/Hip-Hop Digital Song Sales, and Rap Digital Song Sales charts, as well as both the R&B/Hip-Hop Streaming Songs and Rap Streaming Songs tallies.\n\nCardi’ B’s History of Hitting No. 1\n\nCardi has already reached No. 1 on all of these lists in the past – multiple times, in fact – though the number of leaders she has accrued differs widely from one ranking to the next. She has earned half a dozen rulers on the streaming tallies, eight No. 1s on the all-genre Digital Song Sales chart, 13 No. 1s on the Rap Digital Song Sales ranking, and 16 smashes on the R&B/Hip-Hop Digital Song Sales roster.\n\nThe Bestselling Song in America\n\nLuminate reports that in its first tracking frame, \"Outside\" sold a little more than 13,600 copies.

And they have argued that work requirements, if implemented properly, would weed out abuse in safety net programs.\n\nAccording to a June poll from Quinnipiac University, 29% of voters supported the bill, while 55% opposed it.\n\nThe same poll showed that registered voters were evenly split on the issue of work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients without dependents: 47% in favor of the new requirements, and 46% opposed.\n\nA mid-June Fox News poll found similar results: 59% of registered voters said they oppose the bill, while 38% of them favored it.\n\nAbout half of voters in that poll thought the bill would hurt them and their families, while 40% said they did not understand the bill very much, or at all.\n\nSome Democratic leaders and officials believe the combination of tax cuts and potential changes to some Americans' health care coverage could allow the party to recapture the anger and anti-Trump backlash that helped the party reclaim the House in 2018, after Republicans passed their tax package and repeatedly failed to repeal Obamacare.\n\n\"It's going to be very important for the Democrats to define, for the electorate and for voters, exactly who's most impacted by these Medicaid cuts, and in particular, what the longer term impacts of all the debt are actually going to be,\" said Dan Sena, a Democratic strategist who oversaw the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2018.\n\nBut the midterms may not be exact parallels.\n\nHeading into 2018, Republicans were defending 25 districts that voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nToday, 13 Democrats represent districts carried by Trump last year, while just three Republicans represent districts won by former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nEight years ago, Democrats largely opposed Trump's legislative agenda.

Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who slammed the bill's Medicaid provisions, and its potential impact on his home state.\n\nHis comments led to criticism -- and the threat of a primary challenge - from Trump.\n\nWhen the dust settled, Tillis voted against the bill in the Senate, but also announced he would not run for re-election.\n\nSpeaking at the Iowa rally on Thursday, Trump suggested Republicans can use the megabill to their advantage in the midterms.\n\n“With all of the things we did with the tax cuts and rebuilding our military, not one Democrat voted for us,\" Trump said. \"And I think we use it in the campaign that's coming up -- the midterms, because we've got to beat them.\"","summary":"Republicans see a lot to celebrate, but Democrats are hoping to build momentum leading into the 2026 midterms.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/selling-megabill-republicans-tout-taxes-democrats-point-medicaid/story?id=123468529","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/ccb0af17-9e6c-4ea2-a82c-6edd0f49b04d/trump-8-ap-er-250703_1751578102522_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-04 13:51:50","author":"Benjamin Siegel","authors":["Benjamin Siegel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.059},{"id":338295386,"title":"DNC revamps messaging, says Trump is 'killing the American dream' through price hikes, 'big beautiful bill'","text":"FIRST ON FOX — The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Friday launched a new campaign accusing President Donald Trump of \"killing the American dream\"through price hikes, market volatility and the GOP-backed megabill passed by Congress. Party officials plan to lean heavily on the message in the months ahead as they work to broaden their appeal and regain momentum ahead of the 2026 midterms. The DNC's messaging campaign, previewed exclusively to Fox News Digital, seeks to tie Trump directly to recent price hikes on consumer goods, such as groceries and baby food, as well as cost of living increases and insurance costs, which they argue will soar under the so-called \"big beautiful bill.\" \"America should be the land of opportunity but under Donald Trump, the American dream is dying,\" they said Friday in an email previewed by Fox News. The campaign will feature new memos and ads under the broader mantle of the \"Trump killing the American dream\" campaign, which is slated to run through December. JUDGES V TRUMP: HERE ARE THE KEY COURT BATTLES HALTING THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA The initiative is part of the DNC’s broader upheaval of its messaging in the wake of the 2024 elections, which saw longtime Democrat voting blocs, including some minority voters and young people, shift towards Trump and the Republican Party. This includes Hispanic voters, whose support for Trump nearly broke even with former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, according to exit poll data, as well as larger shares of registered Independent voters and young voters. The new messaging strategy unveiled Friday focuses largely on what Democrats argue is the daylight between Trump's campaign trail promises, contrasting his pledge to return America to a \"golden age,\" with the situation for many working-class Americans. TRUMP'S ULTIMATUM TO FEDERAL WORKERS: RETURN TO OFFICE 'OR BE TERMINATED' It highlights expected cuts to Medicaid, food assistance programs and other community-based housing affordability programs that stand to be reduced, if not altogether eliminated, by the Republican spending bill. \"After ramming Trump's [budget bill] through Congress, one thing is abundantly clear: Republicans own this mess, and it's an albatross around their necks heading into the midterms,\" DNC Chair Ken Martin told Fox News Digital. \"This is the least popular legislation in modern history, and the more voters learn about it the more they hate it. That's a clear directive for Democrats — we're going to make sure every single voter knows who is responsible for taking away their healthcare, food, hospitals, and nursing homes.\" That message is expected to be a central Democratic theme through 2026. Party officials say they’re now better positioned to make their case to voters — and that the American people, in return, are more willing to listen to them. The launch comes on the heels of the party’s \"Organizing Summer\" campaign, aimed at boosting Democratic operations in battleground states. The DNC has ramped up state-level funding, voter registration and volunteer recruitment — drawing more than 15,000 volunteers to date. Officials say they will continue to hammer their message hard in the run-up to 2026, including in 35 Republican-held congressional seats the Democratic Party's House campaign arm has identified as \"districts in play\" in the 2026 election cycle, or areas where they could find a path to winning back the House majority. Friday’s launch is not the first time the DNC has tried to tie Trump to economic pain — but past efforts have had limited success. It remains unclear whether this latest push will resonate with Independents and Republicans, who delivered sweeping victories for Trump and the GOP in 2024, especially as the economy shows signs of resilience. Just Thursday, the Labor Department reported the U.S. added 147,000 jobs in June — blowing past expectations — while unemployment ticked down to 4.1%. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP However, DNC officials insist the economic situation has changed as a result of tariff threats, volatility and unpopular legislation they see as a new opportunity to break through to voters who may have been less receptive in previous elections. They point to a Congressional Budget Office analysis which estimates the spending bill backed by Trump will increase federal deficits by roughly $2.4 trillion over 10 years and have a knock-down impact on working-class Americans, who could see a spike in insurance costs, housing prices, and cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and education programs, including Pell grants. They also cite projections that the bill could eliminate 1.2 million jobs by 2029. \"Let’s be clear: The Trump administration has taken aim at the very things that make America the greatest country in the world,\" party officials said. \"Americans are overwhelmingly rejecting his agenda, rife with buyers' remorse. Democrats are standing with the American people, organizing everywhere, and fighting back — in Congress, in the courts, and on the ground in states across the country.\" Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House and Republican National Committee for comment.","summary":"Democrats unveil new messaging campaign tying President Donald Trump to economic challenges and Republican spending bill, targeting battleground districts to win back voters.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dnc-says-trump-killing-american-dream-through-price-hikes-spending-bill","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/931/523/gettyimages-2167488300-scaled.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-04 13:44:10","author":"Breanne Deppisch","authors":["Breanne Deppisch"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":338244982,"title":"'Freedoms get trampled': Trump’s ruthless media shakedowns are only becoming worse","text":"Many experts on media law attacked President Donald Trump's $20 billion lawsuit against CBS News as frivolous and devoid of merit.

According to Pew Research Center, about 66 percent of Hispanic voters supported Barack Obama in 2012, and 65 percent supported Hillary Clinton in 2016. In 2020, 63 percent of Hispanic voters supported Joe Biden, according to AP VoteCast.In 2024, Democrats saw their lead among the group cut substantially, with 55 percent supporting Kamala Harris and 43 percent supporting Trump—an 8-point increase from 2020 and the highest percentage for a Republican presidential candidate since such data has been tracked.The recent YouGov/Yahoo poll shows that Trump maintains his support among Hispanic voters.What To KnowTrump's gains with Hispanic voters stand in sharp contrast to his slipping support among other key demographic groups. Across most other segments, the president's approval ratings fell in June.The most striking drop was among Black voters, where his net approval plunged from -49 points to -70. Among Gen Z voters, his net rating also deteriorated sharply, falling from -23 points in May to -41 points in June.These trends reflect national polling that shows Trump's overall approval rating hitting an all-time low for his second term.The latest ActiVote survey, conducted June 1 to 30 among 523 adults, found Trump's national approval at 45 percent and disapproval at 52 percent—putting his net approval at -7 points, his worst showing since returning to office.Despite this record low for his second term, Trump's current approval still outpaces his own first-term average, which ActiVote tracked at 41 percent. It also remains slightly higher than former President Joe Biden's full-term average of 41 percent and Biden's final-year average of 40 percent.A separate survey by Targoz Market Research and Overton Insights, conducted June 23 to 26 among 1,200 registered voters, put Trump's net approval even deeper underwater at -11 points—with 43 percent approving and 54 percent disapproving. That's a noticeable drop from a -5 net approval rating in March.Meanwhile, in the YouGov/Yahoo poll, Trump's net approval dropped from -13 points in May—when 41 percent approved and 54 percent disapproved—to -16 points, with 40 percent approving and 56 percent disapproving.A few outliers offer Trump a silver lining. An RMG Research poll from June 18 to 26 showed the president still slightly above water, with a net approval of +4 points (51 percent approve, 47 percent disapprove)—though that, too, was down from +7 previously.Some polls also suggest Trump's approval rating has ticked up slightly after a period of steady decline, underscoring how divided—and volatile—voter sentiment is in his second term.Newsweek's tracker puts Trump's approval at 45 percent, with 51 percent disapproving, giving him a net approval of -6 points. That marks an improvement from the end of last week, when his net approval rating sank to an all-time low of -10 points.The latest Navigator Research poll, conducted June 26 to 30, found Trump at 45 percent approval and 53 percent disapproval—a slight recovery from early June, when he hit a record low for this term at 43 percent approval and 55 percent disapproval. A YouGov/Economist survey from June 27 to 30 showed a modest uptick to 42 percent approval and 53 percent disapproval, up from a low of 40 percent earlier in the month.\n\nJune 30-July 2\n\nYouGov/Yahoo\n\nNavigator Research\n\nYouGov/Economist\n\nMorning Consult\n\nRMG Research\n\nThe Tyson Group\n\nSimilarly, Morning Consult's June 27 to 29 poll found 47 percent of respondents approved of Trump's job performance, with 50 percent disapproving—a slight improvement from May's 45 percent approval and 53 percent disapproval.A Marist/NPR/PBS poll conducted June 23 to 25 put Trump's approval at 43 percent and disapproval at 52 percent, a tick up from April's low of 42 percent approval and 53 percent disapproval.Meanwhile, the latest Quantus Insights poll, conducted June 30 to July 2 among 1,000 registered voters, showed Trump's net approval at -2 points, with 47 percent approving and 49 percent disapproving—relatively unchanged from previous Quantus polls.What Happens NextTrump's approval ratings are likely to fluctuate in the coming weeks.","summary":"A YouGov/Yahoo poll shows Trump's net approval rating among Hispanic voters at -30 points, up 7 points from the previous month.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-approval-rating-update-polls-hispanics-2094652","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2677027/trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-04 12:13:22","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.276},{"id":338227912,"title":"Why Indian-origin Zohran Mamdani also identified as African-American in his Columbia University college application - where he did not get through","text":"In America, race is not just a description of skin colour. It is a narrative slot, a ticket to visibility, legitimacy, or silent exclusion. For Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, the choice he made on his Columbia University application in 2009 now sits unearthed and scrutinised: he ticked the boxes for both “Asian” and “Black or African American.”Born in Uganda to Indian parents, Mamdani does not identify as Black. When asked this week why he selected those categories, he said: “Most college applications don’t have a box for Indian-Ugandans, so I checked multiple boxes trying to capture the fullness of my background.”On the surface, it sounds like an act of calculated advantage-seeking. After all, Columbia, like most elite universities then, ran race-conscious admissions. Identifying as Black might have increased his chances in a system designed to redress centuries of racial exclusion. Critics, including Mayor Eric Adams, quickly pounced, calling it “an insult to every student who got into college the right way.”But the reality is more layered—and reveals how rigid, colonial-era categories continue to shape lives in ways that rarely match lived complexity.Indian but not Indian-AmericanMamdani is ethnically Indian, born to a Gujarati family whose ancestors migrated to East Africa over a century ago. His mother, Mira Nair, is a globally acclaimed filmmaker. His father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a leading postcolonial scholar. But in East Africa, Indians were neither fully African nor entirely Indian in identity. Under British colonialism, they were categorised as “Asiatics” and kept apart from both white settlers and native Africans. In Uganda, many thrived in trade and professions but remained perpetual outsiders—a status violently reinforced by Idi Amin’s 1972 expulsion of Asians.For Indian-Ugandans like Mamdani, identity has always been ambiguous: African by birth, Indian by ethnicity, but citizens of neither. When his family moved to New York in 1999, American forms forced a new set of boxes upon him. The Asian tick-box includes Indians, but rarely captures the distinct history of Indians in Africa. The African American box, meanwhile, is designed for descendants of the transatlantic slave trade and the Black American experience.The hierarchy of racial categoriesWhy, then, did he choose African American alongside Asian? Because in America, Blackness is recognised as a political identity born of struggle and oppression. Indian-American identity, by contrast, is often invisible—treated as an immigrant economic niche rather than a racial group needing justice. This is why even Kamala Harris, with a Tamil mother, emphasised her Black identity throughout her rise. The road to power in the US runs smoother through narratives of African American struggle than through the unrelatable caste-linguistic divisions of South Asia.Harris never denied her Indian heritage, but in political messaging, her mother’s dosa recipes were a footnote to her identity as a Black woman, a Howard alum, a beneficiary of the civil rights movement. To many Indian Americans, this choice felt strategic—because American categories do not accommodate multiple truths.The dilemma of tick-box identitiesFor Mamdani, ticking African American was not an attempt to claim a heritage of slavery or Jim Crow. It was an attempt to signal: “I was born in Africa.” But these boxes don’t ask about birthplace; they ask about race. “Even though these boxes are constraining, I wanted my college application to reflect who I was,” he said. He also wrote in “Ugandan” under the form’s open-ended section. But forms don’t read nuance.The hack that revealed his application data showed no speeches or interviews where Mamdani ever called himself Black or African American. Indeed, his political identity today is rooted in his South Asian Muslim heritage. He campaigns in Urdu and Bangla, wears kurtas to rallies, and celebrates being the first South Asian man and Ugandan-born person in the New York State Assembly. Yet at African American gatherings, he references his African birthplace, Uganda’s independence, and his middle name Kwame, after Ghana’s first Prime Minister.It is a delicate tightrope. Identify as Black, and risk charges of opportunism. Identify as Indian, and remain a model minority forever foreign to the American political mainstream. Identify as both, and accusations of identity manipulation follow.Colonial categories in modern AmericaThe deeper problem is that these boxes themselves are relics of imperial racial classification systems. British colonial governments divided populations into neat ethno-racial columns to control them; the US census and college applications inherited this logic. They leave no space for Indian-Ugandans, Indo-Caribbeans, or Tamil Malaysians—global citizens whose identities transcend national borders.For Mamdani, none of it worked anyway. Columbia rejected him. He attended Bowdoin College in Maine and majored in Africana studies. Today, as he challenges Mayor Eric Adams, who is Black, his identification as African American on that teenage application is now political ammunition.But perhaps his teenage choice was less about gaming the system and more about how the system forces you to game yourself: to slice your heritage into boxes acceptable to bureaucrats who will never understand why you don’t fit.The lessonAnd yet, despite ticking both boxes, Columbia rejected him.That is the lesson no one is talking about: racial categories promise advantage, but ultimately, they remain designed to keep out those who don’t fit neatly within them. Mamdani went to Bowdoin College in Maine and majored in Africana studies. Today, as he challenges Mayor Eric Adams, who is Black, his teenage application choices are political ammunition.Ultimately, Mamdani’s saga is not about affirmative action cheating or woke posturing. It is about the impossibility of conveying ancestral history, racial experience, birthplace, migration, expulsion, diaspora, and faith into two or three colonial tick-boxes.He remains an Indian, an African, a Muslim, and an American—all identities that refuse to fit neatly on a Common App form. The tragedy is that he, like so many children of empire, had to choose at all—and that even choosing everything was not enough.","summary":"On the surface, it sounds like an act of calculated advantage-seeking.

They stressed a pro-business agenda and presented themselves as moderates.\n\nAnd both lost recent races for county supervisor in which they were attacked relentlessly for their ties to President Donald Trump, among other things.\n\nLorie Zapf, also a Republican, wasn’t a mayor and had a more conservative profile than either McCann of Chula Vista or Faulconer, the former San Diego mayor. But she might have been the first notable local candidate whose political career was derailed in part because of Trump.\n\nShe lost her re-election bid for the San Diego City Council in 2018 after being pummeled by opponents for her support of Trump.\n\nThat history raises the question of whether Democratic candidates and their labor supporters will play the Trump card in at least three key local races next year for Congress, state Senate and another supervisor seat.\n\nThe answer is unsatisfying: It depends.\n\nTrump may have been a constant in the McCann, Faulconer and Zapf losses, but as almost always is the case, many factors determined the outcomes.\n\nThe underlying political demographics were certainly important. Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer won re-election against Faulconer in November in the heavily Democratic District 3. Imperial Beach Mayor Paloma Aguirre defeated McCann in Tuesday’s special election in District 1, which is also heavily Democratic, though the largely working-class and Latino district is viewed as more conservative.\n\nTrump did better in those districts last year than in 2020, though he still lost big in both.\n\nMeanwhile, voter registration in Zapf’s district had shifted more Democratic during her tenure on the council.\n\nFaulconer and McCann also had unique ties to Trump that other local GOP candidates don’t.\n\nIn 2016, Faulconer said he “could never vote for Trump.” When gearing up to run for governor before the 2021 unsuccessful recall election of Gov. Gavin Newsom, Faulconer famously flipped and said he voted for Trump in 2020. A photo of Faulconer with Trump in the Oval Office was plastered on billboards, in mailers and all over social media by Lawson-Remer and her supporters.\n\nMcCann had to answer to Aguirre’s criticism about his letter to Trump appealing for clemency for a convicted fraudster — who then won early release from prison only to be convicted of fraud again.\n\nZapf didn’t have those kinds of connections, but her support for Trump apparently was enough for opponents to include him in mailers targeting her. Her stand on certain local matters and conservative positions on some social issues also were prominent in her loss to Jennifer Campbell.\n\nThe potential impacts on San Diego of Trump’s policies cutting health care funding, ramping up immigration raids and levying tariffs didn’t crowd out other local issues in Tuesday’s election, but they were a large part of Aguirre’s campaign.\n\nRepublicans have raised potent issues by questioning budget deficits, persistent homelessness, high housing costs and gas taxes under Democratic leadership locally and in Sacramento. But they’re increasingly being forced to answer for actions by Trump and the compliant Republican majorities in Congress.\n\nDemocratic and labor political strategists will be studying the conditions next year in specific races to determine how much they’ll focus on Trump.\n\nUnlike the supervisorial Districts 1 and 3, the key races are in districts that do not have nearly as much, if any, Democratic registration advantage, suggesting a tougher call to go big on Trump attacks.\n\nThe 40th state Senate District is being vacated by Minority Leader Brian Jones, R-Santee, because of term limits. San Marcos City Councilmember Ed Musgrove and former Assembly candidate Kristie Bruce-Lane, both Republicans, are running, as is San Diego City Councilmember Marni von Wilpert, the only major Democrat in the race so far.\n\nThe district includes portions of North County and East County and part of the city of San Diego. Democratic and Republican registration is nearly equal, with a large portion of voters declining to state a party preference.\n\nKamala Harris carried the district by nearly 4 points over Trump last year, though that was just over half the victory margin of President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nRepublican Supervisor Jim Desmond also is termed out of his North County District 5, where he was re-elected in a landslide in 2022, even though the district has been trending Democratic. Harris beat Trump there by more than 13,800 votes. As it happens, that’s about the same size as the Democratic voter registration advantage over Republicans in the district.\n\nSo far, two Republicans have announced they are running: Vista Mayor John Franklin and San Marcos Mayor Rebecca Jones. Kyle Krahel-Frolander, who is stepping aside as the county Democratic Party chair, has been weighing a candidacy.\n\nDesmond, a former San Marcos mayor, is running for Congress against Democratic incumbent Mike Levin in the 49th District, which straddles the San Diego-Orange County line. He’ll face an uphill battle and there’s little doubt Levin will attempt to make Desmond account for Trump policies Levin believes are detrimental.\n\nIn each of his four elections — all of which have been competitive — Levin has used Trump to his benefit in the purple district, where Democrats hold a slight registration edge. The district rejected Trump three times.\n\nDesmond, who appeared to be a moderate, pro-business mayor, has leaned more to the right as supervisor, largely supporting Trump on such issues as immigration and COVID policies.\n\nMuch was made of Trump’s improved showing in California last year, when he flipped 10 counties that went for Biden in 2020. Further, Republicans gained three seats in the Legislature.\n\nBut Trump still only received about 38 percent of the vote, losing to Harris by more than 20 points. Meanwhile, Republicans lost three California U.S. House seats.\n\nThat left the GOP with a thin majority and 2026 is an off-year election, when the party in control of the White House tends to struggle in congressional races.","summary":"Many factors figured into the election defeats of McCann and Faulconer.

It appears that Biden officials were rushing to deploy billions in approved funding in anticipation that the incoming Trump administration would seek to redirect uncommitted money away from clean energy projects.\n\nThe agreements were made despite a warning from the department’s inspector general, urging the loan office to suspend operations in December over concerns that postelection loans could present conflicts of interest. \n\nIn just a few months, some of the deals have already become dicey, leading to fears that the Biden administration has created multiple Solyndras, the green energy company that went bankrupt after the Obama administration gave it $570 million. These deals include:\n\nSunnova, a rooftop solar outfit that thus far had $382 million of its $3.3 billion loan guaranteed, filed for bankruptcy this month. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLi-Cycle, a battery recycling facility, had a $445 million loan approved in November, but since then, the company was put up for sale and has filed for bankruptcy. The Energy Department said no money has been disbursed on that deal. Li-Cycle did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA $705 million loan was approved on Jan. 17 for Zum Energy, an electric school bus company in California, and its “Project Marigold.” At $350,000 and more, electric school buses currently cost more than twice as much as their diesel counterparts. So far, Zum has received $21.7 million from the government, according to usaspending.gov. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA $9.63 billion Blue Oval SK loan on Jan. 16 was the second largest postelection deal, topped only by a $15 billion loan the next day to Pacific Gas & Electric, with most of that for renewables. The Blue Oval project in Kentucky—a joint venture between Ford Motor Co. and a South Korean entity—has been dealing with numerous workplace complaints, and construction of a second EV battery manufacturing plant there has been delayed. More than $7 billion has been obligated on that deal, according to the Energy Department. Blue Oval did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe money and the hasty way in which it was earmarked have drawn the attention of the Trump administration. “It is extremely concerning how many dozens of billions of dollars were rushed out the door without proper due diligence in the final days of the Biden administration,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement to RealClearInvestigations. “DOE is undertaking a thorough review of financial assistance that identifies waste of taxpayer dollars.”\n\nThe enormous sums came from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which injected $400 billion into the Loan Programs Office, a previously sleepy Energy Department branch originally intended to spur nuclear energy projects. That total represented more than 10 times the amount the Loan Programs Office had ever committed in any fiscal year of its existence. Prior to the postelection blowout, the office’s biggest fiscal year was 2024, when it committed $34.8 billion, records show.\n\nEven with the rush to push billions out the door in its last months, close to $300 billion of the Inflation Reduction Act money remains uncommitted by the Loan Programs Office. Trump administration officials have already nixed some smaller deals. Wright recently urged Congress to keep the money in place as the Loan Programs Office now aims to use it to further the Trump administration’s energy policy, particularly with nuclear projects.\n\nThat unprecedented gusher of cash from the Loan Programs Office echoes the efforts of the Biden administration’s Environmental Protection Agency to push $20 billion out the door before it left office. As RealClearInvestigations has previously reported, the EPA—which had never been a consequential grant-making operation—was tasked with awarding $27 billion in Inflation Reduction Act funding through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and Solar for All programs. It did so in less than six months in 2024, including an unorthodox arrangement in which Biden officials parked some $20 billion outside the Treasury’s control. That money was earmarked for a handful of nonprofits, some of which had skimpy assets and were linked with politically connected directors.\n\nThe Loan Programs Office’s postelection bonanza was put together in even less time. The Energy Department deals, however, involve mostly for-profit enterprises, which raises questions about whether the Biden administration was propping up companies that would not have survived in the private marketplace. Should any of the companies hit it big in the future, shareholders could get rich, while taxpayers will receive only the interest on the loan.\n\n“The loan office should not be in the virtual venture business,” said Mark Mills, executive director of the National Center on Energy Analytics. “But in a few cases, it could make sense to serve as a catalyst or backstop for viable and important projects from a national security or policy perspective.”\n\nRealClearInvestigations spoke with several Trump administration officials who declined to comment on the record, given the extensive ongoing review of both the Loan Programs Office’s postelection arrangements and other Energy Department projects linked to former President Joe Biden’s climate agenda.\n\n“They wanted to get the billions to companies that probably wouldn’t exist unless they could get money from the government,” one current official said. “The business plans, such as they were, were ‘how do we secure capital from the government?’”\n\nDuring Biden’s tenure, the office was run by Jigar Shah, who on June 17 was named to the board of directors of the nonprofit Center for Sustainable Energy. Bloomberg News reported last month that Shah “helped select roughly 400 companies with development plans to receive grants and loans upward of $100 million each.” In response to the Trump administration’s pushback on green subsidies, Bloomberg reported that Shah is working to help some of the companies he bankrolled shift operations to Europe.\n\nThe center relies chiefly on government contracts instead of donations, and it saw that revenue jump from $274.1 million in 2023 to more than $500 million in 2024, according to tax records. The center did not respond to a request to speak with Shah.\n\nThus far, no entity has received the entire amount of the deals the Biden administration struck since last November, according to the Energy Department and usaspending.gov. In a handful of cases, companies have come to the current administration and opted out of the deals.\n\nStill, millions of taxpayer dollars have already been distributed, in some instances, to deals the department listed as “conditional commitments.” Wright has said there are “reasons to be worried and suspicious” about the postelection binge and vowed some of the deals will be scrubbed. \n\nIn 2023, the Biden administration made subtle changes to the Loan Programs Office’s regulations, cutting strings and stipulations that traditionally attach to loans. Consequently, the office cut deals after the election on terms more favorable to the recipient than the taxpayer, and in several cases, making a “conditional commitment” the same as a loan, according to Trump officials. The changes also moved money that a later administration could have cut into “obligated” silos, making the deals harder to cancel, according to the current Energy Department.\n\n“Essentially, they had the Loan Programs Office operating like a graveyard energy venture capital fund,” one Trump official told RealClearInvestigations. “This was all tied to the religious fervor for any green energy project in the prior administration, and the goal was not to get the government repaid but to advance the ‘green new deal.’”\n\nThe $93 billion under review represents a separate “green bank” from smaller Biden administration deals that the Energy Department has already canceled. Last month, the Government Accounting Office said the department was not on track to “issue loans and guarantees before billions of dollars of new funding expires.”\n\nAs part of the review, Wright issued policy guidelines in May that he said offer more protection to taxpayers. The department may now require significantly more information from loan recipients and applicants, such as “a project’s financial health, a project’s technological and engineering viability, market conditions, compliance with award terms and conditions and compliance with legal requirements, including those related to national security.”\n\nThe department declined to provide the terms of specific deals, again citing the ongoing review. Trump administration officials claim the business plans for many of these deals were threadbare, that term sheets were essentially tossed out, and the entire process could be described, in the words of a Biden EPA official in December, as “throwing gold bars” off the Titanic “as an insurance policy against Trump winning.”\n\nDespite these dubious outcomes and the alleged removal of taxpayer protections that accompanied the deals, Trump administration officials said they remain committed to the Loan Programs Office. The office has a valuable role to play in fulfilling energy policy goals, which include nuclear projects, strengthening the nation’s power grid, and limiting the U.S. reliance on Chinese supply chains for key minerals and elements.\n\n“It’s as if you went away and the kids threw a rager in the house,” one official told RealClearInvestigations. “You may need some new furniture and the like, but it’s still a really nice home. The Office can be a critical resource for the manufacturing base of this country, and our goal is not to end the Loan Programs Office but to improve it.”\n\nThe Trump administration could face some of the same financial issues if it rejiggers the Loan Programs Office along lines that support its energy policy goals, particularly within the nuclear industry. Projects there have been marred by unprofitable plants and massive cost overruns and delays in construction, making federal loans to the section inherently risky. \n\nProminent voices—and investors—like Bill Gates have also encouraged the government to back new sources of energy and minerals. Geothermal projects are one such field, and there appears to be bipartisan support in Washington for capital that will shore up U.S. energy independence. On Jan. 15, the Biden administration approved a $1.2 billion “conditional commitment” with a subsidiary of EnergySource Minerals LLC, which hopes to extract lithium from geothermal brine.\n\nA deal with ioneer Ltd. appears to match some of the professed goals of the Trump administration, but it has also been plagued by financial setbacks since Biden’s Loan Programs Office approved it in its final days. The company’s deal grew from an original $700 million “conditional commitment” in 2023, to the $996 million approved on Jan. 17, 2025.”\n\nThe Rhyolite Ridge project is a mining and manufacturing center in Nevada that produces lithium and boron. Those elements have implications for defense and national security in addition to energy, according to Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich. \n\n“Ioneer believes government policy should encourage projects if we want critical minerals developed domestically,” Yeftich said. “Time is the key risk for development as China continues to provide financial support to its critical minerals industry and dump critical minerals into the market thereby depressing the price.”\n\nYeftich noted Rhyolite Ridge has secured $200 million in private capital, but in February, its chief private equity partner broke ties with the project. Finance professionals familiar with big deals told RealClearInvestigations that such a rupture so close in timing to the loan would likely deep-six the arrangement, but Trump officials said Biden’s Loan Programs Office stripped such boilerplate language from many of the postelection deals. \n\nWright told RealClearInvestigations that these maneuvers suggested the previous administration was more interested in disbursing funds than protecting taxpayers. “Any reputable business would have a process in place for evaluating spending and investments before money goes out the door, and the American people deserve no less from their federal government.”\n\nOriginally published by RealClearInvestigations","summary":"In its last two working days, the Biden administration’s Energy Department signed off on nearly $42 billion for green energy projects—a sum that exceeded the...

This could lead to an estimated 12 million more people without insurance by 2034.\n\nThe legislation is also likely to add between $3 trilion and $5 trillion to the national debt by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe power of the presidency\n\nTrump is not the first president to bend Congress to his will to get legislation approved. \n\nPresidential supremacy over the legislative process has been on the rise for decades. But contrary to popular belief, lawmakers are not always simply voting based on blind partisanship. \n\nIncreasingly, politicians in the same political party as a president are voting in line with the president because their political futures are as tied up with the president’s reputation as they have ever been.\n\nEven when national polling indicates a policy is unpopular – as is the case with Trump’s budget reconciliation bill, which an estimated 55% of American voters said in June they oppose, according to Quinnipiac University polling – lawmakers in the president’s party have serious motivation to follow the president’s lead. \n\nOr else they risk losing reelection.\n\nLawmakers increasingly partisan on presidential policy\n\nOver the past 50 years, lawmakers in the president’s party have increasingly supported the president’s position on legislation that passes Congress. Opposition lawmakers, meanwhile, are increasingly united against the president’s position.\n\nIn 1970, for example, when Republican President Richard Nixon was in the White House, Republicans in Congress voted along with his positions 72% of the time. But the Democratic majority in Congress voted with him nearly as much, at 60% of the time, particularly on Nixon’s more progressive environmental agenda. \n\nThese patterns are unheard of in the modern Congress. In 2022, for example – a year of significant legislative achievement for the Biden administration – the Democratic majority in Congress voted the same way as the Democratic president 99% of the time. Republicans, meanwhile, voted with Biden just 19% of the time.\n\nElections can tell us why\n\nOver the past half-century, the two major parties have changed dramatically, both in the absolutist nature of their beliefs and in relation to one another. \n\nBoth parties used to be more mixed in their ideological outlooks, for example, with conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans playing key roles in policymaking. This made it easier to form cross-party coalitions, either with or against the president. \n\nA few decades ago, Democrats and Republicans were also less geographically polarized from each other. Democrats were regularly elected to congressional seats in the South, for example, even if those districts supported Republican presidents such as Nixon or Ronald Reagan.\n\nMuch of this has changed in recent decades. \n\nCongress members are not just ideologically at odds with colleagues in the other party – they are more similar than ever to other members within their party. \n\nDistricts supporting the two parties are also increasingly geographically distant from each other, often along an urban-rural divide. \n\nAnd presidents in particular have become polarizing partisan figures on the national stage.\n\nThese changes have ushered in a larger phenomenon called political nationalization, in which local political considerations, issues and candidate qualifications have taken a back seat to national politics.\n\nTicket splitting\n\nFrom the 1960s through most of the 1980s, between one-quarter and one-half of all congressional districts routinely split tickets – meaning they sent a politician of one party to Congress while supporting a different party for president. \n\nThese are the same few districts in Nebraska and New York, for example, that supported former Vice President Kamala Harris for president in 2024 but which also elected a Republican candidate to the House that same year. \n\nSince the Reagan years, however, these types of districts that could simultaneously support a Democratic presidential nominee and Republicans for Congress have gone nearly extinct. Today, only a handful of districts split their tickets, and all other districts select the same party for both offices. \n\nThe past two presidential elections, in 2020 and 2024, set the same record low for ticket splitting. Just 16 out of 435 House districts voted for different parties for the House of Representatives and president.\n\nMembers of Congress follow their voters\n\nThe political success of members of Congress has become increasingly tied up with the success or failure of the president. Because nearly all Republicans hail from districts and states that are very supportive of Trump and his agenda, following the will of their voters increasingly means being supportive of the president’s agenda. \n\nNot doing so risks blowback from their Trump-supporting constituents. A June 2025 Quinnipiac University poll found that 67% of Republicans support the bill, while 87% of Democrats oppose it.\n\nThese electoral considerations also help explain the unanimous opposition to Trump’s legislation by the Democrats, nearly all of whom represent districts and states that did not support Trump in 2024. \n\nThanks to party polarization in ideologies, geography and in the electorate, few Democrats could survive politically while strongly supporting Trump. And few Republicans could do so while opposing him.\n\nBut as the importance to voters of mere presidential support increases, the importance of members’ skill in fighting for issues unique to their districts has decreased. This can leave important local concerns about, for example, unique local environmental issues or declining economic sectors unspoken for. At the very least, members have less incentive to speak for them.\n\nCharlie Hunt, Associate Professor of Political Science, Boise State University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Barbecues. Potlucks. Fireworks displays. Parades. All delightful celebrations. I'd like to add another to the list: naturalization ceremonies.\n\nSociety has been missing out by omitting these from the classic Independence Day festivities. The events—during which immigrants are sworn in as U.S. citizens—are infectiously happy occasions generally. (They are free and open to the public, and you can easily find any happening near you via a quick Google search.) But the ones scheduled yearly on the Fourth also serve as a particularly relevant reminder that people can, and do, choose to be American. \n\nThere are many reasons someone might do so, chief among them the very reasons we celebrate the Fourth of July in the first place: Despite our problems, the U.S. offers the sort of freedom, liberty, and opportunity that is anathema to many places around the world. Naturalization ceremonies shine a spotlight on American exceptionalism in a way that most other events cannot.\n\nNot everyone agrees, particularly as we continue sitting in a time of intense polarization around most everything, but especially around immigration. On Tim Pool's Timcast IRL show last week, for example, the popular podcaster told me that New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani should be stripped of his citizenship and deported, while the remainder of his panel added that we should stop accepting immigrants entirely, at least temporarily. (Mary Morgan, one of the commentators at Timcast, applied this same logic to former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, despite the fact that he was born in Ohio, but I digress.)\n\nThe pushback, however, is worth confronting in good faith, especially as it intersects with a holiday that effectively exists to celebrate what makes America great. \"I reject the idea that the only way you can be American is by being born here,\" I told them. This country, after all, stands for a litany of beautiful things: freedom of expression, property rights, economic opportunity, and equality under the law. Those things are often not guaranteed elsewhere around the globe. Even in countries like the United Kingdom and Germany—supposedly free places—we're witnessing law enforcement arrest people over peaceful expression and online posts, and that's to say nothing of countries like Venezuela and Cuba, where centrally-planned economies have left many without even a shot at real success.\n\n\"​​I think it's beautiful that some people are Americans by choice,\" I said. \"And I don't think that makes them any less American.\"\n\nThere is data to support that naturalized Americans are, on the whole, prouder to be here than the native-born. A 2019 study found that 79 percent of naturalized citizens agreed when asked if \"America is a better country than most other countries,\" compared to 73 percent of the native-born. And when asked, \"How proud are you of being American?\" 75 percent of naturalized American citizens said they were \"very proud,\" versus 69 percent of the native-born. That gap shouldn't be surprising, given that the former chose this country.\n\nThis discussion is also often dogged by the claim that immigrants are imported to vote for Democrats. While I don't place much stock in voting patterns generally, it remains true that naturalized citizens—about 9 percent of the electorate—split very evenly between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in 2024, with some researchers concluding those voters favored Trump by one point.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan presciently weighed in on this debate decades ago. \"You can go to live in France, but you cannot become a Frenchman. You can go to live in Germany, Turkey, or Japan, but you cannot become a German, a Turk, or a Japanese,\" he said in 1990. \"But anyone, from any corner of the world, can come to live in America and become an American.\"\n\nIt may be a corny quote. That doesn't make it less timeless.","summary":"Despite our problems, the U.S. offers the sort of freedom, liberty, and opportunity that is anathema to many places around the world.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/07/04/independence-day-reminds-us-that-you-can-be-american-by-choice/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/07/patriotic-immigrants-july-4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-04 10:30:10","author":"Billy Binion","authors":["Billy Binion"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.121},{"id":338256300,"title":"Welcome to the Mafia Presidency","text":"Theoretically, it’s illegal for the president to accept or solicit bribes. The plain language of the statute is perfectly clear: It is a crime for a public official to seek or receive “anything of value” in return for “being influenced in the performance of any official act.” The prohibition applies whether the public official seeks or receives the bribe personally or on behalf of “any other person or entity.”\n\nAs I said: theoretically. On Tuesday, the media-and-entertainment conglomerate Paramount announced a $16 million payment to President Donald Trump’s future presidential library. The payment settled a lawsuit that Trump had filed against the Paramount-owned broadcaster CBS because he was unhappy with the way the network had edited an election-season interview with then–Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump’s lawsuit was about as meritless as a lawsuit can be, for reasons I’ll explain shortly. If CBS were a freestanding news organization, it would have fought the case and won. But like the Disney-owned network ABC, which also paid off Trump for an almost equally frivolous lawsuit, CBS belongs to a parent corporation with regulatory business before Trump-appointed agencies. Paramount is pursuing an $8 billion merger that requires approval from the Federal Communications Commission. In November 2024, then-incoming FCC Chair Brendan Carr warned that merger approval would depend on satisfying Trump’s claims against CBS. Carr told the Fox News interviewer Dana Perino, “I’m pretty confident that that news-distortion complaint over the 60 Minutes transcript is something that is likely to arise in the context of the FCC review of that transaction.”\n\n“News-distortion complaint?” What’s that? Nearly a century ago, in 1927, Congress empowered a new Federal Radio Commission to police the accuracy of news broadcasts. In the preceding decades, the airwaves had become a chaos of transmissions interfering with one another. The right to use any particular frequency was a valuable concession from the federal government, the owner on the public’s behalf of the nation’s airwaves. Congress felt that it could impose conditions in return for such concessions. One condition was a duty to meet public-interest standards in broadcast content, which included giving equal time to opposing political candidates in an election. In 1934, the Federal Radio Commission evolved into the Federal Communications Commission. As television technology spread, so did the FCC’s ambition to police the new medium, resulting in 1949 with its power to compel the fairness doctrine on “all discussion of issues of importance to the public.”\n\nThe fact that opinions can differ about what counts as “accuracy” and what counts as “distortion” rapidly became obvious. Government efforts to police the boundary between fair reporting and unfair scurrility create conflicts with First Amendment rights. For print media, the courts have been very clear: Editing, even arguably unfair editing, is protected free speech, subject only to the laws of defamation. In the 1960s and ’70s, the FCC groped its way toward a similar rule for broadcast media. Interestingly, some of the crucial milestones involved CBS News.\n\nIn the early days of color television, CBS News pioneered the use of aggressive editing to tell powerful stories in dramatic ways. In 1971, for example, CBS broadcast a documentary, The Selling of the Pentagon, that accused the Department of Defense of manipulating public opinion. To amplify the argument, the producers cut and reassembled questions and answers. Some of the affected individuals filed complaints against CBS, and the matter was taken up by members of Congress. Yet the FCC declined to get involved in the case on free-speech grounds.\n\nBefore the end of the first Nixon administration, the FCC had generated a series of precedents that more or less nullified the agency’s Calvin Coolidge–era status as a monitor of broadcast accuracy and a potential censor. The whole issue soon became moot, because the FCC had no jurisdiction over cable television or the internet. As Americans drew more of their information from sources outside the FCC’s domain, the very idea of content regulation by the agency came to seem absurd to all parties, including the FCC itself. Who would think of invoking a doctrine that originated in 1927 to police speech in the 21st century?\n\nThen came Trump and the loyalty-above-law appointees of his second term. Evident from the Trump legal filing against CBS is that not even the president’s own lawyers took his complaint seriously. Three whopping clues give away the game about the filing’s farcicality.\n\nThe first is where the lawsuit was brought: the Amarillo division of the U.S. district court for the northern district of Texas. CBS is not domiciled in Amarillo. Neither is Trump or Harris or any person significantly connected with the 60 Minutes segment. What is located in Amarillo is America’s premier pick for right-wing forum-shopping, a practice criticized not only by liberal counterparties but also, at least implicitly, by The Wall Street Journal and National Review. Amarillo is the court where a partisan-conservative plaintiff goes with a case that would be summarily thrown out elsewhere.\n\nThe next clue is the language of the filing, which reads like direct dictation from the president:\n\nAnd so on, through 65 paragraphs of irrelevant name-calling and Trump-quoting obsequiousness.\n\nThe final clue lies in the carelessness of the complaint’s quoted sources, two of which actually argue against the Trump claim. A cited law-review article concluded that “the reinvented news distortion doctrine would undermine the very democratic norms marshaled in its defense.” Similarly, an FCC decision referenced found against taking action (in another case involving CBS)—explicitly on free-speech grounds: “In this democracy, no government agency can authenticate the news, or should try to do so.”\n\nOne has to wonder whether Trump’s lawyers even read the texts they cited. The complaint’s flimsy legal basis—including Trump’s claim of standing under a Texas consumer-protection law—indicates its pure-nuisance quality. And yet, Paramount paid $16 million to settle a case that it could almost certainly have won for a fraction of the price.\n\nU.S. law forbids both accepting a bribe and soliciting a bribe, yet they’re not exactly the same offense. There is an important difference between a police officer who takes money to let a criminal escape and a police officer who uses the threat of arrest to extort money from an innocent citizen. Paramount did not come up with the idea to pay Trump $16 million; Trump decided to squeeze Paramount for the money. What’s going on here is extortion—and it does not get any less extortionate for being laundered through Trump’s hypothetical future library. A systematic pattern has emerged: shakedowns of law firms, business corporations, and media companies for the enrichment of Trump, his family, and his political allies. Every time targets yield, they create an incentive for Trump to repeat the shakedown on another victim.\n\nThis time, it was Paramount’s turn. Who will be the next target of an administration that governs by mafia methods?","summary":"That’s a nice business you’ve got there.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/07/welcome-mafia-presidency/683433/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/3n2uMPwMK1LeTio2GeAysEiX2zU=/0x43:2000x1085/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/07/2025_07_03_Frum_Paramount_shakedown_final_1/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-04 10:30:00","author":"David Frum","authors":["David Frum"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.166},{"id":338196946,"title":"Melania's unexpected praise for Taylor Swift amid Donald Trump's sharp criticism of American singer","text":"ReutersIn Mid-may, Trump had posted about Taylor Swift, who endorsed the then Vice-President Kamala Harris during the 2024 election campaign\n\nUS First Lady Melania Trump visited patients at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., Thursday, decorating rocks and asking kids about their favorite hobbies.

But this last one has been rough","text":"Happy Birthday, America! Today, you turn 249 and, honestly, you don’t look a day over 248. (Ha ha.) Seriously, it’s perfectly understandable why there’s more gray on your scalp and deeper worry lines on your face. This last year has been challenging, to say the least. A convicted felon and adjudicated sex abuser was elected president — history made! — and ever since has worked tirelessly and diligently to establish himself as the nation's first monarch, and a fabulously remunerated one at that. Federal troops are occupying the nation’s second-largest city, over the objection of the state’s leaders, as masked agents scoop people off the streets of Southern California for the temerity of venturing out with brown skin and an accent. Our social safety net is being shredded, the country is pulling back from its international leadership in the arts and science, and we’ve squandered our global standing as a beacon of hope and compassion. But that's not all. Political violence is becoming about as familiar and normalized as schoolyard shootings. In roughly the last 12 months we’ve witnessed two attempts on Trump's life and the assassination of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband. Medicaid, the program that serves millions of the needy, elderly and disabled, is on the chopping block. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which helps Americans weather the worst times after natural disaster, has been drastically depleted just as we're heading into the fire and hurricane seasons. As for the loyal opposition, Democrats are in bad odor with voters and even many of their own partisans after Joe Biden's handlers gaslighted the public on the frailty and declining faculties of the octogenarian president. Only after a cataclysmically bad debate performance, which revealed his infirmities for all to see, did Biden grudgingly stand aside in favor of his anointed successor, Vice President Kamala Harris. Once more, Democrats are wandering the wilderness, wearing a familiar groove in their desolate pathway as they debate — again — whether to veer left or hug the center. That's quite the catalog. But no one ever said this representative democracy thing was going to be easy, or endlessly uplifting. America, you're a big, boisterous nation of more than 342 million people, with all sorts of competing impulses and interests, and no end of certitude to go around. In our last presidential election, we split nearly evenly, with Trump squeaking past Harris in the popular vote 49.8% to 48.3%. It was one of the narrowest margins of victory in the last century, though you wouldn't know it from Trump's radical actions and the servility of the Republican-run Congress. But our differences are more profound than the now-familiar gulf between red and blue America. In a recently completed deep dive on the state of our democracy, researchers at UC Berkeley found an almost even divide over how to measure our political system's success. Slightly more than half of those surveyed said a successful democracy is one that's adaptable and has the capacity for change, while nearly half said success stems from adherence to long-standing principles. With that kind of stark disagreement on such a fundamental question, is it any wonder we struggle to find consensus on so much else? But, heck, if it's any consolation on this star-spangled holiday, the country has been through worse. Much worse. And you, America, have not only survived but also in many ways grown stronger by facing down your flaws and overcoming some knee-buckling challenges. Slavery. Civil war. Racist exclusionary laws. Two worldwide conflicts. Depression. Financial crises. And too many deadly natural disasters — floods, fires, earthquakes, hurricanes — to possibly count. Your treatment of some Americans, it should be said, hasn't always been fair and just. People are despairing over the Supreme Court and its deference to the president. But it's worth noting that earlier court majorities held that Black Americans — \"beings of an inferior order,\" in the words of the notorious Dred Scott decision — could be denied citizenship, that racial segregation was constitutional and that compulsory sterilization based on eugenics was perfectly legal. That sordid history won't necessarily make anyone feel better about the current state of affairs, nor should it. But it does give some perspective. All of that said, today's a day to celebrate the good things and the bright, shining place you aspire to be, with liberty and justice for all. So, chin up, America! Have another slice of birthday cake, and don't worry about the calories — you really do look terrific for 249! Meantime, it's up to us, your citizens, to keep working toward that more perfect union. Whatever ails you, America, the remedy resides with we the people and the power we hold, particularly at the ballot box. Unhappy with the wrecking crew that's chain-sawing federal programs and allowing Trump to blowtorch the Constitution and rule of law? Vote 'em out, starting with the 2026 midterm election. Don't give up hope or the belief that, as dark and difficult as things seem right now, better days lie ahead. That abiding faith is what makes America great.","summary":"The social safety net is being shredded, we're losing our edge in arts and science and have squandered our standing as a beacon of hope.

He has most recently persuaded the Senate and House of Representatives to push through his Big Beautiful Bill that will strip millions of Americans, white and Black, of their health care. This is after he gutted the federal workforce, sending thousands of governmental employees (again, both white and Black) packing. What’s shocking is that many of the people he is hurting helped the man get into the White House.\n\nBy now it is common knowledge that white Americans are the reason why Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris in 2024. But there is a deeper question we need to be asking that is bigger than why the man who currently sits behind the Resolute Desk is there.\n\nThe question is as simple as it is complex. Why are we so deeply polarized in this country along racial lines?\n\nThe division runs deep. So deep, in fact, that many fail to realize that we, white and Black folks, have so much in common politically. Especially when it comes to working class white people. If they were to only open their eyes, they would see they have far more in common with Black folks than they do with Trump and people like him.\n\nSo how did we get here? Well, unsurprisingly, much of what we are seeing traces back to America’s original sin: slavery and the war between the states that erupted in its wake.\n\nIf you ask most white folks in the South about their ethnicity (their cultural identity), they will just tell you they are American. If you ask most in the North, they will identify as American, yes, but also as Irish, Italian or some other ethnicity that traces back to Europe. Why is this important? Because it shows how the political establishment at that time (almost all white men) convinced white people to identify as white above all else. They did that to solidify support against the growing movement to free slaves. But they did not stop there.\n\nAfter losing the Civil War, political leaders continued to pit white Americans against Black ones. They convinced all whites, but especially working-class ones, to see Black Americans as their enemy. They told them Black men were animalistic and after their daughters and they persuaded some to see Black women as welfare queens who did not want to work. But Black folks are not without blame in this.\n\nWe have always looked suspiciously at white politicians who wanted our vote. But there are an untold number of Black politicians who courted the Black vote and then did not do what’s best for the Black community.\n\nAny time a person threatened to bring together white and Black people politically, they just happened to be killed. That is not to say that this is the reason why Bobby Kennedy, who was building a biracial political coalition, or Fred Hampton, who was politically uniting working-class white and Black people in Chicago, was killed. \n\nSo again White and Black people have more in common that we like to admit. We may not all like the same music nor do we season our food the same way. But we would be wise to look past the way political leaders try to divide us. Because none of us are helped by seeing each other as the enemy.","summary":"We need to understand that America's current racial political divisions did not happen naturally.

The actress is in the middle of a press tour for her new Netflix movie “The Old Guard 2.” \n\n“She decided to go on a podcast tour for some reason,” Kelly said. “She sat down with ‘Call Her Daddy,’ the sex podcaster who interviewed Kamala Harris — all about how much they love abortions.” She chastised the actress for trying to act like a “super cool girl.”\n\nOn the “Call Her Daddy” episode Theron was asked to give her best sex advice and the actress responded candidly saying, “I am the last person to ask [for sex tips]. I’m sounding very cocky here, but I think it’s because I’ve found this freedom in my 40s where I’m like, ‘Oh my god.’ Just for perspective, I’ve probably had three one-night stands in my entire life. But I did just recently f–k a 26-year-old, and it was really amazing. I’ve never done that. And I was like, ‘Oh, this is great.’ Women should be the ones that are like, ‘F–k you, I’m going to have an orgasm.’”\n\nKelly looked appalled and pointed out the irony that she was criticizing Theron of all people, who played her in 2019’s “Bombshell.” She also made a point to note that she can’t be sued for defamation for sharing her opinion, because she was clearly stating it was just her opinion. \n\n“Maybe she’s just boring and stays home on Friday nights, but it seems like she’s compensating for something,” Kelly said. “She’s 49 years old trying to sound 26. It feels weird. She’s one of our biggest stars — act like it. Have some class.”\n\nKelly clearly took issue with the open discussion about sex on the podcast and called talking about it “vulgar” and “inappropriate.” She also blasted Theron for her commentary about single motherhood and the role men played in her life.\n\n“It’s strange to see one of our most famous actresses sit down cross-legged with a sex podcaster talking about orgasms and who they slept with,” she said. “It’s off-putting. Then she doubles down on how little she needs a man in her life, even when it comes to child-rearing.”\n\nIronically, on the “Call Her Daddy” episode Theron talked about the harsh judgement single mothers and older women face when they don’t have men in their lives. The “Mad Max: Fury Road” actress said the assumption is that something must be wrong with the woman. Theron added that she felt an immense sense of freedom that comes from raising a child alone. \n\n“That’s just affectation,” Kelly said of the actress’ comments while also chiding her for swearing so much. “She’s trying to be the cool, young girl who doesn’t need a man. She’s proud that there’s no father in the picture. Great. Good for you. People can make up their own minds, but this isn’t how I want to see our biggest stars behave. She’s on the opposite side of the political aisle from us, but you never see Julia Roberts do this kind of thing.”\n\nYou can listen to the full “The Megyn Kelly Show” segment in the video above.","summary":"The conservative host takes issue with the \"The Old Guard 2\" actress sharing sex advice on this week's \"Call Her Daddy\"\n\n\nThe post Megyn Kelly Rebukes Charlize Theron for ‘Vulgar’ Orgasm Comments: ‘Have Some Class’ appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/megyn-kelly-rebukes-charlize-theron-for-vulgar-sex-comments/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Untitled-design-51.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-04 01:35:30","author":"Alex Cooper.

For those who have forgotten: On November 1, 2024, he filed suit in the Trump-friendly Northern District of Texas, demanding an astronomical ten billion dollars from CBS News’s 60 Minutes.\n\nCBS’s offense? Editing a recent 60 Minutes interview of Kamala Harris before broadcast — something that 60 Minutes has done, along with all other news organizations, including Fox, as standard practice since it came into existence. Trump’s lawsuit claimed that by editing out Harris’s fumbling non-responses, 60 Minutes had harmed America’s ability to see her incompetence, thus . . . harming him too? Harming his campaign’s ability to win? Harming America? This last is actually what his lawyers went with: The official language in their complaint argued that 60 Minutes’ editing was meant to “confuse, deceive, and mislead the public.” But none of this matters, of course.\n\nThis lawsuit was designed only to be used as a bludgeon, not to be won. It never could have been, for obvious reasons; it must be emphasized how Trump’s claim was utterly farcical on its face. Anyone who has survived law school Torts knows that no conceivable mechanism exists in the law — in the law of any modern civilized nation in the world, mind you, not just the United States — sufficient to allow Donald Trump to compel a third party to release unflattering details about a political rival. (Hence the language about “deceiving the public” — and yet the “public” is rather obviously not a party to this suit.)\n\nAre CBS News and 60 Minutes laughably biased outfits that distort the news in favor of the left? Of course they are, and as someone who’s been watching 60 Minutes since the days of Bradley and Wallace, I can tell you they didn’t arrive at that position recently. I think much the same applies, in fact, to every single media outlet on television. But that never has been, nor will it ever be, grounds for a civil suit. “Confusing the public” is not a cause of action. (If it ever becomes one, I propose the first thing we do is band together as a certified class and sue Tucker Carlson.)\n\nNo, this was instead yet another example of Trump’s famously long history of employing lawfare against his enemies: using the costs and burdens of the legal system to intimidate and persecute his opponents. In his old pre-presidential days, Trump and his attorneys were fond of the so-called SLAPP suit (“strategic lawsuit against public participation”), suits designed to punish speech about him that he didn’t like but had no plausible legal recourse against. The legal process and expense of conducting a proper defense — especially for poorer defendants — is meant to be the punishment itself. It’s an unfortunately common and cynical tactic when rich actors have the money to face off against the little guy.\n\nBut now Trump, as president of the United States, is the biggest man of them all — the leader of the free world and the head of American government. And he has not changed his ways; his actions threaten to set terrible new precedents for how a president can wield the power of the state against the media and the private sector to get them to say and do what he wants.\n\nFor it is widely understood that the real reason Paramount settled Trump’s lawsuit — for $16 million donated to his presidential library, plus a promise to publish all presidential interview transcripts in the future — is because it is desperate to complete its corporate merger with Skydance Media. Both Paramount and the federal government are, of course, at great pains to deny that there is any relationship whatsoever between the sudden settlement of a completely spurious lawsuit filed by the president of the United States in his private capacity, and the need to complete an $8 billion merger currently being held up by federal regulators, and if you buy that line, then congratulations: You might be the only person in America who does.\n\nThis is appallingly vulgar, of course. (For one thing, I imagine CBS News employees are in excellent spirits with high morale right about now.) But it represents something far beyond mere crassness: This is the sort of nakedly cynical use of state power that feels more like the strong-arm tactics employed by — which euphemism suits us best here? — “emerging democracies” than anything American.\n\nTrump seems entirely happy to pursue his private interests with all the tools given to him by his temporary control over federal power, as if both are merely part of the same personal industry. (And if you doubt this, recall that only a month ago this man accepted a new Air Force One from a nation of shady Gulf oil billionaires, one he plans to retire to his private control after the presidency.) And I suspect it will never stop. I think that as far as Trump is concerned, the power he wields is there to be used — in his behalf as well as what he perceives America’s to be.\n\nA confession: In December of last year, after Trump won but before he took office, I celebrated his victory over ABC News and George Stephanopoulos in an eerily similar lawsuit to the just-settled CBS one. And although I can still intellectually distinguish that case from the present one — Stephanopoulos was nailed dead to rights on his erroneous on-air statement that Trump was found liable for rape in the E. Jean Carroll case, raising a facially plausible defamation claim — I immediately lived to regret my enthusiasm when it became clear that Trump himself made no such distinctions.\n\nInstead, the man was merely out for revenge in its most vulgar and spiteful form. A mere two days later, on December 17, he proved it by suing Iowa pollster Ann Selzer for publishing a bad final poll. His logic there was equally as insane as in the CBS case: He claimed that since he “was always so popular,” Selzer must have conspired to alter her final Iowa results in order to dampen GOP enthusiasm in the state. (The statutory ground, amusingly enough, is claimed to be a violation of the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act.)\n\nOf course, the real purpose of the suit is to exhaust both parties’ financial resources with a full proctological discovery process on Selzer and the Des Moines Register, and Trump continues to pursue it doggedly. Just this week, Trump’s attorneys, fearing they had erred by filing their case in a federal court, attempted to drop and refile it on the state level; they intend to pursue this to the bitter end. And why not? Trump has all the resources in the world now — and he’s president of the United States.\n\nThis is a shameful milestone. Not just for CBS News — although I find it easy to see things from Paramount’s position, with $8 billion and the future of the company currently at stake — but for us all. Trump’s fiercest fans no doubt celebrated this week’s settlement, thrilled to see the liberal media once again humbled. But look beyond that, to the principle you are ratifying by cheering it: the use of gangster government methods of coercion, to extort money or speech from the enemies of whoever controls the presidency. And understand that one day, that enemy could easily be you.","summary":"This lawsuit was designed only to be used as a bludgeon, not to be won.","url":"https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/07/trumps-cbs-settlement-win-is-a-loss-for-america-not-just-the-media/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trumpw-white-house-press-room.jpg?fit=2057%2C1200&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-03 23:44:53","author":"Jeffrey Blehar","authors":["Jeffrey Blehar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":338025840,"title":"Trump enters his ‘Golden Age’ as bill passage caps long list of ‘remarkable’ accomplishments — wowing even critics","text":"WASHINGTON — President Trump is at the height of his political power following Thursday’s passage of his “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” – capping a remarkable two-week streak of domestic and foreign policy feats that even Democrats are calling impressive.\n\nTrump, 79, will sign the bill fulfilling his major campaign pledges – including to cut taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits – at a pre-fireworks Independence Day party on the White House lawn.\n\nB-2 stealth bombers will fly over the celebration in recognition of their role in the Trump-ordered June 21 US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear program, which was followed two days later by an equally unprecedented Trump-brokered cease-fire between Israel and Iran.\n\nThe commander in chief, riding high on that diplomatic coup, strong-armed NATO nations at the alliance’s annual conference to boost military spending to 5% of their GDP by 2035, after complaining for years that US allies were freeloading off American taxpayers.\n\nHe returned home to good news from the Supreme Court, which handed him wins on deporting illegal immigrants to third countries and restricting nationwide injunctions by district court judges — while CBS’s parent company agreed to fork over $16 million for deceptively editing an interview last year with Trump’s election rival, then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nOver the weekend, Canada scrapped a digital services tax against US internet giants under pressure from Trump, followed days later by the University of Pennsylvania stripping honors from transgender swimmer Lia Thomas and the announcement of a pending trade deal with Vietnam – as major stock market indices notched record highs and illegal border crossings hit new record lows.\n\nThe Big Beautiful Bill Act also includes $25 billion in funding for Trump’s “Golden Dome” missile defense program, spends more on immigration enforcement, allows tax deductions for domestic car loan interest and — in a major win for New York and New Jersey Republicans — lifts the cap on the amount of state and local taxes that can be deducted from federal returns to $40,000 from the prior $10,000.\n\n“I didn’t vote for him and I’m not always aligned with his approach, but his success on the domestic and international front in such a compressed period of time is nothing short of remarkable and it’s all due to his impressive use of political and executive power,” Michael LaRosa, a former Biden White House spokesman, told The Post.\n\n“The last two weeks of his presidency are a throwback to the strong leadership styles reminiscent of LBJ or Reagan, both of whom engendered such personal and political loyalty within their parties, that they could muscle through historic success out of sheer goodwill.”\n\nA different Biden White House official, who served all four years in the Democratic administration, said Trump has “hit a stride” and marveled at his ability to pressure holdout Republicans into voting for the major legislation despite centrist reluctance over Medicaid and SNAP cuts and conservative demands for deeper spending reductions.\n\n“You voted for it because you’re scared of the guy. And frankly, that’s impressive, given that Biden never invoked fear in anyone,” the former Biden aide said of the GOP holdouts, all but two of whom eventually backed the bill.\n\n“Successful campaigns and successful operations excel when they are provided clarity in mission from their leader — in this case President Trump,” said Chris LaCivita, who ran Trump’s 2024 campaign alongside current White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.\n\n“Elections matter because you now have one of the greatest realignments in political history happening and being backed up by policy. If you work, pay taxes and aspire for a better tomorrow, you are voting Republican,” LaCivita said, describing the working-class reforms encompassed in the bill, which also made permanent Trump’s 2017 tax cuts to all brackets. \n\n“If you’re dour, rich and generally hold people that don’t agree with [you] in contempt – and you don’t know what a woman is – you’re a Democrat. This transformation in political power is because of the leadership and determination of one person — President Trump.”\n\nKellyanne Conway, senior counselor to Trump during his first term, declared “these have been the most consequential two weeks of Trump’s second term, as he makes peace deals, trade deals and tax deals, everywhere all at once.”\n\n“And he’s just getting started. America is in its Golden Age,” Conway said.\n\n“The snark and bark of his petty critics is muted and meaningless. If you can’t beat him, join him. Sit back and enjoy a nation that is sovereign, secure and prosperous. We are the envy of the world and Trump is just getting started.”\n\n“President Trump is on a roll,” said Vivek Ramaswamy, the former Republican presidential candidate and current contender for Ohio governor. “By 2026, it will be up to the states to lead the way on other critical fronts, like solving the educational achievement crisis in our country.”\n\nTrump’s trail of triumphs precedes a significant deadline next week for the sealing of bilateral trade deals to avert “reciprocal” levies on foreign countries — which could dramatically increase US consumer costs and drive up inflation, which has cooled this year.\n\nTrump has given countries until July 9 to reach agreements to avert high rates, but thus far has only announced the outlines of deals with China, the UK and Vietnam, along with a “roadmap” with India.\n\nPublicly, the president has brushed off concern about the rate of dealmaking and said he will decree new rates when next week instead of pushing the deadline.\n\nTrump also has thus far failed to cajole Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell into lowering interest rates — causing the cost of homes, credit card balances and loans to remain high despite inflation nearing the Fed’s target of 2%.\n\nTrump has said he will allow Powell to remain in his role until his term expires next May, and that he intends to appoint a replacement who will promptly drop rates by at least 2 percentage points.\n\nBut for now, Trump’s series of successes offer momentum – with polling showing he’s getting credit for a strong economy, typically a top concern of voters, ahead of next year’s midterm election, which will determine whether the later half of his term is plagued by probes by congressional Democrats.\n\n“It’s becoming increasingly evident that Donald Trump is the dominant political figure so far of the 21st Century,” said American University professor Leonard Steinhorn, who teaches public communication and history courses.\n\nBut Steinhorn added that Trump’s administration contrasts with other powerful American presidents who – at least fleetingly – held broad-based national support. \n\n“As dominant as Donald Trump is today, he’s especially dominant over the Republican Party … But let’s not forget that he presides over half a country that believes that he is taking us on a very bad path, and to many people on a path to authoritarian or autocratic rule.”\n\nLaRosa, the former Biden White House aide, said he hopes that fellow Democrats will learn from Trump’s unexpected political abilities.\n\n“Even though I may disagree with him substantively, his effective use of power as an executive and party leader, despite congressional margins or ideological diversity, is something to admire for those of us who are practitioners of politics,” LaRosa said.\n\n“Instead of reflexively ridiculing his style and the fact that he uses the latitude he’s been afforded so skillfully, Democrats should learn from him and replicate it the next time we have the keys.”","summary":"President Trump is at the height of his political power following Thursday's passage of his “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/trump-in-midst-of-his-own-golden-age-as-list-of-remarkable-accomplishments-wows-critics/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/107571370.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/NNQR2YNT-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-03 22:40:33","author":"Steven Nelson","authors":["Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.39},{"id":338021160,"title":"World News | MAGA Faithful Cheer Trump for Pausing Ukraine Weapons After Bristling at Iran Strikes","text":"Washington, Jul 3 (AP) President Donald Trump is getting praise from his most ardent supporters for withholding some weapons from Ukraine after they recently questioned the Republican leader's commitment to keeping the US out of foreign conflicts. This week's announcement pausing deliveries of key air defence missiles, precision-guided artillery and other equipment to Ukraine comes just a few weeks after Trump ordered the US military to carry out strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Also Read | Donald Trump 'Big Beautiful' Bill Passed: House Gives Final Approval To Big Tax Bill, Sends It To Him To Sign. Bombing those sites in Iran had some hardcore supporters of the \"Make America Great Again\" movement openly questioning whether Trump was betraying his vow to keep America out of “stupid wars\" as he inserted the US military into Israel's conflict with Tehran. With the Ukraine pause, which affects a crucial resupply of Patriot missiles, Trump is sending the message to his most enthusiastic backers that he is committed to following through on his campaign pledge to wind down American support for Ukraine's efforts to repel Russia, a conflict he has repeatedly described as a costly boondoggle for US taxpayers.

Caldwell publicly worried before the Iran strikes that US involvement could incite a major war and ultimately cost American lives. Far-right influencer Jack Posobiec, another ardent MAGA backer, warned as Trump weighed whether to carry out strikes on Iran last month that such a move “would disastrously split the Trump coalition.\" He was quick to cheer the news about pausing some weapons deliveries to Ukraine: “America FIRST,\" Posobiec posted on X. Trump weighed in on the pause for the first time Thursday, justifying the move as necessary. He said former President Joe Biden “emptied out our whole country giving them weapons, and we have to make sure that we have enough for ourselves.” “We've given so many weapons,” Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One for a flight to Iowa. He added that “we are working with them and trying to help them.” Meanwhile, White House and the Pentagon officials said the move is consistent with Trump's campaign pledge to limit US involvement in foreign wars. “The president was elected on an America first platform to put America first,” Pentagon chief spokesman Sean Parnell said. At the same time, the decision is stirring anxiety among those in the more hawkish wing of the Republican Party. Many are flummoxed by Trump's halting the flow of US arms just as Russia accelerates its unrelenting assault on Ukraine. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican who hails from a district that former Vice President Kamala Harris won in 2024, wrote to Trump and the Pentagon on Wednesday expressing “serious concern” about the decision and requesting an emergency briefing. “We can't let (Russian President Vladimir) Putin prevail now. President Trump knows that too and it's why he's been advocating for peace,” Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, wrote on X. “Now is the time to show Putin we mean business. And that starts with ensuring Ukraine has the weapons Congress authorized to pressure Putin to the negotiating table.” Trump spoke by phone with Putin on Thursday, the sixth call between the leaders since Trump's return to office. The leaders discussed Iran, Ukraine and other issues but did not specifically address the suspension of some US weapons shipments to Ukraine, according to Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign affairs adviser. Zelenskyy said in Denmark after meeting with major European Union backers that he hopes to talk to Trump in the coming days about the suspension. The administration says it is part of global review of the US stockpile and is a necessary audit after sending nearly USD 70 billion in arms to Ukraine since Putin launched the war on Ukraine in February 2022. The pause was coordinated by Pentagon policy chief Elbridge Colby. Colby, before taking his position, spoke publicly about the need to focus US strategy more on China, widely seen as the United States' biggest economic and military competitor. At his Senate confirmation hearing in March, he said the US doesn't have a “multi-war military.” “This is the restrainers like Colby flexing their muscle and saying, Hey, the Pacific is more important,'” said retired Navy Adm. Mark Montgomery, an analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. Backers of a more restrained US foreign policy say the move is necessary, given an unsettled Middle East, rising challenges in Asia and the stress placed on the US defence industrial complex after more than three years of war in Ukraine. “You're really coming up to the point where continuing to provide aid to Ukraine is putting at risk the US ability to operate in future crises,” said Jennifer Kavanagh, a senior fellow and director of military analysis at Defense Priorities. “And you don't know when those crises are going to happen.\" \"So you have to be a little bit cautious,” she added.

This list reflects a broad spectrum of public figures, including political commentators, journalists, comedians and actors. \n\nWhile true crime, interviews and fiction remain staples, a growing podcast subgenre is the “behind-the-scenes” content, which could be particularly relevant to entertainment platforms like Netflix. These shows, hosted by original cast members, revisit beloved series with anecdotes and insider stories. The popularity of this category underscores the long-tail value of high-engagement IP.\n\nShows like “The Office,” “Glee,” “One Tree Hill” and “The O.C.” are examples of this format, serving as the central theme for podcasts hosted by their original cast members. “Office Ladies,” for instance, is hosted by Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey, who played Pam and Angela on “The Office.” \n\nAccording to Parrot Analytics’ Streaming Economics model, the TV show generated more than an estimated $120 million in streaming revenue contribution only in the UCAN (United States and Canada) region over the past five years, a notable figure considering its final episode aired in 2013. This sustained value highlights the wide range of opportunities that a multi-million-dollar IP can continue to unlock over time.\n\nThis strategic opportunity extends beyond nostalgia. High-profile actors like Amy Poehler and Julia Louis-Dreyfus are turning to podcasts as a space for creative expansion, far from the traditional routes once limited to late-night talk shows or guest appearances. From a streaming platform perspective, these ventures could offer more than just visibility. \n\nConsidering the performance of “Parks and Recreation” and “Seinfeld,” popular series led by Poehler and Louis-Dreyfus, respectively, both demonstrated high retention value on streaming platforms. On Peacock, 80% of the users associated with “Parks and Recreation’s” revenue contribution in the UCAN region over the last four years were retained users. “Seinfeld” performed even higher, with over 90% of its equivalent users being retained users on Netflix. These numbers reflect not only the enduring appeal of legacy titles, but also the audience stickiness that comes with familiar, beloved talent.\n\nIn this context, podcasts can serve as a powerful retention lever, either by leveraging pre-existing communities from digital natives like Alex Cooper, reigniting fan engagement with iconic IPs, or by offering new creative vehicles for actors already associated with high-performing content. As streaming platforms navigate an increasingly competitive landscape, podcasts might be a possibility to extend the lifecycle of premium IP, and keep subscribers meaningfully engaged within their content ecosystems.","summary":"Parrot Analytics data unpacks how talent-driven behind-the-scenes podcasts are extending IP value\n\n\nThe post How Podcasts Became Hollywood&#8217;s Next Retention Strategy | Charts appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/how-podcasts-became-hollywoods-next-retention-strategy-charts/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/office-ladies-podcasts.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-03 22:31:22","author":"Jenna Fischer,Lucas Mascarenhas","authors":["Jenna Fischer","Lucas Mascarenhas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.771},{"id":338012458,"title":"Trump-Endorsed MAGA Candidate for Karoline Leavitt’s Role Revealed – Here’s Why Her History Blocked Her Selection","text":"PRESIDENT Donald Trump might have suggested someone else for Karoline Leavitt’s position, according to a bombshell report.\n\nBefore 27-year-old Leavitt stepped up as the White House press secretary, there were reports that Trump considered a different candidate known for their controversial right-wing views.\n\nThe president initially considered MAGA enthusiast Laura Loomer, 32, for the role, according to a new book written by journalists Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager, and Isaac Arnsdorf.\n\n2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America outlines Trump’s journey to reclaiming the presidency for a second term, as reported by the Daily Mail.\n\nWhen Trump considered who would face the media in his White House briefing room, he reportedly had Loomer, a conservative influencer known for spreading conspiracy theories, at the top of his list.\n\n“Many of Trump’s advisers viewed Loomer as too-conspiracy-minded and pugilistic, but he liked her,” the book said.\n\nThe book also says Trump once asked his advisers, “Is she too fringe to be press secretary?”\n\nTrump’s advisers clearly talked him down from the decision as he announced Leavitt would be taking on the role after election day.\n\nLoomer previously said she wasn’t officially joining Trump’s team and would only join him at certain events “as a guest.”\n\nSome of Trump’s allies distanced themselves from Loomer due to her inflammatory rhetoric, including when she posted a vile “good riddance” message after a Democratic congresswoman died last year.\n\nTrump publicly disagreed with Loomer after she launched racist attacks on Kamala Harris during her presidential run against Trump last year.\n\nDuring Harris’ campaign, Loomer wrote that if Harris beat out Trump for president, “the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.”\n\nHarris is biracial.

She recommended certain people for jobs.”\n\nTrump announced Leavitt’s appointment in November after she worked as the national press secretary throughout his 2024 campaign.\n\n“Karoline is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator,” Trump said in a statement at the time.\n\n“I have the utmost confidence she will excel at the podium and help deliver our message to the American people.”\n\nThe Trump administration didn’t immediately return The U.S. Sun’s request for comment.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPRESIDENT Donald Trump might have suggested someone else for Karoline Leavitt&#8217;s position,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump-Endorsed MAGA Candidate for Karoline Leavitt&#8217;s Role Revealed &#8211; Here&#8217;s Why Her History Blocked Her Selection first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-endorsed-maga-candidate-for-karoline-leavitts-role-revealed-heres-why-her-history-blocked-her-selection/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MAGA-firebrand-who-Donald-Trump-touted-for-Karoline-Leavitts-job.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-03 21:57:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":338006456,"title":"Congress passed no tax on tips in Trump's 'big, beautiful bill.' Here's how it works","text":"Tipped workers in the U.S. could see significant changes to their taxes after Congress approved President Trump's legislative agenda on Thursday. This week, the GOP-controlled Senate and House narrowly passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — a massive spending and tax package that creates limited and temporary tax exemptions for tips, among other tax cuts. \n\nOnce the provision goes into effect, workers will be able to deduct $25,000 in tips annually from their taxable income. After that, tips will be federally taxed. \n\n\"If you look at the data on tipped income, that would cover the majority of individuals earning tips in the United States,\" said Garrett Watson of the Tax Foundation, an organization that advocates for simplifying the tax code in pursuit of economic growth. \"So, it's still pretty generous for most workers.\" \n\nIf a worker makes more than $150,000 a year, though, their tipped income will start to be taxed. \n\n\"That helps to sort of carve out some of the very high earners who may be incentivized to recharacterize their income tips inappropriately,\" Watson said. \n\nA chief concerns among tax experts during the campaign was that hedge fund managers and lawyers would turn themselves into \"tipped workers\" in order to skirt federal taxes altogether. \n\nThe package also restricts tax-free tips to worker at \"an occupation which customarily and regularly received tips\" — but the text does not define these jobs individually. \n\n\"It will ultimately fall, at the end of the day, to Treasury and the IRS administers and for this consistent with the language,\" Watson said. \n\nThe law, if not extended by Congress at a later date, will phase out at the end of 2028 — near the end of Trump's presidency.\n\nA political promise kept\n\nTrump campaigned heavily on the \"no taxes on tips\" policy during the 2024 presidential race. In June, Trump said he got the idea from a Las Vegas tipped-worker. By August, former Vice President Kamala Harris also campaigned on eliminating taxes on tips. \n\nWith the bill heading to the the president's desk, tipped workers could see their federal taxes shrink \"as soon as later this year\" depending on the speed of the IRS and Treasury Department, according to Watson.\n\n\"Especially going into next season, folks will see that adjustment in their taxes and a potential refund for any withholding on that tipped income,\" Watson said. \n\nThe \"no tax on tips\" idea had bipartisan supporters in Congress including Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., and Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev.\n\nIn addition to disagreements over the specifics of the no-tax-on-tips policy, Democrats in Congress universally opposed the package, largely citing cuts to Medicaid. A government analysis predicts the law will strip health insurance from more than ten million Americans over the next decade.\n\n\"There is no spin for the human suffering they're causing,\" Horsford said in a statement Thursday. \"This is Robin Hood in reverse, and Republicans would be wise to remember that they won't have the last word here — the American people will, on Election Day.\"\n\nOn Monday, Horsford offered an amendment to make no taxes on tips permanent, instead of temporary. His amendment failed.\n\nBuchanan, though, celebrated the policy's passage. \"The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is the definition of promises made and promises kept,\" he said in statement to NPR Thursday. \n\nWhat does no taxes on tips mean for Americans? \n\nWhile it dominated the campaign and messaging from the Trump White House, Executive Director at the Yale Budget Lab Martha Gimbel — a former Biden administration official — said she doesn't think this law will have a significant impact on American workers and wages. \n\n\"Overall, tipped work is a really small sliver of the labor market,\" Gimbel said. \"It's about two and a half percent of all employment.\"\n\nMoreover, Gimbel said the policy won't affect the taxes of lower-income tipped workers. \n\n\"Very low income Americans are not going to benefit from this, largely because they already have little to no taxable income,\" Gimbel said. \"And so what you are largely seeing is that this provision will benefit people who are in the middle, upper-middle income brackets.\" \n\nGimbel said middle-class tipped workers and their employers will reap the most benefits and may take advantage of the new tax exemption. \n\n\"Let's take a hairdresser,\" Gimbel said. \"It would be very plausible to me that they might lower the cost of a haircut, but say that they expect the tips to go up. We'll see in years to come if that happens.\" \n\nFor Gimbel, the no tax on tips law should be taken in the broader context of the entire bill. \n\n\"Our analysis suggests that if your income is above 3.3 million, you get a tax cut of over 118 thousand,\" Gimbel said. \"And if you're in the bottom quintile, once SNAP and Medicaid cuts are taken into account, on average, you're losing $560.\"\n\n\"It's a really regressive bill and it's incredibly expensive,\" she said. \n\nWhat should tipped workers do now? \n\nTipped workers should wait for more guidance from the IRS and the Treasury Department, Watson said. \n\nOnce new guidance is released, tipped workers could update their W-4 withholdings to reflect the newly tax-exempt tips. Or workers can wait for a refund when they file in the spring. \n\n\"I do expect for a lot of folks to use software,\" Watson said. \"This will be quickly incorporated into next year's filing season and will be something that's that's asked for. But that's always something to watch for as well, just to make sure it's properly accounted for.\"\n\nWatson also noted that many tipped workers hold multiple jobs. He cautioned these workers that only $25,000 of their annual tips will be tax free — even across multiple tipped jobs.","summary":"Congress passed the tax cut and spending megabill with President Trump's legislative priorities which includes new tax exemptions for tipped hourly workers.

Both Community Hospital and Curtis Medical Center are located in Nebraska's 3rd Congressional District, which Trump carried by more than 50 points in the November general election.Trump won 76.3 percent of the general election vote in the district, compared to then-Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris's 22.5 percent.The Republican congressman who represents the district, Adrian Smith, voted to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on Thursday.Smith celebrated the bill's passage, saying in a statement: \"Getting our work done on this legislation is a game changer for American workers, families, and our nation's long-term fiscal outlook. It not only prevents severe tax hikes and expands tax relief for family farms, small businesses, and middle-class Americans, it strengthens essential Farm Bill programs.\"What People Are SayingSmith said in his statement Thursday: \"[The bill] also ensures public assistance programs remain sustainable for the neediest Americans and empowers the Trump administration to keep our communities safe. I championed provisions in the package which will empower parents with educational choice, support biofuels producers and energy affordability, and boost growth for capital-intensive industries such as manufacturing. After years of work in the Ways and Means Committee and months of intense debate across both the House and the Senate, this bill will catalyze President Trump's plan to energize our economy and get our country back on track.\"What Happens NextThe Curtis Medical Center is expected to wind down its operations in the next few months.

Arm-twisting from Trump and last-minute benefits targeting specific states cajoled holdouts, despite conservative misgivings over transformative cuts to Medicaid and the ballooning deficit.\n\nHere’s the journey of the sprawling tax-and-spending bill.\n\nThe first hurdle\n\nThe initial version of the mega-bill passed by the House in May extended tax cuts from 2017.\n\nIt also increased the debt limit by about $4tn, and added billions in spending on immigration enforcement while adding work requirements to Medicaid and requiring states to contribute more to Snap nutrition assistance. The Budget Lab at Yale estimated the House bill would add $2.4tn to the debt over the 2025-34 period.\n\nSeveral conservative Republicans balked at several aspects of the bill during long debate sessions. Mike Lawler, a congressman representing New York, wanted a larger Salt deduction – which concerns offsetting state and local taxes – while the California congressman David Valadao was concerned about the Medicaid cuts, which his district heavily relies on for healthcare.\n\nThen Trump traveled to Capitol Hill in late May to help assuage the holdouts. At his meeting with lawmakers, “he was emphatic [that] we need to quit screwing around. That was the clear message. You all have tinkered enough – it is time to land the plane,” the South Dakota congressman Dusty Johnson told reporters.\n\n“Ninety-eight per cent of that conference is ready to go. They were enthused. They were pumped up by the president, and I think with the holdouts, he did move them. I don’t know that we are there yet, but that was a hugely impactful meeting.”\n\nIn the end, there were only two House Republicans who voted against the bill: Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio, both of whom are fiscal hawks concerned about the federal deficit. The bill moved on to the Senate.\n\nThe bill lands in the Senate\n\nThe Senate version of the budget bill passed on a 50-50 vote with JD Vance, the vice-president, breaking the tie. Until the final stages, however, all eyes were on the Republican senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, both noted moderates, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky, both noted fiscal conservatives.\n\nThe bill’s authors added tax provisions to benefit Alaska’s whaling industry to win the support of Murkowski. They also tried to add provisions protecting rural hospitals from Medicaid cuts in “non-contiguous states”, but the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the amendments would violate restrictions on what the bill could contain without triggering the 60-vote filibuster.\n\nMurkowski acquiesced after winning new tax revenues from oil and gas drilling leases for Alaska, provisions protecting clean energy tax credits, and delays on Snap changes.\n\n“Do I like this bill? No,” Murkowski said as she stared down an NBC reporter who had just relayed a comment by the Kentucky Republican Rand Paul describing her vote as “a bailout for Alaska at the expense of the rest of the country”.\n\nOther changes to the Senate bill were made in the final days of negotiations, including the striking of a 10-year federal ban on state regulation of AI. A record number of amendments were proposed.\n\nTillis, who announced he would not run again in his politically competitive state, gave a rousing speech about the perils of Medicaid cuts and voted against the bill. Collins and Paul remained in opposition.\n\nWith few other options, Democrats tried to delay the vote by requiring the entire bill to be read out loud on the floor the night before the vote.\n\nBut in the end, with Murkowski’s vote, the Senate had a tie, allowing Vance to cast the deciding vote.\n\nThe last mile\n\nGiven the total opposition of Democrats to the bill’s passage, Republicans in the House could lose no more than three of their own to get the bill to the finish line.\n\nOn Wednesday, the last push still felt dubious. Even the procedural vote that is required to move to an actual vote was delayed for hours, as some Republicans considering holding their vote.\n\nRalph Norman of South Carolina told C-Span after voting against the bill in committee that he opposed the Senate version’s inclusion of tax credits for renewable energy and its failure to restrict Chinese investment in American property.\n\n“We have one chance, one moment to curb the spending that has plagued this country and will take this country down if we don’t get it under control,” he said. “What I see right now, I don’t like.”\n\nVictoria Spartz of Indiana had withheld support over concerns about increases in the federal debt.\n\n“I’ll vote for the bill, since we need to make it happen for our economy & there are some good provisions in it. However, I will vote against the rule due to broken commitments by Speaker Johnson to his own members,” she wrote on X on Wednesday. “I’m on Plan C now to deal with the looming fiscal catastrophe.”\n\nSpartz referred to a promise Johnson made to fiscal conservatives that he would not bring a budget bill to a vote if it increased the debt beyond a certain amount. Spartz said this bill exceeded the agreed-upon amount by about $500bn.\n\nShortly before midnight there were five Republicans voting no on the procedural rule. But deals were still being made – executive orders promised and other negotiations done on the floor.\n\nOnce again Trump stepped in, joining the speaker, Mike Johnson, in coaxing the party members to cast their final approval. The president called several House members and posted on his Truth Social account. “What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT’S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!” he wrote early on Thursday morning.\n\nJohnson held the vote open for seven hours, the longest vote recorded. And it worked. On Thursday morning, Norman voted yes to advance the bill.\n\nSo did Andrew Clyde of Georgia, a notable second amendment rights activist in Congress, who failed in his push for an amendment to the bill to remove the registration requirement for firearms suppressors, short-barreled rifles and short-barreled shotguns from the National Firearms Act, creating a path for legal civilian use without registration and paying a federal tax.\n\nThe holdouts fell into line, and the House voted early on Thursday morning 219-213 in a procedural vote to move forward.\n\nThere was still a way to go. Johnson had expected to open the vote at 8am. But the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, commandeered the dais for more than eight hours – setting a record previously held by the Republican Kevin McCarthy – in a marathon stemwinder of a speech attacking the perils of the legislation and delaying the vote.\n\nBut Johnson remained confident after a night of promises and threats.\n\nMassie remained the face of conservative holdouts on the bill. He has faced withering personal attacks from Trump on social media, the creation of a Super Pac to fund a primary challenge and local advertisements attacking his stance on the bill.\n\nIn the end it was only Massie and Brian Fitzpatrick, a congressman in Pennsylvania who voted for Kamala Harris last year, who voted against a bill that will now rewrite the American political landscape.","summary":"With narrow majorities and intra-party splits, Republicans faced a battle to give Trump his bill to sign – but they did it\n\nJust a few months ago, analysts predicted that Republicans in Congress – with their narrow majorities and fractured internal dynamics – would not be able to pass Donald Trump’s landmark legislation.\n\nOn Thursday, the president’s commanding influence over his party was apparent once again: the bill passed just in time for Trump’s Fourth of July deadline.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/03/how-republicans-passed-big-beautiful-bill-trump","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aea36ed03b4d13cfff72bc20adb39dd69e4c9ecc/484_0_4335_3467/master/4335.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-03 21:16:02","author":"George Chidi","authors":["George Chidi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":338005352,"title":"Chris Cuomo continues one-sided feud against AOC, suggests she’s to blame for ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ passing","text":"NewsNation anchor Chris Cuomo continues to take personal swipes at Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, this time suggesting that the progressive lawmaker is to blame for Donald Trump’s Medicaid-slashing megabill passing on Thursday.\n\nWith the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” passing the House after several Republican hardliners switched their votes overnight to clear a key procedural hurdle following some last-minute arm-twisting by Donald Trump, Ocasio-Cortez took aim at Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) for bemoaning her own vote for the legislation.\n\n“This isn’t about you,” the New York congresswoman tweeted on Thursday morning. “This is about the 17 million Americans whose health insurance you’re taking away.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez, who delivered an emotional House floor speech on Wednesday slamming the spending bill as a “deal with the devil,” further tore into Murkowski for urging House Republicans to vote against the legislation after paving the way for its passage in the Senate. \n\n“Americans are going to suffer. YOU admit that.

But in a final deal made to appeal to conservatives, the legislation struck the term “for minors.” \n\nRepublicans passed the legislation via the process of budget reconciliation, which allowed them to avoid a Democratic filibuster. But that meant the legislation had to relate to federal spending and the Senate Parliamentarian, who determines whether legislative language complies with the so-called “Byrd Rule” criteria found it was not germane. \n\nInitially, the Senate version included similar language. But the parliamentarian found that it did not comply with the Byrd Rule after Democratic staff argued for it. \n\nStill, Republicans included it in the language of the text they hoped to put on the floor. That would have required Democrats to raise a point of order on the legislation, which would mean the amendment would need 60 votes and the 53 Republican senators would need to pick off seven Democrats.\n\nRep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) said he thought that would be an easy fight. \n\n“It’s a good bet to take,” he said on X. \n\n“For one thing, nothing to lose so why not try? But second, I believe the Democrats won’t want to pick this battle. This is a very very popular provision. I think the Democrats know they’ve lost the battle. The science isn’t on their side and neither is the public.” \n\nBut transgender people had a powerful ally in Sen. Ron Wyden, one of the remaining lawmakers who opposed the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, the law that made the federal government recognize marriage as one man and one woman. Wyden said at the time that he would raise a point of order if needed. \n\n“I was first senators come out and support marriage equality and I said if you don't like gay marriage, don't get one,” the Oregon Democrat told The Independent. \n\n“This is the same thing. This is a private choice for adults should be blankship belong to them.”\n\nAccording to the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, about 276,000 transgender adults use Medicaid. But Republicans have focused heavily on anti-trans rhetoric and policy, with numerous state legislatures enacting bans on gender-affirming care for youth with gender dysphoria.\n\nIn addition, late last year, House Republicans included a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act that banned TRICARE, the health care program for active-duty military servicemembers, from covering “certain medical procedures for children that could result in sterilization.” \n\nIn 2024, the Trump campaign ran an advertisement criticizing his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris for allowing taxpayer-funded gender-affirming surgeries for undocumented immigrants in prison, famously using the tagline: “Kamala is for They/Them” while “President Trump is for you.” \n\nIn the end, the final agreement that led to the legislation being passed in the Senate excluded the language on gender-affirming care without the Democrats having to raise a point of order.\n\nRep. Mark Takano of California, the chairman of the Congressional Equality Caucus, heralded the win for transgender people, saying that the four big fights for them are access to medical care, freedom from bullying and harassment at school, freedom from harassment at the workplace and the ability to participate in sports. \n\n“The fact that this was achieved in the Senate, rather painlessly, was a was a pretty remarkable time of events,” Takano told The Independent. \n\nInitially, it looked like Republicans would want to include amendments to the Senate version. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene proposed an amendment to restore the ban. But Republicans opted to pass the legislation without amendments, meaning the language was not included in the final bill. \n\nBefore the final House bill’s passage, Rep. Sarah McBride of Delaware praised the fact the language died. \n\n“I think there are a lot of people who are rightfully relieved,” she said.","summary":"‘I think there are a lot of people who are rightfully relieved,’ Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender member of congress, tells The Independent","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/transgender-medicaid-ban-trump-spending-bill-b2781844.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/03/10/54/GettyImages-2219152313.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/5GLIz138-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-03 20:58:23","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.358},{"id":338010076,"title":"Don't Worry, John Dickerson: CBS News Lost The Public's Trust Long Before Settlement With Trump","text":"On Thursday night, \"CBS Evening News\" anchor John Dickerson addressed the fact that parent company Paramount Global reached a $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump over the network's deceptive editing during an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 election. \"Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS News, settled a suit with President Trump today. Journalists don’t like to report on themselves. Sometimes that’s false humility. Mostly, it’s a practical limitation. Reporters try to find order in chaos. We prefer to explain the cause of a bombing, the intent of a bill, the marvel of a new discovery. Putting chaos in preliminary order helps viewers make sense of their world. They tell us this at airports, restaurants, and at church. The audience brings us their fears, their questions, their good faith view of things. It reminds us that we are stewards of that concern. It’s a grace to receive another’s trust, but also to have a mission that shapes your work,\" Dickerson began. \"Can you hold power to account after paying it millions? Can an audience trust you when it thinks you've traded away that trust?\" he asked. \"The audience will decide.\" The audience will decide. In terms of CBS News, the audience has already decided. \"CBS Evening News\" has been a distant third in the evening news wars for over a decade. But the show has never been less competitive with its ABC and NBC counterparts than it is today. Last week, CBS drew just 3.8 million viewers during the 6:30 pm news hour, compared to 7.3 million for ABC and 5.7 million for NBC. However, we don't put the onus entirely on John Dickerson or his co-host, some guy named Maurice DuBois. See, CBS News butchered its trust with the audience long before settling with Donald Trump. CBS News is as guilty as any news outlet in America of feeding its audiences politically-motivated lies to either cost Trump the election or damage his reputation publicly. The news operation was complicit in the Russia Hoax, the Biden cover-up, the \"bloodbath\" hoax, the \"very fine people\" hoax, and the Hunter Biden laptop was part of a Russian disinformation operation hoax, etc., etc., etc. Moreover, \"60 Minutes\" is a shell of itself. In addition to editing its interview with Kamala Harris, CBS's flagship news program recently fawned over censorship laws in Germany, downplayed how Hamas treated hostages, and broke format to editorialize about Trump's then-Cabinet nominations. Spoiler: CBS disapproved of his picks. Just last month, CBS News cited a misleading study that claimed \"one out of every 15 American adults has been at a mass shooting.\" In actuality, the referenced study simply found that one in 15 of the 10,000 respondents asked said they had \"heard\" gunshots from an incident they think involved more than four people. Nonetheless, CBS cited the study as evidence that the country ought to implement stricter gun laws. There was also the CBS News-led vice presidential debate last October, during which moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan repeatedly interrupted J.D. Vance with misleading fact checks while letting Tampon Tim spread lies about the Trump administration's first term. But, yeah, settling with Trump is what will cause Americans to lose trust in CBS News.","summary":"John Dickerson addressed parent company Paramount Global reaching a $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/dont-worry-john-dickerson-cbs-news-lost-publics-trust-long-before-settlement-trump","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/07/gettyimages-1229297602.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-03 20:57:52","author":"Bobby Burack","authors":["Bobby Burack"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.344},{"id":338270004,"title":"Albanese’s plan to ‘unleash the private sector’","text":"ALBO’S VISION\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese will today set out the economic vision for his second term in office, calling for big employers and small businesses to “resume your rightful place as the primary source of growth in our economy”.\n\nAlbanese will address the annual Australia’s Economic Outlook event in Sydney, hosted by The Australian and Sky News, later and according to the newspaper, will “acknowledge government ‘doing less’ would unleash the private sector”.\n\nWith his economic reform roundtable happening next month, the PM will today reportedly call for cooperation across sectors to help increase productivity and allow the private sector to increase investment, jobs and economic growth.\n\n“This is not a task government can, or should, tackle alone. In a strong, dynamic and -productive economy, government should be a driver of growth — but not the driver of growth. -Facilitating private sector investment and job creation, not seeking to replace it,” Albanese is expected to say.\n\n“From big employers to the millions of small businesses right around Australia, our government wants you to be able to resume your rightful place as the primary source of growth in our economy.”\n\nThe Australian adds that the PM’s economic vision for the next three years includes the aforementioned productivity increase, embracing new technologies, modernising the economy, progressing tax reform, cutting red tape and removing overlapping state and federal laws.\n\nElsewhere, Guardian Australia reports Liberal frontbencher Melissa McIntosh has called for the opposition party to consider gender-balanced candidate pools as an alternative to quotas.\n\nThe site reports McIntosh wrote to the NSW Women’s Council president Berenice Walker, calling for the discussion on increasing the number of women in the party to not be reduced to a yes or no on quotas.\n\n“Strong systems help open the door, but it is the party’s culture that determines whether women stay, thrive, and reach the heights of leadership and success,” McIntosh, the shadow women’s minister, said. “A structural redesign might consider gender-balanced candidate pools to ensure equality of opportunity — consistent with our values — rather than prescribing outcomes.”\n\nMeanwhile, even though we’ve all heard enough of US President Donald Trump this week (and every week), the likes of the ABC and Guardian Australia still want more and have been leading their coverage this morning on the fact Congress has passed his controversial spending bill.\n\nCHILDCARE SAFETY LAWS\n\nNew childcare safety laws are set to be introduced to federal parliament in the first sitting week of the new term later this month. Guardian Australia reports Education Minister Jason Clare will bring forward the legislation as the government looks to fast-track changes designed to strengthen regulatory and enforcement powers.\n\nThe site says the new laws “would prevent providers that are persistently failing to meet minimum standards from opening new centres, and cut off childcare subsidy funding for repeat offender operators and those guilty of egregious breaches”.\n\nThe AAP says state and federal ministers have been scrambling to fast-track childcare sector reforms “after it was revealed on Tuesday a Melbourne carer was charged with more than 70 sex offences. Joshua Dale Brown allegedly abused eight children aged under two at a Point Cook facility in the city’s southwest from April 2022 to January 2023.”\n\nThe ABC reports Brown, 26, was not known to police and had a valid Working with Children Check, which has since been cancelled.\n\nGuardian Australia highlights Victorian Minister for Children Lizzie Blandthorn has criticised the “frustratingly slow” progress on national reforms, as well as the lack of federal funding for state regulators.\n\nSpeaking to Channel Seven’s Sunrise on Thursday, Clare conceded: “We all agree it’s taken too bloody long, and we’re determined to act here.” Senior frontbencher Clare O’Neil also said she didn’t have a good answer for why the previous royal commission’s recommendations of streamlining checks hadn’t been implemented, AAP says\n\nThe proposed legislation would include new powers of entry, allowing authorised officers under the Family Assistance Law to conduct spot checks and make unannounced visits at centres, Guardian Australia adds.\n\nThe Nine papers highlight Clare said yesterday the earliest the changes, which may also include a national system of checks for people working with children, could be implemented was September.\n\nSpeaking to the ABC’s 7.30 he also said the penalties centres face for failing to meet standards were insufficient. “Any right-minded person that finds out a maximum penalty for an individual is $9,000, a centre or provider, $45,000, [would say] that’s probably not enough,” he said. “The question is, how do you make sure you hit those quality and safety standards? What do businesses in this sector listen to? Money. If you cut off the funding, then you end up closing down the centre.”\n\nHe also conceded ministers, including himself, had failed to bring about changes quickly enough. “I take my fair share of responsibility for it,” he said. “We’ve got to do everything that we possibly can to make sure our children are safe.”\n\nThe ABC says the issue is set to be on the agenda at a meeting of attorneys-general next month.\n\nThe Age highlights Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan has also appointed former premier of South Australia Jay Weatherill, and chair of the Victorian Registration and Qualifications Authority Pamela White, to conduct an urgent review of childcare safety. The review is due to report back by August 15.\n\nON A LIGHTER NOTE…\n\nThe city of Shepparton in Victoria is generating plenty of headlines at the moment due to its proposal to build the biggest pear on the planet. Guardian Australia reports the city wants to construct the three-storey fibreglass fruit in the heart of the Goulburn Valley at a cost of at least $1.3 million.\n\nSteering group spokesperson, Rocky Varapodio, said of the plans: “What we would really like to achieve out of this is for it to be a structure that is in the shape of the pear, and look[s] like a pear, that will symbolise fruit growing in the region.\n\n“But, more importantly, we want it to be a really good experience when you enter into the pear — we want you to have an exceptional, interactive experience.”\n\nUniversity of the Sunshine Coast’s associate dean Dr Amy Clarke said creating the big pear would be “difficult to achieve from an engineering and architecture perspective”, but “pretty spectacular” if successfully done.\n\nA 16-metre-long Murray cod was also recently unveiled 20 minutes south of Shepparton. “I think that — if they go down the road that that artistic impression is suggesting they might — they’re in the running to have that title of capital of big things in Australia,” Clarke added.\n\nAny music performances deemed high risk will now not be broadcast live or streamed live.BBC\n\nThe broadcaster announced a change to its broadcast strategy in the wake of punk duo Bob Vylan’s Glastonbury performance.\n\nCRIKEY RECAP\n\nREAD ALL ABOUT IT\n\n ‘A gift to the people of Victoria’: Here’s what mob think of Yoorrook’s truth findings (NITV)\n\n‘A friend to everyone’: Liverpool manager Arne Slot remembers Diogo Jota after death in car crash (BBC)\n\nMichael Madsen, who starred in Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill, dies aged 67 (Sky News)\n\nPentagon says US strikes delayed Iran’s nuclear program by up to two years (The Wall Street Journal)\n\nSix reasons why Trump can’t stop winning (Daily Beast)\n\nCrete wildfire forces 1,500 to evacuate as Europe heatwave continues (The Guardian)\n\nTHE COMMENTARIAT\n\nHow two once hot-button issues this week barely sparked media and political interest — Michelle Grattan (The Conversation): Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s decision last year to put Burke into Home Affairs was something of a political masterstroke. If Clare O’Neil and Andrew Giles had still been in their former respective portfolios of Home Affairs and Immigration, the present failure to deal more successfully with the former detainees would have been a much bigger issue. Burke is skilled at throwing a blanket over contentious areas.\n\nOn the other side of politics, James Paterson was moved out of Home Affairs to become shadow finance minister in Sussan Ley’s reshuffle. Paterson pursued the former immigration detainees relentlessly. The new spokesmen, Andrew Hastie (Home Affairs) and Paul Scarr (Immigration), haven’t hit their strides yet, and what they have said on the issue hasn’t grabbed much attention.\n\nParamount betrays ‘60 Minutes’ and the rest of us – Erik Wemple (The Washington Post): On November 3, a top lawyer for CBS News wrote to a lawyer representing Donald Trump in a baseless suit against CBS News. “We urge your client to voluntarily dismiss the complaint for the reasons set out below and, should he refuse to do so,” wrote the CBS News lawyer, “we reserve the right to seek sanctions and damages against him.”\n\nOn Tuesday night came the news that Paramount had agreed to pay $16 million to settle the suit, which stemmed from a 60 Minutes interview with then-vice president and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. The money, which covers the president’s legal fees and costs, will go to his future presidential library.","summary":"The prime minister wants small business to become the driver of the economy as his government looks to increase productivity, and new childcare safety laws will be introduced in the first week of federal parliament.\n\n\nThe post Albanese&#8217;s plan to &#8216;unleash the private sector&#8217; appeared first on Crikey.","url":"https://www.crikey.com.au/2025/07/04/anthony-albanese-productivity-private-sector-childcare-safety-laws/","image":"https://www.crikey.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/albo.jpg?quality=70&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-03 20:55:58","author":"Rich James","authors":["Rich James"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.319},{"id":338001810,"title":"Paramount’s $16 Million Settlement With Trump Sends a Chilling Message","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nSome good news for David Zaslav: As of this week, it seems there may be another entertainment executive who’s more widely loathed than the Warner Bros. Discovery CEO. Some bad news for the rest of us: The woman who’s taken that ignominious crown, Paramount Global owner Shari Redstone, has further endangered the United States’ already crumbling democracy in the process.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Paramount’s co-CEO George Cheeks (yes, that’s his name) had the unenviable task of explaining to shareholders why the entertainment giant—which owns CBS, among several other prominent TV assets—had chosen to settle a lawsuit brought by President Donald Trump over an October 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris that, he’d baselessly claimed, had been edited to make her sound better. “Yes, the company has agreed in principle to settle the lawsuit, and as reported, it does not include an apology,” Cheeks huffed to the investors, according to the Hollywood Reporter. “Look, companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable cost of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial as well as reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations.”\n\nThat’s a long way of saying: We chickened out so we could get a deal. The long-struggling Paramount has been hoping to get bought out for a while now—preferably by the production giant Skydance Media, known for IP blockbusters like Top Gun: Maverick and Mission Impossible—The Final Reckoning. However, just when the deal seemed as good as ready, a Trump-size problem emerged. First, the then-candidate filed a $10 billion lawsuit the week before Election Day, nonsensically accusing Paramount-owned 60 Minutes of favorably editing opponent Kamala Harris’ “word salad” and thus conducting “a brazen attempt to interfere in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election.” (Observers of the Jan. 6 insurrection might have had some thoughts about that.) The allegation stemmed from an instance of seemingly differing answers offered to host Bill Whitaker in a preview clip aired on Face the Nation versus the final broadcast. CBS clarified that those Harris quotes had both been part of the answer to the same question, and that certain edits had been made for the sake of timing, per usual practice. The broadcaster soon published the full transcripts to back this fact up.\n\nNevertheless, even after Trump won reelection, he kept up his case against Paramount, with the help of his loyalists. Soon after the election results, Brendan Carr—then a Federal Communications Commission commissioner who was in line to head the agency under Trump—straight-up told Fox News that the Harris edit would be taken into consideration when regulators decided whether or not to approve the Skydance merger. Shortly after the inauguration, Trump announced a private sector A.I. initiative that involved Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison—who just so happens to be a long-favored friend of Trump’s, as well as the father of David Ellison, founder and CEO of Skydance Media. Last month, the younger Ellison joined the president ringside at a UFC event, where they were spotted conversing and shaking hands. Trump would later praise David in public while once again bringing up the 60 Minutes interview. (His thoughts on David as potential chief of Paramount and CBS: “He’ll do a great job with it.”) Also worth a mention: Larry himself will have voting control over the Skydance-Paramount behemoth, as a corporate investor in the $8 billion merger.\n\nSo, even though various First Amendment lawyers had deemed Trump’s case to be baseless and absurd (one told CNN that the case was “ridiculous junk”), the White House kept unsubtly hinting that Paramount’s future depended upon whether the company would make Carr, Trump, and the Ellisons happy. Paramount’s owners and executives appeared to get that message, and insider reporting throughout Trump’s term kept indicating that Shari Redstone, Mr. Cheeks, and their fellow stakeholders appeared willing to kowtow to the administration—instead of defending their employees and journalists. In fact, their only purported hesitation seemed to be the appearance of effectively bribing Trump by settling with him.\n\nIn May, multiple Democratic senators sent letters to Redstone urging her to retract any settlement offer and to “stand up for freedom of the press and our democracy.” Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, who signed on to those letters, went further by threatening to summon Paramount executives “to explain their crimes in front of Congress and to the public when Democrats retake power.” (After the settlement was made official, Wyden outright called it a “bribe” and reiterated that “when Democrats retake power, I’ll be first in line calling for federal charges. In the meantime, state prosecutors should make the corporate execs who sold out our democracy answer in court, today.”) Lawmakers from the California state government likewise invited former CBS executives to testify in front of the state Senate.\n\nNevertheless, we’ve reached this settlement. Lisa Graves, president of the Center for Media and Democracy, told me in a statement that it’s part of a dispiriting pattern under Trump’s second term.\n\n“The settlement seems designed in part to curry favor with Trump, who has wielded the power of the White House to subject companies and industries to what seem like shakedowns to get his way,” she said. “It comes in the wake of several major law firms caving to Trump. It also comes as Verizon obeyed with Trump’s authoritarian squeeze on industries by preemptively dropping its commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion in its workplace.” (It should be noted: Paramount has admitted that the $16 million payout will serve to cover Trump’s legal fees, with the rest of the money acting as an in-kind donation to his future presidential library.)\n\nAnd how have CBS and the 60 Minutes felt about all this, you ask? Well, pretty awful. In April, 60 Minutes executive Bill Owens—who’d worked with CBS since the late 1980s—resigned in protest of the proposed settlement; about a month later, CBS News president Wendy McMahon was forced out for her consistent objection to the settlement. Live on the air to its millions of regular viewers, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley took a few minutes of his April 27 episode to chide CBS’ parent company, stating that “Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways” and calling it out for “trying to complete a merger” with approval from the Trump administration.\n\nIndeed, all of the show’s brand-name hosts sent a letter to the Paramount C-suite imploring Cheeks and his fellow execs to keep resisting Trump’s suit. Even non-CBS talent at Paramount registered their disapproval, as the creators of South Park (which remains one of the corporation’s most successful properties) alleged that Paramount and Skydance had messed with their contract even before the merger had been approved. While all accused have denied that characterization, the South Park guys are still shaking their fists, having declared the merger a “shitshow” just this week.\n\nThe angst inside Paramount and CBS has not calmed down, and likely will not anytime soon. Many 60 Minutes staffers are still frustrated that the company did not pursue what seemed like a very winnable case against Trump. The Writers Guild of America, East, which represents CBS News’ editorial union, said the parent company’s cop-out “threatens journalists’ ability to do their job reporting on powerful public figures.” On Wednesday, CBS Evening News co-anchor (and Slate Political Gabfest co-host) John Dickerson asked his viewers on air, “The Paramount settlement poses a new obstacle: Can you hold power to account after paying it millions? Can an audience trust you when it thinks you’ve traded away that trust?”\n\nMeanwhile, Trumpist media outlets have reacted just as you’d expect, with Ben Shapiro’s Daily Wire declaring, falsely, that the president’s lawsuit had “exposed” a “deceptively edited Kamala interview,” and the American Spectator pointing out, correctly, that this result is “humiliating” for CBS. (One reliably conservative outfit that did not take glee in this outcome: the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board, which labeled this outcome a “worrying precedent” for American media.) Plenty of aggrieved liberals and press advocates also took to social media to announce the immediate cancellation of their Paramount+ subscriptions.\n\nPaul Goodman, a legal counsel at the Center for Accessible Technology who’s been agitating against Verizon’s DEI capitulation to the FCC, was one of those Paramount+ quitters. “For Paramount, it seems like they’re commodifying First Amendment rights—the First Amendment has a price on it, and that price is getting a merger,” he told me in an interview. “It makes me think of that quote attributed to Ben Franklin: ‘Those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.’ ”\n\nIf Paramount investors seem inclined to rush to that safety, it’s not least because the iconic entertainment brand has been run rather poorly. Rounds upon rounds of layoffs, cuts to programming, investment in a streaming service that everyone hates, Zaslav-level bungling of iconic brands, a rock-bottom crash in stock value post-pandemic, sweeping back-catalog scrubbing that’s pissed off the many celebrities who’ve done shows and movies under Paramount—this chaos is what has defined the executives, instead of any measurable business successes. For that reason, as Goodman noted to me and as my colleague Alex Kirshner has explained, it makes sense from a pure biz standpoint to do anything that could improve Paramount’s corporate health, including an expedited merger.\n\nBut there’s more trouble ahead for Paramount, even with its Skydance savior. Sen. Elizabeth Warren joined her colleague Wyden’s call for “a full investigation into whether or not any anti-bribery laws were broken.” The Freedom of the Press Foundation—which owns some shares of Paramount—has threatened to sue Redstone and the company over the settlement. The very liberals who form the audience for Paramount’s most popular shows, like 60 Minutes and The Daily Show, are likely to boycott the whole enterprise as fervently as they have, say, the now-struggling Washington Post. And this entire “shitshow” is likely to define the legacies of Shari Redstone, George Cheeks, Father and Son Ellison, and all their business partners as our bedrocks of democracy crumble under Donald Trump. At least they got some cash out of it.","summary":"With a $16 million settlement with Trump, the media company just struck a deal that showed how easily the First Amendment can be bartered away.","url":"https://slate.com/technology/2025/07/paramount-skydance-merger-trump-settlement.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/d4245487-af6c-4c62-9904-b4aef5e5d7c5.jpeg?crop=3000%2C2000%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-03 20:44:49","author":"Nitish Pahwa","authors":["Nitish Pahwa"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.507},{"id":338001630,"title":"The 2 House Republicans who voted no on Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill","text":"President Donald Trump's major tax cut and spending bill passed the House on Thursday, but not without some Republican opposition.\n\nRep.

Some of the hardliners who ultimately voted yes say President Trump made promises to get their votes, including that he'd make the bill \"better\" in the future.\n\nOn Thursday, Massie said he did not vote for the bill because of its projected impact on the national debt. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill could add $3.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.\n\n\"Although there were some conservative wins in the budget reconciliation bill (OBBBA), I voted No on final passage because it will significantly increase U.S. budget deficits in the near term, negatively impacting all Americans through sustained inflation and high interest rates,\" Massie wrote on X.

Trump suggested Massie should be challenged in the upcoming Republican primary, even before this latest vote.\n\n\"The good news is that we will have a wonderful American Patriot running against him in the Republican Primary, and I’ll be out in Kentucky campaigning really hard,\" Trump wrote.\n\nRep. Fitzpatrick did vote for the House bill in May, but said on Thursday that the Senate changes to the bill (which resulted in deeper cuts to Medicaid) as the reason for his change in position.\n\nAs I’ve stated throughout these negotiations, with each iteration of legislative text that was placed on the House Floor, I’ve maintained a close and watchful eye on the specific details of these provisions, and determined the specific district impact, positive or negative, on our PA-1 community,\" Fitzpatrick said in a statement.\n\n\"I voted to strengthen Medicaid protections, to permanently extend middle class tax cuts, for enhanced small business tax relief, and for historic investments in our border security and our military,\" he added/ \"However, it was the Senate’s amendments to Medicaid, in addition to several other Senate provisions, that altered the analysis for our PA-1 community. The original House language was written in a way that protected our community; the Senate amendments fell short of our standard.\"\n\n\"I believe in, and will always fight for, policies that are thoughtful, compassionate, and good for our community. It is this standard that will always guide my legislative decisions,\" Fitzpatrick said.\n\nThe Pennsylvania congressman, who also faces reelection in 2026, represents a swing district that went blue in 2024 for Kamala Harris.","summary":"President Donald Trump's major tax cut and spending bill passed the House on Thursday, but not without some Republican opposition.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/2-house-republicans-voted-trumps-sweeping-domestic-policy/story?id=123459797","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/1010286d-94e3-4438-986b-a08f285b0616/fitzpaterick-massie-gty-gmh-250703_1751569548147_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-03 20:04:13","author":"Alexandra Hutzler","authors":["Alexandra Hutzler"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.048}]}
