In a new column for the outlet, Gustavo Arellano lamented that Trump will be heading the task force in charge of the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and warned the president would use the spectacle and the city for his own agenda. \"That’s why L.A. needs to withdraw from hosting the Olympics — the sooner the better,\" Arellano wrote. Arellano said when Los Angeles 2028, the group tasked with organizing the Olympics in the city, chair Casey Wasserman announced Trump as head of the task force, it was like him offering the city a \"giant whoopi cushion.\" TRACKING THE TRANS ATHLETE HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS CONTROVERSIES SHAKING THE NATION OVER THE LAST YEAR The columnist went on to trash other top officials from the Trump administration who were present at the announcement. \"On Trump’s right was a rash of L.A. haters, some of whom played a prominent role in Southern California’s summer of deportations, including Vice President JD Vance and Department of Homeland Security head Kristi Noem,\" he wrote. \"Not present, but hailed by Trump during the presser as an ‘MVP candidate,’ was Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who has made it his life’s mission to crush the multicultural metropolis that birthed him.\" Wasserman’s praise for Trump was, according to Arellano, nothing short of groveling. \"I haven’t seen such a suck-up since the last time I vacuumed my dad’s pool,\" he wrote. \"And you definitely don’t entrust kiss a-- like Wasserman — I’m still not sure what he did to deserve his powerful LA28 gig, except being the grandson of the late Hollywood mogul Lew Wasserman — with calming down someone like Trump.\" ‘60 MINUTES’ KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S CBS LAWSUIT RECEIVES EMMY NOMINATION Arellano noted how the federal government was always going to be involved with hosting the Olympic Games but said that the fact that Trump is part of it makes it problematic. \"The federal government was always going to play a role in providing security for the 2028 Olympics, just as it has for previous Games in the U.S. But Trump, as the head of the task force, now gets to personally oversee our own siege,\" he wrote. \"With the Games happening in a presidential election year, Trump would love nothing more than to traipse around an L.A. radically transformed by his deportation blitzkrieg to proclaim his mission accomplished and broadcast his conquest to the world.\" He also warned that Trump would use the next three years of Olympics prep to \"humiliate blue L.A. at every chance.\" Arellano asked readers if they wanted to give Trump and his \"goon squad\" more opportunities to make life \"miserable\" in Los Angeles. He said he'd rather forego the city hosting the games because \"I don’t want my money going toward something that Trump will use to bolster his noxious legacy. I’m not going to cheer on Wasserman as he chums up Trump while la migra continues to terrorize L.A., possibly for months, if not years.\" \"La Migra\" is a Spanish language term, often used in slang, that refers to U.S. immigration enforcement agencies, primarily U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the U.S. Border Patrol.

He was stunned.\n\nAnd that explains why he's done: Howard Stern, like so many overpaid, irrelevant fixtures of legacy media, has been out of touch with the average American for decades.\n\nThe Stern who once electrified fans and haters for being utterly unafraid to offend — attacking hypocritical celebrities, companies, televangelists, politicians of all stripes and his own bosses with glee — lost his mojo long ago.\n\nCovid and Trump finished him off.\n\nIn December 2020 — the same month his pal Alec Baldwin's wife was revealed to be a fake Spanish person (not that the new, Hollywood Howie ever made so much as a crack about that) — Stern renewed his contract with SiriusXM for a reported $120 million per year over five years.\n\nLooks like time's up! Just as it is for Stephen Colbert — who managed to kill off the entire Late Show franchise.\n\nGo woke, go broke.\n\nOh, and don't alienate over half the audience while you're at it.\n\n'I don't think [Trump] should be anywhere near the White House,' Stern said, on-air, in September 2024 — two months before the election, and one month before conducting a fawning, in-person interview with Kamala Harris.\n\n'I hate the people who vote for him,' Stern continued. 'I think they're stupid. I do.'\n\nAnd with that statement, he severed whatever trust or affection his dwindling audience retained.\n\nStern, who grew up middle-class on Long Island, a perennial outsider and champion of the average American — that guy was gone.\n\nHe also remained willfully ignorant of the digital lane and competitors such as Joe Rogan, himself a welcoming figure for the millions alienated — rejected, really — by Howard Stern.\n\n'I don't know what you could do to get noticed on this YouTube,' Stern said in 2021 — YouTube, which was well on pace to compete with TV and whose content creators, Rogan and Theo Von among them, were shrewdly used by the Trump campaign to reach undecided voters.\n\n'Podcasts,' Stern added. 'They're bores. They're f***ing bores.'\n\nHis refusal to move with the times is reflected in the lack of effort he puts into his namesake show.\n\nHoward has barely been back at his midtown NYC studio since lockdown ended. He prefers to broadcast from his metaphorical basement, whether in his $25 million oceanfront mansion in the Hamptons — where he reportedly heard the news of his imminent ousting — or his $65 million compound in Palm Beach.\n\nAgain, this is how out-of-touch he is: For putting on a lackluster, unfunny show 3 days a week, with lengthy breaks throughout the year, including the entire summer — pocketing more than $1 million per show — he was shocked, shocked, to find his services no longer needed. Or wanted.\n\nHere was the once brash, brazen and fearless shock jock in April 2021, after lockdown had ended and vaccines were in circulation: 'Things will never get back to normal. I do not believe the pandemic will ever be over.'\n\nThis Stern was unrecognizable from the host who stayed on the air as planes flew into the World Trade Center on September 11.\n\nHis worldview and interests have only narrowed, become more narcissistic, germophobic and paranoid, while the digital lane explodes with talent that's cheaper, fresher and simply more entertaining.\n\nStern's fall, while expected, is also huge.\n\nNever again will terrestrial or satellite radio see the likes of him, a monocultural figure who dominated and defined his industry.\n\nNow he goes the way of Stephen Colbert, 61.\n\nMy best guess is that Anderson Cooper, 58, CNN's reportedly $18 million-a-year man, will be next out the door.\n\nPuck reported in June that Cooper's boss, David Zaslav, is looking to cut costs at the flailing network.\n\nCooper's show, which airs at 8pm weekdays, has reportedly been shedding eyeballs in the key 25 to 54-year-old demographic.\n\nMeanwhile, younger host Kaitlan Collins, who makes a reported one-fifth of Cooper's salary, had the gall to post from her brand-new summer home on Nantucket — as CNN colleagues get the ax, face pay cuts, or take on more work for less money.\n\nMark my words: Gayle King, 70, CBS's overpaid morning show host-slash-Oprah appendage, will be out as early as next spring.\n\nKing recently signed an extension, reportedly worth up to $15 million, that takes her through next May. But she's turned CBS Mornings preachy and humorless, losing between 20 to 30 percent in that 25 to 54 demo.\n\n'The audience doesn't want woke,' a CBS source told The New York Post.\n\nNor do they want a haughty presence who gloats about going to outer space, or having accompanied Oprah to the Bezos-Sanchez wedding, or whose overall vibe is sanctimonious and insufferable.\n\nSo Stern's not the only one, but he is singular in his tenure, the money and ratings he once generated, and his impact on the culture.\n\nThe younger Howard would never have predicted he wouldn't know when to leave.\n\nIf only he had listened more closely — the very thing he was once paid so handsomely to do.","summary":"This looks like Howard's End.

In the months after the 2024 election, the Democratic Party has had a fraught relationship with former President Biden and Harris remaining in the public eye, with some prominent party figures wishing they would fade into the background. Harris recently announced she would not run for California governor, a move which many speculate leaves the door open for her to run for president again in 2028.

The Treasury Department is tasked with creating a strategy and new regulations to prevent \"unlawful\" debanking, while the Attorney General would oversee and investigate cases of people suspected of being debanked in discriminatory ways.The Trump Organization and Eric Trump sued Capital One earlier this year for closing accounts in the wake of the January 6, 2021, riot. Capital One has denied wrongdoing, and litigation is ongoing.Earlier this week, Trump told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in an interview that Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase had previously refused to accept his deposits.\"They totally discriminate against, I think, me maybe even more, but they discriminate against many conservatives,\" he told show host Andrew Ross Sorkin. \"I think the word might be 'Trump supporters' more than conservatives.\"In a statement to Reuters, JPMorgan said it doesn't close accounts for political reasons, while Bank of America did not address Trump's claims.In January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump claimed Bank of America and other banks were refusing to accept conservative customers, which the Charlotte-based lender denied.Prior to the inauguration, crypto-connected supporters of the president turned debanking into a political issue. Well-known venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said on Joe Rogan's podcast that dozens of tech founders had been cut off from banking services during former President Joe Biden's administration.Banks are just the latest industry to draw the president's ire, despite the fact that the securities and investment industry gave more to Trump than his opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, according to political donation tracker OpenSecrets. Trump's cabinet also includes Howard Lutnick, a banker who ran Cantor Fitzgerald before becoming the Secretary of Commerce.The executive order could result in fines for banks found to have discriminated against conservatives, mimicking the White House's tactics for punishing other industries.Trump started his year by pulling funding from elite higher education institutions that he accused of condoning discrimination on campus. He soon pivoted to an ongoing legal battle with the country's biggest law firms, some of whom have represented clients in court cases against him.Then, as his tariff policies intensified, Trump went after the likes of Amazon and Walmart for potentially being explicit about how these trade barriers would drive up prices for US consumers. More recently, Big Pharma executives woke up one morning to a letter from the president, threatening them to lower the prices of drugs.Capitol One and the Bank of America did not immediately respond to requests for comments.","summary":"Trump's 'debanking' executive order targets financial institutions he believes are denying services to conservatives, including his family business.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-debanking-executive-order-2025-8","image":"https://i.insider.com/68927f703d5881a51c1eab7f?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-07 23:51:57","author":"Bradley Saacks,Katherine Li","authors":["Bradley Saacks","Katherine Li"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.554},{"id":349134780,"title":"Is there a Trump side deal or not? New Paramount chief doesn’t want to talk about it","text":"David Ellison made one thing abundantly clear on his first official day as the owner of the new Paramount – he did not want to get into whether a side deal was reached as part of the pre-merger $16 million lawsuit settlement paid to Donald Trump.\n\nAfter a grueling and politically tainted 13-month process, Skydance Media’s $8.4 billion merger with Paramount Global officially closed Thursday. Weeks before Trump’s Federal Communications Commission finally approved the deal, however, Paramount – then led by Shari Redstone – agreed to settle with the president in his “meritless” complaint about a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris.\n\nSettling with Trump, which has long been a fraught topic in CBS hallways and sparked the resignations of several news leaders, prompted accusations of “bribery” from lawmakers and free press advocates. Those allegations only grew louder after the president boasted just before the merger was approved that he had reached a separate agreement with Ellison to air up to $20 million of pro-Trump advertisements on CBS programming once Skydance took over.\n\nWhile the previous leadership of Paramount denied any knowledge of a secret handshake deal, Ellison – whose dad is pro-Trump Oracle founder Larry Ellison – had remained mum on the matter. However, with Thursday marking his first day as head of the newly minted Paramount Skydance, Ellison found himself pressed repeatedly on the issue at a press event heralding the merger.\n\nHaving spent his morning making a symbolic first stop at the CBS News offices, where he “said all the right things” while assuring the staff of his commitment to the news division, Ellison and his senior leadership team held a Q&A session at the company’s headquarters in Times Square. While he was there to put forward his vision for the new Paramount’s future, a number of media reporters were more interested in the recent past.\n\n“We were not involved in the settlement in any way,” Ellison said when asked about the Trump payoff, adding that “we complied with all laws including anti-bribery laws.” \n\nHe then cited a recent letter sent to Democratic senators who inquired about the side deal and Paramount’s cancellation of the longtime CBS late-night show hosted by Trump critic Stephen Colbert, which occurred just days before the administration approved the merger. \n\nThat letter, which was from Skydance’s general counsel, said the company was “not involved” in the Colbert decision but didn’t directly address the “side deal” question. “Skydance was neither a party to the lawsuit nor to Paramount’s settlement of its litigation with the President,” the Skydance lawyer wrote. \n\n“We’re focused on the future… We are not going to politicize anything today,” Ellison responded when asked another time about the president’s claims about free advertising. “We want to entertain first.”\n\nEllison would continue to double down on that message, specifically when asked about FCC chair Brendan Carr saying that Skydance had promised to “root out the bias that has undermined the trust in national news media” once it took over Paramount.\n\n“I do not want to politicize our company in any way shape or form, we want to obviously speak to the biggest audience possible,” he declared when pressed about any examples of bias he would intend to fix.\n\nShortly before the merger’s approval, Skydance told the FCC that it would hire an ombudsman to address “complaints of bias” at CBS News once it took over Paramount. Asked whether he was concerned that the FCC could take action based on the ombudsman’s findings, Ellison shrugged it off.\n\n“I don’t think it’ll get to that,” he said. “We want to be a path-based and truth-based news organization. That’s what we’re about. That’s the legacy of CBS.”\n\nWith Ellison also declining to answer questions about reports that he’s in talks with Bari Weiss to possibly purchase her anti-woke outlet, The Free Press ,and install her in a senior role at CBS News, saying he doesn’t want to address rumors, he continued down the same path time and time again.\n\n“We're ready to move past the noise,” he proclaimed.","summary":"‘We’re focused on the future… We are not going to politicize anything today,’ David Ellison said during a press event.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/paramount-trump-side-deal-cbs-settlement-b2804021.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/14/16/2210242606.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/EunU8KGS-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-07 21:51:44","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":349135748,"title":"Paramount and Skydance close their $8 billion merger, kicking off reign of new entertainment giant","text":"Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger on Thursday — kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious, over year-long endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line.\n\nThe new company — which will trade under the “PSKY” ticker on Wall Street — brings Paramount's legacy Hollywood footprint, major TV networks like CBS and MTV, streaming services and more under the roof of a new power player: billionaire Skydance founder David Ellison.\n\n“Today marks an exciting and pivotal moment as we prepare to bring Paramount’s legacy as a Hollywood institution into the future of entertainment,\" Ellison, who is now Chairman and CEO of Paramount, a Skydance Corporation, said in a statement. He added that he aims to “honor exceptional storytelling while modernizing how we make and deliver content.\"\n\nThe merger's close came just two weeks after it received regulatory approval from the Trump administration. While now a done deal, the path towards that approval was far from smooth sailing. Months of scrutiny and turmoil surrounded the transaction — particularly amid President Donald Trump’s legal battle with “60 Minutes,” the crown jewel of Paramount-owned broadcast network CBS. With the specter of the Trump administration potentially blocking the hard-fought deal with Skydance, Paramount agreed to pay a $16 million settlement to the president in early July.\n\nCritics of the settlement lambasted it as a veiled bribe to appease Trump, amid rising alarm over editorial independence overall. Further outrage also emerged after CBS said it was canceling Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show” just days after the comedian sharply criticized the parent company’s settlement on air. Paramount cited financial reasons, but big names both within and outside the company have questioned those motives.\n\nWhen still seeking approval to buy Paramount from the Federal Communication Commission, Skydance management assured regulators that it would carefully watch for any perceived bias at CBS News and hire an ombudsman to review any complaints about fairness. In filings just last month, the company’s general counsel maintained that New Paramount will embody “a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum” — and also noted that it plans to take a “comprehensive review” of CBS to make “any necessary changes.”\n\nBy the time the deal was approved, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr hailed the merger as an opportunity to bring more balance to “once-storied” CBS. “Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly. It is time for a change,\" Carr said.\n\nCarr also pointed to other commitments from Skydance — including company assurances about ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at Paramount. In a letter addressed to Carr days before the FCC's greenlight, Skydance wrote to “confirm the elimination” of DEI initiatives previously in place at Paramount — and maintained that Skydance “does not have DEI programs in place today and will not establish such initiatives.” \n\nSkydance pointed to the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision on affirmative action in college admissions, but such moves also arrive amid the Trump administration’s wider crackdown on DEI in the workplace — and the company cited recent federal mandates impacting employers, too, noting that Paramount announced “significant changes” to its recruiting and hiring practices in February 2025.\n\nThe FCC approved the merger by a 2-1 vote on July 24. The regulator who opposed it, FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, expressed disdain for how it all came together — pointing to “months of cowardly capitulation to this administration.”\n\n“In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom,” Gomez, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, said in a statement. She also said the agency overstepped its authority by “undermining legitimate efforts to combat discrimination and expand opportunity.”\n\nParamount's new leaders will be watched particularly closely for how they deal with CBS News, given the $16 million settlement with Trump following his complaint about last fall's “60 Minutes” interview with his Democratic opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris. And the merger could also have ripple effects across other Paramount properties, including its late night and comedy programming.\n\nWhen first announcing the deal in July 2024, Ellison also stressed the need to transition into a “tech hybrid” to stay competitive in today’s entertainment landscape. That included plans to “rebuild” the Paramount+ streaming service, among wider efforts to expand direct-to-consumer offerings in a world with more entertainment options and shorter attention spans.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Mike Rogers, who is touting the endorsement of President Donald Trump.\n\nHere’s who to watch in that critical 2026 Senate race, which could help decide the direction of the Democratic Party.\n\nHaley Stevens\n\nStevens, 42, has represented Michigan’s wealthy 11th Congressional District since 2019.\n\nCNN has cited anonymous sources claiming that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and the chairwoman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Kirsten Gillibrand, both D-N.Y., have “privately signaled” they think Stevens has the best chance of winning.\n\nOne way Stevens is setting herself apart from some within the progressive and Muslim wings of the Michigan Democratic Party is through her support of Israel.\n\n She has been praised by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee for her support of the Jewish state, which she has called a “strong ally of the United States of America, a democracy, and a beacon of hope.”\n\nThe self-described “Zionist” has also railed against the lax response to antisemitism on college campuses nationwide.\n\nMallory McMorrow\n\nMcMorrow, a 38-year-old, redheaded Democrat who hails originally from New Jersey, first gained national prominence at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, where she slammed a supersized copy of The Heritage Foundation’s “Mandate for Leadership” onto a lectern as she criticized the Trump campaign.\n\nMcMorrow serves as the state Senate majority whip in Lansing and represents roughly the same wealthy Detroit suburban area as Stevens.\n\nRogers has been homing in on McMorrow’s image as a coastal elite, referring to her as “New Jersey transplant Mallory McMarxist” and “a glorified influencer.”\n\nMcMorrow has set herself apart from Stevens with a more critical stance on Israel, saying of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, “We cannot let this man tell us that what we are seeing with our own eyes is not what is actually happening.”\n\nAbdul El-Sayed\n\nEl-Sayed formerly served as the director of the Department of Health, Human, and Veterans Services for Wayne County, Michigan, and ran for governor in 2018 with the backing of democratic socialists, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, at the time a New York Democrat running for Congress.\n\nWhat’s El-Sayed’s sales pitch to Michigan Democrat primary voters? That he’s the antiestablishment candidate who can steer the party in a new direction.\n\n“If D.C. comes in and spends a lot of money to dictate what happens in this primary, I think Democrats are going to lose,” El-Sayed has said. “I’m not surprised that they would go with somebody like Haley Stevens. I think that’s discounting just how complicated our state is.”\n\nEl-Sayed, a former University of Michigan lacrosse player, entered the Senate race with Sanders’ backing. Hailing from a heavily Arab section of Michigan, he has not shied away from criticizing Israel.\n\n“Our tax dollars are being sent in a blank-check format to a foreign military to impose a genocide and mass starvation on the people of Gaza,” he said in a recent video.\n\nMichigan’s sizable Muslim and Middle Eastern communities played a major role in President Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential victory. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., notably refused to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris, a fellow Democrat, reflecting major discontent over the Democratic Party’s treatment of the Israel issue.\n\nEl-Sayed has made clear he’s willing to rock the boat within the party, as well.\n\n“Joe Biden’s handling of Gaza was indicative of a general failure to be able to do the job,” he said in an interview.\n\nOn economics, El-Sayed criticized monopolies, which he accuses of contributing to price increases. “We need representation that’s willing to stand up to monopoly power in our economy so that we can get paid more and pay less,” he said in a video posted on the social media platform X.","summary":"Zohran Mamdani&#8217;s ascent in New York City’s mayoral race is being heralded as the reconfiguration of the Democratic Party, but the Democrat Senate primary in...

Still, they are an important gauge of voter sentiment about both Democrats and Republicans as candidates begin ramping up their campaigns.Historically, the party in the White House loses seats in the midterms, and recent polls show President Donald Trump's approval has fallen since the start of his administration, fueling Democratic optimism about a 2018-esque blue wave. But several GOP-led states may redraw their congressional boundaries to become more favorable to Republicans in an attempt to thwart Democratic gains.While blue states like California say they will redraw their own maps to retaliate, the full impact of these mid-decade redraws in states like Texas or Missouri could limit Democratic gains in November 2026.What To KnowA flurry of recent polls have delivered good news for Democrats, showing them ahead of Republicans on the generic ballot, which asks voters which party they'll be supporting, rather than specific candidates.A CNBC poll released Thursday, for instance, showed Democrats with a 5-point lead on the generic ballot. Forty-nine percent of respondents said they would vote for Democratic candidates, while 44 percent said they'd back Republicans. That's up from a lead of 48 percent to 44 percent in April.The poll surveyed 1,000 adults nationwide from July 29 to August 3. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.The latest poll from YouGov and The Economist showed Democrats up 6 percentage points—44 percent to 38 percent. It surveyed 1,528 registered voters from August 1 to August 4.An Emerson College poll showed Democrats with a more modest 2-point lead—44 percent to 42 percent. It surveyed 1,400 registered voters on July 21 and July 22, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.For context, in 2024, Republicans won the House popular vote by about 2.6 points and won a 220-215 majority. In 2022, Republicans won the popular vote by 2.7 points and secured a 222-213 majority.In 2020, Democrats won the popular vote by 3.1 points and also had a 222-213 majority.In 2018, the midterm of Trump's first term in office, Democrats won a 235-199 majority, picking up 41 seats.These polls show a lead for Democrats, but are not predictive of a blue wave like in 2018, Raymond La Raja, professor of political science and co-director of University of Massachusetts Amherst's polling program, told Newsweek.This is because Trump is more of a \"quantified figure\" to voters this time around, and Democrats are more demoralized after the 2024 losses, he said.\"I think Democrats are very disappointed about the loss in 2024. They think the party made mistakes that demoralized them. The base doesn't think they're fighting hard enough against the Trump administration,\" La Raja said. \"In many ways, there's not much they can do. They lack power in both chambers. They're frustrated about that.\"Democrats likely need polling giving them a 7- or 8-point lead over Republicans in generic ballot polling to indicate a blue wave, he said. The economy will be a key factor in the midterms. If it falters, Democrats are more likely to pick up more seats. But if it hold steady, gains may be more limited, La Raja added.Grant Davis Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University, told Newsweek that Trump being underwater on major policy issues like immigration and tariffs does not \"bode well\" for the GOP, but a \"huge wave\" may be less likely for Democrats.\"I would expect Republicans to lose the House, and have thought so since election day. Only George W. Bush was able to increase his party's majority in the House, and that was not a typical mid-term, given 9-11,\" he said. \"The Republican margin is razor-thin, so any kind of set-back would likely knock them out of the majority. But I wouldn't expect to see a huge wave, in part because we are even more polarized than before, and that tends to make movement from one party to the other more difficult.\"How Americans are experiencing the economy in the months leading up to the midterms will be decisive for Democrats' returns, he said.Midterms 2026: What Do Betting Odds Show?Betting odds also give Democrats an advantage in the midterms for the House of Representatives. Polymarket shows them with a 71 percent chance of flipping the chamber. However, Republicans are favored in the Senate, where Democrats face a challenging map to win back control from the GOP's 53-47 majority.GOP-held seats in Maine, won by former Vice President Kamala Harris, and North Carolina, which Trump carried by only 3 points in 2024, present their best opportunities to flip a seat next year. But no other swing states are up for grabs, meaning they'll need to flip seats Trump won by the lower double-digits, like Alaska, Iowa, Ohio or Texas, to win back control.Will Redistricting Threaten Democratic Majority in 2027?The impact of redistricting remains an open question.Texas, with Trump's support, kicked of the redistricting \"arms race,\" with Republicans proposing a map that could give them up to five new seats. States like Missouri, Indiana and Florida could also give Republicans more seats if they redraw.On the other hand, Democratic states like California, Maryland and New York are eyeing their own redistricting in response to Texas. But Democrats in some of those states are likely to face legal challenges to redistrict due to independent commissions or other laws making it more difficult to undertake mid-decade redraws.If this is a low-pickup year for Democrats, it is \"plausible\" this redistricting could outright cost them a majority,\" according to La Raja.Reeher said it's hard to know how either party will win on this front ahead of the midterms.\"There will be tons of lawsuits, and a lot of these redrawn districts will be in limbo, perhaps right up until the election,\" he said. \"Hard to say who 'wins' on this, on a short-term basis. Long-term, we all lose if this becomes the new normal.\"What People Are SayingReeher also told Newsweek: \"As to why the party of the president typically loses seats in a mid-term, it's because we have a two-party system, and the out-party has two years to criticize what the in-party is doing, or trying to do, and the struggles of the president are front and center in the media for everyone to see. And people simply tire of each president, to some degree. There's a natural tendency toward buyer's remorse and a desire to check what is being done. Political human nature is at the root of it all.\"Presidents also tend to ask their party's more marginal members to make some tough votes to get their agendas through in the first couple years, when their political capital is highest, and there's often a reaction against those votes by the voters in those marginal districts. That's what happened in the Tea Party's response to Obamacare, for example, and something similar may happen with the OBBB [One Big Beautiful Bill Act] in this election cycle. Some Republicans made some hard votes in favor on that bill.\"Shelton also told Newsweek: \"The midterms are shaping up to be a referendum on who is going to lower costs and improve the lives of everyday Americans, not the wealthiest few. By all accounts, the Republican trifecta is failing miserably and we're seeing an escalating level of buyer's remorse amongst the public. People hate the Big, Ugly Law, oppose price-spiking tariffs, and are showing their displeasure at rallies and town halls across the country. House Democrats will re-take the majority powered by an aggressive message focused on fighting for lowering prices and holding Republicans and Trump accountable for their record of broken promises.\"CNN Harry Enten wrote in a July 25 X post: \"Trump's drop w/ indies is his biggest danger sign. There seems to be no bottom. He owns the worst net approval w/ indies 6 months into a presidency (-29 pt), beating his own record. Wave adios to the GOP House majority if his net approval on inflation w/ indies (-45 pt!) holds.\"What Happens NextThe midterms will be held November 3, 2026.New Jersey and Virginia elections held in three months will be earlier gauges of the Trump administration's popularity.","summary":"Democrats are leading generic ballot polls, but two experts told Newsweek that may not translate to a 2018-style blue wave.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-chances-flipping-congress-polls-2110470","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2698586/rep-jeffries-midterms-generic-ballot-polling.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=b5b0643803d20ef7b2486575a44c5409","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-07 20:52:07","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.019},{"id":349141730,"title":"New Paramount head doesn’t want to ‘politicize’ company as merger closes","text":"“We’re not going to politicize anything today.

Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, and Gov. Gavin Newsom during a congressional hearing.\n\nThe video claimed that Hawley cleaned Newsom’s clock in their debate over a lawsuit that Newsom had filed. The problem is it was fake, created with video snippets of both politicians and a voiceover describing what supposedly happened.\n\nThe video, which has since vanished from YouTube, is a fairly crude example of how technology can be manipulated to depict seemingly real events.\n\nMore sophisticated examples of artificial intelligence, known as deepfakes, can literally put words in political figures’ mouths or even create seemingly real persons.\n\nLast year, Christopher Kohls, going by the name “Mr. Reagan” on social media, posted a video in which Kamala Harris seemingly acknowledged that she had been the “ultimate diversity hire” when Joe Biden chose her as his vice presidential running mate.\n\nKohls said it was a parody, but Elon Musk posted it on his social media platform X, drawing criticism from Newsom and a vow to outlaw such material. It was one of many clashes with Musk, the billionaire electric car and rocket tycoon, after he became a Donald Trump ally.\n\nWithin weeks, Newsom signed two bills aimed at either regulating or banning AI-generated political videos. Kohl, later joined by other content creators, sued, contending that they violate free speech.\n\nThis week John Mendez, a federal judge in Sacramento, struck down one of the measures, Assembly Bill 2655, carried by Assemblyman Marc Berman, a Palo Alto Democrat. He ruled that the federal Communications Decency Act protects X and other sites from liability for material posted by third parties, such as Kohl or Musk.\n\nAB 2655 would have barred internet sites from posting deceptive political material during campaign seasons. “They don’t have anything to do with these videos that the state is objecting to,” Mendez said.\n\nNotably, Mendez indicated that he will also reject the second measure, Assembly Bill 2839, carried by Assemblywoman Gail Pellerin, a Santa Cruz Democrat. It would prohibit anyone from “knowingly distributing an advertisement or other election communication … that contains certain materially deceptive content.”\n\n“I think the statute just fails miserably in accomplishing what it would like to do,” Mendez said, adding “It’s become a censorship law and there is no way that is going to survive.”\n\nAs the country’s political polarization deepens, voters become more willing to believe allegations that those on the other side of the divide are evil, corrupt and power hungry. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence makes political deepfakes ever more sophisticated and capable of fooling gullible voters into believing their lies.\n\nExaggeration, selective facts and downright lies have always been evident in political campaigns, but historically held in check, at least partially, by newspapers and other political media.\n\nThe bills that Democratic legislators and a Democratic governor enacted last year were clearly aimed at crippling media on the other side of the ideological divide but, as Judge Mendez ruled, violate free speech.\n\nCensorship cannot be the answer. The approach that Newsom and legislators took is a slippery slope that would invite retaliation from their political rivals, thus deepening the already yawning political divide.\n\nIt is, however, a genuine quandary. Unfettered use of AI-driven deepfakes in political campaigns present an obvious peril, but so does any effort to prohibit free speech, no matter how distasteful.\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"Censorship cannot be the answer.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/08/07/deepfakes-pose-an-obvious-peril-in-politics-but-californias-bans-amount-to-censorship/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/California_Legislature-Sex_Trafficking_12021_9f84f7.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-07 20:10:45","author":"Dan Walters","authors":["Dan Walters"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":349134836,"title":"Trump’s FCC Considers Supercharging Corporate TV Consolidation","text":"Critics say Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Brendan Carr is ignoring legal precedent as the FCC moves to eliminate rules that effectively limit the number of local TV stations that corporate media conglomerates can own and operate. The FCC controls local TV and radio licenses, and while the telecom regulator is independent and overseen by Congress, advocates say Carr, who was appointed by Donald Trump, is turning the commission into a political weapon for the president.\n\nRecent moves by the FCC to reconsider broadcast ownership limits would unleash a new wave of media consolidation and threaten local TV newsrooms, critics say, which are already facing headwinds due to budget cuts, consolidation, and digital competition, despite their critical role in keeping voters and the general public informed. However, the media watchdog group Free Press says Carr is also working on behalf of the Trump administration to use the FCC’s leverage over broadcast licenses and media mergers “to exert total control over the media,” according to comments the group filed with the FCC on August 3.\n\n“With this proceeding Chairman Carr is placing a for-sale sign on the public airwaves and inviting media companies to monopolize the local news markets as long as they agree to display political fealty to Donald Trump and the MAGA movement,” said S. Derek Turner, the senior economic and policy adviser at Free Press, in a statement.\n\nIn 2004, Congress capped the proportion of U.S. households that television stations owned by a single company can collectively reach at 39 percent. This ownership cap limits the size and reach of broadcasting giants such as Fox Corporation, Nexstar, and Sinclair, which already own hundreds of local stations across the country. Broadcasters that take advantage of a certain FCC provision can reach up to 78 percent of the nation without running afoul of the ownership cap, according to the Internet & Television Association (NCTA).\n\nCongress exempted the 39 percent cap from the FCC’s quadrennial review of telecom regulations. In 2017, the FCC sought public comment on whether to keep, modify, or eliminate the cap under the first Trump administration, but ultimately never made a change. With Carr, a Republican and Trump appointee, now leading the commission, the FCC in June reopened the docket and invited fresh public comments on the ownership cap, taking the first step toward changing the rules administratively.\n\nIn comments filed with the FCC on August 4, Free Press called the latest proceedings on the audience cap a “farce.” The group alleges that Carr long ago made up his mind to dismantle what’s left of the FCC’s broadcast ownership rules, and is wielding the commission’s authority to help Trump intimidate media companies and shape coverage of his administration. If the audience cap is lifted, media conglomerates would be free to gobble up more local TV stations — as long as the FCC approves the broadcast licenses. \n\n“Media consolidation and deal approvals are now explicitly a way for President Trump to further consolidate his dictatorial power, through explicit loyalty tests and pledges to use the public airwaves as a propaganda tool against the American public,” Free Press wrote to the FCC.\n\nIndeed, the FCC recently approved the $8 billion merger of Paramount and the Hollywood media company Skydance after Paramount subsidiary CBSagreed to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over an interview with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, which Trump claimed was edited in a misleading way. Legal experts panned the lawsuit as meritless under the First Amendment, but instead of mounting a defense in the name of press freedom, CBSagreed to pay $16 million to Trump’s presidential library and install an ombudsman to address perceived political bias.\n\nFollowing the settlement, Paramount also canceled “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” which routinely mocks and criticizes Trump. Paramount has denied accusations by Colbert and others who say the company essentially paid a bribe to complete the merger.\n\nFree speech groups say the settlement sets a dangerous precedent that Trump and Carr are moving to replicate. Armed with a controversial interpretation of the FCC’s explicitly narrow authority under a decades-old broadcast “news distortion” policy, which covers local TV and radio stations licensed by the FCC but not cable networks, Carr has launched investigations into complaints of “bias” in news coverage at NBC, ABC, and CBS.\n\nLifting the 39 percent ownership cap and opening up local broadcast TV to further consolidation could create new opportunities for the administration to leverage license approvals and merger deals to squeeze concessions out of major news networks that anger Trump.\n\n“The price broadcast companies have to pay for consolidating further is bending the knee, and the line starts outside of the FCC chairman’s office,” Turner said.\n\nCorporate TV station owners have launched a lobbying campaign to remove the ownership cap. In comments to the FCC, the National Association of Broadcasters said removing the rule is an “emergency for TV broadcasting” that must compete with cable television and online streaming services that are not subject to such restrictions, such as YouTube and Netflix. The internet has transformed the video media market, the group wrote, making the ownership cap obsolete.\n\n“It is time — indeed, past time — for the Commission to expeditiously eliminate the national cap to ensure a more level playing field that allows broadcasters to not only survive, but also to thrive,” the group wrote.\n\nHowever, Free Press argues TV stations remain profitable, and the ownership cap is needed to mitigate market incentives that push media conglomerates to abandon local journalism. In additional comments to the FCC, the organization joined a coalition of 16 press freedom groups, which said there is no evidence that allowing “massive news- and broadcast-media cartels” would inspire investment in local news.\n\nThe groups pointed to an analysis of 35 major media companies that identified a pattern of editorial compromise and capitulation as owners of conglomerates seek to curry favor with political leadership, including the highly transactional Trump administration.\n\nThe longstanding ownership cap is still needed to support a diversity of voices on local TV broadcasts, the press freedom coalition argues, which remain an important and popular source of news and information — especially in dozens of communities across the U.S. where traditional newspapers have already collapsed. Research suggests that media consolidation can reduce viewpoint diversity when conglomerates replace local journalism with national programming — a major reason why Congress set the 39 percent ownership cap.\n\nCertain industry groups also support the ownership cap as well. The NCTA, which represents broadband and cable companies, filed comments arguing that only Congress has the authority to change the cap, and consumers would be harmed if TV station owners gain additional leverage and raise the cost of sharing programming. The American Television Alliance, a coalition of consumer groups and cable, satellite, and telecom companies, said these higher “retransmission fees” would push more cable subscribers toward streaming services and reduce incentives for conglomerates to invest in local journalism.\n\nA 2019 study found that consolidation of local media ownership is associated with a substantial increase of national news at the expense of local news, as well as a significant rightward shift in the ideological slant of the coverage. This is perhaps most visible at Sinclair, one of the largest owners of local TV stations and a notorious peddler of right-wing, pro-Trump propaganda.\n\n“Handing even more media control to a handful of capitulating conglomerates and billionaires already so dominant in the broadcast space is a wildly dangerous idea under any administration — but especially this one,” Turner said.","summary":"Media conglomerates are pushing to eliminate rules that limit consolidation of local TV stations.","url":"https://truthout.org/articles/trumps-fcc-considers-supercharging-corporate-tv-consolidation/","image":"https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2215642078-1536x1024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-07 19:48:54","author":"Mike Ludwig","authors":["Mike Ludwig"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.099},{"id":349112330,"title":"Harris taps Dem emails lists to market new book, sparking party neutrality concerns","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris’ upcoming book, \"107 Days,\" is getting some marketing assistance by tapping a Democratic Party-linked fundraising operations. Axios reported that the Harris Victory Fund, which was considered an effort by both the Democratic National Committee and the Harris' 2024 presidential campaign, was used to send out a marketing email for the book, but it did not ask for donations to the DNC. The email raised concerns about party neutrality in primaries, as Harris could be a potential candidate in the 2028 race. President Donald Trump will be term-limited in 2028, and both parties are expected to have contentious primaries next cycle. BIDEN TEAM IS READY TO DROP DIRT ON HARRIS IF SHE COMES AFTER HIM, MARK HALPERIN SAYS According to the outlet, the DNC did not send the email, and party email lists can be used for book promotions if they are paid for fairly. Fox News Digital independently confirmed with the DNC that they did not send the email. Harris spokeswoman Kirsten Allen told Axios that the use of the email list complied with Federal Election Commission rules. Nevertheless, the move indicates that Harris is leveraging the Democratic base to sell copies of the memoir that is expected to dive into her notably short campaign, which kicked off in summer 2024 after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race following early state primaries. \"It was intense, high-stakes, and deeply personal for me and for so many of you.

Harris recently announced that she would not run for governor of California in 2026, raising questions about whether she’ll seek the presidency once again in 2028.

The lawsuit, which was over the same \"60 Minutes\" interview that irked the FCC, accused CBS of aiding Harris through deceptive editing ahead of the presidential election. Industry insiders believe Ellison, who was spotted sitting with Trump at a UFC event in April, will aim to eliminate the perceived liberal slant at CBS News. He has committed to installing an ombudsman at CBS News and eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at Paramount, a Skydance Corporation. \"I write to confirm the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that were in place at Paramount and to confirm our commitments moving forward,\" Skydance general counsel Stephanie Kyoko McKinnon wrote last month in a letter to Carr.

That's my position. That's my stance.

That gap was notably pronounced among voters aged 18-29. While Harris won women in that group by 23 points, Trump won men by one point.What People Are SayingBiggs wrote in a June 21 post on X announcing her candidacy: \"My parents taught me to love my country, the Constitution, and to value my freedoms.

The Biden confidante who clashed with Hunter grilled in House autopen probe","text":"Anita Dunn is the 10th former Biden administration aide appearing before the House Oversight Committee as the panel investigates whether former President Joe Biden's inner circle covered up evidence of mental decline, and whether decisions were signed off on via autopen without his full awareness. Dunn is a longtime Democratic operative who has run communications for top left-wing figures and causes for decades. She first likely engaged with Biden when serving as communications director for Senate Democrats' campaign arm, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, in the late 1980s. Dunn was a central figure in shaping communications policy during Biden's White House term as well, and she played a key role in helping him prepare for re-election in 2024. RON KLAIN DODGES REPORTERS AFTER MARATHON GRILLING IN BIDEN COVER-UP PROBE Her husband, lawyer Robert Bauer, is also known as a figure close in Biden's orbit – having reportedly served as his personal lawyer. \"If it’s a room of five people, Anita and Bob are two of them,\" an unnamed former White House aide told NBC News in January 2023. But her relationship with others in Biden's circle has reportedly been rocky at times, particularly toward the end of his four-year term. NBC News reported in July 2024 that Biden family members discussed whether the president should fire Dunn and Bauer amid fallout from his disastrous debate against now-President Donald Trump, though White House chief of staff Jeff Zients dismissed the reports as \"unfounded and insulting rumors\" in a statement to the outlet at the time. Her relationship with Hunter Biden in particular, the former president's only living son, has been in the spotlight on multiple occasions. Dunn criticized the president's handling of his son Hunter's pardon during an event in Dec. 2024, saying that she disagreed with the \"timing\" and the \"rationale,\" describing it as an \"attack on our judicial system.\" \"Had this pardon been done at the end of the term in the context of compassion, the way many pardons will be done, I'm sure, and many commutations will be done, I think it would have been a different story,\" Dunn told a New York Times panel at the DealBook Summit 2024. \"So, I will say, I absolutely agree with the president's decision here. I do not agree with the way it was done, I don't agree with the timing, and I don't agree, frankly, with the attack on our judicial system.\" Hunter, meanwhile, recently name-checked Dunn during a tirade against Democratic operatives during a recent interview on YouTube show Channel 5. He said Dunn \"made $40 or $50 million\" off of work on behalf of the Democratic Party, while going further in criticism of others like David Axelrod and James Carville. Notably, however, Dunn was among those who continued to defend Biden after his debate – while criticizing fellow Democrats' reaction to it. \"It was a bad debate, but it didn’t feel catastrophic at all, certainly in terms of voters,\" Dunn told Politico Magazine in Aug. 2024, noting she was watching the debate at home while monitoring voters' reactions in real time. \"What did change it was 24 days of unremitting negative, horrible attacks on Joe Biden. . . . From his own party and from the press,\" Dunn said. She went further in that interview, calling the public criticism of Biden \"bullying\" while arguing that it was led by the media rather than voters themselves. LONGTIME BIDEN AIDE SAYS HE STOOD TO EARN UP TO $8M HAD PRESIDENT WON RE-ELECTION \"[T]he data still didn’t support this at all. We were looking at it and we were not seeing huge changes. But we were seeing an environment in the press that was just unremittingly negative. And nobody was covering Trump whatsoever,\" Dunn said. \"I went to Wisconsin with [Biden] for an event, and people felt very strongly about the bullying. They didn’t like it, and voters didn’t like it. They felt that it was unfair and that it was wrong. So you had a lot of different things going on here. You know, clearly there were leaders of the party who decided to go ahead and go very public. And that gave permission to other people to go public.\" Before joining Biden's 2020 campaign and later his White House as a senior advisor, Dunn was known as a close ally of former President Barack Obama, having aided both his 2008 and 2012 campaigns. Both she and her husband worked in the Obama administration. Dunn served as White House communications director in 2009 and Bauer as White House counsel from 2010 to 2011. Dunn spent time before and after that as a consultant at public affairs firm SKDK, raising questions at the time about her influence with both outside actors and those in Obama's inner circle. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The New York Times reported in 2012 that Dunn had visited more than 100 times since leaving her communications job there. That report also had White House officials denying any conflicts of interest on the part of Dunn or the administration.

His last day was July 31. \n\nIn an interview with Fox News Digital, Kessler revealed that his final days at The Post weren’t too somber — thanks to all the “caking.”\n\n“It was sugar overload because, you know, the tradition in newspapers is what we call caking, where it is a little celebration with cake served,” Kessler told Fox News Digital. \n\nKessler said his colleagues held a “very nice event” for him and shared kind words, including some located in Asia who woke up in the middle of the night and were “beamed in” on Zoom to participate. Kessler previously served as a State Department reporter before becoming the Fact Checker. \n\nHowever, he was far from the only outgoing “Postie” being celebrated. \n\n“But it was literally one caking after another,” Kessler said. “I mean, as we walked in for my event, they were packing up the leftover cake from the previous event. And as my wife remarked, as we walked through the newsroom to the place where they were holding my event, there was literally every conference room was filled with a caking, with people celebrating people who were leaving. So it was a very strange sugar high one got on your last day.”\n\nKessler let out a belly laugh at the idea that The Post was giving so much business to one lucky bakery in Washington, D.C., as he speculated all the cakes were coming from the same bakery, though he didn’t know which one. \n\n“But the caking is such a newspaper cliché,” Kessler said. “I mean, one of my favorite movies is the movie ‘Spotlight,’ which is about The Boston Globe, and it opens with a caking. It was kind of like an inside journalism joke to open with a caking where people were eating this cake and they each have kind of awkward, strange, funny remarks that people make about the person that’s leaving.”\n\n“So that was the last day. Caking, after caking, after caking, after caking,” he added. \n\nThe Washington Post had just concluded a round of buyouts, targeting the most senior staffers. The Post, which has struggled financially in recent years, has had multiple iterations of what it calls the Voluntary Separation Program (VSP). But as Kessler noted in his Substack piece shedding light on what led to his departure, this was going to be the “last buyout,” according to what a senior editor told him, and that any necessary staff reductions in the future would be layoffs. \n\nBut not everyone who has left The Post in recent months was for a buyout. Many landed jobs at other news outlets while others resigned in protest over decisions made by the paper’s billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos. Bezos sparked newsroom turmoil last October when he pulled The Post’s forthcoming endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the presidential election. He fueled further consternation in February by launching a new mission for the editorial pages to promote “personal liberties and free markets” and vowing not to publish pieces opposing those principles. \n\nThe Post has lost a significant portion of its biggest talent and high-profile journalists over the past year, Kessler being among them. However, some departures were more painful for the newsroom. \n\nKessler cited a trio of top editors who announced their exits within a two-month span that took the biggest hit on newsroom morale; Matea Gold, The Post’s managing editor who was poached by The New York Times to become its Washington editor, Philip Rucker, The Post’s national editor who joined CNN as its senior vice president of editorial strategy and news, and Griff Witte, The Post’s democracy editor who became The Atlantic’s managing editor.\n\nGold, in particular, Kessler noted, was the one who “everyone thought should have been editor” of The Post.\n\n“Those three were the future leaders of The Washington Post,” Kessler said. “You could imagine any one of them running the newspaper at one point.

Barlow, a partner at Doyle, Barlow & Mazard, said the transaction “surely raises competition concerns,” because it could potentially give Disney greater control over televised sports carriage and reduce competition.\n\n“The deal could potentially result in higher costs for consumers, as Disney’s dominance in sports media could limit options and drive up prices for streaming services or game access,” Barlow said.\n\nThe Justice Department is expected to conduct a substantive review of the new ESPN-NFL transaction, according to one source familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. Another source said obtaining U.S. antitrust clearance could take up to 12 months.\n\nESPN and the NFL declined comment.\n\nThe expected review comes as the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division is examining a separate deal Disney reached earlier this year to acquire a controlling stake in the sports streaming service Fubo TV. The division demanded further information from the companies in March to examine whether the deal would unduly concentrate the market for sports streaming.\n\nMeanwhile, the issue of rising costs for fans as games migrate to streaming services has reached the Senate, where the Commerce Committee held a hearing in May.\n\n“In an era of deep partisan division, sports might be the most powerful cultural unifier we have,” said Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who chairs the committee, noting it brings together Americans whether they’re watching from their couches or in the stands. “But those millions of fans are asking a simple question: ‘Why does it seem to be getting harder — and more expensive — to just watch the game?'”\n\nJohn Bergmayer, legal director of the non-profit Public Knowledge, voiced the same concerns.\n\n“The proliferation of streaming services — and the fragmentation of content between them — means that the costs of watching streaming video are rising, and for many people can approach what they were paying on their cable bill,” said Bergmayer in testimony to the committee. “Some viewers feel like they finally broke free of the cable bundle only to watch it re-forming (before) their eyes.”\n\nESPN STREAMING SERVICE\n\nThe NFL has done outreach to 30 congressional offices to discuss the terms of its deal with ESPN and how it would result in greater consumer choice, according to one of the sources.\n\nUnder the agreement, ESPN would be able to add the NFL Network to its breadth of sports programming and incorporate it as part of its ESPN-branded streaming service. ESPN also plans to merge its fantasy football offering with that of the NFL.\n\nESPN also will be able to distribute the NFL’s RedZone to cable and satellite TV distributors, along with its other channels. The NFL will retain streaming rights to NFL RedZone, which is available online through YouTube TV.\n\nDisney won swift approval for its $71 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets in 2018, during President Donald Trump’s first term, though it was required to divest Fox’s 22 regional sports networks to address competition concerns. At the time, Trump called to congratulate the Fox’s Rupert Murdoch on the deal.\n\n“It was worked out in record time,” said Barlow, adding that this time around, he expects the Justice Department “to take a close look before approving the deal.”\n\nOne recent media deal, the $8.4 billion merger of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, became bogged down in a lengthy regulatory review, as President Donald Trump sued Paramount, claiming the CBS News program “60 Minutes” deceptively edited an interview with his Democratic rival for the White House, former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission approved the transaction within days of Trump receiving a $16 million settlement, though FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said the civil suit and regulatory review were unrelated.\n\nPolitics could complicate the deal. Some sports industry insiders pointed to Trump’s threats to interfere with a deal to build a new football stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the local NFL team, now known as the Commanders, changes its name back to Redskins, which was abandoned after decades of criticism that it was a racial slur.\n\nESPN is currently 80 percent owned by ABC Inc as an indirect subsidiary of Disney, with the other 20% owned by Hearst. If the deal is approved, ABC’s stake would drop to 72 percent and Hearst would fall to 18 percent to grant the NFL a 10 percent stake.","summary":"ESPN's deal for NFL media assets faces DOJ scrutiny amid concerns over sports streaming costs.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/07/business/espn-nfl-deal-faces-regulatory-hurdles/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/newspress-collage-25kn0h5dn-1754579316296.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1754565026&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/R0i8DtaG-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-07 16:20:43","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":349161288,"title":"Eva Longoria's loudmouthed virtue signaling backfires spectacularly as Spanish town enacts Muslim crackdown","text":"Eva Longoria's loudmouthed virtue signaling backfires spectacularly as Spanish town enacts Muslim crackdown\n\nREAD MORE: Spanish town bans Muslim religious festivals provoking outcry \n\nBy T.

Geoff Duncan, who served as a Republican, has formally switched over to the Democrat side, asserting that his journey to the left started well before 2020.\n\n“My journey to becoming a Democrat started well before Donald Trump tried to steal the 2020 election in Georgia,” Duncan said on social media, stating that his shift was “centered around my daily struggle to love my neighbor, as a Republican.”\n\nDuncan — who served as lieutenant governor of the Peach State from 2019 until 2023 — linked to his op-ed in The Atlantic Journal-Constitution, where he explained that he felt he was unable to properly love his neighbor by being a Republican:\n\nMy time in elected office has taught me the most effective way to love your neighbor on a mass scale is through prudent public policy. Authoring the now $75 million rural hospital tax credit as a state representative and then later partnering with Democrats as lieutenant governor to successfully pass hate crimes legislation has helped give me that rewarding perspective.\n\nHe bashed Republican efforts to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in current welfare programs, pointing to budget cuts of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the “program’s effectiveness to continue to help feed hungry kids at school through free and reduced cost meals.” He also pointed to other common leftist talking points, including Medicaid, gun control, and illegal immigration.\n\n“Recent immigration policies have turned into a lesson on how not to love your neighbor,” he claimed, asserting that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations are akin to “military style raids on undocumented but law-abiding families for the sole purpose of creating a feeding frenzy on social media,” deeming them the “epitome of heartless, not to mention pointless.”\n\nHe made no mention of the fact that the vast majority of those arrested by ICE are the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens with rap sheets including crimes against children, rape, murder, and more.\n\nDuncan then concluded that the solution is to “secure the border, identify and deport undocumented immigrants guilty of a felony and offer a pathway to citizenship to everyone else. Problem solved.”\n\n“The list of reasons why I’m now a Democrat continues to grow,” he added. “Most importantly, my decision puts me in the best possible position each day to love my neighbor.”\n\nThis switch should come as no real surprise.

Marjorie Taylor Greene. \n\n“She’s very jealous of me,” Loomer testified during a deposition in her lawsuit against HBO talk show host Bill Maher, according to Puck. “Trump’s staff told me that they can’t stand Marjorie Taylor Greene.”\n\nThe lawsuit stems from Maher joking that President Donald Trump may have slept with Loomer, an Islamophobe and conspiracy theorist. The audience's groaning response prompted a federal judge to reason that they may have interpreted the claim as factual rather than as a joke, leading the suit to enter the discovery process. \n\nLast year, Maher suggested that Loomer may be in an “arranged marriage” with Trump. \n\n“We did an editorial here a few years ago ... it was basically, who’s Trump f***ing? Because I said, you know, it’s not nobody. He’s been a dog for too long, and it’s not Melania. I think we may have our answer this week. I think it might be Laura Loomer,” said Maher. \n\nLoomer has recently been getting senior Trump administration officials fired by digging up old social media posts, going through their employment records, and looking at their past political donations. In April, several members of the National Security Council were fired after Loomer met with Trump. \n\nLast month, the general counsel of the National Security Agency, April Falcon Doss, was fired just a day after Loomer met the president in the Oval Office.\n\nShe also attacked the top vaccine regulator, Vinay Prasad, as a “progressive leftist saboteur undermining President Trump’s Food and Drug Administration.” Prasad later left his position.\n\nIn May, she said that former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz had been “Loomered” following his ouster. Waltz has since been nominated to serve as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nLoomer believes that her goal of getting a job in the Trump White House was quashed not because of her litany of racist comments and spreading of conspiracy theories, but by Maher’s comments. \n\nGreene and Loomer have exchanged verbal blows in the past. Greene blasted Loomer as “extremely racist” after Loomer posted that if former Vice President Kamala Harris, who is half Indian, would win the 2024 election, “the White House will smell like curry and White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.”\n\n“This does not represent President Trump,” said Greene. \n\nPuck obtained a copy of Loomer’s deposition with an HBO attorney before it was sealed by a Florida judge. Loomer reportedly said during the proceedings that Maher started a “media frenzy” that ended her chances of a White House role. Loomer added that before that, she had visited Mar-a-Lago, “20, 30 times” and had unrestricted access to the president. \n\nHBO’s lawyers remained skeptical of Loomer’s assertion, with one attorney asking her, “Other than Bill Maher, can you name a single human being on all of Planet Earth that believes what Bill Maher said?”\n\n“It’s up for interpretation,” said Loomer. \n\nAttorney Kate Bolger then moved to show, via her questioning, how Loomer’s past Islamophobic and other controversial statements could have contributed to her being denied a White House role. She cited her attacks on Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker and his trans and bathroom policies and her intense dislike of Greene. \n\nIt was at this point that Loomer accused Greene of jealousy and alleged that the White House “can’t stand” her. \n\nShe went on to accuse Bolger of being a “Democratic lawyer who represents fake news media.” \n\nLoomer told The Washington Post that offers of White House jobs were “snatched away in acts of professional jealousy.”","summary":"Loomer testifies in HBO lawsuit deposition that a high-profile congresswoman is disliked, despite her outspoken loyalty to the president","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/laura-loomer-marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-b2803769.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/21/16/01/GettyImages-2147828797.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/5Oje7Dzy-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-07 15:18:41","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.265},{"id":349059338,"title":"Paramount closes $8 billion merger with Skydance after settling '60 Minutes' lawsuit - Reuters","text":"CompaniesParamount Global\n\nAug 7 (Reuters) - Paramount Global and Skydance Media have completed their $8.4 billion merger that was announced more than a year ago, the companies said, capping a long-drawn deal process marked by political scrutiny and shareholder concerns.\n\nRenamed \"Paramount Skydance Corp\", the company's Class B shares will start trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol PSKY from Thursday.\n\nThe merger brings together a major player in the industry with a sprawling global distribution network and a prized film and TV library, including classics such as \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\", with Skydance's production and technological capabilities.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\n\"Today marks Day One of a new Paramount...the coming months will be defined by a series of focused efforts to re-engineer how our company operates, produces its creative content, and goes to market,\" said David Ellison, Chairman and CEO of the combined company.\n\nThe company will be structured into three business segments - studios, direct-to-consumer and TV media - with Ellison emphasizing the need to expand Paramount's technological capabilities, grow its streaming business and prioritize cash flow.\n\nThe merger came at a time when Paramount, like other legacy media players, was struggling with sagging traditional linear TV business as consumers shift to streaming platforms.

They can subscribe here.\n\nBy Daniela Altimari, Niels Lesniewski and Mary Ellen McIntire\n\nSixteen years ago, the song of the summer was “I Gotta Feeling” by the Black Eyed Peas, while the news story of the summer was the burgeoning tea party movement and the protests it sparked at congressional town hall meetings across the nation. \n\nSome gatherings grew so heated that punches were thrown, arrests were made and members of Congress were hanged in effigy. \n\nThis summer represents a distant echo of those days. Just as they did in August 2009, town hall meetings are giving the president’s detractors an outlet to register their disapproval of his agenda. Then, it was Republicans angry over Barack Obama’s health care overhaul; today, it’s Democrats outraged by Donald Trump’s recently enacted domestic policy bill.\n\nThen, like now, the other side accused well-funded outside groups of fomenting the protests while pretending they were grassroots efforts that sprung up organically.\n\nBut there are differences too. For one, social media was in its infancy in 2009; the first iPhone capable of shooting video came on the market in June of that year. These days, footage of town hall protests routinely trend on TikTok.\n\nAlso, unlike 2009, few GOP members are even holding town halls during this August recess. One who did, Nebraska Rep. Mike Flood, was confronted by more than 700 angry attendees who jeered and shouted at him for more than an hour at a town hall in Lincoln on Monday.\n\n“I think it’s somewhat cathartic for them to be able to have the opportunity to address their representative government,” Flood told NPR. “And I tell the police before I start … I do not want anybody removed or arrested. I want them to be able to say what they have to say. This part of the deal, this is the way people feel right now. Let’s let them do their thing and keep going.”\n\nTime will tell whether this summer’s town halls will fuel a lasting political realignment. Republicans rode a wave of tea party anger to reclaim control of Congress in 2010, and the movement laid the seeds for Trump’s ascendancy in 2016.\n\nAnd, hey, maybe time will tell whether 2025 does in fact have a song of the summer after all.\n\nStarting gate\n\nBrawl in the Bluegrass State: The increasingly bitter Republican primary for Kentucky’s open Senate seat features Rep. Andy Barr, a prodigious fundraiser whose House district includes Kentucky’s second-largest city; former state Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who enjoys broad name recognition after two statewide runs; and businessman Nate Morris, who is positioning himself as a political outsider. But looming over the race are two men who won’t be on the ballot: Trump and retiring longtime Sen. Mitch McConnell.\n\nRedistricting rundown: Texas Democrats stifled Republicans’ efforts to approve a new congressional map this week, but redistricting efforts are also on the table in several other states, which we ran down here. \n\nBlackburn for governor: Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn made official on Wednesday what was already widely expected: She’s running for governor of Tennessee. Blackburn immediately becomes the favorite in the race, although she faces a contested primary, with Rep. John W. Rose also in the hunt for the GOP nomination. \n\nMace for governor: GOP Rep. Nancy Mace came to Congress in 2021 with more moderate views on social issues such as LBGTQ rights and abortion but has since burnished an image as a conservative firebrand. On Monday, she joined the increasingly crowded Republican race for South Carolina governor. \n\n#NCSEN: Former Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley launched his campaign for North Carolina’s open Senate seat with the support of Trump and top Senate Republicans, setting the stage for a blockbuster general election matchup against Democratic former Gov. Roy Cooper. \n\n#IASEN: Des Moines school board chair Jackie Norris, who was chief of staff to former first lady Michelle Obama, has joined the crowded field of Democrats seeking to challenge GOP Sen. Joni Ernst. \n\n#GASEN: In Georgia, former University of Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley is the latest entrant into the Republican primary to challenge vulnerable Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff. Dooley reportedly has the backing of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who opted against a Senate run earlier this year.\n\nTapping the feds: The FBI has agreed to Texas Sen. John Cornyn’s request to track down dozens of Democratic legislators who fled the Lone Star State in recent days as a way to thwart the GOP’s redistricting plan, The New York Times reported. \n\nHouse launches (Democratic version): Anthony Driver, executive director of the SEIU Illinois State Council, joined the packed Democratic race to succeed retiring Rep. Danny K. Davis in the state’s 7th District. In South Carolina’s 1st District, Coast Guard veteran and attorney Mac Deford is the latest Democrat to seek Mace’s newly opened seat.

'He was politically incorrect, a shock jock and he was the best at that. And then, this guy pivoted into this woke clown. \n\n'What I find fascinating here is that I think it's the return of Donald Trump and the culture change around Donald Trump that is why SiriusXM is moving off of Howard Stern. The culture no longer supports something as inauthentic as Howard Stern.' \n\nTrump himself weighed in on Stern's future earlier this week when he delivered his own take on why the shock jock may be facing cancellation.\n\n'Howard Stern is a name I haven't heard - I used to do his show, we used to have fun - but I haven't heard that name in a long time,' Trump told reporters Wednesday in the Oval Office. 'What happened he got terminated?' the president asked.\n\nStern has not yet been terminated, but that didn't stop Trump.\n\n'You know when he went down? You know when he went down?' Trump then said. 'When he endorsed Hillary Clinton, he lost his audience. People said, get me a break. He went down when he endorsed Hillary Clinton.'\n\nClinton was Trump's 2016 opponent.\n\nStern also had Trump's 2024 rival, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, on his show last year.\n\nThe Daily Mail first reported on Tuesday that Stern's SiriusXM show could be set to end after the shock jock's current contract is up. \n\nA show insider said: 'He may do a 1-2 year contract if they can meet him where he wants financially. He doesn’t want to pull the plug on his employees like this.'\n\nA separate source said Stern was considering 'parting ways' with SiriusXM - and that his staff of 'around 95' writers and producers had only recently heard about Stern's indecision over the show's future.\n\nThey added the star 'will likely sell his catalogue of shows to replay' on uncensored channels Howard 100 and Howard 101.\n\n'He is off in the summer but this year has been saying \"maybe I should retire\"', the source said.\n\nIt is possible Stern could also return for specials with SiriusXM.\n\nThe source claimed Stern was also displeased over SiriusXM 'leaning heavily' on fellow radio star Andy Cohen.\n\nDaily Mail has contacted representatives for Howard Stern, SiriusXM and Andy Cohen for comment and has yet to hear back.\n\nDubbed the 'King of all Media' - Stern first launched The Howard Stern Show in 1986 on terrestrial radio.\n\nStern decided to take on the challenge of pulling together interviews over the years where he was able to draw out shocking confessions. \n\nHowever, in recent years, the radio star's career fell from having 20 million listeners a day to to figures fans believe are as low as 125,000. He has predominantly broadcast from his home over the past five years, citing fears over COVID-19.","summary":"Stern, 71, has hosted the second incarnation of The Howard Stern Show since 2006, but his near 20-year run on SiriusXM's airwaves is in jeopardy as the end of his $500million five-year contract looms.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-14979897/jason-whitlock-Howard-Stern-siriusxm-contract-cancellation.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/07/14/101007887-0-image-m-14_1754574310302.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-07 13:57:39","author":"Editor,Isabel Baldwin","authors":["Editor","Isabel Baldwin"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.451},{"id":349031684,"title":"Paramount completes merger with Skydance","text":"Paramount completed its $8 billion merger with Skydance on Tuesday, marking a major shakeup in the entertainment industry.David Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount, laid out his vision for the company following the merger. \"My vision is to honor exceptional storytelling while modernizing how we make and deliver content to support the world's top creative talent, enhance experiences for audiences worldwide, and create sustainable value for our shareholders,\" he said.

Barlow, a partner at Doyle, Barlow & Mazard, said the transaction \"surely raises competition concerns,\" because it could potentially give Disney greater control over televised sports carriage and reduce competition.\n\n\"The deal could potentially result in higher costs for consumers, as Disney's dominance in sports media could limit options and drive up prices for streaming services or game access,\" Barlow said.\n\nThe Justice Department is expected to conduct a substantive review of the new ESPN-NFL transaction, according to one source familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. Another source said obtaining U.S. antitrust clearance could take up to 12 months.\n\nESPN and the NFL declined comment.\n\nThe expected review comes as the Justice Department's Antitrust Division is examining a separate deal Disney reached earlier this year to acquire a controlling stake in the sports streaming service Fubo TV. The division demanded further information from the companies in March to examine whether the deal would unduly concentrate the market for sports streaming.\n\nMeanwhile, the issue of rising costs for fans as games migrate to streaming services has reached the Senate, where the Commerce Committee held a hearing in May.\n\n\"In an era of deep partisan division, sports might be the most powerful cultural unifier we have,\" said Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who chairs the committee, noting it brings together Americans whether they're watching from their couches or in the stands. \"But those millions of fans are asking a simple question: 'Why does it seem to be getting harder - and more expensive - to just watch the game?'\"\n\nJohn Bergmayer, legal director of the non-profit Public Knowledge, voiced the same concerns.\n\n\"The proliferation of streaming services - and the fragmentation of content between them - means that the costs of watching streaming video are rising, and for many people can approach what they were paying on their cable bill,\" said Bergmayer in testimony to the committee. \"Some viewers feel like they finally broke free of the cable bundle only to watch it re-forming (before) their eyes.\"\n\nESPN STREAMING SERVICE\n\nThe NFL has done outreach to 30 congressional offices to discuss the terms of its deal with ESPN and how it would result in greater consumer choice, according to one of the sources.\n\nUnder the agreement, ESPN would be able to add the NFL Network to its breadth of sports programming and incorporate it as part of its ESPN-branded streaming service. ESPN also plans to merge its fantasy football offering with that of the NFL. \n\nESPN also will be able to distribute the NFL's RedZone to cable and satellite TV distributors, along with its other channels. The NFL will retain streaming rights to NFL RedZone, which is available online through YouTube TV. \n\nDisney won swift approval for its $71 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets in 2018, during President Donald Trump's first term, though it was required to divest Fox's 22 regional sports networks to address competition concerns. At the time, Trump called to congratulate the Fox's Rupert Murdoch on the deal.\n\n\"It was worked out in record time,\" said Barlow, adding that this time around, he expects the Justice Department \"to take a close look before approving the deal.\"\n\nOne recent media deal, the $8.4 billion merger of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, became bogged down in a lengthy regulatory review, as President Donald Trump sued Paramount, claiming the CBS News program \"60 Minutes\" deceptively edited an interview with his Democratic rival for the White House, former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission approved the transaction within days of Trump receiving a $16 million settlement, though FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said the civil suit and regulatory review were unrelated.\n\nPolitics could complicate the deal. Some sports industry insiders pointed to Trump's threats to interfere with a deal to build a new football stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the local NFL team, now known as the Commanders, changes its name back to Redskins, which was abandoned after decades of criticism that it was a racial slur.\n\nESPN is currently 80 per cent owned by ABC Inc as an indirect subsidiary of Disney, with the other 20 per cent owned by Hearst. If the deal is approved, ABC's stake would drop to 72 per cent and Hearst would fall to 18 per cent to grant the NFL a 10 per cent stake.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/analysisespn-nfl-deal-faces-regulatory-hurdles-5283226","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--nBS0YqZu--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2025-08-07t133720z_4_lynxmpel760sd_rtroptp_3_football-nfl-kc-no.jpg?itok","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-07 13:28:10","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":349021686,"title":"Trump says he doesn't trust the jobs data—but Wall Street and economists do","text":"The monthly jobs report is already closely-watched on Wall Street and in Washington but has taken on a new importance after President Donald Trump on Friday fired the official who oversees it.\n\nTrump claimed that June's employment figures were “RIGGED” to make him and other Republicans “look bad,” yet he provided no evidence. The firing of Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics appointed by former President Joe Biden, followed Friday's jobs report that showed hiring was weak in July and had come to nearly a standstill in May and June, right after Trump rolled out sweeping tariffs.\n\nEconomists and Wall Street investors have long considered the job figures reliable, with share prices and bond yields often reacting sharply when they are released. Yet Friday’s revisions were unusually large — the largest, outside of a recession, in five decades. And the surveys used to compile the report are facing challenges from declining response rates.\n\nNonetheless, that hasn't led most economists to doubt them.\n\n“The bottom line for me is, I wouldn’t take the low collection rate as any evidence that the numbers are less reliable,” Omair Sharif, founder and chief economist at Inflation Insights, a consulting firm, said.\n\nRelated | Trump's solution to latest bad jobs report: Shoot the messenger\n\nHeather Boushey, a top economic adviser in the Biden White House, noted that without Trump's firing of McEntarfer, there would be more focus on last week's data, which points to a slowing economy.\n\n“We’re having this conversation about made-up issues to distract us from what the data is showing,\" Boushey said. “Revisions of this magnitude in a negative direction may indicate bad things to come for the labor market.”\n\nHere are some things to know about the jobs report:\n\nEconomists and Wall Street trust the data\n\nMost economists say that the Bureau of Labor Statistics is a nonpolitical agency staffed by people obsessed with getting the numbers right. The only political appointee is the commissioner, who doesn't see the data until it's finalized, two days before it is issued to the public.\n\nErica Groshen, the BLS commissioner from 2013 to 2017, said she suggested different language in the report to \"liven it up\", but was shot down. She was told that if asked to describe a cup as half-empty or half-full, BLS says “it is an eight ounce cup with four ounces of liquid.”\n\nRelated | Trump wonders why people 'trust numbers' after lousy jobs report\n\nThe revised jobs data that has attracted Trump's ire is actually more in line with other figures than before the revision. For example, payroll processor ADP uses data from its millions of clients to calculate its own jobs report, and it showed a sharp hiring slowdown in May and June that is closer to the revised BLS data.\n\nTrump and his White House have a long track record of celebrating the jobs numbers — when they are good.\n\nSecuring the data\n\nRigging the numbers would be difficult. Hundreds of economists and statisticians are involved in compiling the monthly jobs report, and they follow “transparent, well-established methodologies,’’ Heidi Shierholz, the Labor Department’s chief economist in the Obama administration, wrote in a commentary Friday.\n\n“It is very, very difficult to tamper or to interfere with these numbers,’’ Elaine Chao, Labor secretary in the George W. Bush administration, told CNBC Monday.\n\nRelated | Trump cronies cope up a storm over disastrous job numbers\n\nIn the week before the numbers are released, she said, “the process is very much locked down’’ with about 40 people involved in the final preparations. “If anything were to be awry, I think one of these 40 people in the final analysis would have spoken up,’’ Chao said.\n\nThe BLS commissioner only sees the numbers after they are final — usually the Tuesday before the report comes out on Friday. The White House Council of Economic Advisers gets a look and a briefing from the commissioner or BLS staff on Thursday, Groshen said.\n\nThese are the figures Trump is attacking\n\nTrump has focused on the revisions to the May and June data, which on Friday were revised lower, with job gains in May reduced to 19,000 from 144,000, and for June to just 14,000 from 147,000. Every month's jobs data is revised in the following two months.\n\nTrump also repeated a largely inaccurate attack from the campaign about an annual revision last August, which reduced total employment in the United States by 818,000, or about 0.5%. The government also revises employment figures every year.\n\nTrump charged the annual revision was released before the 2024 presidential election to “boost” Vice President Kamala Harris's \"chances of Victory,\" yet it was two months before the election and widely reported at the time that the revision lowered hiring during the Biden-Harris administration and pointed to a weaker economy.\n\nHere's why the government revises the data\n\nThe monthly revisions occur because many companies that respond to the government's surveys send their data in late, or correct the figures they've already submitted. The proportion of companies sending in their data later has risen in the past decade.\n\nEvery year, the BLS does an additional revision based on actual job counts that are derived from state unemployment insurance records. Those figures cover 95% of U.S. businesses and aren't derived from a survey but are not available in real time.\n\nRelated | Trump comforts himself with new bonkers theory to explain his economy\n\nBetsey Stevenson, a University of Michigan professor and former chief economist at the Labor Department, stressed that the government also needs to be able to release the data in a timely manner, so that companies have a sense on a monthly basis about how the economy is faring. The revisions help to ensure the timely release while improving accuracy over time, she said, adding that lawmakers need to make investments to modernize data collection.\n\n“The trade offs between cost, speed, and accuracy are decisions made by Congress,” she said. “The president seems frustrated by his own party’s policy choices around national statistics.”\n\nFactors that cause revisions\n\nFiguring out how many new jobs have been added or lost each month is more complicated than it may sound. For example, if one person takes a second job, should you focus on the number of jobs, which has increased, or the number of employed people, which hasn't? (The government measures both: The unemployment rate is based on how many people either have or don't have jobs, while the number of jobs added or lost is counted separately).\n\nEach month, the government surveys about 121,000 businesses and government agencies at over 630,000 locations — including multiple locations for the same business — covering about one-third of all workers.\n\nStill, the government also has to make estimates: What if a company goes out of business? It likely won't fill out any forms showing the jobs lost. And what about new businesses? They can take a while to get on the government's radar.\n\nRelated | Trump's spin on economy spirals during unhinged interview\n\nThe BLS seeks to capture these trends by estimating their impact on employment. Those estimates can be wrong, of course, until they are fixed by the annual revisions.\n\nThe revisions are often larger around turning points in the economy. For example, when the economy is growing, there may be more startups than the government expects, so revisions will be higher. If the economy is slowing or slipping into a recession, the revisions may be larger on the downside.\n\nRevisions seem to be getting bigger\n\nThe revisions to May and June's job totals, which reduced hiring by a total of 258,000, were the largest — outside recessions — since 1967, according to economists at Goldman Sachs.\n\nKevin Hassett, Trump's top economic adviser, went on NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday and said, “What we’ve seen over the last few years is massive revisions to the jobs numbers.”\n\nHassett blamed a sharp drop in response rates to the government's surveys during and after the pandemic: “When COVID happened, because response rates went down a lot, then revision rates skyrocketed.”\n\nYet calculations by Ernie Tedeschi, an economic adviser to the Biden administration, show that while revisions spiked after the pandemic, they have since declined and are much smaller than in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nOther concerns about the government's data\n\nMany economists and statisticians have sounded the alarm about things like declining response rates for years. A decade ago, about 60% of companies surveyed by BLS responded. Now, only about 40% do.\n\nThe decline has been an international phenomenon, particularly since COVID. The United Kingdom has even suspended publication of an official unemployment rate because of falling responses.\n\nAnd earlier this year the BLS said that it was cutting back on its collection of inflation data because of the Trump administration's hiring freeze, raising concerns about the robustness of price data just as economists are trying to gauge the impact of tariffs on inflation.\n\nRelated | New jobs numbers hint at Great Recession 2.0\n\nU.S. government statistical agencies have seen an inflation-adjusted 16% drop in funding since 2009, according to a July report from the American Statistical Association.\n\n“We are at an inflection point,” the report said. “To meet current and future challenges requires thoughtful, well-planned investment ... In contrast, what we have observed is uncoordinated and unplanned reductions with no visible plan for the future.","summary":"The monthly jobs report is already closely-watched on Wall Street and in Washington but has taken on a new importance after President Donald Trump on Friday fired the official who oversees it.\n\n\n\nTrump claimed that June's employment figures were “RIGGED” to make him and other Republicans “look bad,” yet he provided no evidence.

The verdict – including my own – was generally that this theory was overblown.\nThere were anecdotes, yes, but it didn’t seem to be an especially measurable phenomenon.\nMore than six months in, that could be changing, at least somewhat.\nIt’s probably still too simple to say that lots of Trump supporters regret their votes. But to appropriate a phrase you might have heard from your parents once upon a time: Many Trump voters aren’t mad (or fully regretful); they’re just disappointed.\nA new poll from the University of Massachusetts Amherst is one of the best gauges of this to date.\nIt found just 69 percent of 2024 Trump voters agreed that they are “very confident that I made the right choice.”\nThat’s fewer than the 78 percent of Kamala Harris voters who said the same of her. It’s also down slightly from the 74 percent of Trump voters who said they were very confident in their vote back in April.\nThat doesn’t mean the other 31 percent of Trump voters are full of regret. Indeed, most of them (19 percent of the total) said they’re still “confident” in their votes but that they had “some concerns.”\nBut about 1 in 10 Trump voters said either that they regretted their votes to some degree, had “mixed feelings,” or wish they hadn’t voted. That group has grown slightly since April.\nAnd all told, 14 percent of Trump voters said if they could redo their 2024 votes, they would either vote for Harris (6 percent), vote third-party (5 percent) or not vote at all (3 percent). That’s more than the 8 percent of Harris votes who would have picked a different option than their candidate.\nIt’s just one poll, but the numbers do make sense in context. And other data gestures in this direction, too.\nSince many of those stories were written earlier this year, Trump’s popularity has continued to wane – to the point where he now owns the worst early first-term and second-term approval ratings in modern history, according to Gallup.\nAnd recently, Trump and his administration have taken a number of actions that seemed to test the tolerance of even his most devoted supporters.\nThat includes his military strikes on Iran (which many influential MAGA types initially balked at), his increasing support for arming Ukraine (which polls suggest Republicans have opposed nearly 2-to-1) and passing a historically unpopular agenda bill featuring Medicaid cuts (a bill that CNN polling showed only 30 percent of Republicans strongly supported).\nMany Republicans have also questioned Trump’s tariff policies and said he’s not focused enough on inflation.\nBut perhaps Trump’s most problematic episode with his base is his administration’s ongoing Epstein files fiasco.\nThe UMass poll shows just 38 percent of Trump voters said the administration has handled the situation well, and 33 percent say it’s hiding information. That’s 1 in 3 Trump voters who think there’s a cover-up, to some degree. These numbers echo other data that suggest this is by far Trump’s worst issue with his base.\nAll of it has combined to lead some prominent influencers who had supported Trump to distance themselves from him.\nIn other words, there’s increasingly plenty for his supporters to dislike, depending upon what’s important to them. His approval ratings on a series of issues include small but significant GOP defections. Last month I called it a “looming malaise.”\nAnd the idea that a small but significant number of Trump voters are at least having second thoughts about their votes tracks with other data.\nMultiple polls, for instance, have shown an especially sharp drop in Trump’s approval among young adults. A recent CBS News-YouGov poll showed adults under 30 have gone from 55 percent approving of Trump in February to 28 percent last month.\nCBS data last month also showed 16 percent of Republicans said Trump is doing different things than he promised on the campaign trail – which could certainly signify discontent.\nAnd finally is a Yahoo News-YouGov poll last month. Rather than ask about personal voter regret, it asked people whether they knew other people who regretted their votes. It found 17 percent of Trump voters said they knew a regretful fellow Trump voter. (That was double the eight percent of Harris voters who said they knew a regretful Harris voter.)\nWhy is that significant? Well, for one, it suggests there are enough publicly regretful Trump voters that nearly one in five Trump voters have at least encountered one.\nBut more than that, it might actually be a better measure of voter regret than straight-up asking people about their own views.\nPeople, after all, don’t love the idea of admitting they personally made a mistake. Some political scientists believe questions like this are better at unearthing hidden trends, because they allow people to hint at their own views while keeping the sentiment at arm’s length. “I don’t regret my vote, but I know people who do,” might suggest the person in question has some qualms of their own.\nWhatever the case, it’s certainly something worth watching right now.

The verdict – including my own – was generally that this theory was overblown.\n\nThere were anecdotes, yes, but it didn’t seem to be an especially measurable phenomenon.\n\nMore than six months in, that could be changing, at least somewhat.\n\nIt’s probably still too simple to say that lots of Trump supporters regret their votes. But to appropriate a phrase you might have heard from your parents once upon a time: Many Trump voters aren’t mad (or fully regretful); they’re just disappointed.\n\nA new poll from the University of Massachusetts Amherst is one of the best gauges of this to date.\n\nIt found just 69 percent of 2024 Trump voters agreed that they are “very confident that I made the right choice.”\n\nThat’s fewer than the 78 percent of Kamala Harris voters who said the same of her. It’s also down slightly from the 74 percent of Trump voters who said they were very confident in their vote back in April.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the other 31 percent of Trump voters are full of regret. Indeed, most of them (19 percent of the total) said they’re still “confident” in their votes but that they had “some concerns.”\n\nBut about 1 in 10 Trump voters said either that they regretted their votes to some degree, had “mixed feelings,” or wish they hadn’t voted. That group has grown slightly since April.\n\nAnd all told, 14 percent of Trump voters said if they could redo their 2024 votes, they would either vote for Harris (6 percent), vote third-party (5 percent) or not vote at all (3 percent). That’s more than the 8 percent of Harris votes who would have picked a different option than their candidate.\n\nIt’s just one poll, but the numbers do make sense in context.

However, the false claims about Brigitte Macron first went viral in 2021.Ahead of France's 2022 presidential election, self-proclaimed journalist Natacha Rey alleged that Brigitte Macron was assigned male at birth and named Jean Michel Trogneux — which is Brigitte's brother's name — during a four-hour YouTube interview with spiritual medium Amandine Roy. However, this is not an isolated incident. Many other female public figures, such as former US First Lady Michelle Obama, New Zealand's former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and former US Vice President Kamala Harris, have also been victims of similar transphobic social media campaigns, which academics have dubbed \"tranvestigations\". The rise of 'tranvestigations'Transvestigations emerged on social media, particularly image-based ones such as X, Instagram and TikTok, because of individuals who seek to uncover some kind of hidden transgender identity among cisgender celebrities, according to Lexi Webster, associate professor of digital culture at the University of Southampton.Users post pictures where they examine \"the size and shape of a person's shoulders, of skulls and jaws, but they also look at people's gait, as well as their genitals,\" Webster said, which they accompany with conspiracy theories. The fake claims about Brigitte Macron have become so widespread partly because they build on the public's perception that politicians are inherently deceitful.Other factors include \"the conspiratorial element which is transphobic and is underpinned by discourses that there is some kind of trans cabal that is seeking to take power over particular industries\", explained Webster.Candace Owens' preoccupation with Brigitte Macron has led other prominent figures, such as known conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, to also relay the claim.\"Barack Obama has been plagued with gay rumours for a long time, and this is embedded in those discourses of Michelle Obama secretly being trans, and Emmanuel Macron, who is also being discredited largely because of other elements of his relationship\", Webster told EuroVerify. \"Right-wing or alt-right users are fuelling these claims, but we also know many platforms are inundated with bots who construct and reconstruct discourses based on what they know works well, which creates an engagement trap as people like, comment and repost\", Webster added.However, even those who reshare the content to laugh at it also help keep it alive.\"The online satirical community which points out these kinds of networks of hate and reshares them to laugh at the absurdity also generates engagement\", Webster said.Fake news report about Brigitte Macron emerges onlineDespite there being no evidence to back any of the false claims about Brigitte Macron, they have with time become increasingly bold and innovative — both in style and substance — rather than dying down. For instance, in early July, a video styled as a TV news report surfaced on social media and garnered hundreds of thousands of views every time it was reposted. The video opens with shots of a crime scene, as a narrator alleges that a surgeon named François Faivre — who had supposedly planned on revealing information about Brigitte Macron's alleged gender reassignment surgery in a tell-all interview with a French tabloid — mysteriously fell out of a window in Paris on 29 June.However, the video, just as the claim, is fake. Through a reverse image search, EuroVerify traced the opening shots of the video to AFP footage available on YouTube, which showed a crime scene in Paris back in October 2022 — so not 29 June 2025. Furthermore, the surgeon in the video claims he worked at the American Hospital in Paris. The private healthcare practice told EuroVerify it had no records of a surgeon named François Faivre. Although the face of the fake surgeon could be a real person's, he barely blinks in the video, which points to the fact that his speech has likely been AI-generated.Despite the overwhelming evidence that the story of the surgeon is fake, conspiracy theories use tactful elements which sow doubt, such as the narrator's claims that Brigitte Macron underwent gender reassignment surgery at the American Hospital in Paris.This claim is intentional and appears to play on previously established stories, given that in 2019, Brigitte Macron sued Closer magazine for invading her private life, after the publication alleged that the country's first lady underwent a three-hour plastic surgery at the American Hospital of Paris in July. \"They take alleged medical evidence, for example, this person went into a hospital at this point, knowing that the person in question is not going to tell us what they were in hospital for\", Webster told EuroVerify.In this case, conspiracy theorists could be taking advantage of the fact that politicians and their partners rarely address plastic surgery rumours, \"in the political sphere there is also a desire not to come across as vain or shallow about appearance, beyond political appearance\", added Webster.\"No evidence is good enough to stop the rumour. Even if Brigitte Macron did share her birth certificate, online users could claim it has been forged or altered\", said Webster. \"Even if the Macrons win the defamation case against Candace Owens, I don't think there'll be any impact on the claims online.\"","summary":"Public female figures, such as former US First Lady Michelle Obama and New Zealand's former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, have also been accused of assigned male at birth.

ABC is ‘reviewing the liberal bias’ on The View. The VIEW,” she wrote. “The show with five women speaking the [sic] opinions - That’s the threat now.”\n\nAccording to O’Donnell, an uncited “they” (presumably the network) were “reviewing the bias” of the show, which she took to mean “code for – we’re gonna cancel it we’re just trying to soften you up first[.]” Adding: “Because it’s not enough to run the country into the ground You have to control what people SEE What they HEAR What they think[.]”\n\n(EDITOR’S NOTE: We’re trying to keep O’Donnell’s writings as close to how she typed them as we can. If you see odd capitalizations or punctuation, it’s how she meant for it to be seen. Apparently. Some period marks are added to ease reading.)\n\nIn describing how she thought The View posed a “threat” to the Trump administration, O’Donnell suggested the “they” thought it was “a little too much woman – a little too much truth […] Apparently, the truth is dangerous now[.]”\n\n“They say they want ‘balance.’ But what they mean is silence. Silence anything that doesn’t praise the orange messiah and his golden escalator of lies,” she asserted, without evidence.\n\nIn a pair of studies published last month, NewsBusters exposed the far-left bias of The View, a “news” program presented by ABC. Of the 102 guests that discussed politics on The View, all of them were liberals with ZERO conservatives. NewsBusters also showed that the news program had abandoned the practice of issuing legal notes at the same time they were pushing unfounded conspiracy theories about the Trump administration (like him rigging the 2024 election).\n\nO’Donnell laughably tried to claim there was no unified liberal bloc on The View by suggesting they couldn’t agree on practically anything: “And I’ve done THE VIEW – twice I know how hard it is to get four women to agree on lunch – let alone politics So don’t tell me The View is some radical leftist threat[.]”\n\nClearly, O’Donnell hadn’t watched the show in quite a while. In addition to NewsBusters’ studies, it was a big deal on the show when faux conservative co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin came out in support of former Vice President Kamala Harris for president; joining her five other co-hosts. Moderator Whoopi Goldberg, had also made it clear in the latter half of their 28th season that the show was meant to push Democratic Party talking points and work to get them elected to offices.\n\nInvoking phrases that warned of the Holocaust, O’Donnell continued: “First they came for the journalists Then the educators then the librarians [.] Now, it’s Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg[.]”\n\nIf you were to take O’Donnell’s word for it, The View was the only thing keeping America teetering the right side of the abyss:\n\nSo here’s my question: When they cancel The View— who’s gonna be left to say, “This is insane”?\n\nBecause this isn’t just about a TV show. It’s about what happens when powerful men decide they’ve hear enough from women.\n\nWhen they label truth as bias, and disagreement as danger, and they start scrubbing the airwaves of anyone who makes them uncomfortable.\n\nWhat they’re really trying to do is shut us up. All of us\nAnd we’ve seen what happens when women are silenced.\n History has shown us— over and over and over— that when women stop speaking, things fall apart.\n\n“Because the most dangerous sound in the world is a woman who knows what she’s talking about— and refuses to stop,” O’Donnell, the 9-11 truther, concluded.","summary":"In a Wednesday TikTok post that resembled the scribblings of a madman, “comedian” Rosie O’Donnell sought to warn her followers that her old haunt, ABC’s The View was about to be canceled because of their “liberal bias.” She proclaimed that it was another example of the “fascism” of “the orange messiah” (President Trump) trying to “silence” women with opinions, and invoked phrases used for warning about Nazism and the Holocaust.\n\n“You know what I just read today?

One of those colors is new, but without any official word from Apple yet, it's not clear exactly which one.\n\nYou may like\n\nAirPods said to get some nice free upgrades at WWDC 2025, including more gesture control and sleep detection\n\nMaybe AirPods Pro 3 really are coming this year, based on a hint in iOS 26\n\nThe iPhone 17 Air might come in these 4 colors – and there's an interesting claim about its chipset too\n\nThe Apple support document that's currently live lists green and amber as the two colors you'll see when charging your AirPods and their case, so it appears we're going to get two different variations on amber going forward.\n\nLights, charging, action\n\nThis is new in Beta 5 right ?! I’ve never seen it before. pic.twitter.com/GC8BP7nTmPAugust 6, 2025\n\nConsidering the AirPods case has such a simple indicator light, interpreting it is actually quite complicated – what it shows varies depending on whether it's connected to power, whether it's open or closed, and whether the AirPods are actually in it or not.\nDuring charging and with the case closed, for example, you can tap on the case to get a reading: charging (amber) or charged (green). If the case is open, isn't charging, and has your AirPods in them, amber means you've got less than a single charge on the earbuds.\nWe'll have to wait and see exactly how this new triple-light approach works in practice: presumably Apple will provide official documentation if the feature gets kept in the iOS 26 betas and makes it to the full release (due in September, with the iPhone 17).\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nAnother unknown is whether this is going to apply to every AirPods model, or only the most recent ones.

However, he was far from the only outgoing \"Postie\" being celebrated. \"But it was literally one caking after another,\" Kessler said. \"I mean, as we walked in for my event, they were packing up the leftover cake from the previous event. And as my wife remarked, as we walked through the newsroom to the place where they were holding my event, there was literally every conference room was filled with a caking, with people celebrating people who were leaving. So it was a very strange sugar high one got on your last day.\" LONGTIME WASHINGTON POST FACT CHECKER TAKES BUYOUT, SAYS PAPER HAS YET TO FIND REPLACEMENT BEFORE EXIT Kessler let out a belly laugh at the idea that The Post was giving so much business to one lucky bakery in Washington, D.C., as he speculated all the cakes were coming from the same bakery, though he didn't know which one. \"But the caking is such a newspaper cliché,\" Kessler said. \"I mean, one of my favorite movies is the movie ‘Spotlight,’ which is about The Boston Globe, and it opens with a caking. It was kind of like an inside journalism joke to open with a caking where people were eating this cake and they each have kind of awkward, strange, funny remarks that people make about the person that's leaving.\" \"So that was the last day. Caking, after caking, after caking, after caking,\" he added. The Washington Post had just concluded a round of buyouts, targeting the most senior staffers. The Post, which has struggled financially in recent years, has had multiple iterations of what it calls the Voluntary Separation Program (VSP). But as Kessler noted in his Substack piece shedding light on what led to his departure, this was going to be the \"last buyout,\" according to what a senior editor told him, and that any necessary staff reductions in the future would be layoffs. But not everyone who has left The Post in recent months was for a buyout. Many landed jobs at other news outlets while others resigned in protest over decisions made by the paper's billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos. Bezos sparked newsroom turmoil last October when he pulled The Post's forthcoming endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the presidential election. He fueled further consternation in February by launching a new mission for the editorial pages to promote \"personal liberties and free markets\" and vowing not to publish pieces opposing those principles. The Post has lost a significant portion of its biggest talent and high-profile journalists over the past year, Kessler being among them. However, some departures were more painful for the newsroom. WASHINGTON POST ABANDONS NEWSROOM INTEGRATION FOR ITS SOCIAL MEDIA-FOCUSED ‘WP VENTURES’ DIVISION Kessler cited a trio of top editors who announced their exits within a two-month span that took the biggest hit on newsroom morale; Matea Gold, The Post's managing editor who was poached by The New York Times to become its Washington editor, Philip Rucker, The Post's national editor who joined CNN as its senior vice president of editorial strategy and news, and Griff Witte, The Post's democracy editor who became The Atlantic's managing editor. Gold, in particular, Kessler noted, was the one who \"everyone thought should have been editor\" of The Post. \"Those three were the future leaders of The Washington Post,\" Kessler said. \"You could imagine any one of them running the newspaper at one point. And the fact that they all left? That was devastating.\" A spokesperson for The Washington Post declined to comment. Fox News' Annie McCuen contributed to this report.

Bob Rumson (played by Richard Dreyfuss).\n\n“I’ve known Bob Rumson for years,” the president says. “Bob’s problem isn’t that he doesn’t get it. Bob’s problem is that he can’t sell it!”\n\nThat is politics in a nutshell. Plenty of candidates have been better than the men who won the White House, but they simply couldn’t sell their message.\n\nEnter former Vice President Kamala Harris. She is exactly who President Shepherd is talking about. She has a message; she just can’t sell it. So she is doing what many victim-posing Democrats have done: bailing from politics and blaming the “system.”\n\n“Recently, I made the decision that I just – for now, I don’t want to go back in the system. I think it’s broken,” Ms. Harris said in her ninth appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” “I want to travel the country. I want to listen to people. I want to talk with people, and I don’t want it to be transactional, where I’m asking for their vote.”\n\nThat’s exactly what Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has spent the past 20 years doing: traveling the country (without spending a dime of his own money) as he perennially ran for president. And Ms. Harris has also announced that she won’t be running for governor of California in 2026.\n\nBut neither decision has anything to do with a “broken system”; both are based on the simple fact that Ms. Harris can’t sell her message. Never could, never will. Before President Joe Biden picked her as his running mate, Ms. Harris was polling at just 3% and dropped out of the race on Dec. 3, 2019, long before the first Americans had even cast their ballots in the Democratic primaries.\n\nIf this all sounds familiar, it’s because this is vintage Kamala Harris: word salads tossed with cryptic dressing and a main course of passion that somehow arrives undercooked. She said she’d focus on supporting Democrats (foreseeably a lot more fun when you’re not directly in the trenches yourself) while hinting at “future plans” that sound faintly presidential. But it’s early. She won’t run for president again.\n\nHer claim that the system is broken is purely a concocted story to cover the fact that Americans don’t like her — and neither do Democrats. According to veteran political journalist Mark Halperin, allies of Mr. Biden are prepared to leak “Palinesque” stories about Ms. Harris’ time as veep.\n\nWhat’s more, Ms. Harris also now faces a pretty glaring cold shoulder from fellow Democrats when it comes to her future political aspirations. After being handed Mr. Biden’s campaign in 2024 (following his spectacular fall from debate grace), she floundered her way to the dumpster, losing the Electoral College 312-226 to President Trump.\n\nDemocrats are done entertaining her aspirations for higher office. Ms. Harris’ political future now reads like a dry, awkward punchline, with insiders reportedly groaning at the mere mention of her running again. The party may have seen history made with her as the first female, Black and Asian vice president, but that honeymoon hardly lasted beyond the swearing-in ceremony.\n\n“Downballot candidates outperformed her in 2024, and she was a drag on them,” a national Democratic operative told Politico this week. “These candidates were able to win last year because they put distance between themselves and her and the national party. Why would we want to do that in 2026 when she’s not on the ballot?”\n\nOne last point: Why on Earth would Ms. Harris say all this on Mr. Colbert’s show? Just last month it was announced that his show would be ending in 2026, making him virtually irrelevant.\n\nMs. Harris isn’t known for her political savvy, but her repeated trips to a late-night circuit dwindling in influence make you wonder if her GPS is permanently set to “awkwardly redundant.”\n\nThere’s something delightfully cosmic about two symbols of diminishing returns coming together on one stage. We can forgive her handlers, though, because … what’s the alternative? When no one cares what you say, does it matter where you say it?\n\nIf you can find a betting site to make a wager on Ms. Harris never running for elective office again, bet the house. She’s done for good. But remember, it isn’t her fault: The system is “broken.”\n\n• Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.

Leave aside the very questionable theory that Hispanics in Texas (especially in the Rio Grande Valley) have been voting for Republicans rather than President Trump. Ignore whether it is a good idea to ask members of Congress to run in new districts in the middle of a cycle.\n\nLet’s instead focus on two very real pathologies associated with this sort of mid-cycle redistricting. First, once this particular genie is out of the bottle, everyone who can harvest extra seats through gerrymandering will do so, meaning the net result is that after wandering around for months, everyone winds up back where they started.\n\nThe second pathology is, of course, that these exercises further normalize gerrymandering, which has been around since the founding of the country and is today what it always has been: a mortal threat to representative government.\n\nWhen elected officials get to pick their voters, they have a solid preference for those already inclined to vote for them. The value and purpose of elections is minimized and the value of incumbency is maximized. Gerrymandering inevitably results in a system where adherence to partisan norms – rather than interest in representing voters – becomes the most important focus and goal of the elected official.\n\nRight now, 13 House Democrats represent districts Mr. Trump won in 2024, while three House Republicans represent districts carried by former Vice President Kamala Harris. As recently as 2000, there were 86 districts where voters voted for one party for president and a different one for their member of Congress.\n\nWhile split tickets and split districts make politics more challenging, they tend to make governing easier, as those elected in such districts need to find to ways to appeal to a broader constituency.\n\nIn short, gerrymandering complicates and retards the possibility of good governance.\n\nMore importantly, gerrymandering leads to anti-democratic results. Consider California. The California House delegation consists of 43 Democrats and nine Republicans. Gov. Gavin Newsom has indicated that he can reduce the number of Republicans in the delegation to just four, making the new split 48-4. In the most recent elections in California, about 60% of voters voted for Democratic candidates in House races, and about 40% voted for Republican candidates. If you just split the delegation along those lines, it would have about 38 Democrats and 21 Republicans.\n\nIn Illinois, the House delegation consists of 14 Democrats and three Republicans, despite the fact that in 2024, about 47% of Illinois voters voted for Republican House candidates. That delegation should be split nine Democrats and eight Republicans.\n\nIt is not just the Democrats. Missouri’s House delegation is 75% Republican. In 2024, 58% of Missouri voters voted for Republicans. If the proposed map in Texas is adopted, Republicans will hold about 80% of the House seats from Texas, despite only winning 58% of the vote. In Florida, about 70% of the House delegation is Republicans; again, only 58% of the voters voted for Republican House candidates in 2024.\n\nThe good news is that most of this darkness cancels itself out a national basis. In 2024, a shade less than 50% of the voters (49.7%) nationally voted for Republican House candidates, compared to about 47% of voters who voted for Democratic House candidates.\n\nA narrowly divided electorate gave us a narrowly divided House; that’s how it should be.\n\nThat should also lead everyone to a simple answer. Rather than allowing politicians to pick their voters (or worse yet, allowing “independent” commissions jammed with operatives to pick voters), we should simply require that states draw geographically coherent districts that result in delegations reflective of the partisan vote total in the state.\n\nOr we can keep having elections whose contours are decided by cartographers, judges and elected officials.\n\n• Michael McKenna is a contributing editor at The Washington Times.","summary":"Gerrymandering is destructive no matter who does it","url":"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/aug/6/gerrymandering-destructive-no-matter/","image":"https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/08/06/B1mcvkennaLGredistyricting.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-07 08:32:06","author":"Michael McKenna","authors":["Michael McKenna"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.171},{"id":348945442,"title":"Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan abandons GOP to join Democratic Party","text":"Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan announced he is leaving the GOP and joining the Democratic Party, a move he says has been a long time coming as he has bucked heads with the Republican Party. Duncan, who served as lieutenant governor as a Republican from 2019 until 2023, wrote in an op-ed in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Tuesday that his path to becoming a Democrat began before President Donald Trump attempted to overturn his loss to former President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, which Duncan criticized at the time. \"My journey to becoming a Democrat started well before Donald Trump tried to steal the 2020 election in Georgia,\" Duncan wrote in the newspaper. \"There’s no date on a calendar or line in the sand that points to the exact moment in time my political heart changed, but it has,\" he continued. \"My decision was centered around my daily struggle to love my neighbor, as a Republican.\" GEORGIA GOP EXPELS FORMER LT. GOV. GEOFF DUNCAN FROM PARTY, CITING ALLEGED DISLOYALTY Duncan pointed to several policy issues that played a part in his decision to change parties, criticizing Republicans for their handling of issues such as health care, Medicaid, gun safety, immigration and how to help poor people. He said his time in office taught him the best way to \"love my neighbor\" is through public policy. Before his time as lieutenant governor, he served in the Georgia House from 2013 until 2017. He opted not to run for re-election as lieutenant governor in 2022. The former Republican said GOP lawmakers have argued for decades that the solution to not having health insurance is to have a job, but noted that most uninsured people in the Peach State live in working households yet do not have insurance because of affordability or eligibility. \"So, the reality is they have a job, just the wrong job,\" Duncan wrote. \"One that doesn't offer health insurance or generate enough spare money each month to afford their own health insurance plan.\" REPUBLICAN DOOLEY JUMPS INTO GEORGIA'S SENATE RACE WHILE TOUTING SUPPORT FOR TRUMP AND TAKING AIM AT OSSOFF Duncan also said the Trump-backed spending bill that was signed into law last month will leave Medicaid funding \"in shambles,\" as it cuts hundreds of billions of dollars from the government program. He also criticized the measure for its cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as food stamps, and its impact on ensuring children do not go hungry at school. Duncan pointed to polls showing support for gun control measures such as universal background checks and red-flag laws. He also criticized the Trump administration's mass deportation immigration policies that he said \"have turned into a lesson on how not to love your neighbor.\" He said that immigration policy should focus on securing the border, deporting those in the country illegally who have committed felonies, but that a path to citizenship should be created for other migrants in the U.S. Duncan’s party switch comes after the Georgia Republican Party expelled him from the party earlier this year over alleged disloyalty. The party's resolution cited his endorsement of Biden in the 2024 presidential election and, once he dropped out, his endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as alleged efforts to undermine and sabotage some Republican candidates, including current Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and failed 2022 Senate candidate Herschel Walker. The former Republican also spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August in support of Harris.

While there is some degree of selective reporting in Briscoe’s numbers, there’s no doubt GB News did beat its rivals in several key slots in July. It’s both an impressive and terrifying gain for the broadcaster, which only launched four years ago but aims to be Britain’s biggest UK news channel by 2028.\n\nPresumably, rioting outside migrant hotels and talk about impending civil unrest is good for business. Online, GB News had an audience of ten million in June (around half that of Sky and a quarter of the BBC). One former Sky journalist has little doubt GB News will reach its 2028 target, saying: “When big stories break people still want the BBC and Sky, but the rest of the time there are a lot of viewers happy to sit and have their prejudices repeated back to them all day long.”\n\nYet still it is making losses: GB News, which is bankrolled by its owner, Paul Marshall, and the Dubai-based investment firm Legatum, lost $33.4m in 2023-24. Nigel Farage alone has earned £330,000 since July 2024. “The losses are now utterly irrelevant,” one former insider said. “Since Reform’s polling kicked off, it is felt every penny is money well spent.”\n\nAn end to wokery awaits The Yorkshire Shepherdess and Cruising with Jane McDonald because Channel 5 falls under the ownership of Skydance Media, as part of an $8bn mega-deal. The British broadcaster is owned by Paramount Global, which is to be taken over by the US billionaire David Ellison (recently spotted hanging out UFC ringside with Donald Trump). The deal was signed off by the US TV regulator after Ellison pledged to end all diversity, equity and inclusion programmes and Paramount shelled out $16m to settle a legal battle with Trump over the editing of the 60 Minutes Kamala Harris interview. There’s a rumoured side deal of $20m of free ads for Trump.\n\nFriends of the London-based Channel 5 boss, Sarah Rose, are worried about how she will cope under the new regime. Just months ago she wrote: “We are dedicated to creating an inclusive and equitable workplace,” and the channel has a “no diversity, no commission” pledge on its website. Staff are concerned the channel’s new owner might not just be looking for a culture change, but hoping to offload it entirely – or to ditch its £200m annual budget for original commissioning, in favour of a return to the dark old days under Richard Desmond when schedules were filled with reruns of US imports.\n\nITV has been busy ramping up excitement for The Hack, which tells how the Guardian journalist Nick Davies uncovered phone hacking at the News of the World in 2011. There are such high hopes that the drama will be the next Mr Bates vs the Post Office that Mr Bates (aka Toby Jones) appears as Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger. Also starring is Trainspotting’s Robert Carlyle, who leads the inquiry into the murder of the private investigator Daniel Morgan – a case that remains unsolved and which raised serious questions about corrupt relationships between Met detectives and newspaper staff. “Put it this way,” one former News of the World journo told me: “if you thought the Trainspotting toilet scene was about swimming in shit, that’s nothing compared with what went on in the Daniel Morgan case.”\n\nMentions on the BBC about the launch of Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana’s temporarily named Your Party have largely been of the blink-and-you’ll-miss-it variety. And yet the party already claims to have 650,000 sign ups – which rather casts shade on Reform UK’s (admittedly paying) membership, currently 231,721. Still, Reform is assured bountiful BBC coverage if Farage so much as sneezes. BBC journalists are keen to reset what has been a fractious relationship with Corbyn, but grumble that how little air time he is permitted lies in editors’ hands.\n\nFurther trouble for the broadcaster awaits,as yet more licence-fee money is being spent on another investigation by external lawyers. This time, tens of thousands are being earmarked to probe allegations that two Strictly Come Dancing stars were regularly taking cocaine while on the show. The investigation into the former newsreader Huw Edwards cost around £400,000 (plus another £1m for a review of complaints procedures) and £3.3m was spent investigating claims against DJ Tim Westwood. As one BBC journo put it: “I’ve decided the only way I’ll ever get a pay rise here is to retrain as an HR lawyer.”\n\nFarewell, then, to MailOnline, the home of the sidebar of shame and 40-word headlines. The site is now to be known simply as Daily Mail – a nod to its print history.

The Biden political campaign paid him $4 million for his work and he was set to receive another $4 million bonus when Biden was reelected.\n\nIt is no wonder Donilon wanted the frail Biden to stay in the campaign despite his disastrous debate performance that forced Biden to drop out of the race. To Donilon, Biden was a money machine.\n\nDonilon last week told a House panel investigating Biden’s mental fitness to govern, “I believed that President Biden was the best person to lead the country on the day he took office, and I continued to believe that was true every day he served as president.”\n\nNobody may believe him, but at least he did not, like other Biden staffers, refuse to answer House committee questions, or peddle a book.\n\nIf released as a trilogy, each book would have a separate title and market strategy as fits the author, but the umbrella title of the set could be, in a bow to Fyodor Dostoevsky, “Crime and Punishment.”\n\nHowever, others have suggested the title should be “Con and Embellishment.\n\nBiden’s book about his four years as president is still a work in progress. It will be completed in the fall if, given his age and iffy memory, he doesn’t forget to write it.\n\nWhile no publication date has been set, one tentative title for his book is “Stories My Staff Told Me.”\n\nWhile Biden got $10 million for the book from the Hachette Book Group, it is $5 million less than what Bill Clinton got for his, and a whopping $50 million less than what Barack and Michelle Obama got from Penguin Random House for their books.\n\nIt is hoped that Biden’s book will not clash with the one written by Harris, his vice president who, of course, replaced Biden as the 2024 Democratic Party candidate for president and who was badly beaten by Trump.\n\nHer “behind the scenes” memoir of the campaign, being published in September by Simon & Schuster, is called “107 Days,” which sounds more like a prison sentence than a book.\n\nGiven that she went through more than $1 billion running for president, or more than $10 million a day, and lost ground each day, a more appropriate title would be “107 Nightmares.”\n\nAt the rate she burned though money she could have paid Donilon a dozen times over to tell her how great he was doing.\n\nThe third book in the trilogy may be the best of all. It is the one written by former Biden White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, which will be out in October.\n\nA veteran Democrat Party campaigner, Jean-Pierre said she left the party and became an Independent after the party’s “betrayal” of Joe Biden\n\nWhile her book is called “Independent. A Look Inside a Broken White House Outside the Party Lines,” a better title would be “Cover-up: How I Conned the Press.”\n\nOr “Cover-up: How the Press Helped Me Con the Public.”\n\nAlmost to the last day on the job, and her last White House press briefing, KJP defended Biden’s mental fitness when everyone else could see he was in trouble.\n\nAnd the media went along with her coverup, despite Biden’s obvious faltering. “I would put the president’s stamina up against anyone,” she said to critics.\n\n“The proof is in the pudding,” she said. And so it was, only the pudding was in Biden’s head.\n\nVeteran political reporter Peter Lucas can be reached at: peter.lucas@bostonherald.com","summary":"The three forthcoming books are Joe Biden’s memoir about his four years as president, Kamala Harris’ book about her failed campaign for president, and the third by Karine Jean-Pierre, Biden’s press secretary.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/08/07/lucas-biden-co-making-bank-on-book-deals/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP24278688218269.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-07 07:11:26","author":"Peter Lucas","authors":["Peter Lucas"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.337},{"id":348877436,"title":"Trump claims Howard Stern’s SiriusXM show ‘went down’ after the shock jock endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016","text":"President Trump claimed Howard Stern’s longtime SiriusXM show “went down” because the legendary radio host endorsed Hillary Clinton before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump was fielding questions from reporters inside the Oval Office when he was briefed on the reported uncertainty surrounding the 71-year-old and his titular show.\n\n“Howard Stern is a name I haven’t heard – I used to do his show, we used to have fun – but I haven’t heard that name in a long time,” Trump said Wednesday in the White House.\n\n“What happened?

I think our show clearly comes from a point of view, but most of those long stories we do are not party political.”\n\n “They’re about systemic issues,” the former Daily Show correspondent continued. “Our last few shows were about gang databases, AI slop, juvenile justice, med spas, air traffic control. I’m not saying that these don’t have a point of view in them. Of course they do. But I hope a lot of them actually reach across people’s political persuasions. You want people to at least be able to agree on the problem, even if you disagree on what the solution to it is.”\n\n On July 27, Leno, 75, said at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute that although he loves political humor, he tried not to turn off half his audience during his years as The Tonight Show’s host.\n\n “Why shoot for half an audience? Why not try to get the whole? I like to bring people into the big picture. I don’t understand why you would alienate one particular group,” Leno said. “Or just don’t do it at all. I’m not saying you have to throw your support or whatever, but just do what’s funny.”\n\n Leno went on to say that he enjoyed getting hate mail from both Republican and Democratic viewers because that meant he got a “whole” audience. “[Nowadays], you have to be content with half the audience because you have to give your opinion,” he said.\n\n The very future of late-night television came under a microscope on July 17, when CBS surprisingly canceled Stephen Colbert’s show, despite its popularity. The timing led to speculation that the decision was tied to politics, as CBS’ parent company, Paramount, sought approval from the Trump administration for its merger with entertainment company Skydance. The FCC approved the merger on July 25.\n\n Earlier in July, CBS also reached a $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump. The president sued CBS News, accusing 60 Minutes of deceptively editing an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential campaign. \n\n In a statement, CBS said that the Late Show’s cancellation was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night” and “not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”\n\n Since Colbert’s firing, his colleagues have shown their support. Oliver joined Jon Stewart, Jimmy Fallon, Andy Cohen and Anderson Cooper on the July 21 Late Night episode. Jimmy Kimmel has also shown his support on social media.\n\n “Well, we’ve been in contact as a group since the strike… so as soon as the news broke, we were all checking in with Stephen in that chat and then he came up with the idea and asked us to come, and of course we’re all going to do it,” Oliver told THR. “You want to be able to support him and his staff in a horrible, horrible time.”","summary":"\"Comedy can't be for everyone.

During an appearance on “Jesse Watters: Primetime,” Gingrich discussed the political realignment taking place, where Republican figures are gaining traction with blue-collar workers and traditionally union-aligned voters like the Teamsters.\n\n“I mean, maybe you go back to Franklin Roosevelt in ‘33, ‘34, ‘35, when the Republicans were literally collapsing,” Gingrich said. “They went from being the dominant party for over 60 years to a tiny minority. You’re seeing that happen now.”\n\nGingrich said Republicans are benefiting daily from the left’s growing embrace of radical figures.\n\n“I thought when the senator from Massachusetts went down to endorse Mamdani as the future of the Democratic Party. If you’re a Republican I mean this is like Christmas every single day,” Gingrich added. “There’s another gift that comes in over the transom. And you just can’t imagine these people are so out of touch with everyday normal Americans that it’s, I think it’s astonishing.”\n\nTeamsters President Sean O’Brien said Tuesday that the Democrats are abandoning working Americans in favor of special interests and progressive causes. He noted that nearly 60% of union members preferred Trump over Harris, and faulted Democrats for failing to engage voters face-to-face.

The body is barely breathing.\n\nYes, “The Howard Stern Show” on SiriusXM is reportedly limping toward its final destination. The former shock jock’s $500 million contract, which he signed in 2020, is up in the fall; according to the US Sun, there’s a good chance he’ll be offered less money than he wants to renew.\n\nWhile there’s no official confirmation the show will end, it should go the way of Stephen Colbert’s farce of a late-night show.\n\nThis isn’t dancing on the grave of someone’s career. It’s merely acknowledging reality: Stern, 71, was paid all that ‘scarole to be edgy, relevant and interesting — something he hasn’t been in years.\n\nCertainly not since he enlisted in the cult of woo-woo therapization and disavowed so much of his best work, including pulling bawdy confessions from image-conscious bold-facers.\n\nNo more jokes about masturbating to Aunt Jemima. No more feuds with celebs like Chevy Chase and Kathie Lee Gifford. No more release-valve humor during some of our country’s darkest events. Or the inclination to be raw and unfiltered.\n\nOnce a swashbuckling, norms-shattering FCC antagonist, Stern has morphed into everything he formerly railed against.\n\nWhen it comes to celebrities, he can’t fawn over them enough now. Stern’s a first-class, A-list “Ass Smoochio,” a nickname he gave Arsenio Hall back in the day.\n\nLast summer, Stern — overestimating his own influence — made things even worse by entering the presidential media circus to sit down with a clearly diminished Joe Biden.\n\nThe old Stern would have spent 30 minutes at least on the gaffe-prone president’s mythical neighborhood gang leader and overall “bad dude” Corn Pop.\n\nInstead, he marveled over Scranton Joe’s high-school football exploits. He called Biden’s family — which consists of a crackhead son he later pardoned and a grandchild he didn’t acknowledge until the New York Times bullied him into it — “extraordinary.”\n\nStern even offered this profundity: “You’re the kind of leader I love … we’re lucky to have you in the Oval Office.”\n\nFartman would never.\n\nNot only did the fawning interview make Biden look like a doddering old man, it made Stern look positively impotent.\n\nStern sank even lower when he interviewed Biden’s replacement, Kamala Harris.\n\n“When I met you out in the hall, I said, ‘I’m really nervous because I want this to go well for you,’” Stern said. He then whined about “Saturday Night Live” parodying Harris.\n\n“I hate it. I don’t want you being made fun of,” Stern told her. “There’s too much at stake. I believe the entire future of this country right now … it’s literally on the line.”\n\nImagine that. A man who built an empire off of mocking powerful people thought that the potential president of the United States shouldn’t have to suffer a few jokes at her expense — something that actually works to humanize a candidate.\n\nTo call it malpractice would be kind.\n\nMeanwhile, Stern’s loyal audience, who dutifully renewed their Sirius subscriptions, are fair game for his wrath.\n\nLocking himself away in a two-year Covid quarantine, he derided listeners for daring to go outside and live their lives, calling them “stupid” for not sharing his ideology.\n\n“I hate the people who vote for [Trump],” he said last September. “I think they’re stupid. I do. I’ll be honest with you, I have no respect for you.”\n\nSiriusXM essentially built its initial subscriber base on the back of the one-time “King of all Media,” who in 2006 left terrestrial radio and the constraints of the FCC. That deal was reportedly worth $100 million a year and made him a very wealthy man.\n\nNearly 20 years on, the once-mighty monarch looks like a minor jester.\n\nMeanwhile, the media and entertainment landscape has been radically reshaped by an over-abundance of podcasts. There are a gazillion hosts doing what Stern once did — and many doing it much better.\n\nIt’s time for the retirement tour.","summary":"While there's no official confirmation the show will end, it should go the way of Stephen Colbert's farce of a late-night show.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/06/opinion/howard-sterns-show-may-be-ending-put-it-out-of-its-misery/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/newspress-collage-9twj0g52t-1754523128565.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1754508848&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/gWSIxBaN-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-06 23:40:05","author":"Kirsten Fleming","authors":["Kirsten Fleming"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.209},{"id":348818284,"title":"Trump reveals his bizarre theory on why Howard Stern could be cancelled","text":"President Donald Trump gave his take on why longtime radio show host Howard Stern may be facing cancellation. \n\nThe Sun reported Wednesday that Stern's SiriusXM show will end after the shock jock's current contract is up. \n\nThe Daily Mail previously reported that Stern had been in 'very serious negotiations' with SiriusXM about whether he would be able to extend his $500 million contract, which ends at the end of the year.\n\n'Howard Stern is a name I haven't heard - I used to do his show, we used to have fun - but I haven't heard that name in a long time,' Trump told reporters Wednesday in the Oval Office.

Trump then said. 'When he endorsed Hillary Clinton, he lost his audience. People said, get me a break. He went down when he endorsed Hillary Clinton.' \n\nClinton was Trump's 2016 opponent. \n\nStern also had Trump's 2024 rival, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, on his show last year. \n\nTrump also continued to chime in on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert's cancellation. \n\nColbert and the Late Show will both end in May. \n\n'Colbert has no talent,' Trump said in the Oval on Wednesday.\n\n'I mean, I could take anybody here.

That's one I wouldn't have known, but I'm glad you told me that,' he continued.\n\n'If Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think her ad is fantastic.'\n\nSince then, he posted on Truth Social sharing his support for the actress - and the White House's social media account created a meme of Trump, shouting out from the West Wing's rooftop, which he visited Wednesday.\n\n'Have you seen the Sydney Sweeney ad?' the post said.","summary":"President Donald Trump gave his take on why longtime radio show host Howard Stern may be facing cancellation.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14977661/donald-trump-howard-stern-cancellation-hillary-clinton.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/06/23/100989021-0-image-a-11_1754519874690.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 22:53:03","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.316},{"id":348829598,"title":"Elon Musk wins California free speech court ruling on digitally altered videos","text":"Tech mogul Elon Musk notched an important victory for free speech this week after a federal judge on Tuesday invalidated a California law that sought to restrict digitally altered videos on online platforms like X, which Musk owns.\n\nAssembly Bill 2655, the Defending Democracy from Deepfake Deception Act of 2024, required X and some other large platforms to “block the posting of materially deceptive content related to elections in California, during specified periods before and after an election.”\n\n“No parts of this statute are severable because the whole statute is preempted,” U.S. District Court Judge John Mendez explained in his ruling. “No parts of A.B. 2655 can be salvaged,” he added.\n\nMendez, a 2008 appointee of President George W. Bush, found that the legislation was not compatible with Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and declined to rule on the free speech merits of the case. The federal judge, on the district court for the Eastern District of California, found that platforms like X “don’t have anything to do with these videos that the state is objecting to. ”\n\nThe lawsuit against the California legislation was originally brought by Christopher Kohls, who had created a digitally altered parody video in 2024 in which then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris calls herself the “ultimate diversity hire.” Musk’s social media platform X, the satire website the Babylon Bee, and the online video platform Rumble later joined Kohls’ lawsuit.\n\nThe legislation was signed into state law by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, in September of last year and was designed to take effect before the 2024 presidential election in an attempt to stop the sharing of artificial intelligence-generated, altered videos known as deepfakes that parodied political candidates including Harris, who then was still vice president.\n\nNewsom discussed his thinking behind passing legislation restricting digitally altered videos in July 2024 writing that “Manipulating a voice in an ‘ad’ like this one should be illegal,” in response to a news article about Musk sharing the altered Harris campaign advertisement. “I’ll be signing a bill in a matter of weeks to make sure it is,” the California governor added.\n\nMusk did not take the criticism lightly, replying on X below the governor’s comments, “I checked with renowned world authority, Professor Suggon Deeznutz, and he said parody is legal in America.”\n\nAbout a year later, the Tesla CEO appears at least partially vindicated.\n\nA spokeswoman for Newsom told The Daily Signal, “We are still reviewing the Court’s ruling, but remain convinced that common sense labeling requirements for deepfakes are important to maintain the integrity of our elections.”\n\nMendez also said he will overrule another California law restricting AI-generated content in the near future. That legislation according to its author, Assemblywoman Gail Pellerin, allowed recipients of digitally altered material to seek injunctive relief and damages from the distributor of the material, and it additionally mandated that deepfake parody material be marked that it was digitally altered.\n\n[Editor’s note: This story originally was published by The Daily Signal.]","summary":"Democrats struck down constitutional rights after parody mocked Kamala Harris as 'ultimate diversity hire'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/08/elon-musk-wins-california-free-speech-court-ruling/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/elon-musk-deparrtment-of-energy-efficiency.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 22:32:44","author":"The Daily Signal","authors":["The Daily Signal"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":348848518,"title":"Laura Loomer testified that Bill Maher’s joke about her sleeping with Trump torpedoed her chance at White House job","text":"MAGA extremist Laura Loomer recently testified in her $150 million defamation lawsuit against Bill Maher that the HBO star’s joke about her sleeping with Donald Trump ended up costing her a position at the White House because of the “media frenzy” it created.\n\nLoomer, the self-annointed Trump “loyalty” enforcer whose influence with the president has seemingly risen in recent months, sat down for a deposition last week with HBO’s attorney. And, as Puck reported, it quickly became “every bit as unhinged as one might expect.”\n\nThe lawsuit, which Loomer filed in October of last year, centers on a September 2024 episode of Real Time where the comic suggested that Loomer’s sudden ascendance in Trump’s orbit was due to the two of them engaging in a sexual liaison.\n\n“I think maybe Laura Loomer’s in an arranged relationship to affect the election because she’s very close to Trump. She’s 31, looks like his type,” Maher quipped. “We did an editorial here a few years ago… it was basically, who’s Trump f***ing? Because I said, you know, it’s not nobody. He’s been a dog for too long, and it’s not Melania. I think we may have our answer this week. I think it might be Laura Loomer.”\n\nIn her complaint, Loomer alleges that she was subjected to “unjustified ridicule, embarrassment, loss of reputation and professional opportunity, as well as being damaged financially” by the joke, adding that the comments were “false, malicious and defamatory.” She also claimed that Maher denied her request for a public apology and an invitation on his show to “mitigate prior and any further damage.”\n\nMaher’s joke, meanwhile, came days after Loomer accompanied the then-candidate to a presidential debate and events commemorating the 9/11 attacks, prompting concerns from advisers and allies about her unofficial campaign role. During the final days of the campaign, he would publicly distance himself from her, all while promising his aides that he’d stop regularly inviting her on his flights.\n\nDuring her deposition, which was briefly on the public docket last week before being sealed by Magistrate Judge Philip Lammens, Loomer looked to make the case that she would currently be working in the White House if it weren’t for Maher.\n\nThroughout the questioning from attorney Kate Bolger, Loomer boasted about her increasing clout with the president, stating that he first became impressed with her adversarial “reporting” on GOP presidential rival Ron DeSantis in 2023. \n\nLoomer noted that she would soon be invited to Mar-a-Lago and that Trump told Susie Wiles, his current White House chief of staff, to immediately hire her. Instead, Loomer stated, that didn’t happen because the news was leaked to the New York Times, which reported that her hiring “would cause a backlash, given her history of inflammatory statements and her embrace of the Republican Party’s fringes.” The Times later appended the story to point out its reporting had “ignited a firestorm” among the MAGA base and resulted in Trump backing off.\n\nStill, according to Loomer, she continued to enjoy access in Trumpworld and estimated that she’d visited Mar-a-Lago at least “20,30 times,” flew around with Trump, and submitted a resume for an administration job. She also recalled that on the flight to Trump’s debate with Kamala Harris in Philadelphia, she showed him what she said was a police report after he asked if the rumors about Haitian immigrants in Ohio were real, leading to the infamous “eating dogs” moment.\n\nBolger, meanwhile, pressed Loomer on why she was so certain it was Maher’s joke – which came days after the debate – that doomed her job prospects with the president.\n\n“Other than Bill Maher, can you name a single human being on all of Planet Earth that believes what Bill Maher said?” Bolger asked, prompting Loomer to respond: “It’s up for interpretation.”\n\nLoomer went on to say that Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita would later tell her she wasn’t welcome back on Trump’s plane because of the “media frenzy” the HBO host’s joke had sparked. \n\nElsewhere in the deposition, Bolger brought up the lengthy history of inflammatory commentary from Loomer, a self-described “proud Islamophobe” who has made numerous accusations about the personal lives of other prominent political figures. This could have potentially been an effort to establish that Maher’s one-off line about Loomer wouldn’t have done any meaningful reputational damage to the far-right provocateur.\n\nThat did lead Loomer to bring up her ongoing feud with fellow MAGA firebrand Marjorie Taylor Greene, whom Loomer accused of being “very jealous of me” and not well-liked by Trump’s staff.\n\nNaturally, a sitdown with Loomer wouldn’t be complete without a nasty swipe, which Bolger received when the plaintiff took aim at her past representation of Disney in the ABC News lawsuit that was settled with Trump. “I’m not going to be gaslit by a Democratic lawyer who represents fake news media,” Loomer fumed.\n\nWhile Loomer may not have a White House job, and the six-figure salary that comes with it, she has been patting herself on the back lately over the amount of influence she supposedly wields with the president.\n\nClaiming to have played an outsized role in the abrupt firings of more than a dozen high-ranking administration officials over what she says is insufficient loyalty to the president, who she has repeatedly declared her “love” for, Loomer recently joked that one of her friends now calls her “Trump’s Rasputin.”","summary":"Laura Loomer claimed that the Trump campaign told her that the joke caused a ‘media frenzy’ and she was no longer welcome on the campaign plane","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/bill-maher-laura-loomer-trump-lawsuit-b2803305.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/12/04/14/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/G6e5rEBq-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-06 21:54:36","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.458},{"id":348822156,"title":"Soros-Backed Group, Beto O’Rourke PAC Pick Up Tab For Texas Democrats’ Gerrymandering Stunt","text":"Groups tied to billionaire megadonor George Soros and failed candidate Beto O’Rourke are picking up the tab for Texas Democrats who fled the state to block a GOP redistricting plan, according to The Texas Tribune.\n\nSince Sunday, dozens of Texas House Democrats have taken refuge in blue states such as Illinois to deny the state House a quorum needed to pass a new congressional map that could net Republicans up to five additional seats. The absent democrats face a $500 fine for each day they are absent, but O’Rourke’s Powered by People PAC and the Soros-backed Texas Majority PAC are covering much of the cost, according to The Texas Tribune.\n\nSince the Texas House Democrats fled the Lone Star State, Powered by People has directed all donations towards supporting the effort, according to the Texas Tribune. O’Rourke’s political outfit has reportedly paid for lawmakers’ expenses, including travel, including private flights, hotel rooms, meals and logistical support, a source familiar with the matter told the outlet. (RELATED: Liberal Media Dutifully Ignoring Illinois’ Blatant Gerrymandering Hypocrisy)\n\nO’Rourke personally called lawmakers in recent weeks, urging them to flee the state to block the GOP redistricting efforts, The Texas Tribune reported.\n\nMeanwhile, the Texas Majority PAC is reportedly coordinating with national Democratic groups to court the party’s biggest donors to fund the lawmakers’ ongoing absence. The PAC is bankrolled by Soros and was founded by alumni of O’Rourke’s failed 2022 gubernatorial campaign.\n\nTexas Majority spent over $9 million during the 2024 election cycle, with nearly two-thirds coming from Soros, according to the Texas Tribune. Despite significant spending in the state, former Vice President Kamala Harris lost Texas to President Donald Trump by nearly 14 points in 2024, and Sen. Ted Cruz defeated Democratic Rep. Colin Allred by 8.5 points.\n\nMost of the Texas Democrats are hunkering down in the heavily-gerrymandered state of Illinois, protected by billionaire Democrat Gov. J.B. Pritzker. The governor said on Tuesday that he has not yet financially supported the Democrats, but is “not reticent to do that.”\n\nOn Sunday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott warned in a letter sent to the absent Democrats that fundraising to cover fines associated with their absence could be a violation of Texas House rules and bribery laws. Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton followed up on Wednesday by launching an investigation into Powered by People for “potentially operating an illegal financial influence scheme to bribe runaway Democrats.”\n\n“Any Democrat coward breaking the law by taking a Beto Bribe will be held accountable,” said Paxton. “Texas cannot be bought. I look forward to thoroughly reviewing all of the documents and communications obtained throughout this investigation. These jet-setting runaways have already lost public trust by abandoning our state, and Texans deserve to know if they received illegal bribes to do it.”\n\nO’Rourke told The Texas Tribune that he would “have the backs of these heroic state lawmakers for as long as it takes to stop Trump’s power grab.”\n\n“Every dime of expense for this effort is being paid for lawfully,” a spokesperson for the Texas House Democratic Caucus told The Texas Tribune, but declined to provide further details.\n\nThis is not the first time Powered by People has backed a similar effort, according to The Texas Tribune. In 2021, the group reportedly raised $600,000 to help fund Texas Democrats’ trip to Washington, D.C., as part of an effort to block Republican-backed election integrity measures.\n\nNeither Powered by People nor Texas Majority responded to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment. \n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.
