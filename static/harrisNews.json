(One of these “educational” facilities even misspelled “learning” on its signage.)\n\nShirley’s massively viral video — with 116 million views and counting — inspired others to dig into political donation records.\n\nSure enough, recipients of the daycare funding were making big donations to, you guessed it, Democratic politicians. \n\nFirst to come under scrutiny is Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who represents the district where many of the scams — which may have siphoned off a staggering $9 billion — are centered.\n\nOmar’s venture-capitalist husband is quietly scrubbing his website of key officer details as questions grow over how the congresswoman suddenly acquired a $30 million fortune.\n\nNow Gov. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’ bumbling 2024 running mate, is starting to get some tough questions. \n\nJohn Hinderaker, whose Minnesota-based Center for the American Experiment think tank has been on top of this fraud story for years, explains this scandal isn’t exactly new. \n\nA decade ago the FBI investigated Somali child-care fraudsters for opening daycare centers with no kids and collecting state money for fictitious children. \n\n“A number of Somalis went to prison, but it didn’t deter others from carrying out similar frauds, on a grander scale,” Hinderaker wrote on his PowerLine blog.\n\nWalz, who was in Congress when the last batch of Somali scam artists faced charges, can’t be ignorant of this history.\n\nDoes this mean Tim Walz is going to jail? Unlikely. \n\n“Did Tim Walz know the frauds were going on?” Hinderaker asks. “Of course. Even Walz isn’t that stupid.\n\n“But absent taking bribes, of which there is zero evidence, he has not committed a crime.” \n\nProbably correct.\n\nThe FBI is surging investigators to Minnesota in search of more fraud — and director Kash Patel says what we’ve seen so far just the “tip of a very large iceberg.”\n\nPerhaps high-level officials will someday face charges.\n\nBut until then, this scandal leaves additional questions to be addressed. \n\nFirst, with Walz on the Democratic presidential ticket in 2024, why did no national or local “mainstream” journalists look into all this? \n\nGiven the previous prosecutions, the background of a state’s governor on a national ticket should be a top priority for any honest press.\n\n(I know, haha, I said “honest press.”)\n\nEven now, Minnesota press isn’t covering this story. \n\nShirley’s findings went uber-viral on social media — but the Minnesota Star-Tribune and St. Paul Pioneer Press have said not a word about his post as I write. \n\nWell, like much of the national media, these papers have long had a hand-in-glove relationship with the state’s Democrats. \n\nAnd as humorist Jim Treacher puts it, they see their job as determining what stories the public doesn’t need to know about, because they might hurt the Democratic Party. \n\nThe other question, of course, is whether this scandal extends to other states, too.\n\nAnd the answer is, almost certainly. \n\nWhere money floats around without adequate safeguards, fraud is almost inevitable — and many federal and state programs seem almost deliberately designed to facilitate fraud. \n\nI added that “almost” purely out of courtesy. \n\nThis month a whistleblower in Maine alleged that the state’s Medicaid program was bilked out of millions by another Somali scammer.\n\nAnd California’s nonpartisan state auditor recently issued a report on “high risk” state programs that found billions lost to wrongful food-assistance and other welfare claims. \n\nThe extent of the loss is staggering, even to cynics like me. \n\nBut what do we do?\n\nWe could try to find more honest public officials. (Haha, I said “honest public officials”).\n\nExtensive arrests and prosecutions — not only of the scammers, but of the bureaucrats who turned a blind eye — won’t magically make our officials honest, but it might make them think twice. \n\nAnd we could simply turn off the cash spigot by cutting welfare programs way back. \n\nIf we leave more money in taxpayers’ pockets, it’ll be harder for public officials to steal it.\n\nI know, crazy talk. \n\nAnd yet — it would work.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds is a professor of law at the University of Tennessee and founder of the InstaPundit.com blog.","summary":"Where money floats around without adequate safeguards, fraud is almost inevitable — and many programs seem almost deliberately designed to facilitate scams. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/29/opinion/minnesotas-somali-scams-get-worse-by-the-day-who-will-pay/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/2025-washington-dc-committee-held-117980011-e1767052038471.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 23:47:43","author":"Glenn H.

But I would slip inside the skin of our president.\"\n\n As for why he'd want to embody the 79-year-old president — with whom he's frequently sparred — Colbert had a brief and decisive explanation, saying that if he could be Trump, \"I would resign.\"\n\n “I've anticipated this. No scandal, no confession, no Sturm und Drang,\" Colbert continued. \"Just go, ‘It’s been great. I’m the best, ever. I’m gonna go out on top. I’ve done everything. I’m just gonna go.’ That’s it. It can be a glorious ending, just end it.”\n\n After a moment of consideration, Colbert then wondered if the Freaky Friday-esque experiment would go both ways.\n\n “I have a harrowing follow-up question: Is he taking over my body for 24 hours?” Colbert quipped, joking that he'd tell his wife, “Darling, go see your sister for a while.”\n\n Colbert's remarks are the latest in his ongoing feud with the president, who recently slammed Colbert via Truth Social as a \"pathetic trainwreck with no talent or anything else necessary for show business success.\"\n\n “Now, after being terminated by CBS, but left out to dry, he has actually gotten worse, along with his nonexistent ratings,\" Trump added. \"Stephen is running on hatred and fumes ~ A dead man walking! CBS should, ‘put him to sleep,’ NOW, it is the humanitarian thing to do!”\n\n Trump has been outspoken about his opinion on Colbert in recent months, particularly since the comedian announced in July that his show would be ending in May 2026 after 10 seasons.\n\n News of Colbert's show ending came days after he blasted Paramount, the parent company of CBS, for its July 3 settlement with President Donald Trump for $16 million following a legal battle in which he accused journalists at 60 Minutes of deceptively editing a 2024 interview with his presidential election opponent, Kamala Harris.\n\n Along with his revelation of wanting to switch places with Trump, Colbert also shared during Political Gabfest whether he'd consider running for president in 2028.\n\n \"Absolutely, I should not run for president,\" he said of the frequently asked question from his fans.\n\n \"I understand why you'd want me to,\" he told the audience, before channeling his inner politician: \"I'd have to discuss with my faith leader and my family to see if, once my service on The Late Show ends in May, if I could be of some greater service to this nation that I love so much.\"","summary":"The late-night host did, however, express concern about what Trump might try to do as Colbert if they switched bodies in the hypothetical scenario","url":"https://people.com/stephen-colbert-switch-bodies-donald-trump-11876960","image":"https://people.com/thmb/DpVXd6MAXgwoERRVYUEjAZI8l0o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Stephen-Colbert-Donald-Trump-122925-ab840b8aa54441bbbfaac11cd0604598.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 21:13:17","author":"Charmaine Patterson","authors":["Charmaine Patterson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.088},{"id":389945278,"title":"Mayor Pete's secret... Kamala's revenge plot... and Gavin's hidden family weakness: MARK HALPERIN ranks eight Democrats in the running for the White House","text":"The ball hasn't dropped on 2025 but there's already buzz in the air over 2028.\n\nThe unofficial race for the White House has begun even if the candidates won't admit it and their press secretaries would sooner swallow a microphone than confirm anything.\n\nI am picking up an unmistakable energy among the whispering political class. Fundraisers are filling their calendars, donors are getting restless and eager office-seekers are gaming out where they'll work the rope lines for the 2026 midterms in March.\n\nFor Republicans, they're fieldling a small team this year, as President Donald Trump continues to suck up the oxygen in Washington, leaving tiny gulps of air for rumored aspirants like Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and even Texas Senator Ted Cruz.\n\nOn the other hand, the Democratic side is generating a whole heap of speculation. And, while most voters are blissfully ignoring it all, I and others have begun handicapping the field. \n\nThough before I reveal my top eight picks for who will win the Democratic nomination for president in 2028, a few necessary caveats…\n\nOne, it's still early. No one knows what the primary election calendar will look like. The Democratic National Committee hasn't even received applications from the state parties (due in January) as they jockey to maximize their influence on the contest. As former President Joe Biden proved in South Carolina in 2020, a well-positioned primary victory can change everything. Order matters, but so does momentum and timing.\n\nTwo, some major figures will most assuredly end up not running. Right now, the party's vigor is on the progressive wing, but the mood of the electorate seems to change hourly.\n\nNow, without further ado, the eight most likely – as of this moment – Democratic nominees for president in 2028, ranked least likely to most likely.\n\n#8: Bronx Brawler\n\nSome say New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the most likely to win the nomination, others wouldn't rank her at all. But if the base of the party decides it wants a torch-wielding outsider, she becomes instantly formidable.\n\nHer strength is the unmatched grassroots energy she generates. Nobody else on this list can summon a movement the way she can.\n\nHer secret strength is that behind the scenes, she's built more bridges within the party than people assume, reaching out to more moderate members of her own party and even to a few Republicans.\n\nHer weaknesses? Skepticism from centrists, limited experience that comes with relatively young age, 36, and concerns over her seriousness. Running for president means sacrificing on nearly everything else. Insiders question if she's ready for that.\n\n#7: Chicago Style\n\nIf Democrats decide they want a billionaire after all—and stranger things have happened — Illinois governor JB Pritzker is waiting in the wings.\n\nHis greatest strength goes together with his most obvious weakness. With an estimated net worth of $3.7 billion from an inherited Hyatt Hotels fortune, he can self-fund, but many Democrats aren't eager to nominate someone who can buy their own campaign.\n\nHis secret strength is that he's deeply connected to Democratic interest groups, especially labor unions – and wears his working-class sympathies on his sleeve, advocating for minimum wage hikes and forgiving medical debt.\n\n#6: Tinseltown's man\n\nWes Moore is the charismatic governor of Maryland. Hollywood loves him — George Clooney is already aboard — and many Democratic donors and strategists do too. He's got that 'It Factor', a seemingly stellar résumé and the ability to dazzle donors and voters alike.\n\nSecret advantage: This US Army combat veteran is not just charming on camera; he's personally magnetic in the rooms and salons of the Democratic elite, which is where nomination fights are often meaningfully advanced.\n\nHis weakness is that he hasn't been in national politics long – and his accomplishments in public life can be listed on the back of a napkin. If the hype ever races ahead of the record or his glittering bio turns out to be less than all that, the backlash could be intense.\n\n#5: Southern Snoozer\n\nDemocrats dream of a candidate who can appeal to red-state voters and mild-mannered Governor of Kentucky Andy Beshear fits the mold. Some insiders nearly demanded that I place him higher. Still, others don't believe he belongs on the list at all.\n\nHis strength is that he looks like a president out of central casting and – believe it or not – that matters enormously in identity-oriented Democratic circles right now. His appeal appears to come from a steady calm persona — never rattled, never theatrical, reassuring to jittery party elders who crave stability.\n\nBut he's not exactly electric on stage. And, fair or not, Kentucky politics is not the big time. Some wonder whether he has the grits to withstand the brutality of a modern presidential campaign.\n\n#4: She's Baaaack!\n\nI didn't place Kamala Harris in my top eight just a few weeks ago, but she has begun to lean more openly into the notion that she's considering a run, with those close to her making it clear her recent interviews and book tour stop announcements are meant to send the signal that she should not be overlooked by the Great Speculators.\n\nHer known strengths are enormous: a national profile, deep relationships with core Democratic constituencies and the historic weight of being a former vice president. A lesser-known strength: privately, she is far looser, funnier, and more natural than the cautious politician Americans see on television. If she showed that version more often, some of her critics might soften.\n\nHer weaknesses are familiar: inconsistent execution, difficulty making crisp decisions under pressure, and skepticism from donors and strategists who simply don't believe she can win. That's a heavy headwind.\n\n#3: Mr Mayor\n\nPete Buttigieg is a prodigy of modern Democratic politics. He came on stronger as the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who can speak six foreign languages and won a top stop as Biden's Transportation Secretary. But from there, he's seemed to have stalled.\n\nHis main strength is verbal: he can talk anyone into anything, or, at least, to anyone about anything. Bill Clinton likes to describe people like Buttigieg as folks who can 'talk the owls down from the trees.'\n\nHis secret strength is that he and his team are ruthlessly strategic when they need to be, ready, for instance, to stealthily drop opposition research on a rival when the time is right. But he still has a Black voter problem — a fatal one if he can't fix it. And some say he's too cerebral, too tidy, too much 'PowerPoint as a person.'\n\nPassion counts in politics. So does messiness. Buttigieg sometimes feels laminated.\n\n#2: Pennsylvania Pretzel\n\nJosh Shapiro is the popular governor of Keystone state, who may have already won the political lottery by being passed over by Harris to be her running mate in 2024.\n\nHis strength is obvious: he's a strong communicator, pragmatic progressive, pro-Israel and middle-of-the-road enough to win over moderates, maybe even some MAGA types.\n\nSecret advantage: He is favored by many of the party's power players — Pelosi, the Obamas, the Clintons.\n\nWeaknesses? The progressive left doesn't trust him, and some party insiders believe he hasn't shown the necessary steel and determination under pressure. In a nomination fight, you can't let incoming fire merely bounce off — you must send some back. Some members of Team Shapiro on aiming to fix this flaw pronto.\n\n#1: California Dream\n\nIt may come as no surprise that Gavin Newsom sits atop the list – not because he's the handsomest governor since the invention of hair gel, though that never hurts – but because he has momentum.\n\nHe's commonly treated like a shadow president in some Democratic circles – meaning he is driving conversation on terms that will be favorable to his candidacy.\n\nNot to mention, he has buckets of donor money, an established national profile and he exceeds the aura of a man auditioning for higher office every time he opens his mouth.\n\nThose are his known strengths. His unknown strength is that he has a killer staff—professional, experienced, and capable of building a national machine at frightening speed.\n\nWeakness? He can come across as a political show pony, all gleam and angles. Quietly, those around him say his ambition sometimes cools at inconvenient moments, often fueled by a family who is not super keen on a race.\n\nThat's the early, very early, list. It will shift. Some will swap out and in as the months go forward. And if you disagree — good. It means you're paying attention.","summary":"The unofficial race for the White House has begun even if the candidates won't admit it.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-15409935/2028-white-house-democrats-newsom-harris-halperin.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/29/17/105085417-0-image-m-18_1767030058660.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/09/2811544641708836953/1024x576_MP4_2811544641708836953.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-29 21:02:30","author":"Editor,Mark Halperin","authors":["Editor","Mark Halperin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.021},{"id":389913054,"title":"Byron Donalds faces racist attacks in Florida’s ugly GOP gubernatorial primary","text":"Florida’s Republican gubernatorial primary is getting ugly. \n\nAhead of next year’s election, nominees are trying to set themselves apart and demonstrate their political viability as they seek to outflank front-runner Byron Donalds, the staunch Trump loyalist who has received the president’s endorsement.\n\nThat desire has led to some eye-popping remarks from fellow GOP candidate James Fishback, who has continually resorted to one insult in particular to undermine Donalds: “slave.” \n\nNBC News reported on Fishback’s ties to allies of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis along with his controversial statements, including his claim that Donalds, who is Black, is a “slave” to “corporate interests” and “tech bros.” Last week, Fishback doubled and tripled down on his racist slur, telling Florida Politics that Donalds “has no right to complain” and shouldn’t be offended by the slur because, Fishback said, the representative’s ancestors weren’t enslaved in the United States.\n\nHis quote invoked themes popularized by some Black conservatives in the extremely online “American Descendants of Slaves” movement, who’ve sought to drive a wedge among Black people by differentiating those with recent immigrant histories from those without such history. \n\nPer Florida Politics, Fishback said:\n\nByron Donalds is a tether. He is not an American descendant of slaves. So when he cries like he has over the last couple of weeks because I call him a slave to the (American Israeli Public Affairs Committee), a slave to corporate interests, a slave to the pro-immigration lobby that has hurt every race of Americans but has also hurt Black Americans who disproportionately work in food, hospitality, leisure, and customer service. He is in no position, has no right to be complaining about me calling him a slave when he has absolutely no direct descendant of slavery in his family. He’s from Panama. He’s from Belize. His dad’s from Jamaica.\n\nOn Friday, Fishback shared a story on social media about Donalds’ fundraising, with a caption that called Donalds a “SLAVE who was auctioned off for $31 million.”\n\nhttps://twitter.com/j_fishback/status/2004569442802667753\n\nDonalds’ office didn’t respond to MS NOW’s request for comment Monday on Fishback’s attacks. \n\nDonalds is one of few Black Republicans in Congress, and he’s often made it his duty to downplay racism in American society, such as last year, when he whitewashed and romanticized the Jim Crow era as a period when “the Black family was together” and voted conservatively. As my former colleague Joy Reid explained to him around that time, the notion was absurd, considering many Black people weren’t allowed to vote at all during that time because of the whole racism thing.\n\nIn an ironic twist, Donalds is now facing the same sort of racist attacks he helped fuel against Vice President Kamala Harris during her presidential bid last year. After Trump and the conservative movement spread baseless misinformation that Harris wasn’t truly Black because she also boasts Indian heritage, Donalds downplayed the controversy and appeared to cast doubt himself on Harris’ Blackness.\n\nNow, it appears he’s getting a taste of his own MAGA medicine as an opponent to his right flank attempts to pull his Black card and label him a “slave.”","url":"https://www.ms.now/opinion/byron-donalds-faces-racist-attacks-in-floridas-ugly-gop-gubernatorial-primary","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1767039767/251229-byron-donalds-es/251229-byron-donalds-es.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 20:51:01","author":"Max Burns","authors":["Max Burns"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.183},{"id":389918446,"title":"Senate pressure mounts as Minnesota fraud scandal continues to unfold","text":"EXCLUSIVE: Senator Jim Banks, R-Ind., is pushing for a federal investigation after sending a letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) calling for the agency to construct investigative reports of Somali networks as the roughly $9 billion fraud scandal in Minnesota continues to unfold. Banks serves on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), which oversees major areas of healthcare funding and policy. The Indiana senator pointed out that the Minnesota Child Care Assistance Program is administered by the state government, but is largely funded by federal tax dollars through two programs that provide roughly $300 million in federal childcare subsidies to Minnesota. On Sunday, Banks sent a letter to Alex J. Adams, the Assistant Secretary for Family Support, leading the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at HHS. TRUMP OFFICIAL FREEZES MILLIONS IN SBA AID TO MINNESOTA, SLAMS WALZ’S POLICIES AS BREEDING ‘ENDEMIC’ FRAUD \"I urge ACF to investigate reports of Somali networks creating fake ‘daycare centers’ as vehicles to steal millions of dollars from Minnesota’s Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP), which administers hundreds of millions of dollars in federal childcare subsidies each year,\" Banks’ letter to HHS reads. \"Clearly, the Walz administration has failed to meet the most basic benchmarks required by ACF,\" Banks explained. \"Any unlawful behavior uncovered in ACF’s investigation must be immediately referred to the proper federal authorities including ICE, the Department of Homeland Security, and Federal prosecutors.\" The Department of Homeland Security’s HSI and ICE agents were on the ground in Minnesota on Monday, and Secretary Kristi Noem posted to X that the agency was \"conducting a massive investigation on childcare and other rampant fraud.\" TIM WALZ PUSHES BACK ON MINNESOTA FRAUD ALLEGATIONS FOLLOWING VIRAL DAYCARE VIDEO Noem noted there’s more information coming as to the DHS investigation. Federal authorities in Minnesota opened a separate probe in 2022 into Feeding Our Future, a nonprofit that prosecutors later said played a central role in what would become one of the most extensive COVID-era relief fraud cases ever uncovered. As the case unfolded, investigators identified roughly $250 million in false claims, with 78 people ultimately facing criminal charges. Prosecutors have indicated the broader fraud tied to the scheme could reach as high as $9 billion. GOP LAWMAKER UNVEILS WALZ ACT AFTER BILLIONS LOST IN MINNESOTA FRAUD SCANDAL A significant number of those charged were members of Minnesota’s Somali community. The scandal also sparked internal backlash within the state government. More than 400 Minnesota employees raised concerns that Gov. Tim Walz, who later became the Democratic vice presidential nominee on the Kamala Harris ticket, failed to respond adequately to repeated warnings about fraud and allowed retaliation against whistleblowers who tried to bring the misconduct to light. Banks notes the importance of ensuring everyone behind the scandal is brought to justice, as well as holding elected officials and those who had responsibility over the matter accountable.

It's true that some things just come out of the blue. \n\nBut many disasters are entirely predictable, and a good chunk of them could be prevented or mitigated if people made common-sense decisions based on clear cost/benefit calculations. \n\nYet time and again, policymakers will pretend that problems don't exist or even pursue policies that will make things worse, even though they have every reason to know that when the crisis comes, it will be a disaster.\n\nSometimes that is because, in the short term, they or their friends benefit from the policies. Sometimes, because averting them will cause short-term pain, and they are too afraid or too worried about losing their jobs to do what is necessary. And sometimes they believe that \"This time will be different,\" or they are caught up in a mania. \n\nWhatever the reason, it's the people who warn about the looming disaster who are seen as the bad guys, and even when they are proven to be right, most of the time, they are resented. \n\nConsider just a couple of examples:the welfare fraud that is finally being exposed, and the coming crash in gender ideology. In each of these cases, the people who had the power to avert the crisis went out of their way to make things worse for short-term gain, leaving a trail of victims and the entire society worse off.\n\nI chose those three because there was no particular lack of foresight or credible warnings, and the policymakers chose to exacerbate them for political gain. \n\nStill no coverage in NYT, WaPo, CNN, or Minneapolis Star-Tribune of massive fraud being uncovered in Minnesota. The media's willingness to ignore stories that hurt Democrats is truly astonishing. pic.twitter.com/xZcZcbUSm9— Tom Bevan (@TomBevanRCP) December 29, 2025\n\nOutside people who only pay attention to the Pravda Media, which still has failed to cover the Somali welfare fraud to any great extent, Americans are waking up to the fact that, at least in Minnesota, around half or even more of the money spent to help indigent people is stolen, and often with the implicit aid of policymakers. \n\nI am very, very confident that Minnesota is the tip of the iceberg. I have little doubt that when all is said and done, tens or hundreds of billions of dollars will have flown out of our coffers to scammers, and I have about the same amount of doubt that high-level politicians and policymakers knew about much of the fraud. \n\nConsider the Daycare fraud that goes on in Minnesota. Law enforcement has known about it to some extent at least for about 8 years, and even prosecuted a few cases back then. \n\nThis is from a 2018 Minnesota criminal prosecution against Somali daycare fraudsters.In surveillance video, Somali parents would take their kids to the daycare, check them in, and then leave with them moments later.The owners of the daycare would then bill the state for a… pic.twitter.com/oXgbl2qtYj— Greg Price (@greg_price11) December 29, 2025\n\nWalz: “This is what happens when they scapegoat and this is what they happens when they no longer hide the idea of white supremacy…” Shirley: “Tim wants votes… There are entire apartment complexes where white people have been pushed out of these apartment complexes because Somalians have taken over.”“If you have a hundred thousand people that will vote for you … you're gonna enable and let this stuff happen.”\n\nEverybody is \"shocked\" by Nick Shirley's uncovering more than $100 million in likely fraud in just a day, but I wasn't, and I am willing to bet that nobody at high levels of government is either. I know legislators who have been trying to fight this for years and who have been vilified for doing so. \n\nWalz has known about this all along, and his administration has facilitated it for exactly the reasons Nick Shirley said. That was not a genius insight, with all due respect to Nick, but an obvious one. And even now, when the exposure of the fraud is an existential threat, many politicians are scared of the Somali vote, which has become so strong for the Democrats. \n\nThe Somali fraud complex is huge. Daycare fraud, autism centers, Feeding Our Future...The tab will grow past $10 billion in just a few years, and anybody who cares to know about it does. \n\nBut...for all involved, the incentives to keep it going were huge, even when they knew a cliff was at the end of the road. The incentive structure for maintaining the status quo was too great, and the problems were always in the future. \n\nThe same was true of gender ideology. Liberals wanted a new civil rights crusade, and the trans issue seemed to fit the bill after gay marriage passed. It appealed to the AWFLs and satisfied the big activist groups that give awards and money, and happened to make a lot of money for politically connected and wealthy doctors. \n\nSome people got caught up in the mania, but many more secretly worried that this was a bad idea; but opposing it meant paying a very high political price and perhaps career suicide, so they jumped on the bandwagon. \n\nIt paid dividends, until it didn't. Ask Kamala Harris about that, for instance, and take a look at the popularity of the Democratic Party. But even now, when the political price to be paid is high to stay on that bandwagon, the Democrats are staying because the true crash hasn't come. Everybody can see it coming, but when Gavin Newsom and Seth Moulton tried to pull back, they were whipped into line. \n\nIt will take another massive loss at the ballot box, and one that is totally predictable, to break the spell. \n\nWe face countless crises that are totally predictable, and in many cases, the people who are charged with averting them know they are coming and will do nothing. Whether it is dealing with the national debt, military procurement practices, Social Security, Medicare, or massive fraud in government, the short-term costs of doing the right thing exceed, in their minds, the long-term benefit.\n\nTrump was elected to break the stalemate, and at least he has the courage to attack the status quo. But as you can see, many Congressmen do not.\n\nCan he succeed? Not in one term. Without a MAGA successor, it's hard to see how things improve in the long run. So we better work hard to elect a successor who is willing to take on the status quo.","url":"https://hotair.com/david-strom/2025/12/29/nothing-happens-until-things-are-broken-n3810315","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/342/989b7995-bc8a-4f78-9541-0662ab916506.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 20:30:04","author":"David Strom","authors":["David Strom"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.546},{"id":389950456,"title":"ROOKE: Democrats Willing To Chase Political Pipe Dream Straight Off A Cliff","text":"Democrats seem to be feeling energized by some recent positive results and a classic piece of liberal media optimism that paints a picture of supposed cracks in President Donald Trump’s rural support due to tariffs and policy reforms. But history shows they might be in over their skis.\n\nPolitico reported Saturday that Democrats believe they have a chance to gain significant support from voters in GOP strongholds in rural America. The story exemplifies how the Democratic Party, fueled by wishful thinking and a visceral desire to beat Trump at any cost, is poised to squander significant resources on an illusory opportunity in rural America. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) rolled out an eight-figure investment into a first-ever dedicated rural outreach program, complete with staff hires, voter mobilization, and ads featuring disgruntled farmers.\n\nAt first glance, this appears to be strategic. Democrats cite Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s November gubernatorial win in which she captured 46 percent of rural voters and outperformed former Vice President Kamala Harris in 48 of 52 rural localities by attacking Trump’s tariffs and emphasizing affordability concerns. (Sign up for Mary Rooke’s weekly newsletter here!)\n\n“We have a unique opening because of all that’s happening with this administration,” Democratic Illinois Rep. Nikki Budzinski told Politico. She added that farmers and rural voters, who make up a significant portion of her district, “might be listening in a more unique way than they maybe have ever in the past. And we need to walk through that door.”\n\n Compete everywhere… this isn’t just about one cycle. We must have a longterm strategic plan to re-engage and eventually win back rural communities. #DirtRoadDemocrats @DirtRoadPAC https://t.co/0M0j1goVcA — Jaime Harrison (@harrisonjaime) December 1, 2025\n\nPolitical realities should show this as a profound misallocation of Democratic Party resources. Their move is driven more by ideological fervor and headline-chasing than by prudent political calculus. For example, Spanberger’s success in Virginia is notable but does not translate nationally. Virginia’s rural areas are influenced by proximity to suburban federal workers, and her centrist branding resonated in a state with unique demographics. Replicating her rural gains in deeper-red rural heartlands — like the Midwest or the Great Plains — requires overcoming decades of perceived Democratic neglect.\n\nDemocrats already lost a bid to pick up a rural seat in Tennessee. Republican candidate Matt Van Epps beat Democratic candidate Aftyn Behn for retiring Republican Rep. Mark Green’s vacant seat Dec. 2. Van Epps’ district is a quintessential red stronghold, stretching from parts of Nashville to rural Tennessee. Republicans have historically dominated here. Still, Democrats deployed their new affordability campaign strategy hoping for an upset.\n\nIn the end, Van Epps beat Behn by 9 points. While narrower than Trump’s 22-point win over Harris, Van Epps’ victory showed a hole in Democrats’ new plan.\n\nNicholas Jacobs and Daniel Shea note in their 2023 book, The Rural Voter: The Politics of Place and the Disuniting of America, that perceptions of Democratic indifference are deeply entrenched among rural voters. Authenticity and sustained presence are required to rebuild trust, not sporadic ad buys or listening tours. These voters still remember what happened to their family farms and rural communities after elite-driven trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which devastated local economies, imposed regulatory burdens on farming, and created cultural disconnects.\n\n Rural Americans deserve to be seen, heard and supported. That isn’t happening in D.C. Democrats can change that – and we plan to. https://t.co/zilveS3ubr — Andy Beshear (@AndyBeshearKY) December 9, 2025\n\nAdditionally, the opportunity cost for Democrats is staggering. Midterms historically favor the opposition, but only if resources are deployed efficiently. Diverting eight figures to erode margins in unwinnable rural districts dilutes efforts in competitive suburbs or urban turnout operations where Democrats are more likely to generate positive voter support. Democrats even admit that rural communities won’t be a gold mine of election-day votes. They merely seek to chip away at 80+ Trump margins.\n\nThe real reason Democrats are touting this campaign strategy and Politico is giving them the runway to do it is because it keeps donors engaged. It’s performative politics for elites sitting inside their offices, visualizing narratives of Democratic inroads in Trump country to generate media buzz.\n\nThe issue is that it spreads a bruised and battered Democratic Party, still recovering from 2024, too thin. They are diverting millions from winnable suburbs or shoring up their base, all for marginal erosion in places they’ll never flip. This Politico narrative offers false hope post-2024 that Democrats have been hoping for to drum up much-needed donor dollars, but in return could forfeit real opportunities elsewhere. (ROOKE: Trump Admin Sends Much-Needed Lifeline To American Farmers Just In Nick Of Time)\n\nThat doesn’t mean that Republicans shouldn’t remain vigilant in their duties to support rural America. After all, complacency is why Republicans were able to win over blue-collar voters after decades of being staunchly pro-Democrat. It’s now more important than ever for the GOP to deliver tangible results. It’s the only way to keep their massive rural bloc securely red.\n\nFollow Mary Rooke on X: @MaryRooke\n\nSign up for Mary Rooke’s weekly newsletter here!","summary":"The opportunity cost for Democrats is staggering","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/12/29/democrats-republicans-rural-voters-midwest-trump-virginia-abigail-spanberger/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn01.dailycaller.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F12%2FGettyImages-1523049116-scaled-e1767033742227.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 20:06:39","author":"Mary Rooke","authors":["Mary Rooke"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.032},{"id":389935648,"title":"Frustrated Trump voters say president hasn’t ‘tried at all’ to tackle key issues ahead of midterms: report","text":"A growing number of Americans who voted for President Donald Trump to return to the White House are starting to disagree with him on some key issues ahead of next year’s midterm elections. \n\nWhile most of the voters who got Trump re-elected still support him, some have raised concerns about his handling of issues like immigration and the economy – as well as what they see as an apparent lack of follow-through, according to a new report by NBC News. \n\nOnly a handful of the more than 50 voters surveyed over the course of the past year fell completely off the Trump train. However, a large portion of that group is now sounding the alarm on his apparent abandonment of some campaign promises, including tackling inflation and the high cost of living, according to the report. \n\nAn overlapping group also balked at the administration’s deportation policies, according to the report, which was conducted by NBC and produced by Syracuse University and research firms Engagious and Sago. \n\nVoters in the focus groups were nearly unanimous in approving of Trump’s performance in the months immediately after he took office – but that started to change as the year went on, according to the report. \n\n\"Many of these voters gave President Trump a long runway well into the summer because they believed that he understands how business works better than they do and that his own fortune would eventually translate to enriching the country and their own finances or because they felt so strongly that unchecked immigration was a huge problem that needed a huge fix,\" said Margaret Talev, director of Syracuse University’s Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship.\n\n\"But as the year wore on, we have seen a shift among these voters collectively, cracks in their faith, more questioning, oscillating or outright change of heart about Trump,\" Talev said. \"What we almost never see is a wish for a do-over vote or a rush toward Democrats for the answer.”\n\nMany of those surveyed were divided on Trump’s tariffs from the start. Others expressed disappointment that the president hasn’t focused more on tackling inflation. Even still, many gave the president grace in failing to make good on some of his campaign promises. \n\n“I think he has a grand master plan that most of us probably don’t understand,” Rozlyn C., a 44-year-old Georgia voter of Cuban descent, said. “I have faith that he, a hundred percent, has the best interest of our country at heart.” \n\nFewer than half of Trump voters across four focus groups said they felt he had made fighting inflation a top priority, according to the report. \n\n“I expected him to be aggressive in a lot of different areas and he’s doing exactly that – being aggressive in a lot of different areas of focus that concern the U.S. citizens. Every few days you’re hearing something different and you’re constantly seeing him at work, working, getting stuff done,” said 56-year-old independent Dorris S. \n\nHowever, some Trump voters were more critical of his efforts to combat inflation. \n\nRobert L., a 54-year-old Virginia resident who backed a Democrat in a November election for governor, said Trump’s comments about inflation improving are “delusional” and show that he is “out of touch.” \n\nAnother Virginia resident, Justin K., said he didn’t think Trump “tried at all” to tackle inflation. \n\n“He’s been focused on prosecuting his political enemies, pardoning people,” he said. “I don’t even think that there’s much a president can do on inflation, but I think that this was a kind of situation where he just said it to get elected.” \n\nThe president’s widespread tariffs also revealed a vast divide amongst his voters, with some voters expressing concerns about them hurting businesses. \n\n“I think that it’s ridiculous that we haven’t been charging tariffs for decades and we’re starting to equalize it,” said Hector L., a 55-year-old North Carolina voter who was born in Puerto Rico.\n\nHowever, some voters felt the tariffs unfairly impacted Americans. \n\n“Tariffs are a tax on the American people. That’s who pays for it, so I don’t support it,” said David S., a 47-year-old from New Jersey. “Every tariff that is put in place, from when Biden is putting ‘em in place, Trump putting them in place, they are taxes on the people who are importing. The people who are buying those imports are paying the tax.”\n\nMeanwhile, other voters said they were optimistic about Trump’s economic policies, stating they feel the country would still be worse off if Kamala Harris or Joe Biden had been elected instead. \n\n“I feel that if we were in the hands of Kamala Harris or Joe Biden, that our country would be doing a lot worse than it already was. I feel like Trump has amended some of those wrongs that were done,” said Harmony D., a 26-year-old Michigan resident and independent who has voted for Trump twice. \n\nOther voters, however, called out Trump’s economic practices as being solely for his own benefit. \n\n“It’s a bait and switch with him where he said he was for the average person but he actually favors big business, and then just does whatever he wants and there’s no consequences,” Virginia’s Justin K. said.\n\nSome of those voters surveyed for the focus group also expressed concerns over Trump’s tackling of immigration issues, namely the administration’s deportation policies. \n\n“When it comes to immigration, a lot of respondents told us this year, ‘I like what the President is doing, but I don’t like how he’s doing it.’ This suggests they’re struggling to reconcile their vote for the President with executive actions they find troubling,” said Rich Thau of Engagious, who moderated the focus group sessions. \n\nThe report from NBC comes as Trump hits an all-time low approval rating of just 36 percent, according to a recent Gallup poll. \n\nIt’s the worst rating of any U.S. president at the end of their first year in power in the last 50 years. It also ties with Trump’s approval rating at the end of his first term in December 2017, when he received the same approval rating. \n\nAnother poll conducted by the NBC News Decision Desk last month found that both mainstream Republicans and those who identify as MAGA reported dissatisfaction with Trump.\n\nThe latest polling reveals a decline amongst his normally dedicated MAGA base. Although 70 percent continue to support him, the president has seen an eight-point drop from 78 percent in April.\n\nSupport for the president has fallen amongst mainstream Republicans, too, with approval dropping from 38 percent in April to 35 percent.\n\nThe poll also noted that there has been a drop in the number of Republicans who identify as MAGA. In April, 57 percent of Republicans polled considered themselves MAGA, compared to 43 percent who did not. \n\nThat number has now dropped down to 50-50, according to the poll.","summary":"White House’s handling of the economy and its deportation policy raising concern among Trump supporters","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-voters-turn-midturn-elections-b2891727.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/29/16/50/GettyImages-2253856109.jpeg?crop=5687,3791.3,x0,y0.3&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/YzF6xoHi-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-29 19:58:54","author":"Isabel Keane","authors":["Isabel Keane"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.012},{"id":389940226,"title":"Will Minnesota Prosecute Nick Shirley for His Flagrant Act of Journalism?","text":"As of right now, Shirley's post with the 42-minute video of his investigation has more than 110 million views on X.\n\n🚨 Here is the full 42 minutes of my crew and I exposing Minnesota fraud, this might be my most important work yet.

He's elbows-deep in the thing and not only knew about the fraud, but \"systematically retaliated against whistleblowers using monitoring, threats, [and] repression.\" Here's more from that report:\n\n\"Instead of partnership, we got the full weight of retaliation by Tim Walz, certain DFL members, and an indifferent mainstream media,\" Minnesota DHS writes. \"It's scary, isolating, and left us wondering who we can turn to.\"\"In addition to retaliating against whistleblower (sic), Tim Walz disempowered the Office of the Legislative Auditor, allowing agencies to disregard their audit findings and guidance. Media and politicians supporting Tim Walz or the DFL-agenda attacked whistleblowers who were trying to raise red flags on fraudulent activities,\" the post continues.\"This is a cascade of systemic failures leading up to Tim Walz. Agency leaders appointed by Tim Walz willfully disregarded rules and laws to keep fraud reports quiet — even to the extent of threatening the families of whistleblowers,\" the post reads.\"As staff, we firsthand witnessed and observed fraud happening, yet we were shut down, reassigned, and told to keep quiet. Sometimes more. Leadership did not want to appear to discriminate against certain communities and were unwilling to take action such as stopping fraud, that would have an adverse impact on their image,\" the group wrote.\n\nThis is clearly a guy who has no problem retaliating against whistleblowers and someone who is cruel and petty.\n\nOn top of that, Attorney General Keith Ellison appears to have had a hand in the scandal, vowing to battle state agencies that were flagging applications for potential fraud.\n\nThat being said, I have to wonder this: will Minnesota attempt to charge Nick Shirley for his flagrant act of journalism? \n\nI fear they might.\n\nAnd the precedent is there, thanks to Kamala Harris. Back in 2016, Kamala Harris, who was then California's Attorney General, filed charges against pro-life journalists David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt. Why? Two years prior, they blew the lid off a story that showed Planned Parenthood was illegally harvesting and selling the body parts of aborted babies for profit.\n\nHarris got that ball rolling, and her successor, Xavier Becerra, filed felony charges against the two after Harris left the position and joined the Senate.\n\nOn top of that, her office illegally colluded with abortion providers and pro-abortion advocacy groups while she pursued that criminal case.\n\nAnd I'm not the only one to think this, either.\n\nI mean, why not?What’s the difference between Keith Ellison and Hasan Piker’s worldview? pic.twitter.com/MVDOdCU6j6— Mark Ashworth (@marklarflash) December 28, 2025\n\n\"idk what kind of fraud somalis in daycares are doing but i think it's a separate crime to try and storm w a camera into a daycare w kids in it???\" wrote Hasan Piker (spelling in context).\n\nAnd attorney Marc J.

The sketch has become infamous because it never went to air — at least with Rudolph starring as Obama. After all these years, she's finally revealing why.\n\n \"It was a sketch where you and [Darrell Hammond] were Hillary and Bill Clinton at a Halloween party,\" Rudolph explained. \"I remember Barack was new on the scene, looking smooth. And at that time, I think Barack Obama masks were popular, because he was the new candidate. So the joke was going to be that I come in like, 'I'm Barack Obama!' and then he taps me on the shoulder with his mask and takes the mask off and he goes, 'Oh my God, it's the real Barack Obama.'\"\n\n The sketch, also featuring Fred Armisen, Will Forte, Bill Hader, Simon Rich, and Jason Sudeikis as various Democratic operatives, was to air as the cold open to the fourth episode of season 33 in 2007. \"We did that at dress,\" Rudolph said. \"And that was it. We did not do it at air. Thank God.\"\n\n Perplexed, Poehler asked Rudolph, \"Why? Do we know why?\" Rudolph's response was simple: \"I do. I mean, I did not have a take on Barack Obama at all.\"\n\n Rudolph said it was a brief and enigmatic exchange during dress rehearsal with the politician, then a senator from Illinois who had just launched his first bid for the presidency, that put a kabosh on her plan to double him in the sketch.\n\n \"I remember the first time we saw each other was when we were about to walk out onstage,\" she recalled. \"I'm there waiting in my little Brooks Brothers suit, and I think we bound my boobs, and I used to play Scott Joplin, so I had my Scott Joplin wig on and I was standing there... he came over and I said, 'Well, what do you think?' And all he said to me was, 'I don't wear a three-button suit.' I still don't know what that means. That's like a guy knowledge thing.\"\n\n Rudolph can admit that she \"didn't have a good impression\" of Obama, though it's a somewhat improbable claim, given her lauded characterization of Kamala Harris during the recent presidential election cycle, and her previous appearances as former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\n\n Though Rudolph's Obama impression didn't ultimately make the cut, a revised version of the sketch did open the 2007 episode. It marked the debut of Jason Sudeikis' impression of Joe Biden, and saw Obama trade subtle barbs with Poehler's Clinton, whom he would run against and eventually defeat in the 2008 primary election. Obama was also given the honor of delivering the famed cut to credits, \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\"\n\n You can watch the rest of Maya Rudolph's appearance on the Good Hang podcast above.","summary":"Rudolph laughed when recalling her canned impression of the former president, \"I did not have a take on Barack Obama at all.\"","url":"https://ew.com/maya-rudolph-reveals-what-barack-obama-told-her-after-unaired-snl-sketch-11872863","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/MndBXN_ddhnbj5W9hy8zMYF5Zhs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Maya-Rudolph-Obama-121825-e8092a11169c46aeb910ffd91a1d600c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 19:00:00","author":"Ryan Coleman","authors":["Ryan Coleman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.169},{"id":389943244,"title":"Sister Bay trustee, Husby's owner allegedly burned Charlie Kirk shirt","text":"Chad Kodanko, a Sister Bay village trustee and part-owner of Husby's Food and Spirits, reportedly set a Charlie Kirk sweatshirt on fire, prompting threats and leading to his decision to leave the business and resign from the village board.\n\nIt's unclear what exactly transpired, but Kodanko apologized for his \"inappropriate behavior.\" The Door County Sheriff's Office said there is no active investigation because the office is waiting for the complainant to provide more information about what happened.\n\nWisconsin Right Now, a conservative outlet, first reported that Kodanko allegedly burned a bartender's sweatshirt in front of employees on Dec. 12.

Marjorie Taylor Greene is still swinging at Donald Trump, even with just a few days left before her planned resignation.\n\nThe firebrand Georgia representative announced that she would leave Congress on January 5, one week from Monday, amid her growing feud with the president and her disatisfaction with the work of the Republican-held House of Representatives. Her exit will leave Speaker Mike Johnson with an even slimmer majority in the chamber, further weakening the increasingly unsteady Johnson who is facing grumblings and threats of rebellion from both moderates and hardliners in his caucus.\n\nBut if anyone thought Greene’s last few days in Congress would be uneventful, they were wrong. Even with Congress not yet back in session for the new year and Greene hundreds of miles away from the hallway interviews of the Hill, the congresswoman has trained her focus on Trump and what she says is his continued failure to hold true to an “America First” policy platform she says his MAGA Republican base supports.\n\nIn a New York Times profile published Monday, Greene outlined the beginnings of her break with Trump. She highlighted the president’s remarks at the funeral of Charlie Kirk, where Trump seemed to mock Kirk for rejecting hatred in politics, telling a crowd: “I hate my opponent and I don’t want what’s best for them.”\n\nGreene said Trump’s remark revealed him to be faithless: ““That was absolutely the worst statement... It just shows where his heart is. And that’s the difference, with her having a sincere Christian faith, and proves that he does not have any faith.”\n\nThe remark is one of the congresswoman’s most personal criticisms of the president to date and comes as she continues to accuse both Trump and Johnson of being out of touch with Americans, particularly on issues surrounding economic hardship and cost-of-living. While Greene’s criticisms have largely been focused on policy, she has also pointed out the wave of threats her office received after her dispute with the president began and blamed Trump’s own personal bullying for causing it. In recent interviews, Greene has suggested that she recognizes her own role in the acceleration of American politics into a toxic wasteland, and feels regret over MAGA’s contributions to that dynamic.\n\nShe reiterated that belief to the Times in early December, according to the newspaper: “Our side has been trained by Donald Trump to never apologize and to never admit when you’re wrong. You just keep pummeling your enemies, no matter what. And as a Christian, I don’t believe in doing that. I agree with Erika Kirk, who did the hardest thing possible and said it out loud.”\n\nHer hesitance to descend into mudslinging hasn’t stopped the departing congresswoman from critiquing Trump’s priorities in the final days of her service. Over the past several months, Greene’s long history of skepticism towards foreign intervention or assistance of any kind led her to become one of the Republican Party’s leading critics of support for Benjamin Netanyahu’s government in Israel, including Israel’s brutal siege of Gaza over the past two years. The congresswoman has repeatedly argued that Trump is focused on foreign policy objectives over a domestic agenda aimed at cost-cutting in the federal government and dealing with the economic woes of the voters who elected him over Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nShe also was one of a few Republicans to prominently defy Trump on the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\nIn a pair of tweets Sunday and Monday, Greene once again made those arguments, writing in one: “DOGE was one of the most popular plans of the ‘24 campaign because Americans are beyond furious about the insane amount of waste, fraud, and abuse. Just outright stealing. Which is why I created the DOGE Subcommittee... [p]erhaps now the Speaker and the admin will take DOGE more seriously.”\n\nGreene lamented Trump’s back-to-back meetings with Netanyahu and, on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago in another tweet, exclaiming: “Can we just do America?”\n\nHer criticisms of Trump’s own social and political circles to the Times revealed a broader disgust with Trumpism and the public face MAGA chooses to present to the world, at Mar-a-Lago and in the media.\n\n“I never liked the MAGA Mar-a-Lago sexualization,” she told the Times. “I have two daughters, and I’ve always been uncomfortable with how those women puff up their lips and enlarge their breasts.”\n\nTrump and Greene’s dispute seemed by some political observers to be a long time coming, however. The Georgia congresswoman has been a frequent source of embarassing headlines for the Republican Party due to her past espousement of conspiracy theories including one often-mocked example where she suggested that devices in space controlled by the wealthy Rothschild family could be behind wildfires in the U.S., sparking the “Jewish Space Lasers” meme.\n\nIn Georgia, two major political battles are due to be fought in 2026: A race for Jon Ossoff’s seat in the U.S. Senate, and a gubernatorial election. Trump, as a kingmaker in Republican primaries, has been known to spurn even loyalists if he views them as weak general election candidates, such as was the case for Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia’s elections in 2025.\n\nGreene confirmed earlier this year that Trump’s longtime pollster Tony Fabrizio commissioned a survey showing her losing the Senate race by double digits, and seemingly was already working for one of her would-be opponents. While she furiously denied a report that Trump himself had urged her not to run for Senate, Fabrizio’s loyalties could be taken as a sign of Trump’s, too.\n\nFiring back at the congresswoman, Trump has attacked Greene as “crazy” and claimed that he was considering support for a primary challenger in her congressional district before she chose to resign.","summary":"Greene attacks Mar-a-Lago culture for overly sexualizing women and Trump for his reaction to Charlie Kirk’s death as rejection of MAGA becomes all-encompassing","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-kirk-eulogy-b2891687.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/26/17/44/GettyImages-2064219528.jpeg?crop=3864,2576,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/QwdStJwY-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-29 18:16:04","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.353},{"id":389868364,"title":"It Takes A Village of Somalis To Defraud Minnesota","text":"As a Californian, when it comes to fraud at the state level, whether it's disappearing federal money, state money, or local money, we stand at the summit. No matter which way you look, not one of the other 49 states in the Union comes close our eye level in wasting money in fraudulant fashion the way we do here in the Golden State. Let me give you just one example. In 1996, by way of a state initiative, the California Scam Tram, the Little Train That Couldn't, the Train From Nowhere To Nowhere got underway. Except it didn't. Originally plotted to be a high-speed rail that would take passengers from Los Angeles to San Francisco by 2020, at a cost of $10 billion dollars, the train still doesn't exist. Nor does the track, the electrical lines, nor the infrastructure. After thirty years, all that can be said for it in the way of progress is a regular train track that's meant to be a supply line to the high-speed track that isn't there. In short, this project alone, (and mind you, California's various fraudulant programs are as ubiquitous as sunlight), has not laid a single mile of track to date, has spent well north of $15 billion dollars to not lay that track, now boasts a future cost of $128 billion when it's completed sometime in the mid 2030's, (which it won't), and it's ambitious L.A.-S.F. termination cities has been scaled back. You will ultimately, so long as the money and Democrats don't run out, be whisked away from Bakersfield, 113 miles north of the City of Angels, to Merced, which is 130 miles to the south of the City on the Bay. Keep in mind, it's only 383 miles if you drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco, and after four decades and $130 billion dollars, the high-speed rail will only get you a little over halfway. You're on your own for the rest of the distance. Whenever I see reports surface of fraud going on in another state, I typically scoff. But over the last couple of weeks, seeing the reports of the breadth and depth of fraud the Somali community has perpetrated on the state of Minnesota, and by extension the federal taxpayers, it's enough to make this cynical Californian stand up and applaud. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, allegedly vetted at one time by former Obama Attorney General Eric Holder as the best choice for Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's emergency vice-presidential nominee in 2024, has been absolutely John Belushi-esque in delivering excuses for the fraud rampant in the Gopher State. In regards to the fraudulant Medicaid food, housing, autism support, a story that our friends Scott Johnson and John Hinderaker have owned from the beginning at Powerline Blog, totaling close to $9 billion dollars across 14 different programs thus far, Walz has had no shortage of people to blame. \n\nI mean, the only thing missing is Carrie Fisher standing over him in the sewer with a shotgun, right? In January, 1996, then-First Lady Hillary Clinton released her book, It Takes A Village, and began an odyssey about how your kids aren't really your kids, and that it takes all of us to raise them properly. She repeated that mantra later in the year at the Democratic National Convention when the party renominated William Jefferson Blythe Clinton, who for all intents and purposes had by then bedded the village. According to some pretty terrific reporting from Nick Shirley over the Christmas holiday, it appears that to Minnesotan Somalis, it takes a lot of the village's money to raise their kids. Except in taking this fraud to the chef's kiss level, there's not even any kids involved. It's just taking the money to run empty buildings. Shifting from one movie reference to another, Belushi and Fisher in The Blues Brothers to 1974's Blazing Saddles, the Somalis have essentially built, with your tax dollars, a whole bunch of fake Rock Ridge daycare centers, which have no children in them for which to provide care. \n\n🚨 Here is the full 42 minutes of my crew and I exposing Minnesota fraud, this might be my most important work yet. We uncovered over $110,000,000 in ONE day. Like it and share it around like wildfire! Its time to hold these corrupt politicians and fraudsters accountableWe ALL… pic.twitter.com/E3Penx2o7a— Nick shirley (@nickshirleyy) December 26, 2025\n\nThree-quarters of an hour of wall-to-wall fraud. Somalis are buying homes, in some cases, using federal and state assistance to get the mortgages, then filing immediately as daycare centers, getting subsidies monthly to pay for the mortgages. Are there kids? Nope. Is anyone from the state checking? Seemingly not. Again, looking at this as a Californian, it's fantastic in scale. California's current budget is somewhere in the neighborhood of $325 billion dollars, servicing 39.5 million people, legal and illegal combined. God only knows how much of that is spent fraudulantly. Actually, there are some Republicans who know, and put the number north of $70 billion. Perhaps Nick could take a swing out west when he's finished burying Tim Walz and the Democrats In the Minnesota first. By comparison, the Gopher state's current budget is only $66 billion, which handles 5.8 million people. That's about $11,300 per person in spending versus California's $9,240 per capita. Minnesota is rapidly rising in the spending per capita list, sitting currently in 13th place among the other states. Calfornia ranks dead last. If you're curious whether this is just a blip and they'll eventually fall back in line with the rest of the states, guess again. Governor Walz yesterday, in the face of evidence of fraud wherever you find Minnesotan Somalis congregated, doubled down. He wants to give them more money in a new way. \n\n🚨 INFURIATING: Despite the MASSIVE Somali fraud scandal, Tim Walz announces a NEW welfare program for Somalis and other illegalsThe taxpayer-funded family and medical leave program gives Somalis up to 20 PAID WEEKS OFF PER YEAR to “bond” with a childCUT OFF FEDERAL FUNDS!… pic.twitter.com/s1EQ1SFT7d— Nick Sortor (@nicksortor) December 27, 2025\n\nWho needs a fake Somali learing center when you can just claim to have a kid, not have to actually prove it, and get 5 months of paid vacation time on taxpayers?

Instead of stopping the digging when his social welfare programs have proven to be the laughing stock of the country, he holds a press conference to introduce a brand-new shovel. Now I know what you're saying. Media isn't covering this new scandal. In fact, the Star-Tribune and Pioneer Press, the two papers of the Twin Cities, haven't spent so much as a column inch on the story. The glorious thing about 2025, and a trend that shows it will accelerate going into 2026, is that people are not getting their news from old leftist media anymore. That 42-minute Nick Shirley video I showed you earlier? 90 million views in two days. 90 million! Not bad for a 23-year-old kid doing the unthinkable - reporting and journalism.

I'm sure they figured once the Medicaid scandal broke, they'd deploy pundits, obfuscate, have Walz lie and spin away in press conferences, and that would be the end of it. Now, another huge front in the Somali fire has opened up, and it's totally uncontained. What do you want to wager that this isn't the only fraud being committed by elements in the Somali community? To date, there's four different sets of scandals relating to Somali fraud of federal and state welfare dollars. Besides the fake daycare and autism/Medicaid fraud, there are a bunch of programs dealing with COVID relief and public benefits that Somalis seem to have taken advantage of to the tune of several hundred million dollars. And the fourth, so far, is a ton of money illegally obtained through the auspices of children's hunger relief. Your gut should tell you by now this won't be the last set of programs Somalis have apparently figured out how to game. All this makes what Walz did yesterday, announcing the new 20-week paid family leave for Somalis plan, just wild. Typically, as a practical matter, when you have four active wildfires consuming everything in their path in your state, the recommended solution is not usually to go out and start fire number 5 on camera as a distraction from the damage caused by the other four. You know who's been eerily quiet about Walz' problems the last couple of weeks? Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom, for two very different reasons. Harris, who aspires, according to Axios a couple weeks ago, to run for the presidency again in 2028, would seemingly have to begin a new campaign by having to answer questions about the wisdom of her first major decision as a candidate in 2024 - the selection of Walz as her VP nominee. Not a great position for her now, so she's very quietly going on lefty podcasts in order to sell a couple books a week, hoping this story, and if necessary, Walz, just goes away.In Newsom's case, as I said at the beginning, he's no stranger to fraud and corruption. Upon seeing Walz and the Democrats inch closer to the tens of billions mark, Republicans in my state are telling any outlet that will listen, including Newsmax, to hold my beer. Newsom has surpassed $70 billion in fraud. \n\nGavin Newsom has now SURPASSED Tim Walz as the biggest fraud..An estimated $70 BILLION has gone missing.. 👀 pic.twitter.com/UzOTDi3vng— American AF 🇺🇸 (@iAnonPatriot) December 26, 2025\n\nThe bottom line is that Somalis are the opportunists here. The fraud is being made possible by Democrats. And it will continue in blue states until those states run out of money or get voted out in disgrace. I'm not optimistic about the latter, because if there's one thing Democrats keep figuring out how to do is convince enough voters nationally to give Democrats a try again at the White House and Congress for no other reason than to restart the gravy train of grift. We are about to turn the page on the calendar to a year leading up to Midterm elections, contests that will decide which party controls the Legislative Branch for the next two years. If all the fraud being exposed now makes you nauseous, imagine what two years of stalemates and continuing resolutions locking in current levels of spending that made all this fraud possible will do. I don't know about you, but I believe strongly that the village, and the country, can certainly stand to have a lot fewer Democrats running parts of it. Vote them all out.","url":"https://hotair.com/generalissimo/2025/12/29/it-takes-a-village-of-somalis-to-defraud-minnesota-n3810304","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/303/6910a444-c555-4a5c-866b-db2a1a6f3c80.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 16:50:00","author":"Duane Patterson","authors":["Duane Patterson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":389924614,"title":"The Most Popular Stories of 2025","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nThis year, Slate approached the news in many ways: head-on, confronting the realities of a second Trump administration, and from unique, at times playful, angles.\n\nMany of our top articles covered the tumult of this first year of the Trump presidency—from the Department of Government Efficiency’s purge to the renewed interest in the president’s connection to Jeffrey Epstein.

It’s less a question of magnitude than a measurement of distance.\n\nThis excludes Joe Biden, because his reputation died on June 27, 2024, when his brain disintegrated on national TV. And it excludes Jeffrey Epstein, because his name was already garbage. (Now, he’s more famous garbage.) \n\nA loser can’t lose what he never had.\n\nIt also excludes the Democratic Party, because their reputational nosedive primarily occurred in 2024, with Biden receiving a 34% approval rating in his final full month in office. The first half of 2025 was brutal for the Dems — and by some metrics, the bleeding still continues — but buoyed by November victories in Virginia, New Jersey, and New York City, the Dems are optimistic about the 2026 midterms.\n\nSo here’s the telltale sign of what to look for: A dramatic fall from grace — with someone’s reputation flipping from an asset to a liability. Before, their PR brand enhanced their status. Their name preceded them, opening doors and elevating their standing. It had a halo effect.\n\nNow it’s an anchor dragging them down.\n\nBefore we reveal the top (bottom?) three, here are the honorable mentions:\n\nGov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.) — On Jan. 1, 2025, Gov. Walz was on the shortlist of Democratic 2028 presidential frontrunners. And for the first few months that followed, his star glowed even brighter: As the Dems fretted over the loss of the white male vote, Walz seemed like the perfect compromise. (Technically a white man, but effeminate/nonthreatening enough to “pass.”) But his days as “America’s coach” are over: After the extent of the Somali fraud epidemic was revealed, Walz went from a presidential frontrunner to the single most scandal-scarred governor in the nation. Forget about the White House; he’ll have to scratch and claw to survive reelection.\n\nHis political career is now hanging by a string, which — if you know Walz’s nickname — is entirely appropriate.\n\nThe Trans Movement — Had it followed sane PR advice, it would’ve pursued the middle ground and consolidated its gains during the #MeToo and/or anti-patriarchy uproar of the 2010s: acceptance, compassion, and legal protections for trans adults. Instead, it focused on children, championing puberty blockers (with or without parents’ permission); deplatforming Americans from social media platforms for using the “wrong” pronouns; allowing biological men into girls’ bathrooms; awarding championship medals to biological men in women’s sports; and declaring that all gender differences were a social construct. It greedily overreached, and it triggered a backlash that still hasn’t subsided. \n\nBefore Donald Trump’s win in 2024, the pro-trans movement was led by a fierce army of digital activists, capable of banning “offenders” from YouTube, Instagram, or Twitter, deplatforming and demonetizing their ideological enemies. Posting scientific facts about gender distinctions could literally get you fired! Their threats were backed with action.\n\nIt got to the point where naïve kids would wonder if they were bigots or transphobic because they (gasp!) didn’t want to date a “girl” who has a penis.\n\nAfter Trump’s win, the trans movement was neutered (so to speak): The pronoun police were depowered, J.K. Rowling delivered a spellbinding rebuke to her witchy critics, Trump issued an executive order that banned biological men from women’s sports, and Penn swimmer Lia Thomas even had his/her swimming records erased. \n\nAlmost overnight, the trans movement collapsed.\n\nEven the Democrats have abandoned the trans movement, dismissing it as a distraction, focusing instead on the so-called “affordability crisis.” No other U.S.-based political movement lost more net ground in 2025.\n\nIran — It began the year as a regional superpower in the Middle East, always ready to rattle its saber, unleash its terrorist proxies, and complete its nuclear weapons program. At a moment’s notice, it could wreck the global petro market, torpedoing the economies of Europe, Asia, and North America.\n\nIt ended the year with large craters on the ground, a nuclear program under rubble, dead allies, a moribund economy, and not enough water for its people to drink.\n\nIn a region where reputation and “saving face” is all-important, Iran was utterly humiliated on the global stage, with Israel and America playing Whack-a-Mole from the sky, obliterating Iranian military sites with impunity. Never before had Iran’s Mullahs looked so pathetic and impotent. \n\nIt went from “Death to America” to “Wow, we have lots of new holes everywhere.”\n\nWhen a regime projects power to survive, weakness is an existential threat.\n\nAdditionally, a major taboo was broken: Bombing missions over Tehran's airspace have now been normalized. Despite the hysterics of pundits like Tucker Carlson, bombing Iran didn’t lead to World War III. Thousands of Americans — and millions of people — didn’t die. \n\nThe only things that died were the Iranian nuclear program and the Mullahs' credibility.\n\nIn retrospect, Carlson’s warning was juuuust a wee bit over the top:\n\nIran may not have nukes, but it has a fearsome arsenal of ballistic missiles, many of which are aimed at US military installations in the Gulf, as well as at our allies and at critical energy infrastructure. The first week of a war with Iran could easily kill thousands of Americans. It could also collapse our economy, as surging oil prices trigger unmanageable inflation. Consider the effects of $30 gasoline. But the second week of the war could be even worse. Iran isn’t Iraq or Libya, or even North Korea. While it’s often described as a rogue state, Iran has powerful allies. It’s now part of a global bloc called BRICS, which represents the majority of the world’s landmass, population, economy and military power. Iran has extensive military ties with Russia. It sells the overwhelming majority of its oil exports to China. Iran isn’t alone. An attack on Iran could very easily become a world war. We’d lose.\n\nFor Iran, 2025 was as bad as a Tucker Carlson prediction.\n\nSorry, fellas. Better luck to Tim Walz, the trans movement, and Iran in 2026. Work a little harder, guys, and you can make next year’s big list! (I believe in you.)\n\nNow, without any further ado, here are the three biggest PR losers of the year:\n\nThird Place: Elon Musk — When you contrast Musk’s actions against the viciousness of his detractors, it’s stunning. He literally gets worse press — and exponentially more hate — than killers like Luigi Magione. The gap between the man and his reputation (brand) is extraordinary.\n\nIt’s probably the most lopsided in modern PR history. \n\nHe revolutionized digital payments, built the electric car industry, saved the U.S. space program, spent billions to protect free speech, and helped create the A.I. boom by cofounding OpenAI, and now he has one of the most toxic brands in all of politics. At this point, an endorsement from Musk would do more harm than good.\n\nIt certainly hurt the Republicans in Wisconsin. One of the turning points in the GOP’s ill-fated state supreme court race was when the Dems pivoted to attacking Musk, making him the centerpiece of their campaign.\n\nIn Nov. 2024, Trump narrowly won Wisconsin. By April 2025, with Musk personally leading the charge on the campaign trail, the Republicans lost by 10 points.\n\nMusk annoyed much of the left when he campaigned for Trump in 2024. But 2025 was the year its hatred kicked into overdrive, because Musk got his hands on their precious government under the auspices of DOGE. \n\nSuddenly, liberals were accusing Musk of murdering the poor, plundering the treasury, and stealing national secrets. The world’s richest man was trying his damnedest to save the taxpayers money, working around-the-clock (for free!) with his DOGE team, and the Dems treated him like he was Satan incarnate. Other than Trump himself, no one was attacked as cruelly or as personally. \n\nVirtually every single Tesla dealership had to deal with mobs of leftwing protestors. Vandals were literally setting fire to his cars! Dopey celebs were dumping their Teslas over “white supremacy,” replacing them with... Volkswagens?\n\nThe irony was unreal.\n\n(Of course, Musk’s so-called “Nazi salute” on Jan. 20, 2025, didn’t help either.)\n\nBut conservatives still had his back until June 5. That’s when Musk’s displeasure with Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” led to an X tirade that culminated with the taunt: \n\nTime to drop the really big bomb:@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.Have a nice day, DJT!\n\nAnd just like that, the guy who spent $270 million to help get Trump elected was persona non grata from the White House.\n\nTowards the end of 2025, Musk’s chilly relationship with the White House began to thaw. Instead of following through with his threat to launch a third party, he’s signaled a willingness to fund GOP candidates in the 2026 midterms. And that’s very good news for both the GOP and Musk’s reputation: Even the world’s richest man needs someone to have his back.\n\nStill, for Musk’s brand, 2025 was a killer. Mostly via self-inflicted wounds, he greatly diminished himself.\n\nSecond Place: Israel — What it lost in PR it won in spades on the battlefield: By the time 2025 came to a close, Israel was safer, its enemies weaker, and its status in the Middle East at an all-time high.\n\nBut everywhere else, Israel’s reputation took a pounding. From Europe through America and across the planet, it was one PR misstep after another. Israel is now one of the most hated countries in the Western world. \n\nWearing a yarmulke, the Star of David, or pro-Israel attire could get you hospitalized, arrested, or killed.\n\nIt’s ironic: For all the stereotypes about Jews running Hollywood and controlling the media, the truth is that Israel is astonishingly daft at PR. (Shortly before his death, Charlie Kirk wrote an outstanding analysis of Israel’s PR woes. Prime Minister Netanyahu would be wise to heed Kirk’s advice.) \n\nWe’ve reached the point where Vladimir Putin of Russia, Xi Jinping of China, Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, and Seyyed Ali Khamenei of Iran could be walking down the street in liberal America, and leftists would rush past them to throw eggs at Benjamin Netanyahu. Today’s liberals don’t simply oppose Israel’s policies — they have a frothing, visceral hatred for the Jewish state. \n\nAccording to the left, Israel is genocidal and thus the spiritual heirs of the Nazis.\n\nIn all the Western world, Israel has only one ally left: the Republican Party. (And some MAGA-aligned influencers are working feverishly to change that.)\n\nBut so far, not only is it not working, but the opposite is true: Republican support for Israel actually grew in 2025. As Gallup reported, GOP support for Israel’s war in Gaza increased by 5 points between Sept. 2024 and July 2025, rising from 66% to 71%. And earlier this month, 86.7% of Turning Point USA attendees named Israel an American ally, with 1 in 3 crowning it America’s “top ally.”\n\nThis is a Godsend for Israel, because the Republican Party is its last friend in the West.\n\nMeanwhile, you know who had an excellent year in PR? Saidi Arabia, Sunni billionaires, and Qatar. Not only are they hosting comedy concerts, promoting sports, and enticing new homebuyers, they’ve even “encouraged” some of America’s top influencers to deny the danger of radical Islam, insisting that the real enemy is Israel.\n\nNo matter how hard the GOP tries to make “radical Islam” happen, the base doesn’t care about it.We are way more concerned about Israel.You can deny reality and scream about Tucker, but the party can no longer be governed by those who refuse to acknowledge the Zionist…— Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) December 27, 2025\n\nYessir, whoever Qatar and Saudi Arabia have been paying for PR help has done a helluva job. \n\n(Whomever THAT might be. ‘Cause I don’t know for a fact that Carlson or Owens pocketed millions in Sunni money; I’m just asking questions.)\n\nFirst Place: Attorney General Pam Bondi — She began the year red-hot, as the most battle-tested, boots-on-the-ground, take-no-prisoners member of the Trump cabinet. For eight long years, Pam Bondi was the attorney general of Florida, one of America’s most populous states. (And if you know anything about Florida Man, you know that ain’t a dull job.)\n\nUnlike someone like, say, Pete Hegseth, Bondi had a minimal learning curve: She should’ve known what she was doing from the get-go. We fully expected her to hit the ground running — and start collecting legal victories ASAP.\n\nInstead, she ran straight into the ground.\n\nAnd now she’s the least popular member of Trump’s cabinet. (By a landslide, too.) According to some metrics, her approval rating dropped by nearly 50 points!\n\nMusk’s X post didn’t help, but it was Bondi’s bungling of the Epstein investigation that pushed the story onto the front page of newspapers across the country. She overpromised, underdelivered, and elevated the Epstein sideshow into the main event. It was a textbook PR example of what not to do.\n\nNo member of Trump’s cabinet has been responsible for more negative press.\n\nAnd unfortunately, lots of her bad press is deserved. Not just the Epstein saga, but there’s been embarrassing setbacks in multiple high-profile cases: Leita James, James Comey — even with the failed indictment of a sandwich-chucker!\n\n(There’s an old legal joke that a grand jury would indict a ham sandwich. Maybe so, but the Bondi Justice Department is too incompetent to indict the guy who throws it.)\n\nWhen 2025 began, Bondi had it all: She’s beautiful, poised, photogenic, and confident. Of all the members of Trump’s cabinet, she was the most likely to be a breakthrough star. With her looks, brains, experience, and platform, she could’ve been a role model for American women — and the perfect GOP clapback to the DEI hires of the Dems, i.e., Joe Biden choosing Kamala Harris simply because he pledged to pick a woman: Unlike them, we choose the person who’s the best for the job.\n\nThe Republican Party is the party of merit, competency, and high standards!\n\nBut you can’t make a competency argument for an incompetent person. Bondi’s actions killed that storyline.\n\nIf she were scoring victories while eating bad press, that would be one thing. But she’s getting bad press while eating loss after loss. By a considerable margin, she’s the biggest PR loser of 2025. \n\nWhat an unbelievable disappointment.\n\nIt’s time for her to go.\n\nOne Last Thing: The PJ Media YUUUGE Christmas/New Year sale is here — offering readers a whopping 74% discount(!) with the code MERRY74.

Consider this your one-stop shop for news to kickstart your day. \n\nTOP O' THE MORNIN'\n\nRed-Hot at RedState \n\nWalz's damage-control effort appears increasingly desperate. But unless and until investigations yield some accountability in the governor's office, there is no reason to think he won't survive the fraud debacle. \n\nThat said, no doubt there are many who remain unconvinced that Cole is the culprit, and that's certainly understandable. This investigation was left to moulder, and the lack of information surrounding the incident for years allowed all manner of speculation to build. That, combined with the Biden DOJ's fervor directed at anyone in the vicinity of the Capitol on January 6th, has probably ensured that, for many, the questions will never be resolved. \n\nI suspect that in those states and areas where the Democrats have the political edge, including possibly Maine, the Trump is the devil campaign will be enough. But not in the more competitive states/areas. And those are where the 2026 mid-term elections will be decided.\n\nTrending Across Townhall Media\n\nPlease, be stupid somewhere more private than the pages of a large publication.\n\nI look forward to finding out if anybody goes to jail for criticisms of this outrageously stupid decision. \n\nFrom what I could tell about her, Anita is a hard worker. She's also brave. She calls out her \"government\" on a public platform when doing such a thing can land you in prison.\n\nAnd yes, the reason why most haven’t heard about it is that the liberal media did a full-court press in trying to suffocate the story.\n\nMainstream media? Covering an actual story that could hurt not only one Democrat but the Democratic Party and the state government of Minnesota itself? Never. Besides, they're far too busy crying that Trump's name is on the Kennedy Center.\n\nWHAT'S ON TAP?\n\nToday on Capitol Hill...\n\nThings are (and will be) quiet this week on the Hill as the critters enjoy their holiday break. But they'll be back next week (starting January 6), and they'll be busy. In fact, we spoke with Republican Congressman Bob Onder (MO-03) on Monday morning to get his take on the highlights of 2025 and what we can look forward to in 2026. I'll share that clip here as soon as it's available. \n\nUpdate: It's cued up here: \n\nWhite House What's Up\n\nOn Sunday, President Trump, who's at Mar-a-Lago for the holidays, held a lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and then met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as efforts to reach a peace agreement proceed. \n\nREAD MORE: 'Final Stages': Trump Meets With Zelensky to End War, Spars With the Media\n\nIn Presser With Zelensky, Trump Reveals the One Issue That's Holding Up a Russia-Ukraine Peace Deal\n\nOn Monday, he's set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at 1:00 PM Eastern. \n\nKeeping Up With the Cabinet\n\nSec. Health & Human Services - Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — Kennedy affirmed HHS support for hospitals in Washington, declaring a public health emergency following significant flooding in the state. \n\nFull Court Press...\n\nThe courts, as you might expect, were quiet over the holidays, but not completely quiet. There was Tennessee District Court Judge Waverly Crenshaw, who decided to put the criminal trial of St. Kilmar of Salvador on hold while he determines whether or not Abrego Garcia's prosecution for human smuggling is vindictive. \n\nREAD MORE: Of Course: Another Obama Judge Steps in to Save Illegal ‘Maryland Man’ As Human Smuggling Trial Is Axed\n\nThere was also an interesting filing by the DOJ in the prosecution of Brian Cole, who's accused of planting the pipe bombs outside the RNC and DNC that were discovered on January 6 (2021). So now we know a little more about his motive. \n\nMORNING MUSING\n\nIndependent journalist/YouTuber Nick Shirley may not be the first journalist to cover the Minnesota fraud story, but his coverage of it has certainly gone the most viral. I suspect that's due in no small part to the fact that he didn't just write about it but actually went directly to the source(s) of some of the fraud and provided us with stunning visual evidence of the daycare racket — which is, itself, just a fraction of the fraud — in a very easy-to-digest form. \n\nWe've heard rumblings of the issues for quite some time — the Feeding Our Future scandal was already a thing when Minnesota Governor Tim Walz was selected as then-Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate for the 2024 presidential election. But it was largely waved away as having nothing to do with him directly. At some point, though, he's not going to be able sidestep the accountability. This mess is too big. And people are rightfully angry as they learn just how badly their hard-earned tax dollars have been squandered. \n\nThis is serious stuff, but I have to acknowledge — the memes are going to be lit. \n\nLIGHTER FARE \n\nSweet babies!\n\nEnjoying the \"Morning Minute\"?

Or Is It Just Beginning?","text":"Halfway through the 119th Congress, it’s time to take a look at Republican leadership’s report card.\n\nWith razor-thin majorities in both Houses, Republicans have succeeded in extending President Donald Trump’s tax cuts and defunding public broadcasting and foreign aid. \n\nBut there are storm clouds on the horizon. Democrats are looking to take back the lower chamber in the 2026 midterms, while Republicans are engaged in a health care policy push, the fate of which is very uncertain.\n\nWith the new year upon us, it’s worth looking back at the moments when Republicans have triumphed and struggled in getting results out their unwieldy coalition.\n\nJohnson’s Reelection Bid\n\nThe first item on the agenda for Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., was getting reelected as the chamber’s top-ranking member in January.\n\nJust as the gavel was difficult to come by when former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted in 2023, it was difficult to maintain.\n\nIn the first round of votes, Republican Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Keith Self of Texas, and Ralph Norman of South Carolina all cast their votes against Johnson, while Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, defiantly abstained from voting.\n\nEventually, after communication with the White House and with Johnson, enough holdouts agreed to elect him, but with the understanding that he would commit to fiscal conservatism.\n\nAfter Johnson was reelected, fiscal hawks made clear they expected an aggressively conservative approach from Johnson throughout the Congress. \n\n“I think we had some reservations that are sincere, based on the speaker’s past 15 months as the speaker,” Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., told The Daily Signal in a phone interview at the time. “But we have steadfast support of the president and his timely certification, and so we don’t want to imperil that. And so, it’s a balance. But we also wanted to send a signal that business as usual around here is not going to stand.” \n\nHe added, “The speaker is on notice that if he’s going to continue to lead like he has over the last 15 months, it’s not going to end well,” he continued.\n\nThe ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’\n\nThe “Big, Beautiful Bill” stands as the most important piece of legislation passed in the 119th Congress thus far.\n\nThe first few months of President Donald Trump’s new administration were consumed by feverish debates over a budget reconciliation bill that would extend and expand on Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, put work requirements into the Medicaid program, and reverse much of President Joe Biden’s green energy policies, and fund mass deportation efforts.\n\nThe bill started out in the House, where for months leadership faced pressure from various camps within their narrow majority. The benefit of a budget reconciliation bill is its immunity to the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster threshold, allowing leadership to focus solely on acquiring Republican votes.\n\nOn the one hand, there was the SALT faction. These blue-state Republicans demanded an increase to the cap on state and local tax deductions for their constituents, which allow Americans to deduct their local taxes on their federal tax returns.\n\nThe SALT faction emerged with a win, as the bill boosted its deduction cap up to $40,000 a year, up from $10,000 in 2024.\n\nThen there was the House Freedom Caucus, which exerted pressure on the speaker every step of the way. From the beginning, they made their demands clear: matching new tax cuts to spending cuts to make up for potential revenue losses, ending the subsidization of green energy, and cost-saving reforms of Medicaid.\n\nThe House was able to perform a balancing act between these and other factions, sending the bill to the Senate before Memorial Day.\n\nIn the Senate, leadership had a shorter time frame for turning the bill around. Surprisingly, the Senate included new conservative health care provisions, such as capping the health care provider tax—a tool used by states to extract more federal funds.\n\nAdditionally, the Senate expanded on the House’s tax cuts, making some conservatives in the House nervous about a departure from the House’s insistence on matching tax cuts with spending cuts. \n\nOn the other hand, the Senate aggressively cut out green energy tax incentives in the big, beautiful bill.\n\nUltimately, there were winners and losers in the Senate. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., voted against it due to the provider tax cap, and subsequently announced he would not be seeking another term when Trump threatened a primary challenge.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., also voted against it due to complaints over its increase to the debt ceiling, and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, voted nay due to its entitlement reforms.\n\nOthers emerged with wins that ensured it passage, such as Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who voted for the bill after a number of Alaska-related provisions were included, such as a tax deduction for Alaskan whaling captains. \n\nAt the end, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., succeeded in getting it across the finish line when Vice President JD Vance’s tie-breaking vote allowed it to pass by a 51-50 margin.\n\nThe bill then made it over to the House, where, despite significant changes in the Senate that made both moderates and hardliners uneasy, it finally passed on July 3 and was signed into law on Independence Day, July 4.\n\nThe Shutdown\n\nThis Congress made history for the wrong reasons this year, too.\n\nDemocrat demands over health care for illegal aliens and an extension of President Joe Biden’s COVID-19-era increases to premium tax credit levels resulted in the longest federal government shutdown ever.\n\nThe shutdown spanned 43 days from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12.\n\n Republicans, under the leadership of Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., refused to the very end, arguing the subsidies are inflationary, prone to fraud, and prop up a broken system.\n\nWhat ensued was weeks of repeated voting on a government funding stopgap mechanism.\n\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., compared the ordeal to the movie “Groundhog Day,” as Republicans continued to put funding bills on the Senate floor and Democrats continued to reject them.\n\nThere were many unusual things about this shutdown, though. For one, Johnson decided to keep the House out of session up until the end. \n\nAdditionally, Trump’s trolling of Democrats went into overdrive with the president posting artificial intelligence-generated videos of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both D-N.Y., in sombreros demanding health care benefits for illegal immigrants.\n\nThe shutdown eventually came to an end when a coalition of Democrats agreed to pass a funding package consisting of a clean funding extension combined with a package of appropriations bills and a promise of a vote on extending the premium tax credits. \n\nIt was soon thereafter passed by the House and sent to the president, ending a shutdown which strained every part of the federal government.\n\nAn Inconclusive Finish\n\nIt is an awkward moment for Republicans at the halfway point in this Congress, and especially in the House.\n\nAlthough Democrats eventually gave in to Republicans in the shutdown battle, they did succeed in turning the Capitol’s focus towards the issue of the expiration of premium tax credits.\n\nTherefore, it is still an open question who won the messaging battle during the shutdown given the health care emphasis has triggered both parties to propose health care cost solutions to close out the year.\n\nDemocrats are seldom confronted with the fact that they voted twice—without any Republican support—to have the current health care premium credits expire.\n\nBut Republicans still need to get a premium-slashing piece of health care legislation to the president’s desk. On Dec. 17, the House passed a health care package by a vote of 216 to 211 that could lower premiums by more than 10%.\n\nThere are potential signs of unease ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nHaving been consigned to a background role for the first half of the year, Democrats priorities have now retaken the Capitol Hill spotlight—namely, government subsidized health care.\n\nWhat’s more, House GOP members have started to regularly go behind Johnson’s back to sign on to discharge petitions—a mechanism used to bypass leadership and force consideration of a bill. \n\nMultiple bills have already passed the House after being advanced by petition—a bill to compel the release of files on the now-deceased convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and another restoring federal workers’ union rights.\n\nOn the Wednesday before Christmas break, a group of moderate Republicans signed on to a petition backed by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., which will force a vote on a three-year extension of the enhanced premium tax credits.\n\nIn some ways, the House is operating as one would expect it to with such narrow margins. The Republican party is an ideologically diverse coalition, yet leadership has done a relatively effective job of calming intraparty drama up to this point.\n\nThere have also been high-profile announcements of retirements in the House. \n\nThe most prominent was Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., once one of Trump’s favorite House members before an ugly falling out. Greene will resign her seat on Jan. 5, 2026.\n\nMidterm Madness\n\nHeading into 2026, expect affordability to be the top concern on Capitol Hill leading up to the 2026 midterms.\n\nOn Dec. 17, Trump spoke directly to the American people in a televised speech from the White House, in which he touted the Republicans’ success in slowing inflation, as well as securing the border.\n\nThe speech followed rallies held by both Trump and Vance in important Pennsylvania swing districts.\n\nWhat comes next is a mystery, but historically, the party in the White House suffers in the midterms.\n\nHowever, there is no clear indication Democrats have mended the fractures in their coalition that were exposed in 2024—which saw Hispanic and Middle Eastern voters shift to the Republican Party, as well as dismal turnout for Democrats from black voters. \n\nDemocrats also saw their positions on immigration and transgenderism thoroughly rejected in 2024, while narratives on abortion access and Trump as a threat to democracy did not yield results.\n\nAdditionally, the House map includes many more Democrat-represented districts won by Trump than Republican-represented districts won by Kamala Harris. \n\nRepublicans also have a Senate pickup opportunity in Michigan, where former Rep. Mike Rogers narrowly lost in 2024, as well as in Georgia, where they hope to unseat Democrat Sen. Jon Ossoff. There are also very real Democrat pickup opportunities in Maine and North Carolina.\n\nThe onus is now on Republicans in Congress to pass popular legislation and effectively counter Democrat messaging. \n\nShould they fail and lose control of one chamber in Congress, the results are predictable: impeachment efforts, congressional investigations of the administration, and an inability to advance conservative legislation.\n\nElizabeth Troutman Mitchell contributed reporting.","summary":"Halfway through the 119th Congress, it&#8217;s time to take a look at Republican leadership&#8217;s report card.

Iowa Democrats broke the GOP’s lock on the chamber in an August special election. In Iowa, a two-thirds supermajority is required to override a governor’s veto, call for special sessions, authorize certain payments and confirm some gubernatorial appointees, according to the Iowa Secretary of the Senate. Republicans already hold a supermajority in the Iowa state House.\n\nIowa’s 16th state Senate district includes West Des Moines, Windsor Heights and Clive in the southwest corner of Polk County, as well as one precinct in eastern Dallas County.\n\nCelsi was reelected to a third term in 2024 with 69% of the vote. In the presidential race, Democrat Kamala Harris received about 58% of the District 16 vote.

From a giant merger, a controversial settlement, a canceled late-night show to overhauling CBS News, Paramount had a roller coaster year that lasted right up to the end of 2025. Here is a look back at Paramount's tumultuous journey: The Prologue In the days leading up to the 2024 presidential election, CBS News aired its \"60 Minutes\" interview featuring then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Critics at the time noticed that an answer she gave to a question about Israel that first aired in a preview clip on \"Face the Nation,\" which was mocked by conservatives for her \"word salad\" comments, appeared to have been swapped with a different answer that aired during the primetime election special the next evening. CBS ‘60 MINUTES’ AIRS TWO DIFFERENT ANSWERS FROM VP HARRIS TO THE SAME QUESTION Donald Trump, who at the time was the GOP nominee and only a former president, filed a multibillion-dollar lawsuit against CBS News and its parent company Paramount Global, alleging \"election interference\" with \"deceptive editing.\" CBS News and Paramount insisted the Harris interview followed editorial standards and stood by what aired. While liberals widely viewed Trump's lawsuit as frivolous and as something that would crumble under legal scrutiny, the entire dynamic completely flipped when he defeated Harris in the election just days later. Earlier in the year, Paramount announced its plans to merge with Skydance Media, run by David Ellison, the son of billionaire Oracle founder and Trump ally Larry Ellison. TRUMP CLAIMS CBS, ‘60 MINUTES’ HAVE TREATED HIM ‘FAR WORSE’ UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP However, the proposed $8 billion merger would ultimately need to seek the approval of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which Trump could sway in his favor once he returns to office. In other words, if Paramount aggressively fought Trump's lawsuit, it risks the Skydance merger being blocked by the incoming Trump administration. Settling Trump's lawsuit became a real possibility for Paramount and CBS News, coming on the heels of ABC News' $15 million settlement in December after Trump accused George Stephanopoulos of defamation for a segment. The Turmoil After Trump was sworn back into office, he appointed Brendan Carr to be FCC chair. One of Carr's first major actions was demanding CBS News to hand over the raw transcript and footage from the Harris interview, something CBS News refused to do when the controversy first erupted in the run-up to the election. In February, the FCC released the transcript which showed that both sets of comments Harris made in the preview clip and in the primetime special came from the same answer — CBS News used the first half of her answer in the preview clip while the latter half aired on \"60 Minutes.\" This disputed Trump's repeated claims that CBS News aired two different answers from two entirely different questions. Still, he had no intention of withdrawing his lawsuit, which he upped from $10 billion to $20 billion. ‘60 MINUTES’ STAFF STAND BY KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S MAJOR PARAMOUNT LAWSUIT Meanwhile, internal strife had already begun plaguing the CBS newsroom as word got out to the press that Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder at the time, wanted to settle Trump's lawsuit in order to pave the way for the Skydance merger, resulting in a huge payout for her. While she recused herself from the decision-making, Redstone had reportedly put \"60 Minutes\" under a microscope by keeping tabs on what upcoming segments were about Trump and his administration. That led to the resignation of \"60 Minutes\" executive producer Bill Owens, who told his colleagues in April that the corporate overreach impacted his ability to maintain an independent newsroom. CBS News President Wendy Mahon was also pushed out less than a month later. The dramatic exits of well-respected bosses and the looming prospect of a Trump settlement drowned the CBS newsroom in consternation. The Settlement In July, after months of contentious mediation, Paramount and CBS settled Trump's lawsuit for a sum expected to be north of $30 million, including $16 million upfront for Trump's presidential library. A source familiar with Paramount’s Redstone-era leadership told Fox News Digital that only the initial $16 million was sanctioned by the official mediator, and they had no knowledge of any deal Trump made with incoming ownership. Trump confirmed on Truth Social this week that he expects another $20 million from the new owners to be allocated for advertisements and public service announcements to promote conservative causes. CBS News issued no apology as part of the settlement, but the network did update its editorial policies that now require the release of raw transcripts of interviews with presidential candidates going forward. Despite the outcry from her critics, Redstone stood by the settlement, calling it a \"no-brainer.\" CBS STAFFERS REVOLT OVER PARAMOUNT'S ‘SHAMEFUL’ TRUMP SETTLEMENT, ‘BETRAYAL’ TO THE NETWORK'S JOURNALISTS The Cancellation While liberal critics blasted Paramount for allegedly \"bending the knee\" to Trump, the outrage reached new heights when, just days later, CBS announced that it was canceling \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" sending shock waves throughout the industry. Colbert's allies in the liberal media accused Paramount of pulling the plug on \"The Late Show\" as a decision directly tied to Trump's settlement and the merger, something Democratic lawmakers vowed to investigate. It even sparked an uproar within Paramount. \"The Daily Show\" host Jon Stewart — who at the time may have also been on the chopping block at Paramount-owned Comedy Central, but has since gotten a one-year extension — went after his corporate bosses over the cancellation, as did \"South Park,\" which dedicated the entire back-to-back seasons ridiculing Trump — depicting him as a Saddam Hussein-like authoritarian with small genitalia and in a romantic relationship with Satan — as well as several members of his administration. COLBERT SAYS PARAMOUNT'S $108 BILLION BID FOR WARNER BROS IS PROOF THEY COULD SAVE HIS SHOW IF THEY WANTED TO Colbert himself routinely targeted his own bosses during his monologues even though the network is giving his show until May 2026 before it's officially pulled off the air. CBS maintained it was purely a financial decision. A report about the astronomical expenses of \"The Late Show\" backed that up, alleging it was losing more than $40 million a year for the network and that it had a budget of more than $100 million per season. Meanwhile, Colbert was allegedly making $15–20 million per year. Within days of Colbert's announced cancellation, the FCC approved the Paramount-Skydance merger. The Ellison Takeover In August, Ellison officially became the owner and CEO of Paramount, now formally referred to as \"Paramount, a Skydance company,\" and Redstone received a reported $2 billion buyout. Ellison hit the ground running in his first few months as the Paramount owner, with the appointment of Bari Weiss as CBS News' new editor-in-chief and acquiring her outlet The Free Press for $150 million. He also struck a $7 billion exclusive deal with UFC, as well as a four-year deal with the Duffer Brothers, the co-creators of Netflix's \"Stranger Things.\" Weiss, who reports directly to Ellison, has made some moves of her own. She tapped \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil to become the new face of \"CBS Evening News,\" pushing out its co-anchors John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois after the perpetual third-place newscast took a notable hit in viewership after Norah O'Donnell stepped down in January. She also poached ABC News correspondent Matt Gutman, the reporter who sparked outrage earlier this year for calling the text messages Charlie Kirk's accused assassin Tyler Robinson sent to his trans partner \"very touching.\" TONY DOKOUPIL BECOMES LATEST IN REVOLVING DOOR OF ANCHORS TASKED TO REVIVE ‘CBS EVENING NEWS’ There had been concerns among CBS News staffers about Ellison's appointment of Weiss, particularly whether the two of them would inject their ideological views into their reporting. Earlier this month, \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Scott Pelley said the long-running magazine show has yet to face any corporate interference by the new bosses. However, days later, there was upheaval in the newsroom after Weiss pulled a segment about the brutal El Salvador prison CECOT where illegal migrants in the U.S. were sent to just hours before it was set to air. Sharyn Alfonsi, the segment's correspondent, called it a \"political\" move, while Weiss suggested it wasn't \"fair\" since it did not include a response from the Trump administration. Ellison rocked Paramount and CBS with a massive round of layoffs in October, something he had signaled leading up to the company merger. He cut roughly 1,000 jobs, many of them impacting various departments at CBS News. There had also been reports that \"CBS Mornings\" host Gayle King could potentially be on the outs from the network next year. The Hostile Takeover While 2025 marked an eventful year for Paramount, the saga may continue into 2026 as Ellison recently launched a hostile bid to take over Warner Bros. Discovery for $108 after it was announced that Netflix was going to buy Warner Bros. for $83 billion. If successful, not only would he own two major Hollywood studios, he would also become the new owner of CNN, fueling questions about whether Weiss would oversee both CBS News and CNN going forward. So far, Trump himself has had a more agnostic approach to the bidding war despite his reported coziness with the Ellisons. He praised Netflix as a \"great company\" and called its CEO Ted Sarandos a \"fantastic man\" but expressed concern about its market share. CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS In fact, Trump has expressed frustration over the Ellison-owned Paramount. He blasted the company for its \"60 Minutes\" interview featuring ally-turned-foe Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., writing on Truth Social that the new ownership is \"NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP.\" He later claimed he's being treated \"far worse\" under the new ownership. He also called for CNN to be part of \"any deal\" with Warner Bros. Discovery, demanding that the network have completely new ownership. So, in the end, Paramount may once again be at the mercy of the Trump administration since it has the power to quash its financial prospects. Only time will tell.

Republican members of Congress","text":"The midterm elections for Congress won’t take place until November, but already a record number of members have declared their intention not to run – a total of 43 in the House, plus 10 senators. Perhaps the most high-profile person to depart, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, announced her intention in November not just to retire but to resign from Congress entirely on Jan. 5 – a full year before her term was set to expire.\n\nThere are political dynamics that explain this rush to the exits, including frustrations with gridlock and President Donald Trump’s lackluster approval ratings, which could hurt Republicans at the ballot box.\n\nRather than get swept away by a prospective “blue wave” favoring Democrats – or possibly daunted by the monumental effort it would take to survive – many Republicans have decided to fold up the beach chair and head home before the wave crashes.\n\nAs of now, two dozen Republican House members have either resigned from the House or announced their intent to not run for reelection in 2026. With only two exceptions – Republicans in 2018 and 2020 – this is more departures from either party at this point in the election calendar than any other cycle over the past 20 years.\n\nThere is also growing concern within the House Republican caucus that Greene’s announcement is a canary in the coal mine and that multiple resignations will follow.\n\nAs a political scientist who studies Congress and politicians’ reelection strategies, I’m not surprised to see many House members leaving ahead of what’s shaping up to be a difficult midterm for the GOP. Still, the sheer numbers of people not running tells us something about broader dissatisfaction with Washington.\n\nWhy do members leave Congress?\n\nMany planned departures are true retirements involving older and more experienced members.\n\nFor example, 78-year-old Democratic congressman Jerry Nadler is retiring after 34 years, following mounting pressure from upstart challengers and a growing consensus among Democrats that it’s time for older politicians to step aside. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker who will turn 86 in March, is also retiring.\n\nSometimes, members of Congress depart for the same reasons other workers might leave any job. Like many Americans, members of Congress might find something more attractive elsewhere. Retiring members are attractive hires for lobbying firms and corporations, thanks to their insider knowledge and connections within the institution. These firms usually offer much higher salaries than members are used to in Congress, which may explain why more than half of all living former members are lobbyists of some kind.\n\nOther members remain ambitious for elective office and decide to use their position in Congress as a springboard for another position. Members of the House regularly retire to run for a Senate seat, such as, in this cycle, Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan. Others run for executive offices, including governor, such as Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina.\n\nBut some are leaving Congress due to growing frustration with the job and an inability to get things done. Specifically, many retiring members cite growing dysfunction within their own party, or in Congress as a whole, as the reason they’re moving on.\n\nIn a statement announcing his departure in June, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., mused that “between spending another six years navigating the political theater and partisan gridlock in Washington or spending that time with my family,” it was “not a hard choice” to leave the Senate.\n\nWhat’s unique about 2026?\n\nIn addition, there are a few other factors that can help explain why so many Republicans in particular are heading for the exits leading up to 2026.\n\nThe shifting of boundaries that has come with the mid-decade redistricting process in several states this year has scrambled members’ priorities. Unfamiliar districts can drive incumbents to early retirement by severing their connection with well-established constituencies.\n\nIn Texas, six Republicans and three Democrats – nearly a quarter of the state’s entire House delegation – are either retiring or running for other offices, due in part to that state’s new gerrymander for 2026.\n\nAll decisions about retirement and reelection are sifted through the filter of electoral and partisan considerations. A phenomenon called “thermostatic politics” predicts that parties currently in power, particularly in the White House, tend to face a backlash from voters in the following election. In other words, the president’s party nearly always loses seats in midterms.\n\nIn 2006 and 2018, for example, Republican members of Congress were weighed down by the reputations of unpopular Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Trump. Republicans had arguably even greater success in midterm elections during Barack Obama’s presidency.\n\nCurrently, 2026 looks like it will present a poor national environment for Republicans. Trump remains highly unpopular, according to polls, and Democrats are opening up a consistent lead in the “generic ballot” question, which asks respondents which party they intend to support in the 2026 midterms without reference to individual candidates.\n\nDemocrats have already been overperforming in special elections, as well as the general election in November in states such as New Jersey and Virginia, which held elections for governor. Democrats are on average running 13 points ahead of Kamala Harris’ performance in the 2024 election.\n\nAs a result, even Republicans in districts thought to be safe for their party may see themselves in enough potential danger to abandon the fight in advance.\n\nRetirement vs. resignation\n\nOne final, unique aspect of this election cycle with major consequences is not an electoral but an institutional one.\n\nHouse conservatives are quietly revolting against Speaker Mike Johnson’s leadership style. That members may be frustrated enough not just to retire but resign in advance, leaving their seats temporarily vacant, is a notable sign of dysfunction in the U.S. House.\n\nThis also could have a major impact on policy, given how slim the Republicans’ majority in the lower chamber is already. Whatever the outcome of the midterms in November, these departures clearly matter in Washington and offer important signals about the chaos in Congress.\n\nCharlie Hunt, Associate Professor of Political Science, Boise State University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Mainstream Media Is Eating It Up.","text":"How many people will the Trump administration deport this year? Will Gaza suffer from mass famine? These are serious questions with lives at stake.\n\nThey’re also betting propositions that two buzzy startups will let you gamble on. \n\nThe 2018 legalization of sports betting gave rise to a host of apps making it ever easier to gamble on games. Kalshi and Polymarket offer that service, but also much more. They’ll take your bets, for instance, on the presidential and midterm elections, the next Israeli bombing campaign, or whether Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg will get divorced.\n\nTarek Mansour, the CEO of Kalshi, laid it out simply at a conference held by Citadel Securities in October. “The long-term vision,” Mansour said, “is to financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference in opinion.” It’s as dystopian as it sounds.\n\nIf you believe the hype, the promise of these companies isn’t in the money they take in as bookkeepers. They argue that the bets they collect offer a more accurate forecast of the future than traditional institutions. (In fact, they’ll tell you that you’re not betting at all but trading on futures contracts — a distinction that feels so tenuous it’s hard to justify with a full-throated explanation.)\n\nThis pitch has been especially enticing in the wake of the 2016 election, when polling missed the rise of Donald Trump, and its allure hasn’t faded as collective distrust of traditional institutions grows. But if the initial wave of social platforms — the Facebooks and Twitters of the world — fractured our sense of a shared reality, the predictive platforms are here to monetize the ruins.\n\nPolymarket acknowledges the gravity of some of its more shocking propositions. It tells those who click on its more unsavory wagers: “The promise of prediction markets is to harness the wisdom of the crowd to create accurate, unbiased forecasts for the most important events to society. That ability is particularly invaluable in gut-wrenching times like today.” The app goes on say that “After discussing with those directly affected by the attacks, who had dozens of questions, we realized prediction markets could give them the answers they needed in ways TV news and 𝕏 could not.”\n\nIt might seem odd, then, that these very platforms have lately been signing deals to entrench themselves into mainstream news coverage. Earlier this month, Kalshi signed on as an exclusive partner to offer its betting wagers on CNN and CNBC. Polymarket signed a similar deal with Yahoo Finance last month. Time Magazine signed with a lesser known platform Galactic.\n\nFor publishers, prediction markets offer a salve for deteriorating trust in journalism. For betting markets, these partnerships could help legitimize an industry that was mostly illegal until a few months ago. The marriage of these two industries is perhaps best encapsulated by Time Magazine’s recent press release announcing its partnership with Galactic. Stuart Stott, CEO of Galactic, called the deal “a new normal for readers” that promises them “the opportunity to participate in where the future is going.” Time Magazine COO Mark Howard described the partnership as motivated by the company’s “ambition to continue to push the boundaries of traditional media to ensure our content and audience experience is compelling, accurate, and evolving.”\n\nSet aside the extreme cynicism in the conceit that audiences need to bet on genocide in order to read about it — if accuracy and trust are a concern, these partnerships may end up doing the media more harm than good.\n\nTo understand why the prediction markets apps believe they’re a better forecaster of the future, one needs to understand their governing philosophy, the “wisdom of the crowd.” The theory goes: In a well-functioning market with a diverse group of participants, traders acting on different information and insights collectively arrive at the most accurate price — or, in this case, probability of an event happening. The market, in other words, will self-correct to the most accurate outcome.\n\nBetting apps have at times delivered better accuracy than polling results. For example, while pollsters clocked last year’s presidential race as deadlocked in the days before the election, Polymarket gave Trump an edge at 58 percent.\n\nBut whether they are consistently better is a whole other story. Some initial analysis suggests that they might not be as accurate as these companies suggest. One study found that Kalshi’s political prediction markets beat chance 78 percent of the time during the final five weeks of the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign, compared with 67 percent accuracy on Polymarket. PredicIt — one of the older betting markets run by Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, that has more limits on how much money users can bet — came out on top at 93 percent. But even PredicIt got the 2016 election as wrong as the polls, and in the days preceding the last election suggested a slight edge for Kamala Harris that obviously didn’t materialize.\n\nThat same study found that when tracking the market for the same event, prediction markets often reacted in very different ways to the same information during the same time frame — something that wouldn’t happen if the markets were as efficient forecasters as its pushers suggest. “Markets are composed of humans, not omniscient rational forecasters,” the paper’s authors write.\n\nOne reason why Kalshi or Polymarket may struggle with accuracy hinges on who makes up the crowd. On November 6, 2024, in a rush of people collecting their post-election winnings, Kalshi saw a peak of around 400,000 users, and Polymarket counted about 100,000 less, according to a Fortune review; by June, their daily active user numbers had fallen over 90 percent to 27,000–32,000 and 5,000–10,000, respectively. While they don’t publish much information about their demographics, by some accounts their userbases tend to skew in the direction of crypto bros.\n\nThat can make these platforms just as inaccurate in edge cases, when they lack the requisite diversity to glean much wisdom about the real world. Consider the 2022 midterm elections: Up until election night, the major prediction markets “failed spectacularly” and “projected outcomes for key races that turned out to be completely wrong,” according to one expert analysis.\n\nWhile polls are far from perfect, prediction markets are also more prone to manipulation than they’d have you believe. And this can give deep-pocketed political actors another vessel for information warfare. \n\nKalshi was even embroiled in a legal battle with federal regulators as recently as this summer for this very reason. In its brief, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission pointed toward a “spectacular manipulation” on Polymarket involving “a group of traders betting heavily on Vice President Harris.” “Unwitting participants may believe Kalshi’s contracts are less susceptible to manipulation or misinformation because they are on a regulated exchange, but this should heighten concern for the public interest, not allay it,” the CFTC continued.\n\nOne study found that trades intended to manipulate the market could have an impact as much as 60 days from the original trade. It also suggested the best way to game a prediction market was by making repeated bets of “varying sizes” on a single market to skew odds.\n\nAccording to the CFTC, when the agency brought up the possibility of this type of election interference, Kalshi argued the regulator could just use its enforcement authority against bad actors. But as the agency noted: “The CFTC cannot remediate damage to election integrity after the fact.” Despite these grave concerns, since Trump took office and has hired crypto insiders to oversee the CFTC, the agency has largely dropped lawsuits and investigations against Polymarket and Kalshi.\n\nThe major betting platforms have also aligned themselves with Trump’s inner orbit. \n\nBoth Polymarket and Kalshi count Donald Trump Jr. as an adviser. His venture capital firm has invested in Polymarket, whose founder Shayne Coplan has framed investigations against his company as politically motivated attacks by the outgoing Biden administration.\n\nOne doesn’t have to look far to see how the company’s positionality in the Trumpverse translated into what very well could be election interference. Shortly before election day in New York last month, Polymarket ran a questionable advertisement featuring an AI-generated Zohran Mamdani looking tearful with the headline: “BREAKING: Mamdani’s odds collapse in NYC Mayoral Election.” As this ad ran, however, Polymarket’s platform didn’t show Mamdani’s odds collapsing. Whether Polymarket intended to bait users into betting more, or to dissuade Mamdani voters ahead of Election Day, is unclear. What is clear is that for a platform partnering with a news organization, a commitment to veracity does not appear to be its first priority.\n\nThe first priority appears to be growing the number of customers. That’s likely why these betting apps are now trying to team up with major broadcasters and publications: Reporting shows that both Kalshi and Polymarket are losing bettors, which stands to hurt their bottom lines and make their predictions worse.\n\nWhether deals between betting apps and news outlets will help either industry is an open question. But these partnerships may just end up worsening our crisis of trust in an already-fraught information environment.","url":"https://theintercept.com/2025/12/29/polymarket-kalshi-betting-prediction-cnn-news-media/","image":"https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2237779133.jpg?fit=4000%2C2667","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 11:00:00","author":"Tekendra Parmar","authors":["Tekendra Parmar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":389840984,"title":"The Morning Briefing: Bells Are Jingling All the Wrong Way for Tim Walz","text":"Top O' the Briefing\n\nHappy Monday, dear Kruiser Morning Briefing friends. Herdlvescq kept an oversized jerkin on his pontoon boat for times that he felt lacked whimsy. \n\nI hope that everyone had a wonderful Christmas Day and a weekend full of leftovers. This year has been a wild one, hasn't it? We're going to have some fun this week getting ready for 2026. \n\nNot everybody is finishing the year on a strong note, however. Minnesota Gov. Tim \"¿Quién Es Más Macho?\" Walz is having a bit of a bumpy ride lately. The road doesn't appear to be getting any smoother for him either. \n\nThis is from Matt:\n\nGov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.) is already under fire for billions of dollars of fraud that have occurred on his watch, and if you thought things couldn’t get worse for him, you were wrong.A viral video showing a Minneapolis daycare that received millions in public funding has reignited questions about oversight failures during his tenure.The Quality Learning Center, licensed to care for up to 99 children, appears completely empty in footage that independent videographer Nick Shirley recorded. But that emptiness isn't even the most embarrassing part. The facility can't spell \"learning\" correctly on its own sign.\n\nOne of the things I find most odd about Walz is that he constantly seeks the spotlight, even though that spotlight hasn't been very friendly to him. Walz is one of those politicians who definitely doesn't grow on the public when they get to know him more. The public outside of his home state, that is. I don't know what's in the water in Minnesota that makes him so popular there. \n\nIt's indicative of how thin the Democratic bench is that they thought that Walz was a viable national candidate in 2024. I'm still convinced that the reason Kamala Harris chose him as a running mate was that he was the only option whom she could feel smarter than. She said that she just hit it off with him better than his rivals, probably because he seems dumb as a box of rocks.\n\nAt the beginning of the month, I wrote that Walz is one of the worst people I've seen rise to prominence in the Democratic Party in over four decades of activism. He's utterly clueless and continues to act as if he isn't mired in an ever-worsening scandal. Even more laughable is that Walz is under the impression that he should make a run for the Democratic nomination in 2028.\n\nI want some of whatever he's on. \n\nMy new-ish colleague and longtime friend Jennifer Rust wrote a post about the young journalist Nick Shirley, who is now applying pressure to Walz. His reach is staggering:\n\nThe New York Times, the \"paper of record,\" has reported on Minnesota's social services fraud, as has the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. However, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune has a digital weekday circulation of approximately 102,000, with print circulation of about 71,000. Per their third quarter earnings release, the New York Times reaches 11.76 million digital subscribers and about 570,000 print subscribers. The difference between the mainstream outlets' reach and Shirley's is phenomenal. Shirley's Dec. 26 post video has been seen on X over 92 million times as of this writing, with nearly a million more views on YouTube.\n\nWelcome to the New World Media Order. This is the kind of thing that has the faux journos in dinosaur media covered in flop sweat. The mainstream media's stranglehold on information control and narrative creation has been obliterated. Fifteen or twenty years ago, we might not have heard about this mess in Minnesota at all. \n\nAgain, Walz is near the top of the list of obnoxious Democrats I would like to see run out of office in disgrace. I am quite jaded when it comes to the lack of accountability in politics, but things aren't going well for Walz right now. Maybe those walls will finally close all the way in.\n\nContributions to the Mailbag of Magnificence can be sent to [email protected]\n\nClick the button to get the Morning Briefing emailed to you every weekday.

Ignore God’s words and you will not.”\n\nPS: So I read that “Die Hard” is not a Christmas movie. Next they will try to claim that “Terminator I” isn’t a love story! \n\nThank you, Gail. I hope your holidays are going well too. I stayed in Tucson for Christmas and am heading to see my mom this week. My daughter will be flying in from New York to join us. \n\nGeorge Washington's presidential speeches should get more attention than they do.

Maybe that'll be a new tradition!\n\nPaul in Indiana writes:\n\nLoved your article today! \n\nThe Left seems to believe there's \"dirt\" in the Epstein Files on President Trump. I realize it's their constant \"Get Trump\" campaign, however with Biden's handlers having complete and total access to all the files in 2024 any unlawful information on Trump would've been published before the election to upend his campaign. Their candidate, Kalamity Harris, was so bad the democrats would've stopped at nothing to get her elected. \n\nOh yeah, the Clinton's? Totally Teflon coated from head to toe. \n\nMerry Christmas and Happy New Year!\n\nI'm glad you enjoyed it! I'm honestly stunned that this drama still has legs. Other than the entertainment value of the \"Epstein didn't kill himself\" memes, I'm pretty bored by the whole thing. People all over the political spectrum think that someone they don't like is going to be ruined by the files.

But they are increasingly disagreeing with the president on issues like the economy and immigration, raising questions about the strength of his coalition heading into a midterm election year. That’s the upshot of a year of focus group conversations diving into different key groups of Trump’s 2024 base of support, which were observed by NBC News and produced by Syracuse University and the research firms Engagious and Sago. The groups included more than 50 Black, Hispanic and young voters who voted for Trump, as well as Trump voters who decided to back Democrats in this year’s New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial elections. Consistent themes emerged across those conversations with different groups of Trump voters in March, June, September and December. Few are fully off the Trump train, though a handful are. A larger group, though, have started raising concerns, primarily around what they see as a lack of follow-through on tackling inflation and the cost of living, which were key reasons they voted for Trump in 2024. An overlapping group also balked at the administration’s deportation policies. And while voters in the focus groups during the first half of 2025 were almost unanimous in approving of Trump’s job performance, albeit with some hesitations, the drumbeat of frustration has grown louder as the year draws to a close. \"Many of these voters gave President Trump a long runway well into the summer because they believed that he understands how business works better than they do and that his own fortune would eventually translate to enriching the country and their own finances or because they felt so strongly that unchecked immigration was a huge problem that needed a huge fix,\" said Margaret Talev, director of Syracuse University’s Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship. \"But as the year wore on, we have seen a shift among these voters collectively, cracks in their faith, more questioning, oscillating or outright change of heart about Trump,\" Talev continued. \"What we almost never see is a wish for a do-over vote or a rush toward Democrats for the answer. All about the economy Perspectives shifted across groups and across the course of the year, but a few major constants were clear. Trump supporters in these groups were divided from the start over the president’s use of tariffs — caught between the promise of an “America First” remaking of international economics and frustration with an erratic rollout and the effect the tariffs had on prices. Some voters expressed disappointment that the president hasn’t made tackling inflation a higher priority and wanted to see more tangible progress in his pledge to lower prices across the board — a thing that essentially never happens except in moments of economic calamity. But many are willing to give Trump grace, arguing that change takes time or that life would be worse under a Democratic president. Rozlyn C., a 44-year-old Georgia voter of Cuban descent, said that she disagreed with the president’s decision to impose tariffs on countries with which the U.S. did not have a trade deficit. But she was still broadly supportive of the president in the June focus group with swing-state Latino voters who backed Trump. “I think he has a grand master plan that most of us probably don’t understand,” she said, adding, “I have faith that he, a hundred percent, has the best interest of our country at heart.” Fewer than half of Trump voters across the four focus groups said they felt that Trump had made fighting inflation a top priority, though some were still willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt or said they were seeing signs things had improved. “I expected him to be aggressive in a lot of different areas and he’s doing exactly that — being aggressive in a lot of different areas of focus that concern the U.S. citizens. Every few days you’re hearing something different and you’re constantly seeing him at work, working, getting stuff done,” said 56-year-old independent Dorris S., who participated in the March group of swing-state Black Trump voters. But a number of others were less charitable on Trump’s inflation efforts, particularly toward the end of the year. Robert L., a 54-year-old Virginian who participated in a December group of Trump voters who backed a Democrat for governor in November elections, said that the president’s comments about inflation improving are “delusional” and prove he’s “out of touch.” Another participant in that same December panel, 39-year-old Virginian Justin K., said that he doesn’t think Trump “tried at all” to tackle inflation because he was focused on other things. “He’s been focused on prosecuting his political enemies, pardoning people,” he said. “I don’t even think that there’s much a president can do on inflation, but I think that this was a kind of situation where he just said it to get elected,” Justin continued. Rich Thau of Engagious, who moderated the sessions, told NBC News that from the focus groups, \"it’s clear President Trump’s greatest vulnerability is being viewed as ineffective and insulated when it comes to inflation—just like President Biden was.\" Tariffs divide theory versus practice Trump’s tariff policy also revealed an important divide, between those who were hopeful that a short stretch of instability would pay future dividends and others concerned about uncertainty or hurting businesses and consumers. “I think that it’s ridiculous that we haven’t been charging tariffs for decades and we’re starting to equalize it,” Hector L., a 55-year-old North Carolina voter who was born in Puerto Rico, said in June. “Other countries charge us particular tariffs for our goods; it’s only fair that we make it equal across the playing board — no imbalance, that’s been the problem. And he’s trying to bring balance, to the force, per se, of tariffs,” William A., a 60-year-old Georgia voter of Puerto Rican descent, said during the June panel. But David S., a 47-year-old New Jersey Trump voter who cast his ballot for Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mikie Sherrill last month, put it differently in December. “Tariffs are a tax on the American people. That’s who pays for it, so I don’t support it,” he said. “Every tariff that is put in place, from when Biden is putting ‘em in place, Trump putting them in place, they are taxes on the people who are importing. The people who are buying those imports are paying the tax.” Overall, some were optimistic about the economic outlook under Trump. And one of the things that brought out this sentiment most was considering a hypothetical under a Democratic administration. “I feel that if we were in the hands of Kamala Harris or Joe Biden, that our country would be doing a lot worse than it already was. I feel like Trump has amended some of those wrongs that were done,” Harmony D., a 26-year-old Michigander who identifies as an independent and voted for Trump twice, said in October. But others see Trump’s populist economic pitch falling short in practice. “It’s a bait and switch with him where he said he was for the average person but he actually favors big business, and then just does whatever he wants and there’s no consequences,” Virginia’s Justin K. said. High marks on immigration, but deportation concerns Immigration was a major piece of Trump’s promise during the 2024 campaign, and most Trump voters were supportive of his measures to clamp down on illegal border crossings. But the focus groups also highlighted significant criticisms of the administration’s deportation policies, with voters believing Trump wasn’t properly prioritizing the removal of violent criminals over the removal of undocumented immigrants who posed little public safety threat. Some Trump voters directly panned the deportation policies as inhumane. “When it comes to immigration, a lot of respondents told us this year, ‘I like what the President is doing, but I don’t like how he’s doing it.’ This suggests they’re struggling to reconcile their vote for the President with executive actions they find troubling,” said Rich Thau of Engagious. Rebecca H., a 52-year-old independent from Virginia, said in December that she approves of how Trump is \"tightening the border control\" and \"restricting the refugees.\" But she didn't like how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was \"kidnapping people,\" she said, as it makes arrests. Katelyn R., a 21-year-old Wisconsin independent who participated in the October focus group of young Trump voters, invoked “pro-life” values to question the morality of the deportation policies. “The way that these people are being treated don’t align with my Christian values, or my pro-life values, or any of the values that a conservative may have,” she said. And Ruby L., a 59-year-old Georgia voter who was born in Colombia and participated in the Hispanic focus group in June, questioned the administration’s priorities on the issue. “He was going to deport people that were criminals and have backgrounds,” she said. “But I see that he’s deporting people that work hard and have been in this country. I think he should find a way to help them stay and get citizenship or something.” Others were less forgiving of those in America illegally, arguing that they knew the risks when they or their families came to the country. “Well, what do you expect? If you came here illegally, you’ve done something illegal. Expect the consequences,” Justin O., a 38-year-old Nevadan who was born in the United States and is of Mexican descent, said during the June group.","summary":"The voters who put President Donald Trump back in the White House last year still largely support him.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/learned-state-trump-coalition-conversations-50-voters-year-rcna248275","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251209-trump-speech-lr-6a0648.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 10:00:00","author":"Ben Kamisar","authors":["Ben Kamisar"],"language":"en","source_country":"na","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":389785450,"title":"Tim Walz responds to Minnesota fraud scandal after Kash Patel says new claims of stolen taxpayer money 'just tip of the iceberg'","text":"Tim Walz addressed the ongoing fraud scandal in Minnesota after a viral video showed an empty daycare center with a misspelled sign that received millions in federal funding.\n\nThe Minnesota governor claimed he was taking strong action against the alleged fraud, just hours after FBI boss Kash Patel revealed the crisis runs far deeper than initially thought.\n\n'The governor has worked for years to crack down on fraud and ask the state legislature for more authority to take aggressive action,' a spokesperson for Walz told Fox News. \n\n'He has strengthened oversight - including launching investigations into these specific facilities, one of which was already closed.' \n\nWalz also 'hired an outside firm to audit payments to high-risk programs, shut down the Housing Stabilization Services program entirely, announced a new statewide program integrity director, and supported criminal prosecutions.' \n\nThe governor has been inundated with criticism from concerned Americans questioning how he intends to respond to allegations of widespread fraud within the state. \n\nInitial reports emerged earlier this month of a massive Covid-era scheme involving the federally funded nonprofit group Feeding Our Future.\n\nAt least 78 people, 72 of whom are Somali, have been charged in connection with the illicit plot. \n\nWalz, who ran as Vice President on the Democratic ticket alongside Kamala Harris in 2024, defended his state on Sunday on X and shared four photographs of him interacting with members of the Somali community. \n\nHe wrote about Minnesota: '#8 state for safety. #5 state to live in. #3 state for jobs. #2 state to raise a family, and #2 state to retire. \n\n'We've made progress, but there's more to do to deliver security, opportunity, and freedom to every Minnesotan. I won't quit fighting until we're #1.'\n\nHis post came after outrage over the alleged fraud grew on Friday when independent journalist Nick Shirley shared footage of an apparently empty Minnesota daycare, which reportedly received millions in taxpayer funds. \n\nFootage of the facility, featuring a misspelled sign as 'Quality Learing Center', sparked outrage among lawmakers and allegations state authorities allowed the 'largest fraud in US history' to go unchecked. \n\nIn response, FBI Director Kash Patel said the FBI has long been aware of fraud allegations in the state and threatened action against perpetrators.\n\n'The FBI believes this is just the tip of a very large iceberg,' Patel wrote. \n\n'We will continue to follow the money and protect children, and this investigation very much remains ongoing.' \n\n'Furthermore, many are also being referred to immigration officials for possible further denaturalization and deportation proceedings where eligible.'\n\nAddressing the allegations made in Shirley's video, Patel said the 'FBI is aware of recent social media reports in Minnesota.'\n\nHe claimed that the bureau has moving to 'dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs.'\n\n'Fraud that steals from taxpayers and robs vulnerable children will remain a top FBI priority in Minnesota and nationwide.\n\nAccording to Shirley, the childcare center pocketed $1.9 million from Minnesota's Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP) in 2025, bringing the total to $4 million. \n\nShirley, in his investigation, arrived at the doorsteps of several daycare centers, claiming to be a father looking to enroll his child, but said he never saw any children at the facilities.\n\nHe said it was 'potentially the largest fraud scandal in US history.' \n\nIn his announcement, Patel emphasized that the FBI has been aggressively targeting a massive fraud network that stole COVID-era food scheme.\n\n'The FBI has toppled a $250 million fraud network that targeted vulnerable children and exposed a 'large-scale money laundering' operation,' Patel said.\n\n'The investigation exposed sham vendors, shell companies and large-scale money laundering tied to the Feeding Our Future network,' he wrote. \n\n'The case led to 78 indictments and 57 convictions.'\n\nProsecutors alleged that most of the meals intended for low-income children during the pandemic never existed. Instead, the taxpayer's money went to luxury homes, cars, jewelry, and real estate abroad. \n\n'These criminals didn't just engage in historic fraud, but tried to subvert justice as well,' Patel wrote.\n\nPresident Donald Trump criticized Governor Tim Walz for allowing Minnesota to become 'a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.'\n\nHe said the perpetrators should be 'sent back to where they came from.'\n\nLater, he said he would be revoking the temporary protected status of the roughly 700 Somali nationals who have it, which prevents them from being deported. \n\nOn Thanksgiving, Trump called Walz 'seriously retarded' and also attacked Rep. Ilhan Omar and Minnesota's immigration policy.","summary":"Walz, who ran as Vice President on the Democrat ticket alongside Kamala Harris in 2024, has faced vocal criticism amid allegations of rampant fraud in his state.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15418181/Tim-Walz-Minnesota-fraud-scandal.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/29/06/105071399-0-image-m-2_1766990478308.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 09:20:45","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.453},{"id":389792166,"title":"The 2026 battleground: Congress’s most vulnerable House and Senate seats","text":"This list focuses exclusively on incumbents and does not take into account open-seat races. It also excludes California lawmakers following voter approval of Proposition 50, which locks in a Democrat-drawn congressional map for the next three election cycles.\n\nHouse battlegrounds\n\nRep. Gabe Evans (R-CO), 8th District \n\nFreshman Rep. Gabe Evans (R-CO) is shaping up to be one of Democrats’ top pickup targets in 2026 as they look to claw back ground in Colorado’s most competitive congressional district.\n\nA former police officer, Evans represents a fast-growing district north of Denver that has become increasingly diverse and politically volatile. The seat features a large Latino population and has swung narrowly in recent cycles, placing it firmly on both parties’ shortlists.\n\nDemocrats are eager to challenge Evans but face an unsettled primary that could complicate their path. Former Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo, who previously represented the district, has entered the race, as has Democratic state Rep. Manny Rutinel. Additional candidates are still being discussed, raising the possibility of a crowded and possibly divisive nomination fight.\n\nEvans entered October with close to $2 million on hand, dwarfing the cash reserves of every other Democrat in the field.\n\nAll three candidates have emphasized their Hispanic heritage, a central factor in a district where Latino voters are expected to play an outsize role in determining the outcome.\n\nRepublicans view Evans as a strong fit for the district’s law-and-order electorate, while Democrats see the seat as one of their clearest opportunities to flip a suburban district amid shifting coalitions and a high-stakes presidential midterm environment.\n\nRep. Vicente Gonzales (D-TX), 34th District\n\nRep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-TX) enters the 2026 cycle as one of the few Democrats still holding a South Texas seat that has rapidly shifted right. His border district, which is majority Latino, moved more than 15 points toward President Donald Trump in 2024, and Texas Republicans subsequently redrew the map to further strengthen GOP prospects there. Even so, Gonzalez has made clear he plans to seek another term.\n\nA centrist Democrat in his fifth term, Gonzalez has frequently broken with party activists, including publicly warning that Democrats risk alienating voters by moving too far left on matters such as abortion policy and transgender rights. He also ran ahead of the top of the Democratic ticket in 2024, outperforming former Vice President Kamala Harris in the district.\n\nFinancially, Gonzalez begins the race with a meaningful advantage. He closed September with roughly $1.3 million in the bank, more than both of his likely Republican opponents. That includes former Republican Rep. Mayra Flores, whom Gonzalez defeated in back-to-back elections in 2022 and 2024, and Eric Flores, an Army veteran and attorney who is not related to the former congresswoman.\n\nRep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-PA), 7th District\n\nRep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-PA) heads into 2026 defending one of Pennsylvania’s most closely divided seats, a Lehigh Valley district that played a key role in the GOP’s return to the House majority. After capturing the seat last cycle, Mackenzie faces the challenge of holding together a coalition that depends heavily on swing voters in a region known for rapid demographic and political change.\n\nThe district’s sizable Hispanic electorate is expected to be a decisive force, placing added pressure on both parties to compete aggressively for turnout and persuasion. That dynamic is already shaping the Democratic field, where a competitive nomination fight is underway.\n\nNorthampton County Executive Lamont McClure launched his campaign in February and has begun building a financial base, reporting $142,000 in raised funds. He is being challenged by Carol Obando-Derstine, a former utility executive and onetime aide to former Democratic Sen. Bob Casey. Obando-Derstine has secured the endorsement of former Democratic Rep. Susan Wild after entering the race following the most recent filing deadline. He has not yet disclosed fundraising totals.\n\nMackenzie’s fundraising slowed in the third quarter, but he still maintains a sizable financial edge, with $1.4 million cash on hand, well ahead of his Democratic challengers.\n\nRep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA), 1st District\n\nFew House Republicans face a more unforgiving electoral landscape than Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA), whose hold on southeastern Iowa has long been defined by narrow margins and repeat matchups. After four attempts, Miller-Meeks finally won the seat and has since seen each race turn into a high-wire contest. That pattern continued in 2024, when she defeated Democrat Christina Bohannan by just 799 votes.\n\nBohannan, a former state lawmaker and law professor, is seeking a rematch that would mark their third general election showdown, though both candidates must first navigate contested primaries. Miller-Meeks again faces a challenge from David Pautsch, a Gold Star father who drew 44% of the vote in last year’s Republican primary, while Bohannan is competing against attorney Taylor Wettach and healthcare worker Travis Terrell on the Democratic side.\n\nThe razor-thin 2024 result appears to have sharpened Miller-Meeks’s focus on fundraising. She has raised more than $3 million this cycle and ended September with $2.6 million cash on hand, giving her a clear financial edge heading into another competitive year. Bohannan has also posted strong numbers, raising nearly $2 million since entering the race and reporting $1.6 million in the bank.\n\nThe district’s volatility has only heightened the stakes. Trump outpaced Miller-Meeks at the top of the ticket last cycle, underscoring challenges within the GOP coalition and reinforcing why Iowa’s 1st District is once again shaping up as one of the most closely watched House races.\n\nRep. Juan Ciscomani (R-AZ), 6th District \n\nAfter surviving two hard-fought elections against Democrat Kirsten Engel, Rep. Juan Ciscomani (R-AZ) enters the 2026 cycle facing a different kind of test. His latest challenger is JoAnna Mendoza, a Marine Corps veteran from southern Arizona who is positioning herself as a populist alternative focused on cost-of-living pressures and healthcare access.\n\nCiscomani, the first Latino Republican elected to Congress from Arizona and an immigrant from Mexico, has built his profile around water policy and regional infrastructure, matters with particular resonance in the state’s arid southeastern corridor. Mendoza has taken a more confrontational approach, attacking Republican-backed reductions to Medicaid and framing the race as a referendum on economic security for working families.\n\nEarly fundraising reflects a competitive environment. Mendoza edged Ciscomani in third-quarter receipts, raising $696,000 to the incumbent’s $613,000. Even so, Ciscomani retains a substantial financial cushion, closing September with $2.4 million on hand, compared with Mendoza’s $950,000.\n\nRep. Greg Landsman (D-OH), 1st District \n\nRep. Greg Landsman (D-OH) enters the 2026 cycle in a markedly tougher political environment after Ohio’s latest round of redistricting reshaped his Cincinnati-based district. Ohio’s 1st District now absorbs heavily Republican Clinton County while shedding leftward-trending Hamilton County suburbs, transforming a seat Harris carried by six points into one she would have lost by roughly 2 1/2 points. The shift places Landsman among the most vulnerable House Democrats as the party works to claw back the chamber.\n\nReflecting the new terrain, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee added Landsman to its Frontline program in late November, signaling the seat will require significant resources to defend. The move came weeks after Republican lawmakers finalized a map that gives the GOP a structural advantage in the district, setting up a high-stakes and closely watched race in 2026.\n\nLandsman has also moved quickly to build financial strength ahead of the tougher fight. His campaign raised about $1.3 million through the first three quarters of 2025 and reported roughly $1.1 million cash on hand, giving him an early fundraising cushion as national Democrats brace for an expensive defense.\n\nRep. Tom Barrett (R-MI), 7th District \n\nMichigan’s 7th District, one of the few House seats that regularly tracks the presidential winner, is again shaping up as a top Democratic target after Rep. Tom Barrett (R-MI) flipped it in 2024. The freshman Republican defeated Democrat Curtis Hertel by four points and ran ahead of Trump, leaning on his military background to win over swing voters while quickly building his campaign operation. Barrett has continued to build a formidable war chest, raising nearly $2.8 million overall and reporting about $1.8 million in cash on hand in his most recent filing.\n\nDemocrats face a competitive primary led by former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, who raised about $250,000 within a day of launching her campaign, and Matt Maasdam, a retired Navy SEAL and former Obama aide with ties to Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), who previously represented the district. Neither has deep local roots, giving Barrett an opening as he heads into his first midterm with narrow margins and a closely divided electorate likely to decide the race again.\n\nRep. Thomas Kean Jr. (R-NJ), 7th District \n\nRep. Tom Kean Jr. (R-NJ) heads into the 2026 cycle in an increasingly competitive New Jersey district that has steadily moved left over the past decade. The 7th District, which runs along the Pennsylvania border and is home to affluent suburban voters, backed Republicans by double digits during the Obama era before flipping to former President Joe Biden by roughly 3 1/2 points in 2020. While the seat shifted slightly right in 2024, with Trump narrowly carrying it, Democrats continued to show strength down-ballot, reinforcing its status as a true battleground.\n\nKean, a former state Assembly minority leader and the son of a former governor, ousted Democrat Tom Malinowski in 2022 and won reelection last year by five points against Sue Altman, whose past progressive positions limited her general election appeal. The Democratic field is shaping up more favorably this time, with a crowded primary and early fundraising suggesting Rebecca Bennett, a former helicopter pilot, and Tina Shah, a physician and former Obama and Biden administration official, as the leading contenders. \n\nKean has also built a sizable financial advantage early, raising about $2.6 million so far in the 2026 cycle and reporting nearly $2 million cash on hand, giving him a strong fundraising foundation in what is shaping up to be a toss-up race.\n\nRep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA), 2nd District\n\nVirginia’s 2nd District remains one of the most competitive House seats in the country, with a long track record of swinging between the parties. Anchored in Virginia Beach and home to the nation’s largest naval base, the district has voted for Trump in 2016, Biden in 2020, and Trump again in 2024, and has flipped control four times over the past 20 years. Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA) has represented the seat since 2022, but history suggests little room for complacency.\n\nKiggans, a former Navy helicopter pilot and nurse practitioner, is widely expected to face a rematch against former Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria, her 2022 opponent and the clear front-runner for the Democratic nomination despite a contested primary. This time, however, Kiggans runs as the incumbent amid political headwinds tied to Trump, whose federal workforce cuts have landed heavily in a district dominated by military and defense-related employment.\n\nRecent statewide results underscore the district’s volatility. Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) carried the 2nd District by nearly eight points, the strongest Democratic showing there in more than a decade, while Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares narrowly won. Those outcomes point to a wide performance range: from a high-water mark for Republicans in favorable conditions to a clear Democratic edge in a tougher environment. As a result, Kiggans heads into 2026 in a district where small shifts in turnout and ticket-splitting, particularly in Virginia Beach, are likely to determine the outcome once again.\n\nKiggans has also built a sizable campaign account, raising nearly $2.9 million for the cycle and reporting just under $2 million in cash on hand in her most recent filing.\n\nRep. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM), 2nd District \n\nRep. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM) heads into the 2026 cycle defending a New Mexico district that moved sharply to the right last year, narrowly backing Trump even as Vasquez expanded his margin from 2022. The 2nd District, which spans the entirety of New Mexico’s border with Mexico and is roughly 55% Hispanic, remains one of Democrats’ most fragile holds in the Southwest.\n\nRepublicans, who spent much of the year waiting on former Rep. Yvette Herrell before she accepted a Trump administration post, now have a developing primary field. Radio host Eddy Aragon, retired police officer and former legislative candidate Greg Cunningham, and federal contractor Jose Orozco have all entered the race, with GOP operatives still watching for a stronger late-entering contender.\n\nVasquez has so far proven difficult to dislodge, successfully neutralizing attacks on policing and immigration by emphasizing border security, cartel enforcement, and bilingual outreach to Hispanic voters. Democrats are also expected to lean heavily into healthcare, highlighting Trump-backed Medicaid cuts in a district where roughly 40% of residents rely on the program. With immigration and healthcare set to dominate the race, the seat remains competitive but unsettled as Republicans search for a nominee capable of capitalizing on the district’s rightward drift.\n\nSenate Battlegrounds \n\nSen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA)\n\nGeorgia places Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) in a uniquely difficult position: he is the only Democratic senator here running in a state that backed Trump in 2024. The contest will be his first time defending the seat since his narrow runoff victory four years ago, when his win over David Perdue helped tip Senate control to Democrats.\n\nThe Republican side is unsettled and competitive. Sitting Reps. Mike Collins (R-GA) and Buddy Carter (R-GA) are both in the race, joined by Derek Dooley, a political newcomer and former college football coach whose candidacy has drawn support from Gov. Brian Kemp (R-GA). \n\nOssoff has built a substantial financial cushion. He brought in more than $12 million during the third quarter and ended September with over $21 million on hand, far outpacing any of his possible challengers. Democrats are also encouraged by recent down-ballot results in Georgia, including flipping two seats on the state’s Public Service Commission, reinforcing their view that the state remains highly competitive.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-ME) \n\nMaine is lining up for another high-stakes Senate showdown, with Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) preparing for a difficult reelection environment in a state that has continued to trend Democratic at the presidential level. Although she has not yet launched a sixth-term bid, Collins is the only Republican senator representing a state carried by Harris in 2024, putting her squarely in the national spotlight.\n\nDemocrats are already engaged in a competitive and well-funded primary to determine who will challenge her. Gov. Janet Mills (D-ME) faces a challenge from Graham Platner, an oyster farmer whose campaign has tapped into generational and ideological tensions within the party and quickly built financial momentum, raising more than $3 million shortly after launching. Platner’s rise has been complicated by scrutiny over past online activity, while former congressional staffer Jordan Wood has also mounted a serious bid, reporting more than $3 million raised since entering the race this spring.\n\nMeanwhile, Collins is preparing for a familiar set of headwinds as she defends her record amid Democratic attacks over healthcare costs and the fallout from the Supreme Court’s abortion ruling, which came after her last reelection. Still, she begins the cycle with financial strength, ending September with roughly $6.7 million on hand as what could be her toughest reelection race takes shape.\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-TX)\n\nSen. John Cornyn’s (R-TX) reelection threat is coming first and foremost from his own party. For months, the Texas Republican has been locked in a high-stakes primary fight against Attorney General Ken Paxton, a hard-right firebrand who has worked to cast Cornyn as out of step with the GOP base. That challenge intensified with the entry of Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-TX), opening a three-way contest that could further fracture Republican voters and deny Cornyn a clear path to renomination.\n\nSenate GOP leaders have lined up behind Cornyn, and a pro-Cornyn super PAC is already on the air, boosting his candidacy. The spending appears to be helping. An October poll from the University of Houston and Texas Southern University showed Cornyn and Paxton effectively tied, with Hunt trailing in third. Cornyn reported raising $910,000 last quarter through his principal campaign committee and roughly $2.4 million through joint fundraising accounts. Paxton raised $1.3 million over the same period, while Hunt brought in $366,000 through his House campaign account.\n\nDemocrats are simultaneously assembling a crowded and well-funded field in anticipation of a competitive general election if Cornyn survives the primary. Democratic state Rep. James Talarico quickly emerged as a fundraising force, raising $6.2 million in his first three weeks in the race. Former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred, who lost to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) by eight points last year, raised about $4.1 million for his second Senate bid. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) has also entered the race, giving Democrats another high-profile contender with a national profile and strong ties to the party’s progressive base.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) \n\nIn reliably Republican Louisiana, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) is not in danger in a general election. His political risk lies squarely in the GOP primary, where a crowded field of challengers is working to turn lingering distrust from the Republican base into a fatal weakness.\n\nCassidy begins the cycle with a dominant financial position, reporting about $9.5 million cash on hand at the start of October, well ahead of rivals including state Treasurer John Fleming, Republican state Rep. Julie Emerson, Republican state Sen. Blake Miguez, Public Service Commissioner Eric Skrmetta, and St. Tammany Parish Councilwoman Kathy Seiden. But his opponents are less focused on matching his war chest than on relitigating a single vote that still animates Republican primary voters.\n\nCassidy is one of just three sitting GOP senators who voted to convict Trump following the Jan. 6 impeachment trial, and challengers have made that decision a central rallying point as they seek the president’s endorsement. Cassidy allies counter that he has taken visible steps to mend ties with the president, including repeated White House visits and publicly aligning with Trump on key priorities, even as the primary field continues to test whether those efforts are enough to secure renomination.\n\nSen. John Husted (R-OH)\n\nSen. Jon Husted (R-OH) entered the Senate by appointment, elevated earlier this year by Gov. Mike DeWine (R-OH) after Vice President JD Vance vacated the seat for his current position. Backed by DeWine and well known within state Republican circles, Husted begins the cycle with little resistance inside his party, a stark contrast to the bruising GOP primaries that defined Ohio’s recent Senate races.\n\nThe general election picture is far less settled. Democrats have turned to a familiar figure in former Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, who is attempting a comeback after losing to Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH) in 2024. Brown’s entry has given Democrats their clearest path to contention in a state that has drifted reliably red in recent cycles. \n\nMoney will play an outsize role. Brown has moved quickly to rebuild his campaign infrastructure, raising roughly $7 million in the six weeks following his launch. Meanwhile, Husted closed September with approximately $5 million cash on hand, reinforcing his position as a well-funded incumbent heading into a high-profile special election to fill the remaining two years of Vance’s term.","summary":"With control of Congress expected to hinge on a narrow margin in 2026, a small group of House and Senate incumbents is already emerging as the most vulnerable lawmakers of the coming cycle.

The answer was a resounding “nothing.”\n\nHonestly, the people who have spent years demonizing the police at every turn – all police, no matter the reason, no matter the cause, without exception – never sent out an email telling donors to “thank police.” Could you imagine the absolute fecal storm that would happen if an intern accidentally sent an email like that? I can see the marches and cities burning already.\n\nBut, instead of the police, it’s the postal employees. Nothing against postal workers, but I don’t recall them doing anything other than their jobs, and there is nothing special about simply doing your job. The “thanking” is the pay, the benefits and the pension. (Not to mention the massive subsidies from taxpayers to cover the operating costs.)\n\nTo Democrats, however, the email opens, “Postal workers are the HEROES of our holiday season!” Jesus isn’t the reason for the season, it’s your mailman!\n\n“Sign the card to thank our nation's postal workers for working tirelessly to deliver millions of gifts and holiday cards this season,” it continues.\n\nWeirdly, the Democrats didn’t thank the people who actually delivered the vast majority of gifts (by a lot): Amazon delivery drivers. I don’t know about you, but I see the mail truck come through my neighborhood once per day and Amazon trucks and just drivers delivering in cars about 20 times. My family’s Christmas didn’t come with a stamp; it came with an Amazon label.\n\nHow about yours?\n\nWhy not thank Amazon drivers, or at least thank them too? They aren’t unionized, so they don’t have dues taken by “leaders” and given to Democrats as the run for reelection like the Postal Union does.\n\nIt all goes to Democrats, including worthless people like Rashida Tlaib, Jon Tester and Kamala Harris. That’s why Democrats care, and it’s the ONLY reason they care.\n\nThe email continues, “come snow, rain, heat, or gloom of night, the USPS has tirelessly ensured that Americans receive the mail they need. From delivering prescription drugs to Social Security checks to holiday gifts, our postal workers always get the job done.”\n\nHilariously, I’ve seen the mail canceled over snow, and who still gets physical checks?\n\nThey go on, “That's why this holiday season, we want to show our gratitude with a MASSIVE thank you card for our dedicated public servants. We need 250,000 signatures before we can send it, and we're counting on you to help us get it to the finish line!”\n\nNotice the word they don’t use? It’s “Christmas.” Never once is it mentioned. I mean, they sent the damn email on Christmas Day and they never once typed the word.\n\nIt ends, “Please, Derek, help us show our appreciation: Sign the card before midnight to thank postal workers across the country for their hard work!”\n\nThe only way to “sign” the card is to donate to the DSCC, by the way. That’s how you know they care. \n\nYears of “Defund the Police” have never led to “Thank the Police” from Democrats, because why would you thank something you despise? But postal workers? Well, police unions don’t unilaterally and uniformly “give” to Democrats, but the postal workers union does. And, as is always the case with Democrats, with money comes absolute loyalty.\n\nWithout money, as the police have learned, comes indifference, both to their existence and their murder, and appointed leadership more interested in a political agenda and racial demographics than qualifications. Democrats demand police leadership as incompetent as postal leadership, and the people who do the actual work are left out in the cold, in both cases.\n\nThank whoever you want, but note how Democrats only ever use the word to their advantage, which cheapens it and says everything you need to know about them.\n\nDerek Hunter is the host of the Derek Hunter Show on WMAL in Washington, DC, and has a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses, and host of the weekly “Week in F*cking Review” podcast where the news is spoken about the way it deserves to be.

There were too few cars and too much confusion over its services. Insurance costs had skyrocketed.\n\nThen came a decision by the Trump administration to cancel a $560,000 federal grant intended to enable HourCar to add dozens of electric vehicles on St. Paul’s East Side, a service area that commercial carsharing companies like Car2Go and ZipCar mostly avoided before exiting the Twin Cities a decade ago.\n\nHourCar, based on Prior Avenue in St. Paul, announced this month that it had installed an electric-vehicle charging hub at an affordable-housing development on the East Side anyway, testing a partnership strategy it hopes to see expand to more housing sites over the coming year.\n\n“Where there’s a will, there’s a way,” said Brendmoen, former president of the St. Paul City Council, during a recent ride-along.\n\nHourCar drew national attention in 2022 when it joined with St. Paul and Minneapolis to debut the all-electric Evie Spot Network. While commercial carsharing is nothing new, the prospect of a nonprofit rolling out a fleet of municipally backed electric vehicles for public use across city borders represented a national first for an industry still trying to raise its profile as an alternative to car ownership.\n\nRather than return a traditional HourCar to a handful of designated drop-off hubs, the electric Evies can be left overnight at no cost at any legal parking spot within their service area, which covers most but not all of both cities. That includes most parking meters and dozens of Evie Spot charging stations.\n\nThrough agreements with both cities, the charging stations have been installed along parks and public sidewalks, and in commercial lots or housing developments through arrangements with private property owners. The Evie Spot fleet has gradually grown from 175 electric vehicles to nearly 300, adding 45 Chevy Equinox vehicles in recent weeks despite the loss of federal backing.\n\nTargeting affordable housing\n\nAmong her goals, Brendmoen has sought to emphasize that HourCar and the Evie Spot Network compose one network offering two types of services, which has been a point of confusion for some prospective customers.\n\nOther innovations include a redesigned website, updated mobile app and online price calculator for trip planning. New carshare hubs were announced this month at three affordable multi-family housing developments, including the Little Mod apartments near Otto Avenue and Shepard Road, and the Capital View Apartments on Old Hudson Road, both of which are in St. Paul.\n\nIn Minneapolis, there’s a new charging hub at Children’s Village Apartments on Franklin Avenue.\n\n“This is a workforce solution,” Brendmoen said. “It allows someone to use a car while they’re saving up to buy a car.”\n\nMore hubs will be added over the next year at affordable housing developments, Brendmoen said, and despite the loss of federal dollars, HourCar remains committed to expanding Evie’s charging stations elsewhere on St. Paul’s East Side.\n\nA larger fleet and service area will require more car maintenance. To that end, financial support from 3M Gives and the city of St. Paul’s Neighborhood STAR program is allowing HourCar to upgrade its East Side repair shop by adding a second mechanic bay, new equipment and a second full-time mechanic, facilitating more in-house repairs for cost savings.\n\nExpansion plans\n\nThe HourCar board of directors hopes to add more partnerships over the next year, possibly including additional cities, transit agencies, building owners and community organizations. Hospitals could be a next frontier. Evies can be left overnight at most parking meters without a fee, exceptions include meters on the University of Minnesota campus, which still charge users for parking by the minute.\n\nThe U has taken the general approach that fewer cars on campus would be better, but Brendmoen is quick to point out that carsharing allows exactly that. Vehicle turnover on campus is brisk, allowing more students to live virtually car-free while knowing they have vehicle access when they need it, she said.\n\nBrendmoen maintains the HourCar/Evie system is price-competitive with hailing an Uber, even after $7 monthly (or $84 annual) subscription rates that include up to 200 daily miles. Low-income student rates are as low as $1 monthly.\n\n“An average car drives 5% of the time,” she said, during the Dec. 19 ride-along. “Our cars drive 30% of the time. At the U of M, they sit only 40 minutes. If they’re at the U campus, they move.”\n\nIn a written statement Friday, Brendmoen added that her team had since met with the transportation department at the U this month “to discuss how to better leverage HourCar and Evie to help the University reach its goal to reduce car traffic on campus and to reduce its climate impact. A shared vehicle gives students ability to run errands or take short trips without the cost or storage issues that come with owning a vehicle. We are excited to forge an even stronger partnership … as we expand.”\n\nClean energy grants canceled\n\nThis is a challenging time for clean energy advocacy, on multiple levels.\n\nSt. Paul had been counting on more than $560,000 from the U.S. Department of Energy to expand the Evie network to low-to-moderate income areas on the city’s East Side. The funding was eliminated in October, along with more than $7.5 billion in grants for clean energy projects across 16 states, all of which were states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe city has joined the Environmental Defense Fund and other environmental and energy-oriented advocacy groups in suing the federal Department of Energy and Office of Management and Budget over the loss in funding, which is undercutting 321 clean energy projects across the country.\n\nMeanwhile, consumer hesitancy toward electric vehicles in America likely stems from a variety of factors, ranging from price to questions about where to charge them, especially during long trips.\n\nIn the United States, electric vehicles account for just 10% of new car sales. Even combined, hybrid, electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles constitute about 20% of sales, a modest showing compared to some European countries where they now comprise the majority of new purchases.\n\nIn April 2024, the St. Paul City Council approved new requirements that future surface parking lots spanning at least 15 parking stalls be developed with conduit ready for EV charging stations.\n\nThe rules do not require the installation of the chargers themselves, in recognition that the technology will evolve with time, but that 80% of the stalls in residential lots be conduit-ready. In commercial lots, the requirement is limited to 20% of all stalls, given that most drivers will not be charging their cars in business lots overnight.","summary":"HourCar announced this month that it installed an electric-vehicle charging hub at an affordable-housing development on the East Side.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/12/28/evie-electric-carshare-seeks-to-expand-despite-loss-of-federal-grant/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/STP-L-ELECTRIC-0520-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 00:41:03","author":"Frederick Melo","authors":["Frederick Melo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.307},{"id":389723266,"title":"Bikini-clad Heidi Klum, 52, dries off with a towel emblazoned with toyboy husband Tom Kaulitz's FACE as they hit beach in sun-soaked St. Barths","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBlake Lively\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nU.K. Showbiz\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Dec 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrandma who beat cancer five times is fatally shot on Christmas Day after her neighbor's target practice goes horribly wrong, police say\n\nFast moving winter storm and possible 'bomb cyclone' set to sweep across the country as 40 million Americans are placed on alert\n\nMelanie Watson dead at 57: Diff'rent Strokes star dies after suffering severe health complications in hospital\n\nSnorting cocaine on the floor, cuckolding JFK Jr and the day Carolyn Bessette humiliated herself at Mar-a-Lago: Every poisonous detail, told by friends and family\n\nI'm a psychiatrist who almost never prescribes antidepressants.

And the Democratic presidential primaries are just over two years away, so it’s a great time to take stock of the prospects—and what better way than to rank them?\n\nThings will change a lot in the next two years, but the polling firm Echelon Insights has been conducting regular surveys of the prospective 2028 field since days after the 2024 election. And here are the six Democrats who have polled at an average of 5% or better in the four most recent surveys. \n\nLet’s say that again: This is a ranking of current support, not a ranking of preference.\n\n1. Kamala Harris\n\nMaybe Democrats just can’t let her go. And maybe she isn’t done, either.\n\nHarris, the former vice president who lost the 2024 election, has led all but two of Echelon’s 11 polls on the topic. That’s no doubt due to the fact that 95% of U.S. adults know who she is, according to YouGov, and name recognition is a major reason why 96% of House incumbents running for reelection won their races in 2024. \n\nIn other words, her performance is primarily because people already know her. But her high spot probably won’t last. Her average support in Echelon’s four most recent surveys is 22%, but her support has steadily dropped over the past year, falling to just 17% in November before rebounding slightly to 22% in December. \n\nThe reason for that slide is obvious: Democrats’ fondness for her is fading as we get further away from the 2024 election—an election she lost, after all. But not only did she lose the Electoral College, she was also just the second Democrat in the past 35 years to lose the popular vote. \n\nAs the nostalgia for the highs of her feel-good campaign continues to wear off, and as other Democrats boost their national profiles, it’s easy to imagine her falling off the top of this list—if she does decide to give it another go.\n\n2. Gavin Newsom\n\nHas anyone ever wanted it more?\n\nDespite resembling a villainous landlord in a Muppets movie, Newsom has situated himself as the Anti-Trump. California’s governor will sue Trump liberally, fight back on Trump’s attempts to rig the midterm elections, and even mock Trump’s style of posting online. All of this has caused him to dominate the news compared with other potential 2028 contenders.\n\nIn the past 90 days, Google searches for Newsom easily outpaced those of Harris and other potential Democratic contenders, demonstrating his ability to grab headlines—a critical skill in a crowded primary.\n\nNo doubt as a result, he became the first name to top Harris in Echelon’s polling, doing so in both of its November and December surveys.\n\nA sign of potential trouble for him is that despite his large national profile, YouGov finds that only 32% of Democrats have a favorable view of him—unusually low among the top 2028 prospects. That’s likely due to his slippery style of politics, which shifts rapidly based on the political winds. For instance, he was a strong advocate for single-payer health care in 2018, only to retreat from it in 2022. The same thing has happened with trans rights, immigrant rights, and more.\n\nWith Newsom, you’re never quite sure what his core beliefs are, other than amassing power. But maybe voters don’t mind that too much. After all, it worked out pretty well for Trump.\n\n3. Pete Buttigieg\n\nMayor Pete has risen further and stuck around longer than most expected. He led the Transportation Department under former President Joe Biden, and since Trump retook the White House, Buttigieg has kept himself relevant through his willingness to go on Fox News and podcasts, pitching himself to voters wary of Democrats.\n\nThree-fourths of Americans know Buttigieg’s name, and he’s well liked among Democrats, per YouGov. As a result, he pulls in an average of 10% support across the four most recent surveys from Echelon.\n\nBut Buttigieg faces big hurdles if he runs. \n\nFor one, he’s married to a man. Despite the nation’s progress on LGBTQ+ rights over the past 20 years, 1 in 3 Americans still finds same-sex relations to be morally wrong, according to Gallup. While many of those homophobes are unlikely to ever vote for a Democrat, a recent study also found that support for his candidacy in the 2020 Democratic primary decreased when voters were made aware of his sexuality. \n\nButtigieg also has some constituency hang-ups. During the 2020 primary, he received almost no support from Black voters, a key base for the Democratic Party. Instead, his support was driven by highly educated white voters. In other words, if Democrats want to expand their multicultural coalition in 2028, Buttigieg will have to put in a lot more effort than he did last time.\n\n4. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\n\nOcasio-Cortez has the second-best favorability and is basically tied with Newsom in name recognition, though she scores only fourth-best on average in the polling (6%).\n\nBut the data might undercut the passion of the New York representative’s fans, who skew younger and more liberal. Many of the Democrats who like her love her. It’s why thousands turned out, even in red states, to hear her and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders speak. Such dedicated fans would likely give her an edge in building out a canvassing operation.\n\nWhat stands in her way? Well, despite her charisma and moving speeches, she is a democratic socialist in a nation still skeptical of that label. Though the broad strokes of her platform are popular, some of her policies will face severe scrutiny if she runs. For example, she wants to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement—she even sells “Abolish ICE” hats—but it’s a view shared by only 27% of Americans, according to YouGov. \n\nThere’s some debate over how much moderation matters in elections, but the fact it could be an issue may scare Democratic voters. If Ocasio-Cortez ran and picked up steam, it’s easy to imagine the Democratic establishment consolidating around a moderate alternative as they did in 2020, when various center-left candidates dropped out and endorsed Joe Biden in order to block Sanders from winning the nomination.\n\nThere’s also the possible issue of Ocasio-Cortez’s age. If elected president in 2028, she would be 39 on Inauguration Day 2029, making her the youngest president ever. (Currently, the youngest is Theodore Roosevelt, who took office at 42.)\n\nThat may be why she stays out of the 2028 presidential race and instead runs for Senate, which she is reportedly also considering. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s term is up that year, and his approval rating has been in the dumps.\n\n5. Cory Booker\n\nRemember that speech?\n\nEarly in Trump’s new term, Booker delivered a record-breaking 25-hour rebuke of the president on the Senate floor. And it lifted him into second place (11%) in Echelon’s April poll of the hypothetical 2028 field, which was conducted about two weeks later.\n\nBut if you’ve already forgotten that speech, you’re not alone. Just over one month later, his support was half that, at 6%. And it’s been sliding ever since.\n\nIf he runs in 2028, he’s sure to face the same problems that dogged him when he ran in 2020: He wasn’t interesting enough to get attention, and his fundraising from business executives and Wall Street types reeked of corporate politics, which Democrats are generally sour on.\n\nIn 2020, he dipped out of the primary before the first ballot was cast. Currently, it’s hard to see what would make 2028 any different.\n\n6. Josh Shapiro\n\nShapiro has the best electability argument among the top candidates in our data. The governor of swingy Pennsylvania, he won his 2022 race by a huge 15-point margin. That said, his performance was boosted by the race’s exceptionally weak Republican candidate, Doug Mastriano, an election denier who chartered buses to Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, and was shown on video to be near the Capitol riot.\n\nDespite the Keystone State’s purple tint, Shapiro enjoys a surprising level of popularity, with 62% of the state’s voters approving of his job as governor. By all reports, he’s proved to be a generally effective executive. Heck, he rebuilt an interstate bridge in the 12 days after it collapsed. \n\nIf he runs, Shapiro, who is Jewish, would no doubt be subjected to antisemitism—in fact, he already has been—but polls suggest voters are very open to voting for a Jewish candidate for president. \n\nPerhaps his larger concern in winning a primary is whether he can draw the electorate’s attention. His anti-Trump efforts this year have barely made a ripple. He has also strongly defended Israel amid its brutal attacks on the Gaza Strip, and he’s lambasted pro-Palestitian protests on U.S. college campuses, though he appears more willing to criticize Israel’s conduct as of late. Regardless, his broader response could meet a chilly reception from Democratic voters nationwide, who have greatly soured on Israel.\n\n Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has been a ready anti-Trump voice, but the biggest question is how he’d make a stronger pitch than Newsom, who is much more well-known and commands more headlines. Also, as a billionaire who recently shrugged off winning $1.4 million playing blackjack in Vegas, Pritzker cuts something of an awkward figure to lead a party in which very, very few think billionaires have a positive effect on society.\n\n Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, the baldest man who ever lived, is a rumored 2028 candidate, though he hasn’t been the most prominent Democrat on the Hill, unless you count that time Trump targeted him for killing.\n\n Though often mentioned in 2028 talk, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has mostly faded into the background of Trump’s second term—when she doesn’t pop up and tarnish her credibility. All this to say, if you’re not making waves as Trump runs ripshod over the nation, then what are you doing?\n\n Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has by far the best electability argument of any potential candidate. Trump won the Bluegrass State by nearly 31 points in 2024, the year after Beshear won it by 5 points. That said, Beshear has a small national profile—and that’ll be a deep hole to climb out of if he chooses to challenge the big names on this list.\n\n Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, and California Rep. Ro Khanna are often mentioned as possible 2028 contenders, but in Echelon’s polls, all of them regularly score less than 1% support, if they’re included at all. As things stand, they seem like clear also-ran material, if they even run in the first place.\n\nThere’s the field right now, though it’s early and there’s always a chance a new name makes waves. \n\nWho do you want to see at the top of the Democratic ticket in 2028?","summary":"Amid the waking hell of the second Trump administration, it’s hard not to pine for 2028.

That’s no doubt due to the fact that 95% of U.S. adults know who she is, according to YouGov, and name recognition is a maj","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/12/28/2354469/-Who-s-the-top-2028-Democratic-contender?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1508935/story_image/EDITORSImageTreatmentsforSeries.png?1766080258","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-29 00:00:03","author":"Andrew Mangan","authors":["Andrew Mangan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.279},{"id":389730502,"title":"New Poll Reveals Which Politicians Democrats Prefer Over Santa Claus","text":"Democrats favor Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Kamala Harris over both a selection of other prominent Democrats and even Santa Claus, according to a JL Partners poll for the Daily Mail released Sunday.\n\nSt. Nick received a net favorability rating of 59 percent, compared to a net favorability of 65 for Sanders, a two-time presidential candidate who campaigned on free health care and free college, the Daily Mail reported. Former Vice President Harris scored a 62 percent net favorability rating. The poll was conducted among 383 Democratic primary voters between Dec. 17 and 19, and has a 5 percent margin of error. (RELATED: Minnesota Democrats Attempted To Derail GOP Lawmaker Discussing Somali Scandal Months Before Story Blew Up)\n\nOther potential 2028 Democratic presidential primary candidates in the poll include Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has a 46 percent net favorability. Below her are Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz with a 40 percent net favorability rating and Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had a 37 percent net favorability rating.\n\nDemocratic Governors J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Wes Moore of Maryland, in addition to former Democratic Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, trailed lower in the poll, with none scoring a net favorability above 23 percent.\n\nThe poll also counted respondents who were ready to ditch Christmas traditions like sweaters (22 percent), Elf on a Shelf (15 percent), and matching family pajamas (14 percent). It also found that only 37 percent consider “Die Hard” a Christmas movie.\n\nDemocrats’ overall favorability plummeted to 29 percent, according to a CNN poll released in March 2025, as the party faces infighting and difficulty meeting fundraising goals. A July poll conducted by Quinnipiac shows only 19 percent of respondents approved of the party’s Congressional leadership. A poll released Thursday by the center-left think tank Third Way found congressional Republicans have a slight edge in favorability over their Democratic colleagues, 42-40 percent.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Then-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris was inside the DNC headquarters when law enforcement found the pipe bomb outside the building, but she was quickly evacuated after U.S. Capitol Police arrived on the scene.\n\nCole also told investigators he was inspired by The Troubles, a violent sectarian conflict that began in the 1960s in Northern Ireland, where paramilitary groups have used pipe bombs in hundreds of attacks since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.\n\nCole is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday at 1 p.m. for his detention hearing. The prosecutor listed on his docket is Assistant U.S. Attorney Jocelyn Ballantine, who oversaw the prosecution of the leaders of the far-right group the Proud Boys for their role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/28/pipe-bomb-justice-department-jan-6-suspect-00707242","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/a2722bd/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F60%2Fe7%2F5aaa08584f14876a19b342eaaec4%2Ffbi-pipe-bomb-investigation-64768.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 23:08:00","author":"Jacob Wendler","authors":["Jacob Wendler"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.02},{"id":389726662,"title":"Adam Peaty and Holly Ramsay's wedding day 'overshadowed by security guards, dog patrols and mandatory wristbands' which led one guest to compare the nuptials to a 'hospital appointment'","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBlake Lively\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nU.K. Showbiz\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Dec 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrandma who beat cancer five times is fatally shot on Christmas Day after her neighbor's target practice goes horribly wrong, police say\n\nFather of abducted children breaks his silence after eerie video emerges showing his children being boarded on international flight\n\nMelanie Watson dead at 57: Diff'rent Strokes star dies after suffering severe health complications in hospital\n\nSnorting cocaine on the floor, cuckolding JFK Jr and the day Carolyn Bessette humiliated herself at Mar-a-Lago: Every poisonous detail, told by friends and family\n\nI'm a psychiatrist who almost never prescribes antidepressants.

Shame on you both. Shame.\n'Remember on this, your happiest day, and on each anniversary of your happiest day, that you hurt your mum so deeply her soul screams.'\nThe roots of this terrible family conflict go back to September 2024, when Adam and Holly snubbed wider members of the Peaty family by not inviting them to their engagement party.\nCaroline, who spent years ferrying her son to early–morning training sessions, was also not invited to Holly's glamorous hen do at Soho Farmhouse in the Cotswolds last month, even though the bride's mother, Tana Ramsay, and friends including Victoria Beckham, were at the extravagant bash.\nVictoria BeckhamAdam PeatyHolly Ramsay\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nAdam Peaty and Holly Ramsay's wedding day 'overshadowed by security guards, dog patrols and mandatory wristbands' which led one guest to compare the nuptials to a 'hospital appointment'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (192)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\neeileenb, Oxford., United Kingdom, moments ago\n\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\n\nThe irony is that they didn't want Peaty's family going because they would lower the tone and then the event turns out to the one of the most tackiest looking weddings I have ever had the misfortune to lay my eyes on.Who on earth was the wedding pl.... \n\nClick to rate\n\neeileenb, Oxford., United Kingdom, 7 minutes ago\n\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\n\nWhat a complete and utter shambles...\n\nClick to rate\n\nLLincsmale, Grantham, United Kingdom, 26 minutes ago\n\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\n\nThere can't be any more rubbish to write about this wedding, we've seen enough for the last 4-5 days.\n\nClick to rate\n\nShow 189 More Comments\nThe opinions and views expressed in the comments section are solely those of the individual users and do not represent or reflect the opinions, views, or positions of Daily Mail.

With more than 10 months to go before Election Day, primary season is already in full swing, and several gubernatorial races across the country have been marked by unpredictability and drawn significant attention.\n\nIncumbent Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won reelection by nearly 20 percentage points in 2022, is term limited and cannot run for a third consecutive time—paving the way for a contested GOP primary to succeed him.\n\nLong-regarded as a hotly-contested swing state, Florida is now a Republican stronghold that Trump carried by 13 points in 2024. Therefore, it is widely believed that the candidate that emerges as the party’s nominee for the governor’s mansion following the Aug. 18, 2026 primary will win the November general election. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the Sunshine State’s contest as “Solid R.”\n\nTrump had endorsed Florida Republican Rep. Byron Donalds for governor in February—five days before Donalds entered the race—cementing the 47-year-old congressman as the race’s early odds-on frontrunner. In addition to the president, Donalds also has received the support of Republican Florida Sen. Rick Scott, a handful of his congressional colleagues, multiple members of Trump’s cabinet and billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nDeSantis, however, has yet to make an endorsement and may still back another GOP primary candidate. An anonymous source familiar with Florida politics told the Daily Caller in November that the state’s sitting governor is “point-blank trashing” Donalds to donors. Donalds, along with the vast majority of Florida’s congressional Republicans, notably endorsed Trump over DeSantis in the 2024 Republican presidential primary. \n\nRepublican Florida Lt. Gov. Jay Collins, a key DeSantis ally whom the governor appointed to the state’s No. 2 job in August, has signaled that he is open to entering the gubernatorial race but has also yet to either declare his candidacy or decline to run.\n\nEarly in 2025, observers speculated that DeSantis’ wife Casey DeSantis may run to succeed her husband, but such talk has subsided. Mrs. DeSantis has yet to state her intention either way.\n\nDonalds’ only current primary challenger to have held electoral office is former Florida state House Speaker Paul Renner, a self-styled “pro-Trump, pro-DeSantis Republican.” Despite this, DeSantis has come out in vocal opposition to Renner’s longshot campaign, calling his former legislative ally’s decision to run “ill-advised.”\n\nAlso in the GOP primary race is James Fishback, the 30-year-old CEO of investment firm Azoria Partners and a vocal critic of H-1B visas, who is campaigning to Donalds’ right. Fishback in February came under scrutiny after proposing the viral idea that Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency send $5,000 dividend checks to households using money saved by the initiative.\n\nStopping short of entering the race, Collins in a Nov. 20 X post took a dig at Donalds writing, “In my first 100 days as Lieutenant Governor, I’ve already outperformed the guy in Congress still trying to convince people he’s ready to lead Florida.”\n\nIn response to a user asking him to say Donalds’ name, the lieutenant governor replied “H1-Byron,” appearing to repeat a line of attack also used by Fishback to paint the Trump-endorsed candidate as too lenient on the issue of immigration.\n\nDemocrat candidates vying to succeed DeSantis include former Republican Florida Rep. David Jolly—a former MSNBC contributor widely associated with the “Never Trump” movement—and Jerry Demings, deep-blue Orange County’s mayor and former sheriff. The Democratic Party has not won Florida’s governor’s mansion since 1994.\n\nSimilar to Florida, Ohio is a former swing state that is now firmly in the Republican column, with Trump carrying it by double digits in 2024. The Buckeye and Sunshine states are also similar in that Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, like DeSantis, is term-limited and cannot seek reelection.\n\nHowever, unlike Donalds, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, the Trump-endorsed candidate seems to have cleared the GOP field, with the Ohio Republican Party opting in May to endorse him. Ramaswamy, who ran against Trump and DeSantis in the 2024 GOP presidential primary, has also received the endorsements of Musk, Vice President JD Vance—a native Ohioan—and both of Ohio’s senators. \n\nTrump originally announced that Ramaswamy would work with Musk to jointly run DOGE, but as the president began his second term, Ramaswamy instead pivoted to running for governor and never ended up joining the initiative.\n\nThe businessman currently is the only well-known GOP candidate running for Ohio governor. Republican Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague and Republican Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost have both in the first half of 2025 dropped out of the GOP gubernatorial primary with the former endorsing Ramaswamy.\n\nOn the Democrat side, former Ohio Department of Health director Amy Acton seems poised to win the nomination as Democrat Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan passed on a run and Sherrod Brown announced a bid to return to the upper chamber instead. Acton notably presided over the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020—which many critics have slammed as too heavy-handed.\n\nWhen asked by Daily Caller Senior Editor Amber Duke if she had regretted closing Ohio’s schools in the name of COVID, Acton replied, “No, actually, what we were following was the pandemic playbook.”\n\nRamaswamy has himself hammered Acton on the issue, writing in a June post to X, “Dr. Amy Acton, the Chief Lockdown Officer of Ohio, led us to be the *first state in the nation* to close our public schools, while private schools remained open. … Acton owes our public school students an apology & shouldn’t come anywhere near the levers of power again.”However, recent polling shows that despite Ohio’s strong Republican lean, a Democrat upset in what many are saying is shaping up to be a “blue wave” year may just be on the horizon. A December 2025 Emerson College poll found Acton with a one point lead over Ramaswamy, with 46% of support to his 45%. Emerson College’s poll from four months earlier showed Ramaswamy with a 10-point lead over the Democrat, 49% to 39%.\n\nCook Political report rates the race as “Likely R.”\n\nAs term-limited Democrat California Gov. Gavin Newsom likely gears up to mount his highly-anticipated 2028 presidential run, the state has the potential to elect a Republican to succeed him in 2026.\n\nAlthough California is a heavily Democrat state, its top-two primary could conceivably result in an all-Republican general election matchup if a crowded Democrat field splits the vote, allowing top GOP candidates—Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News host Steve Hilton—to finish first and second. \n\nNo clear Democrat frontrunner has emerged, with just six months before voters cast their ballots in the June 2, 2026 all-party primary. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, the party’s failed 2024 presidential nominee, announced in late July that she would not seek the California governorship two years after losing the race for the White House—something Richard Nixon tried and failed to do in 1962.\n\nA handful of well-known Democrats remain in the race to take up Newsom’s mantle including, most notably, former Democrat Rep. Katie Porter—who made headlines for appearing to abuse her staff and for allegedly dumping scalding hot mashed potatoes on her then-husband’s head—and Democrat Rep. Eric Swalwell—a prominent Trump foe who announced his candidacy on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” in late November.\n\nSwalwell was absent for more House votes than any one of his current colleagues, according to data analyzed by the New York Post. The Trump administration in November referred the congressman to the Department of Justice for alleged mortgage fraud.\n\nOther Democrats vying to replace Newsom include former Joe Biden-era Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer, to name a few.\n\nWhile multiple recent polls show the possibility of a fiercely split Democrat primary field locking the party out of the general election, Cook Political Report still rates the race “Solid D.”\n\nBianco told the Daily Caller News Foundation in a December interview that the lack of a Democrat frontrunner shows that the party is in “shambles” and has “no leadership.”\n\n“If you look back in history, there’s always a secession plan. There’s always someone else in line. That’s how Newsom got in there,” Bianco added. “But the problem for them [Democrats] now is Newsom is the biggest narcissist, probably, in the world and, in his eyes, there is no one capable of filling his shoes.”\n\nMeanwhile, California’s neighbor Arizona, the adopted home state of slain Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, presents the Republicans’ best chance to unseat an incumbent Democrat governor.\n\nDemocrat Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs is seeking a second term in office after defeating her Republican opponent by only 17,000 votes in 2022. Hobbs has faced numerous controversies while in office, including a “play-to-pay” campaign finance scandal and her reported lack of transparency about her legal donations.\n\nIn addition, the vulnerable governor had a dismal 39% approval rating, compared to a 40% disapproval, according to an Emerson College poll released in mid-November.\n\nHobbs will take on the winner of what is now a three-way Republican primary, scheduled for Aug. 4, 2026. Cook Political report rates Arizona’s gubernatorial race a “Toss Up.” \n\nThe three Republicans currently vying for the GOP nomination to take on Hobbs in the general election are Republican Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, businesswoman Karrin Taylor Robson and Republican Arizona Rep. David Schweikert. Trump has co-endorsed Biggs and Robson while Kirk had solely endorsed Biggs prior to his Sept. 10 assassination. Schweikert entered the race months after both of the other two candidates.\n\nEmerson College’s mid-November poll showed Hobbs trailing the two Trump-endorsed candidates by one point each and Schweikert by four points. Biggs had a massive lead over both of his primary opponents with 50% of support compared to Robson’s 17% and Schweikert’s 8%, according to the same poll.\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Caller’s Ashley Brasfield at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in December, Biggs said that he is “acting like I’m the only one that has [Trump’s] endorsement,” highlighting his close relationship with the president.“Trump and I go back to the first election … he knows I’ve been in the foxholes,” Biggs, who’s been in Congress since 2017, told Brasfield. “I’ve gone through two impeachments with him and about five investigations where I was one of the lead defense counsels, so to speak, for him on all of those. And he knows that. And even know he’ll call me and we’ll talk and we have that relationship ongoing.”\n\n“You can say anybody’s endorsed by you but if you don’t have a relationship with him, it doesn’t really matter,” the GOP frontrunner added.\n\nFinally, Michigan proves another prime chance for Republicans to flip a governor’s mansion from blue to red—but this time because of a left-leaning independent candidate who might play spoiler.\n\nDemocrat Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, like Newsom, is both a rumored potential 2028 White House candidate and barred from running for a third term due to term limits. Cook Political report rates the race to succeed Whitmer as a “Toss Up.”\n\nThe open Democrat primary to succeed the incumbent governor features three main candidates, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson. Whitmer has stated she has no plans to endorse any candidate in the primary.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Michigan Rep. John James is the heavy frontrunner to capture the GOP nomination, with his most prominent intraparty rival being former Republican Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox.\n\nTrump has yet to endorse a candidate in the GOP primary, but has previously endorsed James during his successful runs for the House as well as his unsuccessful runs for U.S. Senate in both 2018 and 2020.\n\nHowever, the presence of independent Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan—a former lifelong Democrat who left the party in 2024—on the ballot may swing the race in James’ favor.\n\nA Plymouth Union Public Research poll released in mid-October showed James in the lead with 35% of support among likely voters, compared to 31% of support for a generic Democrat and 12% for Duggan. Similarly, an EPIC-MRA poll released in early November showed 34% of support for James, 33% for Benson and 20% for Duggan.\n\nDuggan blasted his former party in October, telling Politico, “Everything the Democrats have to say is terrible about Republicans.”\n\n“I am waiting for the Democratic Party to step forward and say, ‘Here’s our affordable housing proposal. Here’s our mental health treatment proposal,’” the independent gubernatorial candidate added at the time. “It’s just been so frustrating to watch the Democratic Party lose its way.”\n\nOriginally published by The Daily Caller News Foundation.","summary":"DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—While the 2026 midterm elections have garnered widespread media attention for the fierce battle to control both houses of Congress, voters in...

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) should have been one of the year’s biggest winners. She had positioned herself as one of the faces of President Donald Trump’s “MAGA” movement. Trump’s 2024 victory should have supercharged her political career. Greene’s problem, though, was that she was only popular among MAGA, and her appeal was nearly nonexistent outside of die-hard Republicans.\n\nTRUMP’S FIVE MOST CONTROVERSIAL PARDONS OF 2025\n\nSo, when Greene tried to run for Senate in Georgia, Trump’s team commissioned a poll showing her losing (in a landslide) to Democrat Jon Ossoff. Trump privately scuttled Greene’s ambitions. She responded by lashing out at him and Republicans with Democratic talking points. Trump trashed her on social media and effectively nuked any future for Greene in Republican politics. She chose to resign from the House, effective early 2026.\n\nGreene now spends her days pushing Palestinian propaganda and praising Venezuelan socialist dictator Nicholas Maduro, all while pretending that she is more “America first” than Trump. Greene was always toxic outside of her deep-red congressional district. She will undoubtedly pop up on some anti-conservative, faux-patriotic media network, such as Tucker Carlson’s, a far cry from the Senate seat she planned on running for at the beginning of the year.\n\nAndrew Cuomo\n\nAndrew Cuomo resigned from the governor’s office in New York in disgrace in 2021, after sexual harassment accusations and a cover-up of the nursing home COVID-19 deaths that his terrible policies caused during the pandemic. With New York City Mayor Eric Adams embroiled in his own scandals, Cuomo finally launched his redemption tour with a run for the mayor’s office.\n\nIt failed miserably. Cuomo was drubbed by communist Zohran Mamdani in the Democratic primary, and then decided to jump into the general election as an independent candidate. Cuomo lost that too, leaving New York in the hands of Mamdani and sending his political career into retirement.\n\nTRUMP FIRST YEAR REPORT CARD: A- PROMISE KEEPER OR ‘NIGHTMARE’ FAILURE\n\nTrump’s tariffs\n\nTrump won the White House largely because of Biden’s economy. Voters blamed Joe Biden and, by extension, Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, for inflation. They also remembered that Trump’s economy was humming right up until the global pandemic. \n\nBut Trump’s obsession with tariffs is ruining all that GOP goodwill on the economy. Voters still aren’t happy with high prices, with over 70% saying they are paying more for groceries this year than last. Now, 62% of them blame the state of the economy on Trump’s policies, chiefly the tariffs that are keeping costs higher than they otherwise would be. Trump costing the GOP ground on the economy helped sink Virginia Republicans in their 2025 elections, and it will be hanging over Republicans for the 2026 midterm elections so long as Trump continues to make tariffs a focal point of his administration.\n\nThe 2024 Democratic presidential ticket\n\nHarris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, both lost in 2024, but their losing streaks continued into 2025 as well.\n\nHarris’s excuse-ridden book tour has been a flop, where she proved that she still has contempt for Americans as racist bigots. Harris claimed in her book that she did not want to choose then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as her running mate because she thought it would be too much to ask Americans to vote for a black woman (with a Jewish husband) and a gay man on the same ticket.\n\nREPUBLICANS PRAISE TRUMP’S ISIS STRIKES IN NIGERIA: ‘CLEAR AND UNMISTAKABLE MESSAGE’\n\nWalz, meanwhile, has become embroiled in a statewide fraud scandal involving the state’s Somali community. Walz has become the face of government incompetence as his state has been defrauded of hundreds of millions in COVID-19, housing, and autism funds. This comes after months of Walz trying to rebrand himself as a tough guy, promising to fight Trump supporters and promising his own supporters that they can one day celebrate Trump dying.\n\nBoth Harris and Walz missed their chance to go down in history last year, and they have spent this past year proving that their lack of political talent is the only thing to blame.\n\nCalifornia has one bit of good news: 2026 will be Gov. Gavin Newsom’s last year in office. Newsom is term-limited and wants to run for president, where he would export California’s failed policies to the rest of the nation. That is where the good news ends for California.\n\nUnder Newsom’s stewardship, California is facing budget deficits for years into the future. California businesses will now face a new tax on employees as a result of Newsom failing to repay a federal pandemic unemployment loan. California has a looming energy crisis and an ever-worsening affordability crisis. Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass have both failed to rebuild Los Angeles in a timely manner after the city suffered widespread fires in January.\n\nTo top it all off, for anyone who thinks things cannot get worse in California, the top Democrat in polling right now to replace Newsom is the one and only Rep. Eric Swalwell. \n\nLate-night “comedy”\n\nLate-night comedy shows have been a dying format for a decade, driven by alternative media and by the fact that most late night “comedians” were political activists.\n\nTRUMP ORDERS CHRISTMAS DAY US MILITARY STRIKES AGAINST ISIS IN NIGERIA\n\nThe death of late-night comedy accelerated this year. CBS was, for some reason, paying Stephen Colbert a reported $20 million per year for a show that, for some reason, cost $130 million to produce each year. Colbert’s show was losing $40 million per year and was pulling fewer viewers than Greg Gutfeld was pulling on Fox News at a fraction of the cost. Rather than fire Colbert and try to take The Late Show in a different direction, CBS decided it would be easier to cancel the show entirely, with last year being the final one for the franchise that started in 1993.\n\nJimmy Kimmel of ABC then earned himself a short suspension after Charlie Kirk was killed by a left-wing terrorist. Kimmel got on air and lied to his audience, claiming that Trump supporters were “trying to characterize this kid who killed Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.” Kimmel was, of course, feeding into a conspiracy theory that Kirk was shot by some right-wing radical, something he still hasn’t apologized for to this day. Like Colbert, Kimmel has given up on comedy in favor of ranting about fascism, which is what he blamed for his suspension.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

When asked whether she had any doubts about Jeffries leading the chamber, she didn’t hesitate. “None,” she said.\n\nThat’s the Pelosi brand—absolute, unwavering confidence behind a layer of Botox. It sounds decisive, but at this point, it’s mostly theater. She’s just doing what political veterans do best: telling her party what it wants to hear. And let’s face it, that’s what this prediction was.\n\nWe’ve heard it all before. Pelosi said almost the same thing last year when she endorsed Kamala Harris after Joe Biden dropped out.\n\n“Politically, make no mistake: Kamala Harris as a woman in politics is brilliantly astute – and I have full confidence that she will lead us to victory in November,” she said at the time.\n\nIt was obvious that she was projecting. I mean, come on, no one ever used the word “brilliant” to describe Kamala Harris before. And what ultimately happened? Democrats lost the White House, the House, and the Senate.\n\nYet, Pelosi is still out there pretending like projecting confidence will assure the result she wants.\n\nIt wasn’t just Pelosi caught in fantasyland. The supposedly “objective” experts were right there with her. Allan Lichtman, the historian with his much-hyped “Keys to the White House” prediction model, claimed Harris would cruise to victory. His system had been accurate since 1984, which had so many convinced her victory was inevitable. The problem with his model was that many of the keys were subjective, and when I reassessed them, I discovered it actually predicted a Trump victory.\n\nHis “keys” weren’t the problem—his bias was. The man twisted his own model to fit his politics, and it blew up in his face.\n\nAnd then there was famed Democrat consultant James Carville. In an October 2024 op-ed for The New York Times, Carville didn’t just predict a Kamala Harris victory—he guaranteed it. “America, it will all be OK. Ms. Harris will be elected the next president of the United States. Of this, I am certain,” he wrote. Well, America turned out fine, but not because Carville got it right.\n\nThe problem isn’t poor predictions—it’s the arrogance behind them. People in the business of politics live in a bubble that rewards confidence over honesty. They don’t get paid to be right. They get paid to make their side feel hopeful. Pelosi, Carville, Lichtman—take your pick. They’re all part of the same choir, singing as loudly as they can to drown out the sound of political reality.\n\nThe same thing happens on the Republican side, too, and it's just as useless.\n\nCould Democrats win back the House next year? Sure. Heck, history is arguably on their side. But there’s no guarantee. Pelosi doesn’t have insider knowledge about how 2026 will shake out. None of these folks do. What they have is a megaphone and a base that demands reassurance. So they deliver it, every time—facts be damned.\n\nIf there’s one thing voters should have learned by now, it’s to tune out anyone who swears they know what’s coming. Politics is chaos wrapped in ego. Predictions don’t win elections. Voters do. And if history is any guide, the loudest voices in the pundit class will be just as wrong next time, too.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2025/12/28/ignore-election-predictions-and-just-vote-n4947615","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/87/9adfe385-e9df-4f65-a4a6-8775db692117.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-28 18:00:25","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.496},{"id":389679778,"title":"Larry David reunites with Jerry Seinfeld and Julia Louis-Dreyfus in first sighting since Rob Reiner murder","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBlake Lively\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nU.K. Showbiz\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Dec 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne pilot killed and another critically injured after helicopter plunges out of the sky following midair collision\n\nDonald Trump meets with Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago as president snaps at reporter: 'What a stupid question'\n\nFBI gives update on daycare accused of $4MILLION taxpayer fraud as Kash Patel says it's the 'tip of the iceberg' and vows to 'follow the money and protect children'\n\nSnorting cocaine on the floor, cuckolding JFK Jr and the day Carolyn Bessette humiliated herself at Mar-a-Lago: Every poisonous detail, told by friends and family\n\nSARAH VINE: The miasma of gloom has finally lifted over the royals.

'He saw something no one else could.' \n\n Billy Crystal breaks silence after racing to Rob Reiner's home to find unimaginable horror \n'When nobody at the network liked the early episodes, he saved us from cancellation,' Seinfeld said. \nHe concluded his post by writing the death of Rob and his wife is 'impossibly sad.' \nEarlier this month, Crystal, David, Martin Short, and several other close friends and prominent figures released a joint statement memorializing Rob to The Associated Press.\n'Going to the movies in a dark theater filled with strangers having a common experience, laughing, crying, screaming in fear, or watching an intense drama unfold is still an unforgettable thrill. Tell us a story audiences demand of us. Absorbing all he had learned from his father Carl and his mentor Norman Lear, Rob Reiner not only was a great comic actor, he became a master story teller,' the statement read.\n'There is no other director who has his range. From comedy to drama to 'mockumentary' to documentary he was always at the top of his game. He charmed audiences. They trusted him. They lined up to see his films.'\nCrystal was seen leaving the Reiners' home late Sunday, not long after their bodies had been discovered.\n\nView gallery\n\nThe reunion marked David's first public appearance since the recent deaths of his close friends Rob Reiner and Michele Reiner, who were murdered earlier this month; seen in 2019\n\nReiner was also a longtime friend and collaborator of David, having produced Seinfeld and later appearing as an exaggerated version of himself on Curb Your Enthusiasm.\nAlong with David and Crystal and their wives, the statement was issued on behalf of Martin Short, Albert Brooks, Kimberly Brooks, Alan Zweibel, Robin Zweibel, Marc Shaiman, Lou Mirabal, Barry Levinson, Diana Levinson, James Costos and Michael Smith.\n'His comedic touch was beyond compare, his love of getting the music of the dialogue just right, and his sharpening of the edge of a drama was simply elegant,' the statement continued. 'For the actors, he loved them. For the writers, he made them better.'\n'His greatest gift was freedom. If you had an idea, he listened, he brought you into the process. They always felt they were working as a team. To be in his hands as a filmmaker was a privilege but that is only part of his legacy.'\nThe group also paid tribute to the Reiners' political work, noting that the couple were longtime Democratic backers whose advocacy earned them admiration across the progressive community.\n\nView gallery\n\nIn his tribute to Rob, Seinfeld credited the late actor-director for having 'the biggest influence' next to David and George Shapiro; Seinfeld and Rob Reiner seen in 2000\n\nView gallery\n\n'Our show would have never happened without him,' Seinfeld said. 'He saw something no one else could' (L-R) Seinfeld, Albert Brooks, Reiner and David pictured at a 2003 event in LA \n'Rob was also a passionate, brave citizen, who not only cared for this country he loved, he did everything he could to make it better and with his loving wife Michele, he had the perfect partner. Strong and determined, Michele and Rob Reiner devoted a great deal of their lives for the betterment of our fellow citizens,' the statement said.\n'They were a special force together — dynamic, unselfish and inspiring. We were their friends, and we will miss them forever.'\nThe statement concluded with a line from one of Reiner's favorite films, It's a Wonderful Life: 'Each man's life touches so many other lives, and when he isn't around, he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he? You have no idea.'\nReiner and Crystal had a decades-long friendship as they first met on the set of classic sitcom All In The Family in 1975 when the two were cast as best friends.\nIn 2016, Crystal reflected on their closeness in a column for The Hollywood Reporter and explained that their chemistry on screen was so palpable, they decided to be friends away from the camera.\n'We became the closest of friends. And when I moved out here (from New York), we just spent all kinds of time together,' he said.\nTheir most famous collaboration was the 1989 classic When Harry Met Sally in which Crystal starred with Meg Ryan in a romantic comedy penned by the late Nora Ephron.\n\nView gallery\n\nDavid and Billy Crystal were among those who visited the Reiners' home shortly after the couple were discovered murdered, according to reports at the time; Reiner and Crystal seen in September 2025\nCrystal shared that one of his favorite moments in their friendship was at the first screening of the movie: 'Rob and I were sitting in the back next to each other. Then the orgasm scene happens, and the place goes berserk. When Rob's mother, Estelle, says, 'I'll have what she's having,' it was thunderous, a laugh you can only hear with the best of jokes in a concert hall.'\n'It's those moments that make movies so spectacular: You set up the joke in September, and you don't hear the punch line until May. We just grabbed each other's hands because we knew something exciting was about to happen with this movie.'\nThe Hollywood director and his wife were knifed to death between Saturday night and 3.30pm Sunday, when their daughter Romy stumbled into the grim scene after going to check on them at their LA home.\nTheir throats had been cut and they may have been asleep in their bed when they were murdered, a source close to the investigation claimed to the Daily Mail.\nThe couple's son Nick was later arrested after reports stated he had been 'acting crazy' at a holiday party he attended with his parents on Saturday.\nAlthough he has been formally charged with the violent slayings of his mother and father, Nick has yet to be arraigned in court on the charges, which carry a maximum sentence of life in prison without possibility of parole or the death penalty.\nLos Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said no decision had been made yet whether prosecutors will seek the death penalty.\n\nView gallery\n\nReiner's son Nick, 32, who has a history of drug addiction and difficult behavior, has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the slaying of his parents; pictured with dad Rob in 2016\n\nNick's lawyer Alan Jackson said his client had not been medically cleared to be transferred from the jail to the courthouse, but did not disclose any further details about his condition or the case, according to the New York Times.\nNick currently remains in jail without bail and is being held on suicide watch in administrative segregation at Twin Towers Correctional Facility in Los Angeles.\nAt the time of Nick's arrest, his sister Romy allegedly told investigators her brother 'should be a suspect' because he was 'dangerous'.\nCurb Your Enthusiasm and writer of Seinfeld, Larry David, was also spotted close to the Reiners' home on Sunday evening after the news broke about their deaths.\nReiner famously worked with David on his iconic sitcom Curb Your Enthusiasm as he played himself in one of the best-known episodes, titled The Thong, which was broadcast in October 2001.\nThe two are both legends in the comedy world, with Reiner having directed some of the most iconic films of the genre and David being a comedic force behind Seinfeld and his aforementioned HBO series.\n\nView gallery\n\nReiner and his wife had three children, Nick (not pictured), Jake (left) and Romy (second to left); pictured together in January 2024 in LA\nIn September, Reiner released Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, the sequel to his iconic 1984 mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, which he co-wrote, directed and appeared in.\nReiner followed his father, the comic actor and filmmaker Carl Reiner, into Hollywood. Reiner died in 2020 at 98.\nReiner first emerged as an actor and is best known for his role as Michael 'Meathead' Stivic on the previously mentioned All In The Family.\nHe won two Emmy Awards and was nominated for five Golden Globes during his stint on the series from 1971 to 1978.\nReiner helped reinvent his career in the 1980s with his forward-looking comedy This Is Spinal Tap, which would go on to inspire countless mockumentaries.\nHe became one of Hollywood's most in-demand directors for the next two decades due to classics and box office hits such as Stand By Me (1986), The Princess Bride (1987), Misery (1990), A Few Good Men (1992), The American President (1995) and The Bucket List (2007).\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLarry David reunites with Jerry Seinfeld and Julia Louis-Dreyfus in first sighting since Rob Reiner murder\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nRedemption for Jake Paul's fiancee as Dutch speed skater bounces back after heartbreaking fall at Olympic trials\n\nUS soccer superstar Christian Pulisic breaks his silence on Sydney Sweeney dating rumors\n\nEXCLUSIVENashville's brutal secret RANKING of influencers: From the 'cougar'... to the star with an ugly nickname\n\nBristol Palin reunites with son Tripp for his 17th birthday after he moved to Alaska to live with his dad\n\nLarry David reunites with sitcom icons Jerry Seinfeld and Julia Louis-Dreyfus in first sighting since Rob Reiner murder\n\nWhy we are crushing on retro!

Perhaps the most high-profile person to depart, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, announced her intention in November not just to retire but to resign from Congress entirely on Jan. 5 – a full year before her term was set to expire.\n\nThere are political dynamics that explain this rush to the exits, including frustrations with gridlock and President Donald Trump’s lackluster approval ratings, which could hurt Republicans at the ballot box.\n\nRather than get swept away by a prospective “blue wave” favoring Democrats – or possibly daunted by the monumental effort it would take to survive – many Republicans have decided to fold up the beach chair and head home before the wave crashes.\n\nAs of now, two dozen Republican House members have either resigned from the House or announced their intent to not run for reelection in 2026. With only two exceptions – Republicans in 2018 and 2020 – this is more departures from either party at this point in the election calendar than any other cycle over the past 20 years.\n\nThere is also growing concern within the House Republican caucus that Greene’s announcement is a canary in the coal mine and that multiple resignations will follow.\n\nAs a political scientist who studies Congress and politicians’ reelection strategies, I’m not surprised to see many House members leaving ahead of what’s shaping up to be a difficult midterm for the GOP. Still, the sheer numbers of people not running tells us something about broader dissatisfaction with Washington.\n\nWhy do members leave Congress?\n\nMany planned departures are true retirements involving older and more experienced members. \n\nFor example, 78-year-old Democratic congressman Jerry Nadler is retiring after 34 years, following mounting pressure from upstart challengers and a growing consensus among Democrats that it’s time for older politicians to step aside. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker who will turn 86 in March, is also retiring.\n\nSometimes, members of Congress depart for the same reasons other workers might leave any job. Like many Americans, members of Congress might find something more attractive elsewhere. Retiring members are attractive hires for lobbying firms and corporations, thanks to their insider knowledge and connections within the institution. These firms usually offer much higher salaries than members are used to in Congress, which may explain why more than half of all living former members are lobbyists of some kind.\n\nOther members remain ambitious for elective office and decide to use their position in Congress as a springboard for another position. Members of the House regularly retire to run for a Senate seat, such as, in this cycle, Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan. Others run for executive offices, including governor, such as Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina. \n\nBut some are leaving Congress due to growing frustration with the job and an inability to get things done. Specifically, many retiring members cite growing dysfunction within their own party, or in Congress as a whole, as the reason they’re moving on. \n\nIn a statement announcing his departure in June, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., mused that “between spending another six years navigating the political theater and partisan gridlock in Washington or spending that time with my family,” it was “not a hard choice” to leave the Senate.\n\nWhat’s unique about 2026?\n\nIn addition, there are a few other factors that can help explain why so many Republicans in particular are heading for the exits leading up to 2026.\n\nThe shifting of boundaries that has come with the mid-decade redistricting process in several states this year has scrambled members’ priorities. Unfamiliar districts can drive incumbents to early retirement by severing their connection with well-established constituencies. \n\nIn Texas, six Republicans and three Democrats – nearly a quarter of the state’s entire House delegation – are either retiring or running for other offices, due in part to that state’s new gerrymander for 2026.\n\nAll decisions about retirement and reelection are sifted through the filter of electoral and partisan considerations. A phenomenon called “thermostatic politics” predicts that parties currently in power, particularly in the White House, tend to face a backlash from voters in the following election. In other words, the president’s party nearly always loses seats in midterms.\n\nIn 2006 and 2018, for example, Republican members of Congress were weighed down by the reputations of unpopular Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Trump. Republicans had arguably even greater success in midterm elections during Barack Obama’s presidency.\n\nCurrently, 2026 looks like it will present a poor national environment for Republicans. Trump remains highly unpopular, according to polls, and Democrats are opening up a consistent lead in the “generic ballot” question, which asks respondents which party they intend to support in the 2026 midterms without reference to individual candidates. \n\nDemocrats have already been overperforming in special elections, as well as the general election in November in states such as New Jersey and Virginia, which held elections for governor. Democrats are on average running 13 points ahead of Kamala Harris’ performance in the 2024 election.\n\nAs a result, even Republicans in districts thought to be safe for their party may see themselves in enough potential danger to abandon the fight in advance.\n\nRetirement vs. resignation\n\nOne final, unique aspect of this election cycle with major consequences is not an electoral but an institutional one. \n\nHouse conservatives are quietly revolting against Speaker Mike Johnson’s leadership style. That members may be frustrated enough not just to retire but resign in advance, leaving their seats temporarily vacant, is a notable sign of dysfunction in the U.S. House. \n\nThis also could have a major impact on policy, given how slim the Republicans’ majority in the lower chamber is already. Whatever the outcome of the midterms in November, these departures clearly matter in Washington and offer important signals about the chaos in Congress.\n\nCharlie Hunt, Associate Professor of Political Science, Boise State University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

We're not doing this.\" I was so mad, so mad,' she said on the Sex, Lies, And Spray Tans podcast with Cheryl Burke. \n\nView gallery\n\nIn text added over the reel, Palin typed out, 'happiest 17th birthday to my @tripp.easton!!!'\n\nView gallery\n\nThe public speaker shares her son (seen in a throwback photo) with ex Levi Johnston - whom she previously had an on-and-off engagement to until their final split in 2010\n\nView gallery\n\nThe special reunion comes a little over one year since she announced that Tripp had made the decision to move to Alaska to reside with his father and finish out his high school years there as well\nThe star emotionally expressed how 'gut wrenching' it was to her as she opened up about the close bond she has with her son. \n'It's been just Tripp and I, and then I had my girls, but it's always been Tripp and I. It's changed the dynamic of so much.'\nPalin had been 18-years-old when she welcomed Tripp to the world. \nHer pregnancy had been publicly announced at the 2008 Republican National Convention when her mother Sarah Palin was running as vice presidential nominee.\nAfter her separation from Johnston, the pair entered a lengthy custody battle - which came to an end in 2016 with the pair gaining joint custody of Tripp. \nThe daughter of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin later tied the knot with Dakota Meyer in 2016, but their divorce was finalized two years later. \nBack in July of this year, Palin also revealed whether her son has plans to attend college after his high school graduation. \nDuring an Instagram Q+A session at the time, a follower questioned whether the teen is interested in going to university to which she wrote in response, 'I'd never push college.' \n\nBristol Palin shares son Tripp's plans for the future\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:32\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nView gallery\n\n'He just texted me and was like, \"Hey Mom, I'm not coming back.\" At first I'm like, \"I'm coming up to Alaska.

Somehow, it’s always “cheating” when Republicans do it, but it’s fair game when Democrats do it.\n\nThat was the message from left-wing political consultant Tezlyn Figaro on CNN’s NewsNight on Friday, and she wasn’t even being subtle about it. According to Figaro, cheating only exists as a political concept when Republicans do it. When Democrats engage in the same behavior, it magically transforms into something noble, defensive, and totally justified.\n\nFigaro opened with a sweeping declaration that left no room for nuance or evidence. “And one would argue that if Republicans can’t win in Texas, they cheat,” she said. “If Republicans can’t win, they cheat. They cheat. They cheat by changing the maps.”\n\nFrom her perspective, Republicans lose elections. Republicans respond by cheating. Case closed. That’s when Scott Jennings jumped in.\n\n“So, you’re saying it was illegal in what they did?” he asked.\n\n“Well, one would argue that,” Figaro insisted. “That’s why they put the whole lawsuit piece up.”\n\nJennings kept going because that is what happens when someone uses the word “cheating” in a legal context. He asked whether the same logic applied elsewhere. “Is it illegal in Illinois?”\n\n“It could be too,” Figaro replied.\n\n“Is it illegal in Democrat states?” Jennings asked.\n\n“It could be, yes. It could be.”\n\n“So, you’re saying the entire political system is just cheating?”\n\nHere’s where Figaro showed what she really meant. “No, that’s not what I said. I said if Republicans can’t win, they cheat. Not the entire political system, just Republicans. But it’s okay.”\n\nThere it was. Just Republicans cheat. And not just by redistricting… but by appointing judges too. Figaro spiraled into a Kamala Harris-esque word salad about courts, lawsuits, and Donald Trump secretly running the judiciary. “Will it survive court challenge because it was Trump’s folks in the court. He runs the court system as well. That’s also called cheating.”\n\nICYMI: How Long Before Tim Walz Is Indicted?\n\nIn other words, Republicans cheat by redistricting. Republicans cheat by appointing judges. Republicans cheat by winning court cases. Democrats file lawsuits forever because, you know… Virtue! Democracy!\n\nEven CNN host Abby Phillip gently pointed out the obvious: “I mean Democrats are also doing now the same thing Republicans are doing with these —”\n\n“What Newsom did, yes,” Figaro jumped in.\n\nJennings went for the kill shot: “Was it cheating in California?”\n\n“It’s fire for fire,” Figaro said.\n\nJennings, refusing to let her dodge, asked again: “Is it cheating?”\n\n“It’s responding,” she replied.\n\n“You said he’s cheating.”\n\n“You could call it cheating if that’s what you want to call it.”\n\nJennings finally translated her argument into plain English: “So, it’s cheating for Republicans and it’s okay for Democrat.”\n\nFigaro protested, then immediately proved his point: “I said that if Republicans can’t win, they cheat. And so what Newsom did is, he countered that. He countered it, whatever you want to call it. He countered cheating.”\n\nThat is the left’s worldview in a nutshell. Republican actions equal cheating by definition. Democrat actions equal counter-cheating. The rules stay the same. The judgment changes based on party.\n\nJennings summed it up with visible exasperation: “You’re talking in circles again. Are you dizzy?”\n\n🚨 HOLY CRAP! Scott Jennings EMBARRASSES liberal on CNN who whines Republicans are \"CHEATING\" by redistricting for 2026\"You talk in CIRCLES, are you DIZZY!?\" 🤣LIB: If Republicans can't win Texas, they cheat!SCOTT: How? So you're saying it was illegal what they did in… pic.twitter.com/MGqaofRFjL— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) December 27, 2025\n\nThis is no different than Democrats abusing the filibuster when they were in the minority, calling it a critical tool to protect the minority party. Then, when Republicans responded in kind, Democrats nuked the filibuster. Time and again, Democrats make it clear that they judge the morality and legality of the system based on whether it benefits them at a particular moment. Power matters more than consistency. For Democrats, the moral compass only points in their direction.\n\nThis holiday season, support fearless journalism that exposes the Left and tells the stories legacy media bury.

'I don't want to say the L word, but it feels like the L word.'\nThe source added that Braun has become a grounding presence amid Sweeney's skyrocketing fame, describing him as an 'old soul' who offers guidance as her career continues to explode.\nThe duo were first linked over the summer after crossing paths at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's lavish wedding, months after Sweeney ended her engagement to longtime fiancé Jonathan Davino. \nWhile early reports suggested the two were 'casually dating,' their increasingly public appearances suggest the connection may be more serious than initially believed.\nA source told Entertainment Tonight that both Sweeney and Braun are keeping their relationship 'low-key.' \n'They were both overwhelmed by the backlash they received from news of them dating coming out. They thought the hate was blown out of proportion,' the insider said.\nIn September, the couple were seen holding hands as they had a blast during Horror Nights at Universal Studios in Hollywood.\n'The attraction is she is hot as can be,' an insider told the Daily Mail. 'He gives great advice. They have what each other wants.'\n\nView gallery\n\nInsiders recently told The Daily Mail that the pair's romance has escalated quickly behind the scenes \nSince going public with their romance, Sweeney and Braun have been spotted enjoying dates together across the country.\nEarlier this month, the two stars held hands during an excursion in New York City - shortly after her 'screaming' fight with ex-fiancé Jonathan.\nSweeney raised eyebrows after she was seen quietly slipping into a car with her ex-fiancé in Los Angeles. \nPhotographs captured the two-time Emmy nominee ducking down in the passenger seat with Davino behind the wheel.\nBut their apparent amiability seemed short-lived. TMZ reported that, at one point, the star screamed: 'I don't believe you. Please leave, leave me alone.'\nThe former couple called off their engagement, earlier this year, after about seven years together. \nEllie Goulding and Beau Minniear \n\nView gallery\n\nActor Beau, 28, and Ellie confirmed they were dating earlier this year, as their unlikely romance was revealed \nActor Beau, 28, and Ellie confirmed they were dating earlier this year, as their unlikely romance was revealed. \nRecently the singer, 38, revealed she was pregnant as she showed off her baby bump at the Fashion Awards in London.\nSoon after, The Daily Mail then exclusively revealed that in 2018, aged 20, Beau was arrested in Palm Beach, Florida, where he was living at the time. \nThe incident led to him being charged with three offences: robbery without a firearm, felony battery resulting in a serious bodily injury, and marijuana possession.\nAccording to documents filed by the West Palm Beach Police Department, Beau and two other young men were taken into custody after an altercation on a street at around 2.30am.\nA 36-year-old man claimed to have been kicked and punched multiple times by a group of attackers, while lying on the ground, leaving him with a fractured elbow and bleeding nose.\nAccording to the police records, he claimed that they also ripped off his trousers and stole his wallet, which was found in the possession of one of the men Beau was with when they were arrested.\n\nView gallery\n\nRecently the singer, 38, revealed she was pregnant as she showed off her baby bump at the Fashion Awards in London \nAccording to address details filed with the police, the victim – who also has a criminal record – was homeless at the time.\nIn a mugshot taken after his arrest, Beau, dressed in a blue-and-purple plaid shirt, looks downcast and remorseful, his hair hanging greasily over his forehead. He was the only one in the group charged with a drugs offence, having been found with seven grams of marijuana in his pockets.\nHaving served two days behind bars at the County Jail, Beau admitted misdemeanour battery, a lesser offence than felony battery, as part of an apparent plea deal.\nAppearing in front of a jury in November 2018, he was granted probation and ordered to pay $675 (£500) in costs.\nHe also had to complete a 12-hour online anger management course, and was ordered to do 75 hours of community service at a minimum of ten hours per month over the following year.\nThis wasn't, however, Beau's last brush with the law.\nIn 2020, during the Black Lives Matter riots in Los Angeles – two days of unrest sparked by the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota – he was arrested again.\n\nView gallery\n\nBeau appears in several raunchy scenes in Ellie's latest music video, Destiny\nAlong with 4,000 others, the then 23-year-old was taken into custody for breaching the 8pm curfew that had been imposed on the city to quell the violence. No further action appears to have been taken, and he was apparently released without charge.\nGiven that Ellie is expecting his first child, one must presume that Beau has told her about his chequered past.\nThe singer split from her husband Caspar Jopling, with whom she shares a four-year-old son, Arthur, in February last year. Since her relationship with Beau went public in September, the pair have holidayed together in Italy, where Beau shared online an intimate photograph of Ellie lying in an unmade hotel room bed.\nHe also appears in several raunchy scenes in Ellie's latest music video, Destiny.\nIn one, the pair passionately kiss while wearing veils over their heads; in another Ellie takes pictures of Beau's semi-naked body before straddling him. She playfully captioned a behind-the-scenes clip on her TikTok profile: 'Bring your bf [boyfriend] to work day,' adding: 'He upstaged me tbh [to be honest].'\nIt marks quite the change for the British songstress, who just six years ago married Eton-educated art dealer Caspar in a fairytale ceremony at York Minster.\nIn attendance were Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, long-term friends of Ellie – who is also close to Prince William and Prince Harry, with whom she was once romantically linked.\nEllie broke her silence on her pregnancy and gushed that she felt 'empowered and my absolute best' on Wednesday after her surprise bump reveal. \nShe showed off her growing bump in an outfit from designer Willy Chavarria and announced her happy news.\nIn her first Instagram post since the reveal, she shared a series of photos from the night. \nThe hitmaker wrote: 'So grateful to have attended the Fashion Awards with the visionary Willy Chavarria, wearing a look that was a little bit custom, a little bit archive. \n'Only on a night like this, could Willy be the one to empower me and make me feel my absolute bestttt.'\nEllie added: 'Thank you for a night filled with meaning, beauty, and so much heart x.' \nShailene Woodley and Lucas Bravo \n\nView gallery\n\nShailene and Lucas seemed an unlikely pairing when it was revealed that they'd started dating earlier this year \nShailene and Lucas seemed an unlikely pairing when it was revealed that they'd started dating earlier this year.\nThe Emily In Paris hunk, 37, and the actress, 34, was first spotted together in Paris this past March.\nAt the time, they were spotted canoodling on the France set of Lucas' show Emily in Paris. \nThat same month a source told People that their romance was 'a breath of fresh air for her.'\nThe person also described Lucas as 'uncomplicated, kind, not pretentious and emotionally present.'\n'Her friends love him,' the insider emphasized, noting that the Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox star was 'thriving.'\n'It's a whole new vibe,' the source shared, later comparing Shailene's new love to her former flame Aaron Rodgers.\n'It's the total opposite of her dynamic with Aaron. She's happy, light and having fun again,' the person close to the situation said. \nThe Tell Me Lies actress and Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback were romantically involved from 2020 to 2022.\nThey eventually broke off their engagement, leaving Shailene 'heartbroken.'\nIn a subsequent interview with Bustle in 2024, she cryptically said, 'I fell in love over and over with unavailability.'\nHowever in September it was reported that Shailene and Lucas had split after their six-month relationship.\nThey have since wiped their respective Instagram profiles clean of each other, after previously going 'official' on the app in late April.\nDaily Mail reached out to the stars' reps for comment at the time.\nCurtis Pritchard and Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu\n\nView gallery\n\nCurtis and Ekin-Su met on the 2025 Love Island: All Stars series and made it very close to the end of the show \n\nView gallery\n\nThings sadly ended just three months after the South African season wrapped \n\nSam Thompson addresses his difficult year following split from Zara\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:34\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nCurtis and Ekin-Su met on the 2025 Love Island: All Stars series and made it very close to the end of the show.\nThings sadly ended just three months after the South African season wrapped.\nCurtis, whose brother is former Strictly star AJ Pritchard, first appeared on Love Island in 2019, where he met ex-girlfriend Maura Higgins. \nHe returned earlier this year for Love Island: All Stars, dating Ekin-Su until their split in July, and has not been linked to anyone since.\nAnnouncing the split on Instagram, she wrote: 'I wanted to share that Curtis and I have decided to go our separate ways. \n'It's been a really tough decision, but one made with a lot of love and respect for one another.\n'He's an incredible person and I'll always cherish the memories we made both in an out of the villa.'\nAt the time many fans branded them a showmance and said they seemed a very unlikely pair. \nIt came following her split from her boyfriend Davide before going on to have a rocky stint in Celebrity Big Brother. \nThe couple had a turbulent 18-month relationship since they first met in the Love Island villa in 2022, going on to win the show's £50,000 prize money together.\nZara McDermott and Louis Tomlinson \n\nView gallery\n\nZara and Louis began dating early this year after her split from Sam Thompson\nZara and Louis began dating early this year after her split from Sam Thompson. \nZara and Sam dated for around five years - with the pair going official in May 2019 and later splitting in December 2024.\nZara and Louis will spend Christmas together with his family as their relationship goes from strength to strength. \n\n Zara McDermott will spend Christmas with boyfriend Louis Tomlinson and his family as their relationship grows 'very serious' \nLouis' twin sisters Daisy and Phoebe, 21, recently revealed they are having their 'biggest Christmas', after the singer, 33, invited Zara, 28, to the celebrations. \nThey said in their podcast: 'This is a big Christmas this year. It might be our biggest Christmas. Everyone is coming.\n'The new baby this year is Flossy [Lottie's second child with fiancé Lewis Burton] as she was born in January, so we already have a new member.\n'And we've got another new member as our brother's got a new girlfriend so that will be nice. I think there will be 16 of us in total.'\nLast month Zara and Louis made a rare joint appearance at the Grand Prix in Paradise, Nevada. \nIt came after it was reported Zara moved into multi-millionaire Louis's north London mansion, having moved back into her parents' house after leaving the home she shared with ex Sam.\nOf their latest plans, a source told The Sun: 'Louis and Zara are still totally in the honeymoon period and try not to be apart for too long. Their relationship is serious, it's not a flash in the pan. It's going the distance. Zara gets on so well with Louis' family, especially his sisters, so he wanted her to be there with them, celebrating.\n'They've both had work commitments recently so they're looking forward to spending proper quality time together.' \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe WEIRDEST celebrity relationships of 2025 from Chris Hughes and JoJo Siwa to Billy Ray Cyrus and Elizabeth Hurley and Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (23)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nJfJimbo from Glasgow , Charleston WV , United States, 29 minutes ago\n\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\n\nCyrus looks ridiculous with that hair.\n\nClick to rate\n\nHHappy_2026, north east, United Kingdom, 29 minutes ago\n\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\n\nZara was already a friend of the Tomlinson girls so I think Louis was just waiting for her to leave Sam !! \n\nClick to rate\n\nHHappy_2026, north east, United Kingdom, 31 minutes ago\n\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\n\nLiz and Billy are fabulous - obviously crazy in love ! \n\nClick to rate\n\nShow 20 More Comments\nThe opinions and views expressed in the comments section are solely those of the individual users and do not represent or reflect the opinions, views, or positions of Daily Mail.

The closely watched decisions from former Vice President Kamala Harris and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla have been made.\n\nDoes that mean the race for California’s next governor — with its primary just six months away — is ready to heat up?\n\nIt’s been a rather lackluster campaign thus far. One that, while it certainly is not wanting for candidates, has lacked a certain excitement.\n\nThat’s in part due to the Proposition 50 special election that stole the political attention in the latter part of 2025. But a missing star power in the race to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom has also contributed to what political experts have considered to be a relatively dull gubernatorial campaign.\n\n“It’s an open race,” said Matt Lesenyie, who teaches political science at Cal State Long Beach. “No big splashes so far.”\n\nAlready, as 2025 comes to a close, a few of the crowded field of Democratic contenders to succeed Newsom have begun to drop out of the race.\n\nThose left include former U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond and former State Controller Betty Yee, all of whom have experience in California’s executive branch.\n\nThere’s former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who once served as an advisor to Newsom, and billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, whose money will enable him to put his face and name before voters, perhaps a bit more easily.\n\nAnd then there are Rep. Eric Swalwell and former Rep. Katie Porter, both bringing congressional expertise to the race as well as an affinity for cable television appearances.\n\nAs for the Republicans, both Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News host Steve Hilton have found a path toward the top of recent polls — polls that, notably, show the undecided category still the most popular choice for those surveyed.\n\nThere’s also the possibility that Attorney General Rob Bonta or billionaire businessman Rick Caruso could jump into the fray as well. And while their presence certainly wouldn’t shake up the campaign with the same weight that Harris or Padilla would have, politicos watching California’s gubernatorial race believe they could still make some difference.\n\nSo no, the race for California governor isn’t lonely. Just lackluster — and that is odd.\n\n“What’s notable about this race is how extraordinarily unsettled it is,” said Dan Schnur, who teaches political messaging at USC and UC Berkeley.\n\n“There hasn’t been a campaign for California governor in modern political history that has been so open-ended at this stage,” Schnur said.\n\nSen. Tony Strickland, R-Huntington Beach, agrees.\n\n“This is the first time I can recall that there’s not a clear-cut frontrunner,” Strickland said.\n\nHow will that change in 2026?\n\nLesenyie expects the field to winnow a bit more: “Campaigns are expensive, poll results and donor energy will dictate these withdrawals.”\n\nHe also believes cost of living will be the issue that really drives the campaign in 2026.\n\n“In the 2022 gubernatorial … this manifested as a ‘homelessness crisis,’ which is true, but retrospectively is also a proxy for cost of living,” Lesenyie said. “I’d expect the issue framing to tie to retail goods, rent and housing stock.”\n\nStrickland, meanwhile, said candidates on either side of the aisle who focus on affordability and public safety could set themselves apart. And for him, that also means looking critically at the money California is spending on certain projects, like the high-speed rail project that was billed, years ago, as a train that would quickly connect Los Angeles, the Central Valley, San Francisco and other communities.\n\nGiven, in particular, the lack of a strong frontrunner on the Democratic side at this point in the race, Strickland sees the possibility for a Republican to make it through the June primary.\n\nThat’s not unheard of in modern elections in a California where the latest data shows 44.93% of voters are registered Democrats, while only 25.22% are Republicans and 22.6% are no party preference. In the race for an open U.S. Senate seat in California in 2024, Republican Steve Garvey advanced to the general election with then-Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat who ultimately won in a landslide.\n\n“I’ve always said the Democrats have to make some mistakes and a Republican has to run a perfect campaign,” Strickland, who has endorsed Hilton for governor, said. “But I don’t think it’s as insurmountable as other people say.”\n\nBut Stephen Cloobeck, a businessman who was running for California governor but ended his campaign in November, said the recent redistricting campaign foreshadows that it will be a Democrat who prevails in the race, despite the uncertainty now.\n\nStatewide, 64.4% of those who voted in the special election agreed to Proposition 50, the redistricting proposal backed by Newsom and other Democrats who marketed it as a referendum on President Donald Trump and his efforts to shore up more congressional seats for Republicans in the 2026 midterms. Only 35.6% of the 11.5 million people who cast ballots opposed redistricting.\n\n“If you do the math, it’s undeniable,” said Cloobeck, who is backing Swalwell in the race. “Trump can’t spend enough money in California to elect a Republican governor. It can’t happen.”\n\nIn the meantime, Schnur, who has worked on multiple presidential and gubernatorial campaigns, likens the current field of chief executive hopefuls to “a political moshpit.”\n\n“There are too many candidates to keep track of, and they’re all trying to climb over each other and just keep getting pulled back down with the rest of them,” he said.\n\n“Once we move into the election year on the calendar, it becomes slightly easier to get the voters’ attention, but there is no guarantee with all this multi-candidate infighting all the way through the primary.”\n\nIn other words, the race for California governor is still very much unsettled.","summary":"While the campaign certainly hasn't lacked candidates, it has been missing star power.

Kennedy hangs in the hallway.\n\n\"Dear Kathleen, as the oldest of the Kennedy grandchildren you have a special responsibility: Be kind to others and work for your country,” RFK wrote his 12-year-old daughter, two days after the assassination of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, in 1963.\n\nFor members of the Kennedy clan, that sense of responsibility is being tested by one of their own: Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Townsend's younger brother and a top member of President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\n“I would not say there’s a lot of peace in my family,” she said, alluding to the tragedies and scandals that have preyed on the Kennedy dynasty, including the assassination of her own father in 1968 while running for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThat's certainly been true in 2025, the 100th anniversary of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy’s birth, which saw his namesake accused of spreading vaccine conspiracies and groping a babysitter during a televised Senate confirmation hearing, the release of government files on the JFK and RFK assassinations, and mass firings and scientific turmoil at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTownsend, 74, the oldest grandchild of the Kennedy family matriarch Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy and power broker Joseph Kennedy, is unassuming and friendly. She often puts her arm on the shoulder of a reporter as she offers explanations of framed letters and memorabilia lining her long entryway.\n\nThere’s a large red leather swivel chair in the study that her father sat in when he was the U.S. attorney general. Townsend encourages the visitor to sit and get a feel for the well-worn chair.\n\nCall it the Kennedy magic. The ability to connect with people that has kept America’s most storied political family at the heart its politics for more than half of its 250-year history.\n\nThe clan experienced a generational handoff after Sen. Ted Kennedy, the youngest sibling of JFK and RFK, died in 2009 while in his 47th year serving in the Senate. RFK's oldest son, Joseph Kennedy II, a former congressman, declined to run for the ensuing open Massachusetts Senate seat. His son, Joseph P. Kennedy III– RFK's grandson – served in Congress for four terms but gave up his seat to unsuccessfully run in the Democratic Senate primary in Massachusetts in 2020. There has been no Kennedy in Congress since then.\n\nNow, the Kennedy name is back, but in a manner that has horrified most members of an extended brood that maintains deep and historic ties to the Democratic party. In April 2023, RFK Jr. launched a long-shot Democratic primary challenge against then-President Joe Biden. Six months later, he was running for the White House as an independent before ultimately abandoning his campaign to endorse Trump, the Republican nominee.\n\nAfter Trump's election, RFK Jr. joined the new Cabinet and rolled out a slew of controversial actions as part of his Make America Healthy Again platform. Multiple Kennedy family members have called their relative out as complicit in “cruel” policies of the Trump administration. There have been newspaper opinion pieces, magazine articles and letters to senators from the family warning against RFK Jr.’s qualifications, character and policies.\n\nIt’s not just MAHA. The family has been buffeted by the release of the JFK and RFK assassination files, while seeing the Kennedy legacy diluted as Trump leveled former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy's garden during his demolition of the East Wing and renamed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington as the \"Trump-Kennedy Center.”\n\nMaria Shriver, a niece of RFK and JFK, said in a post on X it was “beyond comprehension” that Trump had sought to “rename this great memorial dedicated to President Kennedy.\"\n\nDuring an interview with CBS, RFK’s grandson, Joseph Kennedy III, panned Trump’s renaming a “living memorial to a fallen president” like it was a New York City skyscraper.\n\nThe year drew to a close with a millennial member of the Kennedy family, Jack Schlossberg - grandson of JFK and an ardent critic of RFK Jr. - announcing a run for an open U.S. House seat from Manhattan.\n\n“SEND ME TO CONGRESS TO SMOKE THESE FOOLS- MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR I won’t back down or be drowned out,\" Schlossberg wrote Dec. 18 on social media.\n\n'No Irish need apply'\n\nRose Fitzgerald Kennedy’s father, John \"Honey Fitz\" Fitzgerald, was elected as a U.S. congressman from Massachusetts in 1894 and later became Boston’s first Irish-American mayor.\n\n“I spent a lot of time with my grandmother, Rose Kennedy,” says Townsend. “And she would talk about how when she was growing up, there were signs still – even though her father was the mayor of Boston – that said, 'Help wanted - no Irish need apply.'”\n\n“And I think that she passed that on to her children as well,” Townsend said of her privileged family. “What injustice feels like.”\n\nThe Kennedy legacy that Rose Kennedy helped forge with her husband continues to shape American politics.\n\nIt’s that sense of justice that led JFK to initiate the push for a bill aimed at ending discriminatory quotas and a preference for northern Europeans, says Townsend. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1965, two years after Kennedy's assassination. Ted Kennedy, who won a special election in 1962 to fill the seat his brother vacated to become president, championed it in Congress.\n\nFredrik Logevall, a professor of history at Harvard University, is writing a multi-volume biography of John F. Kennedy. He said part of the reason the Kennedys are such an extraordinary American story is that the close-knit family shares a political philosophy and an optimistic view of what America could achieve.\n\nLogevall described JFK’s brand of Democratic politics as “pragmatic liberalism,” RFK as deeply committed to liberalism and Ted Kennedy as left of center.\n\n'Betrayal' of Robert F. Kennedy's legacy\n\nBut the common thread was that “they had faith in America, in this flawed, but real democracy,” Logevall said, adding: “That’s why up until this moment, the Kennedys were in agreement with one another politically.”\n\nWith his role as a top lieutenant to Trump and his embrace of the bombastic MAGA movement, Logevall said RFK Jr. “is out of step with what the Kennedy family has stood for politically and continues to stand for.”\n\nIn November, Maxwell Kennedy wrote a searing opinion article in the Boston Globe accusing his older brother, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., of a \"betrayal\" of their father's legacy by supporting the Trump administration's cuts to food assistance programs for “America’s neediest.”\n\nAn environmental attorney for about 30 years, RFK Jr's embrace of Trump has mystified his family. During his first term, Trump's administration rolled back more than 100 environmental rules. Tapping RFK Jr. to join his second term, Trump promised to let him “go wild” on health, food and medicine.\n\n\"Donald Trump is anathema to everything our family stands for,\" Kerry Kennedy, one of RFK Jr.'s siblings, told USA TODAY in August 2024. \"I distance myself and reject everything that Bobby is doing and saying because I think that it's a rejection of our family's values and everything that I've spent my life working for....And, frankly, everything Bobby spent his life working for.\"\n\nIf her father and uncle were still alive, they’d have detested everything about Trump, Kerry Kennedy added in the interview where she described her plans to stump for Kamala Harris, who by then had replaced Biden as the Democratic nominee.\n\nResponding before Election Day 2024 to his family's criticism, RFK Jr. told Fox News that he understood that his relatives were troubled by his decisions. \"But, you know, I think we all need to be able to disagree with each other and still love each other,” he said.\n\n'God sent me President Trump'\n\nLess than 10 days after Trump won his second term as president, he tapped Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nKennedy’s nomination faced fierce resistance from many in the scientific community over his promotion of unfounded claims about vaccines causing autism and antidepressants being linked to school shootings. On the eve of Kennedy's confirmation hearing, his cousin and the only living child of JFK posted a video on social media calling Kennedy a \"predator.\"\n\n“I have known Bobby my whole life,\" Caroline Kennedy said in the video, in which she read aloud a letter she wrote to senators who'd be voting on RFK Jr.'s nomination. \"We grew up together. It’s no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because he himself is a predator.\"\n\nRFK Jr. did not respond to Caroline Kennedy's allegation.\n\nFollowing Senate approval as one of Trump’s Cabinet picks, RFK Jr. was sworn into his new job during an Oval Office ceremony surrounded by his wife, actress Cheryl Hines, and his children.\n\n\"For 20 years, I'm up every morning on my knees and praying that God would put me in a position where I can end the childhood chronic disease epidemic in this country,\" he said. \"God sent me President Trump.\" \n\nOver the last 11 months, Kennedy has made sweeping changes to vaccines, food and prescription drug policies. He's also targeted ultra-processed foods, linking them to chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes and certain cancers. \n\nRFK Jr’s MAHA policies around food regulation and limiting animal testing have found broad bipartisan support from the American public, according to polls. That's in contrast to his policies around vaccines and severe funding cuts to HHS, which have been roundly criticized by scientists and lawmakers of both parties. In March, Kennedy announced the consolidation of divisions and elimination of 20,000 full-time employees in a major restructuring, saying it would save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year.\n\nIn June, Kennedy removed all 17 members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's expert vaccine panel and filled many of the positions with people who have been vaccine skeptics or questioned COVID-19 vaccine mandates.\n\nPublic criticism, once again, came from his family. In a New Yorker essay headlined 'A battle with my blood,' Tatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of JFK and daughter of Caroline Kennedy, revealed that she had less than a year to live. She minced no words.\n\n\"As I spent more and more of my life under the care of doctors, nurses, and researchers striving to improve the lives of others, I watched as Bobby cut nearly a half billion dollars for research into mRNA vaccines, technology that could be used against certain cancers,\" wrote Schlossberg, 35, who is undergoing treatment for a rare form of blood cancer. \"Slashed billions in funding from the National Institutes of Health, the world’s largest sponsor of medical research.\"\n\nSchlossberg wrote that despite her mother’s letter to the Senate and her brother, Jack Scholssberg, speaking out “against his lies for months, I watched from my hospital bed as Bobby, in the face of logic and common sense, was confirmed for the position, despite never having worked in medicine, public health, or the government.\"\n\nHolding on to the legacy of feeling others' pain\n\nGiven that RFK Jr. currently holds the most high-profile political position in the famed family, where does that leave the Kennedy legacy?\n\nFor her part, Townsend, a former lieutenant governor of Maryland, has made it her mission to advocate for strong regulations and accountability in the tech industry. She currently serves as an advisor for a nonprofit called Guard Rail Now to help states develop AI regulations.\n\nThe oldest of 11 children, Townsend was 16 years old when her father was assassinated. As far as the family legacy, she says each member has the \"obligation to make our country fairer, more just, and to give back.\"\n\nBeing the oldest, has she ever thought of herself as the peacekeeper in the family? Townsend said she didn’t see it that way. “I don't know if this search for peace is really an appropriate way to live,” she replied. “I think it's more important to feel other people's pain and your own pain.\"\n\nIt’s also important to feel joy when joy is appropriate, Townsend said, a lesson she learned from her mother, who with a sense of humor and a zest for life raised the large family after her husband’s assassination.\n\n“Joy is not peaceful. Joy is enthusiasm,\" Townsend said, adding with a laugh: \"My mother didn't go around looking for peace. She felt joy and excitement and thrill and a desire to win at tennis - that's not peace.\"\n\nWhile family members might have differing definitions of patriotism, one thing is clear: The Kennedys do not shy away from being public about what they believe is right. Maintaining family peace is not the priority.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House correspondent for USA TODAY.

Then there was Charles Person, the youngest among the original famed \"Freedom Riders\" protest in 1961. Joseph McNeil took a stand … by sitting, at a Whites-only Woolworth's lunch counter. Jo Ann Allen, one of the \"Clinton 12,\" was among the first to endure the desegregation of schools all across the South. Bobby Cain was, too. He became the first Black student to graduate under those conditions.A decade later, courage like that inspired the likes of Jesse Colin Young and the Youngbloods to record a song with a message of belonging, \"Get Together.\" \"Come on people now,Smile on your brother,Everybody get together,Try to love one another right now\"The song permeated the Summer of Love. The late Sly Stone, of Sly and the Family Stone, got on board the inclusion train, too, with his song \"Everyday People.\" He certainly had an ear for the times. Remembering Sly Stone (\"Sunday Morning\")From 2023: The reclusive Sly Stone returns, on the page (\"Sunday Morning\")Dick Cheney, who had an ear for politics, started his career the same year that song came out. He went on to become the most influential Vice President in history, especially in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. Asked by \"Sunday Morning\" in 2015 if he was changed by the events of that day, Cheney replied, \"Well, it's been alleged by some of my friends that 9/11 did change Cheney, that when he was a Secretary of Defense in the first Bush administration, he was a warm, pleasant, lovable fellow, and he became more of a hard rock afterwards. And I think that's probably true.\"He remained a staunch conservative – until, that is, 2024, when he voted for Democrat Kamala Harris. From 2009: The Cheney Exit Interview (\"Face the Nation\")That's similar to Supreme Court Justice David Souter. Nominated by President George H.W. Bush, he leaned more to the left in his later years. He left us at 85.Passage: Remembering Justice David Souter (\"Sunday Morning\")Right in the middle was Senator Alan Simpson, who balanced his conservative views with more moderate stands -- a plain-spoken cowboy from the plains of Wyoming who got his wings at 93.Alan Simpson and Norman Mineta: A friendship born in one of America's darkest hours (\"Sunday Morning\")Peter Yarrow, of Peter Paul and Mary, got his wings this year, too. The tenor who helped bridge the gap between folk and pop was 86.From 2004: Peter Yarrow and John Kerry's long strange tripJimmy Cliff (\"I Can See Clearly Now\") bridged another gap: helping make reggae mainstream. The former choir boy from Jamaica found some of his inspiration in the traditions of gospel music, such as \"Many Rivers to Cross.\"Pope Francis crossed that final river this year – a day after he blessed the faithful in St. Peter's Square on Easter Sunday.The \"People's Pope\": The future of Pope Francis' legacy (\"Sunday Morning\")From 2017: St. Francis + Pope Francis (\"Sunday Morning\")Whether you believe in Heaven as a destination or not, there's no doubt the heavens are unending. Astronaut James Lovell never landed on the moon, but saw it closer than most. He took to the skies for the last time at age 97.Remembering pioneering astronaut Jim Lovell (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")From 2018: How Apollo 8 sent a timeless holiday greeting from the heavens (\"Sunday Morning\")Back on Earth, astrophysicist Fred Espenak was chasing our galaxy with a telescope. He witnessed the moon blot out the sun 52 times – a sci-fi experience in real life.Preparing for the Great American Eclipse of 2017 (\"Sunday Morning\")We lost others who imagined life beyond the stars – in movie posters. Drew Struzan was the artist behind the theater posters for the \"Star Wars\" films and the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy. Renato Casaro gave life to blockbusters like \"Rambo\" and \"Terminator 2.\"From 2022: An 86-year-old movie poster artist's unlikely third act (\"CBS Mornings\")And then there was Joe Caroff, the artist who created the James Bond logo.We also lost some who appeared in those classic Bond films – tough guys like Bruce Glover, the assassin in \"Diamonds Are Forever\"; and Joe Don Baker, the arms dealer in \"The Living Daylights.\" And so many, many more: Graham Greene (\"Dances With Wolves\"); Enzo Staiola (\"Bicycle Thieves\"); Pat Crowley (\"Forever Female\"); Patrick Adiarte (\"The King and I\"); Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (\"Mortal Kombat\"); Michael Madsen (\"Reservoir Dogs\"); and Sally Kirkland (\"Anna\").We lost Rebekah Del Rio, that unforgettable singer in \"Mulholland Drive,\" the same year that we lost director David Lynch who put her in that film. In 2016 Lynch told \"Sunday Morning\" that people should not confuse the characters in his movies with his state of mind: \"Stories are stories,\" he said. \"And like I say, the artist doesn't have to suffer to show suffering.\"Remembering visionary filmmaker David LynchOscar-nominee Diane Ladd offered plenty of suffering in Lynch's \"Wild at Heart.\" Her daughter, Laura Dern, and the rest of her fans mourned her loss at 89.From 2023: Diane Ladd and Laura Dern: A mother and daughter with much to say (\"Sunday Morning\")Sharing a spot on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with Ladd, far from the beach, was the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson. Wilson was called the poet laureate of surf culture. Remembering Brian Wilson (\"Sunday Morning\")From 2015: Brian Wilson's summer of milestones (\"Sunday Morning\")From 2012: The Beach Boys: Back catching another wave (\"Sunday Morning\")But when it came to the poetry of baseball, there were few better than Bob Uecker. He was a ballplayer who became \"Mr. Baseball,\" a pioneer for his wit and self-deprecating humor. Asked by \"Sunday Morning\" in 2024 his favorite Bob Uecker line, he replied, \"Just a bit outside. That's where my wife put me a lot of times!\"Nina Kuscsik was left outside of the men in marathons – until, that is, she became the first woman to enter the New York City Marathon, and the first official female winner of the Boston Marathon.From 2022: The Six Who Sat reflect on the 1972 New York City Marathon that made history (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")In figure skating, Dick Button was the first to land a double axel, and the first American to bring home gold in Olympic figure skating – twice. Button was elegant and fierce, much the way George Foreman was in the boxing ring. He got a heavyweight world title in his 20s – and then unbelievably again in his 40s. And even if you never saw him box, you probably saw him cook. He described his George Foreman Grill as a real \"knockout.\"From 2005: Boxer and grill pitchman George Foreman (\"Sunday Morning\")Another ringmaster – and master marketer - was Hulk Hogan, the face of professional wrestling for decades. He was the ultimate showman, who died of cardiac arrest at age 71.There were, this year, so many unnatural deaths, especially, it seems, on college campuses, from Brown University just before Christmas, to Utah Valley University, where political activist Charlie Kirk was murdered. He was there organizing young voters around Christian conservative values. The students who saw what happened will never be the same. Anne Marie Hochhalter survived the mass shooting at Columbine High School in 1999, but 26 years later it caught up with her. She died from injuries related to the shooting that left her paralyzed. She was only 43.It's hard to fathom just how much life does come after a tragedy. John Cleary was shot on the campus of Kent State University, a moment captured in a Life Magazine photo. But he ended up finishing his degree in architecture. He lived another 55 years.We lost others in architecture, too. David Childs designed the Freedom Tower in the wake of 9/11.From 2011: David Childs and the view from 1 WTC (\"Sunday Morning\")We lost Frank Gehry, perhaps the most recognizable American architect since Frank Lloyd Wright. Passage: Remembering architect Frank Gehry (\"Sunday Morning\")From the archives: Architect Frank Gehry (\"Sunday Morning\")And then there was Giorgio Armani, an architect of fashion, who turned red carpet events into press conference. Who was wearing him got a lot of coverage. Passage: Remembering fashion designer Giorgio Armani (\"Sunday Morning\")From 2006: Designer Giorgio Armani (\"Sunday Morning\")So many of those who asked the questions trying to get answers about all kinds of things left us this year, like our colleague Mark Knoller. With his booming voice, and a treasure trove of presidential trivia, he gave CBS' White House coverage a real spark. Morris Banks, a cameraman who was equally intimidating in stature, travelled the world for CBS to brings us stories of people and events. The same was true of \"Sunday Morning\"'s Jim McLaughlin. And indeed, so many, many more: CBS cameraman Dave Dorsett; William Galbraith, chief editor, CBS News, Washington; CBS News producer, editor and writer Jerry Mazza; Chuck Milton, of CBS Sports; CBS News correspondent Ed Rabel; CBS News editor Seth Fox; Belva Davis, anchor, CBS News in San Francisco; Peter Arnett of CNN; and NPR's Susan Stamberg. Asked by \"Sunday Morning\" in 2021 about the future of radio, Stamberg replied, \"People will always listen and want to hear stories told by human voices.\"Human voices, sometimes shouting in the wilderness, can do remarkably good things, even if those voices are voicing pain. Virginia Giuffre was the first of Jeffrey Epstein's victims to go public. Soon, other survivors joined her. They began speaking with one voice – shining lights in the dark. In 2020 she told \"CBS This Morning,\" \"The buck stops when every single monster gets held accountable and our children are safe. And we need everyone's help.\"Giuffre was just 41.Jeffrey Epstein survivor Virginia Giuffre, in her own words (\"Sunday Morning\")Conservationist Jane Goodall raised her voice from the jungles of East Africa, where her work with chimpanzees made us look at ourselves – and our relationship with the animal kingdom – in a different and special way. In 1990 she said, \"We're not quite as different from the rest of the animal kingdom as we used to think.\"Passage: Remembering Jane Goodall (\"Sunday Morning\")From 2021: Jane Goodall on her hope for the future (\"Sunday Morning\")In fact, animals can seem every bit as human as we are. June Lockhart played Lassie's \"mom,\" among a lot of other roles. She was always just as intuitive as Lassie herself.That Golden Era of TV started the career of Rob Reiner, too, and while he was a good actor, it was directing where he really made his mark. Name some of your favorite movies and chances are Reiner directed them. From comedy (\"This Is Spinal Tap,\" \"When Harry Met Sally,\" \"The Princess Bride\"), to drama (\"Misery,\" \"A Few Good Men\"), he had his finger on our pulse the way few people did.Rob Reiner, and his wife Michele, left us far too soon. Remembering the treasured films of Rob Reiner (\"Sunday Morning\")From the archives: Three with Rob Reiner (\"Sunday Morning\")Another familiar face was George Wendt. As Norm on \"Cheers,\" there's no wonder everybody knew his name. Wendt was 76.Patrons of real-life Cheers mourn George Wendt's death, \"drink a beer for Norm\"We also lost David Ketchum from \"Get Smart\"; and Malcolm Jamal Warner, from \"The Cosby Show.\" It's hard to think of any of them getting any older. Take TV's Dennis the Menace: Child actor Jay North couldn't stay young forever. He was 73 when he died at his home in Florida.And then there was actor Richard Chamberlain, who played the young intern Dr. Kildare. He went on to star in blockbuster TV miniseries like \"Shogun\" and \"The Thorn Birds.\"Both those novels hit the bestseller list – and so did the \"Confessions of a Shopaholic\" series, authored by Madeleine Wickham, who wrote under the pen-name Sophie Kinsella.In 2014 she told \"CBS This Morning,\" \"You're hoping that people will enjoy your book, but you don't know, and off it goes. But then you meet somebody who says 'Well you know what, I ,,read your book in the middle of the night while I was recovering from operation, and it got me through.' I mean, how could you do anything better in life than that?\" The British author died of brain cancer at just 55.Few British playwrights have been compared to Shakespeare, but Tom Stoppard was. In 1999 he told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"It seemed to me that having a play on at the National Theatre, for example, was some kind of Everest which only a chosen few could ever even hope to aspire to. It turns out to be something that can happen to people like me.\"He was 88 when he slipped this mortal coil. For all the creative writers and performers that we did lose this year, we were really struck by the sheer number of TV personalities who passed away: Polly Holliday (\"Alice\"); Loni Anderson (\"WKRP in Cincinnati\"); Lulu Roman (\"Hee-Haw\"); Ruth Buzzi (\"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In\"); Prunella Scales (\"Fawlty Towers\"); Danielle Spencer (\"What's Happening!!\"); Lynne Marie Stewart ( \"Pee-Wee's Playhouse\"); and Loretta Swit (\"M*A*S*H\"). Portrayals of those in our nation's uniform rarely get better than \"M*A*S*H\" or, later, \"Top Gun.\" Few could top Tom Cruise as a cocky Naval aviator, but Val Kilmer did. He played so many other roles, from Jim Morrison of The Doors, to Doc Holliday in \"Tombstone.\" \"I like characters,\" Kilmer told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2013. \"I think that's what people have enjoyed most in my acting.\" But it was \"Iceman\" that stuck with all of us right till the very end. Val Kilmer was 65.Airmen who saw real combat in World War II are few and far between these days, like John \"Lucky\" Luckadoo. They called him that because he survived so much, and he continued to, making it to 103.World War II veteran John \"Lucky\" Luckadoo reflects on his serviceFrom 2024: World War II veterans speak to the ages (\"Sunday Morning\")Joe Harris lived to 108 – one of the oldest WWII paratroopers.From 2024: World War II veteran celebrates 108th birthday in ComptonGeorge Hardy earned his wings at just 19, making him one of the youngest Tuskegee Airmen. Jessie Mahaffey survived the attack on Pearl Harbor – and the sinking of another ship just a year later. he was 102. Donald McPherson distinguished himself as an \"ace\" in the skies above Okinawa. Julia Parsons, one of the last Enigma code breakers, left us, too, this, year.Some, however, never came home, but Vietnam POW Lt Col. Robert Stirm finally did. The Pulitzer Prize-winning picture said it all – his family seeing his face for the first time in almost six years.Words never matched those feelings, but lyricist Alan Bergman's words got pretty close. He and his wife, co-writer Marilyn Bergman, are perhaps best known for the classic \"The Way We Were.\"So many couples we remember the way they were, like Dorothy Vogel and her late husband Herb. On modest means, upstairs in their rent-controlled apartment, they amassed an art collection worth millions. True to their modesty, before their deaths, they gave most of it away. What Rick Davies gave away was his artistry behind the Wurlitzer electric piano. It gave the supergroup Supertramp its signature chart-topping sound. He was 81.We lost \"Space Ace\" – Ace Frehley – of the heavy metal group Kiss this year, too. He made fans believe his playing really did make his guitar smoke (and maybe it did!). And then there was Ozzy Osbourne, the lead singer of Black Sabbath and self-described Prince of Darkness. His wife, Sharon Osbourne, stayed with him through thick and thin. Asked by \"Sunday Morning\" in 2012 what their secret was, Ozzy replied, \"I don't know. You know, I'm in the rock and roll. Because you rock and you roll. You know, you just get on with it.\"Looking back on Ozzy Osbourne's life and legacyThose musicians who have just \"gone with it,\" like D'Angelo and Connie Francis, still left us their talents that make us, as trumpeter Chuck Mangione did, feel \"so good\" ... like Bobby Sherman (\"Julie, Do Ya Love Me\"); John Lodge of The Moody Blues (\"Nights in White Satin\"); and Marianne Faithfull (\"As Tears Go By\");From 2009: Marianne Faithfull on the hard road to becoming a legend (\"Sunday Morning\")There was also singer and guitarist Wayne Osmond of The Osmonds (\"Crazy Horses\"), and Mark Volman of The Turtles (\"Happy Together\").\"Happy together\" just might describe what most people were feeling when they were in the company of the legendary Diane Keaton. Some called her quirky, even kooky. But everyone agreed she was talented beyond measure. She could do searing dramas and romantic comedies, always holding her own with the best of them. \"I think that one of the reasons I've been able to be around for as long as I have, is because I have been in funny movies,\" she told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2010.She left her mark not only as an actor, but with her fashion sense, too.From 2010: Diane Keaton on Woody Allen, \"Annie Hall,\" and marriage (\"Sunday Morning\")Keaton was certainly unique, as most of those we remember are. There are far too many to name. But for their talents, their passions, their love and care and influence, we are forever grateful.To all of them we bid a very fond \"Hail, and Farewell.\" Story produced by Young Kim.
