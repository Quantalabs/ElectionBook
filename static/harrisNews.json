It was a few days after Caitlin Clark had been drafted first overall by the Indiana Fever.\n\nHe predicted her star would wane after entering the WNBA. Or more specifically he said: “no one will give a f—k about Clark in a year.”\n\nI told him he had rocks in his head, as another friend watching made a note in his calendar.\n\nOn April 19, that other friend sent us both a reminder to check in on our debate, a year on. I smugly proclaimed victory.\n\nEveryone still gave a f—k about Caitlin Clark: her legions of fans, the city of Indianapolis, where Clarkmania brought in an estimated $36 million, and especially her haters. Even Shane Gillis recently told Flagrant podcast that he was “starstruck” when Clark came to his show in Indiana.\n\nA year on, the basketball world is still spinning on her axis and she’s transformed the landscape of women’s athletics — the way Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods did in their respective sports.\n\nAll the proof is in Christine Brennan’s new book, “On Her Game” which chronicles the rise of Clark from an Iowa-grown phenom to WNBA megastar.\n\nThe veteran sportswriter was drawn to the project because Clark continuously grabbed national headlines, even more than her male peers. In fact, she notes that the women’s 2024 NCAA final pitting Iowa against South Carolina drew four million more viewers than the men’s Final the next night.\n\n“That’s a sentence I never thought I would write. Women’s college basketball being more popular than men’s college basketball? In 21st-century America? How was that possible?” wrote Brennen. “The answer was Clark.”\n\nShe added that there was “so much to tell.” Indeed, it is a whiplash inducing book.\n\nIt’s pretty insane to recap just how much happened to Clark in the span of a year. But also, how much Clark happened to us.\n\nHer impact was immediate. When she arrived in May, the league, which had previously flown commercial, were now given charter flights and many teams moved their Fever match ups to bigger arenas to accommodate the demand when Clark came to town.\n\nBrennan’s book underscores just how uniquely equipped this confident 22-year-old was for this moment. \n\nThe WNBA, however, was not.\n\nBrennan noted that the media covering the league was insular and protective of its status quo, which was majority black, LBGT and hyper focused on social justice.\n\n“When a league is small and often ignored, as the WNBA has been, there can be inclination among some members of the media to want to fight for it and even reluctance to let outsiders in.\n\n“Into this landed Caitlin Clark, a white, straight 22-year-old woman” who hadn’t played a single possession, but was already the face of the league, wrote Brennan.\n\n“To say people were conflicted about it would be an understatement.”\n\nVeteran Diana Taurasi famously told Scott Van Pelt in March of 2024, “reality is coming” for Clark. (By September, Van Pelt noted that Taurasi was wrong and that Clark, who would win rookie of the year and led her team to the playoffs, “was the reality”).\n\nClark faced many inhospitable veterans. In June, Chicago Sky’s Chennedy Carter hip checked Clark in an outrageous foul that was far from a basketball play.\n\nOn Threads, Carter wrote of Clark, “beside three-point shooting what does she bring to the table man?”\n\nClark took the high road, saying Carter didn’t owe her a public apology. “No, basketball is competitive. I get it.”\n\nThen came her Olympic snub last summer, which Brennan saw as malpractice.\n\n“How did all those skilled basketball minds on the committee miss how good Clark already was — and how well she would be playing by the Olympic break? The answer was becoming clearer by the day: because they wanted to.”\n\nBut she was also expected to answer for society’s ills and maybe some nasty things fans of her said on social media — despite loads of ugly race-based insults thrown her way.\n\nIn mid-June, Clark was asked by a reporter about people using her name to push agendas.\n\n“People can talk about what they want to talk about… I’m just here to play basketball,” she said, adding she could not control others.\n\nConnecticut Sun’s Dijonai Carrington tweeted, “Dawg. How one can not be bothered by their name being used to justify racism, bigotry, misogyny, xenophobia, homophobia & the intersectionality of them all is nuts.”\n\nClark handled a follow up deftly, but a pile on ensued. It showed that the league could be unserious, making hoops an afterthought.\n\nThen in September, Clark caused another uproar by simply liking Taylor Swift’s Instagram endorsement of Kamala Harris.\n\nIn December, she was named Time Athlete of the Year. The next month, a man was arrested for stalking her.\n\nThe book isn’t full of bombshells, but Brennan is unsparing in her criticism of the league being caught flat-footed by Clark.\n\nShe called out WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert who during a “60 Minutes” piece on Clark and the league, refused to give the star sole credit for its insane growth.\n\nReporter Jon Wertheim pointed out that when she is asked about Clark, she “brings up other rookies as well.”\n\n“No league is ever about one player,” she responded.\n\nBrennan wrote, “By practically any measure, Clark was that one person.”","summary":" Clark has transformed the landscape of women’s athletics — the way Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods did in their respective sports.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/09/opinion/new-book-how-seismic-caitlin-clarks-impact-on-sports-is/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/newspress-collage-p9p3twrm9-1752104453810.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1752090074&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/x98fgzzJ-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-09 23:41:17","author":"Kirsten Fleming","authors":["Kirsten Fleming"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.197},{"id":340032364,"title":"Revealed: The Surprising Truth Behind the Amusing Exchange Between Trump and Obama at Jimmy Carter’s Funeral","text":"THE truth behind President Donald Trump and rival Barack Obama’s cheery conversation at Jimmy Carter’s funeral has been unveiled in a new book.\n\nLeading journalists have unveiled what had Obama chuckling in the church pews, following interviews with over 350 individuals connected to the intense 2024 presidential election.\n\nOn January 9, after Trump decisively overcame opponent Kamala Harris, all leaders except Michelle Obama set aside political differences to participate in Carter’s funeral.\n\nAmericans were captivated by images from the event showing Obama sharing a broad smile while talking with Trump, who was on the verge of being inaugurated.\n\nThe pair was seated beside each other for the proceedings while stone-faced Harris sat coldly behind them.\n\nIt was far different from 2018, when Melania Trump sat in between the two rivals for George H. W. Bush’s funeral after the reality TV star had defeated Hillary Clinton.\n\nNow, in the book 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, sources have revealed that Trump broke a smile out of his rival by inviting him to play golf at one of his elite clubs.\n\nTrump had Obama in stiches as he was “enticing him with descriptions of Trump’s courses around the world,” the passage reads, according to Axios.\n\nAnd this wasn’t the only time that the president spoke about his favorite sport with his political rivals, according to authors Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager, and Isaac Arnsdorf.\n\nThe three journalists, who covered the campaign together for the Washington Post, spoke with hundreds of sources who gave a behind-the-scenes look at how Harris and Biden conceded to Trump.\n\nThey wrote that Trump also had a friendly chat with Biden when the incumbant congratulated his arch nemesis on his win and invited him to visit the White House.\n\n“In another life, we would be friends and go golfing,” Trump said, according to the reporters.\n\nHARRIS’ STEP DOWN\n\nMeanwhile, Harris and Trump had a much icier conversation filled with technical difficulties when she admitted defeat.\n\nThe vice president’s aides had a lot of difficulty merging their calls, and resulted to holding two phones on speaker close together so everyone could speak.\n\nIn the midst of the fumbling, Trump joked “Phone service isn’t what it used to be,” according to the book.\n\nThe Republican leader called Harris a “tough cookie” and complimented her husband Douglas Emhoff.\n\nHe failed to compliement her campaign and only said, “she’d given him a run for his money.”\n\nThe book says, “Even her aides described him as gracious.”\n\nMeanwhile, Harris was described as “professional but not warm” and told her rival that the “country was too divided” and that “she hoped he would be a president for all Americans.”\n\nBIDEN OPENS UP ON TRUMP WIN\n\nTwo months after Biden stepped down from the White House, Pager gave him a call and the two had a brief chat.\n\nThe reporter was asking him to sit down for an interview for the book when the former president said he had a “very negative” view of Trump’s second term.\n\n“I don’t see anything he’s done as productive,” Biden said, according to the authors.\n\nWhen quizzed on whether he regretted not stepping down earlier, Biden said, “No, not now.

Tim Walz as her running mate, a decision widely panned by pundits in retrospect.\n\n“2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America,” released Tuesday by journalists Josh Dawsey of The Wall Street Journal, Tyler Pager of The New York Times and Isaac Arnsdor of The Washington Post, described a vetting process that came down to three finalists: Walz, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.\n\nAll three candidates did a final interview with Harris at her residence, the book explains, adding that when asked what they wanted to drink, Shapiro and Kelly chose water while Walz chose Diet Mountain Dew.\n\nAppeal with rural voters was a top priority for the Harris ticket and the book states that Harris’s advisors felt that Walz was the best candidate to do that.\n\n“Pelosi privately pushed for him too, because she’d worked with him in Congress,” the book said about the former House speaker. “The pitch for Walz was straightforward: He could appeal to white voters across the Blue Wall states (Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania) and hopefully help Harris with male voters. He’d never lost election.”\n\nWhile most political experts felt Shapiro, governor of a key swing state, was the most logical choice, the book states that the interview with Harris and Shapiro “revealed the two were not a perfect match.”\n\n“He came across as overly ambitious, pushing Harris to define what his role would be. He also conceded it would not be natural for him to serve as someone’s number two, leaving Harris with a bad impression,” the book states.\n\nConversely, the authors explain that Walz was “deferential” while “showing no interest in himself” and “flatly denied any interest in running for president.”\n\n“He went so far as to proactively volunteer reasons why she might not want to pick him,” the book says. “In his interview that Friday, he said he had never used a teleprompter before. On Sunday, he told Harris, ‘I would understand if you went with someone else because I’m really nervous about the debate, and I don’t think I’ll do well.’ Still, the vetting team did not fully appreciate his tendency to misspeak, his folksiness sometimes tipping into factual imprecision.”\n\nWalz would ultimately draw intense scrutiny on the campaign trail for his “folksiness” with a series of blunders, including his characterization of his military service and a claim he was present at the Tiananmen Square massacre.\n\nThe book says Harris “struggled” deciding between Shapiro and Walz, believing that she had a better “rapport” with Walz but understood the importance of Pennsylvania. Harris’ team, according to the book, told her that polling did not offer a clear answer as to which of the two candidates would help the ticket more.\n\n“There was no empirical evidence that Shapiro would deliver Pennsylvania and with it the White House,” the book said.\n\nAs Shapiro was being considered, many pundits speculated that his staunch support of Israel could be an issue given the progressive wing of the Democratic Party being vocally pro-Palestinian, resulting in protests, sometimes violent, across the country after Oct. 7.\n\nThe book said the Harris campaign was aware of that issue.\n\n“Much of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party declared war on Shapiro, largely because of his support of Israel,” the book said. “Some Shapiro allies saw the criticism as deeply unfair and borderline antisemitic, since the governor was an observant Jew, but his positions on the Palestinian conflict broadly aligned with the Biden administration and the other vice presidential contenders. The lawyers vetting Shapiro did flag some comments they viewed as more incendiary, particularly as it related to pro- Palestinian protests on college campuses after the October 7 attacks.”\n\n“One that caught their attention was his commentary on CNN from April: ‘We have to query whether or not we would tolerate this, if this were people dressed up in KKK outfits or KKK regalia, making comments about people who are African American in our communities.’”\n\nUltimately, the book says Harris “went with her gut” and chose Walz believing he was the “better fit” in a decision her staff was “unanimously behind.”\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Walz’s office and Shapiro’s office declined to comment.\n\nAfter losing every battleground state and ultimately the presidency to Donald Trump, critics were quick to judge the Walz pick as a misstep by Harris.\n\n“The choice of Walz was only one of many disastrous mistakes but symptomatic of one larger problem – the Democratic Party leadership is too scared to say no to the hard-left progressive wing of the party,” Julian Epstein, longtime Democratic operative and former chief counsel to the House Judiciary Committee, told Fox News Digital shortly after the election.\n\nRob Bluey, president and executive editor of The Daily Signal, told Fox News Digital in November that Harris picking Walz “proved to be a disastrous decision that doomed Kamala Harris from the moment she made it.”\n\n“Not only was Walz ill-prepared for the national spotlight and media scrutiny, but Harris passed over several better options,” Bluey said. “Given how little Americans knew about Harris or her policy positions, they were right to question her judgment on this big decision.”","summary":"The new book says that former Speaker Pelosi 'privately pushed' for Walz.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/09/media/harris-went-with-her-gut-on-decision-to-pick-walz-as-her-running-mate-over-shapiro-book/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/newspress-collage-njlb91chi-1752099789496.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1752085452&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-09 22:25:50","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.089},{"id":340032668,"title":"Will Zohran Mamdani Become the Democrat Party’s Trump?","text":"Americans’ trust in the corporate media has cratered. And with good reason: After decades of deception and distortion—considering its uncritical coverage of the wars in the Middle East, its peddling of the Trump-Russia collusion narrative, its inconsistent reporting on COVID-19, its selective ignorance during the 2020 election, and its efforts to conceal President Biden’s cognitive decline—the corporate press has earned every ounce of the public’s suspicion.\n\nNow, Americans are tuning out the noise and tuning in to new voices to stay informed. UnHerd Washington Correspondent Emily Jashinsky has emerged as one of those voices. She joined “The Signal Sitdown” this week to discuss her new show with Megyn Kelly’s MK Media, “After Party with Emily Jashinsky,” the fallout from President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” and whether or not Zohran Mamdani represents the future of the national Democrat Party.\n\n“I’m very weirdly optimistic,” Jashinsky said of the alternative media’s rise. “I feel so strange about this because one of the reasons I got into media is because I’ve always been obsessed with media and I’ve always been so pessimistic. But the last, I don’t know, year or two, I’ve started to feel optimistic about media, not because there aren’t still very powerful bad actors, not because some of the new actors aren’t also bad, but because the demand for transparency from the audience, I think, is pushing us in at least a better direction.”\n\nJashinsky told The Daily Signal that the age of new media will be dominated by journalists who are able to “establish trust with [their] audience and to best establish transparency.” Jashinsky cited how “60 Minutes” selectively edited the interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat presidential nominee. “People were demanding the transcript, and I think that’s the way people like us, our age and younger, want to consume news.”\n\n“They really don’t want it to look or feel edited,” Jashinsky added. “There’s probably always going to be some editing, but they want stuff that’s live. We want stuff that’s transparent.”\n\nThe same can be said of alternative media’s class of commentators like Megyn Kelly and Tucker Carlson. “I think we’re in the golden age of reported commentary,” Jashinsky said. On digital shows and podcasts, “you’re able to do reported commentary on the fly in a way that, I think, is even more authentic and in a way that really resonates.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s ability to tap into the independent media ecosystem and the public’s craving for authenticity helped build a political coalition that propelled him back to the White House. \n\nThe breadth of that coalition, however, is both a blessing and a curse as the variety of interests within Trump’s camp compete for the president’s ear as he tries to act on his campaign promises. On July 4, Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill, the massive budget reconciliation package that delivered on many of those promises, into law. \n\n”When you have very narrow margins in the House and a very narrow margin in the Senate, you end up absolutely having to keep a coalition together that includes Chip Roy and either Lisa Murkowski or Susan Collins,” Jashinsky said. That is no easy task. “What they need to do is get Chip Roy to a place where he is sufficiently satisfied, and they need to get Lisa Murkowski to a place where she’s sufficiently satisfied,” she explained. “In order to do that, both of those things are necessarily going to mean swallowing a very bitter pill, and it was always going to be the case.\n\n“I think that’s why Trump started, from the very beginning of the process, by branding this as the one big beautiful bill because he knew that tax cuts expire at the end of the year,” the journalist added. “Republicans were facing the choice of either do a ugly reconciliation bill or let taxes go up. Obviously, they’re going to decide with an ugly reconciliation bill.”\n\n“That’s something I think Elon Musk missed,” Jashinsky said of the feud between Trump and Musk that started during the budget reconciliation negotiations. “I think Elon Musk has been shockingly naive throughout this process, and I do really think that it’s naive thinking that you can just kind of come into Washington and convince the Republican Party that has these narrow margins that they have to do some type of generational action to take on government spending when the only way to pass legislation and get it to the president’s desk is, again, to please either a Murkowski or Collins and the moderates while also pleasing the Chip Roys and the Freedom Caucus guys.”\n\n“It was never gonna happen,” Jashinksy said.\n\nNevertheless, Trump was able to accomplish much more of his agenda in this budget reconciliation package than budget reconciliation packages from his first term. The One Big Beautiful Bill not only extended and made permanent tax cuts in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act but also procured billions to secure the border, deport millions of illegal migrants, and revitalize the military.\n\nSome Democrats, however, are plotting the party’s comeback—New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani among them. Mamdani is officially infamous, constantly drawing ire from the long-time New Yorker who now lives in D.C. at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and courting support from some of the nation’s top Democrats. Will Democrats remake the party in Mamdani’s image?\n\nPotentially, Jashinsky said, but Mamdani’s coalition in New York might be much more fragile than it seems, and his victory in the Democrat primary for mayor might have more to do with New Yorker’s hatred for his opponent, disgraced former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. To maintain his coalition, Mamdani needs to thread the needle. \n\n“You have to bring the progressives in with the cultural libertarians, and then you need to bring them in with the … upwardly mobile, affluent, educated, higher income people,” Jashinsky explained. The catch? To earn the support of New York’s cocktail party class, “you do have to do some of the cultural signaling, which is very interesting. And that’s what puts off the [cultural libertarians].”\n\n“I think the likeliest case scenario is that Mamdani has a somewhat embarrassing defeat at the hands of Eric Adams, another terrible candidate, and that sort of chills the fever for him nationwide, but who knows,” Jashinsky told The Daily Signal. Certainly, stranger things have happened.","summary":"Americans’ trust in the corporate media has cratered.

And when she first tweeted it out, Tafoya used it as an opportunity to promote her podcast, which supposed flight attendant had praised as “wonderful.”\n\n“While on a flight to NYC to appear on @Gutfeldfox I was handed this note by a flight attendant. I won’t reveal the person’s name, but this made my day, to say the very least!!!!!

At least you used a slightly different photo,” attorney Damin Toell quipped, acknowledging that Tafoya had posted an image of the letter from another angle.\n\n“Michelle, you lying **** of a stunt queen.

One social media user also flagged one of Tafoya’s tweets from last year in which she blasted Kamala Harris’ campaign for posting a clip of a four-year-old JD Vance interview.\n\n“They are lying and they don't care that they are lying,” she noted at the time.\n\nAs of publication, Tafoya has yet to publicly address or acknowledge the repeated posting of the note.

According to CNN, Katz’s long-term goal is to eventually relocate the entire Palestinian population of Gaza (about 2 million people) to the southern territory, where no one would be allowed to leave.\n\nLana Del Rey Says She Prays for Palestine ‘Every Day’ While Showing Support for Texas…\n\nEilish summarized her thoughts on the proposal with one word: “horrifying.”\n\nThe development comes as Israel’s war against Hamas approaches the two-year mark. The conflict first began on Oct. 7, 2023, when the terrorist group killed 1,200 Israelis and took 251 more as hostages; more than 55,000 Palestinians have since died in Israel’s retaliation efforts, according to Reuters.\n\nEilish previously expressed her desire for the violence to end by wearing an “Artists for Ceasefire” pin at the 2024 Oscars, and on Wednesday, she also reshared a video of an activist delivering clean water to refugees along the coast of Gaza. “thank you to all the heroes out there,” she wrote on her Story.\n\nIn addition to speaking out about what’s happening in the Middle East, the Grammy winner also reshared a video of Homeland Security agents in military gear storming MacArthur Park, where many children belonging to one of L.A.’s biggest immigrant populations often play, according to The New York Times. The operation follows the widely criticized U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids on the city in June.\n\nEilish also shared a more heartwarming post on her Story celebrating the bravery of Mexican firefighters who traveled to Texas amid the recent deadly floods, assisting with recovery efforts under orders from President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo. The singer previously wrote a message of support to those affected by the natural disaster — in which more than 100 people have died — writing, “this is so sad … sending love to Texas.”\n\nEilish has long been outspoken when it comes to her political beliefs and the causes she supports, from endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election to partnering with her mom, Maggie Baird, on environmental initiatives through Support + Feed.\n\nThe star’s latest album, Hit Me Hard and Soft, dropped in May last year, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard 200.\n\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\n\nWant to know what everyone in the music business is talking about?\n\nGet in the know on\n\nVisit Billboard Pro for music business news\n\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

'And then they made it worse by talking about anchovies. Boring!'\n\nHarris has revealed details about all three issues before, so his interview would not have been groundbreaking, had it been published. \n\nBy contrast, Walz was still relatively unknown in August when Rahma deviated from his norm of interviewing his subjects on the NYC subway to travel and meet him on the trail.\n\nWalz's 'take' could not have come across as more Midwestern: home gutters.\n\n'My take is the most neglected part of home ownership is the gutters,' Walz told Rahma. 'It's personal for me.'\n\nHarris' belief that 'Bacon is a spice,' meanwhile, is a take she flaunted in Iowa on the campaign trail in 2019.\n\nHer view about people removing shoes on airplanes is a take she revealed in April with the Had It or Hit It podcast and details about her love of anchovy pizza was celebrated in July as part of what fueled her process to seize the nomination after former President Joe Biden announced his decision to step down.\n\nThe story illustrates a new window into Harris' closely guarded media access especially ongoing attempts to control content from social media influencers with preconditions to access. \n\nAfter catching a glimpse of the bizarre political world, he expressed his gratitude that he was not in the business of political media.\n\n'I never wanted to be a politics person,' he concluded.

Mamdani wrote 32 articles for the Bowdoin Orient during his four years studying at Maine’s presitigous Bowdoin College from 2010 to 2014, including an article his senior year promoting an academic boycott of Israel. \"This academic and cultural boycott aims to bring under scrutiny the actions of the Israeli government and to put pressure on Israeli institutions to end the oppressive occupation and racist policies within both Israel and occupied Palestine,\" wrote Mamdani, who co-founded his college’s Students for Justice in Palestine organization. Students for Justice in Palestine has become one of the biggest drivers of anti-Israel protests on college campuses since the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre, with some going so far as to celebrate the attack. THE PLOT TO STOP MAMDANI: DEMOCRATS SCRAMBLE TO BLOCK FAR-LEFT TAKEOVER IN NEW YORK Mamdani was taking issue in his article with Bowdoin College’s president, Barry Mills, opposing the boycott. \"Lastly, Mills regrettably makes no mention of Palestinians or Palestine,\" Mamdani wrote. \"The call for the boycott comes in response to more than 60 years of Israeli colonial occupation of Palestine. When Mills speaks of the ‘free exchange of knowledge, ideas, and research, and open discourse’ in academia, he does so while privileging partnerships with Israeli institutions over basic freedoms for Palestinians, including the rights to food, water, shelter and education, which many Palestinians are denied under Israeli rule.\" In a 2013 op-ed, Mamdani responded to a White student who took issue with criticism of the school’s editorial page being too White by accusing him of holding \"white privilege.\" \"White males are privileged in their near-to-exclusive featuring as figures of authority in print, on television and around us in our daily realities,\" Mamdani wrote. \"We, the consumers of these media, internalize this and so believe in the innate authority of a white male’s argument and the need for its publication. So, white privilege is both a structural and an individual phenomenon, the former propelling the latter. Therefore, even when the individual is silent, the structures continue to exist and frame our society through their existence.\" MAMDANI CAMP SILENT WHEN CONFRONTED WITH CALLS TO 'RADICALIZE' HIGH SCHOOLERS, 'DISMANTLE' US Mamdani said the \"pervasive male whiteness\" of the school’s opinion pages \"builds on the sadly still-present white male monopolization of both discourse and understanding.\" Mamdani explained, \"While whiteness is not homogenous, white privilege is. This privilege is clear in not having to face institutional racism in access to housing subsidies, college grants, financial institutions, or civil rights. It allows a white person to universalize his own experiences. It restricts society’s ability to understand its flaws, and projects a false image of meritocracy upon a nation built on institutional racism.\" In another post, titled \"Bearded in Cairo,\" Mamdani discussed his time studying abroad in Egypt as the Muslim Brotherhood was violently toppling President Morsi’s regime. He explained that before arriving he had grown a beard \"mostly as a symbolic middle finger\" to the stereotype that \"pervades America\" that brown individuals with beards are a \"terrorist.\" Mamdani discussed privilege again, saying that he had \"arrived in a society where privilege was a different color.\" \"Gone was the image of the white Christian male that I had grown accustomed to, and in its place was a darker, more familiar picture – ---one that, for the first time, I fit: brown skin, black hair, and a Muslim name,\" Mamdani wrote. \"With the right clothing, some took me for an Egyptian and most thought I was Syrian – either identity allowed me unrestricted access to exploring Cairo.\" In a 2014 article titled \"On the 50th anniversary of MLK’s visit to campus, let's acknowledge what we still need to achieve,\" Mamdani lamented that his school, which doubled its diversity student population over the previous 13 years, was still behind where it should be. He wrote that the school had prematurely achieved a \"satisfaction with the level of diversity.\" \"I have been forced to personally grapple with these inconsistencies during my time here,\" Mamdani wrote. RESURFACED MAMDANI PHOTO SPARKS SOCIAL MEDIA FIRESTORM, OUTRAGE FROM KEY VOTING BLOC: 'SHAMEFUL' \"I sit in class not knowing whether to correct everyone’s mispronunciation of an Indian woman’s name. I usually do, but today I’m tired. I’m tired of being one of a few non-white students in a classroom, if not the only one. I bring up race in discussions only to see the thought flicker in my peers eyes and on their tongues. They sigh without a sound. I’ve brought up race again. I’ve sidetracked the discussion. I’ve chosen to make an issue out of it.\" In the same post, Mamdani, who was born in Uganda to Indian parents, outlined his struggles feeling uncomfortable being a non-white student. \"I grow a beard only to be called a terrorist,\" Mamdani wrote. \"I pronounce the ‘h’ in my name only to hear muffled laughs. Clothing becomes exotic once it clads my body. Cotton shirts are called dashikis and sandals ethnic.\" Mamdani continued, \"While I am now comfortable in my own skin, I can remember wishing for whiteness my first year when I thought certain types of girls were impossible to talk to due to my skin being more kiwi than peach. Months later, I remember thinking that attraction might only be possible when a girl had ‘a thing for brown guys.’\" Mamdani explained that he has found \"solidarity\" with some students on campus but that \"still, too few people acknowledge that race is an issue on our campus, or that it has ever been one.\" \"But if people say they are color blind, do they even see me?\" Mamdani wrote. Fox News Digital reached out to Mamdani's campaign for comment. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Mamdani burst onto the national political scene last month when he won a surprising victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary despite facing criticism for his far-left policies, which included city-run grocery stores, defunding police, safe injection sites and raising the minimum wage to $30. Mamdani's victory has sparked a civil war of sorts within the Democratic Party between those pushing to moderate since VP Kamala Harris's defeat in November and those embracing a progressive shift toward the mold of Rep. Alexandria-Cortez, D-N.Y., who endorsed Mamdani. Mamdani, thanks to his primary victory, is the clear frontrunner in the general election in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a roughly six-to-one margin.

Jasmine Crockett is the preferred candidate among Texas Democratic voters to run for Senate in 2026, according to recent polling.\n\nCrockett leads a hypothetical primary field with 35% of likely Democratic voters, followed by former Democratic Texas Rep. Colin Allred at 20%, former Presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke and Rep. Joaquin Castro tied at 13%. Just 18% of voters said they were undecided about their preferred nominee to challenge Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who is seeking his fifth Senate term. (RELATED: Wealthy White Liberals Reportedly Urge Democrats To ‘Be Willing To Get Shot’ Opposing Trump)\n\nThe poll was conducted by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Senate Republicans’ campaign arm. The NRSC is supporting Cornyn’s campaign against Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\n\nThe multimodal survey of 566 likely Democratic primary voters was conducted between July 4 and 7. Though Crockett is leading the field well outside the poll’s margin of error of plus or minus 3.03%, the liberal firebrand has not signaled that she is considering a run for the upper chamber.\n\nCrockett has emerged as one of the leading voices in the party as Democrats fight over the best approach back to power. She frequently draws controversy through her inflammatory remarks and has referred to Trump supporters as mentally ill.\n\nAllred, who previously blew through tens of millions of dollars in a failed run against Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz last November, is the only well-known candidate in the race thus far. He trails Crockett by fifteen percentage points in a hypothetical matchup.\n\nSpokespersons for Crockett and Allred did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.\n\nCastro and perennial candidate O’Rourke, who came up short in previous runs for Senate in 2018 and the governorship 2022, are both reportedly mulling runs. The deadline to enter the primary contest is the first week of December.\n\nThe polling is part of a broader survey the Republican group conducted in five battleground states — Texas, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina and Maine — that are likely to determine whether Senate Republicans can defend and expand their 53-seat majority during the midterms.\n\nThe group did not survey a hypothetical Democratic primary contest in Georgia, which Republicans view as a top pick-up opportunity due to the state’s red leanings and voters rejecting former Vice President Kamala Harris last November by more than 100,000 votes. The incumbent, Democratic Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff, has no well-known Democratic challengers and is likely to cruise to the general election contest.\n\nThough most of the primary field in the five states is not settled, the most far-left or vocally anti-Trump candidate is leading or within striking distance of supplanting the frontrunner in the majority of the states surveyed, according to the NRSC polling memo.\n\nEarly support for left-wing candidates in key states comes as the left appears to be emboldened with socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani’s shock win in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary in June. The Democratic party’s base is also urging lawmakers to aggressively resist the Trump administration with some reportedly calling on Democrats to be “willing to get shot” to thwart the president’s agenda and defy the rule of law.\n\nNearly a quarter of likely Democratic primary voters in the five states believe the Constitution should be “replaced or fundamentally changed,” according to the survey.\n\nFar-left Michigan Senate candidate Abdul El-Sayed, who has voiced support for Mamdani, is trailing Democratic Michigan Rep. Haley Stevens within the poll’s margin of error. The crowded primary field is laying the groundwork to be a bitter intraparty fight for the nomination and could bruise the candidate that advances to the general election.\n\nDemocratic Michigan state legislator Mallory McMorrow notches just 11% of Democratic primary voters, but the liberal candidate has never run statewide before nor spent significant resources on paid media.\n\nThe most left-wing candidate in Minnesota’s contested Democratic Senate primary also maintains a comfortable lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, who has embraced far-left positions on transgender issues and abortion, leads Democratic Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig 30% to 24%. Nearly half of likely Democratic primary voters are undecided.\n\nA significant number of Democratic primary voters are also undecided about their preferred candidates in Senate races in Maine and North Carolina. The seats in both states are currently held by Republicans and are viewed by Democrats as potential flip opportunities.\n\nThough Democratic Maine Governor Janet Mills tops former congressional staffer Jordan Wood by 14 percentage points, 51% of likely Democratic primary voters are undecided. Mills has not closed the door on a run and is likely to come under scrutiny for her views on transgender athletes in women’s sports and alleged former cocaine use if she jumps into the race.\n\nRepublican Maine Sen. Susan Collins decisively won reelection in 2020 despite Trump losing the state by nine percentage points.\n\nIn North Carolina, former Democratic Governor Roy Cooper is the preferred candidate for 39% of likely Democratic voters — the most support for any individual candidate measured across the five states. However, a greater number of Democratic voters in the state are undecided.\n\nCooper is reportedly leaning toward jumping into the Democratic primary. He is likely to face criticism for vetoing a state ban on child sex-change procedures in 2023 if he makes a bid for the open seat vacated by Republican North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis.\n\nThe NRSC poll also found that the top concern of Democratic voters in the five states were government entitlement programs, with 44% of those saying it was their most-important issue. The economy was second, with 23% of voters pointing to it as their main concern.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

On July 8, 2025, the rapper wrote:\"We've calculated about 100-200MM so far. #JayZ call me to settle this karmic debt. It's only collecting more interest. You still in my TOP 5 tho.

Tidal was originally launched in partnership with J. Cole, Rihanna, and Minaj and was sold to Jack Dorsey's Square company for approximately $300 million in 2021.This resulted in Minaj claiming that while she was supposed to get a big payout, she was only offered $1 million. In another tweet on the same day, the rapper mentioned that she was going to use the money that Jay-Z owed her to send some of her fans to college.What did Nicki Minaj say about Roc Nation CEO Desiree Perez? Details explored amid DJ Akademiks' praise for the female rapper speaking outIn the lengthy tweet referred to by DJ Akademiks in his post praising Nicki Minaj for speaking up, the Super Bass rapper called Roc Nation CEO Desiree Perez \"Desirat\" and addressed the presidential pardon granted to her by President Trump in his previous term.For the unversed, President Trump granted the presidential pardon to Perez for her 1994 arrest for conspiracy with intent to distribute narcotics in January 2021 before leaving office. At the time of her arrest, the Roc Nation CEO cooperated with the US Attorney's office and got a probation sentence of five years, serving nine months in jail in 1999.

Hernandez went on to win gold in the high jump and triple jump.\n\n“At the May 2025 CIF State Track and Field championships, a male competed against girls in the girls’ high jump, triple jump, and long jump,” the DOJ lawsuit said. “A few days before the championship meet, on May 27 and 28, 2025, CIF implemented a pilot entry process, by which ‘a biological female student-athlete who would have earned the next qualifying mark will also be advanced to the finals.'”\n\n“The CIF also announced that ‘if necessary, in the high jump, triple jump and long jump events at the 2025 CIF State Track and Field Championships, a biological female student-athlete who would have earned a specific placement on the podium will also be awarded the medal for that place and the results will be reflected in the recording of the event,” the complaint added.\n\nThat CIF’s statement referenced “a biological female student-athlete” and adjusted policy to provide for an additional qualifying spot and, if need be, a medal opportunity was a recognition of the “inherent athletic advantage males have over ‘biological female[s]’ and that allowing males to compete in female athletic competitions displaces girls and denies girls equal athletic opportunities,” the DOJ said.\n\nThe DOJ, in an apparent effort to follow through on President Donald Trump’s threat to pull California’s funding, said the Golden State’s “illegal” and “discriminatory” policies mean that “girls are displaced from podiums, denied awards, and miss out on critical visibility for college scholarships and recognition” by denying them the “opportunity to compete in student sports on a level playing field in which they have the same opportunities as boys.”\n\nThe complaint further raised concerns about the “privacy, dignity, and safety” of “female-only spaces” when policies “require” inclusion of a transgender classmate.\n\n“Not only do Defendants’ policies and actions eviscerate equal athletic opportunities for girls but they also require girls to share intimate spaces, such as locker rooms, with boys, causing a hostile educational environment that denies girls educational opportunities,” the complaint continued.\n\nThe DOJ is now demanding the banning of transgender female athletes from being able to participate in California high school competitions that align with their gender identity. The government additionally contemplates forcing the state to “compensate female athletes who have been denied equal athletic opportunities due to Defendants’ violations, including correcting past athletics records.”\n\nLove true crime? Sign up for our newsletter, The Law&Crime Docket, to get the latest real-life crime stories delivered right to your inbox\n\nThe DOJ lawsuit was brought by U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli for the Central District of California and Harmeet Dhillon, U.S. assistant attorney general in the civil rights division.\n\nDhillon said in a statement that the lawsuit was about combatting “woke gender ideology.”\n\n“Title IX was enacted over half a century ago to protect women and girls from discrimination. The Justice Department will not stand for policies that deprive girls of their hard-earned athletic trophies and ignore their safety on the field and in private spaces,” Dhillon said in a statement on the case. “Young women should not have to sacrifice their rights to compete for scholarships, opportunities, and awards on the altar of woke gender ideology.”\n\nDhillon is a former 2020 Trump campaign legal advisor who once hoped in vain on cable news that the conservative U.S. Supreme Court, with then-newly minted Justice Amy Coney Barrett, would “step in and do something” to save that election for Donald Trump. SCOTUS did nothing of the sort, and Joe Biden was sworn in as president the following month.\n\nIn addition, Dhillon Law Group — the firm Dhillon founded and with which, among other cases in private practice, she filed lawsuits in California over transgender matters — is currently defending President Trump against the Central Park Five’s defamation lawsuit. That case arose after Trump falsely said during a 2024 presidential debate with then-Vice President Kamala Harris that the Central Park Five “pled guilty they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately.”\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a statement of her own, also used Newsom’s words to support the lawsuit against his state.\n\n“The Governor of California has previously admitted that it is ‘deeply unfair’ to force women and girls to compete with men and boys in competitive sports,” Bondi said. “But not only is it ‘deeply unfair,’ it is also illegal under federal law. This Department of Justice will continue its fight to protect equal opportunities for women and girls in sports.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFILE – President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump are seen&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: DOJ Takes Legal Action Against California Over Trans Athlete Participation in Girls&#8217; Sports first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/doj-takes-legal-action-against-california-over-trans-athlete-participation-in-girls-sports/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DOJ-sues-California-to-ban-trans-athletes-from-girls-sports.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-09 18:38:24","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.015},{"id":339983348,"title":"Minnesota says government agencies must ‘justify’ hiring white men","text":"Employees who do not adhere to this policy will face “disciplinary action, up to and including termination.” The policy’s deeper details include mandatory interviews of at least three “underrepresented candidates” for job openings, singling out underrepresented candidates at the beginning of the hiring process, and requiring departments to provide “objective reasons for selecting a non-underrepresented candidate over the most qualified underrepresented candidate” if a non-underrepresented candidate is hired.\n\nThe “protected groups” that make up the “underrepresented” definition are “females, persons with disabilities, and members of the following minorities: Black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Alaskan native.” That means, of course, that if a department hires a white man, it must issue a “justification” for daring to choose him over any designated diversity, equity, and inclusion candidates, or else the person who hired the white man will be fired.\n\nElsewhere on the Minnesota Department of Human Rights website, we are assured, “Several federal laws provide similar anti-discrimination protections in employment as the Minnesota Human Rights Act.

Since October, when Bezos blocked publication of a planned Post endorsement of Kamala Harris for president, the departure of Post talent has been shocking and included five former editors directly above me in the newsroom’s hierarchy.\n\n“Nonetheless, Post coverage of Trump remains strong. Yet the policy against opinion in News section columns means less critical scrutiny of Trump — a result coinciding with Bezos’s unseemly and well-document[ed] coziness with the president.”\n\nDavidson wrote it was a “shock” when the column was blocked for being “too opinionated,” insisting he had written more opinionated pieces throughout his tenure at the Post, but noted that in the piece that was killed, he argued that “one hallmark of President Donald Trump’s first three, turbulent months in office is his widespread, ominous attack on thought, belief and speech.”\n\nThe piece, Davidson said, listed examples of actions taken by the Trump administration, like its efforts to deport anti-Israel activists Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk, as well as its crackdown on DEI. \n\n“Killing that column was a death blow to my life as a Washington Post columnist. But I wrote two more articles to see if I could cope with the restrictions. That’s when I learned just how severe the policy is,” Davidson wrote. “In my next piece, I was not allowed to describe a potential pay raise for federal employees as ‘well-deserved’ because of Post policy.”\n\n“As a columnist, I can’t live with that level of constraint. A column without commentary made me a columnist without a column. I also was troubled by significant inconsistencies in the implementation of the policy. During this period, The Post allowed stronger, opinionated language by other staffers, including the words ‘viciousness,’ ‘cruelty’ and ‘meanness’ to describe Trump’s actions,” he continued. \n\nDavidson, who previously wrote a farewell piece to Post readers late last month, said he will continue to subscribe to the Post to support the journalism of his former colleagues but acknowledged those who “understandably have canceled subscriptions to protest Bezos’s actions that have damaged the news organization’s integrity.” \n\n“When Bezos bought The Post, he provided needed money, energy and direction. The Post continues to produce first-rate journalism now, despite his morale-busting actions,” Davidson added. \n\nNeither Davidson nor The Washington Post responded to Fox News Digital’s requests for comment. \n\nOver the past year, The Washington Post was at the center of intense outrage from the left. \n\nThe first was in October when Bezos halted the paper’s endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the November election. \n\nThe second was in February when Bezos announced his directive for the Post’s editorial pages to promote “personal liberties and free markets” and vowed not to publish pieces opposing those principles. \n\nBoth instances sparked a mass exodus of paid subscribers and several resignations, including opinion editor David Shipley, who opposed Bezos’ new policy. \n\nLast month, the Post tapped Adam O’Neal, formerly of The Economist and The Wall Street Journal, to lead the opinion pages.","summary":"Joe Davidson's column \"was killed because it was deemed too opinionated under an unwritten and inconsistently enforced policy, which I had not heard of previously,\" he wrote","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/09/media/washington-post-columnist-quits-blames-bezos-for-editorial-constraints/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/107892955.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-09 18:10:24","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.268},{"id":339958758,"title":"Republicans navigate post-victory agenda after Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' becomes law","text":"What do they do now? The One, Big, Beautiful Bill is law. Congressional Republicans and the Trump administration stuffed every legislative initiative imaginable (that would mesh with Senate budget rules) into the package. Now Republicans must figure out what to tackle during the remaining 18 months of the 119th Congress. There are always subjects on which the GOP wants to focus and legislate. But after approving the hallmark of President Trump’s legislative agenda, there are frankly not a lot of other big items rolling down the parliamentary pike. RACE AGAINST TIME: HOW CONGRESS BARELY MADE JULY 4 DEADLINE ON ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ But we’ll focus on a few that are important to the GOP – and could make headlines. The first big project comes next week. A \"rescissions\" bill is due in the Senate. A \"rescission\" is a request by the administration to cancel spending that Congress had already appropriated. Congress approved an interim spending bill in March to avoid a government shutdown, but a few months later, White House Budget Director Russ Vought sent a \"rescissions\" request to Congress. Vought hoped to claw back $9.4 trillion in spending for USAID and public broadcasting. BIDEN'S DOCTOR ARRIVES FOR CLOSED-DOOR INTERVIEW IN HOUSE HEALTH PROBE The House barely approved the package, 214-212, last month. Flip one vote and the bill would have failed. Now, it’s up to the Senate to align with the House. Senators must do so before a July 18 deadline. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., noted that the measure was \"subject to amendments.\" A change to the plan means the Senate would have to bounce it back to the House to sync up. And the administration hopes to do multiple rescissions plans this year. So if the House and Senate can’t even trim a few billion dollars from what the GOP considers low-hanging fruit…. Cutting public broadcasting? Especially in rural areas? Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., who represents a sprawling state which still relies on radio in places, indicated that he’d like to see some changes to the rescissions package, especially in light of the flooding in Texas. \"Looking at radio stations in some of the rural areas that do a lot of emergency services,\" said Rounds. Without question, the biggest challenge facing Congress this fall – and next fall – is funding the government and avoiding a shutdown. Congress managed to avoid a shutdown in March – simply renewing all existing funding at the levels dictated by the Democrat-controlled Congress last year, and signed off by former President Biden. The only reason they avoided a shutdown was because Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., decided a shutdown was a worse option. So Schumer and several Democrats voted to assist the GOP overcome a filibuster – and keep the government lights burning. Democrats railed against Schumer for essentially helping bail out Republicans and getting nothing in return. Some called on him to step aside. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and other Democrats seethed at Schumer’s maneuver. Schumer can probably only go to that well once. One wonders what Schumer could possibly extract from Republicans and President Trump – who aren’t exactly ready to deal – even though they lack the votes to fund the government themselves. Moreover, it’s unclear if a government funding measure of any sort can even make it through the House with just GOP votes. Remember that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., promised conservatives that they would do funding bills one by one when he secured the speakership in October 2023. After all, that was the knock against former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Johnson managed to advance some spending bills last year, but the path to doing all 12 spending bills before the Oct. 1 deadline is narrowing. The House Appropriations Committee has readied several spending packages through the spring and early summer, but none are ready for the floor. What’s the magic potion for funding the government on time this year? Well, the question is whether Johnson can again keep his coalition together and convince conservatives to approve yet another interim spending measure. And, since it’s about the math, they absolutely must have assistance from Schumer and Senate Democrats to avoid a filibuster yet again. Some of this will boil down to what President Trump wants. The easy path is simply re-upping the old Biden/Democrats’ money (again) for a short period and then hammering out a broader spending pact later in the fall or before Christmas. But that doesn’t change the numbers in the House and Senate. And guess what? They have to do this all again by Oct. 1, 2026. There are also expectations – and some promises – of GOP leaders advancing another \"reconciliation\" package full of items they weren’t able to stuff into the Big, Beautiful Bill. A \"reconciliation\" measure must deal with fiscal issues – not policy. It must also not add to the deficit over a decade. So, expect Republicans who didn’t score certain savings items in the Big, Beautiful Bill to push for provisions in this package. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., has been among the most vocal advocates for two bills. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., even pushed for two reconciliation packages over the winter. He preferred a plan focused on beefing up the military and the border. Graham then wanted GOPers to turn to a bill to cut spending and accomplish many of the goals outlined by the Big, Beautiful Bill. In fact, the Senate’s initial budgetary framework – adopted in February – focused on the border and military. What else is at stake? Well, Republicans are simultaneously looking backwards – and forwards. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., is conducting an inquiry into what former Biden officials knew about the cognitive state of the former president. Republicans want to prevent future presidents from relying on staff if they are potentially out of it. The GOP wants to construct legislative remedies to address a potential future executive who can’t handle the job. But we’ve been down this road before. Edith Wilson practically acted as president after Woodrow Wilson suffered a stroke. The press corps was complicit in hiding the physical condition of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the 1930s and 1940s. Addressing a future impaired executive is a worthy exercise, but gazing backwards may be problematic for the GOP. Republicans don’t really have a good Democratic foil right now. Biden provides that. And so while the GOP focused on investigating the Bidens in 2023 and 2024, they’re going back to the same well again. It also doesn’t hurt Republicans politically to find out what former Vice President Kamala Harris knew. Same with former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Both are flirting with a 2028 presidential bid. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This comprises much of the agenda for lawmakers over the coming months. The midterms will be here soon enough. Most anything else will likely pale in comparison to the Big, Beautiful Bill. And with the touchstone of President Trump’s agenda now signed into law, Democrats are now determining how to weaponize it against Republicans in the fall of 2026. Most of the legislative agenda is in the books. So what do they do now?

Tim Walz as her running mate, a decision widely panned by pundits in retrospect. \"2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America,\" released Tuesday by journalists Josh Dawsey of The Wall Street Journal, Tyler Pager of The New York Times and Isaac Arnsdor of The Washington Post, described a vetting process that came down to three finalists: Walz, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. All three candidates did a final interview with Harris at her residence, the book explains, adding that when asked what they wanted to drink, Shapiro and Kelly chose water while Walz chose Diet Mountain Dew. Appeal with rural voters was a top priority for the Harris ticket and the book states that Harris’s advisors felt that Walz was the best candidate to do that. TIKTOKER KNOCKS HARRIS' 'WEIRD' TAKE ON NEVER RELEASED INTERVIEW: 'NOT GOOD' \"Pelosi privately pushed for him too, because she’d worked with him in Congress,\" the book said about the former House speaker. \"The pitch for Walz was straightforward: He could appeal to white voters across the Blue Wall states (Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania) and hopefully help Harris with male voters. He’d never lost election.\" While most political experts felt Shapiro, governor of a key swing state, was the most logical choice, the book states that the interview with Harris and Shapiro \"revealed the two were not a perfect match.\" \"He came across as overly ambitious, pushing Harris to define what his role would be. He also conceded it would not be natural for him to serve as someone’s number two, leaving Harris with a bad impression,\" the book states. Conversely, the authors explain that Walz was \"deferential\" while \"showing no interest in himself\" and \"flatly denied any interest in running for president.\" NANCY MACE BLASTS TIM WALZ AFTER HE FAILS TO DEFINE WHAT A WOMAN IS \"He went so far as to proactively volunteer reasons why she might not want to pick him,\" the book says. \"In his interview that Friday, he said he had never used a teleprompter before. On Sunday, he told Harris, ‘I would understand if you went with someone else because I’m really nervous about the debate, and I don’t think I’ll do well.’ Still, the vetting team did not fully appreciate his tendency to misspeak, his folksiness sometimes tipping into factual imprecision.\" Walz would ultimately draw intense scrutiny on the campaign trail for his \"folksiness\" with a series of blunders, including his characterization of his military service and a claim he was present at the Tiananmen Square massacre. The book says Harris \"struggled\" deciding between Shapiro and Walz, believing that she had a better \"rapport\" with Walz but understood the importance of Pennsylvania. Harris’ team, according to the book, told her that polling did not offer a clear answer as to which of the two candidates would help the ticket more. \"There was no empirical evidence that Shapiro would deliver Pennsylvania and with it the White House,\" the book said. As Shapiro was being considered, many pundits speculated that his staunch support of Israel could be an issue given the progressive wing of the Democratic Party being vocally pro-Palestinian, resulting in protests, sometimes violent, across the country after Oct. 7. The book said the Harris campaign was aware of that issue. \"Much of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party declared war on Shapiro, largely because of his support of Israel,\" the book said. \"Some Shapiro allies saw the criticism as deeply unfair and borderline antisemitic, since the governor was an observant Jew, but his positions on the Palestinian conflict broadly aligned with the Biden administration and the other vice presidential contenders. The lawyers vetting Shapiro did flag some comments they viewed as more incendiary, particularly as it related to pro- Palestinian protests on college campuses after the October 7 attacks.\" \"One that caught their attention was his commentary on CNN from April: ‘We have to query whether or not we would tolerate this, if this were people dressed up in KKK outfits or KKK regalia, making comments about people who are African American in our communities.’\" Ultimately, the book says Harris \"went with her gut\" and chose Walz believing he was the \"better fit\" in a decision her staff was \"unanimously behind.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the offices of Walz and Shapiro for comment. After losing every battleground state and ultimately the presidency to Donald Trump, critics were quick to judge the Walz pick as a misstep by Harris. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The choice of Walz was only one of many disastrous mistakes but symptomatic of one larger problem – the Democratic Party leadership is too scared to say no to the hard-left progressive wing of the party,\" Julian Epstein, longtime Democratic operative and former chief counsel to the House Judiciary Committee, told Fox News Digital shortly after the election. Rob Bluey, president and executive editor of The Daily Signal, told Fox News Digital in November that Harris picking Walz \"proved to be a disastrous decision that doomed Kamala Harris from the moment she made it.\" \"Not only was Walz ill-prepared for the national spotlight and media scrutiny, but Harris passed over several better options,\" Bluey said. \"Given how little Americans knew about Harris or her policy positions, they were right to question her judgment on this big decision.\"","summary":"A new book about Kamala Harris&apos; 2024 presidential campaign examines the thought process that went into selecting Minnesota Gov.

In addition, Obama was a former community organizer and Trump a retired real estate agent and business who came from a well-settled generational background a wealth since his Fred Trump Sr., was the “biggie” of the real estate market. \n\n“Obama is everything that Trump is not: intellectual, articulate, adroit, contemplative and cool,” @CharlesMBlow writes. “The fact that he could not only ascend to the height of power but also the heights of celebrity and adoration vexed Trump.” https://t.co/xbwQ7YGQ64\n— New York Times Opinion (@nytopinion) May 19, 2020\n\n“This is arguably the most extreme contrast we’ve ever seen between two successive presidents,” said NBC News presidential historian Michael Beschloss. “ Meanwhile, in a viral video, both the leaders were spotted smiling and engaging in an exchange at Jimmy Carter’s funeral despite their history of political differences. Many saw it as a cordial move from Obama’s side as body language experts tried to decode their chat. \n\nYet, Obama’s wife Michelle has continued to maintain her stance against Donald Trump as she condemned most of his ruthless policies since he took office in January 2025 to serve his second term. For instance, when Donald Trump outrageously claimed illegal immigrants were taking “Black jobs,” Michelle Obama couldn’t resist a shocking statement and said, “Who’s going to tell him the job he’s chasing might just be one of those?”\n\n“Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those ‘Black jobs’?”\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama criticized Donald Trump during her DNC speech for his history of attacking her and her husband, drawing applause from Democrats. pic.twitter.com/zoNHyfsUS0\n— The Associated Press (@AP) August 21, 2024\n\nIt’s funny to witness the pattern that Americans often choose a new president who starkly contrasts with the last. In 1992, Bill Clinton, a humble Democrat from Arkansas, replaced the patrician Republican George H.W. Bush 2000. Owing to the pattern, we are assuming the next president, whether elected in 2020 or 2024, will once again represent a noticeable difference from their predecessor.

Joe Davidson, who penned the Post's \"Federal Insider\" column for 17 out of his 20 years at the paper, took to his Facebook page and wrote a piece titled \"Quitting The Washington Post -- or did it quit me?\", telling readers having the esteemed title of \"Washington Post columnist\" was not worth keeping no matter the cost. \"For me, the cost became too great when a Federal Insider column I wrote was killed because it was deemed too opinionated under an unwritten and inconsistently enforced policy, which I had not heard of previously,\" Davidson wrote Tuesday. \"While the policy prohibiting opinion and commentary in News section articles can be justified journalistically, it is a departure from longstanding Post practice and mandated a change in my role that I chose not to accept.\" WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST TORCHES PARAMOUNT SETTLING WITH TRUMP OVER ‘60 MINUTES’ INTERVIEW While Davidson didn't believe Bezos was directly involved in his column being killed, he wrote \"it would be naïve to ignore the context.\" \"Starting before the November presidential election, Bezos’s policies and activities have projected the image of a Donald Trump supplicant,\" Davidson said. \"The result – fleeing journalists, plummeting morale and disappearing subscriptions. Since October, when Bezos blocked publication of a planned Post endorsement of Kamala Harris for president, the departure of Post talent has been shocking and included five former editors directly above me in the newsroom’s hierarchy. \"Nonetheless, Post coverage of Trump remains strong.

That’s when I learned just how severe the policy is,\" Davidson wrote. \"In my next piece, I was not allowed to describe a potential pay raise for federal employees as ‘well-deserved’ because of Post policy.\" \"As a columnist, I can’t live with that level of constraint. A column without commentary made me a columnist without a column. I also was troubled by significant inconsistencies in the implementation of the policy. During this period, The Post allowed stronger, opinionated language by other staffers, including the words ‘viciousness,’ ‘cruelty’ and 'meanness' to describe Trump’s actions,\" he continued. Davidson, who previously wrote a farewell piece to Post readers late last month, said he will continue to subscribe to the Post to support the journalism of his former colleagues but acknowledged those who \"understandably have canceled subscriptions to protest Bezos’s actions that have damaged the news organization’s integrity.\" \"When Bezos bought The Post, he provided needed money, energy and direction.

The first was in October when Bezos halted the paper's endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the November election. The second was in February when Bezos announced his directive for the Post's editorial pages to promote \"personal liberties and free markets\" and vowed not to publish pieces opposing those principles. Both instances sparked a mass exodus of paid subscribers and several resignations, including opinion editor David Shipley, who opposed Bezos' new policy. Last month, the Post tapped Adam O'Neal, formerly of The Economist and The Wall Street Journal, to lead the opinion pages.","summary":"Joe Davidson called it quits at The Washington Post after 20 years over growing editorial constraint he suggested stems from its billionaire owner Jeff Bezos.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/longtime-washington-post-columnist-quits-paper-slams-growing-editorial-constraints-under-bezos","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/10/931/523/f9b6d8ec-bezos-washington-post.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-09 15:05:36","author":"Joseph Wulfsohn","authors":["Joseph Wulfsohn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.332},{"id":340036446,"title":"Is bacon considered a spice?

Josh Riley, who so far has declined to publicly distance himself. Riley, who represents New York’s 19th Congressional District, which is ranked by the Cook Political report as \"Lean Democrat\" heading into next year’s midterms, \"dodged reporters\" on his stance on Mamdami in late June, Axios reported. \"Despite Mamdani being a completely out of touch radical, Josh Riley won’t condemn him,\" the National Republican Congressional Committee blasted out in an email the next day. \"Perhaps that’s because he agrees with Zohran Mamdani’s socialist agenda?\" Mamdani’s victory, on a platform consisting of a laundry list of far-left agenda items, including city-run grocery stores, defunding the police, safe injection sites and raising the minimum wage to $30, has highlighted a schism within the Democratic Party, with some elected officials supporting him and some condemning him. NEW YORK DEMOCRATS SAY MAYORAL CANDIDATE ZOHRAN MAMDANI 'TOO EXTREME TO LEAD' Fox News Digital reached out to Riley’s campaign for comment on specifically where he stands on Mamdani’s campaign but did not receive a response. \"Josh Riley won’t denounce dangerous socialist Zohran Mamdani because they share the same far-left agenda,\" NRCC spokeswoman Maureen O'Toole told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"His campaign is bankrolled by the exact same radical donors backing Mamdani.\" TRUMP TORCHES '100% COMMUNIST LUNATIC' MAMDANI, DEM BACKERS AFTER SHOCK NYC MAYORAL PRIMARY WIN A Fox News Digital review of FEC records did show some overlap between Riley and Mamdani donors, including over $10,000 in contributions to Riley from several individuals who also donated to Mamdani’s mayoral campaign.

Former VP Kamala Harris narrowly edged out President Donald Trump in 2024 in the district by a single percentage point.

(Pictures: Getty)\n\nFollowing catastrophic flooding in Texas, hopes of finding survivors have dimmed as the death toll passed 100 today. \n\n27 of those who died were children at summer camp, including two twin sisters who had just finished the second grade.\n\nWhile some families have yet to recover the bodies of their missing loved ones, many of whom just days ago were having the time of their lives at Camp Mystic, the tragedy is already being manipulated by those in power.\n\nDuring a recent press conference, White House Secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Democrats of turning the floods into a ‘political game’ – likely alluding to calls from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to investigate if ‘preventable failures’ contributed to the floods.\n\nShe added: ‘This is a national tragedy, and the administration is treating it as such. Blaming President Trump for these floods is a depraved lie, and it serves no purpose during this time of national mourning.’ \n\nThis isn’t the first time a climate disaster has been exploited by politicians to serve their own interests, with little regard for those who have suffered and lost loved ones – and it probably won’t be the last.\n\nComparisons to the scale of disaster and response from political leaders have already been made to the devastation in western North Carolina last September, after Hurricane Helene swept through, killing 251 people and destroying thousands of homes. \n\n More than a dozen young campers in Texas died in the historic flooding (Pictures: AP)\n\n Stuffed animals of missing campers have been placed on windowsills of their cabins (Picture: Reuters)\n\nAs walls of water moved quickly through small mountain towns, entire houses and businesses were wiped away in an instant, while hundreds of residents had little chance of escape. Almost a year later, the communities still haven’t recovered. \n\nImmediately after the disaster, Trump, who was in the midst of his re-election campaign, began spreading well-documented public lies and conspiracy theories, blaming President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the flood and lack of help.\n\nDuring one visit to the small North Carolinian town of Swannanoa in January, which suffered unprecedented damage, he told victims that the Biden government ‘failed’ them with funding. \n\nWhile Trump’s recent, sombre remarks following the floods in Texas are a far cry from his politically-motivated posts during Hurricane Helene, he still couldn’t resist placing blame on another politician, like many leaders before him.\n\n‘Melania and I are praying for all the families impacted by this horrible tragedy. God bless the families and God bless Texas,’ he posted, later adding: ‘If you look at that water situation, that was really the Biden setup.’\n\n To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n browser that\n supports HTML5\n video\n\n Up Next\n\n Previous Page\n\n Next Page\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Trump visited homeowners in North Carolina in January – using the opportunity to bash his predecessor (Picture: AP)\n\nBiden’s response to Hurricane Helene was also slammed for the ‘delayed’ response in giving aide to the hardest-hit regions from the storm. He was harshly criticised for his lack of urgency to visit North Carolina after the storm. \n\nThis delay from Biden infuriated Trump, who previously blamed Democrats for climate disasters. In early January, he blamed California’s governor for the unprecedented wildfires which burned much of Los Angeles – accusing him of prioritising ‘fish’ over more water in the state. \n\nWhile comments like these could appear as good-old-fashioned political mud-slinging, the real-world consequences have been felt for decades, often by some of America’s poorest regions. \n\nMonths after claiming that Biden had let the people of North Carolina down financially, the Trump Administration denied a request for millions of dollars worth of Hurricane Helene relief. \n\nFacing the truth\n\nThe question is, with extreme weather disasters growing more volatile as the burning of fossil fuels continues across America – and the globe – why do so many politicians prefer to point the finger rather than address the elephant in the room and actually do something?\n\n‘It’s not a simple story, but it’s a very American story. This is where we are,’ Lawrence Hamilton, a Professor of Sociology at the University of New Hampshire, tells Metro. \n\nAfter all, climate change-related extreme weather events have been found to disproportionately affect lower-income areas, further exacerbating already tough living conditions when disaster hits.\n\nWhen it comes to floods, historically, residents who live on higher ground are often better off than those in lower areas, which see the most damage.\n\nDuring Hurricane Katrina in 2005, areas at higher elevations in Louisiana, such as the wealthier French Quarter, only more minor flooding and damage.\n\nMeanwhile, the lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans was severely damaged when the levees broke, sending historic levels of water spilling into homes and killing more than a thousand people.\n\nAfter Katrina moved through, the debris left behind revealed just how real the intersection between poverty and geography is when it comes to weather disasters.\n\n Dozens of homes were ripped from their foundations and destroyed in the Lower Ninth Ward (Picture: AP)\n\n Wealthier areas, like the French Quarter, seen above, fared much better (Picture: Getty)\n\nPerception vs reality\n\nDespite tragic floods, wildfires and climate disasters seen in Texas, North Carolina, California and across the country, many Americans simply ‘aren’t perceiving’ the patterns at play which worsen weather.\n\n‘For instance, out West, where wildfires are common, people know it’s bad. They often perceive that they’re getting worse, but they do not accept any of the science about why they might be getting worse, or they only accept the parts of it that fit with their sociopolitical views,’ explains Professor Hamilton.\n\n‘There’s a theory in social science called elite cues – it’s the idea that you know what to believe because your leaders have told you that it goes with your identity. \n\n‘Some places are much harder hit, and the impact is harder to overlook, but in other areas, oftentimes, even just the perception of whether it happened or not is being disputed.’\n\nAfter Helene destroyed western North Carolina, rumours of ‘space lasers’ controlling the weather ran rampant online. \n\nIn the aftermath of the Texas floods, some people began blaming the victims. In one viral TikTok, a woman suggested the campers (who were children) at Camp Mystic ‘deserved’ to die because the state voted for Trump.\n\n Warped perceptions of reality come from deep-rooted convictions, Hamilton says (Picture: Reuters)\n\n At the core of these events, real people are hurting (Picture: AP)\n\nThese warped perceptions of reality come from deep-rooted convictions, Professor Hamilton adds, that often change the person’s view of what actually happened.\n\n‘People’s belief systems can overwrite their perceptions of physical reality, so they remember things differently or interpret them in radically different ways,’ he explains.\n\n‘The climate is changing, and there are layers of scientists who are studying and anticipating it. The National Weather Service was watching the storm develop and issuing warnings.’\n\nYet, Professor Hamilton points out, at the same time, the National Weather Service lost 600 of its staff in the past few months due to budget cuts from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nIt’s unclear if cutbacks directly contributed to potential missteps in warning of the Texas floods, but Professor Hamilton adds: ‘There’s a whole layer cake of different things, different failures, really, in this cascade.’\n\nThe issue is, when there’s blame to aim at the expense of the competition, will American politicians ever take the literal higher ground and look at why this is happening and how to stop it, rather than who is at fault?\n\nUntil then, the reality is that for every social media post filled with thoughts and prayers and a little dig on the side, the most vulnerable lives will continue to be lost, and our world will carry on burning, with victims picking up the pieces of their lives. \n\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our news page.","summary":"For every social media post filled with thoughts and prayers, the most vulnerable lives will continue to be lost, and our world will carry on burning. ","url":"https://metro.co.uk/2025/07/09/blame-thoughts-prayers-uncomfortable-truth-politicians-natural-disasters-23619759/","image":"https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SEC_258414165-2cfe.jpg?quality=90&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-09 13:58:39","author":"Sarah Hooper","authors":["Sarah Hooper"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.236},{"id":339903634,"title":"Donald Trump reveals his special role at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup final on Sunday","text":"UEFA Europa Conference League winners Chelsea have reached the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup finalThe Premier League team will face the winner of the second semi-final between PSG and Real MadridHost country United States of America, President Donald Trump has confirmed his presence at the final\n\nUnited States of America President Donald Trump has confirmed his presence and what he will do at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup final on July 13, 2025.\n\nChelsea beat Brazilian club Fluminense in the semi-final and will face the winner of the second match between Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid later tonight.\n\nThe winner of the match at the MetLife Stadium, New Jersey, on Sunday will be crowned champions of the expanded tournament and wear a gold badge on their jersey for four years.\n\nTrump confirms presence at CWC final\n\nUS President Trump has confirmed that he will be in attendance at the final at the MetLife Stadium on Sunday, a year after a failed assassination attempt on him in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n“I’ll be going to the game,” Trump told reporters at the White House, as quoted by Daily Mail.\n\nThe 45th and 47th president of the United States also hinted that he will present the trophy, which has been at the Oval Office after its unveiling, to the winner.\n\n“Yeah, I'm going to deliver it.

Biden, as well as former first lady Jill Biden, made a series of calls to White House officials and campaign staffers July 21, 2024, that he was set to announce he was dropping out of the race, including calls to then-Vice President Kamala Harris and chair of the campaign Jen O’Malley Dillon just hours before the news went public, according to the book \"2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America,\" which was published Tuesday. O'Malley Dillon reportedly took the news in tears before she called a campaign deputy to ready a public announcement on the election exit, the book reported. BIDEN AIDES PUSHED FOR EARLY DEBATE TO SHOW OFF BIDEN’S ‘STRENGTH,’ EXPOSE TRUMP’S ‘WEAKNESS,’ BOOK SAYS \"O’Malley Dillon called one of her deputies, Rob Flaherty, but he didn’t pick up,\" the book claims of that hectic Sunday afternoon. \"He was walking in Wilmington’s Alapocas Run State Park with his wife, Carla Frank, who oversaw the campaign’s surrogate operation. The two were talking about the state of the campaign and speculating about what might happen if Biden did drop out. About midway into their hike, Frank started to scale a rock wall, and Flaherty looked down at his phone. He saw the missed call from O’Malley Dillon, swore, and called her back.\" \"In forty-five minutes, we’re going to post a letter and it says that he’s going to drop out,\" she told him. \"You can’t tell anybody. Can you get to a computer?\" Flaherty said he could be at his computer in 30 minutes, but O'Malley Dillon needed him online sooner, according to the book. ART OF THE SURGE: BEHIND THE SCENES ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ROAD BACK TO WHITE HOUSE The book detailed that Flaherty did not have access to the campaign's social media accounts despite overseeing \"the campaign’s digital efforts,\" and called on a 24-year-old staffer to assist with the massive announcement. \"Flaherty oversaw the campaign’s digital efforts but did not have access to the social media accounts,\" the book detailed. \"He never actually posted from them. O’Malley Dillon asked if he had someone he trusted who could hit publish. Flaherty did. His name was Parker Butler, a twenty-four-year-old social media whiz. O’Malley Dillon approved, and Flaherty called Butler.\" The book continued of the pair's reported conversation: \"'Are you near a computer?' he said. ‘I’m going to send you a letter in about thirty minutes. I need you to post it in forty-five minutes on Twitter and Instagram and whatever.’ He didn’t tell him what the letter would say.\" Flaherty and his wife were, meanwhile, still attempting to find their way out of the woods during the dropout scramble and ultimately \"sprinted up a hill and called an Uber,\" according to the book. As Flaherty passed the letter announcing the drop out to Butler for publication, Biden held a Zoom meeting with White House staffers announcing the decision. BIDEN MADE HARRIS CAMPAIGN A 'NIGHTMARE,' DESTROYED HER CHANCES BY STAYING IN 2024 RACE TOO LONG, AIDES CHARGE \"Flaherty was in the Uber when he received the letter and passed it to Butler, around 1:35,\" the book found. \"Around the same time, senior White House and campaign staff received an invite for a Zoom, at 1:45. As the staff logged on, Butler hit send on the letter.\" \"Biden, with his camera off, told his team that he had decided not to run for reelection,\" the book continued. \"Among those finding out for the first time was Anita Dunn, who’d been one of the campaign’s top officials. Biden said a letter would be shared with the public shortly. It was already online.\" Biden announced his departure from the race via the letter that was posted to his social accounts at 1:46 p.m. July 21, 2024.

Elon Musk says the recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill’s excessive spending levels have compelled him to become a political spoiler. He’s forming the America Party as a “moderate” voice for fiscal sanity.\n\nIt’s correct to say elected Democrats and many Republicans aren’t serious about putting government on a diet. Talk of reductions always ends in a puff of smoke and mirrors, sending the national debt skyward.\n\n“The Republican Party has a clean sweep of the executive, legislative and judicial branches and still had the nerve to massively increase the size of government, expanding the national debt by a record five trillion dollars,” Mr. Musk wrote on his social media platform, X.\n\nIt sounds like he’s right, but, by the Treasury’s spreadsheets, he’s not. When Mr. Trump took the oath of office five months ago, the national debt was $36.2 trillion. Today, it’s still $36.2 trillion. Over the same period last year, President Joseph R. Biden had already saddled future generations with an extra $775 billion they’ll have to pay.\n\nMr. Musk circulated an image from a debt clock showing America is $37.1 trillion in arrears. That figure is off by a trillion. Citing bad data isn’t a good start for a political party.\n\nIt’s also true that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had to stop the clock. Uncle Sam’s accountants have been leaning on gimmicks like temporarily pilfering cash from federal retiree pensions to avoid busting the statutory limit. That said, a President Kamala Harris would have raised or ignored the debt limit long before now. \n\nCongress and the White House have limited power to alter the grim situation. Nearly three-fourths of the budget is on autopilot with mandatory payments like Medicare, Medicaid and interest on the national debt putting us on an unsustainable trajectory.\n\nYet Mr. Musk objected to the Big Beautiful Bill even though it will slash mandatory expenditures by kicking illegal aliens off the dole. The law’s tax reductions will also spark enough economic activity to offset the rising cost of government. Mr. Trump is also hinting he may replace Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell with someone more amenable to reducing interest rates.\n\nWhile Democrat-aligned federal judges thwarted the austerity measures Mr. Musk identified through the Department of Government Efficiency, that roadblock is finally clearing. If Mr. Musk thinks he could do a better job of navigating these constraints, he ought to explain how.\n\nThe Tesla CEO has only said he intends to apply “Extremely concentrated force at a precise location on the battlefield,” to affect 2 or 3 Senate races and 8 to 10 House races. “Given the razor-thin legislative margins, that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring that they serve the true will of the people.”\n\nDividing the conservative vote with third-party candidates only guarantees success for Democratic wastrels. Ross Perot’s quixotic 1992 campaign gave us Bill Clinton. Teddy Roosevelt’s Bull Moose bid put Woodrow Wilson in the Oval Office.\n\nFormer Speaker Newt Gingrich provides a much better example to follow. He put in the work to build a true conservative majority by running on a national platform that secured 54 additional House seats. The nation’s budget was balanced until the political tides shifted leftward.\n\nIf a man of Mr. Musk’s talents stays within the two-party system, he could shift the fiscal tide to the right. Anything else is mere puffery.","summary":"Musk&#39;s America Party- A recipe for Democrats&#39; dominance","url":"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jul/8/editorial-musks-america-party-recipe-democrats-dominance/","image":"https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/01/08/B1_Curl_AH1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-09 11:07:37","author":"Editorial Board","authors":["Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":340014764,"title":"We’ll never get tired of these scorching takedowns of the Maga who claimed there are no pronouns in the Bible","text":"Back in 2022, the then VP, Kamala Harris, gave her preferred pronouns at the start of a meeting, attended by blind people, to discuss the effects of the overturning of Roe v.

It’s the conditions. Can you imagine that?” \n\nTrump withdrew from Obama’s 2015 Iran nuclear deal and the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement in his first term, though it’s unclear if those pacts were what was being discussed.\n\n“Call me at the foy after, yep,” Trump told Obama, possibly referring to the National Cathedral’s foyer.\n\nObama responded, “can you just … it should be good.”\n\n“I can’t talk, we have to find a quiet place sometime. This is a matter of importance and we need to do this outside so that we can deal with it, certainly, today,” Trump said, as Obama nodded.\n\nTrump later said he “didn’t realize how friendly” Obama was until their exchange.\n\n“I said, ‘Boy, they look like two people that like each other.’ And we probably do,” Trump told NBC News from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida following the funeral.\n\nTrump was seated beside Obama in the second row of the National Cathedral because former first lady Michelle Obama was in Hawaii and didn’t attend the funeral because of “scheduling conflicts.”\n\nThe 61-year-old refused to attend Trump’s second inauguration inside the Capitol on Jan. 20.\n\nShe later claimed, part of the reason for not flying to Washington, DC, for the festivities was that she didn’t have the correct wardrobe.\n\n“It started with not having anything to wear,” Obama said in an April episode of her podcast, “IMO with Michelle Obama & Craig Robinson.” \n\n“I mean, I had affirmatively, cause I’m always prepared for any funeral, anything,” Obama added. “I walk around with the right dress, I travel with clothes just in case something pops off. So I was like, if I’m not going to do this thing, I got to tell my team, I don’t even want to have a dress ready, right? Because it’s so easy to just say, let me do the right thing.” \n\nPresident Obama attended the indoor ceremony by himself.\n\nHe has been outspoken on Trump’s policies, making rare public remarks, including after the commander in chief shut down the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)\n\n“Gutting USAID is a travesty, and it’s a tragedy,” Obama said in a video that was shown to departing USAID employees on June 30. “Because it’s some of the most important work happening anywhere in the world.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAccording to a new book, President Trump extended an invitation to President&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Extends an Invitation to Obama for Golf at His Course Amidst Jimmy Carter&#8217;s Funeral first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-extends-an-invitation-to-obama-for-golf-at-his-course-amidst-jimmy-carters-funeral/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Trump-invited-Obama-to-his-golf-course-during-Jimmy-Carter.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-09 10:28:24","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":339822684,"title":"Tesla's turmoil: Is Elon Musk's love-hate relationship with Trump derailing the EV empire?","text":"The involvement of Elon Musk in politics previously affected raised concerns among Tesla investors\n\nTesla's troubles go far beyond tech mogul Elon Musk's recent fallout with President Donald Trump, who accused the former “first buddy” of going “completely ‘off the rails’” after Musk announced he is floating America party. Tesla has been facing massive challenges trying to get back on track after a disastrous first quarter. While the battles between Musk and Trump are getting all the attention, the outlook for Tesla’s revenue and bottom line have gotten notably worse. This week, Tesla shares fell approximately 7 percent after Elon Musk, electric vehicle company CEO, announced his plans on social media to form a new political party amid his ongoing feud with Trump. This decline cost the company 68 billion in a day to become the most significant single-day drop since June 5, when shares of Tesla dropped more than 14% in heavy trading as the public feud between CEO Elon Musk and Trump intensified. The company lost about $150 billion in value after Trump and Musk began their verbal war.Musk stepped up criticism of the President Trump's massive tax legislation in the recent months, while Trump alleged Musk was upset, opens new tab because the bill takes away tax benefits for electric vehicle purchases.ALSO READ: US airports to undergo massive change as nearly two decade-old policy scrapped. Check detailsLive EventsWhen Tesla faced vandalismMusk was Trump's largest financial supporter during the 2024 election campaign as he poured millions and millions of dollars to ensure his win against former Vice President Kamala Harris. Elon Musk was a mainstay at Mar-a-Lago and the White House at the start of Trump’s second term and he also bagged a role with Trump announcing a new watchdog- Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in slashing the federal workforce and cutting costs. DOGE cut hundreds of thousands of jobs since its inception in January, thus mounting the public anger. The involvement of Elon Musk in politics previously affected raised concerns among Tesla investors. Tesla facilities across the US faced protests and vandalism in response to the political role Elon Musk, who owns the car manufacturer, played in the Trump administration. \"Tesla takedown\" protests raged across US and other Western countries owing to Musk's proximity with Trump. Anti-Tesla campaigns saw a sharp rise with repeated attacks and vandalism across the globe. With Tesla’s global EV deliveries falling 13% last quarter, questions were being asked about Elon Musk’s forays into the political space and close association with President Trump.ALSO READ: Florida-like 'Alligator Alcatraz' detention centers to come to your state in US? Trump drops hintEarlier this year, his close work with the Trump administration on the DOGE was seen by some as potentially damaging to Tesla's brand image. In May, Musk exited DOGE a move that had a positive impact on Tesla’s stock. Tesla shares jumped after CEO Elon Musk said over the weekend that he plans to be \"super focused\" on his businesses and return to \"spending 24/7 at work.\"Investors' perception that Musk was overly focused on his work leading the U.S. government's cost-cutting department, DOGE, instead of running the EV maker has dogged Tesla shares this year. The situation remains more or less same now as Musk's renewed involvement in politics is again causing concern among investors. Musk announced he was starting a new political party due to his displeasure with the tax and spending bill signed by Trump on Friday — and the barbs on their respective websites have only increased since then.Shares of Tesla closed Monday down 6.8 percent and there was a concern among investors implication of Musk’s latest political moves. This came despite his promises to focus on the company.ALSO READ: 'Horrific': Houston pediatrician fired over vile post suggesting Texas flood victims were Trump supporters“Very simply Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story,” wrote Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who’s known for being optimistic about the company.Ives put out a follow-up note Tuesday saying that the Tesla board should set ground rules to limit Musk’s political activities because the company is at a “tipping point” for its future.“Tesla is heading into one of the most important stages of its growth cycle with the autonomous and robotics future now on the doorstep and cannot have Musk spending more and more time creating a political party which will require countless time, energy, and political capital,” he wrote.Analysts at William Blair downgraded their rating on Tesla stock to “market perform” (neutral) and slashed their earnings forecast for the company. In a note to investors, analysts Jed Dorsheimer and Mark Shooter highlighted that Trump’s proposed legislation not only eliminates the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle buyers but also scraps financial penalties for automakers that fail to meet federal emissions standards.Those emissions fines had historically driven demand for “regulatory credits” — a lucrative revenue stream for Tesla, as traditional automakers were forced to buy credits from EV manufacturers to offset their own emissions. With the penalties gone, so is the incentive to buy those credits.ALSO READ: Student Loan Forgiveness programs to undergo massive changes under Trump 2.0. Are you at risk?William Blair noted that Tesla has generated $10.6 billion in revenue from the sale of federal and state regulatory credits since 2019. This revenue was often the difference between profit and loss for the company. Without it, Tesla would not have reported a positive annual net income until 2021 — and would have slipped back into the red in Q1 of this year, when net income plunged 71% year-over-year due to slumping global sales.Also, the company's taxi service is limited in date launching only in Austin, Texas. That puts Tesla behind the robotaxi service already offered in Austin and three other cities – San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix.Tesla’s robotaxi rollout has faced several hiccups, including one video showing a vehicle driving on the wrong side of the road for half a block, and another capturing a robotaxi slowly steering into a parked car.Elon Musk has touted plans to expand the service to more cities soon, but he hasn’t provided specific timelines. It also remains unclear when the Austin pilot will open to the public or when the company will no longer require human monitors in the front passenger seat.ALSO READ: Measles cases in US reach all-time high after disease was declared 'eliminated': Check symptoms and prevention tipsTesla's drop in salesTesla sales plunged nearly 50 percent in April in Europe, despite overall growth in the region's EV market, as per data released in May by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. In Europe, sales plunged nearly 50% in April, despite overall growth in the region's electric vehicle market, as per data released in May by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.

Chinese automaker BYD is poised to surpass Tesla in global annual EV sales this year for the first time, even though Tesla is a still a major player in China, and BYDs are not sold in the US, reports CNN.Demand is expected to decline even more after October 1, when the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle buyers expires. When a similar incentive was phased out for Teslas in 2019, the company responded by slashing prices by nearly half the value of the discontinued credit.But Tesla is facing hurdles due to Musk's own wrongdoing. There has been backlash against Musk’s political activity, which has had a significant impact on Tesla sales.

Can you imagine that?” \n\nTrump withdrew from Obama’s 2015 Iran nuclear deal and the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement in his first term, though it’s unclear if those pacts were what was being discussed.\n\n“Call me at the foy after, yep,” Trump told Obama, possibly referring to the National Cathedral’s foyer.\n\nObama responded, “can you just … it should be good.”\n\n“I can’t talk, we have to find a quiet place sometime. This is a matter of importance and we need to do this outside so that we can deal with it, certainly, today,” Trump said, as Obama nodded.\n\nTrump later said he “didn’t realize how friendly” Obama was until their exchange.\n\n“I said, ‘Boy, they look like two people that like each other.’ And we probably do,” Trump told NBC News from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida following the funeral.\n\nTrump was seated beside Obama in the second row of the National Cathedral because former first lady Michelle Obama was in Hawaii and didn’t attend the funeral because of “scheduling conflicts.”\n\nThe 61-year-old refused to attend Trump’s second inauguration inside the Capitol on Jan. 20.\n\nShe later claimed, part of the reason for not flying to Washington, DC, for the festivities was that she didn’t have the correct wardrobe.\n\n“It started with not having anything to wear,” Obama said in an April episode of her podcast, “IMO with Michelle Obama & Craig Robinson.” \n\n“I mean, I had affirmatively, cause I’m always prepared for any funeral, anything,” Obama added. “I walk around with the right dress, I travel with clothes just in case something pops off.

Because it’s so easy to just say, let me do the right thing.” \n\nPresident Obama attended the indoor ceremony by himself.\n\nHe has been outspoken on Trump’s policies, making rare public remarks, including after the commander in chief shut down the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)\n\n“Gutting USAID is a travesty, and it’s a tragedy,” Obama said in a video that was shown to departing USAID employees on June 30. “Because it’s some of the most important work happening anywhere in the world.”","summary":"President Trump invited President Obama to play a round of golf at one of his several courses during the two's viral moment at President Carter's funeral in January, according to a new book.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/09/us-news/trump-invited-obama-to-his-golf-course-during-jimmy-carter-funeral/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/107861106.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/D5k96jGX-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-09 10:10:05","author":"Nicholas McEntyre","authors":["Nicholas McEntyre"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":339833828,"title":"Hochman restored 'normalcy' as L.A.'s top prosecutor. Can it last under Trump?","text":"When President Trump deployed the National Guard to quell protests last month against immigration raids unfolding across Los Angeles County, he claimed widespread lawlessness forced him to send in the troops. Days later, L.A. County Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman stepped in front of news cameras to announce charges against people who allegedly attacked police during the demonstrations. He avoided mentioning Trump or the swarms of masked federal agents descending on parks, workplaces and schools, but tried to push back against the White House's chaos narrative. Noting that the unrest was confined to a small section of downtown, Hochman promised to hold the lawbreakers accountable and disputed that Los Angeles was \"under siege.\" Reflecting on the moment in a recent interview with The Times, Hochman said he wanted to set the record straight without igniting a partisan dispute. \"What I’m hearing and reading and seeing is a political discourse that I have no interest in engaging in,\" he said. \"But one that is misstating what the factual context is on the ground.\" A former Republican who rebranded as an independent last year, Hochman promised to \"get politics out\" of the district attorney's office. He endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race but has stuck to his self-described \"hard middle\" since, focusing instead on restoring order to an office he criticized as being too chaotic under his predecessor. Now more than six months into Hochman's first term, prosecutors and law enforcement officials say the new district attorney has delivered \"a return to normalcy\" after the contentious term of progressive luminary George Gascón. By repealing nearly all of Gascón's sweeping policies, Hochman is allowing his prosecutors to mete out justice as they see fit, restoring a relative degree of harmony to an office that spent four years at war with itself. But Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement campaign is testing the limits of Hochman's neutrality. When immigration agents followed two women through an L.A. courthouse last month and arrested them, it drew outcries from nearly all corners of L.A.'s legal community. But not Hochman, whose strained diplomacy has raised eyebrows. “When the head prosecutor in the county doesn’t take a position, silence may appear to the community as support,\" said L.A. County Public Defender Ricardo Garcia. Hochman said that his office is not collaborating with the federal government on immigration enforcement and that he would prefer if immigration agents let state-level cases play out before taking action. “I’m doing my best to focus on my mission, which is public safety. There’s a lot of politics going on and a lot of noise above that mission, whether it’s the president squabbling with the governor, squabbling with the mayor or anybody else who wants to interject in the political discussions,\" he said. \"I’m going out of my way nowadays to keep our focus in this office on the public safety aspect.\" It was that focus that made Hochman speak up at the news conference. He recalled watching TV news and social media clips of the first weekend of protests that echoed Trump's proclamations that the city might burn down. “You’d swear to God, L.A. was under siege. I mean I got scared the first night,\" he said. \"I’m calling up my people and I’m saying, ‘Is this going on throughout the city and the county?’” Hochman's measured approach stands in contrast not only to Gascón's but also to his counterpart's at the federal prosecutor's office in Los Angeles. During a news conference on arrests of people who allegedly attacked police during last month's protests, Hochman calmly laid out the legal reasoning for the various prosecutions during the politically charged events. By comparison, U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli took the microphone minutes later and parroted Trump verbatim before pushing a long-held conservative suspicion about out-of-state agitators causing violence. Although Hochman talked as a candidate about crime in apocalyptic tones, took significant money from conservative megadonors and worked with fundraisers tied to Trump, his overhaul of the district attorney's office has not resembled the right-wing makeover some feared it would. If anything, Hochman's law and order orientation is in line with statewide voter shifts on criminal justice reform. Gone are Gascón's reformist policies discouraging the use of cash bail and limiting the use of sentencing enhancements. The death penalty is back on the table, although Hochman has not yet pursued it against a defendant. Six months into his term, data show Hochman is charging felonies at roughly the same rate Gascón did. Although the new district attorney vowed during his campaign to charge more juveniles as adults, so far he has pursued a total of five cases — the same number Gascón had at this time last year, according to a spokesperson for the office. After Hochman wiped out Gascón's ban on filing certain misdemeanors, prosecutors charged nearly 70% of all low-level cases presented by police in the first half of 2025, records show. Hochman says it's a necessary step to deter criminals, but Garcia and other advocates warn it puts more people at risk of deportation. Hochman says he's merely enforcing the law, and often presents himself as a man trying to get the trains back on time. In his downtown office, a framed silver age comic book sits by his desk, chronicling the adventures of \"Mr. District Attorney.\" Hochman laughs when describing the 1940s hero who seems to share his straight-ahead approach to the job. \"He doesn't have any superpowers,\" Hochman says. \"Turns out, he's just a really good lawyer.\" In an attempt to win over rank-and-file prosecutors, Hochman filled his administration with office veterans. And he's made a point of dropping in on trials large and small — from celebrity defendants to juvenile cases far from the headlines — to cheer on his staff. “We’ve seen a return to normalcy. We have a general understanding of what the expectations are of us,\" said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ryan Erlich, president of the union that represents most of Hochman's staff. \"We feel the upper management understands the job that we do, and it allows us to communicate and work on issues.” Good vibes aside, some of Hochman's decisions have rankled line prosecutors and led to political pitfalls. The office has been on the wrong end of several high-profile cases this year, leading some prosecutors to question why the district attorney's even-keel behavior tends to falter when the lights are on brightest. “He wants to be recognized, so he’s always involved in these high-profile cases,\" said one veteran deputy district attorney, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. \"Sometimes to the detriment of the case.” In January, Hochman announced he would not bring rape charges against rock star Marilyn Manson — roughly four months after he held a campaign event alongside some of Manson's purported victims to attack Gascón's handling of the case. \"You don’t parade people out. … I found that so deeply offensive,\" said Lenora Claire, a former member of the district attorney's office's victim advisory board. “What was that choice other than being completely irresponsible? He hadn’t reviewed the case.\" Hochman said the case was handled appropriately and prosecutors made a decision not to charge that was \"rooted in facts and the law, not a political agenda.\" Hochman's personal involvement in the resentencing hearings for Erik and Lyle Menendez, the brothers who killed their parents in a pair of brutal shotgun murders in 1989, also drew scrutiny. The brothers were each serving a life sentence with no hope of release until Gascón petitioned for their resentencing last year, a move Hochman opposed both on the campaign trail and then in court. Hochman's interactions with the Menendez family drew allegations of bias and his decision to transfer the prosecutors who filed Gascón's petition resulted in a civil suit. During one hearing in May, he personally took over arguments in the courtroom and said the brothers needed to show proper \"insight\" into their crimes, even after a judge repeatedly warned him it was legally irrelevant. The brothers were resentenced and could be released by the parole board later this year. Hochman defended his hands-on approach — and maintained he ultimately came out ahead. “When people say did you win or lose the Menendez case, I say we won. The defense was asking for immediate release through a voluntary manslaughter finding. The judge didn’t go there,\" Hochman said. After a campaign fueled by pro-law enforcement rhetoric, some defense attorneys say Hochman's election has emboldened prosecutors to become unnecessarily aggressive. \"They are focused more now on incarceration and high prison sentences, as opposed to probation and the opportunity for rehabilitation,\" attorney Damon Alimouri said. One of Alimouri's clients, Gerardo Miguel, is currently awaiting trial in a vandalism and burglary case after allegedly smashing his way into a Los Angeles home while screaming, \"call the police\" before hiding in the victim's bathroom, according to court records. No one was injured in the incident. Miguel did not steal anything, nor does he have a criminal record. Yet, Alimouri said, the district attorney's office's only plea offer would send his client to state prison. \"[The prosecutor] said, I’m concerned about the safety of the public, this guy could have done X, Y and Z,\" Alimouri said of the plea negotiation. \"But the fact of the matter is [my client] didn’t do X, Y and Z. He curled up in the fetal position and called for help.” Garcia, the public defender, also expressed frustration that Hochman's prosecutors have been fighting attempts to get defendants into the county's Rapid Diversion Program, which allows defendants to get treatment without taking on a criminal conviction. The program has a 90% success rate, according to Garcia. Hochman, who championed the use of some mental health diversion programs during his campaign, says it's a lack of county resources that limits the use of alternative justice programs. “We don’t have enough beds, anywhere in this county, for dealing with that whole population,” Hochman said. Allocating resources is the job of L.A. County's Board of Supervisors, a panel that leans heavily left. Hochman won't face reelection until 2028, and until then observers say his centrism could be an asset. “The advantage to being an independent is he can put the voters in the city before his political party,\" said Dan Schnur, who teaches political communications at the University of Southern California. \"Anyone with a D or an R next to their name comes under immense pressure to toe their respective party lines.\" Times staff writer Richard Winton contributed to this report.","summary":"A former Republican who rebranded as an independent, Nathan Hochman promised to 'get politics out' of the D.A.'s office, but his neutrality has raised eyebrows amid the immigration raids.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-09/nathan-hochman-los-angeles-district-attorney","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/84f99ee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8063x4233+0+475/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F57%2F35%2F71e9c50c4ef08d45dce5ea570233%2F1511530-me-nathan-ho","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-09 10:00:00","author":"James Queally","authors":["James Queally"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.036},{"id":339932954,"title":"Nebraska’s Billionaire Senator Voted for Hospital Carnage","text":"Dan Osborn, the independent Senate candidate from Nebraska who gave Republicans some headaches last year, outpacing Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign more than any non-Republican senator in the country, is coming back for another try, challenging Sen. Pete Ricketts (R-NE) for Nebraska’s other Senate seat. As in 2024, there will be no Democratic candidate in the race, according to state Democratic Party chair Jane Kleeb. So Osborn will have a shot in a more treacherous year for Republicans to take down Ricketts.\n\nThe announcement video for Osborn literally begins with a scripted radio report, noting that “Billionaire politician Pete Ricketts votes for historic tax cut for the 1 percent.” The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) is front and center in Osborn’s messaging, as it will be in races against Republicans all over the country. The political moment and the pushback to the law fits with the populist stances Osborn took last year and wants to take again.\n\nI “love the ideas America is supposed to stand for, and right now, I feel like that is under threat from corporations and billionaires carving it up for themselves,” Osborn told Michelle Goldberg of The New York Times.\n\nOsborn will be able to use the fact that the first hospital closure as a result of OBBBA is right in his home state.\n\nCommunity Hospital, a regional network in Nebraska with four treatment centers and clinics, announced last week that the medical center located in the town of Curtis, population 900, would have to shut down. “The current financial environment, driven by anticipated federal budget cuts to Medicaid, has made it impossible for us to continue operating all of our services, many of which have faced significant financial challenges for years,” Community Hospital said in a press release.\n\nA presentation by a community organizing group called United Today Stronger Tomorrow predicted the closures of six hospitals “in a critical financial state” in Nebraska as a direct result of OBBBA’s passage. The legislation cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next decade, through enrollment hurdles that will kick an estimated 11.8 million off the rolls and cuts to various schemes states use to get more money for their Medicaid systems. Rural hospitals are generally more dependent on Medicaid than their counterparts and will suffer disproportionately as a result of the law.\n\nThough some media narratives presume that, because of the delays of some of the changes to Medicaid, the real pain will only come after the midterm elections, this neglects the fact that hospitals budget several years in advance to plan for maintenance, staffing, equipment needs, and so on. If one will certainly collapse after 2026, it may just close up now. That was clearly the case for the Curtis Medical Center, and already there are rumblings about other imminent closures.\n\nThis will further strain a creaky health care system in Nebraska. Of the 93 counties in the state, 66 are experiencing a “severe” shortage of primary care physicians, and 88 have a shortage of mental health providers, according to the Rural Health Information Hub. The Nebraska Hospital Association announced last week that 44 percent of the rural hospitals in the state are losing money. The Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform calculates that nearly half of all rural hospitals in Nebraska have lost services in the past decade, and that 18 percent are at risk of closure.\n\nA provider tax increase recently passed by the Nebraska legislature would boost funding for hospitals, but thanks to OBBBA, those federal matching dollars are now scheduled to be cut nearly in half between 2028 and 2032.\n\nThe stress on the health care system will impact the working people Osborn is creating his campaign around; not only those in communities that lose a hospital, but those in neighboring communities facing an influx of new, often uninsured patients from newly created medical deserts, causing increased wait times and overcrowding. Given that OBBBA passed the Senate 51-50, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie, it’s fair to say that Ricketts delivered the deciding vote putting this into motion.\n\nIt doesn’t hurt that, as Osborn noted in his launch video, his opponent Pete Ricketts is a literal billionaire, the son of the founder of brokerage firm TD Ameritrade and a part owner of the Chicago Cubs. Ricketts is a former governor of Nebraska who was appointed to the Senate when Ben Sasse left; he won a special election to fill out Sasse’s term rather easily last year.\n\nBut Osborn may not be so easy to defeat. He lost to Sen. Deb Fischer (R-NE) last year by 6.7 points, when in the same election Donald Trump destroyed Kamala Harris in the presidential race in Nebraska by 20.5 points. If the electorate swings six or seven points in the 2026 midterms, in other words, Osborn would be in position to notch the upset.\n\nAnd he’s using Ricketts’s comfortable lifestyle against him. Ricketts “got his money the fast way, from his billionaire family,” Osborn narrates in the launch video. “Wall Street Pete bought his Senate seat. And what’s he done? Whatever is best for Pete. He made $10 million off the stock market in one month this year.”\n\nOsborn is a steamfitter and union leader who had never been to Washington until deciding to run for Senate last year, after leading a successful strike at a Kellogg plant in Omaha.\n\nOne of the primary issues animating Osborn’s campaign will be the cost of living. A new law that will likely increase the costs of electricity and higher education, while causing not just higher costs but lower quality in health care, presents a good foil for Osborn’s message.\n\nOsborn is planning a late-July kickoff at the Steamfitters Union Hall in Omaha with musician Conor Oberst, better known as Bright Eyes.","summary":"Now independent union leader Dan Osborn, who nearly won a U.S. Senate race in 2024, is vying for his seat.","url":"https://prospect.org/politics/2025-07-09-nebraskas-billionaire-senator-voted-for-hospital-carnage-dan-osborn/","image":"https://prospect.org/downloads/23198/download/David-NE%20Osborn%20070925.jpg?cb=90095d9b49529e1dc2089b36eb95ae90&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-09 09:30:00","author":"David Dayen","authors":["David Dayen"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.044},{"id":339784972,"title":"'Workaholic' director wins £190,000 payout for being sacked for 'ill-health' after suffering a heart attack","text":"Black Friday\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nPrince Harry\n\nKing Charles III\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Jul 9th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy this moment BROKE Wimbledon's AI line judge as SW19 bosses face new controversy over ball boy blame game amid star's call to stop the 'machines'\n\nChristian Horner is SACKED by Red Bull, a year on from sex texts scandal\n\nTeenager dies from 'brain-swelling' bat virus in India as officials confirm second case - fuelling fears of 'next pandemic'\n\nJohn Barrowman makes astonishing gay 'cover-up' claim against the BBC - and says corporation was full of homosexual men 'married to women': RICHARD EDEN'S DIARY\n\nI visited the home of mushroom murderer Erin Patterson to try and find out exactly what drove her to carry out her brutal killings.

Email: poppy.gibson@mailonline.co.uk \nBy POPPY ATKINSON GIBSON \n Published:10:04 BST, 9 July 2025 |Updated:10:06 BST, 9 July 2025 \n\nA 'workaholic' company director won almost £190,000 after bosses saw his health issues as an 'inconvenience' and sacked him.\nOperations director Darron Blewitt, from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, was expected to 'get on with the job' after suffering cardiac arrest, which left him with a brain injury and impaired memory and cognitive skills.\nA tribunal heard the 'deeply unhappy' senior recruitment firm executive at Mach Recruitment was 'left to his own devices' after the heart attack, until he was eventually dismissed over his 'alleged incapacity'.\nHe successfully sued the company for unfair dismissal and disability discrimination, winning £187,585.43, with a judge finding that Mr Blewitt was 'cast aside in a perfunctory way'.\nThe tribunal, held in Cambridge, heard that Mr Blewitt worked as the Southern Regional Operations Director for the recruitment company, which is based in Leeds.\nMr Blewitt had worked in recruitment for 22 years and described himself to the tribunal as a 'workaholic'.\nIn February 2020, he suffered a cardiac arrest, which left him with a hypoxic brain injury.\nThe judge heard that while he regained his mobility and speech following the heart attack, his memory and cognitive skills had been 'adversely affected'.\n\nOperations director Darron Blewitt, from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, suffered a cardiac arrest which left him with a brain injury and impaired memory and cognitive skills\n\nA tribunal heard he was 'left to his own devices' after the heart attack, until he was eventually dismissed over his 'alleged incapacity'\n\nMr Blewitt successfully sued Mach Recruitment for unfair dismissal and disability discrimination, winning £187,585.43\nIn October of that year, he returned to work, but the panel heard this was a 'challenging transition for him' due to the significant change in working practices after Covid.\nThe panel heard of issues in the business's treatment of Mr Blewitt, who experienced significant fatigue and anxiety after returning to work.\nIt was heard that he was essentially 'left to his own devices' and was expected to 'get on with the job'.\nThe tribunal said that he was assigned work at sites - like supermarket Sainsbury's and online fast fashion chain Boohoo - but was essentially 'supernumerary', as there was already a manager working there.\nHe described feeling 'deeply unhappy' and 'abandoned' by the recruitment agency, who failed to provide him with a 'calm and quiet working environment'.\nIt was heard that Katie Barrett - head of HR for Mach Recruitment - would often cancel meetings with him and she did not respond to emails from occupational health in relation to the senior employee.\nIn September 2022, Mr Blewitt was contacted by Mr Barrett, who told him he would be 'let go' following a decision to reduce headcount in the senior team, the tribunal heard.\nBosses attributed this to a 'downturn in business and negative press coverage', after it emerged the firm had allegedly not been paying staff.\n\nHe described feeling 'deeply unhappy' and 'abandoned' by the recruitment agency, who failed to provide him with a 'calm and quiet working environment'\n\nMr Blewitt was told he was being made redundant with immediate effect for 'ill-health' but Employment Judge Roger Tynan said the business had 'acted unreasonably\n\n WFH employee claimed she'd worked five hours when she had really logged on for 11 minutes \nWhen Mr Blewitt asked Ms Barrett whether he was being made redundant, she told him she'd call him back and hung up the phone.\nMr Blewitt did not hear anything for two days until he was invited to a Teams call and told that he was being dismissed with immediate effect for 'ill-health'.\nEmployment Judge Roger Tynan said the business 'acted unreasonably in relying upon his ill-health as sufficient reason for dismissing him'.\nMr Blewitt took the agency to an employment tribunal, alleging unfair dismissal and disability discrimination.\nEJ Tynan said there was a 'wholesale failure' on the part of Mach Recruitment to adhere to the ACAS employment code of practice.\nThe tribunal ruled that Ms Barrett's treatment of Mr Blewitt was 'undoubtedly unwanted' and said she 'harassed' him.\nThey noted that she may have been acting upon advice by senior staff, but said that due to the lack of evidence they are not able to explore this.\nEJ Tynan upheld Mr Blewitt's complaints of unfair dismissal, disability discrimination.\nEmployment Judge Tynan said: 'I conclude that [Mr Blewitt] was dismissed because [Mach Recruitment] found his health-related issues time-consuming and difficult to manage and was unwilling to invest the necessary time and effort in that regard.\n'The fact that [Mach Recruitment] never documented its concerns in writing, failed to document or minute any meetings or discussions with [Mr Blewitt] and did not even confirm his dismissal in writing, points to an organisation that was entirely neglectful of its responsibilities in the matter.\n'I conclude that [Mr Blewitt] was perceived as an inconvenience to the business and that stereotypical assumptions were made regarding his ongoing ability to perform his role and contribute.\n'In particular, I find that following his brain injury he was perceived by [Mach Recruitment] to no longer be a suitable fit in terms of its established operating model of a flexible, agile, essentially self-sufficient workforce.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \n'Workaholic' director wins £190,000 payout for being sacked for 'ill-health' after suffering a heart attack\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy AMELIA WYNNE and BRIAN GALLAGHER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:09:28 BST, 9 July 2025 |Updated:10:00 BST, 9 July 2025 \n\nThe new Superman movie has been met with a sea of just two star reviews as critics are unconvinced of the first foray into the newly-branded DC Universe - as the director faces backlash for calling the Man of Steel an 'immigrant'.\nThe new film - directed by James Gunn and starring David Corenswet as the fictional superhero, with Rachel Brosnahan as precocious reporter Lois Lane - will go on general release from July 11. \nMany were skeptical of the film - the third new Superman reboot in just under two decades, following Brandon Routh in 2006's Superman Returns and Henry Cavill in 2013's Man of Steel and 2017's Justice League.\nAnd now the reviews are out it seems they were right to be skeptical as it has failed to impress most critics.\nIt comes as Gunn has garnered controversy ahead of the film's widespread release Friday, likening the Man of Steel to an immigrant.\nGunn, 58, told The Sunday Times of London on Friday that he felt the character - played by Corenswet, 32, in the new movie - had a lot in common with immigrants who come to the America in search of a better life.\n\nThe new Superman movie has been met with a sea of just two star reviews as critics are unconvinced of the first foray into the newly-branded DC Universe\n\nThe new film - directed by James Gunn and starring David Corenswet as the fictional superhero, with Rachel Brosnahan as precocious reporter Lois Lane - will go on general release from July 11\n'I mean, Superman is the story of America,' Gunn told the news outlet. 'An immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, but for me it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost.'\nThe Times gave it a negative two star review calling it a 'migraine of a movie' but did praise the leading man.\nReviewer Kevin Maher wrote: 'David Corenswet is serviceable as Hollywood's latest Man of Steel, but director James Gunn has turned the ninth big-screen film into an indigestible mush.'\nHe wasn't positive about Gunn's efforts either, adding: 'Gunn approaches the nerdosphere's most celebrated property like a giddy amnesiac who has missed the precipitous rise and fall of multi-character Marvel superhero movies and is instead stuck somewhere in the early 2010s.'\nThe Guardian was equally as scathing, also giving it two stars and branding it a 'dim reboot'.\nReviewer Peter Bradshaw wrote: 'The Man of Steel – played with square-faced soullessness by David Corenswet – has an uninteresting crisis of confidence in Gunn's cluttered, pointless franchise restarter.' \nHighlighting a tired format, he added: 'How many more superhero films in general, and Superman films in particular, do we need to see that all end with the same spectacular faux-apocalypse in the big city with CGI skyscrapers collapsing? \n\nThe Times gave it a negative two star review calling it a 'migraine of a movie' but did praise the leading man (pictured)\n\nThe Guardian was equally as scathing, also giving it two stars - branding it a 'dim reboot' (Rachel Brosnahan seen centre)\n\nNicholas Hoult (seen) is playing Lex Luthor in Gunn's Superman but he originally auditioned for the main role of Superman\n'They were fun at first … but the thrill is gone.'\nEmpire also gave it two stars, simply saying in its review that the film 'didn't work'. \nReviewer Sophie Butcher penned: 'The final act sinks into CGI chaos, with an unsatisfying climax, an eye-roll-inducing reveal, a restlessly intermittent tone, and an insistence on prioritising things and people we don't really care about over core characters.'\nShe did however have praise for leads Corenswet and Brosnahan saying they had 'clear chemistry' and adding that Brosnahan was 'spiky and engaging as Lois, breathing life into a role with minimal dimension otherwise.'\nThe BBC also gave it a largely negative review and just three stars saying it was 'glib and flimsy' and felt like 'an eccentric sci-fi B-movie'. \nReviewer Nicholas Barber wrote: 'It's a shame that Gunn didn't give his story more time to breathe. \n'It's a shame, in particular, that he didn't devote more time to showing us that Superman really is the paragon that his supporters keep saying he is.'\nThe film follows the Man of Steel as he tries to balance his life as mild-mannered reporter Clark Kent while also being the most powerful entity on the planet.\nThis version of Superman is already established in his profession, older than Tom Welling's portrayal on The CW's Smallville but also younger than Henry Cavill's version of the superhero in the previous DC films. \nThe film also brings in numerous other beloved characters from the DC Comics like Mister Terrific (Edi Gathegi), Metamorpho (Anthony Carrigan), Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion) and Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced), plus the beloved Crypto the Super-Dog.\n\nThe BBC also gave it a largely negative review and just three stars saying it was 'glib and flimsy' and felt like 'an eccentric sci-fi B-movie'\nWhile the budget has been reported to be $225 million, Gunn recently shot down rumors that his film needs a huge result at the box office.\n'This is not the riskiest endeavor in the world,' Gunn said to GQ.\n'Is there something riding on it? Yeah, but it's not as big as people make it out to be,' Gunn admitted.\n'They hear these numbers that the movie's only going to be successful if it makes $700 million or something and it's just complete and utter nonsense. It doesn't need to be as big of a situation as people are saying,' Gunn clarified.\nDavid Rooney from The Hollywood Reporter admitted the two-hour-nine-minute film did feel 'lumpy and overstuffed,' though he praised the film's tone and lead actors.\n'But what matters most is that the movie is fun, pacy and enjoyable, a breath of fresh air sweetened by a deep affection for the material and boosted by a winning trio of leads,' he wrote. \nThe Toronto Star critic Peter Howell called the film 'all over the place,' both geographically and narratively.\n'Gunn packs so many heroes, villains, creatures and incidents into his screenplay, it's as if he's presenting a preview of future DC Universe delights. That is, in fact, largely what he's doing. He seems to have forgotten that popcorn munchers want to see the story now, not tomorrow,' Howell adds. \nThe Los Angeles Times' Amy Nicholson offers a positive review, though she adds David Corenswet's title character is, 'a little stupid.'\n'This isn't quite the heart-soaring 'Superman' I wanted. But these adventures wise him up enough that I'm curious to explore where the saga takes him next,' she added.\nOne of the other negative reviews was from IndieWire's Dave Ehrlich, who admits that both David Corenswet as Superman and Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane are 'great,' but adds it 'overcorrects for the Zack Snyder era,' the last filmmaker who tackled the Man of Steel in several super-serious and dark movies.\n'Determined to restore a lightness to Superman without dancing around how dark things have gotten in his absence, Gunn's movie is too busy reacting to the world at hand to create one of its own,' Ehrlich writes.\nDeadline's Peter Hammond praised the film for having, 'something to say about who we are, what we are becoming, and what we should aspire to.'\nStill he admits that Gunn, 'might be trying to do too much here, basically throwing everything against the wall and hoping some of it sticks. More than enough does in this entertaining new direction, but at times suffers from overload.'\nIt comes after Gunn's comments likening the Man of Steel to an immigrant.\nThe filmmaker was subsequently asked by the outlet if he expected that the motion picture would be received differently in historically Democratic or Republican areas amid the current political climate in America. \n'Yes, it plays differently,' Gunn said in response. 'But it's about human kindness and obviously there will be jerks out there who are just not kind and will take it as offensive just because it is about kindness. But screw them.'\nThe Superman character is from a planet called Krypton who lands on earth after his parents send him away as a baby in a travel pod ahead of the planet's imminent destruction.\nThe baby, named Kal-El, grows up and goes by the identity of mild-mannered reporter Clark Kent when he is not Superman.\nGunn faced criticism from a number of media personalities, including Fox News' Greg Gutfeld, who said the filmmaker is operating with 'a woke shield' - and out of touch with what Americans really feel.\n'He's creating a moat of woke, enlightened opinion around him,' Gutfeld said of the St. Louis-born filmmaker. \nKellyanne Conway, who served under President Donald Trump during his first term, said that Gunn had missed the point of a trip to the movie theater being about escapism.\n'We don't go to the movie theater to be lectured to and to have somebody throw their ideology onto us,' Conway said, according to the New York Post.\nConservative personality Chris Stigall said the filmmaker was trying to confuse the issue with the words he used.\n'This guy Gunn says you're not an American if you don't support immigrants - well, of course, it's not about immigrants,' Stigall said. 'The issue is the word he left out - illegal - illegal immigrants and aliens. Isn't [Superman's] tagline 'Truth, justice, and the American way?''\nStigall added: 'Truth Justice, and the American Way, which I think [the hard left] long ago ditched [the phrase] 'American Way' because the hard left couldn't have an iconic superhero actually standing up for the country and saluting the country.\n'But I'm pretty sure, once upon a time, they used to associate that with Superman ... when did they ditch it?'\n\n Superman director called 'Superwoke' as he faces backlash for calling the Man of Steel an 'immigrant' \nStigall said he believed DC Comics was leaned on by the hard left to distance the superhero from overtly nationalistic values - betraying the character's comic book roots. \n'I am sure at some point, the DC people were castigated by the Progressives and said, 'You got to ditch that American way stuff - Superman can't be American - and he certainly can't be pro American!'\nHe added, 'But I bet if you go back into comic book lore ... you will find a rich history of people producing comic books and comic book characters that were very, very pro-America and the American spirit.'\nJames Gunn spoke with Variety about the backlash to the remarks at the film's premiere in Los Angeles on Monday.\nGunn said he didn't have 'anything to say to anybody' and wasn't there 'to judge people' he had a difference of opinion with.\nGunn reiterated, 'I think this is a movie about kindness and I think that's something everyone can relate to.'\nCast members were more vociferous in their defense of Gunn, who has a history of being well-liked by the actors he works with and fans of the franchises he's overseen - most notably Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. \nActor Nathan Fillion (Guy Gardner-Green Lantern) said of Gunn's critics, 'Aw, somebody needs a hug,' adding, 'Just a movie, guys.'\nThe director's brother Sean Gunn, who plays Maxwell Lord in the movie, took up for his sibling, saying that his reaction to the backlash was that Superman does indeed represent the immigrant population amid the politically-divisive times.\n'My reaction to is that it is exactly what the movie is about,' Sean Gunn said. 'We support our people, you know? We love our immigrants.\n\nThe film also brings in numerous beloved characters from the DC Comics like Mister Terrific (Edi Gathegi), Metamorpho (Anthony Carrigan), Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion) and Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced), plus the beloved Crypto the Super-Dog\n\nThe Empire review praised leads Corenswet and Brosnahan (seen) saying they had 'clear chemistry' and adding that Brosnahan was 'spiky and engaging as Lois, breathing life into a role with minimal dimension otherwise'\n\nGunn himself has been facing backlash for comments he made in an interview in The Sunday Times of London last week\n'Yes, Superman is an immigrant, and yes, the people that we support in this country are immigrants and if you don't like that, you're not American.\nSean Gunn concluded that 'people who say no to immigrants are against the American way.'\nJoining Corenswet, Fillion and Gunn in the cast of the motion picture are Rachel Brosnahan (as Lois Lane), Nicholas Hoult (as Lex Luthor), Isabela Merced (Hawkgirl), Milly Alcock (Supergirl).\nLimitless leading man Bradley Cooper plays the role of Superman's father Jor-El, the role famously commandeered by late Hollywood legend Marlon Brando; Oscar winning A-lister Russell Crowe; and venerated late actor Julian Sands in previous productions about the famed Man of Steel.\n\nSuperman: The Reviews \n\n'David Corenswet is serviceable as Hollywood's latest Man of Steel, but director James Gunn has turned the ninth big-screen film into an indigestible mush.'\nThe Guardian:\n\n'The Man of Steel – played with square-faced soullessness by David Corenswet – has an uninteresting crisis of confidence in Gunn's cluttered, pointless franchise restarter.'\n\n'The final act sinks into CGI chaos, with an unsatisfying climax.'\n\n'It's a shame that Gunn didn't give his story more time to breathe.'\nThe Toronto Star:\n'While filmmaker James Gunn's story of the Man of Steel dazzles visually, it's not without some problems.'\nThe Los Angeles Times:\n'This isn't quite the heart-soaring 'Superman' I wanted. But these adventures wise him up enough that I'm curious to explore where the saga takes him next.'\nJames GunnRachel Brosnahan\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSuperman's 'woke' reboot is branded 'pointless' and a 'migraine of a movie' by unimpressed critics - as director faces backlash for calling the Man of Steel an 'immigrant'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Meanwhile, opponents seek to close what they see as a loophole in federal trade law that lets foreign tobacco companies “game the system” by selling cigarettes in the U.S. essentially tax-free due to the refund mechanism.\n\nAs the Senate debated OBBB, Fairness for America widely pushed a 30-second political ad urging viewers to call Congress and “Fix the Double Drawback Loophole.”\n\n“This unfair loophole costs American taxpayers $12 billion over 10 years,” Fairness for America claimed, positioning the repeal effort as a Republican-led push in line with President Donald Trump’s crackdown on government waste, fraud, and abuse of American tax dollars.\n\nSince June 3, Fairness for America spent more than $1.3 million on ad buys concerning the tobacco tariff issue, including over $310,00 in North Carolina alone, according to AdImpact analytics. North Carolina is notably home to 800-plus tobacco farms and the headquarters for three major U.S. cigarette manufacturers.\n\nGoogle’s advertisement tracker shows Fairness for America ran the 30-second video as sponsored content on YouTube throughout June and again in early July. In June, the monthlong ad campaign was shown more than 3 million times and targeted the Washington, D.C market.\n\nAccording to domain data, Fairness for America’s website was registered on May 29 as part of the pop-up operation, and a bare-bones Facebook page for the group was set up on June 3.\n\nPoliticom Law co-founder Darrin Lim, a lobbyist and Democratic donor, is listed as the incorporator of Fairness for America, which was formed on May 8, incorporation records show.\n\nAccording to Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings, Lim has donated to numerous left-wing causes, including considerable contributions to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’ respective presidential runs.\n\nLim’s compliance consulting firm, Politicom Law, is a California-based “woman and minority owned boutique” helping Fortune 500 companies, trade associations, nonprofit organizations, and executives navigate lobbying regulations, campaign finance laws, and ethics rules.\n\nDespite the massive amount of cash spent on pushing this initiative, the repeal was ultimately removed from the final bill, thanks largely to counter-lobbying from OurAgFuture, a coalition of the North Carolina Chamber of Commerce.\n\nOurAgFuture aired multiple ads and video testimonies from North Carolina farmers and factory workers who would be affected by the repeal over the course of a six-figure media campaign to preserve the export incentive. “Exports are not only our future; they’re my current reality as a tobacco farmer,” said Brandon Batten, a sixth-generation farmer from North Carolina.\n\nGOP’S THOM TILLIS AND TED BUDD PRESSURED BY AGRICULTURE SECTOR OVER TRUMP’S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’\n\nBoth of North Carolina’s senators publicly backed the repeal’s removal after the Tar Heel State’s agricultural sector pressured them to oppose the provision. OurAgFuture, particularly, had called on Sens. Thom Tillis and Ted Budd (R-NC) to support safeguarding duty drawback.\n\nWithin days, on social media, Tillis took issue with the “hidden” tax hike “tucked away” in the mammoth budget reconciliation bill, noting its implications for farmers in North Carolina, the nation’s largest tobacco producer. In a separate X post, Budd said protecting duty drawback will keep North Carolina tobacco growers competitive with China.\n\nIn a statement shared with the Washington Examiner, OurAgFuture general counsel Ray Starling, formerly chief of staff to Tillis, thanked Congress “for standing up for North Carolina farmers and agricultural workers by preserving duty drawback.”\n\nNORTH CAROLINA REPUBLICANS PUSH TO REMOVE ‘HIDDEN TAX’ FROM ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ AFTER PRESSURE CAMPAIGN\n\n“This vital trade tool helps our producers stay competitive in global markets while supporting jobs here at home,” Starling said. “OurAgFuture will always fight to uphold this key provision as we continue to support President Trump’s pro-farmer and pro-worker agenda.”\n\nLast month, those wishing to withdraw duty drawback on tobacco goods got caught publishing a deceptive op-ed wrongly attributed to North Carolina corn farmer John Pickler, who afterward disavowed the since-deleted opinion piece. Appearing on NC Political News, a local politics website, the article in question championed the repeal.\n\nPickler, president of the state’s Corn Growers Association, then penned a letter to the North Carolina agricultural community explaining he had nothing to do with the op-ed.\n\n“I was so disappointed by the confusion created by NC Political News publishing an editorial under my name espousing opinions that neither I, nor the Corn Growers Association of North Carolina, endorse,” Pickler wrote. “The op-ed ‘Double Drawback Loophole Harms North Carolina Farmers, Time to Close It,’ in no way reflects my views or the views of the Corner Growers Association of North Carolina.”\n\nFollowing the failed ad push, still not much is known about Fairness for America or who exactly financed its multimillion-dollar endeavor.\n\nSome observers suspect that Fairness for America is funded by the American tobacco corporation Altria, which primarily manufactures and sells within the United States, so it does not benefit from duty drawback as much as its competitors.\n\nAs the Washington Post recently reported, “Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris USA and the firm pushing to end the tobacco tax treatment, has spent nearly $5 million lobbying Congress on this legislation and other issues through the first two quarters of 2025, according to federal disclosures.”\n\n“This dark money group spent $1 million attacking President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill and undercutting our farmers and workers, and they still lost,” a GOP strategist, speaking of Fairness for America, told the Washington Examiner. “They were warned by American farmers that this was the wrong position, but Altria kept lighting money on fire, fighting against American agriculture and President Trump.”\n\nThe strategist added that it will be “incredibly difficult for Altria to convince others to partner with them on another campaign to repeal duty drawback after the pure incompetence they displayed this time around.”\n\n“Trump is for the farmers and Altria spent millions to tank the OBBB and bankrupt farmers,” the Republican strategist said.\n\nAltria was contacted for comment on whether it is linked to Fairness for America.","summary":"A small tariff provision of the &#8220;One Big Beautiful Bill&#8221; spurred an expensive lobbying battle between special interests in the tobacco industry, including a full-court press from North Carolina&#8217;s export-dependent farming sector, where tobacco is a key cash crop.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JASON CHESTER FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:09:29 BST, 9 July 2025 |Updated:09:53 BST, 9 July 2025 \n\nTraffic wardens in leafy Wilmslow came very close to issuing a red card on Tuesday as former footballer Wayne Rooney parked his car in a disabled driver zone. \nThe retired Manchester United and England ace committed the parking equivalent of a sending off offence while out in suburban Cheshire. \nRooney, 39 - recently announced as a new Match Of The Day pundit - was seen pulling up outside a local barber shop in his Audi 4x4 before making his way inside. \nBut the luxury vehicle stood out for all the wrong reasons, with the ex-footballer parking in a space typically reserved for disabled drivers. \nThe distinctive disabled parking sign was within touching distance of Rooney's fender as he exited the vehicle and made his way across the car park.\nFortunately, the 120 cap former England international narrowly missed a parking ticket - not that he would have too much trouble paying it off after landing a lucrative new role with the BBC. \n\nTraffic wardens in leafy Wilmslow came very close to issuing a red card on Tuesday as former footballer Wayne Rooney parked his car in a disabled driver zone\n\nThe retired Manchester United and England ace committed the parking equivalent of a sending off offence while out in suburban Cheshire\n\nThe distinctive disabled parking sign was within touching distance of Rooney's fender\nIn Wilmslow, illegally parking in a disabled bay without a valid Blue Badge, will likely result in a fine of £70, with the charge rising to £105 if left unpaid for longer than 28 days. \nBut it's a drop in the ocean for Rooney, who lives in a sprawling Cheshire mansion with wife Coleen and their four children and will earn a reported £800,000 over two years as a Match Of The Day pundit.\nThe former footballer has been out of management since leaving Plymouth Argyle by mutual consent on New Year’s Eve following a challenging seven-month spell in charge. \nIt was his fourth managerial role in as many years, after equally unsuccessful stints with Derby County, DC United and Birmingham City.\nRooney has made no secret of his enjoyment of punditry since stepping back from coaching, appearing on Amazon Prime Video for Champions League coverage and joining the BBC as a guest on Match of the Day.\nSpeaking to talkSPORT in June, he appeared to hint that his immediate future would involve more media work than management.\nHe told the radio station: ‘Obviously just doing some TV work at the minute, so that’s what I’m doing. I’m enjoying it. So, that’s where I’ll be.’\nAccording to The Sun, Rooney will earn £800,000 over two years with the BBC and is set to be unveiled later this month after impressing during his guest appearances.\n\nThe former Manchester United and England striker's Audi 4x4 stood out for all the wrong reasons during his latest appearance in Cheshire \n\nRooney will reportedly earn £800,000 over two years with the BBC and is set to be unveiled later this month after impressing during his guest appearances\n\nRooney committed the parking equivalent of a sending off offence while out in suburban Cheshire\n\n Wayne Rooney 'lands £800,000 BBC deal to be Match of the Day regular' \nThe deal reportedly also includes a role in the broadcaster’s coverage of the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada, plus the option of a further two-year extension.\nRooney’s imminent arrival comes as Match of the Day moves into a new era following Gary Lineker’s departure, with the BBC looking to refresh its punditry team alongside presenters Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan.\nInsiders are said to have described Rooney as ‘warm, witty and forensically knowledgeable’, with his insight seen as a valuable addition as the show adapts in the streaming age.\nRooney's move also comes as wife Coleen continues to expand her own media profile, having reportedly signed a £10million deal with Disney for a family documentary featuring the couple and their four sons.\nMailOnline has contacted a representative for further comment. \n\nInsiders are said to have described Rooney as ‘warm, witty and forensically knowledgeable’, with his insight seen as a valuable addition as Match Of The Day adapts in the streaming age\nWayne RooneyMatch DayBBC\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nWayne Rooney almost falls foul of Cheshire traffic wardens after leaving his Audi 4x4 in a disabled parking zone - as ex footballer 'prepares for £400,000 a year Match Of The Day role'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 14\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email arthur.parashar@mailonline.co.uk \nBy ARTHUR PARASHAR\n Published:09:22 BST, 9 July 2025 |Updated:09:25 BST, 9 July 2025 \n\nA 'noise sensitive' woman who took her sisters to court in a bid to keep their late mother's home for herself has been warned she has likely blown her entire £100,000-plus inheritance on a 'wasteful' legal fight.\nSharon Duggan, 49, was left a third of the share of her mother's £420,000 home, but dramatically sparked a bitter inheritance battle after claiming she needed the house for her and her two emotional support dogs. \nThe 'hyper-vigilant' and sound sensitive' woman sued her sisters, Ann and Brenda Duggan, claiming she needed their mother's house because she could not bear living in a noisy flat.\nHowever, her case was kicked out at Central London County Court last month - and she now faces having to pay all of the lawyers' bills for the 'extremely wasteful and expensive' dispute.\nOrdering her to stump up for the costs - yet to be calculated exactly - Judge Alan Johns KC said the 'grim reality' was that it would be 'highly likely' to wipe out the share of her mother's estate she is rightfully due.\n'This marks a sad end to a sad case,' he said. 'It is likely that Sharon will be left with nothing of the £100,000 or more that otherwise would have been her inheritance.\n'That is the heavy price to be paid by her for pursuing this litigation to trial.'\nThe court heard how Agnes Duggan left her house, thought to be worth about £420,000, to be split equally between her three daughters, former NHS worker Sharon, alternative therapist Brenda, 55, and oldest sister Ann, 60.\n\nSharon Duggan (pictured) took her sisters to court after their mother Agnes died in 2018 to block them from the inheritance\n\nThe court heard most of the estate was tied up in the Crawley property, where Sharon said she had cared for Agnes during her final years with dementia\nBut Sharon - who said she 'is dyslexic and suffers from a variety of health issues, including chronic fatigue syndrome, migraine, fibromyalgia, depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD, and Adjustment Disorder (and) also has long Covid' - claimed the house for herself and her therapeutic rescue dogs.\nShe sued her sisters under the 1975 Inheritance Act, claiming 'reasonable provision' above her one-third share of her mother's fortune. \nShe claimed her special sensitivity and medical ailments mean she should get at least a life interest in the property in Lyndhurst Close, Crawley.\nShe insisted that her needs outweighed her sisters' right to get the inheritance they are due, also arguing that it would be hard to find alternative accommodation for both her and her two dogs, which 'help with her mental and emotional well-being'.\nSharon claimed she 'sacrificed' her career to move in and help out her mother in 2014, also claiming her mother was planning to change her will to ensure the house was left to her.\nAs well as helping her mother out with her daily needs, she claimed to have spent £30,000 of her own money on funding Agnes' hefty vet bills for her beloved Jack Russell/Chihuahua cross, Lady.\nIn her written arguments to the court, Sharon insisted that 'psychologically she could not cope with living in a flat again,' adding: 'She is anxious that neighbours may cause disturbances and impact upon her ability to sleep.\n'She now has two rescue dogs, which help with her mental and emotional well-being, but which makes finding suitable alternative accommodation difficult.'\n\nBrenda Duggan, seen outside Central London County Court, fought the case, insisting Sharon and her pets will be fine in a flat\n\n Woman who told her sisters she needed mum's home for emotional support dogs loses inheritance row \nIn the witness box, she insisted that downsizing to a flat would be too much for her, telling the court: 'I have two dogs to consider and I am hyper-vigilant and sound-sensitive.'\nShe argued she should be allowed to buy out her sisters for a small sum to be raised by a mortgage or alternatively the right to stay there for life.\nAlthough Ann remained neutral in the dispute, Brenda - who formerly ran a bioresonance therapy company and a business providing gluten-free altar bread to food-intolerant Catholics - fought the case, insisting Sharon and her pets will be fine in a flat.\nGiving judgment last month, Judge Johns accepted that Sharon has 'particular issues,' but ultimately ruled that a flat could not be ruled out as 'suitable' accommodation for her.\nRuling against Sharon, Judge Johns said: 'It's my judgment that there has been no failure to make reasonable financial provision for her.\n'I am not satisfied there was any promise that the property would be Sharon's - and certainly not a promise that Sharon was confident would be carried out.\n'This is a modest estate and Agnes had two other daughters to think of. Essentially, provision was made for Sharon by giving her one third of the estate.'\n\nAnn Duggan, seen outside Central London County Court, remained neutral in the dispute\nThe decision left all three sisters due to inherit assets worth about £100,000 from their mother after estate costs, but Judge Johns last week said Sharon's share would almost definitely now be wiped out.\nReturning to court to decide who should pay the costs of the trial, lawyers for Brenda and for their mother's estate argued that neither should be left out of pocket when it was Sharon who brought the case.\nBrenda's barrister, Alex Findlay, told the judge that offers had been made to Sharon pre-trial which would have seen her receive extra money, but she had refused.\n'This has been extremely wasteful and expensive litigation, to say nothing of the stress,' he said.\nGiving judgment, Judge Johns said: 'It is submitted that Sharon should not be allowed to walk away without any costs order being made - I agree.'\nHe ordered that she pay the lawyers' bills of both Brenda and their mother's estate, with the sums to be assessed at a later date, but estimated at over the £100,000-plus she is due to inherit.\n'The grim reality of this litigation is likely to be that all of Sharon's share will be burned up by the costs, so she will end up with nothing,' he said.\nSharon was not in court for the costs hearing.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \n'Noise sensitive' woman blows her entire £100,000 inheritance in 'sad, wasteful and expensive' court fight with her sisters over their mother's £420,000 home\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

I didn’t realize how friendly it looked. I saw it on your wonderful network just a little while ago before I came in and I said, “Boy, they look like two people that like each other,”‘ he later told reporters.\n\nTheir on-camera bromance on January 9 was a far cry from how their relationship started, with Trump repeatedly accusing Obama of not being born in the US.\n\nTheir friendly banter at Carter’s funeral was also in stark contrast to how they appeared together at the funeral of former President George H.W. Bush in December 2018. \n\nThen, they did not sit next to one another, with Trump’s wife Melania in the middle of them.\n\nForensic lip reader Jeremy Freeman told Daily Mail in January that the most recent conversation between Trump and Obama was apparently centered around the two of them finding time and a private space to talk.\n\nTrump suggested they look for a ‘quiet place’ where they could discuss the unknown matter after the service at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe last known private conversation between the two men came shortly after Trump was first elected president in 2016.\n\nSome of that chat at the White House has since come to light, including Obama telling Trump of his deep concerns over North Korea.\n\nAt the time, Obama said Pyongyang and its nuclear and missile programs represented the greatest threat to the United States as Trump embarked on his first term.\n\nThe latest conversation between Trump and Obama to date came during the funeral for Carter, the 39th president who died on December 29, 2024, at age 100.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who was the first sitting senator to endorse Carter’s 1976 run for the White House, delivered a eulogy.\n\nTrump had Obama seated to his right, and wife Melania was to his left. Michelle Obama was not at the funeral.\n\nAt one point, Kamala Harris, seated in the row in front of Obama and Trump, turned back to look at their conversation, then turned around and let out a long sigh.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDuring Jimmy Carter&#8217;s funeral back in January, Donald Trump extended an invitation&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump&#8217;s Remarks to Obama at Jimmy Carter&#8217;s Funeral first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/trumps-remarks-to-obama-at-jimmy-carters-funeral/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/What-Trump-said-to-Obama-during-Jimmy-Carters-funeral.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-09 06:16:26","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.124},{"id":339742050,"title":"Honeymoon crashers!

Now Lauren Sanchez parties in Paris with Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and model Brooks Nader\n\nHave YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy CARLY JOHNSON and JANE HERZ FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:06:24 BST, 9 July 2025 |Updated:06:59 BST, 9 July 2025 \n\nNewlywed Lauren Sanchez looked sensational as she enjoyed a night out in Paris, France with some of her A-list friends, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Sean Penn, on Tuesday.\nIt marks Sanchez's first public outing since she and Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos, 61, tied the knot during their lavish $50million Italian wedding weekend last month.\nSanchez and Bezos hosted 200 elite guests during the controversial three-day extravaganza — which many dubbed the 'Wedding of the Century.'\nThe celebration continued this past weekend as the couple spent their 'honeymoon' partying on a yacht with recently split couple, Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom, in Capri.\nAnd on Tuesday night, a solo Sanchez ventured to Paris without her billionaire husband where she met up with Oscar-winners DiCaprio, Penn and model Brooks Nader and more stars for an upscale dinner at Laperouse restaurant.\nThe new Mrs. Bezos, 55, made jaws drop upon arrival as she flashed her ample cleavage in a red latex dress by Versace, which retails for over $3,500.\nShe finished off the look with her hair sleek and straight, and carried a black crocodile Hermès Kelly bag, which typically has a resale value of over $50,000.\n\nNewlywed Lauren Sanchez looked sensational as she

Bezos, 61, tied the knot during their lavish $20million Italian wedding weekend last month\n\nSanchez was without her billionaire husband as she met up with her pals Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and model Brooks Nader for dinner at Laperouse restaurant\nSanchez was photographed exiting Laperouse, which is situated along the Seine and boasts private dining rooms, with a crew of security guards surrounding her.\nShe smiled while being escorted to a nearby SUV as locals and paparazzi looked on in awe.\n\n Leonardo DiCaprio makes low-profile appearance at Lauren Sanchez's Paris dinner party \nSanchez's model pal Nader put on an X-rated display for their night out in Paris by going braless under a black see-through pussy bow blouse.\nThe shocking top left nothing to the imagination as Nader, 28, confidently exited Laperouse with a security guard in tow.\nThe blonde bombshell completed her racy outfit with skintight capri pants, sky-high heels and a shiny black clutch.\nAs for her glam, Nader's plump pout was drenched in lip gloss and her long hair looked extra voluminous for the invite-only occasion amid Paris Fashion Week.\nNader's younger sister Sarah Jane Nader was also in attendance.\nThe brunette beauty was pictured walking behind her model sister in a daringly low-cut top. \nDiCaprio — who was recently branded a 'hypocrite' for associating with Bezos — tried to keep a low-profile as he left the restaurant before Sanchez and Nader.\nDressed in a casual all-black outfit, the 50-year-old famous face was barely visible behind an N95 and a black baseball cap, which he pulled down to cover his eyes.\n\nThe new Mrs. Bezos, 55, made jaws drop upon arrival \n\nShe flashed her cleavage in a skintight red latex dress by Versace, which retails for over $3,500\n\nShe finished off the look with her hair sleek and straight\n\nSanchez was photographed exiting Laperouse, which is situated along the Seine and boasts private dining rooms, with a crew of security guards surrounding her\nThe look resembled viral photos from the Bezos-Sanchez wedding that showed a tuxedo-clad DiCaprio seemingly trying to 'hide' from cameras by wearing a hat low down over his eyes and nose.\nMissing from DiCaprio's side on Tuesday night was his supermodel girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti, 27.\nInstead, DiCaprio was joined by a single bodyguard as he made a beeline to a nearby chauffeured car parked outside of Laperouse.\nPenn, 64, rolled up the A-list gathering with his stunning 30-year-old girlfriend, Valeria Nicov. \nThe Mystic River star looked slimmer than ever in a trendy neutral-toned outfit as Nicov, wearing a white blouse and black slacks, trailed behind him.\nThe couple, who made their red carpet debut last December, were photographed walking into the restaurant separately. \nSocialite Natasha Poonawalla was also on hand for Sanchez's star-studded dinner in Paris. \nBezos' absence from the dinner party was likely due to a scheduling conflict as he is expected to attend Allen & Co.'s annual leadership retreat in Sun Valley, Idaho this week.\nDays before Sanchez's Paris trip, the journalist and Bezos were spotted partying on a superyacht in the Mediterranean during what many believed was their honeymoon.\n\nSanchez's model pal Brooks Nader put on an X-rated display for their night out in Paris by going braless under a black see-through pussy bow blouse\n\nThe shocking top left nothing to the imagination as Nader, 28, confidently exited Laperouse restaurant with a security guard in tow\n\nDiCaprio — who was recently branded a 'hypocrite' for associating with Bezos — tried to keep a low-profile as he left the restaurant before Sanchez and Nader\n\nDressed in a casual all-black outfit, the 50-year-old famous face was barely visible behind an N95 and a black baseball cap, which he pulled down to cover his eyes\n\nPenn, 64, rolled up the A-list gathering with his stunning 30-year-old girlfriend, Valeria Nicov \n\nNicov stunned in a white blouse and black slacks as she trailed behind her much-older beau \n\nBrooks Nader's younger sister Sarah Jane Nader was also in attendance\n\nThe brunette beauty was pictured wearing a daringly low-cut dress as she exited a vehicle with Sanchez\n\nBlack Eyed Peas member APL.DE.AP posed out front of Laperouse after attending the exclusive dinner party \n\nSocialite Natasha Poonawalla was also on hand for Sanchez's star-studded dinner party\nBut instead of spending one-on-one time, the couple were joined on the boat trip by Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom — who recently confirmed their breakup — and several other friends as they soaked up the sun over the weekend.\nHowever, DailyMail.com recently learned that the trip was technically not an official honeymoon for Bezos and Sanchez, who appeared to be enjoying their extended vacation following their Venice nuptials.\nThe luxe event, which not only featured their actual wedding but multiple themed parties and brunches, saw the couple surrounded by 200 friends and family.\nAccording to The Guardian, over 90 jets flew into the airport in the romantic city.\nA-listers like Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, Oprah Winfrey and Kris Jenner all made an appearance, as well as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.\nEllie Goulding performed at their reception, while Usher also sang at their pajama-themed brunch the next day.\nThe A-list wedding was met with fierce backlash by locals who gathered in St Mark's Square, the iconic heart of Venice, to protest during the three-day event. \nThere were criticisms regarding over-tourism, how much Bezos pays in taxes and his environmental impact.\nHowever there was no mention of the criticism as Sanchez shared details of her wedding with Vogue.\nThe happy couple got married in a restored amphitheater on the island, as Sánchez wore a high-neck, long sleeve lace Dolce & Gabbana gown that took over 900 hours of atelier to make.\n\nSanchez's Parisian dinner marked her first public outing since she and Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos, 61, tied the knot during their lavish $50million Italian wedding weekend last month\n\nSanchez and Bezos hosted 200 elite guests during the controversial three-day extravaganza — which many dubbed the 'Wedding of the Century'; the couple pictured on June 28 in Venice\nThe gown featured a flared skirt, long veil, and a tight-fitting waist, with tons of buttons going up the middle.\n'Very Lauren. Sexy, happy, not too serious, not too drama. Elegant but at the same time sensual,' Domenico Dolce told the outlet about the bride's dress.\nBut the dress wasn't the only star of the show. The Blue Origin astronaut had many looks for the different occasions, including a pajama-themed party on their last night.\nSanchez chose a strapless, dusty pink bustier Atelier Versace gown for the event, with bejeweled detailing all over the body - but it was her secret accessory that really stood out.\nThroughout the weekend, Lauren also wore many custom accessories that were a nod to her new last name, like a black rhinestone-encrusted black clutch bag that read, 'Mrs. Bezos' on it in silver gems.\nOn the morning of her wedding, Sanchez stepped out in a cream, two-piece skirt suit by Dior, adding a personal touch as she wore a brown braided bracelet with diamond charms that read 'LB,' in honor of becoming Lauren Bezos.\nBut Sanchez told Vogue that the wedding wasn't about the dresses or accessories, it was about finally marrying Bezos, who she described as the love of her life.\n'I'm very happy,' she told the outlet.\n'More than the dress, I'm happy that I'm getting married and I get to spend my life with my best friend, someone who sees me, someone who adores me, someone who I adore. I am the luckiest woman on the planet,' she shared.\nDays before they walked down the aisle, a source closely connected to the wedding revealed to DailyMail.com exclusively that the couple were already married.\n\nSanchez's dinner party guests Brooks Nader and Leonardo DiCaprio both attended her and Bezos' June wedding\n\nKim Kardashian as well as her sisters Khloe, Kylie, Kendall and mom Kris Jenner supported pal Lauren during the three-day celebration; Kim pictured on June 27 in Venice\n\nPresident Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner were also in attendance; the couple pictured in Venice on June 28\n'They have been married for at least a month, more than a month. The marriage is fully legal and took place in America under American law,' the insider shared.\nThey added: 'When they were planning the wedding, they were clear about the fact that they were already secretly married. There is no application for a wedding license from the couple because it was not required.\n'Whatever happens at the wedding on Friday, it will not be a wedding. Under Italian law, it will not be a wedding celebration, any vows said or rings exchanged will have no legal meaning.'\nThe source also claimed that Bezos had personally confirmed that he and Sanchez were already legally married, and that they had also signed a pre-nuptial agreement to protect his incredible $244 billion fortune.\nBrooks NaderJeff BezosOrlando BloomParis\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHoneymoon crashers!

I didn’t realize how friendly it looked. I saw it on your wonderful network just a little while ago before I came in and I said, \"Boy, they look like two people that like each other,\"' he later told reporters.\n\nTheir on-camera bromance on January 9 was a far cry from how their relationship started, with Trump repeatedly accusing Obama of not being born in the US.\n\nTheir friendly banter at Carter's funeral was also in stark contrast to how they appeared together at the funeral of former President George H.W. Bush in December 2018. \n\nThen, they did not sit next to one another, with Trump's wife Melania in the middle of them.\n\nForensic lip reader Jeremy Freeman told Daily Mail in January that the most recent conversation between Trump and Obama was apparently centered around the two of them finding time and a private space to talk.\n\nTrump suggested they look for a 'quiet place' where they could discuss the unknown matter after the service at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe last known private conversation between the two men came shortly after Trump was first elected president in 2016.\n\nSome of that chat at the White House has since come to light, including Obama telling Trump of his deep concerns over North Korea.\n\nAt the time, Obama said Pyongyang and its nuclear and missile programs represented the greatest threat to the United States as Trump embarked on his first term.\n\nThe latest conversation between Trump and Obama to date came during the funeral for Carter, the 39th president who died on December 29, 2024, at age 100.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who was the first sitting senator to endorse Carter's 1976 run for the White House, delivered a eulogy.\n\nTrump had Obama seated to his right, and wife Melania was to his left. Michelle Obama was not at the funeral.\n\nAt one point, Kamala Harris, seated in the row in front of Obama and Trump, turned back to look at their conversation, then turned around and let out a long sigh.","summary":"A new book has revealed precisely what President Donald Trump told former President Barack Obama during their spirited conversation at Jimmy Carter's funeral in January.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14888113/Donald-Trump-Barack-Obama-moment-Jimmy-Carter-funeral.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/09/05/100135579-0-image-m-11_1752036259029.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/01/10/5247133408859044558/1024x576_MP4_5247133408859044558.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-09 05:46:20","author":"Editor,James Cirrone","authors":["Editor","James Cirrone"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.114},{"id":339713392,"title":"Kennedy grandson Jack Schlossberg mocks grandma Jacqueline Onassis’ pain over former prez’s alleged affair in unhinged post","text":"Jack Schlossberg, a Kennedy heir known for making wild public statements on social media, fired off at his late grandmother Jaqueline Kennedy Onassis in an offbeat Instagram post about her troubled personal life on Monday.\n\nSchlossberg took a video of a People magazine cover from July 7 featuring his grandmother standing behind his grandfather, John F. Kennedy, with the headline “Jackie Knew Everything.”\n\nThe 32-year-old Kennedy scion captioned the post, “Jackie was right about everything,” alluding to the former first lady knowing about her husband’s alleged affair with pop culture icon Marilyn Monroe.\n\nJackie allegedly knew about JFK’s long-rumored relationship with Monroe and confronted him about it while he was in office, according to People.\n\nJ. Randy Taraborrelli — the author of a new biography on the 35th president, “JFK: Public, Private, Secret” — alleges that Jackie once told Kennedy, “This one’s different, Jack. This one worries me.”\n\n“That’s from somebody who was right there in the White House who overheard that conversation,” Taraborrelli told the outlet. “It was reported to me 25 years ago, when I was writing an earlier book, Jackie, Ethel and Joan.”\n\nWhile the affair between the sex symbol and former president has been long-rumored, Taraborrelli claimed Jackie “didn’t know if JFK was involved with her or not. She just assumed it. What I do know is after Marilyn died, Jackie was bereft.”\n\nSchlossberg is the only grandson of Jackie, who died of cancer in 1994 at age 64, and JFK, who was assassinated in 1963 at 43.\n\nJackie Kennedy, who took the name Onassis after marrying Greek business magnate Aristotle Onassis in 1968, was considered one of the most stylish and distinguished first ladies ever, and during her time, was a media magnet — with newspapers, magazines, and TV obsessively trying to cover every aspect of her life.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Schlossberg has made a bizarre comment about his grandmother.\n\nFollowing the 2025 inauguration, the Harvard grad questioned whether Vice President JD Vance’s wife, Usha Vance, was “hotter” than his grandmother.\n\n“True or false: Usha Vance is way hotter than Jackie O?” he asked his followers on X back in January.\n\nAfter being slammed for his bizarre question, Schlossberg admitted he was a “literal pervert” in a follow-up post.\n\n“I called my grandmother hot … have I totally lost it? Jesus … this kid will do anything for attention. Your grandfather would be ashamed. Seriously. Time to get a job,” he wrote.\n\nSchlossberg left many of his followers concerned, with some even telling the 32-year-old to “seek help.”\n\nSchlossberg is the son of former diplomat and author Caroline Kennedy and designer Edwin Schlossberg, who have been married since 1986.\n\nSimilar to his late grandfather, Schlossberg has held progressive and left-leaning political views.\n\nLast July, he was appointed Vogue’s political correspondent to cover the 2024 presidential election between former President Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nHe previously endorsed Harris and former President Joe Biden.","summary":"Jack Schlossberg, a Kennedy heir known for making wild public statements on social media, fired off at his late grandmother Jaqueline Kennedy Onassis in an offbeat Instagram post about her troubled personal life on Monday.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/09/us-news/kennedy-grandson-jack-schlossberg-mocks-grandma-jacqueline-onassis-pain-over-jfks-alleged-affair-in-unhinged-post/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/kennedy-comp.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Xlvrk7Yf-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-09 05:36:08","author":"Richard Pollina","authors":["Richard Pollina"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.095},{"id":339681056,"title":"Gavin Newsom's Reaction as Top Democrat Hints at Governor's 2028 Run","text":"U.S. Representative James Clyburn, an influential South Carolina Democrat, seemingly introduced Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom at an event Tuesday by saying in part, \"welcoming these candidates who are running for president.\"According to reporters in the room, Newsom, 57, grinned and jokingly turned around to take a look behind himself.Newsweek reached out to Newsom's office via email for comment.Why It MattersThe moment, captured by reporters and shared across social media, fuels already heightened speculation about Newsom's intentions for the 2028 presidential race.Clyburn was pivotal in former President Joe Biden's path to the 2020 Democratic nomination—his endorsement ahead of the South Carolina primary is widely credited with reviving Biden's campaign and helping him secure the presidency.As the Democratic Party grapples with the fallout of the 2024 election loss, leaders have struggled to get behind a unified message as calls for primarying establishment candidates have rung from within.What To KnowOn the first day of Newsom's two-day tour of rural counties in the Palmetto State, Clyburn introduced him in Camden—while noting the importance of electing Democrats across the ballot—saying, \"as we go around, welcoming these candidates who are running for president,\" prompting Newsom to sport a \"sheepish grin\" and look behind himself, according to reporters including Joseph Bustos of The State Newspaper.Politico reporter Tyler Katzenberger posted about the moment on X, formerly Twitter, questioning if the moment was a \"Freudian slip?\"Katzenberger also reported that the California governor has \"sidestepped questions\" on the topic amid his time in South Carolina.At the event, Newsom ripped the recently passed and signed into law \"big, beautiful bill\" touted by President Donald Trump.He also spoke on civil rights and disaster aid, according to State Newspaper reporter Lucy Valeski on X, who also reported that the governor said he is squarely focused on building up the party as the midterm elections approach.\"What we're experiencing is America in reverse,\" Newsom told the crowd, per ABC News. \"They're trying to bring us back to a pre-1960s world on voting rights—you know it well. Civil rights, LGBTQ rights, women's rights and not just access to abortion, but also access to simple reproductive care, contraception ... It's a moment that few of us could have imagined.\"Early polls testing the waters of the Democratic Party ahead of the 2028 race show several figures, including Newsom, as potential leaders for the party's future direction.An Emerson poll released in June found that former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was leading the pack of potential hopefuls, surging past former Vice President Kamala Harris. Newsom followed in third place in the survey.Newsom oversaw the state response to the deadly wildfires in January that inundated Southern California, destroying thousands of structures and prompting evacuations for thousands of people.In June, protests and riots took over portions of downtown Los Angeles in reaction to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids throughout the city. The governor has since been embroiled in public feuds on social media with the Trump administration regarding numerous policies.What People Are SayingNewsom posted to X on Tuesday: \"Millions without healthcare and food assistance. Trillions added to the national debt. All to fund tax cuts for billionaires that weren't even asking for them. Donald Trump's bill is a betrayal to the American people.\"California Republican Party, on X: \"While @GavinNewsom is in South Carolina today, maybe he should ask its @GOP governor, @HenryMcMaster why South Carolina's gas prices are less than half as much as they are here. Gavin could learn something to benefit Californians rather than lecturing Americans 3,000 miles away.\"Political science professor at Columbia University, Robert Y. Shapiro, to Newsweek via email Tuesday: \"Three things: It looks like Newsom would like to enter the presidential race. He has been getting visibility in taking on Trump and taking his shot on the homelessness issue where he could be vulnerable. And he is with Clyburn who has been a kingmaker, so to speak.\"\"Second, Clyburn is likely to be going around with other potential candidates and he wants to give candidates visibility so voters can start seeing who the good ones are,\" Shapiro said. \"Third, he will not endorse anyone early. He will want to see how they stand up on their own and he will weigh in later in the primary season when he can see who is a good candidate and a very viable candidate, and when his endorsement can count most.\"What Happens NextThe Democratic field for 2028 is expected to remain fluid until after the midterm cycle, when a clearer picture of national priorities, party unity and key endorsements—including from influential figures like Clyburn—emerge. The party's efforts to clarify its message and leadership will likely intensify as primary season nears.","summary":"The Democratic field for 2028 is expected to remain fluid until after the next midterm cycle.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/gavin-newsoms-reaction-top-democrat-hints-governors-2028-run-2096407","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2679353/gavin-newsom.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-09 03:18:03","author":"Anna Commander","authors":["Anna Commander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.056}]}
