Josh Shapiro, D-Pa., said during an interview with CBS' Norah O'Donnell on Sunday that former Vice President Kamala Harris' vetting team wasn't respectful with regard to his wife, in addition to the other questions he felt were offensive. \"You say in the book that you were advised, well, your wife’s going to have to get new clothes. She’s going to have to pay for hair and makeup. You’re going to have to move into the vice presidential, all this stuff. And it seemed like it kind of turned you off,\" O'Donnell said. O'Donnell spoke to Shapiro about his new book, \"Where We Keep the Light,\" which is set to be released Tuesday. In the book, Shapiro details the vetting process he went through with Harris. \"Look, there were a number of moments in that process where I was asked things or, in the case of what you just said, I thought folks weren’t particularly respectful to my wife, that left me really questioning whether this was something I wanted to do,\" Shapiro responded. TEVI TROY: SHAPIRO'S REVENGE ONCE AGAIN REVEALS KAMALA HARRIS' INCOMPETENCE O'Donnell pressed Shapiro about the process and said that he had written in the book that he felt the vetting process was unnecessarily contentious. \"I write both in the book about the vetting process and about the best way I could serve. As it relates to the vetting process, I thought some of the commentary about my wife was not okay. And I thought asking me if I was a double agent for the Israeli government, was offensive,\" he said. He wrote in the book that he was asked by former Biden aide Dana Remus if had ever been an \"agent of the Israeli government\" and \"I understand they had a job to do to ask me those questions. I think it went beyond just checking a box on a questionnaire,\" he told O'Donnell. RACHEL MADDOW REGRETS NOT PRESSING KAMALA HARRIS MORE DURING INTERVIEW ABOUT '107 DAYS' MEMOIR O'Donnell also asked him why he thought he was being asked that question, to which he said he didn't know. \"I don’t want to sit here and ascribe beliefs to others. I can tell you that it landed on me in an offensive way. I have dedicated my entire adult life to serving this country, serving this country in different elected capacities, different volunteer capacities. I love this country. And for someone to question that, for someone to question my loyalty, particularly as someone who is as open about his faith as he is, was offensive to me,\" he said. Shapiro said he understood that the people questioning him were just doing their job.

He also said he didn't know if Harris knew if he was asked these questions, particularly about being an agent for Israel.

Is it “law and order” to prosecute your political enemies?

Trump then canceled Joe Biden in the presidential debate in 2024, and then Trump beat Kamala Harris for president .

Their inability to cope with losing the election is embarrassing and pathetic.\n\nThey need to grow up and deal with it. Trump has three more years .

Never has a generation inherited more and done less with it.”\n\nAmy Nixon, a housing and economic analyst, vented, “Stop doing nonsensical things.”\n\n“What percentage of ‘seniors’ (I’ll assume 65+ given your use of that word) are either working or still raising families?

'The killing of Alex Pretti is a heartbreaking tragedy,' Obama said in a statement posted to X on Sunday. 'It should also be a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault.'The intervention marks one of Obama's most direct criticisms of his successor since Trump began his second term, breaking with the former president's longstanding reluctance to comment on current political affairs. Obama has faced pressure from Democrats and activists to speak out more forcefully against the Trump administration's policies.Rare Presidential Rebuke'People across the country have been rightly outraged by the spectacle of masked ICE recruits and other federal agents acting with impunity and engaging in tactics that seem designed to intimidate, harass, and provoke and endanger the residents of a major American city,' Obama wrote in his statement. The former president's statement came one day after Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse at a Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital, was shot dead by Border Patrol agents on a Minneapolis street.According to federal officials, Pretti was allegedly carrying a loaded firearm when he positioned himself between agents and a woman they were pepper-spraying during protests against Operation Metro Surge. Agents attempted to arrest Pretti and pulled a gun from his belt before firing approximately 10 shots at him. Video footage verified by multiple news outlets shows Pretti holding a mobile phone in his right hand with his left hand raised as federal agents confronted him.Trump Administration Accused of Escalating CrisisObama went further than simply condemning the shooting, directly accusing the Trump administration of deliberately inflaming tensions in Minnesota. 'The President and current administration officials seem eager to escalate the situation, while offering public explanation for the shootings of Mr Pretti and Renee Good that aren't informed by any serious investigation—and that appear to be directly contradicted by video evidence,' Obama wrote.The reference to Renee Good acknowledges the 7 January fatal shooting of the 37-year-old American citizen by ICE agent Jonathan Ross. Good appeared to be blocking immigration officers with her car when she drove forward, prompting an agent to open fire and kill her. That incident sparked the initial wave of protests that have continued for weeks. While conceding that immigration agents have a 'tough job', Obama made clear he believes the Trump administration is encouraging lawless behaviour amongst federal agents rather than promoting de-escalation and proper investigation procedures.Pattern of Selective Public StatementsObama's statement on Sunday represents a continuation of his gradual increase in public criticism of the Trump administration throughout 2025. The former president has 'stepped up his criticisms' in recent months after private conversations with allies about whether he should speak out more frequently. In June 2025, Obama warned that the United States was 'dangerously close' to normalising behaviour 'consistent with autocracies', offering thinly veiled criticism of Trump during a Connecticut event.However, Obama has faced criticism from within his own party for what some view as excessive caution in confronting Trump's policies. A June article in The Atlantic questioned 'Where is Barack Obama?' and criticised the former president for opting for 'minimal communication' despite being 'the most effective communicator in the Democratic Party'.Political Impact and White House ResponseObama's intervention comes at a moment when Democrats lack clear national leadership and are struggling to mount an effective response to Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement policies. Obama remains highly popular with voters, with polling showing him enjoying a net 17 per cent favourability rating compared to Trump's minus-15 per cent. The former president's statement may embolden other Democratic leaders to speak out more forcefully against federal operations in Minnesota.Governor Tim Walz has characterised the situation as a 'federal occupation' and called the ICE deployment 'a campaign of organised brutality', while Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has filed for a temporary restraining order to halt Operation Metro Surge entirely. Former Vice President Kamala Harris and numerous Democratic lawmakers have also condemned the shootings, with Harris saying she was 'enraged and heartbroken' over Pretti's death.The White House has not yet issued a formal response to Obama's statement. However, in previous instances when Obama has criticised the administration, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson has characterised the former president as 'the architect of modern political division in America'. Trump himself has frequently attacked Obama on social media, at one point accusing his predecessor of 'treason'—claims that prompted a rare rebuke from Obama's office calling the allegations 'outrageous' and 'bizarre'.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/barack-obama-breaks-silence-minneapolis-shooting-says-trump-tactics-designed-intimidate-1773613","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1785852/barrack-mn.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=afd320b2915bfccdf5c350bece623fac","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 20:49:57","author":"Bernadette B.

His colleagues described the 30-year-old as a brave person doing dangerous work. He was married just two weeks ago.”\n\nIt’s a blink-and-you-miss-it sleight of hand that tells you exactly where the priorities of the news regime at CBS lie. First, there’s the tone, which exudes calmness about the fact that a co-worker has been killed doing his job. Dokoupil states that Shaat died in an Israeli airstrike targeting “a group operating a drone affiliated with Hamas,” the implication being that Shaat was either working with Hamas or was a little too cozy with Hamas, a means of justifying his killing. Finally, Dokoupil uses the distancing language of “[Shaat’s] colleagues” – making clear that the host of “CBS Evening News” is certainly not among them.\n\nIt was just the latest low for a host who has struggled to find his footing and his audience. Dokoupil’s viewership numbers have been in the tank, with the number of eyeballs down 23 percent in his first five days on air, compared to a year ago with anchor Norah O’Donnell. Viewership was not much improved in Dokoupil’s second week; “CBS Evening News” remained a distant third behind ABC and NBC’s evening news shows. (Perhaps that’s why Dylan Byers, every media boss’s favorite stenographer, landed the unattributed scoop Thursday night that “Evening News” drew 6.4 million viewers on Monday, said to be its largest audience since 2021.) Dokoupil’s first official broadcast was marred by gaffes, and his January 6 show featured a fawning package on Secretary of State Marco Rubio that featured the utterly surreal lines: “Marco Rubio, we salute you. You’re the ultimate Florida Man.” (The White House rapid response team approvingly shared the clip.)\n\nHigher up at the network, there have been multiple rounds of reporting that Weiss, CBS’s new editor-in-chief, isn’t so much a manager or a journalist as the person tasked with courting the capricious approval of President Donald Trump. Weiss, who answers directly to David Ellison, infamously caused a Streisand effect by pulling a “60 Minutes” story about Venezuelan men deported to a notoriously violent prison in El Salvador hours before it was set to air because there was no on-camera comment from the Trump administration. The story finally aired Sunday with no substantive changes — and without the all-important on-air administration voice. \n\nComing to us from a Ford assembly line in Dearborn, Michigan, on January 13, Dokoupil landed a marquee interview with Trump himself. With the sound of loud machinery in the background, the president didn’t bother to conceal his disdain. In response to a question about Iran, Trump seemed to imply that Dokoupil, a convert to Judaism, has dual loyalty to Israel.\n\n“I don’t know where you come from and what your thought process is, but you’ll perhaps be very happy,” Trump said.\n\nHis subtext doesn’t appear lost on the host, who responded, “What do you mean by that?”\n\nLater on, Trump disciplined Dokoupil again, this time in reference to his decision to greenlight David Ellison’s acquisition of CBS-owner Paramount Global. “You wouldn’t have a job right now,” Trump tells the anchor. “If she [Kamala Harris] got in, you probably wouldn’t have a job right now. Your boss, who’s an amazing guy, might be bust, OK? … You wouldn’t have this job, certainly whatever the hell they’re paying you.” At the interview’s close, Dokoupil attempted to save face, saying, “For the record, I do think I’d have this job even if the other guys won.” Without missing a beat, Trump responded, “But at a lesser salary.”\n\nFor all this taking it on the chin, Dokoupil and Weiss’s righteous reward was the White House threatening to sue over the interview.\n\n“CBS Evening News” with Tony Dokoupil demonstrated its obsequiousness by publishing “five simple principles” ahead of the new host’s debut. The “principles” are condescension for the Americans they claim to love all the way down. “We love America. And make no apologies for saying so,” reads one. Another proclaims: “We work for you.” (You quite literally do not.)\n\nPrinciple number three is “We respect you.” Its description reads in part: “We believe that our fellow Americans are smart and discerning. … We trust you to make up your own minds, and to make the decisions that are best for you, your families and your communities.”\n\nThis babytalk for idiots is a common thread running through the new era of “Evening News.” Dokoupil comes to us live from Real America — a stunt dubbed the “Live From America” tour — including the American Sign Museum in Cincinnati and a diner in the West Loop of Chicago. In Chicago, the broadcast includes a segment where the host takes the L train from the Loop to West Garfield Park to bring attention to the “death gap,” or life expectancy disparities, between neighborhoods. \n\nAs the train rumbles along, Tony looks out the window, affecting introspection, while his voiceover rolls: “Even on a snowy day, we could see a change from the train window,” he says, like a space alien seeing a city for the first time. At the end of the January 16 half-hour at a steel plant in Pittsburgh, which featured a “LESSON IN BIPARTISANSHIP” (in other words, a segment with Democratic Sen. John Fetterman and Republican Sen. Dave McCormick, both of Pennsylvania), Dokoupil all but waves a Made in USA American flag to show his love for the common man.\n\nIn concluding his second week on January 16, Dokoupil signs off by giving himself credit for a job well done. “What a privilege it’s been to hear from so many of you, to hear what matters in your lives. … We put some of your big questions in front of this country’s biggest leaders.” To underline the point that he really is one of us, he then appears to go perhaps a bit off-script. “I’m gonna talk to these steel workers,” he says. “You wanna trade jobs? This one’s not as easy as it looks! I’ve been learning that.” In an unintentionally comedic moment, multiple steelworkers respond “Yes.” \n\nThree weeks into his new job, it’s unclear who this incarnation of “CBS Evening News” is even for. Despite Weiss’s best efforts, the answer is not the White House, as Dokoupil can’t even succeed in flattering Trump. One possible answer is the old and the infirm: During every single commercial break I watched, multiple pharmaceutical ads ran, sometimes back to back, saying more about the state of America than Dokoupil ever could. \n\nAll this capping about love of country, and the host’s own posturing, speaks to an ambition of reconnecting with Americans who have lost faith in the media. Considering what we know about the Ellisons and their support for Trump, it’s not hard to imagine that the show’s new spin is an effort to reach MAGA America. But that’s a miscalculation at best and a dangerous slide to the right at worst, one that risks alienating the liberal viewership that still believes in institutions like CBS.\n\nMAGA adherents already have Fox News serving as de facto state TV news, and the disenfranchised among them have drifted so far outside any kind of consensus reality that they have embraced more fringe, far-right-wing outlets like One America News Network or the MyPillow guy. They are no longer “gettable” as an audience.\n\nWeiss and Dokoupil would be much better served if they tried seriously to retain the viewers they had, rather than chase imagined, untold millions of disillusioned Trump voters looking to come in from the cold. It speaks to a real confusion about who “CBS Evening News” is really for, if the true goal, as stated, is to grow its audience. But if the actual goal is to remake an authority in news into a platform for nakedly broadcasting Weiss and Ellison’s political views, it’s already a roaring success.","url":"https://theintercept.com/2026/01/25/tony-dokoupil-cbs-evening-news/","image":"https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Tony-Dokoupil-e1769203085943.jpg?fit=2000%2C1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 17:04:51","author":"Katherine Krueger","authors":["Katherine Krueger"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.123},{"id":395960262,"title":"Minneapolis: How Is This Not an Insurrection?","text":"Good Morning! Today is a chilly Sunday, Jan 25, 2026. Alexa says that today is World Leprosy Day. Today in History:\n\n1777: Americans drag a cannon up a hill on Kingsbridge Road in the Bronx, New York, to fight the British, giving added significance to the area’s historic name, Gunn Hill. The name of the road was changed to Gun Hill Road in 1875.\n\n1819: University of Virginia chartered by the Commonwealth of Virginia, with Thomas Jefferson as one of its founders.\n\n1825: First U.S. engineering college opens: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY.\n\n1840: American naval expedition under Charles Wilkes is first to identify Antarctica as a new continent. It remains the only continent with no countries.\n\n1881: Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell form the Oriental Telephone Company.\n\n1915: Transcontinental telephone service officially inaugurated as Alexander Graham Bell in NYC calls Thomas Watson in San Francisco, California, during the Panama–Pacific International Exposition.\n\n1918: Russia declares a republic of Soviets.\n\n1919: Founding of the League of Nations; first meeting occurs one year later.\n\n1945: Grand Rapids, Michigan, becomes the first U.S. city to fluoridate its water.\n\n1956: 96.5 cm (38.0\") of rainfall in a day at Kilauea Plantation, Hawaii (state record until 2018).\n\n1961: Walt Disney's animated film 101 Dalmatians, based on the novel by Dodie Smith and directed by Clyde Geronimi and Hamilton Luske, is released in the U.S.\n\n1970: The film MASH* is released.\n\n1993: Sears announces it is closing its catalog sales department after 97 years.\n\nBirthdays today include: Poet Robert Burns, author Virginia Woolf, Philippine President Corazon Aquino, singer Etta James, NASCAR driver Buddy Baker, Tōru Iwatani (inventor of Pac-Man), and Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nHere’s the preface question: For all the complaints we’ve been subjected to over the years about how Jan. 6 was an insurrection (for the record, it wasn’t), how is what we are now seeing in Minneapolis not an insurrection?\n\nAt the center of this mess right now, you have someone who showed up to the “protest” with a gun and a couple of clips, clearly intending to use that gun against federal law enforcement. True, he had been granted a carry permit, but he was not carrying either his ID or his carry permit as required by law. I’m seeing reports that the man shot by ICE, Alex Pretti, was part of a Signal group targeting ICE.\n\nThis is not about the Second Amendment as many of the supporters of those anti-ICE rioters claim. (Yes, I said rioter. It's not a protest when you are actively attacking federal officers.) \n\nEven absent any Second Amendment discussion, rule number one here seems a purely logical point. It's one that seems to be getting ignored by many: You simply do not pull a loaded gun on a federal officer doing his duty enforcing the law and expect to survive. \n\nSomewhat less reported was an incident mentioned by PJ Media’s Catherine Salgado.\n\nMcLaughlin explained, “In Minneapolis, these rioters attacked our law enforcement officer and one of them bit off our HSI [Homeland Security Investigations] officer’s finger. He will lose his finger.” What a proud victory for Walz and co.! They managed to ruin a brave officer’s life.Just ponder how deranged and bestial you have to be to seek out a federal law enforcement officer for the express purpose of assaulting him, and then deliberately bite off his finger. I can't help but think of Gollum biting off Frodo's finger at the climax of The Lord of the Rings to obtain the Ring; and the fiction has a parallel to the reality. As Tolkien meant the Ring to represent sin and evil, and as Gollum is destroyed and driven mad by it, so leftist domestic terrorists seem drunk on and driven mad by their lust for violence and revenge.\n\nAnd she correctly notes:\n\n It seems long past time for President Donald Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act. In the chaos and violence following the death of an armed Minneapolis would-be terrorist shot while fighting Border Patrol, another protester has bitten off the finger of a federal officer.\n\nOver at Powerline, Scott Johnson notes:\n\nFifth District Rep. Ilhan Omar sits in Congress and comes to town occasionally to rouse the rabble. Former Nation of Islam hustler Keith Ellison burrows from the inside as Minnesota Attorney General. Tim Walz mouths the obligatory platitudes and shibboleths as nominal leader of the state. Amy Klobuchar — the most popular Democrat in the state — has gone along for the ride.\n\nEvery single one of these people Scott mentions swore to uphold the Constitution. That’s a promise they are clearly breaking.That alone required an enforcement response. \n\n This was an inevitable result of Democrat-enabled chaos and relentless demonization of federal immigration enforcement. The suspect wasn’t merely armed with a loaded handgun, but had extra magazines, clearly willing to take action against federal officials.President Donald Trump has now reacted to the incident with a Truth Social post that framed the shooting as proof of broader lawlessness, failed leadership, and massive corruption in Minnesota, and possibly hinted that he may invoke the Insurrection Act as a result.\n\nUnquestionably, that would be an entirely appropriate action because what we’re seeing and hearing sounds pretty insurrection-y to me. \n\nJust think: If Kamala Harris had done her job as Border Czar during the Biden Administration, none of this would be happening.(Okay, stop laughing.)\n\nTrump remarked in an interview a couple of weeks ago that he didn’t think the threshold for using the Insurrection Act had been met. (A couple of weeks… Good God, has it really been that long?) I suggest that whatever threshold he was measuring by back then has certainly been met now.\n\nConsider: we have people, including state officials, openly and violently defying the enforcement of federal laws, including violent attacks on federal officers, and have for weeks now. Even now, they’re trying to leverage that shooting against ICE. All this is the very definition of insurrection.I'm with Catherine on this one.Mr. President, it's time to act. Invoke the Insurrection Act. Federalize the state militias. Restore order, and do it now, before this gets further out of hand. \n\nMaybe I'm reacting in anger, but things have reached the point where some anger is appropriate. So, I suggest that a nice touch would be treating the Minneapolis rioters in the same way the Democrats treated the J6’ers. Remember, up top I said J6 was not an insurrection? I point out that if it were, it would be the first insurrection in history where the supposed insurrectionists were unarmed. That line has now been crossed in Minneapolis. It's now time to act.Thought of the day: “If you don’t read the newspaper, you’re uninformed.

Why not a Democratic one?","text":"California once exported a national mood: confidence, growth, competence, a booming middle class, and large industries that represented national strength. That vision was the California that helped produce and endorse Republican presidents like Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, both from Southern California.\n\nModern California exports a different national image today: staggering costs, visible chaos, costly housing, soaring energy prices, and a politics that often seems geared toward deep-blue cities rather than the battleground states that determine presidential elections.\n\nThat branding shift explains why California has been able to elect Republican presidents but has struggled to produce a Democrat who can win a general election. It is also the challenge Gavin Newsom cannot ignore.\n\nWhen Nixon and Reagan rose, California’s identity aligned with broad national instincts. The Golden State possessed a strong national security credibility. California’s defense and aerospace stance conveyed seriousness and purpose, not just ideology. Additionally, the state’s strength was a broad middle class. The state represented a piece of the broader American Dream: a good-paying job, a home, and a future. Lastly, California had a competitive political culture. Candidates needed to win real swing voters within the state before attempting to win them nationally.\n\nCalifornia was also a presidential bellwether for a long period, reinforcing the idea that its politics were linked to the country’s core.\n\nGavin Newsom has repeatedly said that California is still the model. If true, it makes him a viable presidential candidate; if not, it hampers his chances of running and winning in 2028.\n\nDuring his recent State of the State address, Newsom stated: “In California, we are not silent… We are a beacon. This state is providing a different narrative. An operational model, a policy blueprint for others to follow.”\n\nHe also embraced the idea that criticism is outdated or irrational, dismissing opponents as people suffering from “California Derangement Syndrome” and telling “them,” specifically Donald Trump and his spokespeople, that “it’s time to update your talking points.”\n\nThat line might resonate in Sacramento, and with partisan Democrats nationwide, but to most Americans, his rhetoric hits differently. “Talking points” are not just talking points; they reflect lived experiences for voters who see California as a warning sign: high housing costs, taxes, regulations, disorder, and a governing culture that seems allergic to correction.\n\nCalifornia’s biggest political liability isn’t a single policy; it’s the result of decades of poor policy choices. The state feels unaffordable and overly managed.\n\nThat is why the migration story matters. People vote with their feet when costs conflict with quality of life. Domestic migration trends have been a consistent part of the California story, and the current trend reinforces the national view that the state is no longer the future of America. Governor Newsom’s claims of a “reversal” is a headline trick. California is still losing people to other states — it’s just being offset by international migration.\n\nIn presidential politics, perception turns into shorthand, and shorthand becomes reality.\n\nThis reality is Governor Newsom’s Achilles’ heel, as he tries to sound tough and impatient, especially on homelessness. “No more excuses, it’s time to bring people off the streets, out of encampments, into housing, into treatment. Counties need to do their job!”\n\nThose are talking points from a governor who recognizes the nation’s vulnerability: the footage of a downtrodden humanity in multiple cities remains undeniable. For many swing-state voters, California has become known for increased spending and reduced results. Remember the George H.W. Bush ads about Boston Harbor against Michael Dukakis? The ads against a Gavin Newsom presidential campaign write themselves.\n\nJerry Brown and Kamala Harris faced the same underlying dynamic: a Democrat from California doesn’t just run as an individual. They run as a symbol of California governance.\n\nCalifornia has voted Democratic for president in every election since 1992, which Democrats statewide boost, but this one-party domination creates a national paradox: the state’s leaders are rewarded for winning debates within a deep-blue coalition, while presidents are elected by forming cross-regional majorities of swing voters.\n\nNewsom’s final state-of-the-state address and his appearance at Davos feel like a national audition, and the underlying message is clear: he is aiming to rebrand California as “the blueprint.”\n\nIs the country buying the brochure?\n\nNixon and Reagan benefited from a California that represented America in motion. Newsom is attempting to nationalize a California that many voters view as America’s warning sign.\n\nHe can attack the critics. He can mock “derangement.” He can call the state a “beacon.”\n\nBut as long as California’s main export remains the cost-of-living crisis and visible disorder, a California Democrat, and one from San Francisco at that, will keep losing the same argument in the same states: not over ideology, but over basic competence and lived reality.\n\nMatthew Klink is a Los Angeles-based Republican political consultant who has worked on political campaigns internationally, nationwide, and in 40-plus states.

The footage of agents killing Alex Pretti is profoundly disturbing.\n\nIt all comes after the Trump administration’s deployment of thousands of ICE agents, who have been harassing and terrifying the residents of the twin cities of Minneapolis and St Paul in the midwest state of Minnesota since early December.\n\nIt is the second large-scale upheaval in the lives of all ordinary people in this decade after the city became the epicentre of the Black Lives Matter movement following the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Or third — if you count covid.\n\nMinnesotans have had enough. Small acts of resistance against the might and power of the federal government being brought to bear on their city are all adding up to more than the sum of their parts. But there’s only so much they can do when, in the words of state governor Tim Walz, “you ask for peace, we give it — and we get shot in the face on the streets”.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Trump says he supports protesters in Iran. Yet here his well-funded, heavily armed private police force — which outnumbers the regular police five to one — is inflicting chaos on this liberal city.\n\nThe people say they are acutely aware how important it is to stand up to this now. They want the world to know what is happening. They want it to be known what they’re doing about it.\n\nPeople are being pulled from their beds by agents wielding assault rifles, children are being detained and sent away on flights to destinations hundreds of miles away, and individuals with black or brown skin are unwilling to leave their home in case they don’t come back. They believe this will be unleashed on another city, and another, if it is left continue unchecked.\n\nThere’s something rotten in the state of Minnesota. And Minneapolis is teetering on the brink.\n\n‘Not just one isolated’ incident\n\nDrogheda native Dermot Cowley moved to the US 40 years ago. For the last 27 years, he has run O’Donovan’s pub in downtown Minneapolis — one of the last Irish-owned Irish pubs here.\n\nBefore covid and the murder of George Floyd in 2020, the queue for his pub was out the door and downtown was buzzing. It’s right across the road from the stadiums that are home to the city’s baseball and basketball teams. He employs people from all sorts of backgrounds.\n\nBut it’s been one thing after another, and all of it adds up to keeping people away from the city. This latest action from ICE is just the latest and worst step. There’s barely any traffic on the roads and footfall was slow when the Irish Examiner visited O’Donovan’s late last week.\n\n“It’s the energy in the city, it’s just been hindered so much by all of this,” says Mr Cowley.\n\n“It’s not just one isolated thing, it’s a combination and we’re being showcased now on a national and world level like Minneapolis is a horrible place. Which it really isn’t.\n\n“Probably half the restaurants in downtown are gone since covid. And the others that are open, like myself, we’re probably operating at 60% of what we used to.”\n\nNearing the age of 60, Mr Cowley has lived his entire adult life in the US. He says what’s happening now with ICE’s invasion of the city is unlike anything he has ever seen, ensuring any recovery in the downtown area is firmly on hold.\n\n“I just became a grandad. She’s a little one-year-old, and I’m looking at her and thinking ‘what’s her future?’,” he says.\n\n And my kids have coming to me going: ‘We don’t want to raise our daughter in this environment'\n\nAlthough Minneapolis and St Paul historically did have strong numbers of Irish people coming over, and has a strong enough Irish-American population to sustain multiple Irish dance schools and a strong music and arts scene, the number of Irish-born immigrants living here is relatively small compared to other major US cities.\n\nDonnelly visa\n\nBorn and raised in Tullamore, engineer Ruairí Barnwell recently moved to Minneapolis from Chicago and set up the Ireland Network Minnesota to link with other Irish-born people living in the twin cities and wider state.\n\n“The Department of Foreign Affairs does a fantastic job connecting with the diaspora around the globe, and here in America,” he says.\n\n“But I would say we too often lean into the ‘ah sure isn’t it great we have 32m Irish Americans’.\n\n“There’s only about 130,000 off-the-boat Irish in America, which is way down from the ‘Donnelly visa’ days.\n\n“In the state of Minnesota, there’s only about 500 and that’s conservative.”\n\nThe “Donnelly visa” was a special US immigration lottery programme in the late 1980s/early 1990s that gave tens of thousands of Irish people a pathway to legal residency, having been introduced by congressman Brian Donnelly.\n\nMr Barnwell adds: “There’s not many Irish illegals here, so what’s happening now isn’t having that direct an impact. But it’s that wider community part too.\n\n“This is affecting the whole city what’s going on.”\n\n‘Precaution worth taking’\n\nBelfast-born musician Danny Diamond moved to Minneapolis in the winter of 2019, so his time here has taken in the mass demonstrations and chaos that followed the murder of George Floyd by a police officer.\n\n“I felt a bit stunned as it played out in front of me,” he says.\n\n“But there was a huge energy coming off of people, the people were really rising up. It was destructive at times, but it was really powerful.\n\n“And what’s happening now feels more oppressive. It feels like it’s coming from top down upon us, and it feels worse. But it also engenders a lot of oppositional energy, a lot of anger, and focused anger from the people en masse can do great things.”\n\nLike so many others, Mr Diamond has taken to bringing his passport with him everywhere he goes. In case after case, it is clear that ICE is engaging in racial profiling, with people of colour much more likely to be stopped by ICE than white people.\n\nThis indiscriminate targeting is making people afraid to go to shops, work, or school. Even people with the legal right to be here — and even citizens — are being apprehended by ICE in terrifying situations before later being released because there’s no cause to keep them.\n\nIn this context, carrying your passport around is a “precaution worth taking”.\n\n“You don’t fully realise until you check yourself and say: ‘Jesus, I’m doing that now,’” says Mr Diamond.\n\n“My friends back home, they don’t do that. It’s markedly different.”\n\nDespite these challenges, Mr Diamond is among the many residents of the twin cities who express pride at the action being taken against ICE.\n\nCommunity activists are braving the freezing cold temperatures at all hours of the day to patrol their neighbourhood, warn others when ICE agents are in the area, and film agents to try to ensure they don’t breach people’s rights.\n\nPeople are delivering food and other supplies to the homes of families who are afraid to leave the house.\n\nTens of thousands of people, meanwhile, take to the streets in downtown, in –25C temperatures, calling for ICE to get out of their city.\n\nAll the while they are ignoring the smears of the federal government labelling them domestic terrorists and paid agitators.\n\n“I’m really proud that we live here, because I do feel that there must be something in this community that aggravates or threatens the regime,” says Mr Diamond .\n\n“It’s almost like a symbol or beacon of resistance that they really want to hit here first and hit here hard. It’s horrible, but we must be doing something right to be in that position.\n\n“If everyone helps, they can’t arrest the entire city, you know what I mean? Not yet, anyway. There’s great power in that.”\n\nLittle time for action\n\nICE can turn up on your street at any time. The shock-and-awe tactics of turning up at a house with heavily armed agents to arrest people can blindside people, leaving little time for action.\n\nBut communities are rallying around the communal places targeted by ICE: Schools, places of worship, even bus stops.\n\nAoife* began to notice attendance falling off a cliff in the aftermath of Renee Good’s murder.\n\n“It got to a point where the school district said they had to find an alternative,” she says.\n\n“Some of these families are not leaving their homes. When we found this out, our first concern was food— how do we get food to them without revealing who they are?\n\n“So we have to try match up resources. And what I’m seeing is people coming together. They might not be the people who are going out protesting, but they’re collecting food and they’re getting food to hubs.”\n\nUnions have played a role in supporting teachers through issuing guidance on how to be safe if signing up to be community witnesses to video ICE activities and get it out there to the world.\n\nAoife took part in this herself and faced the consequences.\n\n“After one incident, I was followed aggressively in a car by what I think were agents trying an intimidation tactic. And again, this is in my own neighbourhood. I’m a science teacher. This is not normal.\n\n“And then there’s this layer of guilt as well, knowing that I can just walk out and go to a grocery store and I’m safer than some of my neighbours just because of the way I look, and it’s fundamentally un-American to treat people differently, especially based on the way that they look.\n\n This is just a vile thing. I was so upset by things that were happening last week that in my body it just didn’t feel like my own\n\nThe racial profiling is so intense that anyone who isn’t white can feel unsafe.\n\nThis immigrant hunt is based so heavily on race and “looking different” that even Native Americans in their ancestral lands are being targeted.\n\nMary LaGarde is the executive director of the Minneapolis American Indian Centre. She says a lot of the members of her community are afraid to leave their homes.\n\n“Initially, I know even I was scared. Now, it’s not being scared,” she says.\n\n“Now, it’s more [like] I’m angry. I’m angry at what is happening to our community. I’m angry that families are being torn apart and children are being detained. This is disgusting.”\n\nShe describes a situation where a Native American colleague witnessed ICE activity, but was subsequently boxed in her car by agents who had followed her.\n\n“Our community patrols were out, and they saw what was happening, ran over there, and surrounded her vehicle, and they were able to get her safely out and into a building so that she wouldn’t be detained by ICE,” says Ms LaGarde.\n\n“At this stage, all we want is ICE to leave Minnesota and quit terrorising our community.”\n\nThe legal route\n\nOne of the ways that communities are fighting back is through the legal route.\n\nIf someone is lifted by ICE, even in cases where their rights are breached, lawyers can still advocate for them.\n\nMany turn to the Immigrant Law Centre of Minnesota and its policy manager, Julia Decker. Given how indiscriminate the actions are, they are advising each person, regardless of their status, to consider the worst-case scenario.\n\n“Our detention hotline has been expanded to four days a week, with staff getting training, and the phone is just constantly ringing because it’s either people in detention or family members of people who are detained,” says Ms Decker.\n\nShe highlights how many of those detained are being taken out of the state.\n\nThey include five-year-old Liam Ramos, who was taken to a detention camp in Texas in a case that caused fresh fury last week.\n\nHis father has no apparent criminal record and a pending asylum case. They were taken away from their homes regardless. Liam’s school said an ICE agent told the boy to knock on the door and ask to be let into their house “in order to see if anyone else was home — essentially using a five-year-old as bait”.\n\nCases where people who were going through the correct routes to get status, or citizenship, but then get taken by ICE anyway are presenting a huge challenge for lawyers.\n\n“It sounds like a philosophical or existential question of what does legality mean if the federal government is just passing the line of what is legal all the time?,” says Ms Decker.\n\n When the law becomes irrelevant, what do you do? We were literally not trained to answer that question\n\n“I think it can be scary sometimes, knowing that certainly the federal government has not been shy about its dislike for people like us who are doing this work — in addition to, obviously, its dislike of immigrants. But this is what the moment calls for [us standing up], and we’re here to do that.”\n\nEveryone has an opinion of why Trump and his administration has chosen here for his first large-scale crackdown. Very few believe it is purely to do with immigration. This is very much a Democrat-voting state, and it has been for decades.\n\n Governor Tim Walz was the running mate of Kamala Harris, who lost out to Mr Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Mr Trump enflamed the situation in mid-January after alleging a billion-dollar fraud involving Somali immigrants, which are tens of thousands strong in Minnesota.\n\nRegardless of the reasons behind ICE descending in such numbers on the city, it’s happening now and nobody knows how long it will last.

The footage of agents killing Alex Pretti is profoundly disturbing.\n\nIt all comes after the Trump administration’s deployment of thousands of ICE agents, who have been harassing and terrifying the residents of the twin cities of Minneapolis and St Paul in the midwest state of Minnesota since early December.\n\nIt is the second large-scale upheaval in the lives of all ordinary people in this decade after the city became the epicentre of the Black Lives Matter movement following the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Or third — if you count covid.\n\nMinnesotans have had enough. Small acts of resistance against the might and power of the federal government being brought to bear on their city are all adding up to more than the sum of their parts. But there’s only so much they can do when, in the words of state governor Tim Walz, “you ask for peace, we give it — and we get shot in the face on the streets”.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Trump says he supports protesters in Iran. Yet here his well-funded, heavily armed private police force — which outnumbers the regular police five to one — is inflicting chaos on this liberal city.\n\nThe people say they are acutely aware how important it is to stand up to this now. They want the world to know what is happening. They want it to be known what they’re doing about it.\n\nPeople are being pulled from their beds by agents wielding assault rifles, children are being detained and sent away on flights to destinations hundreds of miles away, and individuals with black or brown skin are unwilling to leave their home in case they don’t come back. They believe this will be unleashed on another city, and another, if it is left continue unchecked.\n\nThere’s something rotten in the state of Minnesota. And Minneapolis is teetering on the brink.\n\n‘Not just one isolated’ incident\n\nDrogheda native Dermot Cowley moved to the US 40 years ago. For the last 27 years, he has run O’Donovan’s pub in downtown Minneapolis — one of the last Irish-owned Irish pubs here.\n\nBefore covid and the murder of George Floyd in 2020, the queue for his pub was out the door and downtown was buzzing. It’s right across the road from the stadiums that are home to the city’s baseball and basketball teams. He employs people from all sorts of backgrounds.\n\nBut it’s been one thing after another, and all of it adds up to keeping people away from the city. This latest action from ICE is just the latest and worst step. There’s barely any traffic on the roads and footfall was slow when the Irish Examiner visited O’Donovan’s late last week.\n\n“It’s the energy in the city, it’s just been hindered so much by all of this,” says Mr Cowley.\n\n“It’s not just one isolated thing, it’s a combination and we’re being showcased now on a national and world level like Minneapolis is a horrible place. Which it really isn’t.\n\n“Probably half the restaurants in downtown are gone since covid. And the others that are open, like myself, we’re probably operating at 60% of what we used to.”\n\nNearing the age of 60, Mr Cowley has lived his entire adult life in the US. He says what’s happening now with ICE’s invasion of the city is unlike anything he has ever seen, ensuring any recovery in the downtown area is firmly on hold.\n\n“I just became a grandad. She’s a little one-year-old, and I’m looking at her and thinking ‘what’s her future?’,” he says.\n\n And my kids have coming to me going: ‘We don’t want to raise our daughter in this environment'\n\nAlthough Minneapolis and St Paul historically did have strong numbers of Irish people coming over, and has a strong enough Irish-American population to sustain multiple Irish dance schools and a strong music and arts scene, the number of Irish-born immigrants living here is relatively small compared to other major US cities.\n\nDonnelly visa\n\nBorn and raised in Tullamore, engineer Ruairí Barnwell recently moved to Minneapolis from Chicago and set up the Ireland Network Minnesota to link with other Irish-born people living in the twin cities and wider state.\n\n“The Department of Foreign Affairs does a fantastic job connecting with the diaspora around the globe, and here in America,” he says.\n\n“But I would say we too often lean into the ‘ah sure isn’t it great we have 32m Irish Americans’.\n\n“There’s only about 130,000 off-the-boat Irish in America, which is way down from the ‘Donnelly visa’ days.\n\n“In the state of Minnesota, there’s only about 500 and that’s conservative.”\n\nThe “Donnelly visa” was a special US immigration lottery programme in the late 1980s/early 1990s that gave tens of thousands of Irish people a pathway to legal residency, having been introduced by congressman Brian Donnelly.\n\nMr Barnwell adds: “There’s not many Irish illegals here, so what’s happening now isn’t having that direct an impact. But it’s that wider community part too.\n\n“This is affecting the whole city what’s going on.”\n\n‘Precaution worth taking’\n\nBelfast-born musician Danny Diamond moved to Minneapolis in the winter of 2019, so his time here has taken in the mass demonstrations and chaos that followed the murder of George Floyd by a police officer.\n\n“I felt a bit stunned as it played out in front of me,” he says.\n\n“But there was a huge energy coming off of people, the people were really rising up. It was destructive at times, but it was really powerful.\n\n“And what’s happening now feels more oppressive. It feels like it’s coming from top down upon us, and it feels worse. But it also engenders a lot of oppositional energy, a lot of anger, and focused anger from the people en masse can do great things.”\n\nLike so many others, Mr Diamond has taken to bringing his passport with him everywhere he goes. In case after case, it is clear that ICE is engaging in racial profiling, with people of colour much more likely to be stopped by ICE than white people.\n\nThis indiscriminate targeting is making people afraid to go to shops, work, or school. Even people with the legal right to be here — and even citizens — are being apprehended by ICE in terrifying situations before later being released because there’s no cause to keep them.\n\nIn this context, carrying your passport around is a “precaution worth taking”.\n\n“You don’t fully realise until you check yourself and say: ‘Jesus, I’m doing that now,’” says Mr Diamond.\n\n“My friends back home, they don’t do that. It’s markedly different.”\n\nDespite these challenges, Mr Diamond is among the many residents of the twin cities who express pride at the action being taken against ICE.\n\nCommunity activists are braving the freezing cold temperatures at all hours of the day to patrol their neighbourhood, warn others when ICE agents are in the area, and film agents to try to ensure they don’t breach people’s rights.\n\nPeople are delivering food and other supplies to the homes of families who are afraid to leave the house.\n\nTens of thousands of people, meanwhile, take to the streets in downtown, in –25C temperatures, calling for ICE to get out of their city.\n\nAll the while they are ignoring the smears of the federal government labelling them domestic terrorists and paid agitators.\n\n“I’m really proud that we live here, because I do feel that there must be something in this community that aggravates or threatens the regime,” says Mr Diamond .\n\n“It’s almost like a symbol or beacon of resistance that they really want to hit here first and hit here hard. It’s horrible, but we must be doing something right to be in that position.\n\n“If everyone helps, they can’t arrest the entire city, you know what I mean? Not yet, anyway. There’s great power in that.”\n\nLittle time for action\n\nICE can turn up on your street at any time. The shock-and-awe tactics of turning up at a house with heavily armed agents to arrest people can blindside people, leaving little time for action.\n\nBut communities are rallying around the communal places targeted by ICE: Schools, places of worship, even bus stops.\n\nAoife* began to notice attendance falling off a cliff in the aftermath of Renee Good’s murder.\n\n“It got to a point where the school district said they had to find an alternative,” she says.\n\n“Some of these families are not leaving their homes. When we found this out, our first concern was food— how do we get food to them without revealing who they are?\n\n“So we have to try match up resources. And what I’m seeing is people coming together. They might not be the people who are going out protesting, but they’re collecting food and they’re getting food to hubs.”\n\nUnions have played a role in supporting teachers through issuing guidance on how to be safe if signing up to be community witnesses to video ICE activities and get it out there to the world.\n\nAoife took part in this herself and faced the consequences.\n\n“After one incident, I was followed aggressively in a car by what I think were agents trying an intimidation tactic. And again, this is in my own neighbourhood. I’m a science teacher. This is not normal.\n\n“And then there’s this layer of guilt as well, knowing that I can just walk out and go to a grocery store and I’m safer than some of my neighbours just because of the way I look, and it’s fundamentally un-American to treat people differently, especially based on the way that they look.\n\n This is just a vile thing. I was so upset by things that were happening last week that in my body it just didn’t feel like my own\n\nThe racial profiling is so intense that anyone who isn’t white can feel unsafe.\n\nThis immigrant hunt is based so heavily on race and “looking different” that even Native Americans in their ancestral lands are being targeted.\n\nMary LaGarde is the executive director of the Minneapolis American Indian Centre. She says a lot of the members of her community are afraid to leave their homes.\n\n“Initially, I know even I was scared. Now, it’s not being scared,” she says.\n\n“Now, it’s more [like] I’m angry. I’m angry at what is happening to our community. I’m angry that families are being torn apart and children are being detained. This is disgusting.”\n\nShe describes a situation where a Native American colleague witnessed ICE activity, but was subsequently boxed in her car by agents who had followed her.\n\n“Our community patrols were out, and they saw what was happening, ran over there, and surrounded her vehicle, and they were able to get her safely out and into a building so that she wouldn’t be detained by ICE,” says Ms LaGarde.\n\n“At this stage, all we want is ICE to leave Minnesota and quit terrorising our community.”\n\nThe legal route\n\nOne of the ways that communities are fighting back is through the legal route.\n\nIf someone is lifted by ICE, even in cases where their rights are breached, lawyers can still advocate for them.\n\nMany turn to the Immigrant Law Centre of Minnesota and its policy manager, Julia Decker. Given how indiscriminate the actions are, they are advising each person, regardless of their status, to consider the worst-case scenario.\n\n“Our detention hotline has been expanded to four days a week, with staff getting training, and the phone is just constantly ringing because it’s either people in detention or family members of people who are detained,” says Ms Decker.\n\nShe highlights how many of those detained are being taken out of the state.\n\nThey include five-year-old Liam Ramos, who was taken to a detention camp in Texas in a case that caused fresh fury last week.\n\nHis father has no apparent criminal record and a pending asylum case. They were taken away from their homes regardless. Liam’s school said an ICE agent told the boy to knock on the door and ask to be let into their house “in order to see if anyone else was home — essentially using a five-year-old as bait”.\n\nCases where people who were going through the correct routes to get status, or citizenship, but then get taken by ICE anyway are presenting a huge challenge for lawyers.\n\n“It sounds like a philosophical or existential question of what does legality mean if the federal government is just passing the line of what is legal all the time?,” says Ms Decker.\n\n When the law becomes irrelevant, what do you do? We were literally not trained to answer that question\n\n“I think it can be scary sometimes, knowing that certainly the federal government has not been shy about its dislike for people like us who are doing this work — in addition to, obviously, its dislike of immigrants. But this is what the moment calls for [us standing up], and we’re here to do that.”\n\nEveryone has an opinion of why Trump and his administration has chosen here for his first large-scale crackdown. Very few believe it is purely to do with immigration. This is very much a Democrat-voting state, and it has been for decades.\n\n Governor Tim Walz was the running mate of Kamala Harris, who lost out to Mr Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Mr Trump enflamed the situation in mid-January after alleging a billion-dollar fraud involving Somali immigrants, which are tens of thousands strong in Minnesota.\n\nRegardless of the reasons behind ICE descending in such numbers on the city, it’s happening now and nobody knows how long it will last. What most agree on is that, with each passing day, the harm deepens. Tens of thousands marched on Friday calling for ICE to get out of their city. The very next day, agents shot a man dead.\n\n“Minnesota has had it,” says Mr Walz. “This is sickening. The president must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now.”\n\nSuch pleas have fallen on deaf ears so far. The longer it goes on, there is fear that things could still get far worse before they get better.\n\n *Name changed to protect identity","summary":"After a second fatal shooting in a matter of weeks, Irish immigrants and Irish Americans are among thousands taking to the streets, amid freezing temperatures, to fight off the intimidation","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/spotlight/arid-41781911.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9889/4944932_6_seoimage1x1_GettyImages-2255109760_1_.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 14:20:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com,Sean Murray","authors":["Irishexaminer.com","Sean Murray"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.404},{"id":395936102,"title":"In Oregon’s most flippable U.S. House district, why have Republicans struggled to recruit a strong candidate?","text":"With Democrats positioned to potentially retake control of the U.S. House of Representatives this year, the spotlight in Oregon is on the 5th Congressional District, which Rep. Janelle Bynum flipped from red to blue when she narrowly defeated one-term incumbent Lori Chavez-DeRemer in 2024.\n\nNational Democrats named Bynum among the 26 most vulnerable of their House members heading into the 2026 midterms, raising the question: Can Republicans reclaim the seat?\n\nIn some ways, the Republican Party response has been surprising: The best candidate state and national party leaders have managed to recruit is a 74-year-old two-term Deschutes County commissioner who has been staunchly pro-President Donald Trump and acknowledges she does not yet have name recognition in Clackamas County, the district’s largest population base.\n\nBut experts say it’s actually not a big eye-opener that no better-known, more battle-tested or moderate Republican has agreed to take on Bynum.\n\nThe district’s voter make-up, while the closest thing to a swing district in Oregon, somewhat favors a Democrat in any year, they say. But this year Democrats have a decisive advantage due to Trump’s low approval rating among Democrats and independents.\n\n“This would be a tough district for Republicans to target in any cycle,” said Erin Covey, editor for U.S. House races at nonpartisan elections newsletter the Cook Political Report. “If you talk to both parties, they would tell you they don’t expect this race to be competitive in 2026,” she said, no matter how impressive a candidate the Republicans were to put forth.\n\nPatti Adair, the strongest Republican candidate who has entered the race, says she has the fundraising chops, personality and track record to have a realistic shot at winning the seat. \n\n“I get things done. I care about people,” Adair said in an interview from her pickup truck in which she is already criss-crossing the district. “My positivity has to come through.”\n\nBut even Kerry McQuisten, head of the newly formed Oregon Conservative Caucus that works for Republican wins, acknowledges it will be “a heavy lift” for any candidate from her party to retake Bynum’s seat.\n\nIn some ways, the relative weakness of the Republican field, which also includes Jonathan Lockwood, a political communications consultant who has never held elected office, is less an indication that Republicans made lackluster efforts to recruit candidates than a sign of Democrats’ triumph at drawing a congressional district map, said Nathan Gonzales, editor of Inside Elections, which provides nonpartisan analysis of campaigns for the U.S. House.\n\nWhile Democratic candidates have typically prevailed statewide over Republican ones in recent cycles, they’ve done so by margins similar to 53% to 43%. Yet five of the six congressional districts legislative Democrats drew in 2021 – 83% of them in other words – have proved to favor candidates from their party, he said. Only one, covering nearly all of eastern Oregon, gives Republicans a realistic shot this year, Gonzales said.\n\n“One of the goals of the redistricting process (in the eyes of the dominant political party) is to take as many seats as possible off the table” for the opposing party, he said. “I am not sure that all five districts, particularly the 5th, are never going to be a battleground. But under these political circumstances this midterm cycle, it’s tough to see how the Republicans could win it.”\n\nNationally, prospects for Republicans are also bleak, although there are exceptions and the November election is more than nine months away, analysts at Cook Political Report, Inside Elections and elsewhere have noted. Republicans hold just three more House seats than Democrats do. And of the 18 seats that the Cook newsletter rates as true “toss ups” that could readily be won by either party, just four are held by Democrats while 14 are currently in Republican hands. (One of the four Democrats it deemed that vulnerable is Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, the two-term Democrat representing southwest Washington’s 3rd District.)\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the U.S. House, labeled Bynum as “vulnerable” for 2026 largely because she’s a first term member in a district that previously elected a Republican – not because they genuinely believe a Republican can beat her this year, both Covey and Gonzales said.\n\n“It’s more of a signal to donors that ‘This member could have a tough race and please, please send them money’ than Democrats thinking she’s on the brink of defeat,” Gonzales said.\n\nFor their part, both Bynum and the Democratic Party of Oregon insist they can’t take her victory for granted – even as they say her accomplishments in her first term make it clear she’s the perfect fit for her district. \n\n“I have never worried about my opponents and I have always focused on the electorate,” Bynum told The Oregonian/OregonLive Thursday. Being one member of the 435-member U.S. House “keeps you very, very humble. So anybody that listens to the pundits and they say, ‘Oh, you’re a shoo-in,’ that’s the kiss of death. … I don’t think I’ve ever shown myself as somebody that guaranteed myself a win. …If I have come from behind, then somebody else could too.”\n\nNathan Soltz, chair of the state Democratic Party, told The Oregonian/OregonLive that he believes Bynum is “by far the strongest candidate” but that the party will take seriously whoever emerges as her Republican challenger.\n\n“We know how hard national Republicans (and) state Republicans are gonna be trying to pick up this seat,” he said. “We are confident we can beat them back, but we never take anything for granted.”\n\nOregon’s 5th District was dramatically redrawn in 2021 when Democrats in the Legislature were allowed to draw boundaries adding a new 6th District to the state’s congressional map. To bolster their advantage in neighboring districts, they removed some traditional Democratic strongholds from the 5th and instead extended its reach to take in the fast-growing and increasing blue area in and around Bend.\n\nThe upshot was that the 5th District became the state’s closest thing to a swing district. That, plus national Democrats’ decision not to put big money behind their party’s 2022 nominee, Jamie McLeod-Skinner, opened the door for Chavez-DeRemer’s narrow win that year. Notably, both Bynum and Chavez-DeRemer, now Trump’s Secretary of Labor, had name recognition in Clackamas County, where they each held elected office before running for Congress.\n\nCovey, the Cook Political Report expert, said national Democrats’ public posture about the race this year does not match what Democrats in D.C. have told her candidly about their level of concern. And she noted that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris outpolled Trump, then at a height of popularity, by 8 points in the 5th District in 2024.\n\nHer nonpartisan newsletter, widely regarded as among the most authoritative on congressional politics, rates the 5th District race as “likely Democrat,” meaning it is “not considered competitive at this point.” \n\nGonzales, of Inside Elections, says key Republican Party officials and campaign consultants he’s talked to have also written off the 5th as unwinnable. His newsletter, which last year started out rating the 5th District race as “leaning” blue, now rates it “solid Democratic.”\n\n“It’s clear right now that Oregon is not a priority for the Republican Party” in its battle to hang onto the House, he said. When he asked party leaders and consultants who they were hoping to recruit for the race, “like give me any names,” he said he was met with “radio silence.”\n\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive had a similar experience. Among the Republican Party officials who did not answer requests to discuss the strength of their 5th District candidates: Oregon Republican Party Chair Connie Whelchel, National Republican Campaign Committee spokesperson Christian Martinez and former Oregon Senate Republican Leader Tim Knopp, who lives in the district.\n\nCurrent voter registration in the district stands at 31% Democrats and 27% Republicans, with 35% not affiliated with any party.\n\nAdair, meanwhile, acknowledges it’s an uphill battle but doesn’t believe the race is unwinnable.\n\nMoney is one big part of the equation, she said, and she said she has raised “millions” of dollars for nonprofits, primarily in California, including the hospital in Santa Monica where her husband used to work and for the public schools in Malibu that her sons attended.\n\nThe day she announced her run for Congress in November, she said, officials with the Washington, D.C., based Republican National Campaign Committee contacted her, which she said was “a compliment to me and what I have been able to accomplish” during eight years in county office.\n\nAdair said they told her that to prove her viability as a candidate, she needed to prove herself at fundraising. She said she’s subsequently raised more than $200,000. That money came from an “amazing cross-section” of donors, many with ties to members of her “enormous” family that includes five younger sisters, she said. Her campaign does not have to report how much money she raised as of Dec. 31 or the identities of her donors until the Jan. 31 reporting deadline.\n\nAdair acknowledges she must make huge inroads in Clackamas County to win the seat and said she has not yet been endorsed by any key political figures there. She points to her record, which she said includes helping save a Bend city park, secure two additional circuit court judges for Deschutes County and push for greater access to mental health care.\n\nDespite Trump’s deep unpopularity in the 5th District, Adair says she won’t disavow her strong support for the president.","summary":"The best candidate party leaders have managed to recruit is a two-term Deschutes County commissioner who is staunchly pro-Trump and has yet to secure an endorsement in the district's largest population base.","url":"https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2026/01/in-oregons-most-flippable-us-house-district-why-have-republicans-struggled-to-recruit-a-strong-candidate.html","image":"https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/C2KVYTTDFVDH7GG2SRB7EOAUMY.jpg?auth=fc791b3b1fcfe26f2f5d4fa99ed27e84a65c1dac9a84c4d2acef9c5a61723610&width=1280&smart=true&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 14:00:01","author":"Betsy Hammond","authors":["Betsy Hammond"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.002},{"id":395925838,"title":"Trump Unveils Surprise Legal Action Plans for 2020 Election at Davos","text":"During a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, former President Donald Trump suggested that legal action is imminent against individuals involved in the 2020 election, which he continues to incorrectly assert was “rigged.”\n\nIn a departure from his prepared remarks, Trump made this bold claim, reiterating his stance that the ongoing conflict in Ukraine would have been avoided had he secured a second term in office.\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine escalated in February 2022 when Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated an invasion, occurring over a year after President Joe Biden took office.\n\nTrump addressed the audience by saying, “And it wouldn’t have started if the 2020 U.S. presidential election weren’t rigged,” maintaining his unfounded allegations of election fraud. “It was a rigged election,” he added.\n\nHe further stated, “Everybody now knows that. They found out. People will soon be prosecuted for what they did,” hinting at forthcoming prosecutions without providing specific details.\n\n‘Everybody now knows that. They found out. People will soon be prosecuted for what they did,’ he continued. \n\n‘That’s probably breaking news, but it should be – it was a rigged election, can’t have rigged elections,’ Trump added.\n\nTrump has long pushed that he lost the 2020 election due to widespread voter fraud, instead of voters’ discontent over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nBiden was able to flip back the blue wall of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan that Trump had won in 2016 over Democrat Hillary Clinton and add several traditionally red states, including Arizona and Georgia, to his column. \n\nDespite the president’s historic political comeback in the 2024 election, beating Biden’s No. 2, Vice President Kamala Harris, to become only the second president in history to win non-consecutive terms, Trump continues to bring up the 2020 election burn.\n\nSome of the top voices in the MAGA movement have wanted to see Attorney General Pam Bondi look more into the 2020 race. \n\n‘Folks are desperate for action and just haven’t seen it,’ Steve Bannon, Trump’s former White House chief strategist, told the Wall Street Journal in an interview earlier this month.\n\nBannon said the president’s supporters have wanted to see movement on cases related to the 2020 election and also the 2016 election related to the Russia probe.\n\nIt’s unclear who would be indicted in a 2020 election case. \n\nIn the aftermath of the election, Trump and his allies filed 62 cases contesting the election results, with nearly all dismissed over a lack of standing or evidence. \n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court overruled one initial Trump campaign win, which dealt with whether first-time voters could be asked for photo identification if they wanted to ‘cure’ their mail-in ballots. \n\nAt the same time, several Trump-aligned officials, including his personal lawyer, former New York City Mayor, have gotten in legal trouble over their roles in trying to overturn Biden’s win. \n\nLast April, Giuliani, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and other Republican officials who signed a document submitted to Congress falsely saying Trump won the election were indicted in Arizona.\n\nThere were also droves of prosecutions related to January 6. \n\nTrump was impeached for a second time, after leaving office, for inciting an insurrection on January 6, 2021. \n\nHe was acquitted in the Republican-led U.S. Senate.\n\nHis rhetoric at a ‘stop the steal’ rally at the Ellipse led to thousands of Trump supporters ransacking the U.S. Capitol. \n\nIn the years following the Capitol attack, more than 1,500 rioters were charged with crimes, but Trump pardoned them all shortly after taking office for a second time last year.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDuring a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Unveils Surprise Legal Action Plans for 2020 Election at Davos first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/trump-unveils-surprise-legal-action-plans-for-2020-election-at-davos/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Trump-says-prosecutions-are-coming-over-the-rigged-2020-election.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 13:41:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.155},{"id":395931328,"title":"‘This was never about food’: Scholars in palak-paneer case say ‘Dogs and Indians’ mindset persists in West","text":"Two Indian scholars made headlines recently about winning a $200,000 settlement in the US in a racial discrimination lawsuit. As dust settles on the sensational settlement, they tell Firstpost's Bhanu Pratap what exactly happened and why they filed the lawsuit. Were they so touchy about somebody not liking the smell of palak paneer, the famed Indian household dish?\nThey tell Firstpost that it was never about food. That it happened on a US campus and the person making \"pungent\" remarks was British, who got institutional backing from American betrayed the same racist mindset Indians have heard and read stories from their grandparents and books detailing colonialism.\nThe palak-paneer incident\nWhat began as a disagreement over reheating a lunchbox has, for two Indian scholars, come to symbolise something far older and deeper than a campus dispute. “This was never about food,” Aditya Prakash and his fiancée Urmi Bhattacheryya say, reflecting on the episode that led to a civil rights lawsuit and a $200,000 settlement with a US university. Instead, they argue, it exposes what they describe as a lingering “Dogs and Indians” mindset — a hierarchy of culture and belonging they believe still shapes how Indian identity is received in Western institutional spaces.\nSpeaking to Firstpost, the two scholars — who had filed the lawsuit after a row over the “smell” of palak paneer heated in a departmental microwave — said the incident was less about a single remark and more about dignity, power and the subtle ways in which culture can be marked as out of place. They describe the episode as part of a broader pattern of what they call “olfactory discrimination”, where food associated with South Asia is treated not as neutral, but as intrusive — a stigma they link to older colonial attitudes that have never fully disappeared.\nFor them, the case that unfolded in laboratories, faculty meetings and eventually legal filings was not a fight over a lunch break, but over the right to carry one’s culture into shared spaces without apology.\nThis occurs even as Western academia continues to build knowledge and careers by researching marginalised communities in India, without extending the same respect to those cultures when Indians carry them into Western spaces, they said.\n‘A racist slur’: When food stops being neutral\nThe incident occurred on 5 September 2023, about a year after Prakash joined the university. He was reheating his lunch—palak paneer—in a departmental microwave when a female staff member approached him, objected to the “smell,” and asked him not to use the microwave to heat his food.\nPrakash told Firstpost’s Bhanu Pratap that the language used to describe his food is “commonly deployed as a racist slur against Indians.”\n“This is a very particular phenomenon in the West, where the smell—or the so-called perceived smell—of food stops being neutral the moment it is associated with the Global South, especially South Asia,” he said.\n‘I tried to reason’: Attempting to resolve quietly\nPrakash said his first instinct was to address the matter directly and calmly.\n“I told her I did not appreciate the comments she made about my food. I tried to reason with her. She is from Yorkshire, from Britain, and I said that given the number of Indians, Pakistanis, and other South Asians, she would have some familiarity with this kind of food. But even if she did not, basic respect for another person’s food, whether Indian or otherwise, is simply human decency,” he said.\nAccording to Prakash, the staff member denied making any inappropriate remarks.\n“She asked, ‘What comments?’ So I told her she had called my food ‘pungent’. Each time, I kept saying that I would be done in a minute.”\nHe said he consciously tried to de-escalate the situation, aware of the broader challenges South Asian students often face.\n“Food is just food. I was thinking about what happens to South Asians—especially Indians—who face this kind of behaviour every day. Someone has to say it’s not OK. This was never about taking someone to task.”\n‘Food just smells’\nPrakash stressed that there is no objective hierarchy when it comes to food smells.\n“There is no scale where one kind of food smells worse than another. Food just smells, and these ideas are culturally determined. At its core, this is about mutual respect. In the West, food has been used against us in a very specific way, reinforced through stereotypes in popular culture—from The Simpsons to the character of Apu.”\nHe initially believed the remarks may have stemmed from ignorance rather than malice.\n“Even then, I felt it might have come from ignorance. That is why I spoke directly to her and said food is just food, and that I would be done in a minute,” Prakash said.\nHowever, the situation escalated when the staff member insisted he should not heat his food in that microwave because it was close to where she sat.\n“That is where it became deeply problematic. Questions of food and shared space are also questions of power. The fact that she was white and British altered the context significantly,” Prakash said.\n‘Dogs and Indians not allowed’ in a modern US university\nThe incident, he said, evoked painful historical stigmas rooted in colonial discrimination.\n“Many of us grew up hearing stories from our grandparents about life before 1947, when public spaces carried signs saying, ‘Dogs and Indians not allowed’. To see something like that being recreated today in the US, in a public university, in an anthropology department—a discipline meant to study culture—is deeply disturbing. That, in a sense, is the one-line description of what happened.”\nBoth Prakash and Bhattacheryya reiterated that the case was never simply about food.\n“It was about dignity, belonging, and the quiet humiliations that many Indians abroad learn to endure,” they said.\nPrakash added that Indians are typically ridiculed in the West in two enduring ways.\n“One is our accents. Everyone has an accent, but it is deeply unfair to demean someone for how they speak. The other is our food, which is half of one’s being. This is the food I grew up on—the food my mother fed me. There is a historicity to food, and I felt that was being attacked.”\nParatha-sabzi and prejudice: Early lessons in Italy\nPrakash recalled encountering similar discrimination earlier in life. “When I was in Italy during my school days, I carried paratha-sabzi for lunch, and other students would sit away from me. That really hurt me. I first encountered this at 14, and then again nearly two decades later, at 32. Time had passed, but the context in the West remained unchanged.”\n‘A stain that will never go away’\nFollowing the incident, he said, the matter was escalated internally rather than resolved.\n“If there was no ill intent, the simplest response would have been to apologise and move on. Instead, it was escalated. Faculty became involved in a deeply demeaning manner. When other students brought Indian food in solidarity—a very Indian form of civil disobedience—there was no sloganeering, nothing of that sort, yet it was portrayed as a riot.”\nThe department later banned all students from using the microwave.\n“I said in a meeting that this would further stigmatise our food. I said, ‘This is a stain that will never go away.’ Everyone eats, and everyone will feel this impact—from public figures like Kamala Harris to migrant workers.”\nPrakash said this marked the moment when discrimination became institutionalised.\n“I could not allow my culture, my food, my country to be insulted in an institutional way.”\nFear and quiet suffering among Indians abroad\nAfter the incident, Prakash and Bhattacheryya wrote about it on social media. Responses poured in from across the US, the UK, and India, many from people who had faced similar discrimination. They were also subjected to online trolling and racist abuse.\n“People said they were afraid to open their lunchboxes in common spaces. Some said they ate in their cars to avoid scrutiny,” Prakash said.\nBhattacheryya said the responses revealed how deeply normalised such racism remains.\nA THREAD ON RACISM: My partner @Wayseller and I, who are Indian PhD students in Anthropology at@CUBoulder\nhave been facing systemic racism and suppression of our voices within the department. Please read, and retweet. It has been a horrific two weeks for us. (contd. in thread) pic.twitter.com/y8NWX6MMki\n— Urmi (@Urmi_1990) September 16, 2023\n“One set came from Indians sharing similar experiences. The other was vicious racist trolling—comments like ‘All Indians smell’, ‘Go back’, or calling our food ‘dog food’. Terms like ‘curry muncher’ were repeatedly used.”\nShe said the episode demonstrated how racism operates both overtly and institutionally.\n“Over the next two years, it became a pattern of retaliation after retaliation simply because we asserted that our food doesn’t need permission to exist.”\nAcademic fallout and settlement\nBoth said their academic careers were directly affected. Advisory committees resigned without explanation, new advisors outside their research fields were imposed, and they lost research funding and teaching roles—developments even university deans described as unprecedented.\n“It jeopardised our careers, our grants, and our future prospects,” Bhattacheryya said. “It was also very lonely. Our department was our academic home, and that camaraderie disappeared.”\nDespite completing the programme with perfect GPAs and securing multiple grants, both ultimately left the PhD programme.\n‘Even powerful institutions can be held accountable’\n“This case shows that even powerful institutions can be held accountable,” Prakash said. “Racism against Indians comes at a cost. Many people have faced this for decades, but we wanted to send a clear message to Western institutions that discrimination carries social and economic consequences.”\nHe stressed that the lawsuit was never about money.\n“It was about making a point—that there are consequences to discriminating against Indians for their Indianness.”\nBhattacheryya described the outcome as a moral victory.\n“There is accountability here. Public scrutiny forces institutions to realign,” she said, adding that the case highlights what she described as “olfactory racism”—a long-normalised trope used to dehumanise Indians.\nThe lawsuit was settled in September, a step typically taken to avoid prolonged and costly court proceedings. Under the terms of the settlement, the university agreed to confer degrees on the students while denying all liability. The agreement also bars them from studying or working at the institution in the future.","url":"https://www.firstpost.com/world/palak-paneer-pungent-smell-case-us-university-indian-phd-scholar-200000-settlement-lawsuit-institutional-racism-13972082.html","image":"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2026/01/ChatGPT-Image-Jan-25-2026-06_54_48-PM-2026-01-d4937d4df740cfa22e8f40515c1313f2-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 13:29:14","author":"Bhanu Pratap","authors":["Bhanu Pratap"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.245},{"id":395928470,"title":"TEVI TROY: Shapiro's revenge once again reveals Kamala Harris' incompetence","text":"When Kamala Harris wrote in her memoir \"107 Days\" that Pennsylvania governor – and fellow Democrat – Josh Shapiro insisted on being \"in the room for every decision\" if he were to become vice president, an angry Shapiro characterized her account as \"bullsh--\" and \"blatant lies.\" But Shapiro’s own forthcoming memoir demonstrates that he is not done getting back at Harris. His book includes the explosive and damaging tale that in the Harris team’s hostile vice-presidential vetting process, Shapiro was asked if he had ever been an Israeli agent, bringing to mind the ugly association of Jews and dual loyalty. The story is harmful to Harris in a number of ways. It reinforces the existing impression that she and her team were clumsy, but also adds the dimension that they may have been antisemitic. Indeed, even Joe Biden’s former envoys on antisemitism have denounced the Harris team’s questioning as \"horrifying.\" Shapiro’s devastating tale is a reminder of Harris’ failure to understand a basic rule of life in the political big leagues: Don’t dish it out in your memoirs and get caught unawares when your targets respond. In the modern, staff memoir-writing era, there have been numerous instances of aggrieved officials hitting back hard against memoirs that attacked people ostensibly on the same political team. A great example of this kind of revenge happened in the wake of Arthur Schlesinger’s Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir of his time in the Kennedy administration, \"A Thousand Days.\" Some in the Kennedy camp were annoyed with Schlesinger’s account, including former first lady Jackie Kennedy, who told Schlesinger that he had gotten \"too personal\" with some of his revelations. Even more irked was Kennedy’s secretary of state, Dean Rusk. Schlesinger wrote that Kennedy had been thinking of firing Rusk and that the \"Buddha-like\" Rusk would say little in White House meetings. Rusk, who was still the secretary of state for Lyndon Johnson when the book came out, let it be known that he was only silent around Schlesinger because Schlesinger was a notorious gossip on the Georgetown cocktail party circuit. Sometimes, responses to a book can be less ad hoc and more systematic. Charlie Kolb, a domestic policy aide to President George H.W. Bush, wrote a critical memoir called \"White House Daze,\" which came out in 1993, after Bush had lost to Bill Clinton. The memoir was particularly harsh on Kolb's boss, Roger Porter, as well as Bush’s Office of Management and Budget Director Dick Darman, with whom Kolb had clashed in the White House. Bush staffer Tom Scully, who had been an aide to Darman, dismissed the very idea of Kolb having had the access for writing a revealing book, saying, \"Charlie was so cut out of everything that for him to be in a position to write a book was a joke.\" Scully was not alone in being unhappy with Kolb, as the Bush alumni collectively froze Kolb out. In 1999, years after the administration ended, Scully – who had endorsed Kolb’s hiring to begin with – recounted that \"Nobody’s talked to Charlie in seven years that I know of. He’s the most unpopular guy as a result of that book.\" Unlike the Kolb book, George Stephanopoulos' \"All Too Human\" came out while President Clinton was still in office. Stephanopoulos’ revealing memoir called out the sitting president’s behavior in the Monica Lewinsky affair as \"stupid, selfish, and self-destructive.\" Clinton staffers responded to Stephanopoulos' best-selling book both on and off the record. Anonymous aides called Stephanopoulos a \"backstabber\" and an \"ingrate.\" Clinton ally Mandy Grunwald also sniped that if Clinton hadn’t given him the \"opportunity of a lifetime,\" he wouldn’t have become a \"multimillion-dollar book writer and commentator.\" KAMALA HARRIS DISPARAGES WASHINGTON POST, LA TIMES OVER NON-ENDORSEMENTS IN 2024 Another damaging memoir that came out during an administration was Scott McLellan’s \"What Happened.\" McLellan made a number of criticisms of President George W. Bush, writing that Bush \"convinces himself to believe what suits his needs at the moment,\" and that he engaged in \"self-deception.\" McLellan also called the invasion of Iraq a \"serious strategic blunder,\" and claimed that the Bush White House made \"a decision to turn away from candor and honesty when those qualities were most needed.\" The Bush White House responded with a seemingly organized effort to dismiss McLellan’s book. After the memoir came out, multiple Bush allies criticized McLellan with similarly crafted talking points. Senior Adviser Karl Rove said, \"This doesn’t sound like Scott. It really doesn’t. Not the Scott McClellan I’ve known for a long time.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION These types of pushback are, of course, fair game from those targeted in a negative memoir. John Bolton probably expected President Trump to criticize him and even call him a \"liar\" following Bolton’s critical memoir of his time in the first Trump administration, \"The Room Where It Happened.\" He probably did not expect Trump’s second term, in which Bolton is being investigated for misuse of classified information, an investigation that probably would not have happened but for the book. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Memoir writers do not have to take people on by name, as Harris did to Shapiro. Sometimes memoirists call out anonymous antagonists. Examples of this include John Podhoretz, who created composite characters in his George H.W. Bush book \"Hell of a Ride,\" and Condoleezza Rice, whose memoir of the George W. Bush years, \"No Higher Honor,\" is replete with over 20 uses of anonymous characters. This could be a way to spare someone’s feelings, but it could also minimize the odds of someone taking revenge. When someone is criticized by name, as Shapiro was, the odds of blowback are much higher, as Harris has now learned. Memoirs are part of the game, but Harris should have known that taking on a savvy player like Shapiro was not without cost. If she had paid more attention to history, she might have been aware of the risks she was taking in calling out Shapiro. Her lack of awareness of what other politicos have done in response to poor memoir depictions is just one more sign of her lack of aptitude for politics – and left her vulnerable to Shapiro’s revenge.

Why?","text":"Vendors sat with produce, soaps, homemade sweets and jewelry in booths along the sidewalk at an east-side Detroit farmer’s market.\n\nAt their backs, a crowd of individuals with graying hair gathered in the accompanying lot. Many held signs lambasting President Donald Trump.\n\nIt appeared to be a gathering of the “new Detroit,” said a neighborhood man who had been passing by.\n\nIt was a July 2025 “Good Trouble Lives On” rally invoking the memory of late civil rights leader U.S. Rep. John Lewis.\n\nSet in the 80% Black neighborhood of East English Village, it served as a stark example of a theme: Anti-Trump protesters and rallygoers in metro Detroit tended to be White in 2025, even in the predominantly Black and liberal city of Detroit.\n\nIt’s a pattern found by national researchers. Across four major anti-Trump actions in 2025, the majority of protesters surveyed were White and female.\n\nWhy that is and what the future holds depends on who is asked.\n\nSome would-be protesters in the Black community who spoke with the Free Press were already engaged in grassroots actions outside of mass mobilizations. Some were fearful that the presence of Black bodies would increase the likelihood of police action against protesters. Some said they already did their part by voting and marching in the past; it was time for White people to step up.\n\nA few Detroiters were pro-Trump. Others did partake in the protests, and still others now wished to participate. Some, too, said they didn’t like Trump but did not feel aligned with those organizing or attending the protests. \n\nMultiple vendors in East English Village expressed support for the gathering. That passing neighbor joined in. And Jacinda Cason, who organized the event and is Black, saw the White turnout as both positive and expected. She runs a racial traumatic healing effort called Encompass Lives Full Circle, works for the Black Voters Matter advocacy group, and said she promoted the rally through a website more likely to draw a White crowd.\n\n“It’s always the people of color that does this work,” but White community members sit at tables, at family dinners, that Black community members don’t, Cason said. White attendees can carry the necessary messages to those tables. \n\nThe crowd was hopefully full of “co-liberators,” willing to be more active and vocal than mere allies, she said. \n\nWho’s protesting?\n\nThe demographics of Detroit perhaps make the differing demographics of the protests more obvious than they would be elsewhere, said one metro Detroit organizer. \n\nBlack residents make up 78% of the city’s population, according to 2020 U.S. Census Bureau data. It went for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in 2024, even as Trump won the state and picked up thousands more votes in the city than in prior campaigns. \n\nDana Fisher, director of American University's Center for Environment, Community, & Equity and a professor focused on civic engagement and activism, has surveyed protesters at mass gatherings for years and across various administrations with her team. \n\nThey’ve found that during Trump’s time in office, attendees of permitted, large-scale protests have tended to be White, highly educated, older and female. \n\nThose characteristics are unique to Trump’s time in office and were amplified the second time around, said Fisher, citing surveys at three D.C.-based protests and one Philadelphia-based protest in 2025. \n\nWhen weighing why that is, she noted some people of color opted out of her anonymous surveys at protests in 2025 due to concerns someone might come after them.\n\nAdditionally, she said, permitted, large-scale, single-day, performative protests organized by professional groups, like Indivisible, tend to involve networks with progressives in privileged communities.\n\nYounger people and people of color are coming out in different spaces, like smaller-scale protests on the ground in cities where the National Guard and additional immigration agents have been deployed, she said.\n\nAlvin Tillery, director of Northwestern University’s Center for the Study of Diversity and Democracy, who also leads a strategy firm for Democratic efforts, observed the protests nationally to be diverse overall, but also said they probably are slightly more White in attendance.\n\nResource limitations could contribute to that. Even on weekends, shift workers may be occupied, he said. There are the costs of childcare and transportation. Crowds appear to include more retirees than working-age individuals.\n\nThen there are the personal feelings at play.\n\nWatching the protests with wary eyes\n\nJalita Leitch, 41, of Detroit, is not a fan of the president or his policies, and protest is one way she has fought establishments in the past.\n\nBut ahead of one of the first larger protests of 2025, she saw discussions online in the Black community about not going. She understood the reasoning, including the voting records at play. \n\nBlack voters across the country continued to overwhelmingly vote Democratic in 2024, even as Trump saw some gains, according to the Pew Research Center. White voters have voted for Trump at a rate of roughly 55% the last three presidential elections.\n\nThere was a sense of “we did our part,” Leitch said. \n\nTo note, while protesters surveyed by Fisher’s team overwhelmingly voted for Harris in 2024, White women overall gave their vote to Trump in the last three elections by margins ranging from 2 percentage points to 8. \n\nMore: Thousands attend \"Hands Off\" rallies across metro Detroit\n\nThe community concerns also went beyond voting, Leitch said.\n\n“They felt it wouldn’t be peaceful if they went out there,” Leitch said. That Black and Brown bodies would draw a stronger response from police.\n\nSeveral Detroiters mentioned this, raising the images of clashes with police during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in contrast to many marches seen in 2025.\n\nOnly several years ago, the city settled a lawsuit in which protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement in Detroit alleged excessive use of force that ended in a collapsed lung and brain bleeding, among other injuries. The Detroit Police Department defended its actions during those protests and sought to stop the payout.\n\nBlack and Brown individuals also continue to be killed by police at disproportionate rates, according to reporting from the New York Times. \n\nLeitch did end up going to that first protest with her union, but she opted out of others for the time being. \n\nGabriel “Kenyatta” Nichols, 63, of Detroit, also stayed back. \n\nHe’d heard the same worries about aggression against Black protesters. He heard calls from Black leaders to stay home.\n\nIt felt like it was the White community’s turn to “step up,” he said. To top it off, the anti-Trump protests in Detroit were seemingly organized more in White communities than in his own community.\n\n“So even though I’m with them in spirit … (it) didn’t feel like that protest was for us,” Nichols said, later stating: “Black people have been fighting for justice, they’ve been fighting against racism and White supremacy ... but many times we were out there marching and there wasn’t a White face around. … It felt good to me to see White people step and fight fascism.”\n\nFighting for a bad status quo\n\n“If Kamala Harris was president, we would all be at brunch.”\n\nThat’s what Detroit Will Breathe leader Tristan Taylor saw on a sign in photos of early anti-Trump protests. It was symbolic of the issues he saw with the anti-Trump protests early on: that participants wanted to return to the status quo and that the Democratic Party was involved.\n\nTaylor, who was a face of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in Detroit, isn’t interested in returning to the status quo.\n\nMore: We’ve had 100 days of Detroit protests. And it’s ‘just the beginning.’\n\nHe wants an overhaul in the country’s system of governance. He’s against imperialism. He’s anti-capitalist. He can’t support a status quo in which the judicial system disproportionally locks up Black and Brown people.\n\nIt was positive that thousands of people were mobilizing against Trump, but his group was still determining how they could show up within that, Taylor said in April 2025.\n\nDetroit Will Breathe did not become a formal organizer of an anti-Trump mass protest until the October 2025 No Kings Day.\n\nBy then, it seemed like there was more opportunity for the group’s stances as a result of seemingly growing anger over Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and immigration agents, growing frustration over lack of action by the Democratic Party and the candidacy of Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani for New York mayor, Taylor said.\n\nThe administration’s actions in Chicago also showed that Black people can’t sit on the sidelines, he said. (There, concerns were raised about arrests of Black residents by immigration agents.)\n\nYet, ahead of No Kings Day 2.0 in October, Taylor wouldn’t promise to lead other such actions afterward. \n\nHe wanted to make sure there was space for his group’s perspectives and wanted to be sure his group wasn’t simply providing cover for liberals unwilling to push back against Democrats and be militant.\n\nThe many shapes of resistance\n\nIt shouldn’t be construed that Black community members opted out of the Trump resistance in 2025. Black residents in metro Detroit both attended and led actions with anti-Trump sentiments.\n\nThere was Cason and her Good Trouble rally. Other community groups with Black leadership and members have attended protests and held rallies. Union-led efforts in particular drew Black protesters. And though predominantly White, Hands Off, No Kings and regular, daily efforts in metro Detroit included Black participants with signs in hand even before groups like Detroit Will Breathe took an organizing role in the Oct. 18 No Kings Day. \n\nYet protest and rallying are just one form of resistance, said protest scholars and longtime activists. \n\nTrump has moved people who have never demonstrated before to do so — grandmothers and older White people with canes and wheelchairs, said the longtime president of the NAACP Detroit branch, the Rev. Wendell Anthony, in April 2025.\n\nAnthony was pleased and proud to see people protesting, he said. \n\nBut “protest is the last remedy,” he said. “You try to talk, you try to negotiate, you try to work out situations before you take to the streets.”\n\nAnthony acknowledged that some in the community opted to let others protest after warning the world about Trump in advance.\n\n“We aren’t tired, we’re just strategic,” he said.\n\nAt the time, he said he expected more boycotts of corporations like the one in 2025 against Target for its walking back on diversity, equity and inclusion. And indeed, would-be Black protesters, including Leitch, said they withheld their dollar from certain businesses in a boycott in 2025. \n\nHistorically, it has taken a bevy of tactics to make change, said DeJuan Bland, a lead organizer with the Black-led community group MOSES Action and a minister at Faith Redemption Center Church of God in Christ in Detroit. \n\n“We’re at a moment where we need every tool in a toolbox, and so I think everybody can find a place in the resistance,” he said in April 2025. \n\nHe used the term “resistance,” for lack of a better term, however. To call it a “movement” suggested more of a shared strategy or a deeper relationship to shared work than there might be, Bland said at the time. Still, he was encouraged to see people activated.\n\nMOSES Action engaged on issues regarding SNAP and Medicaid before 2025 and already had programming focused on juvenile justice scheduled for the day of the April 2025 Hands Off nationwide day of action, Bland said. MOSES stuck with their plan but promoted a Hands Off event.\n\nMOSES Action also held events in Livonia to break down divides and took part in a bridge takeover focused on Medicaid. On a different day, MOSES held a town hall in a church, providing a largely Black crowd with information on how changes to Medicaid would affect them and what they could do. \n\nIn contrast, a primarily White gathering at a park in Milford that day featured fewer educational presentations and more anecdotal speeches with concerns.\n\nSome 2025 anti-Trump protests served as a catch-all for all things naysayers saw wrong with the Trump administration. Yet some protests, still with anti-Trump sentiments, sought to focus, one at a time, on immigration, the deaths of Palestinians in the Israel-Hamas war, health care, transgender rights and more. \n\nIn the city of Detroit, those tailored gatherings were observed to be smaller but to have more Black and Brown participants and involve a younger crowd. \n\nLooking ahead\n\nProtests appeared slightly more diverse toward the end of 2025 and particularly in 2026, following an immigration agent's fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis.\n\nMocha Brown, 31, of Detroit, joined Comité de Acción Comunitaria - Detroit (Detroit Community Action Committee) partway into 2025 primarily because of Palestine. Her group also has been vocal about making Detroit a sanctuary city amid immigration enforcement. \n\nDiverse perspectives are needed, and Brown would like to see more people out, but messaging and expected outcomes are more important, she said.\n\n“If it takes majority White crowds out there to get things done, if that’s what it takes, then that’s what it takes,” she said.\n\nOne Detroit Will Breathe organizer said a righter-leaning crowd than him at the October No Kings protest didn't make him want to keep attending. But Taylor and Detroit Will Breathe were at the forefront of protests following the fatal shooting in Minneapolis in 2026 of Renee Nicole Good.\n\nMore: Vigil, protest held for Renee Nicole Good at Detroit's Clark Park\n\nMore: Protesters blast Trump amid visit to Detroit; police detain multiple\n\nTaylor said there is a push to unify underway, and that unions, churches, city leaders and traditional civil rights leaders need to take up the cause.\n\nLeitch hoped to take part in protests going forward because “every day it gets worse and worse” with the administration.\n\nShe thinks people will need to take part in actions like general strikes to move the needle, too.\n\n“It’s important for all of us to unite and be out there in the forefront,” she said.\n\nBland was more willing to use the term “movement” in 2026 and said an “us versus them” mentality can’t be allowed, either in terms of method of action or in who is participating. All have a use. \n\nNichols said the scope of the anti-Trump protests needs to broaden to long-term concerns of the Black community, including racism and white supremacy.\n\nProtests matter, but Cason said it will take the administration seeing their own protesting in the streets that will make a difference. \n\n“Everybody has their lane, and we need to layer all of these to move the needle. … I’m going to stand 10 toes down when I say that the needle will not move unless it’s hundreds of thousands of White bodies in the streets.”\n\nData journalist Kristi Tanner contributed to this report.","url":"https://eu.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2026/01/25/black-activists-residents-anti-trump-protests/88264788007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/18/PDTF/86779514007-20251018-no-kings-fg-41.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2399,1350,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 11:02:16","author":"Detroit Free Press","authors":["Detroit Free Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":395877044,"title":"Trump's astonishingly bad polling shows he really isn't 'God's gift' to the US","text":"“God is very proud of the job I’ve done,” boasted Donald Trump on the first anniversary of his second term, as he brandished a breeze block-sized document, “365 wins in 365 days”, which catalogued everything from reduced unauthorised border crossings to stripping the “notorious crackhead and grifter Hunter Biden of his taxpayer-funded Secret Service detail”.\n\nTrump has long claimed to enjoy the imprimatur of the Almighty, frequently citing his narrow escape from being assassinated in 2024 as proof of his support from on high. \n\nBut his approval ratings, if not quite hellish, have certainly been more earthbound.

In the 2026 election, the map of Senate seats up for grabs appears to favor Republicans, making a state like Texas all the more alluring to a party hungry to flip both chambers of Congress. While many analysts pour cold water on Democrats vision to flip the southwestern state, that hasn't stopped donors from repeatedly pouring millions of dollars behind the effort. “We are living in unprecedented times, and so I think an unprecedented candidate is exactly what it's going to take to actually be able to flip this seat,“ Crockett, who first won election to the House of Representatives in the 2022 midterm, told Newsweek in an interview on Thursday. “One thing that I'm known for is to be an outside-the-box thinker. I want to take that to the next level and be that next level fighter that people need in this moment,“ she added. In the Democratic primary, Crockett will face off against state Representative James Talarico, who she previously served with in the Texas House prior to winning her seat in Congress. Both candidates have national profiles, having captured viral moments as they've pushed back in their respective ways against Republicans. Crockett, however, questions whether Talaraico has what it takes to fight back effectively in the era of President Donald Trump. She points to a time in 2021 when she, Talarico and other Democratic state lawmakers fled Texas to prevent quorum in the legislature in a bid to stall the passage of a bill viewed by Democrats as suppressing voting rights. Talarico ultimately was among the first group of those Democratic lawmakers to break ranks with his colleagues and return to Texas. “I’m home! Our quorum break shined a national spotlight on the TX voter suppression bill and pushed Congress closer to passing a federal voting rights act to override it. I’m confident they will,“ Talarico wrote in X, then known as Twitter, at the time. Referencing the incident, Crockett pointed out that she had stayed behind and that the federal voting rights act never passed as Talarico predicted it would. “Ultimately, there were people that decided that they didn't want to continue fighting. He was one of those people,“ she said. Meanwhile, Talarico's supporters have raised questions about Crockett's electability statewide in Texas, noting she's always won in safe blue districts whereas Talarico managed to flip a red seat to get elected to the state House. The likes of podcaster Joe Rogan, who famously endorsed Trump in 2024, have praised Talarico, and many view him as having crossover appeal with independents and Republicans. Polling results are mixed for the primary, with an Emerson poll released earlier this month showing Talarico leading Crockett by 9 points, (47 percent to 38 percent). However, in December, the Barbara Jordan Public Policy Research and Survey Center released results showing Crockett up 8 points, with 51 percent compared to 43 percent of her Democratic opponent. Crockett spoke with Newsweek in a wide-ranging Zoom interview on Thursday, discussing ICE funding, the Trump administration and how she plans to fight for Texans if she's elected to the Senate. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. Jasmine Crockett Interview Transcript Newsweek: It's been over 30 years since a Democrat was elected to the Senate from Texas. Why are you the candidate to change that? Jasime Crockett: We are living in unprecedented times, and so I think an unprecedented candidate is exactly what it's going to take to actually be able to flip this seat. Right now, the Republicans have been losing all over this country, and even when they're not losing, well, those margins are shrinking. But more importantly, I think that our base is hungry for something different. Anybody can kind of tell you that they're gonna write different bills and they're going to file bills, but the reality is that we have an administration that is not abiding by the law. They are actually ignoring and evading the law, even when Donald Trump signs the laws in himself. One thing that I'm known for is to be an outside-the-box thinker. I want to take that to the next level and be that next level fighter that people need in this moment. If it means that we've got to do things that maybe may make normal people or some other people feel a little uncomfortable, that's what we've got to do because we've got to bring attention to what is going on. We've gotta ring the alarms. It started when I was in the state House when we broke quorum in 2021. That wasn't like business as usual because the bills they were trying to pass were not business as usual. We were able to end up having a national spotlight on those issues, right? Right now we are about to take a vote and that vote is on DHS and whether or not we will give more funding to ICE. Right now I am willing to shut it down. I am going to do what it takes instead of just kind of being a go along to get along lawmaker. And make sure that I'm listening to the people that are in the midst of this fight, the people that are on the ground, the people who have always been my partners when I was doing things such as representing protestors as a civil rights lawyer. [Editors note: The DHS funding bill passed the House on Thursday with the support of seven Democrats. Crockett voted against it along with most of her caucus.] What would you say is your main message to voters in Texas? Number one has to be affordability. Right now, we don't have to live in an unaffordable Texas or unafforable country, but we do because there is no checks and balances on this out-of-control president. Right now, we need a senator that will put Texans first and not last. These out-of-control tariffs have caused the cost of everything to go up, but more importantly, not more importantly, but in addition, we know that our Texas farmers and ranchers are also struggling. They are currently filing record numbers of bankruptcies and experiencing record numbers of suicide right now. And that can be directly tied to what is going on with these trade policies that this administration has implemented, and no one has decided to rein in. When we start to talk about border security, which I think we have to go ahead and broach the conversation. Right now, the most insecure and most dangerous thing that this administration has done is decide to start wars without any authority from the Congress. We don't need that. We have checks and balance in a democracy for a reason. Whether we're talking about if we're gonna be more secure because we have an actual check, on whether or not bombs are gonna be dropped in various countries or whether we're talking about us having a check as it relates to the tariffs that are pricing so many businesses out of business, as well as making life unaffordable for us at the same time that we've not done anything to raise the wages in this country. Which is why I am a proud co-sponsor of Raise the Wage, because if you're gonna say the costs are going up, we at least need to make sure that pay is also going up.

(Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI/AFP via Getty Images) Now the choice that primary voters are gonna need to make is between you and James Talarico. Why should they pick you over him? There's a couple of things about that. Number one, I'm experienced, right? A lot of Democrats have been frustrated because they thought a candidate was gonna be able to say, function in this environment. And we know that the polling is clear that the Democratic base is not excited about Democrats as a whole. Instead, we need someone who we know can function in this dysfunctional environment and know that they're gonna fight, not just say it. Many people know that I always make sure I have receipts, right? There are receipts for how I fight on this level. We know that Mr. Talarico has been on the state level, and he's never been engaged in this type of fight. We don't know what will happen. We don't know if he will be able to thrive in this environment. What we do know is that in 2021, we broke quorum as a caucus. Mr. Tallarico and I were actually in the House together. Ultimately, there were people that decided that they didn't want to continue fighting. He was one of those people. When it comes to voting rights, I am a staunch believer in making sure that we fight to the end. Honestly, this election is a bit of a full circle moment, right? Because we know that if we had gotten somewhere on voting rights back then, we wouldn't be here. If when I was a freshman in the state House that it actually passed both chambers, then we wouldn't be dealing with this mid-decade redistricting. We wouldn't even have most likely a Donald Trump presidency because this idea that you could spend unlimited amounts of money the way that Elon Musk did to get him elected, well, that wouldn't have been a reality. Because that would have been precluded under the Freedom to Vote Act, right? We have to say, like, what skin in the game do you have to make us feel like we can be comfortable because it's easy to say what you would do until you're actually there. In addition to that, the fact that I'm an attorney is so important because we are the ones in the Senate that actually confirm everyone to the judiciary. Right now, when it comes to the Supreme Court, we need people that understand what a good judge looks like and a bad one. I don't know that we've ever had a candidate that has the level of a crossover that I do. I actually started my political career and my legal career in rural East Texas. So I'm someone that can go into the rural parts of Texas and feel very comfortable because that's where I live. So I understand what it is to live there. In addition to that, I am a PK [preacher's kid] and so I show up at Black churches on Sundays and I talk to them. What our polling reveals most importantly is that the Democrats have been losing certain demographics. They have been losing demographics when it comes to African Americans, they have been losing Latinos. These are both demographics that I've actually been leading in poll after poll. And the one other part that a lot of people aren't talking about is the fact that we know that we've been losing the working class, right? We've been determined to be the party of the educational elites. I am overperforming with that particular class, working class folk. In fact, in our most recent polling, I am performing 20 points better than Mr. Talarico. When you're looking at bringing that coalition back together, that coalition that allowed Democrats to win, they are gravitating towards me. You talked about DHS and the funding that you plan to oppose. I believe you've also signed on to the effort to impeach Kristi Noem. Some critics probably say that's a waste of time and that there's no chance of this passing. Why do you think that's important? And do you think it is something that will pass? I think it's important to do what is right. It is always a good time to do what is right, and I want to signal to my constituents, as well as the rest of the country, that there is a significant problem with this particular DHS secretary. And when you have people that are being killed in broad daylight, if your only excuse for not signing on is nothing's gonna happen, then it almost gives a permission structure. It is almost complicit in these actions. We still have democracy, at least some portions of it at this point. And so yes, I signed on to that. Do I think it will happen? Probably not, but maybe, right? Because we also didn't think that we would end up getting a three-year tax subsidy for the Affordable Care Act passed out of the House, but because Democrats led on this issue, we were able to do it. We also didn't think that would ever get the entire House to vote on the Epstein files, but we were able to do it, right? I will say never say never. But we have to at least try, and I think that that is why people have been frustrated with the Democrats. It's because they're thinking you were in position and you're not even trying. Don't tell me what can't happen. Just do your part and try to make it happen. That's why I say that there is a difference in how some people fight. This is a moment in which we can't ask for permission. We've just got to make sure that our base knows that we are fighting for them and that we see the wrong that is happening. If we sit around and act like it's business as usual, then I think that that's where you end up seeing Democrats saying, 'What is the point? I'm going to just stay home because there's no difference between the parties.' That is when people get disillusioned. You mentioned how you're leading in polling with Latino voters. Previously, you've gotten some criticism for comments you made about “picking cotton“ and “slave mentality,“ referring to Latino voters. Can you talk about those comments? What's your response to the criticism of that? Obviously, none of these things came about during the time. They were not big things. These are things that have been taken out of context because we are in the middle of an election. That's what happened with the elections. So, thank you for an opportunity to make it very clear. As a Black woman, a lot of things that I experienced, I experienced them in the lens of a Black woman. My comparison points will consistently be with the history that I am aware of, the history that many of the people in my family have lived. Honestly, I see a shared struggle between Latinos and African Americans. When I refer to ICE patrols as slave patrols, that's kind of how they look to me, but that is a reference point, right? That is how I see them. But at the same time, I think that it is a shared point of struggle. To get the full context of the Vanity Fair interview, I was specifically asked about Latinos that decided to vote for Trump, who were against immigration, right. And I talked about real conversations that I had. I think most people know that I was on the trail. I traveled nonstop on behalf of both [former President Joe] Biden as well as [former Vice President Kamala] Harris once Harris became the nominee. And I had real conversations with real people on the ground because I wanted to understand why it was that we were losing certain people. So, I explained some of those conversations. To me, it was reminiscent of different conversations that have had as it relates to the Black community. But this is not about offending, or it's not about even separating us because everything that I've done has actually been in standing in unity for all of us because I do believe that we are stronger together. Obviously, in the context of campaigns, there's going to be little things that come out and that kind of stuff. And I just ask that people be clear about my record. I have never once said any of the crazy things that Donald Trump said about Latinos, ever. I've never decided that there would be this wide sweeping brush where I call people “rapists“ and all these other terrible things that he said. I never did that; I never would do that. If anyone ever felt like it was me trying to be disrespectful, that's not what it is. I have reference points that are based on the fact that I'm a Black woman. Honestly, I see more that brings Black and brown together than divides us. And as a civil rights lawyer, I have always fought for the rights of everyone because that's just kind of how I'm built. And that was way before I was ever running for office. You've talked a bit about voters being disillusioned with some of Democrats for not fighting. A lot of anger has been directed at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. If you are elected to the Senate, would you support him to continue on as leader? Or do you think there needs to be a change there? You are going way, way far ahead of me. We don't even know what's gonna happen in these elections. Ultimately, what happens is we usually get here and the caucus has an election. There may be someone running, there may not be someone running. I can tell you, for instance, on the House side, no one is running against [House Minority Leader] Hakeem Jeffries. Hakeem Jeffries will be the speaker of the House, right? I don't know the dynamics within the Senate. I don't know how they come to their conclusions. For me, I'll just be happy to be there. And definitely if there are multiple candidates that are running, I obviously would want to listen to everyone that is running and support the candidate that makes best sense for that moment.

(Photo by Jill Connelly/Getty Images) Another big issue to a lot of Texans is they love their guns. Democrats are seen as being opposed to guns. How do you balance that as a Democrat from Texas? I'm a gun-toting Texan. I don't really know what to tell you. Like I am for real Texan, right? I'm licensed to carry and there's no requirement that you be licensed. I do believe in licensing. I do believe in red flag laws, and as someone who is on the receiving end of my fair share of death threats, definitely, I think red flag laws are a big deal. I think closing any gun show loopholes is really important as well, but I think sometimes people try to say, “Well, Democrats gonna take all your guns.“ No, we just wanna make sure that kids, hopefully, aren't gonna be killed while they're sitting in their classrooms. We wanna minimize how many guns get into the hands of bad guys, right? So that's it. I think I have pretty basic kind of reforms that I agree with as it relates to gun legislation. People can be assured that before I was in office, I was licensed and I was carrying. I did criminal defense. So, it only made sense for me to do that. Those are my main questions, but I just want to open it up if there's anything else that you feel like is important for our readers to know? I think it's just really important for us to know whatever races you're looking at in this moment, our country is breaking. And the easiest thing for me to have done would have been to fight and figure out how to get back to the House. There were Democratic seats that were still left. It's moments like this that you realize who the real leaders are. Doing the uncomfortable thing when the Supreme Court decided four days before the end of filing to go after these seats, even though they did not overturn the underlying opinion that was written by a Trump-appointed justice that said that these lines were racially discriminatory, it just told me how bad it is. I couldn't continue to sit there knowing that we had an opportunity. Based on the numbers, my internal polling had me ahead of a Republican. And most recently, another poll came out that had me a head of a Republican. I've been in this race for a month and close to a half right now, and we can do this. But if we allow people to continue to tell us what we can't do, if we allow people to make us play politics as usual, we won't get it done. Final point I'll say is that I remember when I announced that I hearkened back to a 44-year-old junior senator out of Illinois, who had to have been told over and over, “No, you can't,“ to the extent that his mantra became, “Yes, we can.“ They told him, “No there's never been somebody that looks like you. No, here's never be anyone with that type of middle name. No, you can't do it.“ But he invoked in the people a spirit of hope. And I want people to be hopeful in this dark time.","summary":"Jasmine Crockett told Newsweek an &quot;unprecedented candidate is exactly what it&#039;s going to take&quot; for Democrats to win in Texas.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jasmine-crockett-texas-senate-ice-trump-talarico-11412306","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Exclusive-Jasmine-Crockett-on-Texas-Senate-Run-ICE-and-James-Talarico.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 09:00:00","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.215},{"id":395829970,"title":"The Blogs: Beings in Yetzirah: Ontological Politics in the 2028 Election","text":"Rather than treating the 2028 presidential field as a contest of policies or ideologies, I read it as a contest of political beings — different forms of authority through which legitimacy becomes intelligible to the public.\n\nTo make that legible, I draw on a distinction from Kabbalistic metaphysics between Assiyah, the world of action, and Yetzirah, the world of formation. Assiyah names what political actors do: campaigns, policies, votes, and institutional maneuvering. Yetzirah names something deeper: the forms through which political authority itself becomes recognizable — the emotional, symbolic, and moral grammars by which power coheres and persuades.\n\nUsing Yetzirah, we can ask not merely what candidates support, but how they exist politically: what grammar of authority they embody, and how power gathers around them before it ever expresses itself as policy.\n\nThe Four Political Beings\n\nThe 2028 field coheres around four distinct Yetzirah forms — grammars of legitimacy through which authority becomes believable.\n\nYankeedom: Authority through procedure, institutional continuity, legitimacy via law, process, and inherited political grammar.\n\nWestern Marxism: Authority through structural critique, systemic moral diagnosis, and antagonistic framing of power and inequality.\n\nQuakerdom: Authority through moral coherence, ethical witness, relational trust, and personal credibility, independent of systems.\n\nGreater Appalachia: Authority through identity, narrative, cultural embodiment, and civilizational symbolism, rather than governance competence or moral philosophy.\n\nMost candidates are hybrids — a reflection of a system in ontological fracture.\n\nWhat follows is not a speculative typology detached from political reality, but an ontological reading of the actual 2028 field as it exists today. The ordering and relative weight of each figure reflects their current standing in the RealClearPolling polling average, using empirical reality to anchor symbolic form.\n\nThe Democratic Field: Political Beings in Yetzirah\n\nGavin Newsom (23.6) — Yankeedom / Western Marxist\n\nNewsom embodies the late-liberal governing form: procedural legitimacy fused with moralized systems language. His authority arises from presenting institutions as workable but in need of ethical recalibration, rather than replacement or moral witness.\n\nKamala Harris (21.4) — Western Marxist / Yankeedom\n\nHarris draws her authority first from structural moral claims — representation, justice, and symbolic redress — and second from procedural competence. She operates as a figure whose legitimacy is anchored more in what she stands for than in how she administers.\n\nPete Buttigieg (11.0) — Yankeedom / Quakerdom\n\nButtigieg is a morally serious institutionalist: he speaks in ethical and civic language while remaining deeply loyal to procedural legitimacy. His authority comes not from structural antagonism, but from presenting civic virtue as the precondition for institutional survival.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez (7.7) — Western Marxist\n\nOcasio-Cortez’s authority flows entirely from systemic critique rather than institutional loyalty or moral stewardship. She acts symbolically by naming power, inequality, and structural injustice, positioning legitimacy as something seized through exposure rather than earned through procedure.\n\nJ.B. Pritzker (4.8) — Yankeedom / Western Marxist\n\nPritzker operates as a technocratic reformer with moral vocabulary: legitimacy through delivery, stabilized by equity-oriented rhetoric. He does not dramatize injustice nor embody moral witness, but instead presents governance itself as the moral act.\n\nJosh Shapiro (4.6) — Quakerdom\n\nShapiro’s authority arises not from systems critique or procedural mastery, but from relational trust and perceived ethical coherence. He leads as a moral steward, deriving legitimacy from being seen as personally credible rather than ideologically correct or structurally oppositional.\n\nAndy Beshear (3.4) — Quakerdom\n\nBeshear embodies political authority as moral presence rather than political performance. His legitimacy flows from local trust, emotional steadiness, and a style of leadership that presents public office as ethical caretaking rather than ideological struggle.\n\nTim Walz (3.2) — Western Marxist / Yankeedom\n\nWalz fuses class-inflected structural rhetoric with institutional executive experience. He draws authority from naming systemic economic tensions while remaining firmly committed to operating through established procedural channels.\n\nMark Kelly (3.0) — Quakerdom\n\nKelly’s political authority rests in personal credibility and seriousness rather than ideological clarity or narrative performance. As a senator, he derives legitimacy from restraint, biography, and perceived adult supervision rather than from moral dramatization or systemic critique.\n\nCory Booker (3.0) — Yankeedom / Western Marxist\n\nBooker operates as a procedural liberal animated by structural moral language. His authority arises from combining institutional fluency with a persistent emphasis on systemic injustice, inequality, and reform, positioning governance itself as a vehicle for moral redress rather than moral formation.\n\nTaken together, the Democratic field remains oriented toward restoring legitimacy through procedure, structure, and moralized governance.\n\nThe Republican field, by contrast, contests legitimacy on entirely different terrain.\n\nThe Republican Field: Political Beings in Yetzirah\n\nJ.D. Vance (48.8) — Greater Appalachia / Insider\n\nVance embodies political authority through civilizational narrative rather than procedural legitimacy or moral philosophy. His power arises from presenting himself as the voice and embodiment of a particular America, rather than as a steward of institutions or a reformer of systems.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. (11.0) — Greater Appalachia / Insider\n\nTrump Jr. extends the same ontological form, functioning less as a policy actor than as a symbolic inheritor of a civilizational identity. His authority flows from lineage and narrative continuity rather than institutional credibility.\n\nMarco Rubio (9.3) — Yankeedom / Greater Appalachia\n\nRubio represents a transitional political being: procedural conservatism attempting to survive within an identity-centered political field. His legitimacy is split between institutional fluency and narrative appeal.\n\nRon DeSantis (9.0) — Yankeedom / Greater Appalachia\n\nDeSantis fuses executive proceduralism with civilizational signaling, governing through institutions while framing authority in cultural conflict and identity assertion.\n\nRFK Jr. (4.3), Tulsi Gabbard (3.0), Vivek Ramaswamy (2.5) — \n\nGreater Appalachia / Outsider\n\nThese figures operate primarily as challengers to established authority rather than as institutional or moral stewards, deriving political force from questioning the coherence of prevailing narratives and sources of legitimacy rather than embodying them.\n\nTed Cruz (3.3), Glenn Youngkin (2.0) — Yankeedom\n\nResidual procedural conservatives attempting to operate in a political environment no longer organized around procedure.\n\nThe Ontological Fault Line\n\nWhat this analysis ultimately reveals is not a disagreement over policy, nor even ideology, but a conflict over the very forms through which political authority becomes legible in contemporary America.\n\nOn the Democratic side, power remains distributed across competing grammars of legitimacy. Yankeedom and Western Marxism stand in near parity, reflecting a party torn between restoring institutional authority and morally reinterpreting it through systemic critique. Quakerdom persists as a meaningful but structurally secondary form, reminding us that moral formation and relational trust remain electorally viable, even if they are no longer how the party primarily understands power.\n\nIn other words, Democrats are still arguing about how legitimacy should be repaired.\n\nThe Republican field, by contrast, is no longer organized primarily around legitimacy at all. Its center of gravity has shifted decisively toward civilizational identity, here named more precisely as Greater Appalachia. Authority now flows less from law, institutions, or moral philosophy than from cultural embodiment, narrative inheritance, and symbolic belonging. Yankeedom survives, but only as a minority grammar, subordinated to identity as the primary source of political power.\n\nRepublicans are no longer arguing about how America should be governed.They are arguing about who gets to be America.\n\nThat is the true fault line of our political moment.\n\nThis is why so many policy debates feel hollow, repetitive, or unresolvable: they are downstream of a much deeper ontological rupture. We are not merely disagreeing about what to do. We are disagreeing about what kind of beings are entitled to rule, to speak, and to represent the nation.\n\nUntil that conflict is understood and addressed, politics will continue to feel simultaneously overheated and empty — full of noise, yet strangely detached from resolution.\n\nAmerica is not in a policy crisis.It is in a crisis of political being.\n\nAnd until we learn to speak at that level, every attempt at reform will remain a surface treatment for a much deeper fracture we are only beginning to name.","url":"https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/beings-in-yetzirah-ontological-politics-in-the-2028-election/","image":"https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/blogs/uploads/2026/01/ChatGPT-Image-Jan-24-2026-07_25_07-PM.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 08:21:00","author":"Matthew Robin","authors":["Matthew Robin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":0.156},{"id":395854636,"title":"Olson: Lessons from Maduro’s downfall remain","text":"The world is still processing the remarkable raid in Venezuela and its effect on the political front.\n\nU.S. Special Operations Forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from his residence on Jan. 3 and transported him to New York to face U.S. charges in a narco-terrorism conspiracy case.\n\nMaduro — a left-wing authoritarian who ruled Venezuela for more than a decade while ignoring election results — was not just another foreign dictator. He presided over the transformation of a once-wealthy nation into a failed narco-state, exporting drugs, migration instability, and criminal networks and gangs directly into the United States.\n\nA Harvard-Harris poll in December makes it unmistakably clear where the American people stand on Venezuela. Public opinion was closer to 80-20 than a partisan split, driven by concerns about drugs, crime and national security.\n\nVoters didn’t view Maduro as a legitimate democratic leader. Some 64% said he should be removed from office; 75% described his government as a dictatorship. When given fuller context — election fraud, narco-terrorism charges, the reward for capture, and the spillover of Venezuela’s collapse — support rose sharply: 85% said Maduro should be removed; 76% said the United States should arrest him.\n\nThe takeaway is straightforward: Americans see Venezuela as a narco-state problem with real consequences at home, and they broadly support decisive action to deal with it.\n\nThis public instinct didn’t emerge in a vacuum. As someone who tracks public opinion over time, one of the most striking patterns in modern polling is what happened in July 2021. President Joe Biden’s job approval collapsed at precisely the same moment Afghanistan collapsed — and it never meaningfully recovered.\n\nIn our polling after the horrific Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, Americans said they think Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Oct. 7 attacks were direct consequences of that collapse in Afghanistan. In the public mind, weakness invited aggression.\n\nWhat we’re seeing now — with the capture of Maduro and the strike on Iran’s nuclear program in Operation Midnight Hammer — is the Trump administration systematically repairing the damage to American power.\n\nWhere past administrations spent years bogged down in distant conflicts, this administration operates in hours.\n\nAnd the strategic effects ripple inward. The former border czar Kamala Harris famously said her job was to address the “root causes” of the migration crisis. After years of inaction, it took a new president to first close the border in a matter of weeks, and then actually confront a primary root cause: the collapse of Venezuela into a narco-terrorism state aligned with America’s greatest adversaries.\n\nFor Americans, this isn’t about empire or interventionism. It’s about restoring order, protecting lives, and reasserting the simple idea that American power, when used decisively and intelligently, still matters.\n\nDustin Olson is the managing partner of American Pulse Research & Polling and the founder of the political consulting firm Olson Strategies & Advertising/InsideSources","summary":"The world is still processing the remarkable raid in Venezuela and its effect on the political front.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2026/01/25/olson-lessons-from-maduros-downfall-remain/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/BHR-Z-OLSON-01.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 08:10:54","author":"Dustin Olson","authors":["Dustin Olson"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.16},{"id":395832968,"title":"Kamala Harris explodes after ICU nurse shot by ICE agents, calls Minneapolis a ‘murderous occupation’","text":"In a forceful social media outburst that quickly gained national attention, Kamala Harris, former US vice president and senior Democratic political figure, took to X (formerly Twitter) to condemn the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse shot dead by federal law enforcement officers in Minneapolis on January 24, 2026. Harris’s tweet crystallised widespread political and public outrage over the incident and intensified debate over federal law enforcement practices in US cities.Harris tweeted, “Alex Jeffrey Pretti was an ICU nurse at a VA hospital. His life, through his profession, was dedicated to serving his community and our country. As so many have now seen on video, his final act before he was killed by federal agents was doing everything in his power to protect his community.” Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a good neighbor until the very end.￼He was murdered for helping her. It’s sickening—you can clearly see here that he was just holding his phone. pic.twitter.com/PkO5dBRPy9— ᗰᗩƳᖇᗩ (@LePapillonBlu2) January 25, 2026 She went on to write, “Alex and tens of thousands of Minnesotans have boldly defended their neighbours against the murderous occupation of an American city by the federal government.” The message concluded with a forceful expression of personal and national grief: “I am enraged and heartbroken for Alex, his family, Minneapolis, and America.”Alex Jeffrey Pretti shooting that sparked the messageThe tweet came amid chaos in Minneapolis after federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, who worked at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System, during an operation that law enforcement described as immigration enforcement. Local and national reporting shows that federal agencies said Pretti approached officers with a handgun during the encounter, prompting a Border Patrol agent to fire.However, independent footage and eyewitness accounts have raised serious questions about that account. Videos shared widely on social media show Pretti holding a phone and attempting to assist a woman who had been pushed by an agent before he was pepper-sprayed, wrestled to the ground and then shot multiple times, raising confusion about what actually transpired in the moments before the fatal shot. Alex Jeffrey Pretti was an ICU nurse at a VA hospital. His life, through his profession, was dedicated to serving his community and our country. As so many have now seen on video, his final act before he was killed by federal agents was doing everything in his power to protect…— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 24, 2026 Harris’s statement is significant not just for its emotional weight but for how it frames the narrative of the incident. It humanises Pretti, emphasising his professional life as a caregiver and his dedication to community service, a stark contrast to official statements painting the episode as a violent confrontation.It taps into broader political discontent with federal enforcement approaches under the current US administration, particularly regarding immigration operations in cities such as Minneapolis. It amplifies public criticism, encouraging more scrutiny from media, activists and lawmakers who have already criticised federal tactics as overly aggressive or lacking transparency.The bluntness of Harris’s language, including phrases like “murderous occupation of an American city by the federal government”, highlights how polarised the political reaction has become. Critics of federal enforcement see the shooting as part of a pattern of excessive force against civilians, while supporters of the agents’ actions argue they were acting to protect themselves and enforce law.Political reaction beyond Kamala HarrisHarris’s remarks align with similar condemnations from Democratic officials across the US Following the shooting, lawmakers such as California Governor Gavin Newsom and national Democrats called for accountability and even structural changes to immigration enforcement practices. Some demanded congressional action to defund or restrict Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol operations amid public protests. The incident also prompted organised protests in Minneapolis, where demonstrators clashed with law enforcement and the Minnesota National Guard was activated to maintain order, a sign of how volatile the situation became in the immediate aftermath of Pretti’s death.Framing the incident: Kamala Harris and public sentimentHarris’s tweet serves not only as a political denunciation but also as a lens through which many Americans view the Pretti shooting, not just as a law-enforcement encounter but as a broader symptom of systemic governance issues. Many critics see federal enforcement actions in Minneapolis as emblematic of deeper problems:Use of force and civilian casualties during federal operations.Transparency concerns, with state officials reportedly denied access to investigate the scene.Messaging disputes between official agency accounts and independent video evidence suggesting different sequences of events.This narrative conflict, official justification vs public video and political critique, has made the incident a flashpoint in national discussions on law enforcement, civil liberties and executive authority. The dialogue sparked by Harris’s tweet has implications beyond Minneapolis. It feeds into larger national conversations about how US cities interact with federal law enforcement, especially when it comes to controversial policies like aggressive immigration enforcementSupporters of stronger immigration control argue federal agents are necessary to enforce law, while opponents see these actions as overreach that jeopardises community safety and civil rights. The polarised reactions highlight how a single high-profile incident can galvanise national political discourse, shaping narratives about government power, accountability and community protection.What’s nextThrough her tweet, Kamala Harris has ensured that Alex Pretti’s death remains not only a local tragedy but a symbol in national political debate, raising questions about citizen safety, federal power and how Americans expect government agents to interact with the people they are meant to protect.Several developments are unfolding. Investigations and legal scrutiny, Minnesota officials have pursued legal action to prevent federal authorities from destroying evidence related to the incident. Public protests and civic responses, Minneapolis has seen sustained public demonstrations calling for transparency and justice. Political mobilisation, Democrats and civil liberties advocates continue to use the case to argue for policy changes in federal law enforcement practices.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/former-us-vp-kamala-harris-explodes-after-icu-nurse-alex-jeffrey-pretti-shot-by-ice-agents-calls-minneapolis-a-murderous-occupation-in-furious-tweet/articleshow/127452326.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-127455996/127455996.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 06:28:00","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.096},{"id":395822334,"title":"Did Alex Pretti have a gun? Are ICE agents badly trained? Frequenly asked questions about Minneapolis shooting","text":"A few weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, Minneapolis was again rocked by the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti on January 24, 2026, during a federal immigration enforcement operation. Both deaths followed a grimly similar arc. Both involved fatal force used by immigration-linked federal agents against US citizens. Both were justified by official statements as responses to imminent danger. And in both cases, bystander videos and eyewitness accounts quickly complicated that narrative.In Good’s case, an ICE agent shot her while she sat in her vehicle. In Pretti’s, agents shot him at close range after a chaotic struggle on a snow-covered street. In each instance, federal officials described dangerous encounters. In each, video evidence suggested the victims were not posing an immediate threat at the moment they were killed. The shootings occurred within the same month, amid an intensified immigration crackdown that has already triggered protests, anger and a growing crisis of trust in the city.Who was Alex Pretti?Alex Pretti was a 37-year-old registered nurse at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System and a resident of south Minneapolis. Family members and colleagues described him as compassionate, civic-minded and deeply shaped by a career spent caring for critically ill patients. His father said Pretti was disturbed by the scale and tactics of federal immigration operations unfolding around him.Pretti had no serious criminal history beyond minor traffic violations. He was a lawful gun owner with a valid permit to carry. His family has rejected federal claims that he posed a violent threat, saying he was filming agents and attempting to help a woman during the encounter. They described early official portrayals of him as “sickening lies” and demanded transparency and accountability.Why was he there and what was he doing?Pretti was present during a large federal immigration enforcement action in Minneapolis, part of a broader deployment under Operation Metro Surge. Video footage shows him holding a phone and recording agents rather than behaving aggressively.During the encounter, a woman nearby was sprayed with a chemical agent. Pretti appears to step toward her to help, still holding his phone. Moments later, agents spray Pretti himself and then forcefully tackle him to the ground. That sequence — filming, moving to assist someone in distress, then being subdued — has been consistently described in eyewitness and video-based reporting.What do the videos show, minute by minute?A frame-by-frame analysis by The New York Times Visual Investigations team, based on multiple verified videos, reconstructs the final moments before Alex Pretti was killed and directly contradicts key elements of the federal account. Before physical contactThe videos show a small group of demonstrators standing in the street, speaking with a federal agent as whistles sound. Alex Pretti is visible among them, holding his phone and filming the scene, and at moments appears to be directing traffic around the protest area. No weapon is visible in his hands. Pepper spray is deployedAn agent begins pushing demonstrators and sprays pepper spray at their faces. At this moment, Pretti’s hands are clearly visible: one holding his phone, the other raised defensively to shield himself from the spray. Pretti moves to help another protesterAs others are sprayed, Pretti moves toward a woman who has just been hit with the chemical agent and appears to assist her. Agents approach him from behind as he does so. Agents seize and restrain himSeveral agents grab Pretti and pull him away. A struggle follows as they force him to his knees and then to the ground. The footage shows agents grabbing his legs, pushing down on his back, and striking him repeatedly while restraining him. An agent approaches with empty handsAs multiple agents pin Pretti to the ground, one agent is seen approaching the group with empty hands, reaching in as others hold Pretti down. His arms appear pinned near his head. Shouts about a gun — after he is pinnedAbout eight seconds after Pretti is already restrained, agents are heard shouting that he has a gun. The timing suggests, according to the Times’ analysis, that agents may not have realised he was armed until after he was on the ground. A gun is pulled from the struggleThe same agent who approached with empty hands pulls a handgun from within the cluster of bodies. The firearm appears to match the type that the Department of Homeland Security later said belonged to Pretti. At this point, Pretti remains pinned and under control. Shots fired at close rangeAs the gun emerges, another agent aims his weapon at Pretti’s back and appears to fire a shot at point-blank range. He continues firing as Pretti collapses. A third agent then unholsters a weapon, and both agents appear to fire additional shots into Pretti as he lies motionless. Duration and volume of fire The NYT analysis concludes that at least ten shots were fired within roughly five seconds.Family, colleagues and public reactionPretti’s family described him as someone whose professional life revolved around saving lives, not threatening them. They emphasised that he was filming and trying to help someone who had been sprayed when agents confronted him. Vigils and protests followed, reflecting a broader sense that Minneapolis was reliving a familiar and unresolved trauma. City and state leaders called for independent investigations and greater transparency.How many such incidents have happened recently?Pretti’s death was the third serious shooting involving federal immigration agents in Minneapolis within weeks. Earlier in January, an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good. Days later, another federal agent shot and wounded a Venezuelan man during the same enforcement surge. Together, the incidents have fuelled claims that the city has become a testing ground for aggressive federal tactics with little margin for error.What the federal government saysFederal officials have defended their personnel, framing Pretti’s killing as a defensive act during an attempt to disarm an armed individual. They have emphasised that he possessed a 9mm handgun and magazines and say agents acted to protect themselves. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem echoed that line, saying federal agents were operating in a “high-risk environment” and had responded to what they believed was an immediate threat. She warned against “second-guessing split-second decisions” made by officers on the ground and argued that criticism of the agents risked undermining immigration enforcement efforts nationwide. Critics counter that possession alone is not the issue. The central dispute is whether Pretti posed an imminent threat at the moment lethal force was used — something the videos, so far, do not clearly establish.Concerns about ICE training and tacticsConcerns about how Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are trained and deployed have sharpened in the wake of recent federal actions in Minneapolis, particularly after the fatal shootings of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti and the protests that followed. Critics point to several structural issues:Compressed training timelines: ICE academy instruction has reportedly been shortened significantly in recent years, from several months to a matter of weeks. Critics argue that this compression limits agents’ ability to develop judgment, threat assessment and de-escalation skills needed in fast-moving civilian encounters.Rapid hiring and deployment: Expanded enforcement has been accompanied by a hiring surge, raising concerns that agents are being deployed quickly into the field without sufficient experience, supervision or vetting, especially in dense urban settings.Limited de-escalation training: Legal experts and civil liberties groups say ICE agents receive far less training in de-escalation than local police departments, despite being placed in situations involving bystanders, protests and emotionally charged confrontations.Lack of crowd-control expertise: Federal immigration agents are not primarily trained for protest-adjacent or crowd-management scenarios, a gap that becomes visible when enforcement actions spill into public spaces with onlookers and demonstrators.Aggressive tactical posture: Video from Minneapolis has intensified criticism of tactics such as early and liberal use of chemical sprays, rapid escalation to physical force, and domination-style restraints, which critics argue can inflame situations rather than stabilise them.Urban mismatch: Local officials say ICE tactics often reflect a rural or border-zone enforcement mindset that does not translate well to large cities, where encounters unfold in full public view and require greater restraint and coordination.Accountability concerns: The repeated involvement of federal agents in fatal encounters has fuelled questions about oversight, use-of-force standards and whether immigration agents are subject to the same transparency expectations as local police.Taken together, these concerns suggest that the surge of federal immigration officers into Minneapolis, armed with compressed training and operating in a city already on edge, may be increasing the likelihood of deadly confrontations rather than preventing them.Political reactions The killing of Alex Pretti triggered a fierce political backlash. Kamala Harris said the videos were “heartbreaking” and that Pretti appeared to be “doing everything in his power to protect his community,” calling for a full and transparent investigation. Progressive Democrats sharpened their criticism. Ilhan Omar said the incident appeared to be “an execution by immigration enforcement,” while Elizabeth Warren called the shooting “horrific” and demanded accountability. Republicans rallied behind federal agents. Donald Trump defended the operation, saying “let ICE do their job,” and warned that criticism of enforcement would embolden criminals. Other Republicans echoed that view, stressing officer safety and law-and-order priorities.The divide was familiar but stark: Democrats focused on video evidence, restraint and accountability; Republicans on authority, enforcement and perceived threats.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-alex-pretti-have-a-gun-are-ice-agents-badly-trained-frequenly-asked-questions-about-minneapolis-shooting/articleshow/127450507.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-127451422/127451422.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 05:04:00","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.258},{"id":395817752,"title":"How Demented Do You Have To Be to Oppose Making America Healthy Again?","text":"I recently had a discussion with my wife about how healthy eggs are. We both agreed that they’re good for you – go eat some eggs – but my wife insisted that all the good stuff in them was in the yolk. As a kid, I remembered the recommendations being that you avoid the yolk and eat more of the whites. Then that changed, flipped actually, to the exact opposite, and now we’re to the point that it’s recommended that you just eat the whole thing. I don’t tell you this to start a debate about eggs, but a discussion about food and health, because everything has pretty much changed over the course of my life and then back again, but now it seems to make some sense.\n\nThe reason people were told to avoid egg yolks was cholesterol – the yolks have quite a bit of it, the white have none of it. And we were told cholesterol was bad for you, would kill you, in fact. Then came the idea that the cholesterol you eat doesn’t have all that much to do with the cholesterol in your blood…etc. \n\nIn other words, things changed. Not just a little, but completely. \n\nThis isn’t the only thing that has changed, to one degree or another pretty much everything has changed over time. Don’t eat butter, it’s bad for you – eat margarine because reasons. Sugar is bad, eat these chemicals blended together to taste like sugar, that’s better! Avoid fat in steaks, eat lean because eating fat makes you fat.\n\nIf you’ve been paying attention, pretty much everything we consume (aside from simply, unambiguous junk food) has been praised and condemned at some point. All of it by the government.\n\nI still remember as a kid eating something like Captain Crunch with the picture on the side of the box that said something like, “Part of this balanced breakfast.” What was the picture of? A bowl of mouth-slicing Captain Crunch, eggs, waffles or pancakes, bacon and/or sausage, a glass of milk and a glass of orange juice. I remember wondering who the hell has that much for breakfast? \n\nNo wonder we got fat as a nation.\n\nThe government was suggesting more servings of bread than a sandwich factory would churn out, made with ingredients stripped of their nutritional value to elongate shelf life. It was crazy. The food pyramid seemed designed by the Diabetes Industrial Complex. \n\nNow, thanks to Robert Kennedy Jr., Secretary of Health and Human Services, the pyramid has been flipped to include things that make sense; things like “eat more natural foods with less fake garbage stuffed in them.”\n\nHow is this controversial? Who gets upset over the concept of making America healthy again? Is there anyone arguing that an obesity rate above 40 percent is a good thing? How riddled by Trump Derangement Syndrome does your brain have to be to argue against common sense in the best interest of everyone?\n\n“Eat what you want, but you should try to avoid things that only exist because machines and chemicals churned them out” isn’t partisan or crazy. You’d think people trying to ban plastic and paper bags “for the environment” wouldn’t freak out over someone suggesting you’ll be better off without dyes and artificial flavors dominating your diet.\n\nBut leftists freak out about everything, it’s their go-to move on all issues these days. \n\nThe new guidelines for alcohol consumption has the party of Kamala “Box of Wine” Harris clutching their pearls. The party that doesn’t know what a woman is now finds itself upset over the differences for suggestions of alcohol consumption between men and women removed, creating one common sense standard of “don’t drink like camel” (fish don’t actually drink that much) and be responsible. \n\nIt shouldn’t be controversial to advise people to “limit” consumption on a regular basis, but also recognize that drinking alcohol is both fun and leads to meeting future spouses more often than any of us would ever like to eventually admit to our children. Life happens, a couple of beers now and then makes it more enjoyable. \n\nResponsible adults don’t need government to tell them what to eat or drink – we do not need a nanny government, just some common sense guidelines actually based on science and not whims or lobbying by various parts of industries (which is how we ended up with that old food pyramid in the first place) or controlling AWFULs tisk-tisking if we choose to spend our Friday nights with friends and some adult beverages. \n\nMAHA is a major component of Making America Sane Again. Unfortunately, far too many Americans will prove to be immune to it. But don’t let that stop you from enjoying a big, juicy steak and cold beer. Let everyone else be miserable. \n\nDerek Hunter is the host of the Derek Hunter Show on WMAL in Washington, DC, and has a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses, and host of the weekly “Week in F*cking Review” podcast where the news is spoken about the way it deserves to be.

The man has been identified as Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old US citizen, intensive care unit (ICU) nurse and Veterans Affairs employee, whose family and colleagues say was deeply committed to serving people and standing up for his community.Watch | \"What Did You Do?\" Videos Show Chilling Moments During Minneapolis ShootingPersonal Life Pretti was born in Illinois and grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin. He attended Preble High School, where he played football and baseball and ran track. He was a Boy Scout and also sang in the Green Bay Boy Choir.After graduating from high school, Pretti went on to study at the University of Minnesota. He graduated in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in biology, society and the environment, according to his family. He initially worked as a research scientist before returning to school to become a registered nurse.At the time of his death, Pretti worked as an ICU nurse for the Veterans Health Administration at the Minneapolis VA hospital. Public records show he earned $90,783 in 2023. On LinkedIn, the University of Minnesota alumnus most recently described himself as a \"junior scientist.\"\"I worked with him daily for years at the VA hospital,\" Ruth Anway, a Minneapolis-based nurse, told the Daily Mail. \"He was an ICU nurse. He worked with veterans. He was a really good guy. He definitely did not deserve to get killed.\"Pretti was described by those close to him as an avid outdoorsman who loved adventure. He was also a competitive bicycle racer and took great pride in caring for his Audi.He was deeply attached to his dog, Joule, a Catahoula Leopard dog, who had died about a year ago. Family members said the loss of his dog had affected him deeply.Joined Immigration Protests Despite Family's WarningsPretti had participated in protests following the January 7 killing of Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman who was shot when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fired into her vehicle.\"He cared about people deeply and he was very upset with what was happening in Minneapolis and throughout the United States with ICE, as millions of other people are upset,\" said his father, Michael Pretti. Read | 'He Was A Nurse, Treated Sick Veterans': Family On Minneapolis Immigration Killing\"He thought it was terrible, you know, kidnapping children, just grabbing people off the street. He cared about those people, and he knew it was wrong, so he did participate in protests,\" his father told AP.His parents, who live in Colorado, said they had recently spoken to their son about being cautious while protesting.\"We had this discussion with him two weeks ago or so, you know, that go ahead and protest, but do not engage, do not do anything stupid, basically,\" Michael Pretti said. \"And he said he knows that. He knew that.\"No Criminal Record, Lawful Gun OwnershipCourt records show that Pretti had no criminal history. His family said he had never had any interaction with law enforcement apart from a few traffic tickets.Family members confirmed that Pretti owned a handgun and had a permit to carry a concealed handgun in Minnesota, but said they had never known him to carry it.His ex-wife, who spoke to the AP but later requested anonymity, said she was not surprised he would take part in protests against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. She said they had not spoken since their divorce more than two years ago, after she moved to another state.She described Pretti as a Democratic voter who had also joined protests following the 2020 killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. She said he might shout at law enforcement officers during protests but had never been physically confrontational.She added that Pretti had obtained a permit to carry a concealed firearm about three years earlier and owned at least one semiautomatic handgun when they separated.Family Rejects Official ClaimsAfter seeing videos of senior Trump administration officials describing their son as a \"domestic terrorist,\" Pretti's family released a written statement expressing grief and anger.\"The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,\" the statement said, AP reported.The family said videos showed that Pretti was not holding a gun when federal agents tackled him, but was holding his phone in one hand and using the other to shield a woman who was being pepper-sprayed.\"Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man,\" they said.Former Vice President Kamala Harris reacted to the shooting in a post on X, saying she was \"enraged and heartbroken.\"She wrote, \"Alex Jeffrey Pretti was an ICU nurse at a VA hospital.

What we know","text":"The morning after tens of thousands marched through downtown Minneapolis against a federal immigration crackdown, agents fatally shot a U.S. citizen on Jan. 24.\n\nHere's what we know\n\nWho was shot and killed in Minneapolis? Who is Alex Pretti?\n\nThe victim is 37‑year‑old Alex Jeffrey Pretti of Minneapolis, a registered nurse who worked in the intensive care unit for the Veterans Administration. Pretti graduated in 2006 from Green Bay Preble High School where he was an honor roll student, competed in state solo and ensemble and was part of the cast in the Preble Players comedy play \"Radio Daze\" in May 2006.\n\nWhat caused the shooting?\n\nAround 9 a.m. Jan. 24, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was conducting an immigration enforcement operation in in the area of 26th Street West and Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis.\n\nThe federal department said a Border Patrol officer resorted to fatally shooting Pretti after he approached agents with a handgun and they attempted to disarm him, USA Today reported.\n\nHowever, multiple videos captured by people at the scene tell a different story.\n\nVideo doesn't show Pretti holding a gun in his hands. After an agent shoves a person, Pretti stands between the person and agents. Agents then spray a substance at their faces. About eight agents wrestle Pretti to the ground. An agent then shoots Pretti several times, USA Today reported.\n\nThe federal department says Pretti had a handgun and two magazines. Pretti owned a firearm and has a permit to carry a firearm. He didn't have a criminal record.\n\nReaction to the shooting of Pretti\n\nU.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and DHS are \"out of control.\"\n\n\"I will not support funding for DHS without clear accountability and stronger controls over the agency,\" Baldwin said in a Jan. 24 post on X. \"It is time for the Senate to do its job and rein in this lawlessness.\"\n\nGov. Tony Evers kept it simple, showing support for Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a fellow Democrat\n\n\"Wisconsin stands with Minnesota,\" he said on X Jan. 24, replying to a post by Walz calling for the end of the Immigration Customs and Enforcement action in Minneapolis.\n\nGreen Bay Mayor Eric Genrich and Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson denounced agents' fatal shooting of Pretti in statements hours after he was identified.\n\nPeggy Wirtz-Olsen, a Wisconsin teacher and president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, said Pretti was selfless and cared deeply for his community.\n\n\"Educators across Wisconsin stand with Alex Pretti’s family, former classmates and the Green Bay and Minneapolis communities in grief. ... The long-lasting damage caused by ICE violence will reverberate in Minnesota, Wisconsin and across America for years to come,\" Wirtz-Olsen said in a statement Jan. 24.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris called Pretti dedicated to serving his community. \"As so many have now seen on video, his final act before he was killed by federal agents was doing everything in his power to protect his community.\"\n\nDr. Aasma Shaukat, a professor at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, described Pretti as the \"kindest, sweetest human.\" He was one of her research assistants, she said in a Jan. 24 post on X.\n\n\"May his soul rest in peace and this senseless carnage stop,\" Shaukat said.\n\nThe shock of Pretti's death goes beyond the Midwest. Zach Lambert, a pastor in Austin, Texas, says he hopes his two sons grow up to be like Pretti.\n\n\"He lived helping people in need and died helping people in need,\" Lambert said.\n\nProtests in wake of fatal shooting\n\nAngelito Tenorio, a former West Allis alderperson, encouraged people to join him in a protest against ICE.\n\n\"We demand that ICE stop terrorizing our cities and get out of our communities,\" Tenorio said in a Facebook post Jan. 24.\n\nThe protest is scheduled for 2 pm Jan. 25 at West Allis City Hall Centennial Plaza.\n\nIn response to Pretti's death, Green Bay Anti-War called an \"emergency protest\" at 2 p.m. Jan. 25 at the CityDeck in downtown Green Bay, saying, \"We will not stand by while our neighbors in Minneapolis are being terrorized.\"\n\nMeanwhile, protesters gathered Jan. 24 in Milwaukee's Red Arrow Park after learning of the fatal shooting by federal law enforcement in Minneapolis.\n\nGina Castro is a Public Investigator reporter.

Ayanna Pressley, who told reporters afterward that, “I’m just focused on survivors. We want to hear from anyone who has information. And that should not be limited to party lines.”\n\nThe vote came after months of pressure by the House Oversight Committee for the testimony. \n\nLawyer letters, demands and promises came and went as the Clintons demanded that they be allowed to submit written statements instead of giving testimony under oath.\n\nBut as Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the GOP chairman of the committee, put it, “Subpoenas are not mere suggestions.”\n\nThe full House is now gearing up for a contempt vote, and passage would send a criminal referral to the Justice Department calling for prosecution of the Clintons.\n\nDigging up dirt\n\nThat same process led to the prosecution of two Trump associates, Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, under Joe Biden.\n\nBoth were convicted and served four months in prison for refusing to testify about their knowledge of events surrounding the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\nIn another hopeful sign, the party-crossing Dems have all lived to tell about it. \n\nSo far, there is no Dem outcry that they are traitors, nor is there any talk about finding and funding primary candidates against them this year.\n\nStill, there is another aspect to consider, and that’s where the good news turns sour. \n\nIt’s that the Clinton vote is just the latest sign that both Democrats and Republicans remain demonically possessed with exploring every jot and tittle of the disgusting life of a convicted criminal who committed suicide in prison in 2019.\n\nIt’s also hard to escape the sense that all hold motives devoid of self interest.\n\nRather, I believe politics is the ultimate driver of the relentless passion over Epstein, with both sides holding out hope that proof exists somewhere that will give them a kill shot to use against their opponents.Consider that last November, by wide margins in both chambers, Congress passed the “Epstein Transparency Act” that required Attorney General Pam Bondi to release “all documents and records” held by the Justice Department that relate to Epstein.\n\nShe was given just a month, or by last Dec. 19, to put virtually every document in a searchable data base for public consumption.\n\nThe act also covered Maxwell and included flight logs, travel records, customs and immigration documents for any aircraft, boat or vehicle “owned or used by Epstein.”\n\nAll internal Justice Department documents, including memos, were included.\n\nIn an extraordinary statement that belies the political overtones, the law specified that with the exception of identifying victims, “No record shall be withheld, delayed, or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.”\n\nA major factor, of course, is that President Trump had a long relationship with Epstein, a fact Trump has admitted. \n\nPhotos show them together at Mar-a-Lago and elsewhere over the years, though there is no charge that Trump acted inappropriately with any Epstein victims.\n\nFanning the flames\n\nAlthough some Dems hoped the transparency act would nail Trump, the president supported it and even took credit for passage after it sailed through both chambers.\n\nWith some 75% of the public supporting the bill, the measure united Congress. \n\nThere was only one “no” vote in the House, and Senate passage was unanimous.\n\nBut in an odd twist, the release of the documents is partially fanning the flames of partisanship.\n\nThat’s largely because the documents are so voluminous that they have swamped the Justice Department and led to suspicions about the release timetable.\n\nAn AP report in December claimed the agency was holding an estimated 5.2 million covered documents and had assigned some 400 lawyers to reviewing them for quick release.\n\nRecently, Justice said it has released 125,000 pages of documents, but critics, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, bitterly complain that the deadline required release of all documents.\n\n“What are they trying to hide,” Schumer fumed as he accused the administration of violating the transparency act.\n\nBondi responded by writing that “There are more than two million documents potentially responsive to the Act that are in various phases of review” and that protecting victims also slowed the process.\n\nThere you have it. \n\nBipartisanship was fun while it lasted.","summary":"For those Americans longing for an end to the hyperpartisan gridlock in Washington, there’s finally

The FPPC explains on its website that a behested payment is not a gift or a campaign contribution, but a payment made “at the request, suggestion, or solicitation of, or made in cooperation, consultation, coordination, or concert with the public official.”\n\nThat explanation can be shortened to just one word: “shakedown.”\n\nUnlike donations to a campaign committee or PAC, behested payments have no contribution limit. The only limitation is that the payments must be for a “legislative, governmental or charitable purpose.” Payments totaling $5,000 or more in a calendar year from a single source must be reported within 30 days.\n\nBehested payments have funded the California State Protocol Foundation. In 2025, Newsom “behested” a payment of $220,000 from the University of California Berkeley for the “charitable” purpose of paying the costs of attending the Vatican climate summit. He “behested” the U.S. Energy Foundation out of $150,000 to pay for his “delegation” to the COP30 climate change conference in Brazil, also described as a “charitable” purpose.\n\nNewsom hit up Zoox, Inc., an autonomous vehicle subsidiary of Amazon, and Centene Management Company, LLC, of St. Louis, “a leading provider of government-sponsored healthcare,” for $25,000 each “in support of general operations” of the Protocol Foundation.\n\nBut the largest behested payments came from Newsom’s own inaugural committees. The “2023 Governor’s Inaugural Fund” paid the California State Protocol Foundation a total of $2 million in 2023 and 2024. The “Governor’s Inaugural Fund 2019” paid $700,000 in April 2019 and $2,436,317 in May 2020.\n\nThe reports of behested payments to the inaugural committees reveal who was on the receiving end of a “request, suggestion or solicitation” from the newly elected or re-elected governor.\n\nEverybody. Indian tribes, apartment associations, beverage companies, health care and hospital companies, the carpenters’ union, the nurses’ union, the teachers’ union, the firefighters’ union, the prison guards’ union, AT&T, Amazon, Uber, the service employees, the electrical workers, the pipe trades council, the building industry association, the operating engineers, the professional engineers, the charter schools, the aircraft manufacturers and many, many more.\n\nAbout $5.1 million of the roughly $8.8 million that Newsom asked special interests to pay for the “governmental” purpose of inaugural events ended up transferred to the Protocol Foundation, where it is used to prop up the governor on the world stage as he emotes for cameras about climate change and complains that not enough has been done to stop Donald Trump.\n\nNot enough? Jack Smith, Letitia James, Alvin Bragg, Fani Willis, Hillary Clinton, the January 6th Committee, two sets of impeachment prosecutors and whoever allowed that sniper on the roof in Butler must be wondering what it takes to impress Gavin Newsom.\n\nDemocratic political analyst and former Obama advisor David Axelrod wrote in an online post that he was finding Newsom’s “’Why can’t people just be as courageous as ME?’ routine” to be “tedious.”\n\nIt was certainly predictable. Before Newsom left California for Davos, his office was telling reporters that he would present California as an alternative to the Trump administration, “a beacon of stability and loyalty.”\n\nWhat does that even mean? Are we going to defend Europe with $6 billion in carbon credits and a third of a bullet train?\n\nWhen he got off the plane in Davos, Newsom was a regular insult comic. He told reporters that U.S. allies were “pathetic” for not standing up to Trump. He said the president “is a T-rex – you mate with him or he devours you.” He waved around knee pads to show contempt for leaders he views as being on their knees to Trump.\n\nAsked about Newsom’s criticisms, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent went full Don Rickles. Opening with, “Governor Newsom, who strikes me as Patrick Bateman meets Sparkle Beach Ken,” Bessent went on to roast Newsom as “the only Californian who knows less about economics than Kamala Harris.” He got in a dig about Newsom’s “billionaire sugar daddy, Alex Soros” and worked in the “$1,000-a-night meals at the French Laundry” during the COVID lockdown.\n\nRickles might have paid a lot for that “American Psycho” meets “Barbie” joke. But Bessent was probably not joking when he said this: “My message to Governor Newsom is the Trump administration is coming to California. We are going to crack down on waste, fraud and abuse.”\n\nNewsom had been scheduled to speak at an event connected to the World Economic Forum, but somehow he was canceled, missing out on a high-profile opportunity to claim that his state is leading the world on climate change.\n\nIf Newsom had dreams of flying to Davos and being praised by world leaders as an alternative to Trump who is both superior and inevitable, the Trump team acidly crushed them. “No one in Davos knows who third-rate governor Newscum is or why he is frolicking around Switzerland instead of fixing the many problems he created in California,” a White House spokesperson said.\n\nBut all is not lost for the governor. He still has enough juice in California to get a free trip.\n\nWrite Susan@SusanShelley.com and follow her on X @Susan_Shelley","summary":"Susan Shelley- Gavin Newsom grandstands and flops at Davos","url":"https://www.presstelegram.com/2026/01/24/susan-shelley-gavin-newsom-grandstands-and-flops-at-davos/","image":"https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26022297037535.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 00:07:34","author":"Gqlshare","authors":["Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":396037856,"title":"Over 20 Jewish graves desecrated in Barcelona cemetery","text":"Skip to main content\n\n Toggle Menu\n\nJoin our Community\n\nSupport ToI and remove all ads\n\n Learn more\n\nGet The Daily Edition\n\n Account\n\n Sign In\n\n \n\nISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 843 \n\n Open Search form\n\n Input search\n\nClear search input\n\nIsrael & the Region\n\nJewish Times\n\nIsrael Inside\n\nTech Israel\n\nReal Estate Israel\n\nNewsletters\n\nThe Daily Edition\nWhat Matters Most Today\n\nTech Israel\nUpdates from Silicon Wadi\n\nReal Estate Israel\nMonthly Update\n\nThe Weekend Edition\nThe Best Reads of the Week\n\nWeekly Highlights\nChoice Voices From The Blogs\n\nAtlanta Jewish Times\n\nNorth New Jersey\nThe Jewish Standard\n\nJewish Chronicle\n\nUnited Kingdom\nThe Jewish News\n\nThe Australian Jewish News\n\nFor Publishers\nBecome a Partner \n\nJoin our community\n\nAbout The Times of Israel\n\nAdvertise on The Times of Israel\n\nGet the Daily Edition\n\n© 2026 The Times of Israel , All Rights Reserved\n\nTerms and conditions\nPrivacy policy\n\n Open Search form\n\n Input search\n\nClear search input\n\n \n\nAdvertisement\n\nMayor says authorities working to identify culprits\n\nOver 20 Jewish graves desecrated in Barcelona cemetery\n\nCommunity spokesperson links attack to map published by anti-Israel activists marking Jewish, Israeli sites, denounces ‘despicable antisemitic act’ \n\n \n\n By AFP and ToI Staff\n\n 26 January 2026, 1:04 am\n\n Edit\n\n \n\n \n\nSend by email\n\n \n\n \n \n\nA general view of Barcelona, Spain, on July 7, 2015. (Nati Shohat/Flash90)\n\nMADRID, Spain — Vandals desecrated a number of Jewish graves in a Barcelona cemetery this weekend, Spanish police said Sunday, provoking outrage from Jewish groups and politicians.\n\nSpain’s Jewish community reported Saturday’s incident in the Jewish section of Les Corts graveyard in Barcelona.\n\n“We are aware of the incident and have opened an investigation,” a Catalan police spokesperson told AFP, without specifying how many graves had been defaced.\n\nBut a spokesperson for Spain’s Federation of Jewish Communities (FCJE) told AFP that more than 20 graves had been desecrated.\n\nIn a statement, the FCJE condemned the “despicable antisemitic act,” calling on the authorities to “show the utmost resolve in confronting antisemitism.”\n\n Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\n by email and never miss our top stories\n\n Newsletter email address\n\n By signing up, you agree to the terms\n\nIt linked the incident to a map — created by pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel activists and since removed from the internet — that marks Jewish or Israeli-linked places and businesses in Barcelona.\n\n????

(YouTube)\n\nA US entertainment company apologized on Saturday for canceling a show by Israeli comedian Guy Hochman due to pressure from anti-Zionist activist groups.\n\nHochman’s tour of North America has been plagued by harassment, reflecting pressure on Jewish and Israeli performers in the US.\n\nThe Fine Arts Theater in Beverly Hills, California, had announced that Hochman’s Saturday show was canceled in a statement posted to the theater’s social media.\n\nThe statement said that the entertainment company managing the show, the Screening Services Group, had received complaints about Hochman, but that the company could not “find any proof of the accusations.”\n\nThe company asked Hochman to make public statements saying that he did not “support the genocide, rape, starvation and torture of Palestinian civilians,” though, the statement said.\n\n Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\n by email and never miss our top stories\n\n Newsletter email address\n\n By signing up, you agree to the terms\n\nHochman refused and was banned from the facility, the statement said, adding that the company “is not political and does not ask the political beliefs” of its renters and that “we don’t support genocide.”\n\n A screenshot from a mock video tour of a damaged hotel in Gaza created by Israeli comedian Guy Hochman on January 6, 2024. (Used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)\n\nAfter the statement was released, the Israeli-American Council (IAC) and Jewish community members contacted the company.\n\n“You conditioned his ability to perform on his willingness to issue a public political declaration disavowing alleged atrocities — accusations that are routinely used to demonize Israelis collectively,” the IAC said in a letter to Michael Hall of the Screening Services Group and the theater.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe demands were antisemitic under the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, which Beverly Hills adopted in 2020, the letter said.\n\n“Requiring an Israeli individual to publicly deny blood libels or adopt a prescribed political narrative — absent evidence, conduct, or speech supporting such accusations — constitutes compelled political speech and identity-based discrimination. Treating refusal or silence as guilt is not neutrality. It is collective punishment,” the letter said.\n\nThe IAC requested a public apology, a clarification that the theater does not impose loyalty tests based on nationality, and a commitment that the theater will adhere to the IHRA definition of antisemitism.\n\nLater Saturday, the theater released another statement signed by Hall that apologized for the decision.\n\n“I want to apologize, especially to the Jewish community, for my statement and for how this situation was handled. I understand that my decision caused harm and distress,” Hall said.\n\nHe added that, ahead of the event, he and the theater were inundated with messages, including “threats of violence,” causing him to cancel the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It was wrong to ask any artist to make political or ideological statements as a condition of appearing. Imposing a litmus test of any kind was a mistake,” he said.\n\nבזמן שישנתם חיכתה לי הפגנה פרו פלסטינית מחוץ להופעה שלי בטורונטו. אחד המטורללים בא לתקוף אותי ועומר הגן עליי ונפצע. התוקף נעצר על ידי המשטרה המקומית. עומר בסדר גמור. ממשיך לעדכן. אנחנו לא מוותרים ???????? pic.twitter.com/rd1cpbJ1ij\n\n— גיא הוכמן (@HochmanGuy) January 20, 2026\n\nHochman’s tour of North America has been plagued by controversies due to a campaign by anti-Zionist activist groups that shared videos of Hochman joking about the war in Gaza and staged protests against him.\n\nThe campaign is led by the Hind Rajab Foundation, a group based in Belgium that targets Israelis who are traveling abroad, accusing them of war crimes. The accusations are based on the Israelis’ participation in the war in Gaza and do not include evidence of individual misconduct.\n\nLast week, Hochman was held at the Toronto airport for six hours for questioning after the Hind Rajab Foundation, an anti-Zionist legal activist group, said it had filed a complaint against him with Canadian authorities. The complaint shared by the foundation accused Hochman of “incitement to genocide” due to statements calling for “revenge” in Gaza and his support for the IDF.\n\nThe head of the foundation, Dyad Abou Jahjah, is a former member of the Hezbollah terrorist group who backed the September 11, 2001, attack on the US and the October 2023 Hamas invasion of Israel, and eulogized the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, among other statements in support of terror groups, according to the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nDays after arriving in Toronto, in New York City, a venue canceled Hochman’s show after protests from anti-Zionist groups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHochman is scheduled to perform at a synagogue in Saratoga, California, on Sunday night. Anti-Zionist activists released the synagogue’s phone number, asking their followers to bombard the synagogue with phone calls demanding it cancel the show. The activists released a script for the calls, instructing followers to tell the synagogue that Hochman is a “war criminal” and a “mouthpiece for Israel’s genocidal slaughter.”\n\nHochman told The Hollywood Reporter on Saturday that he rejected the theater’s demands because “I will never say lies about my people.”\n\n“I’m not a politician. I’m a comedian. A very Zionist comedian,” he said. “I am not giving up and I’m not giving in. I will not give them the pleasure, but I am getting a lot of threats on my life.”\n\nIsraeli and Jewish entertainers have repeatedly been targeted by protests since the start of the Gaza war, prompting many organizers to keep details about their events secret and vet attendees.\n\nJerry Seinfeld, who is Jewish, has been repeatedly targeted, for example, including in recent weeks, with activists deriding him as a “Zionist” and a “genocide apologist.”\n\n Is accurate Israel coverage important to you? \n\n \n\nIf so, we have a request. \n\nEvery day during the past two years of war and rising global anti-Zionism and antisemitism, our journalists kept you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Rinat Saban arrives at the Jerusalem District Court for a hearing on National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir's refusal to sign off on her promotion on January 25, 2026. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\n\nSupt. Rinat Saban, a police detective whose promotion has been blocked by National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir after she testified against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, spoke out for the first time Sunday, accusing the politician of threatening officers for fulfilling their duty.\n\nBen Gvir has for months, against the counsel of senior police brass, been preventing the advancement of Saban, who helped investigate and later testified in Netanyahu’s corruption trial.\n\nThe far-right minister and Saban arrived at the Jerusalem District Court for a first hearing on her promotion to the rank of chief superintendent on Sunday morning.\n\n“For an entire year I did not speak because it’s forbidden for an officer to comment, but it is important for me to speak,” Saban said, according to Walla. “It’s unbelievable that I have to stand here in court and explain why I should be promoted.”\n\nShe then turned to Ben Gvir in the courtroom and asked him: “Is there a threat here, minister?” accusing him of conveying a message to officers that they will pay a professional price for being involved with certain cases.\n\n Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\n by email and never miss our top stories\n\n Newsletter email address\n\n By signing up, you agree to the terms\n\n“This is a heavy personal price that I am paying here,” she said, according to the outlet.\n\nBefore the hearing began, Ben Gvir spoke to the press and accused Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, who has demanded several times that the minister sign off on Saban’s promotion, of behaving like a member of a criminal gang.\n\n National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir appears at the Jerusalem District Court for a hearing on attempts to block the promotion of Supt. Rinat Saban on January 25, 2026. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\n\n“What you are seeing is behavior that is very much like that of a mafia… they are threatening me that if I don’t promote this officer, they’ll fire me,” he said, referring to the Attorney General’s Office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTraditionally, the minister responsible for police signs off on officers’ promotions in rank. However, the signature was seen as little more than a formality until Ben Gvir was appointed.\n\nPolice chief Danny Levy has been seeking to promote the superintendent and argued in a November court filing that Ben Gvir’s refusal to give the final signature “could sow fear among police officers who testify in criminal investigations.”\n\nBen Gvir signed off on Saban’s promotion in December 2024 conditional on her completing the police command and staff course. She finished the course in April 2025, a month after testifying against Netanyahu in court. Then, in a reversal, he blocked the promotion.\n\nLevy requested that the court grant him permission to go over Ben Gvir’s head and promote Saban should the ultranationalist minister refuse a potential court order to promote her.\n\nSaban testified against Netanyahu in March and previously investigated his advisers Jonatan Urich and Ofer Golan on suspicion of harassing Shlomo Filber, a state witness in Case 4000, the most serious of the three cases in the premier’s ongoing corruption trial.\n\nIn July, Baharav-Miara accused Ben Gvir of factoring political considerations into his decision to block Saban’s promotion, calling his behavior “highly unusual and unprecedented compared to past police promotions.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe warned in a letter to the far-right minister that his behavior was “not just inappropriate but also an abuse of power,” and demanded that he immediately sign off on Saban’s promotion, as his signature was meant to be a formality and was not intended to grant him actual power over the promotion process.\n\n L: National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir (Chaim Goldberg/Flash90); R: Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara (Oren Ben Hakoon/Pool)\n\nThe High Court of Justice is deliberating on petitions that demand Netanyahu fire Ben Gvir as national security minister.\n\nBaharav-Miara has backed this demand, and at the beginning of January urged the court to force the premier “to explain why he is not removing National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir from his position.”\n\n Is accurate Israel coverage important to you? \n\n \n\nIf so, we have a request. \n\nEvery day during the past two years of war and rising global anti-Zionism and antisemitism, our journalists kept you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

(Itay Dodi, Water Authority)\n\nThe Water Authority announced Sunday that the Soreq B desalination plant in the center of the country has entered full operation and will henceforth produce 200 million cubic meters of water annually.\n\nThe facility, located in Rishon Lezion, began operating about a year ago at 60 percent capacity.\n\nIsrael will require approximately 2.3 billion cubic meters of water (potable and otherwise) during the hydrological year, which began in October, when rainfall typically starts.\n\nIn addition to 20 million cubic meters to be pumped from the Sea of Galilee, six desalination stations, including Soreq B at full capacity, will supply around 800 million cubic meters of water — thus meeting 70% to 80% of the country’s potable water needs).\n\nA seventh station, located in the Western Galilee, is planned to come online in 2027 and provide an additional 100 million cubic meters.\n\n Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\n by email and never miss our top stories\n\n Newsletter email address\n\n By signing up, you agree to the terms\n\nA further 700 million cubic meters will come from recycled sewage water and brackish water, used mainly for agriculture, according to the Water Authority, bringing the total of “manufactured” water up to 1.5 billion cubic meters.\n\nTo make up the shortfall, additional water will be pumped from subterranean aquifers or taken from reservoirs, built to trap floodwaters, in the north and south.\n\nAmos Porat, director of Climate Services at the Israel Meteorological Service (IMS), told The Times of Israel that nationwide, around 350 millimeters (13.77 inches) of rain have fallen this winter, which is 118 percent of the average for the period, and 66% of the average for the entire year. Around the Sea of Galilee, 200 to 220 millimeters (7.87 to 9.84 inches) have fallen, or 80% to 90% of the average for the same period and 40% to 50% of the average for the entire year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n Is accurate Israel coverage important to you? \n\n \n\nIf so, we have a request. \n\nEvery day during the past two years of war and rising global anti-Zionism and antisemitism, our journalists kept you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Gov. Janet Mills (D), who announced her run for the Senate in October, called for withholding ICE’s funding until it changes its tactics. Mills’s primary opponent, oyster farmer Graham Platner, said he would join protesters in the streets and called for Mills to direct Maine law enforcement to follow ICE agents.\n\nTheir initial reactions signal how they plan to position themselves more broadly in a closely watched primary and an even more closely watched general election.\n\nICE launched its Catch of the Day operation in Maine on Wednesday as it continued a sustained presence in Minnesota that has drawn fierce protests, litigation and, on Friday, a general strike. An ICE agent this month fatally shot Renée Good, 37, in her vehicle in a residential neighborhood in Minneapolis, and many Democrats in Maine have called for resisting ICE in their state.\n\nImmigration was a strength for Trump in his 2024 campaign, but recent polls show voters oppose ICE’s recent activities. In a CBS News survey, 61 percent of Americans said ICE was too tough when it detained people. A Quinnipiac University poll found 57 percent of registered voters disapproved of how ICE was enforcing immigration laws and 53 percent believed Good’s shooting was unjustified.\n\nCollins is the only GOP senator to represent a state that Democratic nominee Kamala Harris won in 2024. She has a long record of appealing to Democrats and independents in addition to Republicans, and she’ll need to do that again to win a sixth term.\n\nCollins did not agree to an interview or answer questions from The Washington Post. In a statement on her website, Collins neither praised nor criticized ICE’s operations in Maine. People in the United States illegally who commit crimes should be deported, she said. Immigrants who are in the country legally should not be targeted by ICE and should seek assistance through advocacy networks if they are improperly detained, Collins said.\n\nCollins called for equipping ICE agents with body cameras and giving them de-escalation training. “At this time of heightened tensions, these steps could help improve trust, accountability, and safety,” she said in the statement.\n\nMills, in an interview, called on Congress to hold up funding for ICE until it changes its tactics. As the Senate Appropriations Committee chair, Collins should be leading that effort, Mills said.\n\n“How on earth does she let him - Trump - weaponize this agency to instill terror and fear?” Mills said of Collins.\n\nMills said she has been talking to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) and monitoring the lawsuit that officials in his state filed against ICE. She said Trump has “weaponized ICE” but it’s too soon to say if she would sue over its activities in her state.\n\nMills attended a fundraiser in San Francisco the day the Trump administration launched its operations in Maine. The event did not hamper her ability to respond to ICE, she said. She has been in steady contact with law enforcement at all levels, she said, and last week warned the public that ICE could ramp up enforcement.\n\nThe Trump administration, in announcing its increased enforcement in Maine this week, singled out Mills for criticism. “Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,” Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.\n\nAs governor, Mills last month said she was allowing a law to take effect without her signature that will limit how local and state law enforcement work with immigration authorities. She expressed some reservations about the measure but said she supported it in the face of “horrifying actions” by ICE. She also rescinded a policy by a Republican predecessor that required state law enforcement to provide enhanced cooperation with federal officials on immigration.\n\nPlatner in an interview criticized the Trump administration in blunt terms. He called ICE a “political paramilitary group” that is kidnapping people and putting them in “essentially concentration camps.” He accused ICE of murder and said Trump officials are “living out their authoritarian fantasies” based on “nothing but racism and lies.”\n\nPlatner, who was in Norway this week with his wife while she received in vitro fertilization treatment, said he would join protests in Maine on Saturday. He said he supports Maine residents tracking the movements of ICE and using whistles to alert the public to agents’ presence, saying that opposing ICE requires both public officials and ordinary citizens.\n\nPlatner said the governor should direct law enforcement agencies to follow ICE agents to ensure they’re acting legally. And, he said, Mills should sue to try to limit enforcement activities in Maine.\n\nAnd Collins should be speaking out forcefully against “a federal agency being used to terrorize Mainers,” Platner said.\n\nThough the issue could hurt Collins, it carries risk for all three candidates. Platner, if he advances to a general election, could turn off moderate voters with his calls to confront officers or if he is seen as too soft on immigration. Mills, as governor, faces the prospect that she could be blamed for an escalation.\n\nDemocrats are debating the best way to respond politically. Blue Rose Research, a Democratic research firm, found in video testing that raw eyewitness footage and straightforward reporting on the Minneapolis shooting “drove meaningful increases in Trump disapproval, while ideological or maximalist rhetoric from elected officials often underperformed or backlashed,” according to a Jan. 13 memo obtained by The Post.\n\nMills has sought to fend off Platner’s more progressive rhetoric by highlighting her willingness to confront Trump. She made headlines last year when, with cameras rolling, she faced off with Trump in the White House over the state’s policies on transgender athletes. “We’ll see you in court,” she said in a clip that quickly spread online.\n\nAnother moment like the one in the White House could help her in the June primary, said Jessica Taylor, who analyzes Senate races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. But there are also major risks for Mills if anything goes awry in the state she runs, Taylor added.\n\nThe ICE surge could also affect the race for a Republican-leaning House seat in northern Maine. Democratic Rep. Jared Golden is not running for reelection, fueling Republican hopes of flipping it as they try to preserve their narrow control of the House. While most of the district is far from Portland, it includes Lewiston, where ICE has been active.\n\nBut Republicans view the Senate race as crucial to defending their 53-seat majority. The Senate Leadership Fund, the main Senate Republican super PAC, said this week that it was investing $42 million in the state, with most of the money going toward ads that will begin running in August.\n\nJason Savage, executive director of the Maine Republican Party, said he considered ICE’s operations “net neutral in an ordinary environment” because voters in the state broadly support law enforcement. But, he said, the agency’s activities are a “net positive” for Republicans “when both of the opponents are acting insane about it.”\n\nSome Democrats have argued that the deployment will hurt Collins.\n\n“Any time the Trump administration is sending ICE into communities and causing chaos, it will put the Republican legislators there - including, in this case, Susan Collins - in a very uncomfortable situation, because they are unable to break with Trump in a meaningful way,” said Lauren French, a spokesperson for Senate Majority PAC, the flagship Democratic super PAC involved in Senate races.\n\nDan Merica contributed to this report.","url":"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/24/nation/susan-collins-maine-immigration-raid/","image":"https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/QIVUZPSR5RBNJKXCYWRWF6LVMU.jpg?auth=e3c7f784f720c8ad9caa7c50aa4c8a1123519b5781b3d5e539cfcbfafe18bccf&width=1200&height=672","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 23:24:47","author":"Patrick Marley","authors":["Patrick Marley"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.213},{"id":395776548,"title":"Trump and Democrats harden their stances after Minneapolis shooting","text":"Bovino told reporters that “an individual approached U.S. Border Patrol agents with a nine millimeter semi-automatic handgun. The agents attempted to disarm the individual, but he violently resisted. Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, a border patrol agent fired defensive shots.” But when asked by a reporter when the individual drew his firearm, Bovino said the shooting is still under investigation.\n\nThe latest POLITICO Poll illustrates just how sharply views of ICE — and its presence in cities across the country — diverge along partisan lines. A majority of voters who backed Trump in 2024 — 57 percent — say risks to the lives of anti-ICE protestors are a price worth paying to carry out immigration enforcement, compared with just 15 percent of voters who backed former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBy contrast, nearly three-quarters of Harris voters — 71 percent — say it is not worth risking the lives of anti-ICE protesters to conduct immigration enforcement, a view shared by just 31 percent of Trump voters, the poll, conducted from Jan. 16 to 19, found.\n\nThe divide extends to perceptions of public safety: 64 percent of Trump voters say ICE agents make U.S. cities safer, while 80 percent of Harris voters say the opposite, that their presence is making them more dangerous.\n\nDemocrats also used heated language to describe the shooting. During a Democratic Senate primary debate in Texas on Saturday, state Rep. James Talarico raised the Minneapolis shooting, saying: “ICE shot a mother in the face. ICE kidnapped a 5-year-old boy. ICE executed a man in broad daylight on our streets just this morning. It’s time to tear down this secret police force and replace it with an agency that actually is going to focus on public safety.”\n\nHis opponent, Rep. Jasmine Crockett, also weighed in: “This is the fifth-highest funded military force in the entire world. And what are they doing? They’re killing people in the middle of the street.”\n\nWalz on Saturday urged the federal government to allow Minnesota officials to take control of the probe into the shooting. He told reporters that he said to the White House in an early morning call that “the federal government cannot be trusted to lead this investigation. The state will handle it, period.”\n\n“As I said last week, this federal occupation of Minnesota long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement,” Walz said at a press conference Saturday. “It’s a campaign of organized brutality against the people of our state. And today, that campaign claimed another life. I’ve seen the videos from several angles. And it’s sickening.”\n\nWhen asked for comment, the White House referred POLITICO to Trump’s Truth Social post and to a post on X from the Department of Homeland Security, which claimed, “The officers attempted to disarm the suspect but the armed suspect violently resisted.”","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/24/minneapolis-shooting-ice-trump-democrats-00745630","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/e211715/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F33%2F66%2Ff3dd85dc4fdbb7faa2732e801c89%2Fimmigration-enforcement-minnesota-53307.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 23:09:00","author":"Ben Johansen,Erin Doherty,Gregory Svirnovskiy","authors":["Ben Johansen","Erin Doherty","Gregory Svirnovskiy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.123},{"id":395853156,"title":"‘Loyal soldier’: A day on the trail with JD Vance, Trump’s ‘human Swiss Army Knife’","text":"For Vance, affectionately dubbed the “human Swiss Army Knife” by White House aides, that means hitting the road and hitting it hard to sell President Donald Trump’s agenda. \n\nWHITE HOUSE SAYS MINNESOTA DEMOCRATS ARE ‘INCITING INSURRECTION’ AFTER ‘TERRORIST TRIED TO ASSASSINATE’ OFFICERS\n\n“When people are aware of some of the things that we’ve done, and they connect them to administration policies, they’re much more likely to vote Republican,” Vance told the Washington Examiner in an interview aboard Air Force Two. \n\nThe Washington Examiner shadowed Vance in Ohio and Minnesota on Thursday, a two-state deployment that doubled as a test run for the message Republicans hope will carry them through 2026.\n\nFirst, in Toledo, the vice president honed the White House’s shifting message on affordability, a top-line issue for voters in competitive races across the country. Next, in Minneapolis, Vance met with immigration officials effectuating Trump’s deportation agenda and held a press conference with, largely hostile, local media outlets. \n\nTogether, the stops captured the two issues dominating the national conversation: cost of living and immigration. \n\nDespite the frigid temperatures on the ground — it was minus-two in Minneapolis by the time Vance departed for Washington — the vice president eschewed gloves, scarves, and headwear during the trip. Whether the native-Ohioan felt perfectly comfortable braving the elements or was trying to project strength for the cameras, his aides, many of whom also hail from the Buckeye State, clearly weren’t enjoying the winter climate. \n\nOne White House official, holding his gloved hands over his exposed ears while waiting on the tarmac in Ohio, turned to the press and joked, “Confirming on background: it is frigid.” Two other aides were pressed into assistance to kick open the rear door on Air Force Two, which had completely frozen solid, during the flight from Toledo to Minneapolis.\n\nSandwiched in between stops, Vance sat for a half-hour interview with the Washington Examiner. The vice president swapped his blazer for a bomber jacket and gave some candid insight on how he plans to walk the Trump tightrope in 2026 and beyond.\n\nVance, whose venture capital bona fides were put to good use last year by taking point on Trump’s directive to save TikTok, currently serves as the finance chairman of the Republican National Committee. The job presents both an opportunity and a challenge. \n\nTOM ROGAN: CHINA IS TOASTING TRUMP’S REPELLANT AFGHANISTAN RHETORIC\n\nIt means Vance can take an active hand in helping the GOP craft its midterm strategy and message. But it also means Vance could face blame if a blue wave wipes out Republicans in November — a result that could make an uncontested 2028 GOP presidential primary all the more unlikely. \n\nSince the Democrats swept the 2025 off-year elections, Republicans have steadily pressed the White House to do more to sell the president’s economic agenda. Yet, Trump himself hasn’t quite budged off his own 2024 messaging line, frequently accusing Democrats of pushing an “affordability hoax” and blaming the voters’ economic angst on his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. \n\nSome Republicans have privately vented that Trump’s plan of attack is completely devoid of strategy, and that he’s falling into the same trap that effectively ended Biden’s term at the midpoint in 2022. Vance pushed back on that notion during his interview with the Washington Examiner. \n\n“First of all, there is a strategy behind the messaging,” said the vice president. “A big part of what we need to do is just connect what people are seeing on the ground with what the administration is doing.”\n\n“I think the flip side of it is acknowledging, yes, there are a lot of people who are still struggling, but again, connecting that to some of the policy decisions made during the last administration,” Vance added. \n\nRNC REGROUPS AND RECALIBRATES FOR MIDTERM ELECTION FIGHT\n\nThe vice president pointed to take-home pay, which fell by some $3,000 on average under the Biden administration before rising by roughly $1,300 during Trump’s first year back in office.\n\n“If you’re an American in Toledo, Ohio, you’re still $1,700 – $1,800 poorer. So, acknowledging that there’s still a lot of work to do and letting people know we’re committed to do it, I think that’s certainly part of our strategy for the midterms,” said Vance. \n\nFor Vance, the pitch in places like Toledo is less about sweeping promises than steady reassurance — convincing voters things are improving, but it takes time. \n\nThe vice president said the administration could only do so much on its own and “ we really need Congress to do something” when it comes to “affordability in housing, affordability in health care.” \n\n“We need Congress to take votes on policies that would be a win for the American people. For example, if you have a few moderate Democrats join with Republicans, and we get 57 votes on a really good health care package — now, is that going to have an immediate impact on the American people? No, because you need 60 votes to actually get some of this stuff passed,” Vance said. “But so long as we’re able to say to the American people, ‘Republicans are working for you,’ I think they’ll reward us in November.”\n\nWhether Vance’s more nuanced economic framing resonates with a national audience remains to be seen, but he certainly received a warm welcome in his home state.\n\nThe vice president, whose rally playlist featured early-2000s country hits, country-adjacent pop songs, and a select sprinkling of Rihanna, received increasingly louder rounds of applause as he continued to both hammer Biden’s poor economic stewardship and link Trump’s deportation agenda to potential relief in the housing market.\n\nThat latter point will most certainly be tested given the current national debate surrounding ICE’s migrant raids and the protests they’re spawning in response.\n\nAccording to White House officials, Vance’s trip to Minneapolis was explicitly meant to “lower the temperature” on the issue of immigration. The vice president himself said as much during his remarks to the press in Minnesota, which followed a closed-door meeting with ICE agents, Customs and Border Protection officials, and local business leaders friendly to the administration.\n\nVance told the Washington Examiner that the administration will take disciplinary action, when “justified,” against ICE agents found guilty of wrongdoing.\n\n“If we think that there are disciplinary actions justified, then, of course, we’re gonna take those disciplinary actions. That’s a separate question from whether, for example, the ICE officer who was hit by this car was in reasonable defense or in reasonable fear of his life. We’re going to investigate that,” said Vance. “We’re also going to defend people who were doing their job in incredibly tough circumstances. You can do both of those things at the same time.”\n\nAnd just two days after Vance’s visit, violence again broke out on Minneapolis’ streets after ICE agents shot and killed a 37-year-old man filming federal officials, the second American citizen killed by ICE in Minneapolis this month. The Department of Homeland Security claimed that the victim was armed and threatened ICE officials, but videos of the incident appeared to show a group of 8-10 federal officials disarm the individual, beat him, then shoot him as many as 10 times while he was on the ground. Separate video appears to show ICE agents approach the individual, who was filming them with a cell phone, before the incident began. \n\nTRUMP THREATENS CHINA WITH 100% TARIFF OVER NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA\n\nIn both his sit-down with the Washington Examiner and in his Minneapolis press conference, Vance blamed local and state Democratic officials who uphold sanctuary city policies for the outbreak in violence.\n\n“This is crazy town, and it’s why Minneapolis has been so chaotic,” said Vance. “This is not the fault of ICE. This is the fault of left-wing agitators and also some local officials who are supporting those left-wing agitators instead of supporting law enforcement.”\n\nSticking with the Trump-line has helped cement Vance — alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio — as one of the party’s most closely watched figures heading into 2028. \n\nThe vice president notably did not discount a potential 2028 run of his own while speaking to the Washington Examiner. Instead, the vice president said he was focused on the immediate task before him. \n\n“One of the things that I try to keep as my North Star in this job is to focus on the job that I have, not on any future job I might want. That means that I give the president honest counsel, and that I execute his agenda, and I show loyalty to the man who tapped me to become his vice president because his success is fundamentally the success of the American people,” he told the Washington Examiner, adding that cabinet in Trump’s first administration sought to “enhance themselves by tearing down” the president. “So I’m going to keep on being a loyal soldier.”\n\nStill, Democratic officials have privately complained that they wished former Vice President Kamala Harris had done more to separate herself from Biden’s dismal record on the economy and the war in Gaza before and after ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket in 2024. Vance doesn’t seem worried about that problem. \n\nWhen asked by the Washington Examiner to assess his biggest regret, or the president’s greatest failing from 2025, Vance’s aides sought to end the interview, citing that we’d already run over time.\n\n“It’s ok, he can ask one more question,” the vice president intervened.\n\n“But I’m way too smart to answer that,” he added.","summary":"Marine.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also inadvertently reminds us that the only role of the current federal government is to execute President Donald Trump’s personal demands. \n\nLol, Lindsey Halligan. Lol.\n\nHalligan has held on as long as humanly possible, swanning around the Eastern District of Virginia and signing indictments as the U.S. attorney despite a court telling her she was not the U.S. attorney. Earlier this month, a judge ordered Halligan to explain why she thought she could do this, resulting in a filing that the judge in the case, Trump appointee David Novak, said “contains a level of vitriol more appropriate for a cable news talk show and falls far beneath the level of advocacy expected from litigants in this Court, particularly the Department of Justice.” \n\nWith that, you will likely not be surprised that Novak ruled this past Tuesday that no, really, the court did not stutter: Halligan cannot keep passing herself off as the U.S. attorney. \n\nSomehow, Novak was not swayed by Halligan’s argument that even though a judge ruled she wasn’t legally in her job and never had been, that somehow applied only to the prosecutions of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Nor did he buy her whining that, since former special counsel Jack Smith may have continued to sign things as special counsel after Judge Aileen Cannon threw out the classified documents case against Trump, she gets to cosplay as the U.S. attorney. Also a nope: the usual Justice Department argument that the court has no authority to do anything Trump doesn’t like. \n\nThe DOJ also told Novak that he was impinging on the executive branch's authority by reminding Halligan of her ethical obligations as a lawyer, and that the court could take action when ethical rules were violated. Novak didn’t like that one either, pointing out that being employed by the DOJ isn't some magical shield that protects attorneys from the ethical rules everyone else has to follow. \n\nNovak’s opinion dropped on Jan. 20, the same day that a different judge in the district published a vacancy notice, soliciting applicants for the interim U.S. attorney gig. Since Halligan is out, the judges in the U.S. attorney’s office can choose their own person for the role. \n\nThat very same day, Halligan finally announced she would be stepping down, which is an odd thing to announce about a job she never actually had. But if Halligan’s appointment as interim U.S. attorney had been valid, it would have expired on Jan. 20—120 days after she was fake-appointed. \n\nHalligan’s attempt to do the “You can’t fire me because I quit” move is equal parts pathetic and hilarious. Regardless, we won’t have her to kick around any longer. \n\nMaybe. Possibly. \n\nOkay, probably not. Halligan is an extremely bad penny, and she’s bound to turn up somewhere else. \n\nThanks, Aileen Cannon\n\nJudge Aileen Cannon is clutch when it comes to coming through for Trump. She has been protecting him for over a year now, keeping part two of Jack Smith’s special counsel investigation secret because Trump wants it that way. \n\nCannon has been presiding over a case by oversight and journalism watchdogs seeking to force the release of Smith’s report documenting his investigation into Trump’s illegal retention of classified documents, which he stashed at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Cannon helpfully enjoined its release, saying she couldn’t release it while Trump’s co-defendants were still litigating their criminal charges, but the DOJ dismissed those cases ages ago. \n\nCannon dragged her feet so long that in early November, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ordered her to rule on whether to release the report within 60 days, which came and went earlier this month. Instead, Cannon let Trump intervene in the lawsuit to explain how it would be unfair and make him very sad. \n\nNow, Cannon has a motion from Trump explaining that since she voided the prosecution by inventing some new rule that special counsels were basically illegal, the underlying report can never be released. It’s a perfect opportunity for one of Trump’s pet judges to display her fealty by protecting him yet again. \n\nThe New York Times grows a spine\n\nThe New York Times is pushing back against the comically broad discovery demand issued by Trump in one of his numerous private lawsuits. This is the one where he wants $15 billion from the Times, alleging they defamed him by writing about him, essentially. How dare they.\n\nThis is the case where the court threw out Trump’s original complaint, an 85-page whine about all his grievances, including how he didn’t get enough credit for “The Apprentice.” Trump refiled a shorter complaint, one that the Times has moved to dismiss, pointing out that the new complaint still doesn’t meet the basic requirements of a defamation claim: identifying specific false statements of fact and why they are untrue. The Times also asked that, if the court won’t dismiss the case, it be transferred out of the Middle District of Florida because the allegations all relate to conduct that occurred in New York, where The New York Times is based. \n\nWhile the motions to dismiss are pending, Trump is desperately trying to keep the case in Florida, demanding that the Times cough up information on readership metrics, printing, warehousing, and more. Trump seems to think that if the Times sold enough newspapers in Florida, he gets to keep the case there. \n\nThe Times wants discovery stayed while the court rules on the motions to dismiss so that they’re not jammed up, providing burdensome reams of irrelevant sales material for a case that will get thrown out or moved to the correct venue. \n\nThe mere fact that Trump has tried to push these onerous discovery demands while those motions are pending makes it pretty clear that this is designed to harass the Times, which is all these broadsides against the media are really about. Well, that and getting those media companies to give him millions of dollars to “settle” these spurious claims. \n\nIs it good when a judge says your arguments are ‘futile’?\n\nBecause that’s what a federal judge just told the Trump administration about its attempt to keep recycling the same arguments about why it can withhold billions from sanctuary cities. \n\nThe administration has been fighting this tooth and nail since last February, arguing not just that his administration can defund sanctuary cities but can also punish local officials in sanctuary jurisdictions for obstructing justice. And the plaintiffs have won again and again, so much so that the judge on the case, William H. Orrick, sounds a wee bit exasperated that the administration keeps trotting out arguments it has already rejected. \n\nThe administration sought to get the case dismissed by arguing that a court can’t actually rule on its attempts to yank money from sanctuary jurisdictions, a move that very much did not work. \n\nNow, the plaintiffs can proceed with their lawsuit—well, until the next time the Department of Justice throws a monkey wrench in everything. \n\nThe whole administration works for Donald Trump, private citizen\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt had a revealing slip of the tongue when issuing a straight-up threat to CBS from her official government perch. \n\nAfter CBS taped a 13-minute interview with Trump as part of their overall efforts to suck up to him, Leavitt relayed to “CBS Evening News” anchor Tony Dokoupil that Trump said, “Make sure you guys don’t cut the tape, make sure the interview is out in full.” When Dokoupil said CBS was already planning to do that, Leavitt upped the ante: “He said, ‘If it’s not out in full, we’ll sue your ass off.”\n\nIn short, Leavitt used her official role to threaten a major network into bowing to Trump, or else get sued. \n\nTrump, of course, has already sued CBS over a similar complaint about the network editing an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris rather than running it in its entirety. CBS gave Trump a cool $16 million bribe to “settle” this with Trump, the private citizen.\n\nLeavitt’s remarks are a new frontier in lawlessness, however. She's either saying that the government itself will take official action against CBS if Trump doesn’t get his way, or she’s saying there is no real daylight between official Trump and private Trump, so his personal lawsuits are blessed by the administration. Both of these are very bad!","summary":"Injustice for All is a weekly series about how the Trump administration is trying to weaponize the justice system—and the people who are fighting back.\n\n\n\n\nThis week, we say goodbye to supposed U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, which is great, but we also say hello to Judge Aileen Cannon, which is very not great.

Executives or employees who have inside knowledge of a company’s plans or performance cannot use that information to gain a financial advantage. The Securities and Exchange Commission constantly polices markets for signs of insider trading.\n\nCurrently, though, similar protections do not exist for traders on prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi, which have grown massively in recent months and allow users to bet on the outcomes of events large and small, ranging from presidential elections and NFL games to specific words used in press conferences or the amount of snowfall in a given day in New York City.\n\nThe presence of insider trading in prediction markets could be seen as a feature, not a bug, by prediction market proponents who value the markets for their accuracy and their ability to reflect all the best knowledge available — whether that information is coming from insiders or not.\n\nBut in recent weeks, several high-profile instances of suspected insider dealing have raised complaints from officials and legislators who say they are worried about traders getting ripped off — or even about prediction markets creating incentives for insiders to change the course of events. Now, the prospect of regulation or legislation looms for prediction markets.\n\nRep. Richie Torres (D-NY) said that the report of the Maduro inside trade was the kick he needed to come forward with a bill designed to curb insider trading on such platforms by government officials and aides.\n\n“My team and I were thinking about it for a while, but the impetus was the anonymous trade,” Torres told the Washington Examiner during an interview.\n\nWhat are prediction markets?\n\nKalshi, Polymarket, and other prediction markets offer event contracts that allow users to wager on outcomes.\n\nPrediction markets began receiving major attention during the 2024 elections, during which President Donald Trump bested then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Many pollsters predicted that Harris had the edge or that it would be an exceedingly close contest, with some calling the race a coin flip.\n\nKalshi users, on the other hand, were implying notably higher odds of a Trump win than many pollsters were. And the prediction became reality after Trump secured a decisive victory and won every major swing state.\n\nThe idea behind prediction markets is relatively simple: Users can buy shares in possible outcomes for various events. Using the example of the presidential race, one share on that market would represent a “yes” for Trump winning, and another a “no.” The price of a yes results in $1 if Trump does indeed win, but goes to zero if he loses. If the price starts at 50 cents, that implies that he has a 50% chance of winning. Any user who thought Trump’s odds were better than that could buy a yes contract. If Trump then won, he would have gotten 50 cents for every contract he bought at 50 cents.\n\nInsider trading fears\n\nThe Maduro trades were quickly flagged as being suspicious given the timing and the top-secret nature of the operation in Venezuela. And this isn’t the first time that certain prediction market trades have raised red flags.\n\nIn October, Norwegian officials who are in charge of awarding the Nobel Peace Prize said they were investigating after Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado’s odds suddenly shot up hours before her win was announced.\n\n“We take this very seriously,” Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, told Bloomberg at the time. “It seems we have been prey to a criminal actor who wants to earn money on our information.”\n\nIn December, a user on Polymarket raked in over $1 million in 24 hours by placing bets on Google’s 2025 Year in Search rankings, which many saw as suspiciously correct.\n\n“We’ve had many reports of suspicions over the last few months of such things,” Robin Hanson, a professor at George Mason University and an expert on prediction markets, told the Washington Examiner.\n\nHanson said that, fundamentally, the concerns about insider trading on these platforms come down to people and organizations and their ability to keep secrets.\n\nIt is also true that prediction markets do their own policing of insider trading on their platforms, said Todd Phillips, assistant professor of law in the Robinson College of Business at Georgia State University and former attorney for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n\n“There are rules in place that these markets have to have their own anti-manipulation rules and surveillance happening, and so I think it’s fair to say that they do try very hard to prevent manipulation and insider trading, kind of the same way that we try to prevent insider trading on stock markets,” Phillips said.\n\nHe said that if the platforms find someone engaging in manipulation, they can give that information to government authorities.\n\nStill, Ilya Belyin, a law professor at Seton Hall Law School, said there is little information out there about the extent of self-regulation, at least on Polymarket, where the Maduro trades were executed.\n\n“We have not seen Polymarket rigorously enforce its rules, so we really don’t know about self-regulation in this area, but it seems to be weak,” Belyin told the Washington Examiner.\n\nBut what regulation is there\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission is the government agency tasked with regulating prediction markets. \n\nThe CFTC oversees markets where people trade derivatives, or contracts tied to prices, for instance, for commodities such as oil or wheat. But prediction markets with event contracts also fall under the CFTC’s purview, so as those markets continue to proliferate, the CFTC will be the agency that looks into accusations of insider trading.\n\nIn 2020, the CFTC issued Kalshi regulatory approval, making it the first fully regulated financial exchange for event contracts. But the other prediction market behemoth, Polymarket, has its main exchange operating internationally.\n\n“The Maduro event contracts were traded on offshore, unregulated exchanges, so that contract was not listed on anything that is regulated by U.S. regulators,” Phillips told the Washington Examiner.\n\nIt is an open question of how aggressive the CFTC under Trump will be in regulating these prediction markets.\n\nCFTC Chairman Michael Selig acknowledged the growth of prediction markets in an op-ed this week, saying that U.S. financial markets “are ready for a golden age.”\n\n“As new asset classes emerge and the CFTC’s role evolves, guidelines we establish should not just fit the product, but also serve a tailored regulatory purpose,” Selig said. “Prediction markets have exploded in popularity as broad swaths of market participants seek to hedge portfolio risks and test their abilities to forecast truth.”\n\nBut Belyin said he is skeptical about CFTC enforcement with event contracts, in part, because of how new it all is and because the CFTC doesn’t have much of a history of enforcement related to event contracts.\n\nA CFTC spokesperson told the Washington Examiner that Selig is “committed to promoting market integrity and investor protection in markets within the CFTC’s regulatory jurisdiction.”\n\n“As he said during his confirmation hearing, he will engage with a broad array of stakeholders and policymakers to make informed decisions about the agency’s role in regulating emerging markets,” the spokesperson added. “This will necessarily require thoughtful consideration of very complex and evolving legal and policy issues.”\n\nPossible legislation?\n\nSome on Capitol Hill are pushing to crack down on the possibility of insider trading in prediction markets.\n\nThe Torres legislation, the Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026, has attracted 39 Democratic cosponsors so far.\n\nThe bill would specifically bar lawmakers, political appointees, executive branch employees, and congressional aides from trading prediction market contracts “tied to government policy, government action, or political outcomes when they possess material nonpublic information or could reasonably obtain such information through their official duties,” according to his office.\n\nTorres told the Washington Examiner that the prediction markets could facilitate corruption at the highest levels.\n\n“If you’re both a government insider and a participant in the prediction market, you now have a perverse incentive to push for policies that will line your pockets, and that kind of self-dealing is the very definition of corruption,” Torres said.\n\nTRUMP FLOATS OVERHAUL OF TAX RULES TO CRACK DOWN ON INSTITUTIONAL HOMEBUYERS\n\nNotably, Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour came out in support of the Torres legislation, drawing a distinction between his platform and other unregulated offshore platforms.\n\n“Kalshi is supportive of the bill Ritchie Torres is looking to introduce to affirm the ban on insider trading on prediction markets,” Mansour said. “Why? Because we already implement it. However, it’s important to emphasize that this American bill only applies to regulated, American companies and not to unregulated, non-American companies, which is where the alleged issues are occurring.”","summary":"In&#160;Focus&#160;delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

Wesley Hunt, R-Texas.\n\n“In 2020, the Census Bureau undercounted in primarily deep-red states like Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas, all red, while overcounting in radical blue states like Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, and Rhode Island,” Hunt told a Nov. 19, 2025, hearing of the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on the Constitution and Limited Government.\n\n“This egregious error led to many states being denied proper representation in Congress and the Electoral College. So much so that these errors costs Republicans … six seats in the House. In addition to the 2020 miscounting, including illegal immigrants in the census has improperly granted radical Left blue states 12 additional seats in the United States House of Representatives. That is a total of 18 seats gain and that is a huge problem. And those are the facts,” Hunt told the hearing.\n\nThe Census Bureau acknowledged the overcounts and the undercounts in a May 2025 report. The Census Bureau uses its population counts as the basis for determining how many House of Representatives seats are in each of the 50 states. The census counts all present individuals without distinguishing between citizens and noncitizens, meaning a higher head count gives a state more House seats, without regard to citizenship status.\n\nIt is illegal for noncitizens to vote in all federal elections, as well as the vast majority of state and local contests.\n\nNot all of the undercounted states were red, as deep-blue Illinois was among this group, while not all of the overcounted states were blue. Ohio and Utah, both red states, were among the over-counted group, according to the census report.\n\nMost congressional Republicans, like Hunt, support requiring Census Bureau counters to at least include a question about the citizenship of every counted individual, while most congressional Democrats oppose such a requirement. The issue has intensified in recent years, especially during the Biden administration’s open-border era in which millions of illegal immigrants crossed into the U.S.\n\nLegislation originally introduced in the House of Representatives in 2025 by Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas—the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act—requires proof of citizenship when registering to vote and provides criminal penalties for violations. The measure, which has 110 House co-sponsors, including Hunt, passed the lower chamber but has not been acted upon by the Senate. President Donald Trump supports the measure.\n\nHunt did not address the issue of whether political bias within the Census Bureau’s workforce could be a factor in the significant undercounting and overcounting, but The Washington Stand’s review of Federal Election Commission campaign contribution data for the years 2023, 2024, and 2025 found a huge bias in favor of Democrats among donors who said they work for the agency.\n\nDuring the three years indicated, the FEC records disclosed 4,037 contributions by individuals who listed “U.S. Census Bureau” as their employer. Of those contributions, 3,583 went to Democrats, compared to 455 made to Republicans, for a 7-1 ratio. The average Democrat contribution was for $29, while the average Republican contribution was $229.\n\nInterestingly, the total dollar value of the contributions by Census Bureau workers to Democrats was $104,597, only slightly more than the $104,130 total given to Republicans.\n\nFederal workers like those at the Census Bureau are covered by the Hatch Act, which bars partisan political activities by government employees while on official duty. The Hatch Act does not limit the right of government employees to work for candidates while off-duty, to contribute to the candidates of their choice, or to participate in activities supporting candidates, as long as federal property is not used in the process.\n\nTwo-thirds of the Democratic contributions, or 1,999 of the 3,582 total, were given through ActBlue, a digital site that acts as a conduit for campaign funding from individuals to favored candidates. WinRed, the similar digital site created by Republicans to counter ActBlue, accounted for only 253 contributions to GOP candidates by Census Bureau workers.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris, the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, received 347 contributions from Census workers, compared to just 69 for Trump, her 2024 Republican rival.\n\nApprised of the Census Bureau employee contribution bias, Hunt provided the following statement to The Washington Stand:\n\n“The inaccuracies and deliberate manipulations embedded in Democrat-led Census reporting expose a level of corruption that plagued the previous administration and continues today under radical Left leadership. Despite these efforts, the American people saw through the deception and delivered a decisive victory for Donald Trump in the last election.\n\n“Now, with Republicans holding all three chambers of government, we have both the responsibility and the obligation to correct these abuses immediately and restore integrity to the process by ensuring that Census data reflects only United States citizens.\n\n“The irony is unmistakable. For years, Democrats have warned of a supposed threat to democracy, while actively engaging in the very practices that undermine it—manipulating systems designed to distort representation and influence elections. Democracy is not endangered by transparency and lawful governance. It is endangered by those who abuse institutions for political gain.”\n\nHunt will not be in the House of Representatives in 2027, as he is seeking the Republican nomination for the Senate in a hotly contested primary that also includes Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and the Lone Star State’s long-serving incumbent, Sen. John Cornyn. The primary election is March 3, 2026.\n\nOriginally published by The Washington Stand","summary":"Undercounting the population in red states like Texas and Florida in 2020 cost Republicans at least six seats in the House of Representatives, while overcounting...

The strategy, signed by War Secretary Pete Hegseth, emphasizes an approach of ‘peace through strength’, rebuilding US military power and prioritizing what it defines as direct American interests, alongside a demand that Washington’s allies shoulder a greater share of the burden. Israel is described as a ‘model ally’. The roughly 34-page document portrays the global security environment prior to Trump’s return to the White House in January 2025 as ‘one of the most dangerous in American history’, a pointed jab at former president Joe Biden and his administration. It sets out four main lines of effort: defending the homeland, deterring China in the Indo-Pacific, increasing burden sharing with allies and revitalizing the American defense industrial base. In contrast to the previous administration led by Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, which the document says ‘tied Israel’s hands’, the new strategy offers unusually strong praise for Israel, repeatedly defining it as a ‘model ally’. Israel is mentioned no fewer than 10 times. Among other passages, the document states: ‘In the Middle East, Israel has proven that it is willing and able to defend itself after the barbaric attacks of October 7. In short, it is a model ally. Yet instead of empowering Israel, the previous administration tied its hands.’ Later, in a section dealing with Iran and the Middle East, amid ongoing tensions and the possibility that Trump could order a strike on the Islamic republic, the strategy adds: ‘Israel has long demonstrated that it is willing and able to defend itself with critical but limited support from the United States. Israel is a model ally, and we now have an opportunity to further empower it to defend itself and advance our shared interests, building on President Trump’s historic efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East.’ The document notes that Israel received critical US support during the ‘12-day war’ with Iran and that American forces helped Israel achieve what it describes as historic operational and strategic successes. It adds that Israeli actions severely damaged Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis, while the United States conducted its own operation against the Houthis from March through May last year, Operation ‘Rough Rider’, aimed at restoring freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. Under the section detailing the war department’s missions, the strategy states: ‘The department will encourage regional allies and partners to take primary responsibility for deterring and defending against Iran and its proxies, including through strong support for Israel’s efforts to defend itself, deepening cooperation with our partners in the Arab Gulf and enabling integration between Israel and our Gulf partners, building on President Trump’s historic initiative, the Abraham Accords.’ The strategy places a renewed focus on homeland defense, including protection of US borders, the Panama Canal, Greenland and efforts to combat drug smuggling. It also reiterates deterrence against China and calls on allies to raise defense spending to 5 percent of gross domestic product, including 3.5 percent for military forces and 1.5 percent for broader security needs. In Europe, NATO allies are expected to bear primary responsibility for confronting Russia, including support for Ukraine. On the Korean Peninsula, South Korea is tasked with leading the effort against North Korea. The Middle East, including Israel, is presented as a region where ‘local partners can and should do more’. The document highlights major operations as key elements of deterrence, including Operation ‘Midnight Hammer’, the June strike that destroyed Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan, Operation ‘Absolute Resolve’ to capture Venezuelan ruler Nicolas Maduro, and Operation ‘Rough Rider’ in Yemen. Overall, the new defense strategy reflects what it calls a ‘hardnosed realism’ under the banner of ‘America First’, Trump’s campaign slogan, while rejecting what it describes as the ‘utopian idealism’ of previous administrations. It pledges that the US military will serve as the president’s ‘sword and shield’ in pursuit of lasting peace, while remaining ready to win any war if required.","summary":"The US war department publishes President Trump’s 2026 National Defense Strategy, stressing deterrence against China, higher burden sharing by allies, border and asset protection and a rebuilt defense industry while praising Israel’s conduct after October 7","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1tarkf8be","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/05/15/HJ87GKQbgl/HJ87GKQbgl_0_0_3000_2000_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 18:17:15","author":"Itamar Eichner","authors":["Itamar Eichner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":0.022},{"id":395725406,"title":"US federal agents shoot and kill man in Minneapolis","text":"A man who was shot on Saturday by US federal immigration officers in Minneapolis has died, a hospital record shows.\n\nThe shooting comes less than three weeks after Renee Good, an American citizen, was shot and killed by a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officer in Minneapolis while she was driving away from a confrontation, sparking protests nationwide.\n\nThe hospital record was obtained by the Associated Press. The man’s death was also reported by CNN, citing the city’s police chief.\n\nThe US department of homeland security distributed a photo of a handgun they said was on the person who was shot.\n\nAfter the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and screamed profanities at federal officers, calling them “cowards” and telling them to go home.\n\nOne officer responded mockingly as he walked away, telling them: “Boo hoo.” Agents elsewhere shoved a yelling protester into a car.\n\nCity officials said in their statement that the “shooting involving federal law enforcement” occurred in the area of West 26th Street and Nicollet Avenue South – and that they are “working to confirm additional details”.\n\n“We ask the public to remain calm and avoid the immediate area,” the statement added.\n\nA law enforcement source directly briefed on the situation provided the Guardian with a photo of a handgun next to a loaded magazine. “Suspect had a firearm with two magazines,” the source said. “Situation evolving. Will get ... more information ASAP.”\n\nMinnesota’s governor, Tim Walz, added in a statement shortly afterward that he has spoken with the White House “after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning”.\n\n“Minnesota has had it,” said Mr Walz, who was Kamala Harris’s running mate in the 2024 presidential election that she lost to Donald Trump. “This is sickening.”\n\n“The president must end this operation,” Walz also said, referring to the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration enforcement operation in the state.\n\n“Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota,” he added. “Now.”\n\nThe Minneapolis police department and the US department of homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday.\n\nA video circulating online, which matches the reported location of the shooting mentioned by the officials, shows a man being wrestled to the ground by several law enforcement officers before being shot, what appears to be, several times. At least two officers can be seen with their weapons drawn.\n\nLive video of the scene after the shooting shows dozens of federal agents surrounding the scene, deploying what appears to be chemical irritants into the crowd of people that have gathered in the streets where the shooting occurred. People are yelling at agents, honking horns and recording.\n\nBill Melugin of Fox News, which is generally aligned with the Trump administration, quickly reported on Saturday that he was told by “multiple law enforcement sources” that border patrol was the agency involved in the shooting. Mr Melugin reported being told the person is “down”, and medics were working on the person. \n\nOn Friday, thousands of demonstrators braved bitter cold to march through the streets of Minneapolis demanding an end to Mr Trump’s immigration crackdown in their city, part of a wider “ICE OUT!” show of defiance that organisers billed as a general strike.\n\nOn a day that started with temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees, organisers said as many as 50,000 people took to the streets, a figure that Reuters could not verify, as Minneapolis police did not respond to a request for a crowd estimate. Many demonstrators later gathered indoors at the Target Center, a sports arena with a capacity of 20,000 that was more than half full.\n\nOrganisers and participants said scores of businesses across Minnesota closed for the day and workers headed to street protests and marches, which followed weeks of sometimes violent confrontations between Ice agents and protesters opposed to Mr Trump’s surge.\n\nJust a day earlier, US vice-president JD Vance visited Minneapolis in a demonstration of support for Ice officers and to ask local leaders and activists to reduce tensions, saying Ice was carrying out an important mission to detain immigration violators.\n\nIn one of the more dramatic protests, local police arrested dozens of clergy members who sang hymns and prayed as they knelt on a road at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport in calling for Trump to withdraw the 3,000 federal law enforcement officers sent to the area. – Agencies","summary":"Second incident comes after Renee Good was shot and killed by an Ice agent in the US city earlier in January","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/2026/01/24/us-federal-agents-shoot-another-person-in-minneapolis-says-governor-tim-walz/","image":"https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/5KYPW2DYBGRGFPXOF7D3ZYYD2A.jpg?auth=e538361535ff2e207d4098be96556ce1c1a14987f89e65e71d97a6dc8acd3f9f&smart=true&width=1600&height=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 17:38:26","author":"Sat Jan 24 2026 - 17:38","authors":["Sat Jan 24 2026 - 17:38"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.384},{"id":395709926,"title":"James Carville’s On-Air Meltdown Is Hard to Watch","text":"James Carville was known as a sharp political mind until President Donald Trump broke him. He’s gone so far off the rails that it really makes no sense why anyone even bothers to get his take on current events. He confidently predicted — guaranteed, really — that Kamala Harris would win the 2024 election. He couldn’t separate his personal bias from reality, and wound up with egg on his face. He’s not sought after for his honest insight; he’s sought after because his reputation is being exploited to make leftists feel better when they’re told what they want to hear.\n\nCarville appeared on The Beat with Ari Melber on MSNOW Friday night, and quickly made clear he was in no mood for restraint. Melber introduced him as a “legendary Democratic strategist” and asked a straightforward question about the week’s polling and protests. What followed sounded like a man who has completely lost his grip on reality.\n\nCarville immediately launched into a bizarre tirade about President Trump, Davos, and social media, and it was so crazy, I kept waiting for orderlies in white shirts to come get him.\n\n“Well, let’s talk about Trump at Davos and his midnight nocturnal tweets,” Carville said. “He’s a flea-bitten dog baying at the moon. Okay, I apologize, kennel clubs and dog lovers. I don’t mean to drag the reputation of flea-bitten dogs through the mud, but it’s the best metaphor I can come up with,” he said. “He’s just howling and howling and howling, and you can’t reason with him. Oh, dear, that’s 200 and, you know, 38,855 miles away. It can’t hurt you. It’s orbiting the Earth, and Earth orbits the sun,” he said, before concluding, “You’re talking to a flea-bitten dog.”\n\nICYMI: Sen. Kennedy Schools Bill Maher, and I Bet He Hated That\n\nI haven’t even gotten to the craziest part yet. The real moment that revealed just how far off the rails he has gone came when he turned to Republicans planning a mini-convention for the midterms.\n\nAccording to Carville, this was not a routine political gathering or campaign stop. It was something far darker.\n\n“And the big news, and if you look at your story in Minneapolis, the Republicans are… claiming they’re gonna have a midterm mini-convention with Trump attending,” Carville said. “They’re gonna go to Minneapolis, and he’s gonna try to provoke a race war.”\n\nYes, a race war. On national television. Without evidence. Without specifics. Without any grounding in reality.\n\n\"Listen to me,\" he added. \"This summer, the Republicans will go to Minneapolis. He's going to try to provoke a race war... he's going to go to Minneapolis to try to provoke these people in all over, and it's going to be summertime, and the weather's going to be good. And it's, it's — he's trying to create a race war. I don't think he will succeed, because I don't think people will take the bait. But they'd better be warned. I'm serious.\"\n\nHe emphasized that point again for good measure.\n\n“I, I’m really serious when I put these two events together,” he said.\n\nThis is why Carville can’t be taken seriously anymore. He’s given up the pretense of offering political analysis and selling his paranoid meltdown as legitimate insight. He projected onto Trump the very racial chaos Democrats have spent years excusing and fomenting. It’s only been five years since the riots that left parts of Minneapolis smoldering. In Carville’s warped telling, every Trump rally is a looming catastrophe, every Republican gathering a provocation, and every expression of free speech an existential threat.\n\nThere was once a time when Democrat consultants were sane and had insightful things to say that you could actually learn from, even if you disagreed with their politics. I miss those days.\n\nCarville’s talk of a looming “race war” that the GOP would start bordered on delusion, and his suggestion that Trump would deploy the military to inflame racial violence reeks of paranoid schizophrenia, not reasoned political insight from a seasoned political consultant. He deserves a straitjacket, not a national audience.\n\nWant to support fearless journalism that exposes the left and tells the stories the media won’t?

The British pop star, whose sixth studio album became a cultural and commercial phenomenon synonymous with an attitude of spiky independence in 2024, is moving on to a new passion: film. And she has unofficially launched her new chapter here at the Sundance Film Festival with “The Moment.” The A24 film, directed by Aidan Zamiri and co-written by Zamiri and Bertie Brandes, is a satire about Charli’s life at the height of her fame, at the end of “brat summer” in 2024 as she was preparing to embark on her first arena tour. The movie, which will open in theaters Jan. 30, stars Charli as herself, Alexander Skarsgård as a pompous director trying to take over her tour and Rosanna Arquette as a steely record label head, and it includes cameos from stars like Kylie Jenner, Julia Fox and Rachel Sennott. “Right now, unlike the me in the film, I am sort of like really wanting ‘brat’ to stop and actually pivot, like as far away as possible,” Charli said from the stage of Sundance’s 2,500-seat Eccles Theatre. “And that’s not because I don’t love it. It’s just because I think for all of us as artists, you want to challenge yourself and … totally switch the creative soup that you’re in and go and live in a different bowl for a while and feel enriched by that.” Charli is definitely entering new creative territory in 2026. In addition to “The Moment,” she has acting roles in two other films at Sundance, Gregg Araki’s “I Want Your Sex,” in which she plays a character who fakes an orgasm with Cooper Hoffman, and an art world satire called “The Gallerist” with Natalie Portman and Zach Galifianakis, which premieres Saturday night. “They call it XCX Dance I hear,” Zamiri joked onstage when festival director Eugene Hernandez mentioned Charli’s diverse slate. She also wrote the soundtrack for the new Warner Bros. film “Wuthering Heights,” starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, which opens Feb. 13. “The Moment,” however, is the project that showcases Charli front and center. The artist previously described a brat as someone who likes to party, “says some dumb things sometimes” and is “honest, blunt and a little bit volatile.” After the release of “brat,” the album became an aesthetic, with its signature green color and typeface turning up in memes and even in messaging from the Kamala Harris campaign. In the film, the once-underground club artist is seen feeling disoriented by her new mainstream success and barraged by people who want to capitalize on it in questionable ways. She gets all kinds of advice, including from Jenner, who suggests, “The second you think people are getting sick of you, that’s when you have to go even harder.” “I think I am, as an artist, quite a volatile person,” Charli said onstage after the premiere. “And nice, though. I am quite nice too … right? But having been in the music industry since I was 16, it’s like I’ve gone through various different stages in my career where I’ve felt on top of the world or felt like absolute s---. ... For me, I’ve had a lot of practice reacting to all of those different characters in my real life, so I think I was drawing from that really.” The filmmakers said an inspiration for the movie’s tone was the late Rob Reiner’s 1984 mockumentary “This Is Spinal Tap.” Still, if Charli is ready to close the “brat” chapter, her fans may be harder to convince. Ticket holders and festival volunteers lined up outside the theater in the snow on Friday night wearing lime-green beanies — a promotional item from the film — and holding copies of the album. “I feel like she has been big for a while, but not as popular as she deserves,” said Hibba Ahmed, 21, from Salt Lake City. “I love her confidence. … The brand that she’s built people are so easily able to recognize and identify with,” said Gabrielle Held, 23, a production assistant from Atlanta. “It can be interpreted in so many different ways, and everybody can enjoy it for different reasons.” When asked whether they are ready to say goodbye to “brat,” some fans in line said they are on board for whatever Charli’s evolution may involve. “She said she wants to get into film. She wrote a lot about it in her Substack,” said Emma Roth-Wells, 23, who lives in Salt Lake City, adding that it’s “exciting.” “I do hope she also continues her music.” At the movie’s after-party, police on horseback forcefully pushed people away from the crowded door at the Premiere lounge on Main Street, where partygoers on the list were given brat-green wristbands to enter. Inside, as a DJ spun Rihanna, the Verve and, yes, Charli XCX, bartenders served cocktails in Poppi soda cans branded with “The Moment.” Among the attendees were stars from Charli’s other film that premiered that night, “I Want Your Sex,” including Hoffman and Chase Sui Wonders, as well as local celebrity John Barlow, the husband of “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City’s” Lisa Barlow, the self-anointed queen of Sundance. Charli’s moment at Sundance continues on Saturday, where she is expected to appear at a TikTok panel and where audiences will get their first look at “The Gallerist.” She is attending the festival in a particularly significant year, its last in Park City before moving to Boulder, Colorado, in 2027 and its first since the death of its founder, Robert Redford. Though Charli may seem ubiquitous in Park City this year, not everyone at Sundance, an event that draws cinephiles from all corners of culture, was aware of her. In a line for a panel on environmental films Friday afternoon, one attendee mentioned that night’s upcoming “The Moment” premiere to his friends. “Who’s Charli XCX?” one friend asked. “Remember ‘brat summer’?” he said. “Vaguely,” she replied. At least in that Sundance line, when it comes to moving on from brat, Charli may already be getting her wish.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/charli-xcx-sundance-film-festival-the-moment-brat-rcna255483","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260124-charli-xcx-mn-1025-44cac4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 17:15:26","author":"Rebecca Keegan","authors":["Rebecca Keegan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.392},{"id":395976786,"title":"Trump vows to skip Super Bowl, bashes Bad Bunny and Green Day - USA Today","text":"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump made history last year by being the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl.\n\nThis year, he's skipping the big game, which is set for Feb. 8 in California.\n\nHe told the New York Post in a Jan. 23 interview that the blockbuster event is \"just too far away.\"\n\nBut he's also unhappy about the musical performers, which include noted Trump critics Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny and the rock band Green Day.\n\n“I’m anti-them,\" said the president, though he stressed that's not his reason for avoiding the game. \"I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible.\"\n\nExplained: Trump vs. Bad Bunny, Green Day\n\nThe performing artists for Super Bowl LX have separately expressed public criticism of the president.\n\nTrump has clashed in particular with upcoming halftime performer Bad Bunny, one of the most popular musicians in the world who supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. Dubbed the \"King of Latin Trap,\" he was Spotify's most listened-to artist globally last year for the fourth time. (Statistics shared exclusively with USA TODAY showed he was streamed more than 60 million times daily on the app.)\n\nThe reggaeton didn't schedule any stops in the United States for his latest world tour, in part due to concerns about the Trump administration's widely aggressive immigration enforcement policies.\n\n\"There were many reasons why I didn't show up in the U.S., and none of them were out of hate,\" the rapper told I-D magazine. \"But there was the issue of—like, (expletive) ICE could be outside (my concert). And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about.\"\n\nThe rock band Green Day, which will kick off the Super Bowl at the opening ceremony, has slammed Trump many times over the years. During a New Year's Eve performance two years ago, frontman Billie Joe Armstrong altered the lyrics of the group's hit song “American Idiot” from \"I'm not a part of a redneck agenda\" to \"I'm not a part of the MAGA agenda.\"\n\nThe artists have taken more recent digs at Stephen Miller, one of Trump's chief West Wing advisers, and the president's immigration enforcement agenda more broadly.\n\nWhen is the 2026 Super Bowl? Who's playing?\n\nThe title game will take place on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\n\nThe playing teams will be determined by the outcomes of this weekend's conference championships. The New England Patriots will play against the Denver Broncos for the AFC's spot, while the Los Angeles Rams are vying against the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC.\n\nZachary Schermele is a congressional reporter for USA TODAY.

Gavin Newsom is back from his all-expense-paid trip to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum. Guess who paid for it.\n\nEvery special interest in California.\n\nKCRA in Sacramento reported that the cost of this trip, like all the governor's official travel, was paid by the California State Protocol Foundation. The mission of the foundation is \"to lessen the burden on California taxpayers by relieving California of its obligations to fund certain expenditures.\"\n\nThat's how it's described in the publicly available behested payment reports that Gov. Newsom filed, as required, with the Fair Political Practices Commission. The FPPC explains on its website that a behested payment is not a gift or a campaign contribution, but a payment made \"at the request, suggestion, or solicitation of, or made in cooperation, consultation, coordination, or concert with the public official.\"\n\nThat explanation can be shortened to just one word: \"shakedown.\"\n\nUnlike donations to a campaign committee or PAC, behested payments have no contribution limit. The only limitation is that the payments must be for a \"legislative, governmental or charitable purpose.\" Payments totaling $5,000 or more in a calendar year from a single source must be reported within 30 days.\n\nBehested payments have funded the California State Protocol Foundation. In 2025, Newsom “behested” a payment of $220,000 from the University of California Berkeley for the \"charitable\" purpose of paying the costs of attending the Vatican climate summit. He \"behested\" the U.S. Energy Foundation out of $150,000 to pay for his \"delegation\" to the COP30 climate change conference in Brazil, also described as a \"charitable\" purpose.\n\nNewsom hit up Zoox, Inc., an autonomous vehicle subsidiary of Amazon, and Centene Management Company, LLC, of St. Louis, “a leading provider of government-sponsored healthcare,” for $25,000 each \"in support of general operations\" of the Protocol Foundation.\n\nBut the largest behested payments came from Newsom's own inaugural committees. The \"2023 Governor's Inaugural Fund\" paid the California State Protocol Foundation a total of $2 million in 2023 and 2024. The \"Governor's Inaugural Fund 2019\" paid $700,000 in April 2019 and $2,436,317 in May 2020.\n\nThe reports of behested payments to the inaugural committees reveal who was on the receiving end of a “request, suggestion or solicitation” from the newly elected or re-elected governor.\n\nEverybody. Indian tribes, apartment associations, beverage companies, health care and hospital companies, the carpenters' union, the nurses' union, the teachers' union, the firefighters' union, the prison guards’ union, AT&T, Amazon, Uber, the service employees, the electrical workers, the pipe trades council, the building industry association, the operating engineers, the professional engineers, the charter schools, the aircraft manufacturers and many, many more.\n\nAbout $5.1 million of the roughly $8.8 million that Newsom asked special interests to pay for the \"governmental\" purpose of inaugural events ended up transferred to the Protocol Foundation, where it is used to prop up the governor on the world stage as he emotes for cameras about climate change and complains that not enough has been done to stop Donald Trump.\n\nNot enough? Jack Smith, Letitia James, Alvin Bragg, Fani Willis, Hillary Clinton, the January 6th Committee, two sets of impeachment prosecutors and whoever allowed that sniper on the roof in Butler must be wondering what it takes to impress Gavin Newsom.\n\nDemocratic political analyst and former Obama advisor David Axelrod wrote in an online post that he was finding Newsom's \"’Why can't people just be as courageous as ME?' routine\" to be \"tedious.\"\n\nIt was certainly predictable. Before Newsom left California for Davos, his office was telling reporters that he would present California as an alternative to the Trump administration, \"a beacon of stability and loyalty.\"\n\nWhat does that even mean? Are we going to defend Europe with $6 billion in carbon credits and a third of a bullet train?\n\nWhen he got off the plane in Davos, Newsom was a regular insult comic. He told reporters that U.S. allies were \"pathetic\" for not standing up to Trump. He said the president \"is a T-rex – you mate with him or he devours you.\" He waved around knee pads to show contempt for leaders he views as being on their knees to Trump.\n\nAsked about Newsom's criticisms, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent went full Don Rickles. Opening with, \"Governor Newsom, who strikes me as Patrick Bateman meets Sparkle Beach Ken,\" Bessent went on to roast Newsom as \"the only Californian who knows less about economics than Kamala Harris.\" He got in a dig about Newsom's \"billionaire sugar daddy, Alex Soros\" and worked in the \"$1,000-a-night meals at the French Laundry\" during the COVID lockdown.\n\nRickles might have paid a lot for that \"American Psycho\" meets \"Barbie\" joke. But Bessent was probably not joking when he said this: \"My message to Governor Newsom is the Trump administration is coming to California. We are going to crack down on waste, fraud and abuse.\"\n\nNewsom had been scheduled to speak at an event connected to the World Economic Forum, but somehow he was canceled, missing out on a high-profile opportunity to claim that his state is leading the world on climate change.\n\nIf Newsom had dreams of flying to Davos and being praised by world leaders as an alternative to Trump who is both superior and inevitable, the Trump team acidly crushed them. \"No one in Davos knows who third-rate governor Newscum is or why he is frolicking around Switzerland instead of fixing the many problems he created in California,\" a White House spokesperson said.\n\nBut all is not lost for the governor. He still has enough juice in California to get a free trip.\n\nWrite Susan@SusanShelley.com and follow her on X @Susan_Shelley\n\nTribune Regional CA\n\nThis story was originally published January 24, 2026 at 8:10 AM.","url":"https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/us-viewpoints/article314438965.html","image":"https://www.sacbee.com/wps/build/images/sacbee/facebook.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 16:10:38","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.181}]}
