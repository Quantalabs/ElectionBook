Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy ASHLEIGH GRAY \n Published:00:49 BST, 13 October 2025 |Updated:00:57 BST, 13 October 2025 \n\nJohn Legend weighed in on President Donald Trump's failed ambitions to win a Nobel Peace Prize, despite his peace deal in the Middle East between Israel and Gaza.\nThe 79-year-old second-term Commander-in-Chief lost this year's nomination to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado. \nAnd on Sunday, the 46-year-old singer had words of advice for Trump if he'd like to campaign for the honor in 2026: 'Stop declaring war on the American people, stop sending the military intro our cities simply because they're run by Democrats.'\n'He'd have to stop all this authoritarian dictator sh*t, all the fascist sh*t, all the inhumane sh*t he’s been trying to do,' Legend added. \nThe Save Room music artist mentioned his personal connection to the award, after having performed at 2017's Nobel ceremony. \nLegend, born John Roger Stephens, used Instagram to record a straightforward statement directed at the politician on Saturday.\n\nJohn Legend, 46, weighed in on President Donald Trump's failed ambitions to win a Nobel Peace Prize, stating he'd have to 'stop all this authoritarian dictator sh*t' first\n\nLegend shared a video trolling Trump's bid for the coveted prize on Sunday, captioned: 'Trump for Peace Prize 2026!'\n\nThe 79-year-old second-term Commander-in-Chief lost this year's nomination to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado; pictured October 9\nHe captioned the video post, shared with his nearly 16 million followers: 'Trump for Peace Prize 2026!' \nThe Voice coach has long been an outspoken critic of Trump's, declaring him a racist in past remarks.\nBut on Sunday he took a softer, though snarky, approach to his differences with the former reality TV show host. \n\n Homeland Security fires back after Chappell Roan's anti-ICE outburst at LA concert \nLegend rattled off previous winners of the Nobel Peace Prize, noting that it's often been gifted to human rights activists and world leaders who had negotiated a big peace agreement.\nHe also acknowledged that the president has 'made a step in the right direction' with the recent ceasefire he helped negotiate between Palestine and Israel. \n'We all want to see peace in Gaza, in the West Bank,' he declared in the video. 'And President Trump has been instrumental in bringing about this new peace deal.'\nAnd he added, 'Let's all pray that this deal is actually lasting, that it's long-term. The people of Gaza have had their lives and their communities destroyed for the past two years.'\n'If this peace is really lasting, we just might see Donald Trump get that peace prize that he really, really wants,' the musician said. \n\nThe singer had words of advice for Trump if he'd like to campaign for the honor in 2026: 'Stop declaring war on the American people, stop sending the military intro our cities simply because they're run by Democrats'\n\n'He'd have to stop all this authoritarian dictator sh*t, all the fascist sh*t, all the inhumane sh*t he’s been trying to do,' Legend added\n\nLegend and wife Chrissy Teigen have been candid about their anti-Trump stance; pictured in October 2024\n\nIn February Legend defended DEI and labeled Trump a 'white supremacist' while speaking at The Fifteen Percent Pledge's 15th Street Block Party in Hollywood\n\nThe Voice coach has long been an outspoken critic of Trump's, declaring him a racist in past remarks; pictured October 7\n\nWhile explaining that he too wants to see Trump win the award, he outlined what behavioral changes the Leader of the Free World will have to make.\n'Believe it or not, I want you to do this. I want this peace prize for you so badly. I want this for us, for all of us. Hear me out, y'all. \n'If Trump is able to actually earn the peace prize, it probably won't be enough that he's helped bring peace to the Middle East,' he prefaced before listing his latest gripes with the Trump administration.\n'Let's look at what else he would have to do: He'd have to stop sending Black Hawk helicopters to terrorize people while they sleep in their apartment buildings in Chicago,' he said, referencing the recent incident in Illinois.\n'Yes, the so-called \"Peace President\" who's ending wars around the world would also have to stop declaring war on the American people,' he emphasized. 'Stop sending the military into our cities simply because they're run by Democrats.'\nAnd pointing to the widespread ICE raids, he added, 'Stop sending masked, unaccountable ICE agents to torment immigrant communities. Stop ordering the prosecution of his political opponents on flimsy charges.'\nLegend said that in order for Trump to win the prize, he would also have to 'stop bombing boats in the Caribbean, stop executing people without proving that they've done anything wrong.'\nHe'd have to stop all this authoritarian, dictator sh*t, all the fascist sh*t, all the inhumane shit he's been trying to do.' \nToward the end of the clip, Legend stated: 'We should all really, really want Donald J. Trump to earn a Nobel Peace Prize, right?'\nThe day prior, Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria explained why she chose to dedicate the award to Trump following her shock win.\nMachado, who leads the opposition to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, was announced as this year's winner 'for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela,' the committee announced.\nHer victory came as a surprise to many who believed that that Trump would be honored with the award.\nShortly after her win Machado took to X where she explained that many people across the world are relying on the president, 'to achieve Freedom and democracy'.\n\nNobel Peace Prize winner Maria explained in a recent interview why she dedicated her award to Trump \n\nMachado praised Trump as a 'clear and courageous leader' and argued that he's ended numerous wars during his presidency \n\n'I dedicate this prize to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!' Machado wrote.\nOn Saturday she further explained the dedication during an interview with Rachel Campos-Duffy on Fox News where she heaped praise on the president.\n'Not only has he been involved in only a few months in solving eight wars, but his actions have been decisive to have Venezuela now at a threshold of freedom after 26 years of tyranny,' she said.\nShe praised Trump as being a 'clear and courageous' leader, arguing that he's been an advocate for dismantling criminal structures in Venezuela.\nJohn LegendDonald TrumpDemocratsIsrael\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJohn Legend trolls Donald Trump over Nobel Peace Prize bid: 'Stop all this authoritarian dictator s***!'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 40\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email jada.bas@dailymail.co.uk \nBy JADA BAS, TRAINEE REPORTER \n Published:23:54 BST, 12 October 2025 |Updated:00:15 BST, 13 October 2025 \n\nWould-be drivers are being fleeced out of hundreds of pounds by social media scammers promising to give them full UK licences - without ever having to take a test.\nTikTok fraudsters are offering desperate learner drivers the chance to skip the queue in what they call 'driving made easy', encouraging customers to message them on WhatsApp.\nIt comes with a hefty price tag of up to £800 as several claim to be working with the DVLA ensuring it's legitimate.\nThe Daily Mail counted more than 20 accounts like this, with the fraudsters assuring that 'you won't have to do a thing' except hand over your provisional licence for them to make arrangements.\nIn one WhatsApp exchange seen by the Daily Mail, the scammer says it's £650 to obtain a full UK licence, including the theory, driving test and card itself.\nThey claimed it is carried out as an 'inside job' by someone working within the DVLA who will take the tests for you.\nAnother opportunist charged £700 and said 'we specialise in assisting individuals who have faced multiple challenges in passing their theory test or obtaining their full driving licence.' \nThey and several others claimed to work in the DVLA and so can make changes and updates directly within the database system, which should appear in three days.\n\nWould-be drivers are being fleeced out of hundreds of pounds by social media scammers promising to give them full UK licences - without ever having to do a test\n\nIt comes as the pass rate for driving theory tests is at its 'lowest point in history', according to a 2023 report\nA fourth account also charging £700 said the process takes up to seven days and they require a £300 deposit to secure your details in the DVLA database.\nBuyers are promised an easy win as they are told, 'you won't have to take any tests or lessons, we'll handle the entire process for you from start to finish'.\nOne man behind one of the accounts said a full licence would cost £590 and guaranteed everything is '100% legit' and 'fully registered on the DVLA database.'\nHe even asked to be referred to friends as 'client satisfaction is my main priority'.\nAlongside fake licences, some promise to lift bans for £600, which drivers can be legally prosecuted for.\nWhile the cost for a HGV licence can set you back £1200 and removal of penalty points are being priced at £200 for every three points.\nOne TikTok account has taken a clip of a girl that passed her driving test first time, but have captioned that she did it with no test.\nIt has raked up 120,000 views, with skeptical users asking in the comments 'is it real', 'how does this actually work' and 'is this legal'.\n\nThey claimed it is carried out as an 'inside job' by someone working within the DVLA who will take the tests for you\nBut hundreds of others are intrigued by the possibility of fast track success and have asked 'how much', 'how can I do it' and said 'I am interested'.\nIt comes as the pass rate for driving theory tests is at its 'lowest point in history', according to a 2023 report.\n\n Learner drivers being exploited by brokers charging over DOUBLE the price for earlier tests \nLearners' chances of passing their theory test dropped by a third since 2007/08 from 65.4 per cent to just 44.2 per cent in 2022/23.\nAverage driving theory test pass rates were generally between 60 and 65 per cent in the late 2000s, though changes introduced a decade ago sparked a sharp fall in pass rates to around 50 per cent.\nThese included an increase in questions, the withdrawal of interpreters and - likely having the biggest impact - the decision to stop publishing new theory test questions online or in practice papers.\nA DVLA spokesperson said: 'These accounts are not connected to DVLA and are recognised scams that attempt to obtain payment or personal information.\n'Anyone concerned they may have been a victim of a scam should contact the police through Action Fraud straight away.'\nNo evidence to date has been identified to suggest that DVLA staff are involved in such incidents.\n\nAlongside fake licences, some promise to lift bans and points for a fee of up to £600, which drivers can be legally prosecuted for\nAny documents received as a result of applying through these social media accounts will be counterfeit, they warned.\nWith the cost of lessons mounting and the threat of being pushed to the back of a queue if they fail, many learners see the shortcut as a cheaper alternative.\nAseem Munshi, Founder of financial firm Updraft, warns that economic strain on would-be drivers is what makes the scams more tempting.\nHe said: 'When people are under pressure, whether it's from rising costs or the fear of falling further behind in the driving test queue, they're more vulnerable to offers that promise a quick solution. \n'Scammers are clever at exploiting frustration, but the only safe and legal way to get a licence is to pass your test. No social media account can shortcut that process, and paying them could cost you far more in the long run.'\nMeanwhile Britain's learner drivers are facing the biggest backlog on record and are being exploited by dodgy brokers charging more than double the price for an earlier test.\n\nWith the cost of lessons mounting and the threat of being pushed to the back of a queue if they fail, many learners see the shortcut as a cheaper alternative\nEndless waiting lists as long as six months to sit practical tests means the slots have become hot commodities.\nGiven the huge demand, a driving test black market has been created as test bookings are now being sold at inflated prices of around £200 through third party websites, Facebook groups and WhatsApp.\nUnofficial broker companies are selling the appointments by using instructors' official Personal Reference Numbers to access available slots, then selling them at an extortionate price where they take the profit off the original fee.\nThe details are then changed to match that of the buyer. The service allows learners to get a test in a matter of days or weeks.\nWhatsappDVLATikTok\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nWannabe drivers who are buying fake UK licences from TIKTOK without ever taking a test are being scammed out of hundreds of pounds\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Why hasn’t the US?","text":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics or culture.\n\nJapan is expected to soon break ground that the United States has so far left intact. By mid-October, the East Asian country could be led by a woman.\n\nSanae Takaichi was elected on Oct. 4 to lead the Liberal Democratic Party, the right-wing governing party of Japan’s coalition government. For Takaichi to replace current Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who is resigning, she will need to win a vote in the country’s legislature. That is expected to happen, but some hurdles remain.\n\nIf Takaichi becomes the next prime minister, Japan would become the 50th democracy led by a woman since the end of World War II. Meanwhile, the U.S. would then become one of only 20 that has kept women out of national leadership.\n\nDaily Kos reviewed data from the Council on Foreign Relations on the history of elected or appointed female heads of state and government, among United Nations member nations, since the beginning of 1946. Daily Kos updated CFR’s data, which dated to Aug. 7, to be current as of this past Tuesday. Our analysis focuses only on nations that rank as a “flawed democracy” or better on the Economist Intelligence Group’s 2024 democracy index.\n\nThe U.S. position is even more stark among its economic peers, according to Daily Kos’ analysis.\n\nSince the end of World War II, 35 high-income democracies—defined by the World Bank as those with a gross national income of at least $13,935 per capita—have had a female head of state or government. If Takaichi ascends to the role of prime minister, Japan would become the 36th, leaving the U.S. as one of just eight led exclusively by men since 1946.\n\nBut what exactly is holding the U.S. back? \n\nSexism is no doubt a big reason. Forty percent of voters say they personally know someone who wouldn’t vote for a female presidential candidate, and 18% openly admit they themselves aren’t open to casting their presidential vote for a qualified woman. Nearly 80% of Americans blame gender discrimination for why there have been fewer women than men in higher office. \n\nSociety also encourages men more than women to seek higher office. And even when women do run, their candidacies face harsher media coverage. One analysis of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary discovered that female candidates suffered more gendered and even racialized media coverage than their male counterparts did, with coverage often criticizing the women for lacking “warmth.” Kamala Harris, last year’s Democratic nominee for president, faced the same misogynistic bias.\n\nBut sexism isn’t unique to America. As of early August, only 26 of 193 U.N. member nations had a female head of state or government, according to CFR. And only six had a national legislature composed of at least 50% women.\n\nIn some ways, the U.S. has actually been more inclusive than other democracies. A 2025 report by U.N. Women, the United Nations’ agency that promotes global gender equality, found the U.S. with a higher share of women in top governmental positions (40%) than Japan had (10%). The U.S. was also ahead of New Zealand (35%), Poland (35%), Denmark (30%), and other democracies that have had a female head of state or government.\n\nAnother key reason why America’s glass ceiling is intact is our electoral process itself.\n\nMany countries that have had female leaders use a parliamentary system, unlike the U.S., which has a presidential system. Under a typical parliamentary system, the head of government is usually the leader of the largest party in the government’s lower house, which is directly elected by voters. \n\nConsider Canada. In 1993, Kim Campbell became the nation’s first—and so far only—female prime minister. But Canadians didn’t directly elect her to the role in the way Americans elect their president. Instead, she won a much smaller vote at her party’s leadership convention, and because her Progressive Conservative Party was the governing party of Canada, she became prime minister. This is a somewhat similar process to how Takaichi is set to become Japan’s first female prime minister.\n\nHowever, America chooses its head of government via voting in a presidential election. This likely introduces a distinct level of scrutiny for candidates that isn’t faced in many other democracies that have had a female leader. \n\nAnd unlike in many other countries, if President Donald Trump were to pass away or resign or be removed from office, the Republican Party would not get together and vote on his replacement. Instead, Vice President JD Vance would immediately be sworn in. (God help us.)\n\nIf the U.S. had a parliamentary system, our head of government might be chosen by the House of Representatives, which would surely be much larger. For instance, the U.K.’s House of Commons has 650 seats for a national population of about 69.3 million—or one seat for every 107,000 people or so. Give the U.S. that same ratio, and the House would have over 3,200 seats. It currently has 435. \n\nA parliamentary system in the U.S. would no doubt mean more parties—and very possibly a female head of government. In fact, if the leader of the House functioned as the U.S. president, Nancy Pelosi would’ve broken the glass ceiling in 2007.\n\nNevertheless, another quirk of our current system has already stood in the way of the nation getting a female leader: the Electoral College. If the nation elected its president by a simple national popular vote, Hillary Clinton would have become president. In 2016, she beat Trump in the popular vote by over 2.8 million votes.\n\nDespite all of this, the U.S. is trending in the right direction. The number of women serving in Congress has rapidly increased over the past 30 years. And it’s very likely the momentum will eventually, maybe even in three short years, propel a woman into the Oval Office.\n\nAny updates?\n\n Pennsylvania Democrats may soon tap a better man than Democratic Sen. John Fetterman. Since taking office, Fetterman has undergone a startling political shift, drifting to the right of the voters who pushed him into office—and new polling suggests he will face hard headwinds in his 2028 Democratic primary, should he choose to run again. A recent Quinnipiac University poll finds that just 33% of state Democrats approve of the job he’s doing, while 54% disapprove. And while Republicans widely approve of the Democratic senator—62% approve, 21% disapprove—Keystone State Republicans can’t vote in Democratic primaries. And if Fetterman were to endeavor an independent run at retaining his seat, it’s unlikely Republican voters will back him over an actual Republican.\n\n As Trump needlessly deploys troops to Democrat-run cities, most of the American public doesn’t want the National Guard involved in controlling local crime. Fifty-three percent think local police departments would better address crime in their states, while just 6% think the National Guard would, according to YouGov. Another 28% think local police and the National Guard would do equally well.\n\n Conservative misinformation, is there anything it can’t do? Just under half of Republicans (42%) falsely believe that undocumented immigrants are eligible to receive Medicaid, according to new YouGov polling. Only 29% of Republicans know undocumented immigrants are ineligible.\n\n We already know Americans hate Trump’s tariffs, but new data finds that it’s changing their shopping habits. About 1 in 3 Americans who recently shopped secondhand say they’re doing so because of the tariffs, according to Morning Consult. Ironically for Trump, secondhand shopping is one way to combat the climate crisis, which he claims is a con job and a hoax.\n\nThe United States might soon lose its measles-free status, according to a United Nations agency on public health, as outbreaks continue to spread across the nation.\n\nAt least 1,563 measles cases have been reported so far in 2025, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data published on Wednesday. That makes for the most yearly cases since 1992, which was soon after major health organizations first started recommending a second dose of the vaccine to all children.\n\nBetween 2023 and 2024, the weekly average number of cases was just 3.3. In 2025, it’s 39.0.\n\nMeasles causes a blotchy rash and a high fever, along with a cough, a runny nose, and other symptoms. It is highly contagious and bears the most threat to children and those with compromised immune systems. Measles vaccination is estimated to have saved over 93 million lives across the world between 1974 and 2024.\n\nBut now vaccination rates are falling, cases have climbed this year, and at least three people have died.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. must be thrilled.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics or culture.\n\n\n\n\nJapan is expected to soon break ground that the United States has so far left intact.

Especially those who are fiercely critical of the Biden administration’s response to the war in Gaza.\n\nAt another point in the evening in Chicago, Harris was interrupted by hecklers blaming her and Biden’s stance on Gaza for her defeat to Trump. A similar episode played out in New York City, where Harris was repeatedly shouted over by protesters during an event in Times Square.\n\n“I understand your concern and how you feel — I think I do,” she told one heckler, according to PBS. “And the reality of it is where we are right now didn’t have to be this way — in terms of the blank check that this president has given [Israel].”\n\nWriting in 107 Days, the former vice president laid the blame for those decisions on Biden, claiming that she’d urged her former boss to show more public compassion for Palestinians. Campaign officials, meanwhile, disputed that there was ever daylight between the two politicians.\n\nAs she recovers politically from the defeat to Trump last year, many have questioned whether Harris will run again for public office. Earlier this year she said in a statement that she would not run for governor in California, her home state, in 2026.\n\nHarris has not ruled out serving in other settings as her party gears up for the next presidential election cycle in 2028. \n\nThough she hasn’t indicated any clear interest in running, her name has been floated as a potential contender for the Democratic nomination.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy BETHAN EDWARDS, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:22:55 BST, 12 October 2025 |Updated:23:43 BST, 12 October 2025 \n\nJeremy Clarkson has revealed he was rushed to hospital hours after branding the NHS a 'creaking old monster'. \nThe TV star, 65, needed 'urgent' medical treatment on October 5, at Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital after becoming 'poorly'. \nJeremy refused to disclose what he was treated for because 'that's none of your business' but he received treatment the same day as his Sunday Times column slated the health service was published.\nHe wrote: 'I needed urgent hospital treatment. The NHS was my only option.'\nThe Clarkson's Farm star called his treatment 'Defcon 1 painful' adding: 'They had to chisel me off the ceiling with a spatula afterwards. I was forced to stay the night, but it was OK.'\nJeremy continued: 'I genuinely couldn’t find anything to moan about at all. The doctors, the nurses and everyone I met were kind. It was all spotless. Lunch was kids’ food-brilliant, and they even made me better — for which I shall be eternally grateful.\n\nJeremy Clarkson has revealed he was rushed to hospital hours after branding the NHS a 'creaking old monster'\n\nThe TV star needed 'urgent' medical treatment on October 5, at Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital after becoming 'poorly'\n'And now I’m sure you’re expecting me to say I’ve changed my mind about the NHS. But I haven’t. Yes, it’s an excellent organisation and the frontline staff are superb. But in its current state, we as a nation cannot afford it.'\nIt comes after Jeremy has indeed been keeping a close eye on his health since his scare late last year.\nJeremy undergoes a medical MOT 'every couple of years', with his last check-up seeing him sit through 'eight solid hours of thoroughness'.\nHe shared that he underwent a cardiovascular and liver test, an ultrasound, MRI scan, none of which gave him any cause for concern until it came to the prostate exam.\nA prostate exam is where a doctor checks the prostate by inserting their finger into the rectum.\nAnd the former Top Gear star admitted that he couldn't understand how machines can 'spot what's happening in every part of your body, apart from your bottom'.\nHe wrote in an earlier column: 'They can photograph your ventricles and every bit of your brain, but if they want to know what's going on with your prostate, which lives in the anus, for some reason, the doctor has to put his finger in there. I can only assume it's because he likes it.'\nBut the TV star added that he knows the check is for his own good, and said he is happy doing the exam to make sure 'he's not going to drop dead in the morning'.\n\nJeremy refused to disclose what he was treated for because 'that's none of your business' but he received treatment the same day his Sunday Times column slated the health service \n\n Jeremy Clarkson fires back at accusations the Cotswolds has been 'ruined' by A-listers \nHe continued: 'The truth is, we do need to know this stuff. I've had too many friends go down with prostate cancer, and all it takes to get on top of the situation early is a moment or two of being a bit cross-eyed. You get the all-clear and the doc goes home happy. What's not to like?\n'I went home very happy, because the initial probing and photographing suggests all is well. And let me tell you, nothing makes you feel better than knowing for sure you're not going to drop dead tomorrow morning.'\nJeremy did however come terrifyingly close to death during the filming of Clarkson's Farm season four.\nAs he was working on the opening of The Farmer's Dog, he became 'more and more ill' before getting 'in a right panic' as he lost all of his sense of humour and 'ability to stay calm'.\nClarkson underwent an urgent two hour surgery to hold his arteries open, improve blood flow to his heart and relieve his chest pain.\nJeremy was told by doctors that 'a lot' of his current work will have 'to go', and suggested replacing it with golf.\nAlthough Jeremy said there was little chance he would stop working, he admitted his new diet was 'horrific' and the renowned meat-eater said he was struggling to 'make celery interesting'.\nSo he turned to Ozempic - used to treat diabetes - but it left him feeling unwell again and finished his use half a stone heavier than when he started.\nWriting in his column in The Times in March, he said: ''My body lost the ability to deal with gluttony but once the initial enthusiasm had worn off, my mind still wanted to breakfast on Cadbury Fruit & Nut.\n\nHe said: 'I’m sure you’re expecting me to say I’ve changed my mind about the NHS but I haven’t. Yes it’s an excellent organisation but in its current state we as a nation cannot afford it'\n\n'This meant I was sick a lot. And after I had vomited, I figured I was empty and could have another bottle and maybe another bar of chocolate too.'\n'Microdosing' Mounjaro has done the trick however, a drug which mimicks out hormones that help regulate appetite and blood sugar.\nJeremy has lost almost two stone and is now sporting a slimmer, healthier look - he insists that his girlfriend Lisa Hogan has 'given up' on making him look good however.\nJeremy told The Sun: 'Lisa's given up on trying to make me look presentable. I mean, I've never heard such nonsense. Trimming eyebrows? What does it matter? I'm 65, it's not like I'm David Gandy.'\nHe added: 'I lost about a stone and a half, maybe a little more, and then it's just levelled out now. I think I eat pretty well, I just drink too much - that's the essence of it.\n'If I could just do something about that, but then I think, \"what's the point?\"'\nTop GearJeremy ClarksonClarkson's FarmNHS\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJeremy Clarkson reveals he was rushed to hospital for 'urgent' medical treatment after branding the NHS as a 'creaking old monster'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The motivations behind the protests were unclear.\n\nNorris addressed the interruptions by telling the crowd: 'We encourage people to use their voices, but we want them to show respect for this woman.'\n\n'And please pronounce my name correctly,' quipped Harris, as spectators applauded their responses. \n\nThe Chicago event wasn't the first time Harris' book tour was hit by hecklers. \n\nSimilar scenes erupted during her appearance in Washington DC, when Harris was heckled about the US response to the Israel-Hamas conflict. \n\nWhen a protester began shouting about Gaza, Harris stood up and hit back at them, shouting: 'You know what, I am not president of the United States!' \n\nThe crowd again cheered as the heckler was removed by security. \n\nHarris launched the tour in late September to promote 107 Days, which recounts her 2024 campaign for the White House following Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race. \n\nIt offers a look at how decisions were made behind closed doors, and gives insight into tensions between some of the staffers involved in the campaign. \n\nHarris' memoir has sparked some criticism, even from people within Democrat circles. \n\nAn advisor to a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender slammed Harris' book while speaking anonymously with Politico last month. \n\n'At a time when people are looking for a vision and leadership… and want to see leaders rise to the level of threat facing the country, it's pretty crazy she chose to write a gossip book that prioritizes the pettiness of her politics,' they said. \n\nThe advisor added, 'It's embarrassing for her, and for all Democrats, considering she was the leader of the party less than a year ago.'\n\nFormer CNN journalist Chris Cillizza also gave the book a scathing review on Substack. \n\n'Harris' recent media tour to tout her memoir — '107 Days' — has reminded me of something I think I have long known: She is simply not a very good politician. And she hasn't gotten much better over her decades in the business,' he wrote. \n\nWriting on X, Cillizza also said that Harris' return to the stage has shown that 'she's not good on her feet'. 'She speaks in word salads,' he said. \n\nDemocratic strategist Gary South also told The Hill that Harris' book was defensive in tone. \n\n'She came out with arms flailing and guns blazing, blaming everyone but herself for her loss,' South said. \n\n'It is a curiously negative and ungracious tome for someone who reportedly thinks she can run again in 2028,' he added.","summary":"Security guards removed multiple people who interrupted a talk as part Harris' tour for her new memoir, 107 Days, amid chaos and screaming from the crowd.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15185053/Kamala-Harris-book-tour-protest-chicago-illinois-dc.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/12/21/102925889-0-image-m-21_1760301378579.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-12 21:02:30","author":"Editor,Laura Parnaby","authors":["Editor","Laura Parnaby"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.001},{"id":368639206,"title":"Trump’s purging of black officials makes latent racism official policy","text":"Back in 1986, when I was a first-year graduate student in theater arts at UCLA, a white professor called me into his office to break some bad news: The term paper I’d turned in wasn’t mine, he said. It was plagiarized. I was astonished. Of course the paper was mine. I had an undergraduate degree in English and had spent years writing term papers. I knew how to construct theses, build arguments, footnote and cite sources. And — quite unlike my fellow students — I liked the course and had participated enthusiastically in class discussions, something the professor seemed to genuinely appreciate. I assumed we had an understanding.\n\nAs it turns out, there was no “we.” Following his bombshell accusation, the professor told me only that “you don’t speak well” and couldn’t possibly have produced something so coherent. That was it. The way he said “you” repeatedly and pointedly, made it clear that he meant not just me, but all people like me. I realized that to him Black people could never ultimately measure up, even when they did. He had no proof of any plagiarism but he didn’t need any: He just knew. Here was racism in all its profound stupidity being expressed by a very educated man, at what was considered a liberal institution. I was thoroughly rattled but not surprised. Such overt bigotry that happened everywhere was the kind of bump in the road to justice that had been experienced by generations of Black people before me. I just happened to run into one now. \n\nIn 2025, the overt racism of the Trump administration is not just another bump in the road; it’s trying to end that road for good. The effort started on Trump’s day one executive orders eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and soon after, with the help of Elon Musk and DOGE, he began firing or forcing out Black people from government jobs, from career employees to agency heads to high-profile appointees. Among those summarily dismissed were the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., and Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, who was fired with a two-sentence email so terse that at first she thought it could be fake. Many who were replaced saw their jobs filled by white people with far less expertise or relevant experience.\n\nThis wasn’t the usual cleaning house that comes with a new administration, or about making government more efficient. What we may be reluctant to acknowledge even now is that these brutal dismissals are an expression of deep-rooted antiblackness that says Black people are never qualified to hold the jobs they have, whatever their actual qualifications. Unlike my professor 40 years ago, Trump and his minions are not remotely conscientious or empathetic (when I got up the courage to tell my professor his baseless accusation felt racist, he looked shocked, then uncomfortable). But the antiblack spirit is the same. And in the Trump era, it’s taking over at the highest levels of power. \n\nBut the takeover is having widespread and unprecedented consequences that, while alarming, are also not surprising. The national effort to diminish or entirely eliminate Black people from jobs and hard-fought positions of power and influence is undercutting not just the government that serves us all, but the entire American democratic experiment that has always rested on truly integrating its Black citizens. Martin Luther King Jr. famously said that whatever affects one of us affects us all because all Americans are “tied in a single garment of destiny.” It was a lofty ideal but also a warning that if we ultimately failed to see this interconnectedness, we as a country would fall. We are falling now. \n\nRelated | Librarian of Congress is latest casualty in Trump’s racist war on workers\n\nThe clearest evidence of that is how many other people have been sacrificed in the purging, notably the 80% of the federal workforce that isn’t Black but is expendable simply because they’re part of what Trump and other right-wing politicians have demonized as the “deep state.” That includes people from other communities who, like Black people, have been stigmatized for supposedly getting preferential treatment, including women, gay people, transgender people, Latinos and immigrants who have all felt the wrath of Trump’s fierce and sustained attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion. \n\nBut that scorched-earth anti-DEI campaign has always been a fig leaf for the larger mission, seeded 10 years ago when Trump became the Republican Party’s avatar, to terminate any and all efforts at racial justice, within the federal government but also within a host of other institutions: schools, nonprofits, workplaces, even health research organizations. Terminating all efforts at justice, however commonsense or even lifesaving, flows from that mission and always has. Trump is targeting public spaces for DEI cleansing, but private business is expected to follow suit (never mind that Republicans have historically been loath to let government set any kind of rules for the private sector.) \n\nThis is happening because Trump and his MAGA supporters see efforts at diversity and inclusion not as discrete programs, but a collective threat to white dominance everywhere, which must be preserved at all costs. The cruel and rampant job-cutting affirms that dominance, and sends the age-old message to Black people that they are inherently incompetent, that they do not deserve the job and never did. It also sends the message that white people are always in control of hiring, and can exercise that control at will. To Trump, it was only by the grace of “wokeness” that all these Black folks had jobs at all. What a layered irony that a word coined by Black folks to mean elevated consciousness and self-awareness has become MAGA-speak for misplaced white generosity towards fellow Americans they refuse to see as equals. A country that once largely saw itself as a democratic work-in-progress has become increasingly unrecognizable to me: a grotesque house of mirrors. \n\nWhile many Americans tarnished as DEI hires have suffered the unfair loss of jobs and careers, for Black people these attacks carry special significance. For African Americans, employment and justice have long been synonymous. After the end of the slavery, getting a toehold in a private labor market hostile to hiring Black people as anything other than maids and cooks was critical, and elusive. Jim Crow segregation laws that enforced the idea that Black people were not fit for real American society also had the effect of segregating work. It wasn’t until World War II that the federal government and taxpayer-funded contractors began hiring Black people in significant numbers — that is, hiring at scale. Lyndon Johnson signed an executive order in 1965 (nullified immediately by Trump in January) that called for racial fairness in federal contracting, in the wake of the significantly named March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. \n\nRelated | Inside Trump’s racist crusade to erase American heroes from US history\n\nBut this modest progress came at a cost. White resentment of the federal government’s role in aiding Black people that began during Reconstruction simmered for decades after the 1960s, heating up during the Reagan and both Bush administrations and finally boiling over what we have now — a federal government that isn’t just not hiring Black people, it’s openly working to erase the history of Black struggle and achievement altogether. Charles Q. Brown Jr., the former chair of the Joint Chiefs, was canned partly because in 2020, after the murder of George Floyd that outraged people across color lines, he was moved to comment about his own experiences with racism in his rise to the top — his bumps in the road. In the antiblack era of Trump 2.0, such reflection constitutes a fireable offense.\n\nMAGA’s logic seems to be that since virtually all Black people have stories like Brown’s — stories that impugn America’s greatness — they are not fit for any positions, especially those of influence and authority. Trump’s Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who himself lacked the qualifications of his Biden administration (and Black) predecessor Lloyd Austin, had been transparent in his disdain for an accomplished Black leader. Last November, Hegseth said that Brown had to be fired because any general “that was involved in any of that DEI woke shit has got to go.” Last month, in a speech that felt like a culmination of months of the Trump administration’s racial animus meant to break not just American institutions but American culture, he told hundreds of top military officials that the Trump administration had worked since day one “to remove the social justice, politically correct and toxic ideological garbage that had infected our department” and called the idea that diversity is our strength an “insane fallacy.”\n\nUnderpinning the new racism cast as anti-DEI is its intellectual laziness — its rank stupidity. Calling leaders of color who simply support diversity the “woke radical left,” a stock smear within the GOP, is absurd on its face. Racism is always rooted in fear and unreason, of course, a prime example of intellectual laziness. It’s the foundation of Trump’s bigger war on intellect and reason in America, and it’s worked. When he accused President Barack Obama of not being born in America back in 2009 — suggesting the nation’s first Black president didn’t qualify for the job because of his color — there was some outcry but plenty of takers. That pernicious lie laid the foundation for many other attacks on Black Americans that have become Trump’s hallmark as president, including his speculation earlier this year that a plane crash in D.C. was caused by DEI, or his more recent call to prosecute Beyoncé for allegedly being paid millions to endorse Kamala Harris (she wasn’t). \n\nThe total lack of shame these days around antiblackness within a GOP that has capitulated to Trump, our elected officials’ willingness to make knee-jerk bigotry a pillar of politics and of daily life, is dispiriting, to say the least. It’s also terrifying because it marries the mercurial stupidity of racism with real power to enact it. The Confederacy only controlled the South; Trump, who is restoring a Confederate monument to the nation’s capital, seeks to control the whole country. And virtually his entire party seems to approve. \n\nIn this distressing reality there is a truth that qualifies as a ray of hope. In continually discrediting Blackness, Trump and his MAGA base continually remind us of the opposite: that Black people, far from being inferior or separate from other Americans, have long been the moral vanguard for the entire country. The post-slavery fight for Black equality led by Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. DuBois and others was from the beginning a fight for a free America articulated in the Constitution and venerated over generations by leaders of all colors and all causes. The Black fight for a more just and compassionate nation, starting with the fight for jobs commensurate with their talents, positions they more than earned and had every right to keep, is nothing less than America’s fight for its own claims on democracy and that nebulous but still-essential thing called the American dream.\n\nAfter the rude awakening with my professor in 1986, I fought for that dream by holding my ground, insisting he was wrong and that the work I’d given him was mine. He gave me an oral quiz on the thesis, which I easily passed, and he finally gave me an A, albeit reluctantly. He hadn’t changed his mind about me, or about Black students. I had won a battle but hardly the war.\n\nStill, I remained optimistic. I told myself that this was only one setback, that there would be more chances to prove myself to different professors and potential employers down the road that was many miles long. This was America; for all its troubling history, I believed in the breadth of opportunities unique to such a wealthy country whose great diversity was part of that wealth, opportunities that would always offset the hypocrisies. Black struggle would keep the good tension going, the democratic experiment in play, and Black people would finally overcome. I don’t believe that anymore.","summary":"President Trump’s firings send a clear message that white mediocrity is always preferable to Black achievement.\n\n\n\nBy Erin Aubry Kaplan for Capital &amp; Main\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in 1986, when I was a first-year graduate student in theater arts at UCLA, a white professor called me into his office to break some bad news: The term paper I’d turned in wasn’t mine, he said.

Doctors discovered a small nodule on his prostate, leading to the diagnosis.\n\nAt the time, Biden’s office stated: “He was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone.” \n\nThe statement added: \n\n“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management.”\n\nCancer Research UK notes that a Gleason score of nine indicates a “high-grade” cancer, meaning the cells are likely to spread rapidly.\n\nBiden’s health history and public life\n\nBiden, who left office in January as the oldest serving US president in history, faced persistent scrutiny over his health during his first term.\n\nHe ultimately withdrew from the 2024 presidential race late in his campaign, a decision he described as “difficult” during a BBC interview in May, his first since leaving the White House.\n\nHis former Vice-President, Kamala Harris, ran in his place as the Democratic candidate but was defeated by current President Donald Trump.\n\nThe former president has long championed cancer research. In 2022, he and his wife Jill Biden relaunched the “cancer moonshot” initiative, aiming to prevent over four million cancer deaths by 2047.\n\nBiden’s advocacy is deeply personal; he lost his eldest son, Beau, to brain cancer in 2015 and has himself been treated for skin cancer twice, in 2023 and 2025.\n\nIn recent months, Biden has largely stepped back from public life.\n\nProstate cancer: Common threat to men’s health\n\nProstate cancer remains the second most common cancer affecting men, following skin cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. \n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 13 out of every 100 men will develop prostate cancer during their lifetime, with age being the most significant risk factor.\n\nBiden’s ongoing treatment highlights the challenges of managing advanced prostate cancer and underscores the importance of early detection and continued research.\n\nJoe Biden’s legacy\n\nJoe Biden is a veteran American politician who served as the 46th President of the United States from 2021 to 2025, following eight years as Vice-President under Barack Obama. \n\nKnown for his long-standing career in public service, Biden has been a vocal advocate for cancer research, especially after losing his son Beau to brain cancer in 2015.\n\nIn 2022, he relaunched the “cancer moonshot” initiative with his wife Jill Biden. After stepping down from the 2024 presidential race, Biden has largely retreated from public life.\n\nJoe Biden diagnosed with aggressive cancer\n\nLegit.ng earlier reported that Former US President Joe Biden was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, according to a statement from his office on Sunday, May 18, 2025.\n\nThe statement said the cancer has spread to his bones, raising concerns about the severity of his condition, CNN confirmed. Last week, Joe Biden underwent a medical evaluation after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms.\n\nAccording to his office, a new prostate nodule was detected, leading to further examination.

Yet you wouldn't know it from listening to President Donald Trump or even some of the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve.\n\nTrump told the United Nations General Assembly late last month: “Grocery prices are down, mortgage rates are down, and inflation has been defeated.”\n\nAnd at a high-profile speech in August, just before the Fed cut its key interest rate for the first time this year, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said: “Inflation, though still somewhat elevated, has come down a great deal from its post-pandemic highs. Upside risks to inflation have diminished.”\n\nYet dismissing or even downplaying inflation while it is still above the Fed's target of 2% poses big risks for the White House and the Federal Reserve. For the Trump administration, it could find itself on the wrong side of a potent issue: Surveys show that many Americans still see high prices as a major burden on their finances.\n\nThe Fed may be taking an even bigger gamble: It has cut its key interest rate on the assumption that the Trump administration's tariffs will only cause a temporary bump up in inflation. If that turns out to be wrong — if inflation gets worse or remains elevated for longer than expected — the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility could take a hit.\n\nThat credibility plays a crucial role in the Fed's ability to keep prices stable. If Americans are confident that the central bank can keep inflation in check, they won't take steps — such as demanding sharply higher pay when prices rise — that can launch an inflationary spiral. Companies often increase prices further to offset higher labor costs.\n\nBut Karen Dynan, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said this week that with memories of pandemic-era inflation still fresh and tariffs pushing up the cost of imported goods, consumers and businesses could start to lose confidence that inflation will stay low.\n\n“If that proves to be the case, in hindsight it will be that the Fed cuts -- and I do expect several more -- are going to be seen as a mistake,” Dynan said.\n\nSo far, the Trump administration's tariffs haven't lifted inflation as much as as many economists expected earlier this year. And it remains far below its 9.1% peak three years ago. Still, consumer prices increased 2.9% in August from a year earlier, up from 2.6% at the same time last year and above the Fed’s 2% target.\n\nThe government is scheduled to release the September inflation report on Wednesday, but the data will probably be delayed by the government shutdown.\n\nTariffs have pushed up the cost of many imported items, including furniture, appliances, and toys. Overall, the cost of long-lasting manufactured goods rose nearly 2% in August from a year earlier. It was a modest gain, but comes after nearly three decades when the cost of such items mostly fell.\n\nThe cost of some everyday goods are still rising more quickly than before the pandemic: Grocery prices moved up 2.7% in August from a year ago, the largest gain, outside the pandemic, since 2015. Coffee prices have soared nearly 21% in the past year, partly because Trump has slapped 50% import taxes on Brazil, a leading coffee exporter, and also because climate change-induced droughts have cut into coffee bean harvests.\n\nMost Fed officials are still concerned that inflation is too high, according the minutes of its Sept. 16-17 meeting. Yet they still chose to cut their key interest rate, because they were more worried about the risk of worsening unemployment than about higher inflation.\n\nBut the concern for some economists is that the ongoing rollout of tariffs and the fact that many companies are still implementing price hikes in response could result in more than just a temporary boost to inflation.\n\n“It is a big gamble after what we’ve been going through ... to count on it being transitory,” said Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University and a former top adviser to President Barack Obama. “Once upon a time, (3% inflation) would have been considered really high.”\n\nJust two weeks ago, Trump slapped new tariffs on a range of products, including 100% on pharmaceuticals, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and 25% on heavy trucks. On Friday, he threatened “a massive increase of tariffs” on imports from China in response to that country's restrictions on rare earth exports.\n\nSome companies are still raising prices to offset the tariff costs. Duties on steel and aluminum imports have pushed up the cost of the cans used by Campbell Soups, leading the company’s CEO to say in September that it will implement “surgical pricing initiatives.\"\n\nChris Butler, CEO of National Tree Company, the nation’s largest artificial Christmas tree seller, says his company will raise prices by about 10% this holiday season on its trees, wreaths, and garlands to offset tariff costs. About 45% of its trees are made in China, with the rest from Southeast Asia, Mexico, and other countries. The cost of labor and real estate is too high to make them in the United States, he said.\n\nButler also expects there will be a reduced supply of artificial trees and decorations this year, which could lift industry-wide prices further, because most production in China shut down when tariffs on that country hit 145% earlier this year. Production resumed after Trump reduced the duties to 30% but at a slower pace.\n\nButler has pushed his suppliers to absorb some of the cost of the tariffs, but they won’t pay all of it.\n\n“At the end of the day, we can’t absorb the entirety of it and our factories can’t absorb the entirety of it,” he said. “So we’ve had to pass along some of the increases to consumers.”\n\nMany Fed policymakers are aware of the risks. Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who votes on interest rate decisions, said Monday that high inflation that results from a loss of confidence in the central bank is harder to fight than other price spikes, such as those that result from supply disruptions.\n\n“The Fed must maintain its credibility on inflation,” Schmid said. “History has shown that while all inflations are universally disliked, not all inflations are equally costly to fight.”\n\nYet some Fed officials say that other trends are offsetting the impact of tariffs. Fed governor Stephen Miran, whom Trump appointed just before the central bank’s September meeting, said Tuesday that a steady slowdown in rental costs should reduce underlying inflation in the coming months. And the sharp drop in immigration as a result of the administration’s clampdown will reduce demand, he said, cooling inflation pressures.\n\n“I’m more sanguine about the inflation outlook than a lot of other people are,” he said.","summary":"Inflation has risen in three of the last four months and is slightly higher than it was a year ago, when it helped sink then-Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.

Andy Barr, R-Ky., said he is the only Senate candidate in Kentucky with the \"America First\" record and experience necessary to keep the state’s open Senate seat red as Sen. Mitch McConnell’s 40-year tenure comes to an end. After serving seven terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, Barr is running to replace McConnell in the Senate, as the former party leader retires next year. With Amy McGrath announcing her campaign for the Democratic nomination this week, Barr is also gearing up for a potential rematch. \"I relish the opportunity of a rematch, especially statewide, where the electorate is far more conservative than the swing district where I have represented the last seven terms,\" Barr told Fox News Digital. McGrath unsuccessfully challenged Barr for Kentucky's 6th Congressional District in 2018. She later lost to McConnell when she ran for his Senate seat in 2020. TRUMP-BACKED CANDIDATE WINS CROWDED GOP PRIMARY IN BATTLE FOR VACANT HOUSE SEAT \"She's a proven loser,\" Barr said. \"She has lit Democrat donor money on fire twice, and I've even seen Democrats lament the fact that she's retreading her old messages. She is a stale candidate, and I think there's a fatigue factor with Amy McGrath.\" DEM SHELLACKED BY MCCONNELL IN 2020 MOUNTS NEW SENATE BID: 'COWARDS IN WASHINGTON ARE BOWING TO DONALD TRUMP' Despite the criticism, Barr admitted that McGrath is the \"darling of the far, extreme left\" with a unique fundraising record, so it would not surprise him if Democrats nominated her to run for the open Senate seat. \"I'm the only candidate in this U.S. Senate race who has a proven record of defeating Amy McGrath and her fundraising in the one swing, purple district. If you want to block her path, if you want to defeat Democrats in Kentucky, nominate the guy who has a proven record of defeating Amy McGrath,\" Barr said. Barr defeated McGrath by just over three percentage points in 2018, despite the former Marine fighter pilot reportedly raising nearly twice as much money as him. Barr described himself as an \"America First, pro-Trump Republican member of Congress,\" who values limited government, free enterprise and strong national defense. Barr told Fox News Digital that he is the only candidate in the race with experience delivering on President Donald Trump's agenda. Former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron and businessman Nate Morris are among those vying for the Republican nomination for Kentucky's open Senate seat. \"The Kentucky Republican Party is ascendant in the wake of Senator McConnell's 40 years in office,\" Barr said, telling Fox News Digital that Kentucky's electorate has shifted to the right since McGrath's last two races. \"The electorate is even more conservative in Kentucky, more pro-Trump than it was when she ran those first two races, first against me in 2018 and then against Mitch McConnell in 2020. The people of Kentucky have rejected those extreme, far-liberal views,\" he said. Trump won Kentucky by more than 30 points last year. While former Vice President Kamala Harris won Fayette County, which includes Lexington and is part of the 6th Congressional District, by 18 percentage points in 2024, Barr won his re-election by 26 points. Barr is one of just three House Republicans who won districts that Harris carried in 2024. \"Everyone knows that Daniel Cameron is the frontrunner in this race. You’re essentially lighting your money on fire if you give it to Andy Barr,\" Cameron's campaign fired back when reached for comment, arguing that Cameron is the \"America First\" candidate.

Bringing together more than 500 television creators and 150 top digital storytellers, alongside leaders in philanthropy, advocacy, and government, it was a day of inspiration - and provocation.\n\nCo-chaired by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Greg Berlanti, and Kerry Washington with her producing partner Pilar Savone, the summit — hosted by Propper Daley x BPI, and Invisible Hand — brought together some of Hollywood’s most thoughtful voices for a single day designed to “push, stretch, and grow.” The result was part symposium, part revival, part therapy session for a storytelling industry searching for truth in a time of uncertainty.\n\nJay Shetty at ADOUC2025 - credit Lindsay Rosenberg\nLNZYROSEPHOTO / LINDSAY ROSENBERG PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nThe program was hosted by Atsuko Okatsuka and included conversations with Former White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, Kerry Washington, Paul “Triple H” Levesque, Hasan Piker, Aaron Parnas, Jay Shetty, Phil Rosenthal, Sara Gilbert, Terry Crews, Eddie Huang, Mara Brock Akil, Vic Blends, Nabela Noor, Congressman Adam Kinzinger, Greg Berlanti, Todd Rose, Don Cheadle, Brittany Hugoboom, Sarah Longwell, Jessica Yellin, Jake Shane, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and many more, plus performances by Ruby Ibarra and Linda Perry.\n\nMichele L. Jawando, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tomicah Tillemann at ADOUC2025 - credit Lindsay Rosenberg\nLNZYROSEPHOTO / LINDSAY ROSENBERG PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nWashington set the tone early, reminding us that “good storytelling doesn’t live in the binary.” In an era where social media feeds us more of what we already believe, she challenged creators to “step into the complexity” — because empathy, not certainty, is the real superpower.\n\nThe day explored how power, technology, and culture intersect—from Jay Shetty’s reflections on algorithms and morality to Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s call for digital self-ownership. Conversations spanned generational and cultural divides: Kerry Washington examined parenting in the social media age; Don Cheadle , Anna Jane Joyner and her father Rick Joyner who modeled dialogue across climate and faith; and Terry Crews and Vicblends redefined masculinity through vulnerability and care.\n\nTerry Cruise and Vicblends at A Day of Unreasonable Conversation 2025\nLNZYROSEPHOTO / LINDSAY ROSENBERG PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nPanels on democracy, equality, and representation challenged participants to confront misinformation, reclaim empathy, and reimagine leadership. Through humor, courage, and candor, speakers like W. Kamau Bell, Liz Plank, and Nicole Maines reminded audiences that hope and truth are acts of defiance in divisive times. The summit became a powerful reminder that storytelling itself is an instrument of social transformation.\n\nAnd then, as the sun dipped over the Pacific, Vice President Kamala Harris took the stage and blew the roof off the place.\n\nKamala Harris at ADOUC2025 - credit Lindsay Rosenberg\nLNZYROSEPHOTO / LINDSAY ROSENBERG PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nSpeaking with WNBA star Napheesa Collier, Harris shared her reflections on grief, resilience, and leadership — and dropped what will undoubtedly go down as one of the great unscripted lines of the year: “There is so much about this moment that is trying to make people feel like they’ve lost their minds — when in fact, these motherf***ers are crazy.” The room erupted, not because it was shocking, but because it was real. It was the sound of a leader reclaiming her voice in an age that rewards silence.\n\nHarris said the event was part of her “Freedom Tour,” and in many ways, that phrase captured the spirit of the event. Freedom to think out loud. Freedom to disagree with grace. Freedom to imagine a future not defined by fear.\n\nTriple H and Joe Tessitore at ADOUC2025 - credit Lindsay Rosenberg\nLNZYROSEPHOTO / LINDSAY ROSENBERG PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nWhat made A Day of Unreasonable Conversation so powerful wasn’t just the celebrities or the setting. It was the sincerity in the invitation to have conversations with people whose views maybe very different to ours - whether it was Triple H speaking about his passion for helping our kids health or Rick Joyner’s views on climate change . In a time when the world feels increasingly polarized, it was heartening to see storytellers — the people who shape culture’s mirror — come together to recognize that while there are things that divide us, there’s more that unites us.\n\nI left The Getty with one thought echoing in my mind: maybe what the world needs most right now isn’t another reasonable conversation — it’s an unreasonable one. The kind that breaks your heart open, helps you see differently, and reminds you why stories still matter. Because stories are the only thing big enough to fill the hope gap in our world today - and spark the urgent action we need to take.\n\nA Day of Unreasonable Conversation is a program of Propper Daley | BPI in partnership with Invisible Hand, and presented by Imaginable Futures in partnership with Omidyar Network, Stand Together, and Imagine Entertainment, with additional support from New America, Carnegie Corporation of New York, Knight Foundation, Conrad N.

Yet you wouldn't know it from listening to President Donald Trump or even some of the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve.Trump told the United Nations General Assembly late last month: “Grocery prices are down, mortgage rates are down, and inflation has been defeated.”And at a high-profile speech in August, just before the Fed cut its key interest rate for the first time this year, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said: “Inflation, though still somewhat elevated, has come down a great deal from its post-pandemic highs. Upside risks to inflation have diminished.”IN RELATED NEWS | Rising inflation and weakening job market raise fears of stagflationYet dismissing or even downplaying inflation while it is still above the Fed's target of 2% poses big risks for the White House and the Federal Reserve. For the Trump administration, it could find itself on the wrong side of a potent issue: Surveys show that many Americans still see high prices as a major burden on their finances.The Fed may be taking an even bigger gamble: It has cut its key interest rate on the assumption that the Trump administration's tariffs will only cause a temporary bump up in inflation. If that turns out to be wrong — if inflation gets worse or remains elevated for longer than expected — the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility could take a hit.That credibility plays a crucial role in the Fed's ability to keep prices stable. If Americans are confident that the central bank can keep inflation in check, they won't take steps — such as demanding sharply higher pay when prices rise — that can launch an inflationary spiral. Companies often increase prices further to offset higher labor costs.But Karen Dynan, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said this week that with memories of pandemic-era inflation still fresh and tariffs pushing up the cost of imported goods, consumers and businesses could start to lose confidence that inflation will stay low.“If that proves to be the case, in hindsight it will be that the Fed cuts -- and I do expect several more -- are going to be seen as a mistake,” Dynan said.So far, the Trump administration's tariffs haven't lifted inflation as much as as many economists expected earlier this year. And it remains far below its 9.1% peak three years ago. Still, consumer prices increased 2.9% in August from a year earlier, up from 2.6% at the same time last year and above the Fed’s 2% target.The government is scheduled to release the September inflation report on Wednesday, but the data will probably be delayed by the government shutdown.Tariffs have pushed up the cost of many imported items, including furniture, appliances, and toys. Overall, the cost of long-lasting manufactured goods rose nearly 2% in August from a year earlier. It was a modest gain, but comes after nearly three decades when the cost of such items mostly fell.The cost of some everyday goods are still rising more quickly than before the pandemic: Grocery prices moved up 2.7% in August from a year ago, the largest gain, outside the pandemic, since 2015. Coffee prices have soared nearly 21% in the past year, partly because Trump has slapped 50% import taxes on Brazil, a leading coffee exporter, and also because climate change-induced droughts have cut into coffee bean harvests.IN CASE YOU MISSED IT | Wall Street drops to its worst day since April after Trump's threats of tariffs shatter its calmMost Fed officials are still concerned that inflation is too high, according the minutes of its Sept. 16-17 meeting. Yet they still chose to cut their key interest rate, because they were more worried about the risk of worsening unemployment than about higher inflation.But the concern for some economists is that the ongoing rollout of tariffs and the fact that many companies are still implementing price hikes in response could result in more than just a temporary boost to inflation.“It is a big gamble after what we’ve been going through ... to count on it being transitory,” said Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University and a former top adviser to President Barack Obama. “Once upon a time, (3% inflation) would have been considered really high.”Just two weeks ago, Trump slapped new tariffs on a range of products, including 100% on pharmaceuticals, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and 25% on heavy trucks. On Friday, he threatened “a massive increase of tariffs” on imports from China in response to that country's restrictions on rare earth exports.Some companies are still raising prices to offset the tariff costs. Duties on steel and aluminum imports have pushed up the cost of the cans used by Campbell Soups, leading the company’s CEO to say in September that it will implement “surgical pricing initiatives.\"Chris Butler, CEO of National Tree Company, the nation’s largest artificial Christmas tree seller, says his company will raise prices by about 10% this holiday season on its trees, wreaths, and garlands to offset tariff costs. About 45% of its trees are made in China, with the rest from Southeast Asia, Mexico, and other countries. The cost of labor and real estate is too high to make them in the United States, he said.Butler also expects there will be a reduced supply of artificial trees and decorations this year, which could lift industry-wide prices further, because most production in China shut down when tariffs on that country hit 145% earlier this year. Production resumed after Trump reduced the duties to 30% but at a slower pace.Butler has pushed his suppliers to absorb some of the cost of the tariffs, but they won’t pay all of it.“At the end of the day, we can’t absorb the entirety of it and our factories can’t absorb the entirety of it,” he said. “So we’ve had to pass along some of the increases to consumers.”Many Fed policymakers are aware of the risks. Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who votes on interest rate decisions, said Monday that high inflation that results from a loss of confidence in the central bank is harder to fight than other price spikes, such as those that result from supply disruptions.“The Fed must maintain its credibility on inflation,” Schmid said. “History has shown that while all inflations are universally disliked, not all inflations are equally costly to fight.”Yet some Fed officials say that other trends are offsetting the impact of tariffs. Fed governor Stephen Miran, whom Trump appointed just before the central bank’s September meeting, said Tuesday that a steady slowdown in rental costs should reduce underlying inflation in the coming months. And the sharp drop in immigration as a result of the administration’s clampdown will reduce demand, he said, cooling inflation pressures.“I’m more sanguine about the inflation outlook than a lot of other people are,” he said.","summary":"Inflation has risen in three of the last four months and is slightly higher than it was a year ago.

Miles Coleman, associate editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, told Newsweek. “With that, it’s not too surprising to me that Trump’s approval there, -9, is roughly in line with where he is nationally.”\n\nTrump’s highest favorability was recorded in the Northeast (47 percent favorable, 43 percent unfavorable) — an unexpected result for one of the nation’s most liberal regions. He also performed well in the South (46 percent favorable, 43 percent unfavorable), where Republican registration remains strong.\n\nThe West was Trump’s least favorable region, with 38 percent viewing him positively and 50 percent negatively.\n\nThe Midwest at the Heart of Trump’s 2024 Strategy\n\nThe Midwest was central to Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign. He won eight of the 12 Midwestern states, flipping both Michigan and Wisconsin — two states he had narrowly lost in 2020. In Wisconsin, Trump won 49.6 percent of the vote to Kamala Harris’s 48.7 percent, while in Michigan he became the first Republican to carry the state twice since Ronald Reagan.\n\nHis choice of Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate underscored the region’s political importance. Announcing the pick, Trump said Vance “will be strongly focused on … the American Workers and Farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond.”\n\nAt the time, Anthony Zurcher, the BBC’s North America correspondent, wrote that “the pick suggests Trump knows this election will be won and lost in a handful of industrial Midwest battleground states.”\n\nAnd ahead of that announcement, Angelia Wilson, a politics professor at the University of Manchester, England, told Newsweek: “Any reasonable political strategy points to Vance and the need to ensure a solid win in Ohio and the Rustbelt.”\n\nTrump’s Midwest Promise\n\nThroughout the 2024 campaign, Trump returned repeatedly to the theme that only he could restore the region’s lost industrial power. In Saginaw, Michigan, he vowed to make the state once again the “car capital of the world,” blasting what he called “energy policies that are stripping jobs” from American workers. “Michigan, more than any other state, has lost 60 percent of your automobile business over the years,” he said.\n\nIn Mosinee, Wisconsin, Trump leaned on trade threats as a key policy tool. Speaking at a rally, he warned of “unprecedented tariffs” against foreign competitors and argued that immigrants were displacing U.S. workers — framing his agenda as a defense of the industrial Midwest, Reuters reported.\n\nAnd in one of his most direct economic moves, Trump threatened 200 percent tariffs on John Deere if the agricultural giant shifted production to Mexico, a signal to Midwestern manufacturers that his “America First” stance still applied to them.\n\nTariffs, Inflation, and the New Economic Anxiety\n\nBut while Trump’s message of protectionism once resonated deeply across the Midwest, cracks are beginning to show. Many farmers and manufacturers are now feeling the pinch of tariffs that have reduced exports and driven down crop prices.\n\n“There have been constant headlines of farmers being caught in the middle of Trump’s tariff fights, so that might be an especially salient issue in the Midwest,” Coleman said.\n\nTrump has dramatically expanded U.S. tariffs since returning to office, marking one of the most sweeping protectionist shifts in decades. In February 2025, he imposed new duties of 25 percent on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10 percent on Chinese imports, citing national security concerns related to drug trafficking and border security, according to a White House fact sheet.\n\nTwo months later, Trump issued Executive Order 14257, known as “Liberation Day,” introducing a 10 percent baseline tariff on nearly all imports and authorizing higher duties — in some cases up to 50 percent — on goods from countries accused of unfair trade practices. The order also revoked the de minimis exemption that had allowed low-value imports to enter the U.S. tariff-free, and expanded tariffs under existing laws such as Section 232 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The measures targeted key industries including autos, steel and aluminum.\n\nThe administra...","summary":"Trump&#039;s favorability rating in the Midwest is one of his weakest showings nationwide in a new poll.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/the-midwest-has-turned-on-trump-10860327","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Midwest-Has-Turned-on-Trump.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-12 10:38:44","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.075},{"id":368487094,"title":"Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi's English neighbours reveal all about their new life in Cotswolds after couple fled the United States following Donald Trump's reelection","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nHome and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Oct 12th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMosque in uber-liberal London enclave bans all females over 12 from charity park run... so where are the howls of outrage from the Wokerati?\n\n'I'm surprised it took so long for him to be killed': How paedophile Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins had a 'target on his back while in prison'\n\nDiane Keaton cuddles up to her dog in last photo before she died aged 79\n\nAged 43, I've enough in my pension to last just TWO years - despite being careful with money, says JOE MINIHANE.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JASON CHESTER, ASSISTANT SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:08:51 BST, 12 October 2025 |Updated:09:07 BST, 12 October 2025 \n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia De Rossi are said to be embracing life in the English countryside after relocating to the United Kingdom more than a year ago. \nFormer talk show host DeGeneres and her actress wife have traded their glamorous lives in southern California for a more sedate way of life in the Cotswolds, where they own a 43-acre farmstead. \nAnd locals say the American couple have adjusted well to country life since moving to the property, located on the outskirts of Oxfordshire town Witney, last November, and often mix with neighbours in local pub The Farmer's Dog. \nA source told People: 'They come in regularly, they are really chilled and very polite. They come in with their dogs, sometimes on their own and sometimes with other people.\n'One time, they asked to sit at the corner table presumably as it’s a bit more private. Everyone knows who she is, but they don’t bother her.' \nDeGeneres, 67, and De Rossi moved to Kitesbridge Farm in the Cotswolds after Donald Trump won an unprecedented second US presidency in 2024 - citing his reelection as a primary reason for the move. \n\nView gallery\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi are embracing life in the English countryside after relocating to the UK more than a year ago (pictured in local pub The Farmer's Dog)\n\nView gallery\n\nFormer talk show host DeGeneres and her actress wife have traded their lives in southern California for a more sedate way of life in the Cotswolds, where they own a 43-acre farmstead\n\nCurtain comes down on Ralph Fiennes' swipe at his ex-wife Alex\n\n10.6k viewing now\n\nEye-popping pictures prove Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau ARE a couple\n\n62k viewing now\n\nDiane Keaton cuddles up to her dog in last photo before her death\n\n14.4k viewing now\n\nBut DeGeneres had also suffered a very public fall from grace following claims from multiple employees on her former talk show that she had helped to foster a 'toxic workplace'.\nThe source added: '[Ellen's] so nice and very down to earth. It's a small village so of course everyone gossips, but I haven't heard a single bad thing.' \nA second local told the publication: 'They were [at our pub] for about an hour or so last year and were discreet. They had a drink and left, no fuss.' \nIt's understood that the married couple became 'very disillusioned' after Trump claimed a second stint in the White House, with sources claiming they vowed to 'to get the hell out' of the US as a result, according to TMZ.\nThe publication notes that DeGeneres was among former Vice President Kamala Harris' high-profile celebrity donors.\nShe donated $3,300 to the losing Democratic candidate, which is the maximum amount that can be donated directly to a candidate, though wealthy donors often get around the contribution limits by donating much more to political action committees and super PACs.\nThe TV personality's career was tarnished by accusations that she fostered a toxic workplace on the set of her eponymous daytime talk show, which aired its last episode on May 26, 2022.\nShe delved into her persona non grata status on her stand-up special For Your Approval, which was released on Netflix in late September.\n\nView gallery\n\nDeGeneres and de Rossi listed their Bali-inspired mansion in Montecito, California, ahead of their move to the UK.

Star is demanding £22.5m for farm \nThe comedian joked that she had been 'kicked out of show business' in the special, which featured material about how she has been spending her time since the end of her TV show.\nDeGeneres and de Rossi arrived in Britain the day before Trump was elected for his second term, which she said was received poorly by her friends – all of whom texted her with 'crying emojis', she later disclosed. \nAnd their farm has a lot to offer, including a sweeping kitchen, bespoke solid wood furniture, dressing rooms, marble–clad en suites, a two–bed guest cottage, indoor swimming pool, helipad and a five–car garage inside a converted granary barn. \n'We’re just not used to seeing this kind of beauty,' she told broadcaster Richard Bacon during an event in Cheltenham in July.\n\nView gallery\n\nDeGeneres suffered a very public fall from grace following claims from multiple employees on her former talk show that she had helped to foster a 'toxic workplace'\n\nView gallery\n\nDeGeneres and de Rossi have since relocated to a new–build that her estate agent admitted looked as if it belonged in Malibu\n'The villages and the towns and the architecture – everything you see is charming, and it’s just a simpler way of life. I just love it here.'\nBut a year after snapping it up, Kitesbridge was already back on the market – with the asking price hiked from £15m to a cool £22.5m. The bulk of the uplift is said to cover what she spent on renovations.\nDeGeneres and de Rossi have since relocated to a new–build that her estate agent admitted looked as if it belonged in Malibu.\n'We decided we needed a different house, and now we are selling that house,' she told an audience at an event in July.\n'So if anyone wants a house, it's a beautiful stone farmhouse.'\nEllen DeGeneresCalifornia\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi's English neighbours reveal all about their new life in Cotswolds after couple fled the United States following Donald Trump's reelection\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nDiane Keaton cuddles up to her dog in last photo before she died aged 79\n\nTALK OF THE TOWN: The curtain comes down on Ralph Fiennes' swipe at his ex-wife Alex\n\nVictoria Beckham's daughter Harper, 14, 'set to follow in her mother's footsteps as she makes major business move'\n\nEye-popping pictures that prove Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau ARE a couple: Passionate kisses.

Katie Porter’s (D-CA) blowup on a reporter asking her how she intends to lure Trump voters into supporting her shows the “arrogance” and the “entitled attitude” of California Democrats.\n\nWhile talking to Washington Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle on Breitbart News Saturday, Hilton spoke about Porter, who is hoping to replace California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D). Hilton announced in April that he was running to be the next governor of California.\n\nWhen asked his thoughts about an interview between Porter and reporter Julie Watts with CBS News California Investigates, in which Porter became irritated and threatened to end the interview after being asked how she intended to get Trump voters to vote for her, Hilton explained that her attitude in the interview “was really ripping the mask off not just her” but off of the Democrat Party in the state.\n\n“I guess it’s good news in one sense. But, actually, the thing that I really feel is that yes, it’s about her and her terrible inept performance, and what it reveals about her. But, the deeper point is what it reveals about the Democratic Party, because the attitude that we saw on display in that was really ripping the mask off not just her, but the whole California Democrat machine. That arrogance, the entitled attitude, the, like, ‘How dare you ask me questions?’ This is what they are all like in California,” Hilton said.\n\n“We’ve had fifteen years of one-party rule. They never get challenge, there’s never any accountability for their failures, they’ve got the worst results of any state in the country, we have the highest costs for gas, electricity, housing, rent, water, you name it, insurance. The highest unemployment rate, the highest poverty rate, the worst business climate.”\n\nHilton added that while everything in California is a “total disaster,” Democrats such as former Vice President Kamala Harris, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, and Porter “keep trucking on” with the mindset that they can continue to stay in office forever,” which Hilton noted was “arrogant.”\n\n“That’s the arrogance that you get when you’ve been in power too long, and I think people are sick of it. And, I think this was a real moment where people can see who these people are. That’s why I’m really confident, actually, that we’re going to win. I know people look at this race and think, ‘How’s a Republican going to win?’ I think we’re going to win because people are sick of these elitist Democrats in California and their terrible results, and we want change.”\n\nHilton pointed out that while the mid-term elections generally have a “lower turnout,” you can change the turnout in places such as California with a “positive campaign about the changes” that can be made, and by firing people up.","summary":"California Republican gubernatorial candidate Steve Hilton pointed out that former Rep.

Here’s Why.","text":"Virginians with even a modicum of decency were rightly repulsed by vile 2022 text messages from Jay Jones, the Democrat nominee for state attorney general, made public last week, in which he wished for two bullets to the head of then-Virginia House of Delegates Speaker Todd Gilbert—and for the killing of Gilbert’s two young children.\n\nIn purely “CYA” mode, Jones’ Democrat ticket mates running for governor and lieutenant governor were quick to join in the deserved condemnation of Jones’ despicable remarks.\n\nBut now, more than a week later, they still have not taken the next step and called on Jones to quit the race.\n\nAppalling as that is, it comes as no surprise to those of us who remember the equally shocking case of Susanna Gibson, a Democrat who ran for the House of Delegates just two years ago. More on that in a moment.\n\nAt a candidate’s debate Thursday night, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican nominee for governor, repeatedly pressed her opponent, Democrat former Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, to call on Jones to quit. Even a debate moderator repeatedly asked Spanberger about it, but the Democrat ducked, dodged, and weaved. Spanberger refused to answer whether she thought Jones should leave the race with what should have been the obvious one-word answer: “Yes.”\n\n“We’re all running our individual races,” Spanberger stammered, when asked point-blank for a “yes or no” answer. “It’s up to every voter to make their own individual decision.”\n\nNo profile in courage, Spanberger’s unwillingness to declare Jones unfit for office makes clear her condemnations of him were as performative as they were perfunctory.\n\nThe same can be said of Jones’ abject apologies for the damning texts.\n\nSpanberger and the Democrat lieutenant governor nominee, state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, apparently can’t bring themselves to pull the trigger—metaphorically—and call the despicable text messages of the man who aspires to become the state’s top law enforcement officer what they are—namely, disqualifying for the job.\n\nAt Thursday night’s debate, Spanberger again denounced Jones’ violent rhetoric as “absolutely abhorrent,” but offered up only Kamala Harris-like word salads when asked repeatedly whether she thought Jones should quit the race.\n\nThe failure—not just of Spanberger and Hashmi, but also of other high-ranking Virginia Democrats, among them U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine—to call for Jones to step aside calls to mind a onetime favorite adage of the Left, albeit one used in other contexts: “Silence = Assent.”\n\nThat brings us back to Gibson, who refused to end a 2023 bid for the state legislature after it was revealed in September of that year that she had posted videos of sex acts with her husband on a pay-for-play pornographic website.\n\nThen as now, top Virginia Democrats circled the wagons and refused to demand Gibson get out of the race.\n\nState Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, the Virginia Senate majority chairwoman, criticized the release of the videos as “an invasion of privacy” and insisted that Gibson’s purported qualifications for office were all that really mattered. (Despite the sex scandal, and perhaps because of the wagon-circling, Gibson came shockingly close to winning, garnering 48.8% of vote.)Fast-forwarding two years, Locke and state Senate President Pro Tem Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, issued a joint statement in which they called Jones’ texts “deeply disturbing”—but apparently not “disturbing” enough to give up the chance for Democrats to win back the state Attorney General’s Office from Republican incumbent Jason Miyares.\n\nLocke and Lucas insisted—laughably and evidence to the contrary notwithstanding—that Jones “has demonstrated the character and compassion the Office of Attorney General deserves.”\n\n“There is no place for political violence or violent rhetoric in our public discourse,” Locke and Lucas tut-tutted and tsk-tsk’d, adding, “Jay must take accountability for his actions. But we will not allow this moment to distract from the urgent fight we are in for Virginia’s future.”\n\nLikewise, after condemning Jones’ texts, Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, urged voters to keep their attention on the broader stakes of the election, the Virginia Mercury reported.\n\n“We can’t get distracted, because they want us to get distracted by the text message here or something else. Stay focused,” he said.\n\nFor its part, the Democratic Attorneys General Association has given no indication it would ask for the $3.1 million it has donated to Jones’ campaign back.\n\nIn other words, for Democrats, it’s party and political power uber alles.\n\nHow do these Democrats propose that Jones ‘take accountability for his actions’ if not by quitting the race in disgrace?\n\nIf not wishing death on a political opponent (or a sex scandal), what would it take to get Democrats to throw one of their candidates under the campaign bus?\n\nNo one doubts that if this had been Miyares, Virginia Republicans would have rightly demanded that he not only end his bid for reelection, but also that he immediately vacate his office.\n\nYou could ask then-U.S. Rep. Todd Akin, R-Mo., who in 2012 rejected calls from fellow Republicans to quit his bid for Senate after causing a political firestorm with insensitive remarks about rape and abortion.\n\nLike Gibson, Akin insisted on remaining in the race, but unlike Gibson, he lost in a landslide. There might be a lesson there waiting for Jones on Nov. 4.","summary":"Virginians with even a modicum of decency were rightly repulsed by vile 2022 text messages from Jay Jones, the Democrat nominee for state attorney general,...

The state Democratic Party and both of Virginia’s Democratic U.S. Senators pushed for it. Nationally prominent Democrats such as 2016 presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi concurred. The party’s gubernatorial nominee in this year’s election, former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, joined the parade, saying the “bigotry displayed in this photograph is appalling”.\n\nSPANBERGER SILENT ON JAY JONES ENDORSEMENT UNDER HEAT FROM EARLE-SEARS IN FIERY VIRGINIA DEBATE\n\nRacist sentiments are always beyond the pale, and it’s easy to understand why Democrats roundly demanded the governor’s head. But racism is not the worst sin one can be guilty of. Murder for any reason is more evil than that, and that is exactly what Jones called for in the explosive texts.\n\nThe August 2022 exchange with former Republican state Delegate Carrie Coyner is horrific. He said that the then-GOP Speaker of the House, Todd Gilbert, should get “two bullets to the head” for his non-progressive views. He doubled down when Coyner expressed disgust, calling her to defend his views. He even said that Gilbert’s wife and he were “breeding little fascists” and wished that the wife could see her child die in her arms so that Gilbert would reconsider his views.\n\nHe then followed up on that desire in further texts, telling Coyner that “only when people feel pain personally do they move on policy”.\n\nOne might think that these violent views would spur immediate outrage among his Democratic colleagues and ticket mates. After all, if a 35-year-old racist photo makes one unworthy of high office, three-year-old expressions that one’s political opponents and their children should be murdered for their views should be immediately disqualifying.\n\nAlas, that has not happened.\n\nSpanberger has expressed her “disgust” for his statements, but has not withdrawn her support for him. The state Democratic Party chairman, Lamont Bagby, says the texts are not something “anyone should end their political bid over.” Sen. Tim Kaine, who said that Northam’s 35-year-old photo had “broken the trust Virginians must have in their leaders” as he called for Northam’s resignation, says that Jones’ texts are “indefensible” but “out of character” and remains supportive of Jones’ campaign. \n\nThe verdict is in and it’s unanimous. For Virginia Democrats, racists are out, and would-be murderers are in.\n\nThat should shock everyone. The fact that it apparently does not is also telling. Such is the degree of political polarization among Democrats that the enemy of my enemy — President Donald Trump and the Republican Party — that even direct expressions of support for political violence can be tolerated and rationalized.\n\nIn both cases, Democratic politicians are merely following their base voters’ sentiments.\n\nIt’s long been clear that Democrats view even the hint of racism with hatred and scorn. That’s not surprising, since so many of them believe that America and its laws are systemically racist. President Joe Biden frequently expressed that view while vowing to root such malign patterns of belief out of American life. \n\nPoliticians cannot stay in office if they do not reflect and voice their voters’ views. Thus, Democrats rush to condemn anything and anyone their voters would consider to be racist. \n\nDemocratic voters, especially their most loyal and activist ones, do not today uniformly condemn political violence.\n\nThe online reactions to Charlie Kirk’s assassination are one example of that. Far too many people on the left openly rejoiced at his murder, costing some their jobs. Others condemned his death but essentially said he had it coming because of his active propagation of his views.\n\nPolls also show a significant element of the Democratic Party’s base is at a minimum willing to tolerate political violence. A recent poll found that 44% of very liberal voters agree with the statement that “violence is often necessary to create social change”. That poll also found that 49% of Gen Z liberals and 40% of people with a graduate or professional degree — an extremely Democratic voting demographic — also agree with this statement.\n\nAn Economist/YouGov poll taken shortly after Charlie Kirk’s assassination also found that support for political violence was significantly higher among liberals and Kamala Harris voters than it was among conservatives or Donald Trump voters.\n\nIt’s easy to see why so many Democrats believe this when one considers how many think Trump is literally destroying America. A late September New York Times/Siena College poll found that 58% of registered Democrats believe that our problems are so bad that “America is in danger of failing as a nation.” Eighty-four percent of Democrats believe that Trump’s second-term actions “are a unique threat to our system of government,” while around 50% of them think that the terms “free nation” and “democratic nation” do not describe America very well or at all.\n\nIn the face of such existential anger and despair, is it any wonder so many are at least tolerant of horrific behaviors to stop a catastrophe?\n\nAnd in the face of that large segment of Democratic Party opinion, is it any wonder that leading Democrats are choosing to “hate the sin” of Jones’ texts while “loving the sinner” who has sent them?\n\nThis center will not hold. Polls already show that Jones’ once significant lead has faded. Jones’ own internal poll shows him only 1 point ahead while one taken for the Republican Attorneys General Association has incumbent GOP AG Jason Miyares ahead by 2. Expect Jones’ position to deteriorate now that both Miyares and GOP gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears are running ads focusing on this issue.\n\nRepublicans should keep their nerve and drive this home to Virginia voters in every opportunity they have. They should try to force Spanberger to call on Jones to step aside and repeat those calls even if she initially resists. Americans in the center do not want political violence, and they will start to think twice about Spanberger if she cannot bring herself to share their values.\n\nThey should also demand that every Democrats running for a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates openly reject Jones’ candidacy. Republicans face an uphill battle to regain control in the 100-seat body, but there are enough seats that will support a Republican in the right circumstances to make this possible. \n\nIn short, the GOP needs to make this a partisan issue, not a personal one. It’s not enough for them to defeat Jones: they need to force Democrats to make the choice they are avoiding between siding with their rage-filled base or the average moderate voter.\n\nOne way to do that might involve an ad featuring Mrs. Gilbert and her children. With her kids by her side, she can calmly address the camera and tell voters what Jones wished upon her offspring. She can state the truth: that Democrats continue to endorse Jones’ candidacy despite his heinous texts. Mrs. Gilbert can conclude by noting there’s only one way Virginia voters can say they want a stop to the country’s downward fall towards increasing violence: reject the party that can’t bring itself to condemn it.\n\nAn ad featuring Charlie Kirk’s widow, Erika, can make a similar claim. She knows what political violence can do as she and her young children have lost a father. She has the moral credibility to say this must end, and Democrats who can’t openly reject someone who disagrees can’t be trusted to hold office.\n\nOne suspects that ads like these would move the needle quickly, forcing Spanberger’s and the Democrats’ hands. Done rapidly enough, that could save them this time. But the ongoing problem – the party dynamic that means rejecting Jones is even a question – will remain.\n\nDEMOCRATS CLEARLY IN NEED OF ANGER MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Jones saga reminds us of how deeply sick some elements of the extreme Left are. America needs two healthy parties that reject violent extremes and seek to channel legitimate anger into positive, democratic action. If the Democrats cannot bring themselves to do that, then Republicans should lean into that sad opportunity with everything they’ve got.\n\nIn that sense, perhaps Jones touched on something when he noted that it sometimes takes personal pain for someone to change their politics. If Democratic politicians personally experience the political pain of defeat through their tolerance of their violent minority, perhaps we can finally start to see a reduction of the hateful rhetoric that is poisoning our politics.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

FAMILY BREAKUPS OVER POLITICS MAY HURT MORE THAN YOU THINK, EXPERT SAYS The reader continued his critiques, chastising his friend for only sharing her political beliefs on social media rather than attending protests in her small rural town. \"She comes off to me as someone who’s comfortable in her life and doesn’t want to shake anything up, which is the height of hypocrisy to me,\" he added. \"I feel like apathy is how we got here in the first place, and I’m really struggling with how and whether to keep people like this in my life.\" The Ethicist noted that for those who live in large urban cities in the U.S., attending progressive protests is about as \"contentious as an ice cream social\" and \"cost-free\" for its participants — \"Most people you know will be pleased to see you out there.\" YOUNG MEN SHIFTING TO POLITICAL RIGHT IS CAUSING WOMEN TO DISTRUST DATING APPS, SAYS ATLANTIC WRITER \"For her, in a small Trump-supporting town, it’s another story. Neighbors who see her at a protest are neighbors she’ll see at the supermarket and the school board. That could mean living with their disapproval; it could also mean ostracism,\" Appiah pointed out. \"And unlike in cities, where numbers can swell to visibility, protests in small, homogeneous towns may achieve little beyond reinforcing the majority’s sense that the minority is odd or out of step.\" Responding to the reader's assertion that her friend's unwillingness to fully express her political beliefs is the \"height of hypocrisy,\" the Ethicist questioned whether it's fair to label her friend a hypocrite. \"Hypocrisy means professing beliefs you don’t hold. She shares your views but confronts some very different costs when it comes to public action,\" he explained. \"And then, because she’s married to a Trump supporter, those costs run right through her daily life.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE While the reader claimed that \"apathy is how we got here,\" Appiah suggested that some researchers would say that \"condescension played a part\" in how he approached his friend's situation. \"The political scientist Katherine Cramer, for example, has explored how rural resentment has been fueled by perceptions of urban disdain,\" he noted. In his closing remarks, the Ethicist offered a humbling reflection — suggesting that perhaps it's the reader's friend who should rethink their relationship, not the reader. \"As you ask whether to keep people like your low-key friend in your life, I fear that the failure of empathy here is on your side. Your small-town friend may have assessed her circumstances more carefully than you give her credit for. Maybe the question is whether she should keep someone in her life who refuses to consider that possibility,\" Appiah concluded. In November 2024, after the presidential election, the Ethicist column responded to a reader question about how Democratic voters should deal with close relatives who supported Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris. \"I strongly oppose Trump, as do my wife and her family, who live nearby. I’m troubled by my mother’s support of someone I consider morally abhorrent and dangerous, especially when she voted in a former swing state,\" the person seeking advice wrote. \"With the result of the 2024 election, my wife and her family are directing their understandable fury at my mother. My wife’s sister said, ‘‘If she voted for Trump again, I’m completely done with her.’’ I expect that the next time they interact it will not be pretty.\" The Ethicist has tackled a similar question in October 2024, answering a reader's question about whether it is appropriate to leave the country if the \"wrong\" candidate becomes president. In February 2025, a reader asked the advice column whether a \"straight White dude\" can date \"women of color\" to \"combat racism.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"NY Times Magazine&apos;s &apos;The Ethicist&apos; column suggested empathy after a liberal reader criticized his rural friend for not being politically active enough in her small rural community.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/ny-times-advice-column-tells-liberal-reader-develop-empathy-rural-friend-trump-supporting-husband","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/03/Trump-New-York-Times.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-11 20:05:44","author":"Marc Tamasco","authors":["Marc Tamasco"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.336},{"id":368435996,"title":"Joe Biden begins cancer treatment after prostate disease spreads to bones","text":"Joe Biden, former United States president has begun radiation therapy as part of treatment for prostate cancer, his office confirmed on Saturday.\n\nBiden, 82, was diagnosed in May with what doctors described as an “aggressive” form of the disease that had already spread to his bones.

According to the American Cancer Society, about one in eight men will develop prostate cancer during their lifetime, while the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 13 out of every 100 men will be diagnosed at some point.\n\nBiden’s medical history includes several other health challenges in recent years. Last month, he underwent Mohs surgery to remove cancerous cells from his skin. In February 2023, doctors removed a small lesion from his chest that was identified as basal cell carcinoma—a common and typically non-aggressive form of skin cancer. \n\nEarlier, in 2021, he had a benign but potentially pre-cancerous polyp removed from his colon.\n\nRead also: Joe Biden diagnosed with COVID-19, will self-isolate and continue duties\n\nThe former president, who turns 83 next month, left office in January as the oldest person ever to serve as US president. Concerns about his health and age were a recurring issue during his first term,\n\neventually prompting him to end his re-election campaign earlier this year. His former vice-president, Kamala Harris, went on to represent the Democratic Party in the presidential race but lost to Donald Trump, the current US president.\n\nBiden has long made cancer research one of his defining causes. In 2022, he and his wife, Jill Biden, relaunched the “Cancer Moonshot” initiative, an ambitious programme aimed at cutting the cancer death rate in half over 25 years and preventing more than four million deaths by 2047.\n\nHis commitment to the cause is deeply personal. In 2015, Biden lost his eldest son, Beau Biden, to brain cancer—a tragedy that profoundly shaped his outlook on public service and medical research.\nSpeaking shortly after his own diagnosis earlier this year, Biden reflected on the shared experience of illness, saying, “Cancer touches us all.”\nIn recent months, the former president has kept a low public profile as he continues treatment and recovery.\n\nProstate cancer primarily affects older men, with research suggesting that up to 80 percent of men over the age of 80 may have cancerous cells in the prostate gland—though many cases remain slow-growing and harmless.\n\nMedical experts stress that early detection and access to advanced treatment options like radiation and hormone therapy can significantly improve outcomes, even in high-grade cases like Biden’s.\n\nWhile the coming weeks of treatment will likely be demanding, doctors say the combination of radiation and hormone therapy remains a proven, effective approach for managing prostate cancer, especially when caught before it becomes resistant to treatment.","summary":"Joe Biden, former United States president has begun radiation therapy as part of treatment for prostate cancer, his office confirmed\n\n\nread more Joe Biden begins cancer treatment after prostate disease spreads to bones","url":"https://businessday.ng/world/article/joe-biden-begins-cancer-treatment-after-prostate-disease-spreads-to-bones/","image":"https://cdn.businessday.ng/2021/01/Untitled-design-2021-01-21T163221.570.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-11 19:59:05","author":"Faith Omoboye","authors":["Faith Omoboye"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.334},{"id":368407260,"title":"Tech billionaire Marc Benioff says Trump should deploy National Guard to San Francisco","text":"By Clara Harter | Los Angeles Times\n\nLOS ANGELES — Marc Benioff has become the latest Silicon Valley tech leader to signal his approval of President Donald Trump, saying that the president is doing a great job and ought to deploy the National Guard to deal with crime in San Francisco.\n\nThe Salesforce chief executive’s comments came as he headed to San Francisco to host his annual Dreamforce conference — an event for which he said he had to hire hundreds of off-duty police to provide security.\n\n“We don’t have enough cops, so if they [National Guard] can be cops, I’m all for it,” he told the New York Times from aboard his private plane.\n\nThe National Guard is generally not allowed to perform domestic law enforcement duties when federalized by the president.\n\nLast month, a federal judge ruled that Trump’s use of National Guard soldiers in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act — which restricts use of the military for domestic law enforcement — and ordered that the troops not be used in law enforcement operations within California.\n\nTrump has also ordered the National Guard to deploy to cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, citing the need to protect federal officers and assets in the face of ongoing immigration protests. Those efforts have been met with criticism from local leaders and are the subject of ongoing legal battles.\n\nPresident Trump has yet to direct troops to Northern California, but suggested in September that San Francisco could be a target for deployment. He has said that cities with Democratic political leadership such as San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles “are very unsafe places and we are going to straighten them out.”\n\n“I told [Defense Secretary] Pete [Hegseth] we should use some of these dangerous cities as training for our military, our national guard,” Trump said.\n\nBenioff’s call to send National Guard troops to San Francisco drew sharp rebukes from several of the region’s elected Democratic leaders.\n\nSan Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said she “can’t be silent any longer” and threatened to prosecute any leaders or troops who harass residents in a fiery statement on X.\n\n“I am responsible for holding criminals accountable, and that includes holding government and law enforcement officials too, when they cross the bounds of the law,” she said. “If you come to San Francisco and illegally harass our residents, use excessive force or cross any other boundaries that the law prescribes, I will not hesitate to do my job and hold you accountable just like I do other violators of the law every single day.”\n\nState Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, also took to X to express indignation, saying, “we neither need nor want an illegal military occupation in San Francisco.”\n\n“Salesforce is a great San Francisco company that does so much good for our city,” he said. “Inviting Trump to send the National Guard here is not one of those good things. Quite the opposite.”\n\nSan Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie’s office offered a more muted response, touting the mayor’s efforts to boost public safety in general, but declining to directly address Benioff’s remarks.\n\nCharles Lutvak, a spokesperson for the mayor, noted that the city is seeing net gains in both police officers and sheriff’s deputies for the first time in a decade. He also highlighted Lurie’s efforts to bring police staffing up to 2,000 officers.\n\n“Crime is down nearly 30% citywide and at its lowest point in decades,” Lutvak said. “We are moving in the right direction and will continue to prioritize safety and hiring while San Francisco law enforcement works every single day to keep our city safe.”\n\nWhen contacted by The Times on Friday night, the office of Gov. Gavin Newsom, who vociferously opposed the deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles, did not issue a comment in response to Benioff.\n\nBenioff and Newsom have long been considered friends, with a relationship dating back to when Newsom served as San Francisco’s mayor. Newsom even named Benioff as godfather to one of his children, according to the San Francisco Standard.\n\nBenioff has often referred to himself as an independent. He has donated to several liberal causes, including a $30 million donation to UC San Francisco to study homelessness, and has contributed to prior political campaigns of former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Kamala Harris, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Hillary Clinton.\n\nHowever, he has also donated to the campaigns of former House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. John McCain, both Republicans, and supported tougher-on-crime policies and reducing government spending.\n\nEarlier this year, Benioff also praised the Elon Musk-led federal cost-cutting effort known as the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n“I fully support the president,” Benioff told the New York Times this week. “I think he’s doing a great job.”\n\n©2025 Los Angeles Times.

Very dated.\" EXPERTS WARN LEFTIST CELEBRATIONS OF CHARLIE KIRK'S DEATH SIGNAL A DANGEROUS MAINSTREAM SHIFT IN POLITICS Ellis rejected one film critic's opinion that \"One Battle After Another\" was an \"important movie,\" arguing that the filmmakers failed to take the country's strenuous political climate into account. \"No, it is not. It has really not read the room,\" he countered. \"It has not read the room at all about what’s going on in America.\" The film, inspired by Thomas Pynchon's Reagan-era set novel \"Vineland,\" follows The French 75, a Weather Underground-like group of self-described revolutionaries rebelling against what they believe is authoritarianism. The revolutionary group breaks illegal immigrants out of detention centers and bombs courthouses and offices of lawmakers who pushed abortion bans throughout the course of the film. LEONARDO DICAPRIO IS 'SLOWING DOWN A BIT' IN HIS NEW CAREER PHASE AFTER DECADES IN HOLLYWOOD Hollywood veteran Sean Penn also stars in the film from director Paul Thomas Anderson, playing Army Col. Steven Lockjaw — a man auditioning for a secretive, elite White supremacist group known as the Christmas Adventurers. The organization wields significant political influence and devotes its time to hunting down members of The French 75. FoxNews.com columnist David Marcus slammed the movie as an \"ill-timed apologia for left-wing violence,\" comparing it to \"watching a World War II film in which viewers are meant to cheer for lovable Nazis.\" \"What is missing here is even the slightest bit of nuance about the glorious necessity to kill people, including innocents, in order to topple Anderson’s weird and paranoid version of the American government,\" Marcus wrote in an opinion column last month. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE The conservative outlet National Review also criticized \"One Battle After Another,\" warning that \"there will be bloodlust\" inspired by the film. \"It’s a macabre coincidence that One Battle After Another opens so soon after the assassination of peaceable conservative debater Charlie Kirk,\" the outlet wrote. \"The film undeniably romanticizes political assassination … Anderson intentionally provokes the bloodlust of his woke confreres (and Gen Z viewers who know nothing about the Sixties) by celebrating the insipid, heretical, and violent activities of the liberal past and present. Anderson’s title lacks Pynchon’s pith but daydreams a culture of never-ending political obstruction and pandemonium. It is the year’s most irresponsible movie.\" Although some critics have voiced their concerns over the film's themes of political violence and revolution, it has been a massive hit at the box office — bringing in over $100 million globally since its premiere in September and currently sits as the highest rated film of 2025 on Metacritic.

Instead, anger is the first word that usually comes to mind. \n\nHere are ten examples of anger on display during Trump’s second term: \n\n“This dude [Ted Cruz] has to be knocked over the head, like, hard, right? Like, there is no niceties with him, like, at all!” said Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX). \n\n“[Trump senior advisor] Stephen Miller needs to be THUMPED! That guy’s a freaking worm. I would be willing to go to jail for – I mean, how much [time] would I get for just cracking him a couple of times?” said North Carolina congressional candidate Richard Ojeda (D). \n\n“Three people, two bullets. Gilbert, Hitler and Pol Pot. Gilbert gets two bullets to the head. Spoiler – put [Republican Todd] Gilbert in the crew with the two worst people you know and he receives both bullets every time,” said Jay Jones (D), Attorney General candidate in Virginia, who also wished death upon Gilbert’s wife and two young children in text messages released this month by a Republican colleague. Jones also referred to the children as “little fascists.” \n\n“Let your rage fuel you!” Virginia gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger (D) said to supporters at a rally in June. Spanberger has refused to call on Jones to drop out of the race. \n\n“I’m like, ‘You know what? I’m not the one. Don’t come for me unless I send for you.’ And I did not send for this malignant clown,” said House Speaker Hakeem Jeffries, commenting on a confrontation he had with Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) during which he told Lawler to “keep your mouth shut.” \n\n“The visceral response from people across the country who feel cheated, ripped off, and threatened by the vile practices of their insurance companies should be a warning to everyone in the healthcare system,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said after Luigi Mangione murdered United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson by shooting him in the back in the middle of Manhattan. \n\n“Violence is never the answer,” Warren added. “But people can only be pushed so far.”\n\n“There is no legacy to honor. It was a legacy filled with bigotry, hatred, and white supremacy,” Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) said in a podcast interview after Charlie Kirk was assassinated without citing any specific quotes to back up her farcical claim. “And as a black woman and as a Muslim in this country, I refuse to join the chorus that changes the history of what is on the record from this man.”\n\n“We’re going to punch these sons of bitches in the mouth,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said on his podcast, talking about Republicans. \n\n“Get out of my f****** shot!” exclaimed California gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter to a staffer during a taped interview. The staffer tried to explain to Porter that her argument was wrong on electric vehicles, but Porter was livid despite the interview not being live.\n\n“You also were in my shot before that. Stay out of my shot,” Porter reiterated. \n\nThe clip has since gone viral to the tune of millions of views. But Porter will benefit from “news” shows like The View, which somehow falls under ABC’s news department. \n\nHere is co-host Whoopi Goldberg somehow defending Porter with the “everybody-treats-their-staff-this-way” argument.\n\n“I have done this, I have been rude to people…” Goldberg began. \n\n“But you’re not running for elected official,” co-host Sara Haines injected. \n\n“No, but I’ve been rude and that’s my point,” Goldberg continued. \n\n“And I understand, but I would expect something differently from her,” Haines replied. \n\n“No, she’s just another human being,” Goldberg shot back, as if this is normal behavior on display from Porter in any ordinary workplace that would get other people fired. \n\nThis wasn’t a one-off with Porter, either. Just a day before the video of her berating a staffer made it into the mainstream, she walked out of an interview with a Sacramento CBS affiliate because the reporter, Julie Watts, actually asked follow-up questions around winning over moderate and conservative voters in her gubernatorial race. \n\n“I don’t want to keep doing this. I’m going to call it,” Porter said in attempting to end the interview over perfectly reasonable questions. \n\n“I want to have a pleasant, positive conversation. … If every question you’re going to make up a follow-up question, then we’re never going to get there and we are just going to circle around.”\n\nThe anger management issue threatens to turn the California governor’s race into an unexpectedly competitive one. According to betting site Kalshi, Porter’s chances of being governor were 40% just one week ago, before the CBS interview and the staffer scolding video emerged. It’s now at just 16%. Actions have consequences, especially in a social media environment. \n\nDemocrats keep telling us that they simply need to fight President Donald Trump and Republicans harder while amping up the rhetoric. \n\n“We’re going to bring a knife fight to a knife fight,” declared DNC Chairman Ken Martin. \n\nBut the party continues to plummet in the polls. A CNN poll, for example, shows that just 16% of American adults say the party has strong leaders, while just 19% say it’s a party that can get things done. Those are the lowest numbers we’ve seen for any party in polling history. \n\nMeanwhile, on the Republican side and especially as it pertains to Trump, the once stuffy party of country club rich guys is now the fun party. The 2024 campaign said it all: While Trump was being compared to Hitler and a fascist even after two assassination attempts, he worked a drive-through at McDonald’s, smiling and chatting up customers. And when President Joe Biden angrily referred to all Trump supporters as garbage, Trump’s team quickly secured a garbage truck in Wisconsin while the candidate dressed up as a garbage man and loved every minute of it. \n\nBoth moments went viral in places that typical campaigns and all the TV ad buys in the world could not reach. So while Kamala Harris was doing forgetful interviews on CNN or MSNBC, Trump cast himself as the happy warrior while mocking Democrats in the process.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris shared her support on X, stating, “Doug and I are saddened to learn of President Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis. We are keeping him, Dr. Biden, and their entire family in our hearts and prayers during this time. Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership.”\n\nEven President Donald Trump offered well-wishes, stating, “Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.”\n\nFor more on the former president’s diagnosis and the latest updates on his condition, Hollywood Life has rounded up everything you need to know below.\n\nWhat Type of Cancer Does Joe Biden Have?\n\nBiden was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5), indicating a high-grade cancer. The disease has metastasized to his bones, suggesting an advanced stage.\n\nWhat Is Prostate Cancer?\n\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, prostate cancer is a disease that begins in the prostate gland and is one of the most common cancers among men. While many prostate cancers grow slowly and may not cause significant harm, aggressive forms can spread rapidly to other parts of the body, such as bones and lymph nodes.\n\nHow Is Joe Biden Doing Today?\n\nAs of May 2025, Biden is meeting with his doctors to explore treatment options. According to CBS News and People, the cancer is hormone-sensitive, which may allow for effective treatment options.\n\nAccording to People and the BBC, he has expressed gratitude for the public’s support, saying, “Cancer touches us all… Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places.”\n\nBiden also stated, “Man, I’ve learned this journey is full of unexpected turns. But we face them together. And I’m grateful to have this nation behind me.”\n\nIn October 2025, a rep for Biden told People, “As part of a treatment plan for prostate cancer, President Biden is currently undergoing radiation therapy and hormone treatment.” Sources told the outlet that the former president was “responding well” to his treatment.\n\nHow Old Is Joe Biden Now?\n\nBiden is currently 82 years old. He was born on November 20, 1942.\n\nIs There a Cure for Prostate Cancer?\n\nAccording to the Moffitt Cancer Center and MD Anderson Cancer Center, prostate cancer can often be cured if caught early. For advanced cases like Biden’s, treatment may not offer a cure but can effectively manage symptoms and slow the disease’s progression.","summary":"Image Credit: Getty Images Joe Biden is facing a new health battle following the announcement of his aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis.

Harris subsequently lost to Trump, who commenced his second term in January.The American Cancer Society identifies prostate cancer as the most prevalent cancer among men. The condition is notably frequent in elderly men, with studies indicating approximately 80 percent of men over 80 have cancerous cells in their prostate gland.Despite being highly treatable when detected early, it ranks as the second leading cause of cancer mortality in men, according to the organisation. Hormone therapy, while effective in reducing tumours and slowing cancer progression, does not provide a cure.","summary":"Former US President Joe Biden is undergoing radiation and hormone treatments for prostate cancer, diagnosed in May.
