(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)\n\nThe monthly jobs report is already closely-watched on Wall Street and in Washington but has taken on a new importance after President Donald Trump on Friday fired the official who oversees it. Trump claimed that June's employment figures were \"RIGGED\" to make him and other Republicans \"look bad.\" Yet he provided no evidence and even the official Trump had appointed in his first term to oversee the report, William Beach, condemned the firing of Erika McEntarfer, the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics appointed by former President Joe Biden. The firing followed Friday's jobs report that showed hiring was weak in July and had come to nearly a standstill in May and June, right after Trump rolled out sweeping tariffs.

Yet Friday's revisions were unusually large - the largest, outside of a recession, in five decades. And the surveys used to compile the report are facing challenges from declining response rates, particularly since COVID, as fewer companies complete the surveys. Nonetheless, that hasn't led most economists to doubt them. \"The bottom line for me is, I wouldn't take the low collection rate as any evidence that the numbers are less reliable,\" Omair Sharif, founder and chief economist at Inflation Insights, a consulting firm, said.Live Events Many academics, statisticians and economists have warned for some time that declining budgets were straining the government's ability to gather economic data. There were several government commissions studying ways to improve things like survey response rates, but the Trump administration disbanded them earlier this year. Heather Boushey, a top economic adviser in the Biden White House, noted that without Trump's firing of McEntarfer, there would be more focus on last week's data, which points to a slowing economy. \"We're having this conversation about made-up issues to distract us from what the data is showing,\" Boushey said. \"Revisions of this magnitude in a negative direction may indicate bad things to come for the labor market.\" Here are some things to know about the jobs report: Economists and Wall Street trust the data Most economists say that the Bureau of Labor Statistics is a nonpolitical agency staffed by people obsessed with getting the numbers right. The only political appointee is the commissioner, who doesn't see the data until it's finalized, two days before it is issued to the public. Erica Groshen, the BLS commissioner from 2013 to 2017, said she suggested different language in the report to \"liven it up\", but was shot down. She was told that if asked to describe a cup as half-empty or half-full, BLS says \"it is an eight ounce cup with four ounces of liquid.\" The revised jobs data that has attracted Trump's ire is actually more in line with other figures than before the revision. For example, payroll processor ADP uses data from its millions of clients to calculate its own jobs report, and it showed a sharp hiring slowdown in May and June that is closer to the revised BLS data. Trump and his White House have a long track record of celebrating the jobs numbers - when they are good. These are the figures Trump is attacking Trump has focused on the revisions to the May and June data, which on Friday were revised lower, with job gains in May reduced to 19,000 from 144,000, and for June to just 14,000 from 147,000. Every month's jobs data is revised in the following two months. Trump also repeated a largely inaccurate attack from the campaign about an annual revision last August, which reduced total employment in the United States by 818,000, or about 0.5%. The government also revises employment figures every year. Trump charged the annual revision was released before the 2024 presidential election to \"boost\" Vice President Kamala Harris's \"chances of Victory,\" yet it was two months before the election and widely reported at the time that the revision lowered hiring during the Biden-Harris administration and pointed to a weaker economy. Here's why the government revises the data The monthly revisions occur because many companies that respond to the government's surveys send their data in late, or correct the figures they've already submitted. The proportion of companies sending in their data later has risen in the past decade. Every year, the BLS does an additional revision based on actual job counts that are derived from state unemployment insurance records. Those figures cover 95% of U.S. businesses and aren't derived from a survey but are not available in real time. These are the factors that cause revisions Figuring out how many new jobs have been added or lost each month is more complicated than it may sound. For example, if one person takes a second job, should you focus on the number of jobs, which has increased, or the number of employed people, which hasn't? (The government measures both: The unemployment rate is based on how many people either have or don't have jobs, while the number of jobs added or lost is counted separately). Each month, the government surveys about 121,000 businesses and government agencies at over 630,000 locations - including multiple locations for the same business - covering about one-third of all workers. Still, the government also has to make estimates: What if a company goes out of business? It likely won't fill out any forms showing the jobs lost. And what about new businesses? They can take a while to get on the government's radar. The BLS seeks to capture these trends by estimating their impact on employment. Those estimates can be wrong, of course, until they are fixed by the annual revisions. The revisions are often larger around turning points in the economy. For example, when the economy is growing, there may be more startups than the government expects, so revisions will be higher. If the economy is slowing or slipping into a recession, the revisions may be larger on the downside. Here's why the May and June revisions may have been so large Ernie Tedeschi, an economic adviser to the Biden administration, points to the current dynamics of the labor market: Both hiring and firing have sharply declined, and fewer Americans are quitting their jobs to take other work. As a result, most of the job gains or losses each month are probably occurring at new companies, or those going out of business. And those are the ones the government uses models to estimate, which can make them more volatile. Groshen also points out that since the pandemic there has been a surge of new start-up companies, after many Americans lost their jobs or sought more independence. Yet they may not have created as many jobs as startups did pre-COVID, which throws off the government's models. Revisions seem to be getting bigger The revisions to May and June's job totals, which reduced hiring by a total of 258,000, were the largest - outside recessions - since 1967, according to economists at Goldman Sachs. Kevin Hassett, Trump's top economic adviser, went on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday and said, \"What we've seen over the last few years is massive revisions to the jobs numbers.\" Hassett blamed a sharp drop in response rates to the government's surveys during and after the pandemic: \"When COVID happened, because response rates went down a lot, then revision rates skyrocketed.\" Yet calculations by Tedeschi show that while revisions spiked after the pandemic, they have since declined and are much smaller than in the 1960s and 1970s. Other concerns about the government's data Many economists and statisticians have sounded the alarm about things like declining response rates for years. A decade ago, about 60% of companies surveyed by BLS responded. Now, only about 40% do. The decline has been an international phenomenon, particularly since COVID. The United Kingdom has even suspended publication of an official unemployment rate because of falling responses. And earlier this year the BLS said that it was cutting back on its collection of inflation data because of the Trump administration's hiring freeze, raising concerns about the robustness of price data just as economists are trying to gauge the impact of tariffs on inflation. U.S. government statistical agencies have seen an inflation-adjusted 16% drop in funding since 2009, according to a July report from the American Statistical Association. \"We are at an inflection point,\" the report said. \"To meet current and future challenges requires thoughtful, well-planned investment ... In contrast, what we have observed is uncoordinated and unplanned reductions with no visible plan for the future.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onDonald Trumpblswhite housetrumpomair sharifnbcgoldman sachsbureau of labor statisticsbousheyamerican statistical association\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Gary Peters of Michigan, providing an answer could determine their political futures.\n\nAt least one already has: Abdul El-Sayed argued on Monday that his party ran away from its voters — not towards them.\n\nPolling within the margin of error against Rep. Haley Stevens, El-Sayed, 40, is very well positioned to pull off the historic feat of becoming the first-ever Muslim member of the United States Senate. \n\nA poll conducted by the NSRC, the GOP’s Senate campaign arm, put him two points behind Stevens, a Democratic congresswoman and reportedly the Democratic party establishment’s favorite to win the seat. Mallory McMorrow, a state senator, trailed both but was nearing striking distance.\n\n“Democrats still haven't learned this lesson,” El-Sayed insisted on Monday. “It's frustrating because these people made a calculated decision about who they needed and who they didn't. And it turns out that that decision was way off.”\n\nEl-Sayed spoke to The Independent two days before he was set to visit a Yemeni coffeeshop in Dearborn Heights for a meet-and-greet with voters, an area of Michigan that saw one of the sharpest drop offs among Democratic-leaning voters last year.\n\nAcross the state, El-Sayed is running the exact opposite kind of campaign as an increasingly frail Joe Biden ran in 2024. In some ways, his strategy contrasts with Harris,’ too, in ways which clearly didn’t sit well with the former Detroit health commisioner. \n\nOn a recent interview with Twitch streamer Hasan Piker (HasanAbi), the two discussed the Israel-Hamas war and starvation crisis in Gaza, which El-Sayed labels a genocide. But in the hourlong conversation — the likes of which Harris avoided to some dismay from Democrats — the two also bro’d out, chatting about fitness as well as the YouTube and Twitter “shorts” seemingly consuming social media and transforming it into slop.\n\n“I watched this campaign actively run away from certain groups of voters because they did not want to take questions that would expose the inconsistency of their values,” said El-Sayed. “Whether that was Joe Rogan's audience, whether that was Hasan’s audience, there are just groups of people that Democrats have said, ‘you know what? We're going to give up on you, because we don't think we need you to win an election. \n\n“That's not how you do politics,” he continued. “Your job is not about just trying to architect a winning coalition. Your job is about trying to identify the issues that all people need, and then being able to be clear, specific and direct about how you solve them in an effort to win an election, because your agenda would deliver for the most people in the ways that they need.”\n\nHe pinned much of the blame for the party’s stiffness in 2024, exemplified in both Biden and Harris’ campaigns, on a steady stream of donor money the two-time Bernie Sanders-backed candidate argued was poisoning the party. Democratic policies were being winnowed down through a narrow lens of what would be palatable to both the party’s base and their corporate-backed financiers, El-Sayed argued.\n\nThe devastation in Gaza and the Democratic Party’s complicity in not pressuring Israel over it under Biden highlighted a gulf between those two groups he argued was growing for years. The man who could very well be the Democratic Party’s champion in a crucial Senate race spared no criticism for those Democratic elites he argued were responsible for the mess within which the DNC was now mired.\n\n\"Joe Biden's handling of Gaza was indicative of a general failure to be able to do the job,” El-Sayed told The Independent. \n\n\"I wasn't in those rooms,” said El-Sayed. “What I can tell you is what I watched, and what I think the American public watched, [which] is an American president who was struggling to give a coherent statement, to get through a debate, [and] ... to manage a extremely complicated situation in Gaza.”\n\n“I also know that there was this effort to silence those voices who were willing to state what was obvious before our eyes,” he added.\n\nA disrupting voice in the party, El-Sayed is pledging to shake up the geriatric halls of the Senate as well should he become his party’s nominee. He’s hoping that a phenomenon which manifested to propel Zohran Mamdani to victory in the New York City mayoral primary election can be duplicated in the Rust Belt.\n\n“There was an inversion of the demographics of the electorate in that primary, young people came out in droves,” said El-Sayed.\n\n“And here in Michigan, we've got young people who have been sick and tired of the system for a very long time, and our job is to go and talk about the challenges that they're facing in their lives,” he continued, offering an example of the complaints he’s heard: “’I don't know that I'm going to be able to get a job, even though I've done everything you told me to do. I did it all. I'm stuck with $60,000 in debt, and AI is about to take the job I was supposed to have. I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to buy a home. I'm worried about the fact that I'm watching a smokestack corrupt our climate. I'm watching as oil pipelines are flowing through our Great Lakes, and I'm asking what's going to be left for me.”\n\nAs senator, El-Sayed says he’d back leveraging Democratic votes on legislation to fund the government: the kind of shutdown politics Chuck Schumer refused to play earlier in 2025. He also supports ending the filibuster, according to a staffer. El-Sayed also would not commit to supporting Schumer for another term as leader of the caucus, telling The Independent he wanted to look at his options as 2027 came into view.\n\nFirst he’ll have to win the 2026 primary as well as a general election against Mike Rogers, the Republican Trump-supporting congressman on a path to be crowned the GOP nominee. With a unified Republican Party backing Rogers, El-Sayed is well aware that his Muslim background and stance on Gaza could be weaponized by Republicans in an attempt to overshadow a Zohran Mamdani-like focus on affordability and Michiganders' financial stability.\n\nRepublicans see Michigan as a path to expanding a majority and giving Donald Trump the breathing room he needs to further his legislative agenda in 2027. The loss of Michigan would be a massive blow for a battle-weary DSCC, and a pro-Israel site has already attacked El-Sayed over his sitdown with Hasan Piker.\n\nEl-Sayed argued that the momentum was on his side, and that Democrats needed to be ready to brawl.\n\n“I think we need to stop being afraid,” he said. “I just think we need to punch back harder, right? They want to come after us on this issue, punch back harder.\n\n“I don't back down, I don't pull my punches, and I am more than happy to go at this issue or any other issue with lying MAGA types,” El-Sayed continued. “ I think we can win the American public, but we gotta stop being afraid of our own shadow.”","summary":"‘These people made a calculated decision about who they needed and who they didn't,’ says Democrat Abdul El-Sayed, who is running to win back those voters his party lost in 2024","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/harris-biden-abdul-michigan-democrats-b2801860.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/04/21/23/Abdul-1.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/a98vGseh-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-04 23:40:13","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":348169508,"title":"Megyn Kelly Says VP Harris’ Colbert Interview Reminds Her of Elle Woods in ‘Legally Blonde’: ‘All Classic Kamala’ | Video","text":"Megyn Kelly was reminded of Elle Woods from “Legally Blonde” watching Kamala Harris’ interview on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”\n\nOn Monday’s episode of “The Megyn Kelly Show,” the host was struck by the similarities between the former presidential candidate – who was on the late night show promoting her upcoming book – and the iconic movie character played by Reese Witherspoon. She said the entire interview felt “all classic Kamala.”\n\n“This is what I find interesting about her,” Kelly said. “It’s how empty she is. The only time she really gets animated is when she talks about race, abortion, or herself. Truly, I’m a connoisseur now of this woman’s commentary, and those are the three things that really light her up, and the giggling about when she gets to herself. ‘I call them my baby nieces, like, that’s something special about me. I have this term of endearment about my two nieces. You see, I put the word baby in front of them … That’s what I do. That’s my thing.’”\n\nShe added: “And then she gets equally animated when she gets to her stupid AirPod choice … It’s ridiculous. She comes alive on the subject of ‘Me.’ Reminds me of this gal from ‘Legally Blonde.’”\n\nKelly then played a brief clip from the film showing Woods shouting “Me!” in the Harvard halls.\n\nThat Harris did her first major interview since the election with Colbert likely only added fuel to Kelly’s fire. The SiriusXM host has tirelessly gone after Colbert since CBS announced his show was canceled and coming to an end in May 2026.\n\n“Many of us have had very public cancelations and some were absolutely brutal,” she said after the news dropped. “And we didn’t invite all our friends to come cry on the set and say, ‘Poor poor her. Poor poor him. American democracy will not be the same.’ Some of us took it like professionals, then picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and moved on with life. Is this how it’s going to be for the next year? Watching this crybaby try to play the victim that his show got cancelled? Grow up.

The only political appointee is the commissioner, who doesn’t see the data until it’s finalized, two days before it is issued to the public.\n\nErica Groshen, the BLS commissioner from 2013 to 2017, said she suggested different language in the report to “liven it up”, but was shot down. She was told that if asked to describe a cup as half-empty or half-full, BLS says “it is an eight ounce cup with four ounces of liquid.”\n\nThe revised jobs data that has attracted Trump’s ire is actually more in line with other figures than before the revision. For example, payroll processor ADP uses data from its millions of clients to calculate its own jobs report, and it showed a sharp hiring slowdown in May and June that is closer to the revised BLS data.\n\nTrump and his White House have a long track record of celebrating the jobs numbers — when they are good.\n\nThese are the figures is Trump attacking\n\nTrump has focused on the revisions to the May and June data, which on Friday were revised lower, with job gains in May reduced to 19,000 from 144,000, and for June to just 14,000 from 147,000. Every month’s jobs data is revised in the following two months.\n\nTrump also repeated a largely inaccurate attack from the campaign about an annual revision last August, which reduced total employment in the United States by 818,000, or about 0.5%. The government also revises employment figures every year.\n\nTrump charged the annual revision was released before the 2024 presidential election to “boost” Vice President Kamala Harris’s “chances of Victory,” yet it was two months before the election and widely reported at the time that the revision lowered hiring during the Biden-Harris administration and pointed to a weaker economy.\n\nHere’s why the government revises the data\n\nThe monthly revisions occur because many companies that respond to the government’s surveys send their data in late, or correct the figures they’ve already submitted. The proportion of companies sending in their data later has risen in the past decade.\n\nEvery year, the BLS does an additional revision based on actual job counts that are derived from state unemployment insurance records. Those figures cover 95% of U.S. businesses and aren’t derived from a survey but are not available in real time.\n\nThese are the factors that cause revisions\n\nFiguring out how many new jobs have been added or lost each month is more complicated than it may sound. For example, if one person takes a second job, should you focus on the number of jobs, which has increased, or the number of employed people, which hasn’t? (The government measures both: The unemployment rate is based on how many people either have or don’t have jobs, while the number of jobs added or lost is counted separately).\n\nEach month, the government surveys about 121,000 businesses and government agencies at over 630,000 locations — including multiple locations for the same business — covering about one-third of all workers.\n\nStill, the government also has to make estimates: What if a company goes out of business? It likely won’t fill out any forms showing the jobs lost. And what about new businesses? They can take a while to get on the government’s radar.\n\nThe BLS seeks to capture these trends by estimating their impact on employment. Those estimates can be wrong, of course, until they are fixed by the annual revisions.\n\nThe revisions are often larger around turning points in the economy. For example, when the economy is growing, there may be more startups than the government expects, so revisions will be higher. If the economy is slowing or slipping into a recession, the revisions may be larger on the downside.\n\nHere’s why the May and June revisions may have been so large\n\nErnie Tedeschi, an economic adviser to the Biden administration, points to the current dynamics of the labor market: Both hiring and firing have sharply declined, and fewer Americans are quitting their jobs to take other work. As a result, most of the job gains or losses each month are probably occurring at new companies, or those going out of business.\n\nAnd those are the ones the government uses models to estimate, which can make them more volatile.\n\nGroshen also points out that since the pandemic there has been a surge of new start-up companies, after many Americans lost their jobs or sought more independence. Yet they may not have created as many jobs as startups did pre-COVID, which throws off the government’s models.\n\nRevisions seem to be getting bigger\n\nThe revisions to May and June’s job totals, which reduced hiring by a total of 258,000, were the largest — outside recessions — since 1967, according to economists at Goldman Sachs.\n\nKevin Hassett, Trump’s top economic adviser, went on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday and said, “What we’ve seen over the last few years is massive revisions to the jobs numbers.”\n\nHassett blamed a sharp drop in response rates to the government’s surveys during and after the pandemic: “When COVID happened, because response rates went down a lot, then revision rates skyrocketed.”\n\nYet calculations by Tedeschi show that while revisions spiked after the pandemic, they have since declined and are much smaller than in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nOther concerns about the government’s data\n\nMany economists and statisticians have sounded the alarm about things like declining response rates for years.

The United Kingdom has even suspended publication of an official unemployment rate because of falling responses.\n\nAnd earlier this year the BLS said that it was cutting back on its collection of inflation data because of the Trump administration’s hiring freeze, raising concerns about the robustness of price data just as economists are trying to gauge the impact of tariffs on inflation.\n\nU.S. government statistical agencies have seen an inflation-adjusted 16% drop in funding since 2009, according to a July report from the American Statistical Association.\n\n“We are at an inflection point,” the report said. “To meet current and future challenges requires thoughtful, well-planned investment … In contrast, what we have observed is uncoordinated and unplanned reductions with no visible plan for the future.","summary":"Economists and Wall Street investors have long considered the job figures reliable.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/08/04/us-jobs-report-explainer/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Jobs_Report_Explainer_60580.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-04 23:34:17","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.401},{"id":348173142,"title":"How reliable is the jobs data?

It’s great. It’s funny and it’s witty and it’s very, very sharp.”\n\nA week after the show's final episode aired, Dr Kristen actress Herbers shared the clip on Twitter, adding: “OK, can we do the pick up now?

Trump slammed McEntarfer, an appointee of President Joe Biden, in a Friday Truth Social post claiming she ‘manipulated’ figures to fit a political agenda and called for her ouster.\n\nIt came after the BLS monthly jobs report for July came out and showed it yielding a below-expectations-number of just 73,000 jobs. Trump says it is ‘fake’ and went on a social media tirade against McEntarfer and the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for not bowing to his pressure to lower rates. ‘When [Trump] gets news he doesn’t like, he needs someone to blame because he won’t take the responsibility himself,’ Christie told CNN on Sunday. ‘And this is the action of a petulant child. Like, you give me bad news, I fire the messenger.’\n\nOther Republicans and Trump allies are not happy that the president’s ire was taken out on McEntarfer. Republican Sen. Cyndia Lummis of Wyoming said if the numbers are accurate and she was still fired: ‘That’s a problem.’ ‘These are turbulent times and we’ve created some of the turbulence, and so it should be expected that there would be some ups-and-downs associated with job market,’ Lummis admitted to reporters on Capitol Hill. North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said Trump and those who decided to fire McEntarfer ‘ought to grow up.’\n\nTrump-appointed BLS Commissioner William Beach said it’s not the fault of the commissioner if jobs are initially reported incorrectly, and on X he called her firing ‘groundless.’ ‘The commissioner doesn’t do anything to collect the numbers. The commissioner doesn’t see the numbers until Wednesday before they’re published,’ Beach told CNN on Sunday. ‘By the time the commissioner sees the numbers, they’re all prepared.’ In a post on Sunday, Trump accused McEntarfer of intentionally over-reporting job growth before the 2024 presidential election. He claimed that McEntarfer overstated job growth by 818,000 for the year ending March 2024 and by 112,000 in August and September of last year.\n\nThe president insists the more positive reporting was done intentionally to boost Vice President Kamala Harris’ chances of winning in the 2024 election. It’s standard procedure for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to issue revisions due to lags and complexities of gathering job numbers reports from more than 600,000 businesses. The adjustments are made to reflect more accurate figures once they are available. Former officials, including Beach, have stated revisions are routine and not an inherent indication of manipulation.\n\n‘These were records — No one can be that wrong?’ Trump posted to Truth Social on Friday. ‘We need accurate jobs numbers.’ ‘She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can’t be manipulated for political purposes,’ he continued. But Beach warned that Trump has ‘undermined credibility’ and that no one he appoints to lead BLS will be trusted. ‘Suppose that they get a new commissioner and this person, male or female, are just the best people possible. \n\nAnd they do a bad number. Well, everybody’s going to think, well, it’s not as bad as it probably really is because they’re going to suspect political influence,’ Beach explained. U.S. hiring growth dropped dramatically last month and unemployment ticked up, the latest jobs report released on Friday showed. Non-farm payrolls added 73,000 in July, more than 25 percent lower than the 100,000 expected by analysts. The unemployment rate also ticked up to 4.2 percent. The report also sharply revised down the figures for May and June by a combined 258,000 jobs from the previously released figures.\n\nFollowing the revision June’s total was left at just 14,000 and May’s at 19,000 — effectively flat. Analysts say July’s figure is also likely to be revised lower, possibly into negative territory. The latest figures suggest cracks are in fact starting to show up in the economy, despite a slew of previous better-than-expected economic data released recently. It comes after the Federal Reserve once again held rates steady at its July meeting on Wednesday.\n\nThe weaker figures could incentivize the Fed to lower interest rates at its next meeting in September, something Trump has been pleading for during most of his second term. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has consistently declined to heed Trump’s calls as he continues to monitor possible inflation from tariffs. ‘Higher tariffs have begun to show through more clearly to prices of some goods, but their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remain to be seen,’ Powell told reporters, noting that inflation could be short-lived or more persistent.\n\nAccording to her LinkedIn bio, McEntarfer previously served as an economist at the Census Bureau and at the Treasury Department, as well as working as a senior economist at the Council of Economic Advisors for a year during the Biden administration. Her bio statement is a dry statement filled with economics lingo. ‘My research is focused on labor market dynamics and interactions between firms and workers in the economy and has been published in the Journal of Labor Economics, American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, and the Journal of Economic Perspectives,’ she writes. ‘I have spent over 20 years as a professional economist working on issues related to economic measurement and innovations in workforce data,’ she states.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump &#8216;s friend-turned-foe Chris Christie says the president is constantly looking&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Republicans criticize Trump for dismissing the head of Labor Statistics first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/world-news/republicans-criticize-trump-for-dismissing-the-head-of-labor-statistics/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/rewrite-this-title-Trump-slammed-by-Republicans-after-firing-Labor.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-04 22:50:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.385},{"id":348178196,"title":"Democrats just got their dream candidate in North Carolina. Here are four other Senate seats likely to flip","text":"Congress is officially in recess. \n\nAfter a long slog to pass President Donald Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” a drawn-out fight about nominees and an impasse on how to handle the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune cut the House and Senate loose to go back to their homes and constituents. \n\nAugust recesses are incredibly useful times for lawmakers because they allow them to not only sell their legislative accomplishments, but gauge what the vibe will be like in the upcoming midterm election. \n\nBut Republicans have their work cut out for them. Midterms are always a referendum on the president and how unhappy voters are with him. Just ask Bill Clinton after 1994, George W. Bush after 2006, Barack Obama after 2010 and 2014 and, well, Trump after 2018. \n\nEach time, the party outside of the White House flipped at least one chamber. \n\nTrump knows this, which is why he wanted Texas Republicans to redraw their congressional districts, which led Democrats in the state house to decamp to blue states like Illinois and New York. \n\nBut Democrats have a harder time flipping the Senate. For one, they have to defend Senate seats in states that Trump won in 2024, such as Michigan and Georgia. On top of that, their best shot at flipping a Senate seat is in North Carolina, which has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 2008.\n\nA few months ago, The Independent ranked the Senate seats most likely to flip. Since then, plenty has changed. \n\nDemocrats have coalesced around Chris Pappas in New Hampshire, while Republicans have gotten behind Scott Brown, who only won a fluke race in 2010 in Massachusetts. As a result, we’re taking the Granite State off the list and replacing it with Texas, which has a chance to flip thanks to an intra-GOP blood feud. \n\nHere are the five Senate seats most likely to turn:\n\n1. North Carolina \n\nTrump’s feud with Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) about the One Big, Beautiful Bill’s cuts to Medicaid ended in the worst way possible for Republicans: Tillis deciding to not seek re-election in a super-swingy state. \n\nIn response, Democrats got their dream candidate: former governor Roy Cooper, a popular two-term governor, who won races in 2016 and 2020 when Trump was at the top of the ticket. \n\nThe fact he also expanded Medicaid as governor with the help of Republicans offers a contrast after Trump signed steep cuts to the health care program. He’s already proven to be a prolific fundraiser. \n\nOn the GOP side, Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law who grew up in Wilmington, passed on running. Now, Michael Whatley, the former state GOP chairman and Republican National Committee chairman, is the presumptive nominee. So far, an Emerson College poll shows Cooper up by six points. \n\nBut as is the case in college basketball, North Carolina loves tight races. \n\n2. Georgia \n\nSen. Jon Ossoff is the youngest senator and the most vulnerable incumbent Democrat, not least because he represents a state Trump won. \n\nRepublicans have put a massive target on his back. But so far, they also have a crowded primary to replace him. \n\nRep. Buddy Carter has jumped in, as has Rep. Mike Collins, who will occupy the more MAGA lane of the GOP, though he notably misspelled the name of his state in his announcement ad.\n\nDerek Dooley, the former University of Tennessee head football coach and the son of University of Georgia head coach Vince Dooley, also announced his run on Monday. \n\nAnd a crowded primary could risk disaster if the three men spend their time attacking each other instead of the Democrat. Ossoff has a fairly prodigious war chest, raising $9.1 million last fundraising quarter. \n\nExpect Republicans to also attack him on immigration and Israel. Ossoff voted for the Laken Riley Act, named for a University of Georgia student killed in Athens, that Collins wrote. But last week, he voted with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on one of his resolutions to withhold arms sales to Israel.\n\nOn paper, Susan Collins should be the most vulnerable incumbent senator. She is the only Republican from a state Kamala Harris won. She’s 72 and has voted for many of Trump’s most controversial nominees like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard. \n\nAnd Trump attacked her last week. \n\nBut there’s just one problem: Collins’s universal name recognition in Maine and the fact she has pulled off a miracle win in 2020 means few big-name Democrats have stepped up to run against her. Collins has also proven to be deft at her job. \n\nShe is chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, meaning she can bring money back to her state, voted against confirming Pete Hegseth to lead the Pentagon and opposed the One Big, Beautiful Bill while also beefing up its rural hospital fund. Jordan Wood, a former House chief of staff, has raised a large amount of money. But for now, it’s still an uphill climb for Democrats. \n\n4. Michigan\n\nOn the Republican side, Michigan Republicans have essentially agreed to nominate former congressman Mike Rogers, who barely lost to Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich,). The real fight will be on the Democratic primary side. \n\nMichigan, which has a large concentration of Arab-American voters, became a source of heartburn for Democrats during the war in Gaza because of Joe Biden’s vocal, diplomatic and military support for Israel. Plenty of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents simply chose to sit out the race, which likely cost them the race.\n\nExpect Israel to play a big role. Rep. Haley Stevens would start out as the establishment favorite, with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee quietly saying she’d be the best candidate, CNN reported. But some progressives worry that she has received a large amount from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. \n\nBy contrast, Mallory McMorrow, the Democratic whip in the state senate, who occupies the lane of suburban well-educated white voters. Abdul El-Sayed, who ran for governor in 2018, will represent the progressive wing . \n\nAs is the case with Georgia, Democrats risk a primary where they cannibalize each other and risk losing a seat in a state they where a Republican hasn’t won a Senate race since 1994. \n\nTexas is causing the biggest headaches for Republicans. \n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) should be a shoe-in to win re-election. But Ken Paxton, the state’s attorney general, announced he would run. Paxton has been under federal indictment almost as soon as he became attorney general in 2015. The Texas state house impeached him and last month, his wife, state senator Angela Paxton, announced she would divorce him on “bibilical grounds.” \n\nBut MAGA loves him, particularly for his attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. \n\nConservatives also don’t like that Cornyn negotiated a gun bill with Democrats immediately after the shooting in Uvalde in 2022. Republicans fear a Paxton victory would risk Democrats flipping a Senate seat in a place they haven’t won a Senate seat since 1988. \n\nEverything has to go right for Democrats in the Lone Star State. Whether it be Colin Allred, who lost to Ted Cruz and is deciding to run it back, or Terry Virts, a retired astronaut. But occasionally, miracles happen, even in Texas.","summary":"Can anyone step up in Maine against Susan Collins?

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has made threats about removing members of the opposition from their seats. Democrats have countered that Abbott is using “smoke and mirrors” to assert legal authority he does not have.\n\nThe Republican-dominated House quickly issued civil arrest warrants for absent members and Abbott ordered state troopers to help find and arrest them, but Democrats who are not in Texas are beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities.\n\n“If you continue to go down this road, there will be consequences,” House Speaker Rep. Dustin Burrows said from the chamber floor, later telling reporters that includes fines.\n\nThe Democratic revolt and Abbott’s threats ratcheted up a widening fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but expanded to include Democratic governors who have floated the possibility of rushing to redraw their own state maps in retaliation, even if their options are limited. The dispute also offered another example of Trump’s aggressive view of presidential power and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the longstanding balance of powers between the federal government and individual states.\n\nAt the center of the escalating impasse is Trump’s hope of adding five more GOP-leaning congressional seats in Texas before the upcoming midterms. That would bolster his party’s chances of preserving its slim U.S. House majority, something Republicans were unable to do in the 2018 midterms during Trump’s first presidency. Republicans currently hold 25 of Texas’ 38 seats. That’s nearly a 2-to-1 advantage and already a wider partisan gap than in the 2024 presidential election, when Trump won 56.1% of the vote, while Democrat Kamala Harris received 42.5%.\n\nSpeaking Monday on the Fox News show “America’s Newsroom,” Abbott essentially admitted to the partisan power play, noting that the U.S. Supreme Court has determined “there is nothing illegal” about shaping districts to a majority party’s advantage. He even openly acknowledged it as “gerrymandering” before correcting himself to say Texas is “drawing lines.”\n\nMore than 1,800 miles away from Austin, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul appeared with Texas Democrats and argued that their cause should be national.\n\n“We’re not going to tolerate our democracy being stolen in a modern-day stagecoach heist by a bunch of law breaking cowboys,” Hochul said Monday, flanked by several of the lawmakers who left Texas. “If Republicans are willing to rewrite rules to give themselves an advantage, then they’re leaving us with no choice: We must do the same. You have to fight fire with fire.”\n\nTexas Dems say they are ‘in this for the long haul’\n\nAbbott insisted ahead of Monday’s scheduled session that lawmakers have “absconded” in violation of their sworn duties to the state.\n\n“I believe they have forfeited their seats in the state Legislature because they are not doing the job they were elected to do,” he said in the Fox News interview, invoking his state’s hallmark machismo to call the lawmakers “un-Texan.”\n\n“Texans don’t run from a fight,” he said.\n\nDemocrats said they had no plans to heed the governor’s demands.\n\n“He has no legal mechanism,” said Texas Rep. Jolanda Jones, one of the lawmakers who was in New York on Monday. “Subpoenas from Texas don’t work in New York, so he can’t come and get us. Subpoenas in Texas don’t work in Chicago. … He’s putting up smoke and mirrors.”\n\nA refusal by Texas lawmakers to show up is a civil violation of legislative rules. As for his threat to remove the lawmakers, Abbott cited a nonbinding legal opinion issued by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton amid an partisan quorum dispute in 2021. Paxton suggested a court could determine that a legislator had forfeited their office.\n\nPaxton, who is running for U.S. Senate, said on X that Democrats who “try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately.”\n\nThe Republican response is accelerated compared with the 2021 dispute, when weeks passed before the GOP majority opted for civil arrest warrants.\n\nThe state of the vote\n\nThe lawmakers who left declined to say how long they will hold out.\n\n“The magic of a quorum break is you never telegraph the how long or what you’re going to do,” said Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, who has served in the Legislature since 2001. “We recognized when we got on the plane that we’re in this for the long haul.”\n\nTexas House Democratic Caucus leader Gene Wu said his members “will do whatever it takes” but added, “What that looks like, we don’t know.”\n\nLegislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, including in 2021, when many of the same Texas House Democrats left the state for 38 days to protest new voting restrictions. Once they returned, Republicans still passed that measure.\n\nLawmakers cannot pass bills in the 150-member Texas House without at least two-thirds of them present. Democrats hold 62 of the seats in the majority-Republican chamber, and at least 51 left the state, said Josh Rush Nisenson, spokesperson for the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders had the authority to “physically compel the attendance” of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served. Republicans answered by adopting $500 daily fines for lawmakers who don’t show up for work as punishment.\n\nThe governor, meanwhile, continues to make unsubstantiated claims that some lawmakers have committed felonies by soliciting money to pay for fines they could face for leaving the state to deny a quorum.\n\nDisaster aid and presidential politics are part of the argument\n\nThe lack of a quorum will delay votes on disaster assistance and new warning systems in the wake of last month’s catastrophic floods in Texas that killed at least 136 people. Democrats had called for votes on the flooding response before taking up redistricting and have criticized Republicans for not doing so.\n\nOn Fox, Abbott attempted to turn that issue back on Democrats, suggesting their efforts to break a quorum would become the reason for a delayed flood response.\n\nBeyond Texas, some Democrats want to leverage the fight.\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential contender and outspoken Trump critic, welcomed Texas Democrats to Chicago on Sunday after having been in quiet talks with them for weeks. Pritzker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, another potential 2028 contender, held public events about the Texas fight before the quorum break.\n\n“This is not just rigging the system in Texas,” Pritzker said Sunday night. “It’s about rigging the system against the rights of all Americans for years to come.”\n\nThe Texas House is scheduled to convene again Tuesday afternoon.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

In an interview with Fox News Digital, Burr, who is chair of the Coalition for Smarter Regulation of Nicotine, said that even as the Biden administration cracked down on \"reputable\" companies like Juul, it took no action to control the flow of off-brand competitor products, most of which were manufactured and exported to the U.S. by Chinese companies through the open borders. \"There was not a policy in the Biden administration to enforce the law at the border. And that's where the growth really came from,\" he explained, adding, \"They not only didn't speak out against them, but they didn't make any attempt, any attempt, at enforcement.\" According to Burr, Biden’s director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products (CTP), Brian King, bears special blame for overseeing an agency so crippled by inaction that, Burr said, \"most of the products that are on the marketplace today not only are illegal, they have never even attempted to go through an application process at the FDA.\" However, a spokesperson for King vehemently denied Burr's assertions, telling Fox News Digital that \"the claim that there was no attempt at enforcement is not consistent with the facts.\" KAMALA HARRIS BACK IN NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT AS JAMES COMER FLOATS SUBPOENA IN BIDEN 'COVER-UP' PROBE Burr said that currently approximately 85% of vapor and e-cigarette products sold in the U.S. are either illicit or unauthorized due to the Biden FDA’s failure to enforce the law. Now, Burr is urging the Trump administration to be proactive in fixing the Chinese nicotine problem unleashed on Americans under Biden. Burr sent a letter to Trump’s FDA commissioner, Martin Makary, as well as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, urging them to take urgent action to \"restore order\" to the marketplace by reforming the government’s review process of nicotine and e-cigarette products and then fully enforcing against the entities responsible for growing the illicit market. In his letter, Burr describes the U.S. as being \"in the midst of a crisis created by the free flow of illegal nicotine products into the U.S. marketplace, the majority of which are supplied by Chinese companies that are knowingly breaking U.S. laws.\" 'WAS THE PRESIDENT UP FOR THE JOB?' STEVE RICCHETTI DEFENDS BIDEN’S FITNESS AS GOP SEEKS ANSWERS \"During the Biden Administration, illicit Chinese vaping products, without any regulatory oversight or consumer protections, began flooding our market,\" Burr wrote. \"Produced overseas without meeting FDA safety standards or common tobacco product manufacturing practices, these illicit vapor products are deliberately avoiding compliance with the law, and many are intentionally marketed to underage users with youth-appealing features, for example, Gummy Bear flavors and gaming device screens.\" Burr further said that manufacturers of illicit vaping products often use fraudulent shipping declarations and misclassified tariff codes to evade U.S. customs and trade laws. \"President Trump has rightfully warned that counterfeit pharmaceutical products, often linked to the People’s Republic of China, threaten the security and safety of Americans,\" he wrote. \"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the opportunity to address a similar crisis in the nicotine market by advancing a modern and common-sense approach to regulating nicotine products and effectively enforcing the Tobacco Control Act (TCA) to restore order to the marketplace.\" To this end, Burr urged the FDA to \"advance a comprehensive, effective regulatory framework,\" which he said consists of streamlining the FDA’s approval process for less harmful smoke-free nicotine products, providing clear regulations to the industry and enforcing the law against companies selling illicit products, providing adult smokers with accurate information on the benefits of switching from cigarettes to FDA-authorized, smoke-free products and using regulation and oversight to drive down underage use. INSIDE THE BIDEN COVER-UP PROBE: 8 AIDES QUESTIONED, MORE ON THE WAY Speaking with Fox News Digital, Burr said that both Kennedy and President Donald Trump \"have embraced a healthier America that our kids should be eating healthier, should be actively involved, and we should make sure that anything that's detrimental to their ability to grow and to grow up healthy should be constricted significantly.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"This is at the heart of that,\" he said.

This was in addition to other first of their kind actions across the supply chain focused on unauthorized products from non-US manufacturers, including monthly retailer blitzes against Elf Bar and other unauthorized disposable e-cigarette brands used by youth,\" they said. \"The FDA and other agencies should build on these efforts and take comprehensive enforcement action against illegal e-cigarettes, particularly those popular among youth,\" said the spokesperson.","summary":"Chinese-made nicotine and e-cigarette products illegally flooded U.S. markets under former President Joe Biden, endangering both adults and children, according to former GOP senator Richard Burr.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/exclusive-biden-failed-stop-chinas-toxic-nicotine-invasion-your-kids-paid-price-expert-warns","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/biden-nicotine.png","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6375714181112","publish_date":"2025-08-04 21:24:57","author":"Peter Pinedo","authors":["Peter Pinedo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.486},{"id":348173824,"title":"Exclusive—‘Breaking the Law’: Expose Reveals Biden White House Orchestrated Lawfare Against Trump to Rig 2024 Election","text":"The Joe Biden White House orchestrated the lawfare against President Donald Trump in the run-up to the 2024 election, hoping to jail or bankrupt the Republican standard bearer in order to prevent him from becoming president of the United States. The fact-pattern that I establish in my new book, Breaking the Law: Exposing the Weaponization of America’s Legal System Against Donald Trump, reveals a vast conspiracy to use lawfare to rig the race by engaging in an unprecedented level of coordination across branches of government, Democrat power structures, and the White House itself.\n\nTheir plan was simple and devious: If they could not stop Trump at the ballot box, they would stop him in the courtroom. Biden gave it away in a candid moment in October 2024: “We gotta lock him up.” (Trump used similar language about Hillary Clinton, but only as campaign rhetoric when his power over the country’s legal infrastructure was nonexistent). It was a widely held belief in Biden’s inner circle that Trump would be in prison before election day 2024. It was just a matter of making sure he got there.\n\nHad the Democrats succeeded and stopped Trump from being elected, it would easily qualify as the biggest political scandal in modern political history. Thus far, however, there has been no accountability delivered to any of the main lawfare practitioners that was not administered by the voters themselves.\n\nThe full scope of the White House’s specific effort to subvert our democracy to orchestrate the jailing of their main political opponent will require subpoenas and investigations carried out by the Congress and/or the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC). These investigations can and should begin immediately.\n\nWithout accountability or consequences, it is a guarantee that they will use the same playbook to subvert our democracy in future elections. It is already happening.\n\nBreaking the Law details a brief history of modern lawfare before I launch into investigations into the six major cases against Donald Trump that played out between his two administrations. (I also lay out the ongoing threat of rogue district judges and prosecutors who have abandoned the concept of law and order to stop Donald Trump and the MAGA agenda.)\n\nOf the six cases, four were criminal and designed to jail Trump, and two were civil and devised to bankrupt him. All were deliberately intended to consume time, focus, and resources. He was often forced to campaign from a courthouse.\n\nThis was the design.\n\nEach of the six major cases I profile in the book has a direct connection to the Joe Biden White House.\n\nBefore examining those, it is important to state at the outset that President Biden could have shut them all down at any point, but he chose not to. “This is a Biden prosecution,” President Trump said. “It’s election interference at a level that nobody in this country has ever seen before.”\n\nTrump is correct. If Joe Biden had suggested this was an unfair targeted prosecution at any point, the charges certainly would have been dropped and America could have resumed our tradition of free and fair elections.\n\nBut he did not, of course, because he knew that his best chance to retain the White House was to make sure Donald Trump was campaigning from a court house — and headed for a jailhouse.\n\nThere were unique circumstances in each of the six major cases against Trump that suggest White House involvement as well as the involvement of top tier Democratic politicians and donors. I share some of them here, delineated by each case.\n\nThe Stormy Daniels ‘Hush Money’ Case\n\nFirst of all, this case was not about “hush money,” which is not illegal nor does it guarantee guilt. The case was actually about falsifying business records. I write in Breaking the Law that this was the single weakest case against Trump, yet it was the only one that ended in a (actually thirty-four) felony conviction.\n\nThe case was headed up by Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg, who ran a campaign bankrolled by George Soros and had the explicit intention of going after Trump if Bragg was elected. Bragg repeatedly and falsely claimed that he had sued Trump over 100 times during before his election. Even the New York Times noted that he broke lawyerly protocol by publicly fantasizing about taking down Trump.\n\nThe Judge presiding over the trial was Juan Merchan, a small-dollar Biden donor himself (this is illegal), who has a daughter who was one of the Democrat’s biggest fundraisers. Loren Merchan is president of a Chicago-based leftist consulting firm, Authentic Campaigns, which counts the Senate Majority PAC, a major fundraiser for Democrats, and then-Congressman Adam Schiff as clients. The New York Post reported in March 2024 that Loren Merchan’s consultancy had raised at least $93 million in campaign donations for the election cycle.\n\nFor her father to preside over a trial where Trump is the defendant in an election is, as Trump put it to me, “the greatest conflict of interest of all time.”\n\nYet, the clearest evidence that the Biden administration was actively involved in the case was that Bragg’s lead prosecutor, Matthew Colangelo, had left his principal deputy associate attorney general job in Biden’s DOJ (he was the third-ranking official at the Department of Justice out of more than 100,000 people!). Colangelo, who has a pristine resumé and was in a job at the DOJ that would has been a steppingstone for Supreme Court Justices and Cabinet Secretaries but instead took a massive demotion, taking a job that lawyers might get fresh out of college.\n\n“It’s the rough equivalent of like a four-star general in the army, quitting his job and enlisting in the National Guard as a private,” said Will Scharf, the White House staff secretary and one of Trump’s attorneys.\n\nOn November 9, Joe Biden held a press conference and said, “We just have to demonstrate that he [Trump] will not take power, if he does run, making sure he, under legitimate efforts of our Constitution, does not become the next president again.”\n\nDays later, Colangelo was moved from the top of the DOJ to Bragg’s courtroom.\n\nThis is not a coincidence.\n\nFani Willis’s Failed RICO Case Against Trump\n\nOn November 18, right around when Colangelo would have put in his two weeks notice to the DOJ, Nathan Wade, prosecutor for and boyfriend of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, was at the White House meeting with counsel for eight hours.\n\nWhy was Nathan Wade at the White House?\n\nWade was a family law attorney—that means his area of law is divorces and prenuptial agreements—with no prosecution experience. He was appointed by Willis without any checks or oversight that would have questioned his qualifications. He had zero background in RICO law, the most relevant area of the law for Willis’s prosecution. In fact, he admitted that he had to study up on it.\n\nNathan Wade met with the White House counsel at least twice. He billed the Fulton DA’s office for eight hours from the White House on at least two separate occasions: May 23, 2022, and on November 18, 2022, both before Trump was indicted. (The case should have been thrown out in January 2024 when this was revealed.)\n\nWade has refused to say what was discussed in these White House meetings, but what could the subject possibly have been other than the indictment of Trump? Wade’s career to that point was completely unimpressive. He was a nobody. There is no plausible reason he would have had multiple eight-hour meetings at Biden’s White House if they weren’t specifically working on something big together.\n\nFani Willis herself reportedly had a five-hour meeting at the White House with Vice President Kamala Harris months before the indictment. The meeting occurred on February 28, 2023, months after Wade’s meetings but months before the August indictment.\n\nSources told Breitbart News that a former Biden White House aide, Jeff DeSantis, who had become Fulton County’s Deputy District Attorney, was tasked as liaison between the White House and the Willis office.\n\nHe is the first person who needs to be brought in for questioning.\n\nJack Smith, the Unconstitutional Special Counsel\n\nAt the exact moment Colangelo would have put in his resignation at the DOJ and Nathan Wade was at the White House, Attorney General Merrick Garland’s DOJ announced the appointment of Jack Smith as special counsel to investigate President Trump.\n\nThere is no scenario on Earth where Joe Biden and his White House had not coordinated with Garland before the special counsel was announced.\n\nTo investigate a past president looks like an act of retribution or a preemptive strike. In this case, given Trump’s ambitions to retake the White House, it was clearly both. Special counsels are expected to bring charges. This meant a prosecution of Trump was all but a guarantee, carried out by Joe Biden’s Justice Department using his own political employees.\n\nSmith was best known for high-profile prosecutions such as that of former Virginia governor Robert McDonnell, a Republican. Smith, on behalf of the Obama administration, tried McDonnell for violating the federal bribery statute. Smith got his conviction, but it was overturned by a unanimous, 8–0 Supreme Court decision, a massive embarrassment. Smith left the country in 2018 to police the international community for the International Criminal Court (a kangaroo court if there ever was one).\n\nSmith was a known partisan and staffed up his team with Joe Biden and Barack Obama donors.\n\nHis appointment was ultimately ruled unconstitutional (the epic story of how Trump’s team discovered this angle and beat Smith with it is told in great detail in Breaking the Law). Smith and his team were either coordinating with the Biden administration on the investigations (which is blatant election interference), or Smith wasn’t coordinating with anyone at all, meaning he essentially had infinite power. This is obviously illegal and his office was shut down.\n\nDespite his job never being legitimate, he operated for 18 months as though he had the full force of the federal government behind him while he tried to politically assassinate Donald Trump.\n\nSmith continued to release illicitly obtained information and documents throughout the election season and beyond, a blatant attempt to interfere in our democracy.\n\nE. Jean Carroll’s Attempt to Bankrupt Trump\n\nThe most absurd of the six cases I investigated for Breaking the Law is the civil defamation case brought by columnist E. Jean Carroll. Regardless of the surreal facts of the case (they need to be read to be believed!) Trump still had no hope of winning once the judge and jury were set in New York. “If I had F. Lee Bailey in his prime it wouldn’t have mattered,” Trump told me, referring to the famed criminal attorney known for architecting O. J. Simpson’s successful defense, among other high-profile cases.\n\n“They tried to embarrass me before the election,” Trump added.\n\nBy “they,” he’s talking about the Democrats’ lawfare superstructure, and there is yet again a Joe Biden connection. The suit was funded by Democrat megadonor Reid Hoffman and orchestrated by anti-Trump TV pundit and lawyer George Conway.\n\nConway is professional anti-Trump legal pundit and bitter ex-husband of Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway. He introduced the idea to Carroll of pursuing a civil case against Trump.\n\nHoffman hates Trump, saying he would “spend as much as I possibly can and it takes” to beat him. And he just so happens to have been the one shoveling coal into E. Jean Carroll’s engine. Carroll’s legal team, led by Roberta Kaplan, disclosed that they were funded by American Future Republic, a nonprofit primarily backed by Hoffman.\n\nThe story of the E. Jean Carroll lawsuit is simple: A far-left billionaire attempted to buy the election via lawfare involving E. Jean Carroll.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just any billionaire. Hoffman is a Biden World fixture, a megadonor who visited Biden’s White House five times in 2022 alone, a dramatic year in the E. Jean Carroll saga.\n\n“In business and politics, some people reach their greatest achievements in their 80s or even their 90s. Joe Biden has those qualities,” Hoffman said of Biden while urging Democrats to continue to give to him.\n\nEven their 90s! As a staunch supporter of Joe Biden and a frequent guest of the White House, Hoffman also funded one of the cases to try to take out Trump while he was routinely in meetings at the White House.\n\nTish James and Trump’s Property Value\n\nLetitia “Tish” James is a partisan Democrat who ran and won her race for New York Attorney General specifically to try to destroy Trump. She is one of the most open and public practitioners of lawfare featured in the book. She once told a group of New York Democrats that “I look forward to going into the office of the Attorney General every day, suing [Trump], and then going home.” She uses the law to advance political goals, and she doesn’t hide that fact. Despite rising crime in New York during her tenure as state AG, she seems entirely fixated on getting Trump.\n\nJames accused Trump of inflating his assets to try to get certain benefits for his businesses. There were no victims of the alleged crimes and no damages sought by any entities. But Tish James and liberal judge Arthur Engoron got a judgment that Trump was liable for nearly half-a-billion dollars anyway, a cruel and unusual punishment obviously designed to bankrupt him or force him to liquidate assets amid the election cycle.\n\nNot only are there direct ties to the Biden White House in this case, there was an apparent connection to Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) as well. A photo of Engoron’s top clerk, Allison Greenfield, and Schumer surfaced online, leading Trump to declare “Schumer’s girlfriend, Alison R. Greenfield, is running this case against me.”\n\nGreenfield had donated to Democrat candidates in amounts exceeding New York State ethics rules. Breitbart’s Matthew Boyle initially reported this story. There is no evidence she was ever disciplined for this.\n\nCourt officials were not allowed to donate in excess of $500 in aggregate donations in a calendar year. The database suggested that Greenfield’s donations exceeded that threshold many times over.\n\nIn an exclusive interview in the Oval Office in 2025, Trump told me he believed she was behind the entire trial, saying she had total control over Judge Engoron. Trump believed she had her future mapped out, and it started with a big victory against Trump. “She thought Biden was going to win,” he said, and then she is “going to be a federal judge.”\n\nBiden did not win.\n\nDuring the course of her investigation into Trump, Tish James visited the White House multiple times. Publicly available records show that James visited the White House on April 8, 2022, for a celebration of Ketanji Brown Jackson; July 18, 2022, to meet with Kamala Harris along with other attorneys general; and August 31, 2023, for an event honoring black women. The establishment media have been entirely dismissive that she could have also taken other meetings to discuss Trump’s trial during these visits.\n\nThis New York attorney general has always sought to destroy Trump and was clearly abusing her power to do so, all the while making trips to the White House.\n\nShe would win her case and get a cruel and unusual penalty assessed to Trump for a victimless crime.\n\nNeedless to say, the Joe Biden White House did not object.\n\nThe evidence that the Joe Biden White House was heavily involved in the lawfare against Donald Trump is overwhelming. The Biden White House coordinated an effort to subvert democracy by jailing and/or bankrupting the standard bearer of his rival party. No one has been investigated for it, as far as I can tell, much less held to account.\n\nIf this is allowed to stand, it is the end of law and order and “democracy” as we know it.\n\nSo, we must act. Investigations, subpoenas, depositions. We must get all records and map the coordination across the White House, DOJ, the DAs, the AGs, the donors, etc. to reveal the full extent of the conspiracy.\n\nOnly then can justice actually begin to be served for President Trump and his supporters.\n\nBreaking the Law: Exposing the Weaponization of America’s Legal System Against Donald Trump, which has been hailed by President Trump as a “must read” book, is available for pre-order now in hardcover and eReader format and will also be available as an audiobook read by the author himself.\n\nAlex Marlow is the editor-in-chief of Breitbart News, a two-time New York Times bestselling author, and the host of “The Alex Marlow Show” podcast produced weekdays by Breitbart News and Salem Podcast Network.

Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta, California has gotten a bang for its buck through the state’s torrent of litigation against the Trump administration.\n\nThe two Democrats appeared at a news conference Monday to tout and defend Bonta’s whopping 37 lawsuits against the Republican administration, a rate of more than one per week since Trump took office in January.\n\nThe lawsuits have aimed to release withheld federal funding for schools, public health, electric vehicles and more, as well as to try to thwart cuts to federal agencies and programs. Some California Republicans have condemned the lawsuits as frivolous and motivated by politics, while Democrats say they’re sadly necessary to keep the state running and defend their legislative priorities.\n\nThe Bay Area News Group reported in July that the litigation had secured the release of at least $168 billion in federal funds and a slew of temporary pauses on Trump administration initiatives. The windfall continues to swell. Bonta on Monday hailed another recent court victory that forced the Trump administration to release about $1 billion for education programs in California. One program that was frozen, the Migrant Education Program, was created by Congress in the 1960s to ensure children of migrant farm workers receive proper instruction and prepare for “responsible citizenship.”\n\n“What we’re demanding is that we get the funding that’s already been legally approved and appropriated to our state,” Bonta said. “The money is critical and it touches every corner of California.”\n\nOther victories so far include the release of $300 million for electric vehicle chargers and another nearly $1 billion for public health programs such as infectious disease tracking and immunizations, Bonta said.\n\nThe attorney general hasn’t always prevailed, though. Bonta unsuccessfully sued to halt Trump’s tariffs and stop deployments of Marines and National Guard to Los Angeles, for example.\n\nAccording to Bonta, 13 court orders are currently pausing Trump’s initiatives as a result of the legal campaign. That can change quickly as cases wind through the courts; the fate of the vast majority of Bonta’s lawsuits are still in question.\n\nNewsom said on Monday he stood behind Bonta. Soon after Trump’s victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris in November, the governor convened a special session of the California Legislature to push through an emergency allocation of $25 million for Bonta’s Department of Justice and local prosecutors to challenge Trump initiatives in court.\n\nOf that, $5 million went to the Justice department. Lawmakers then doled out another $14 million for litigation in the current budget. The agency added 20 more attorneys to work on these cases with the funds.\n\n“California’s early, proactive and defensive actions have helped California maintain its values in the face of wholesale attacks against our families and communities, while also serving as a backstop against tyrannical actions by President Trump and those who aim to ignore the rule of law,” Newsom said in a statement. “As the federal government continues to attack our state, California will keep defending itself, its values and its people.”\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment. A message for California Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley, a frequent critic of Newsom, was not returned by deadline.\n\nState Republicans opposed the special legislative session this winter and argued that it was unnecessary. After the deadly Los Angeles firestorm in January, political analysts also said Newsom’s adversarial stance could imperil the governor’s attempts to appease Trump and win federal disaster aid. Their relationship, which is usually adversarial, has since soured, although Newsom says often that he is happy to work with the president.\n\nHowever, even a top Republican critic of Newsom, Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones of San Diego, told Bay Area News Group last month that it made sense to “fight for our share of federal funding.” Newsom has argued Californians provide $83 billion more to the federal government than they receive from the federal government.\n\nBonta’s predecessor and fellow Democrat Xavier Becerra filed 122 lawsuits against Trump’s first administration, which released billions of dollars in federal funding for California. Exactly how much is unclear. The Attorney General’s office said it does not keep track of that litigation, much of which was dropped after Trump lost his reelection bid in 2020. Bonta is on pace to exceed Becerra’s volume of litigation.\n\nBonta launched his first volley of litigation the day after Trump took office and signed an executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship. That lawsuit and others filed by Democratic attorneys general initially won sweeping pauses on the order. The U.S. Supreme Court later voided the pauses. Separate litigation continues to prevent it from going into effect for now.\n\nAlong with the lawsuits, California has also filed more than 40 amicus briefs in support of litigation by other attorneys general, Bonta said.\n\nBonta on Monday criticized the Trump administration’s “sweeping campaign to illegally withhold funding and services, to dismantle the government and to strip Californians of their constitutional rights.”\n\n“We’ve been ready to strike back at every turn,” he said.","summary":"California is reaping the benefits of litigation against the Trump administration, according to top Democrats.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/04/newsom-bonta-tout-californias-legal-blitz-against-trump/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SJM-L-CATRUMPSUITS-0805-2_646dc9.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-04 21:10:59","author":"Grant Stringer","authors":["Grant Stringer"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":348151996,"title":"Trump Pits 'Woke' Taylor Swift Against Sydney Sweeney, Saying Pop Star Is for 'Losers' and Calling Sweeney's Ad the 'Hottest'","text":"Donald Trump is pitting Sydney Sweeney and Taylor Swift against each other by casting them as opposing sides of the celebrity coin.\n\n When Trump discovered that Sweeney is a registered Republican while speaking with reporters on Sunday, Aug. 3, he praised the actress and her controversial American Eagle campaign, which has come under fire for its perceived problematic undertones.\n\n In a Truth Social post on Monday morning, the president took his newfound affection for Sweeney a step further by contrasting his appreciation for the actress with his \"hate\" for Swift, who backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n \"Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the 'HOTTEST' ad out there. It’s for American Eagle, and the jeans are 'flying off the shelves.' Go get ‘em Sydney!\" he wrote on Aug. 4.\n\n After slamming ads from other companies like Bud Lite and Jaguar — which Trump described as \"woke\" — the president then shifted the conversation to Swift, who has become a frequent target of his anger over the past year.\n\n \"Just look at Woke singer Taylor Swift,\" he wrote in the post. \"Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can’t stand her (HATE!). She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT.\"\n\n He continued: \"The tide has seriously turned — Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"\n\n The president's modern criticism of Swift escalated after she endorsed Harris for president in September 2024. The endorsement prompted Trump to post: \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\"\n\n Despite Trump's attempts to turn his MAGA followers against Swift, the president's granddaughter Arabella remained a fan of the \"Blank Space\" singer, even celebrating her 13th birthday with mom Ivanka at the Eras Tour in October.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer.\n\n Sweeney's party preference was first reported by Buzzfeed News amid the backlash from her controversial new partnership with American Eagle, though the actress has not commented on her political affiliation or spoken publicly in support of Trump.\n\n The AE ad campaign — called \"Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans\" — played off the word \"genes,\" with critics claiming that it suggested she was genetically superior in the way that it highlighted her blonde hair and blue eyes.\n\n The jeans campaign also drew comparisons to Brooke Shields' controversial Calvin Klein ad from 1980. Shields' age (she was 15 at the time) ruffled feathers due to the commercial's provocative tagline: \"You want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing.\" It also featured similar messaging about passing down characteristics from generation to generation.","summary":"Hours after Trump learned that Sweeney is registered as a Republican, he took to Truth Social to contrast his appreciation for the actress with his \"hate\" for Swift","url":"https://people.com/trump-pits-taylor-swift-against-sydney-sweeney-11784508","image":"https://people.com/thmb/t-fJyrk1pqKBuC03Axwru6zUv6Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(745x387:747x389)/donald-trump-Trump-Turnberry-golf-club-2025-taylor-swift-67th-GRAMMY-Awards-sydney-sweeney-echo-valley-premiere-080425-05","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-04 20:52:32","author":"Rachel Raposas","authors":["Rachel Raposas"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.203},{"id":348149586,"title":"'Squeaky clean' presidential hopeful's shameful marriage secret blown wide open after 36 years","text":"The former North Carolina governor running for Senate had a 'secret' divorce and began dating his second wife while she was still married, Daily Mail can reveal.\n\nRoy Cooper, 68, is at the top of Democrat politics, and was even tipped to replace Joe Biden as a presidential candidate last year and was on the shortlist to be Kamala Harris's 2024 running mate.\n\nBut despite his decades-long prominent standing in the party, Cooper has kept his divorce, and the overlap with his second wife's own first marriage, under wraps – until now.\n\nThe revelation may come as a surprise for a 'squeaky clean' leader once described by left-leaning politics magazine The New Republic as 'the living, breathing antonym of controversy.'\n\nBefore his marriage to current wife Kristin, 69, Cooper was wed to his college sweetheart Georganne Rice, now 65.\n\nBut Rice says he ditched her for a career in politics, without warning.\n\n'He was my orientation counselor when I was a freshman and started at [University of North Carolina] Chapel Hill,' she told the Daily Mail in an exclusive interview.\n\n'We dated starting my sophomore year of college, and then we got married two weeks after I graduated from college in 1981.\n\n'I thought everything was great, until one day he came home and told me that he had signed up to run for state representative.\n\n'We had not discussed it or anything. We were in our mid-20s, and I wanted to start a family. I was completely flabbergasted that he would decide to run. He wouldn't even discuss it with me; he just came home and told me.\n\n'I told Roy, I don't want this life, we didn't discuss this. It was a pretty major life decision.'\n\nAs the young attorney ran his campaign for a state house seat in Raleigh in 1985 and 1986, he and Georganne secretly split, she said.\n\n'I took a promotion and moved to Greenville [North Carolina]. I still came back and went to campaign events for him, because he didn't want anybody to know,' she said.\n\n'But the day he won the election, I told him, if you lose, then we can talk about our marriage. But if you win, I didn't sign up for this. He won, and he's been in politics ever since.\n\n'When he first ran for governor, he called me and said, if somebody contacts you, please don't say anything negative\n\n'I don't wish anything bad on Roy,' she added. 'But my friends think it's funny it's never mentioned that he was married before.\n\n'I had a lot of people texting me when his name was mentioned for Vice President last year, going, \"Do you think he's ever going to acknowledge that y'all were married for over five years?\"\n\n'It's kind of crappy to sign up to run for office and then just come home and tell your wife and not discuss it. So, I can see why he might not want to talk about it.'\n\nDespite his long political career, the only mention of his marriage to Georganne is the 1981 announcement of their wedding in the Rocky Mount Telegram.\n\nBut Cooper did give some details about his second love Kristin in a 1997 interview with the North Carolina News & Observer.\n\nKristin, née Bernhardt, was working as a staff attorney for the North Carolina General Assembly in the 1980s, making Cooper one of her de-facto bosses at the time.\n\nCooper told the newspaper they met while devising an update to a law about car salvage.\n\n'While many romances have been sparked in automobiles, few can claim, as the Coopers can, to have met in the Legislative Study Committee on Auto Salvage Titles,' News & Observer interviewer Rob Christensen wrote in the May 12, 1997 piece.\n\nAssembly records show that law was updated in the 1989 legislative session, meaning Cooper and his now-wife's romance likely started some time that year or earlier.\n\nThere was just one problem. Kristin was 10 years into her marriage to Army doctor Goerge Godette, with whom she was raising a five-year-old daughter.\n\nCourt records show the couple filed for divorce on August 21, 1989, during the legislative session when Kristin and Cooper reportedly began their romance.\n\nKristin and George did not finalize their split until May 1991. Cooper married her the following March.\n\nThe Godette's' decree of divorce, signed by the judge on May 1, 1991, said that 'a state of complete and irreconcilable incompatibility has arisen between the parties such that the legitimate aims of the marriage have been destroyed'.\n\nWhile fighting over alimony, Kristin's attorney sent a list of questions to the Army Lieutenant doctor, including: 'During your marriage, have you ever had sexual relations with another person?'\n\nHis attorney objected and wrote that the question was 'irrelevant and constitutionally privileged.'\n\nA joint filing by the former couple said they separated sometime between December 1987 and April 1988.\n\nThe dates suggest Kristin had split with her first husband when she got together with Cooper but was still legally married.\n\nThe court awarded Kristin primary custody of their daughter Hilary, with visitation rights for George of 14 days a year.\n\nNeither Cooper nor Kristin's ex-husband responded to requests for comment.\n\nCooper went on to serve as a state senator, 16 years as North Carolina Attorney General, and a term as governor from 2017 to 2025.\n\nCourt records show that in 2011, Hilary, then age 26, filed for adoption by Cooper, officially becoming his legal daughter.\n\nOn Monday, Cooper announced his candidacy for the US Senate. North Carolina is set to be a key battleground between Democrats and Republicans in 2026.\n\nThe apparent overlap between Kristin's first marriage to a veteran and her relationship with Cooper may prove controversial in The Tar Heel State, after 2020 Democratic nominee for the NC US Senate race Cal Cunningham was embroiled in a scandal over an extramarital texting affair.\n\nCunningham's steamy messages with the wife of an Army veteran, revealed by website National File in October 2020, led to an Army investigation into the would-be senator, who is a Lieutenant Colonel in the Reserves.\n\nThe father of two narrowly lost in the election the following month to Republican Thom Tillis, whose upcoming retirement has prompted Cooper's run for the seat.","summary":"Democrats have promoted Roy Cooper as a model of controversy-free leadership, but scrutiny of his past is raising new questions about his moral judgment.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14959537/democrat-roy-cooper-secret-wife-scandal-senate.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/04/20/100917103-0-image-m-2_1754336399604.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-04 20:41:00","author":"Editor,Josh Boswell","authors":["Editor","Josh Boswell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.132},{"id":348151120,"title":"Greg Gutfeld, Fox’s Late-Night King, Joins Fallon For Rare Crossover","text":"Greg Gutfeld, the host of Fox's \"Gutfeld!\", shown at Fox News Channel Studios in New York City. (Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nGreg Gutfeld’s appearance on NBC’s The Tonight Show later this week not only marks the Fox News Channel host’s first appearance on one of the major late-night TV talk shows.\n\nIt also comes at a time when the Fox host’s star is on the rise, given the new Fox Nation game show he hosts in addition to his regular nightly Fox talk show. And, more importantly, his upcoming Jimmy Fallon appearance on Thursday coincides with Gutfeld increasingly proving to be the exception to the late night talk show rule.\n\nWhile the economics and key metrics for traditional late-night talk TV remain in terminal decline — and with CBS’ The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and its veteran host set to disappear altogether next year — Fox’s motormouth funnyman is quite possibly the only late-night host without a reason to be looking over his shoulder at the moment. In fact, the latest Nielsen data points to Gutfeld continuing to dominate the late-night landscape, his Gutfeld! being the highest-rated in the genre (averaging a little over 3.1 million viewers and just shy of 400,000 in the key demo).\n\nSince the announcement of Colbert’s cancellation alone, Gutfeld’s ratings are up 11% in terms of total viewers and 4% in the demo.\n\nWhat makes Gutfeld’s ascent even more remarkable is how lean his operation is compared to the network shows he now outperforms. While CBS reportedly burned through a staggering $100 million annually to produce Colbert’s show — which included a staff of around 200 — Gutfeld! runs much leaner.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nFox’s Greg Gutfeld is winning the late-night ratings war\n\nI haven’t been able to nail down an official exact figure but have nevertheless heard that the budget for Gutfeld! doesn’t even approach double-digit millions, and that the show’s team numbers around 20 people. No wonder former late-night host Samantha Bee commented just days ago that CBS’ cancellation of Colbert was a “no-brainer,\" given the fact that the show was “definitely hemorrhaging money.”\n\nLikewise, it’s no surprise that Gutfeld couldn’t resist a bit of teasing during his Friday episode, when he alluded to Colbert’s recent interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris: “While Colbert interviews a loser, Jimmy Fallon invites … a winner.” Gutfeld’s audience applauded as he went on to plug his upcoming chat with Fallon. “It’s the biggest crossover since the Harlem Globetrotters visited the Golden Girls.” He continued: “Unlike the other guys, Jimmy sitting with me proves he’s not afraid of upsetting his peers or afraid of my mesmerizing charm.”\n\nJimmy Fallon, the host of NBC's \"The Tonight Show.\" (Photo by: Todd Owyoung/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)\nNBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images\n\nWhen Gutfeld! premiered back in April 2021, it brought a comedic and politics-infused vibe into competition with the celebrity-heavy format practiced by NBC, CBS, and ABC. The Gutfeld! formula essentially blended its host’s sharp monologues with irreverent panel chats — and that bet has clearly paid off for Fox. Since its launch, Gutfeld! has grown its total viewership 113% according to Nielsen data (and 46% in the coveted 25-54 demographic).\n\nBy August 2022, it had even dethroned Colbert as the top-rated late-night show, a lead it never surrendered.\n\nGutfeld’s upcoming sitdown with Fallon, meanwhile, is also notable for another reason: Fallon, whose show typically avoids overt political drama these days in favor of games and music, has rarely booked a conservative media personality of Gutfeld’s profile (at least in the Trump 2.0 era; Trump himself, of course, famously appeared as a happy-go-lucky guest before becoming president). It could be argued this is an attempt by NBC to make a play for a broader audience, bearing in mind that late-night guests tend to overwhelmingly lean to the left of the ideological divide. Or maybe it’s simply a ratings play, given Gutfeld’s dominance of late-night.\n\nWhatever the reason, the fact remains: This is a terrible time to be a late-night TV host, and to be a network working to support that host’s show. Everything from streaming to hyper-partisan politics are eating away at ad dollars and pulling audiences elsewhere. CBS cited financial reasons for pulling the plug on Colbert, despite strong viewership compared to his peers (as an aside: One can’t help wondering that if losing money really was the issue, it seems strange for CBS to prefer to continue bleeding money into 2026 rather than pulling the plug on Colbert immediately).\n\nIn this climate, Gutfeld stands as the outlier. He’s built a cable-based juggernaut that not only tops his direct competitors but often outdraws the combined viewership of the traditional late-night slate. Gutfeld can chuckle about his Fallon appearance being a “crossover,” but in terms of ratings momentum he’s the one who has the upper hand.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Greg Gutfeld’s upcoming Tonight Show appearance coincides with his rise as late-night’s ratings leader, at a time when the format is in decline.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/andymeek/2025/08/04/greg-gutfeld-foxs-late-night-king-joins-fallon-for-rare-crossover/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6891062df8ef48530cf4c8d2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-04 20:27:56","author":"Andy Meek,Senior Contributor,Todd Owyoung","authors":["Andy Meek","Senior Contributor","Todd Owyoung"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.251},{"id":348165856,"title":"¿Quién es el líder del Partido Demócrata?","text":"¿Quién es el líder del Partido Demócrata? | Fox Business Video\n\nto top close\n\nThis video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nOn Air Fox Noticias Clips\n\nAugust 04, 2025\n\n¿Quién es el líder del Partido Demócrata?\n\nKamala Harris regresa al centro de atención para promocionar su nuevo libro junto al próximamente cancelado Stephen Colbert, pero se queda en blanco cuando le preguntan quién lidera el Partido Demócrata.\n\nNOW - 7:00 PM\n\nFox Business Channel\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n6:00 PM - 7:00 PM\n\n7:00 PM - 8:00 PM\n\nKelsey Grammer's Historic Battles for America\n\n8:00 PM - 9:00 PM\n\nKelsey Grammer's Historic Battles for America\n\n9:00 PM - 9:30 PM\n\nFox News Channel\n\nSpecial Report with Bret Baier\n\n6:00 PM - 7:00 PM\n\nThe Ingraham Angle\n\n7:00 PM - 8:00 PM\n\nJesse Watters Primetime\n\n8:00 PM - 9:00 PM\n\n9:00 PM - 9:30 PM\n\nFox Weather Channel\n\nFox Weather\n\nLive Stream\n\nFox News Radio\n\nFOX News Radio Live Channel Coverage\n\nLive Stream\n\nFox News Channel Live\n\nWATCH LIVE: Fleeing Texas Dems respond after governor orders their arrest\n\nLive Stream","summary":"Kamala Harris regresa al centro de atención para promocionar su nuevo libro junto al próximamente cancelado Stephen Colbert, pero se queda en blanco cuando le preguntan quién lidera el Partido Demócrata.","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6376549802112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/b19aaebc-84a4-4b83-82c3-c4818ddca498/65084142-8c54-40e1-9757-bb651b4c5227/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-04 20:23:31","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":348151092,"title":"American Eagle Stock Jumps 23% After Trump Praises Controversial Sydney Sweeney Ad","text":"American Eagle stock skyrocketed Monday after President Donald Trump praised actress Sydney Sweeney for having the “HOTTEST ad out there” amid a firestorm of controversy over an advertisement critics have accused of promoting eugenics, which some conservatives have instead hailed as a rebuke of “wokeness.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump praised actress Sydney Sweeney's controversial American Eagle ad in a post on Monday. (Photo by Brendan SMIALOWSKI / AFP) (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nAmerican Eagle’s stock price was up nearly 23% as of 3 p.m. EDT on Monday, a steep increase that started hours earlier, after Trump made a post on Truth Social praising a divisive commercial starring Sweeney the company debuted last week.\n\nEarlier Monday, Trump praised Sweeney’s controversial marketing stint: “It’s for American Eagle, and the jeans are ‘flying off the shelves.’ Go get ‘em Sydney!”\n\nTrump hailed Sweeney’s apparent voter registration after multiple reports over the weekend indicated she is registered as a Republican voter in Florida.\n\nTrump compared Sweeney unfavorably to “Woke singer Taylor Swift,” whom he previously said he “hates” after the singer endorsed his election opponent Vice President Kamala Harris in October, calling her “NO LONGER HOT.”\n\nIn his post Monday, Trump cited the recent resignation of Jaguar CEO Adrian Mardell, who stepped down months after the British luxury vehicle company drew “woke” allegations for a colorful and diverse rebrand, though the company said his resignation was unrelated to the controversy and had been planned.\n\nTrump said Jaguar should have learned from Bud Light, referencing the conservative-led boycotts against the beer company after it sent transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney a customized beer can with her face on it in 2023.\n\n“The tide has seriously turned — Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump said.\n\nWhy Did Sweeney’s American Eagle Ad Spark Controversy?\n\nIn a marketing video for American Eagle, Sweeney dons a pair of the brand’s jeans and a denim jacket and makes a pun on the words “jeans” and “genes.” “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue,” Sweeney says, as the camera pans up to her face and reveals her blue eyes. The ad triggered backlash from critics on social media who felt the ad comes close to promoting eugenics, implying Sweeney’s blonde-haired, blue-eyed genes are more desirable than other traits. Shalini Shankar, a Northwestern University anthropology professor who studies youth and advertising, told CNN she believes American Eagle was “aligning themselves with a white nationalist, MAGA-friendly identity,” stating the company is “trying to rebrand themselves for the present moment, and language is very deliberately used here.”\n\nHow Have Sweeney And American Eagle Responded To The Controversy?\n\nSweeney has not yet publicly addressed the controversy over her American Eagle ad. The company posted a statement over the weekend defending its marketing campaign: “‘Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans’ is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We’ll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way. Great jeans look good on everyone.”\n\nWho Else Has Backed Sweeney Amid The American Eagle Controversy?\n\nA handful of high-profile Republicans have championed Sweeney’s ad as a rebuke to “woke” culture, including Vice President JD Vance, who backed the actress in an appearance on the conservative “Ruthless” podcast over the weekend. “My political advice to the Democrats is, continue to tell everybody who thinks Sydney Sweeney is attractive is a Nazi,” Vance said.

Here’s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: DJI)\n\nA leaked render of the DJI Mini 5 Pro seems to reveal the drone's design\nA separate image of the box may have also revealed its specs\nThe leaks hint at a 1-inch sensor and LiDAR-powered autofocus\n\nThe DJI Mini 5 Pro seems unlikely to hit its previously-rumored August 7 launch date, but fans of tiny drones have at least been given some solace in the form of two big leaks – and they hint at a little flying camera that could be worth waiting a little longer for.\n\nFirstly, a render of the rumored successor to one of the world's best drones was shared on the Discord channel for Drone-Hacks, giving us what could be our first look at the drone.\nIf the image is correct, the Mini 5 Pro will look very similar to its Mini 4 Pro predecessor, aside from a larger camera module and the inclusion of two forward-facing LiDAR sensors for improved obstacle avoidance.\n\nYou may like\n\nDJI isn't slowing down: the DJI Mini 5 Pro, DJI Avata 3, and DJI Neo 2 all get mentioned in new leaks\n\nDJI’s new Mavic 4 Pro is an incredible camera drone, but there’s bad news for US customers\n\nDJI promises the Mavic 4 Pro will 'spin your world', and sets a launch date\n\nThat LiDAR-powered feature has previously appeared on the DJI Mavic 4 Pro and DJI Air 3S, but this would be the first time we've seen it on a Mini series drone – and it could be particularly useful if you fly in low light.\n\nMini 5 Pro leaked render! The leak didn’t come from our team, some beta tester shared a picture on the public Discord. Thanks for the credit tho! #Mini5Pro https://t.co/LV1eQJCYKDAugust 3, 2025\n\nEven more revealing is the potential list of specs, shared by @JasperEllens and DroneXL. According to some leaked packaging, the DJI Mini 5 Pro will have a 1-inch image sensor – up from the 1/1.3-inch chip on the Mini 4 Pro – and be capable of shooting 4K/120fps footage, another slight boost from its predecessor's 4K/100fps mode.\nElsewhere, there's the promise of a \"high quality 48mm med-tele mode\", which will presumably be similar to the one that recently arrived on the DJI Pocket 3, thanks to a firmware update. This is effectively a 'lossless' crop mode that can be handy if you need a bit more reach.\nThe leak also promises a 36-minute flight time, which would be a slight boost on the claimed 34 minutes managed by the Mini 4 Pro (or 45 minutes, if you shell out for the Intelligent Flight Battery Plus, which isn't available in the EU).\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nThe big question\n\n(Image credit: DJI)\nWhile those Mini 5 Pro specs sound very promising indeed – and could make me consider upgrading my Mini 3 Pro drone – there is one slightly worrying omission from the box and specs sheet.\nUsually, there's a \"less than 249g\" tag accompanying the \"ultra-light and foldable\" description on a Mini series box. That isn't there this time, at least not on the leaked packaging.\nDoes this mean the Mini 5 Pro could be the first in the series to exceed that crucial weight? In many regions, including the US and UK, a sub-250g weight is a selling point because flying regulations are more relaxed. For example, in the Open A1 category in the UK, you can fly over strangers (but not crowds) without needing any extra permission.\nThere is a chance that the Mini 5 Pro's new tech (bigger camera, LiDAR sensors, perhaps new motors) have pushed it over the weight limit, but I'd be surprised if that was the case.\nThe whole selling point of the Mini series has been that they offer advanced camera tech in a bundle that's barely bigger than a camera lens, and also ducks under that crucial weight barrier. I love my DJI Mini 3 Pro for all of those reasons, so a new model that doesn't tick all of the same boxes wouldn't have the same appeal.\nUnfortunately, it appears the Mini 5 Pro has been postponed from its previously rumored launch date, so we may have to wait a while longer to see it – and to find out if it'll actually go on sale in the US.\nYou might also like\n\nDJI Mini 5 Pro leaks give us our first glimpse of the beginner drone and a potential release date – here’s what we know\nI tested DJI’s impressive first 360 camera, but Insta360 still has the edge\nDJI’s first robot vacuum gets launch date in official teaser – and it looks like the Romo is arriving sooner than expected\n\nSee more News about Cameras\n\nMark Wilson\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nSenior news editor\n\nMark is TechRadar's Senior news editor.

Two-thirds of members within the 150-member chamber must be present to pass legislation.In a letter, Abbott referred to the fleeing members as \"derelict Democrats\" and threatened to remove them from the Legislature altogether if they didn't return by 3 p.m. Monday, August 4.\"Real Texans do not run from a fight. But that's exactly what most of the Texas House Democrats just did...rather than doing their job and voting on urgent legislation affecting the lives of all Texans, they have fled Texas to deprive the House of the quorum necessary to meet and conduct business,\" he wrote in part.Republicans have a slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives and a slightly larger one in the U.S. Senate. Democrats hope to take back the House in next year's midterms, which traditionally have seen the party that is not in power in the White House gain a number of seats.During President Donald Trump's first term, Democrats picked up 41 seats in the midterms. Trump, meanwhile, has backed Abbott's move to redraw the state map.What To KnowThe Chronicle's editorial board published an op-ed piece on Monday, comparing Abbott's efforts during the recent deadly Texas floods to his political efforts to swiftly redraw and enact new districts across the Lone Star State.\"The governor has followed his orders from Washington and put a Republican power grab before communities devastated by Central Texas floods,\" the editorial reads. \"With a stroke of his pen, Abbott could have moved hundreds of millions of dollars by executive fiat. He could have called a session with the sole objective of addressing the still-unfolding crisis in the Hill Country.\"The editorial board continued: \"But the lives of Texans come second to the desires of President Trump and his loyalists. When Trump utters the words 'very simple redrawing,' Abbott asks, how many seats do you want? And we end up with a Congressional map that puts Democrats on the endangered species list.\"Democrats have argued that if Republicans succeed in redrawing districts in Texas, Trump will push other states to do the same.The editorial also notes that both political parties, be it Republicans in Texas or Democrats in Illinois, have engaged in gerrymandering while in power to boost future prospects.The difference now, according to the Chronicle, is that Texas' bluest cities are being carved up and would hypothetically lead to a Republican majority on par with the nation's reddest state, Wyoming. Texas Democrats would safely hold about 21 percent of the state's congressional districts even though 46 percent of voters in last year's presidential election voted for Democratic nominee then-Vice President Kamala Harris.Abbott is also chastised for his threats of removal, with the editorial calling such an outcome \"an attack on democracy itself.\"\"None of this was necessary,\" the editorial concludes. \"Abbott could've just made the special session all about flooding. Heck, lawmakers probably could've gotten a recovery package passed with plenty of time left over to sift through Lieutenant. Governor Dan Patrick's buffet of red-meat priorities. Instead, the well-being of Texans has once again come second to flagrant backroom partisan power-plays.\"What People Are SayingSergio Sanchez, a former Republican chairman and longtime radio host in Texas, told Newsweek: \"This Texas GOP strategy is based on political reality. Almost the entire southern Texas border has shifted red. Red represents the traditional values, work ethic, economic opportunities, immigration controls and police protections no longer espoused by modern Democrats.\"He added: \"The Democrats are again showing they have no values and solutions for Texas and the nation. Their cowardly response is laughable and sad. Democrats are clueless and lost.\"Former Democratic Texas Representative Colin Allred, also a past U.S. Senate candidate against Senator Ted Cruz, in a statement on Sunday: \"This fight isn't just about maps—it's about power. When Republicans silence Black and Latino voters, they're not just rigging elections. They're rigging who gets health care, clean water, and a fair shot.\"Let's be clear: they don't just want to rig the vote. They want to use that power to rig the economy — to keep helping the wealthy and well-connected while working families get left behind.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on X on Sunday: \"I support the immediate arrest of these rogue lawmakers who've fled their duties. These radical Democrats are spitting in the face of every Texan they swore to represent. This is cowardice and dereliction of duty, and they should face the full force of the law without apology.\"Texas state Representative Gene Wu, the Texas House Democratic Caucus leader, said during a press conference in Chicago: \"We will do whatever it takes. What that looks like, we don't know.\"What Happens Next?Republican State House Speaker Dustin Burrows said the chamber would still meet as planned at 3 p.m. on Monday.\"If a quorum is not present then, to borrow the recent talking points from some of my Democrat colleagues, all options will be on the table....\" he wrote on X.The lack of a quorum would also delay votes on flood relief and new warning systems in the wake of last month's catastrophic floods in Texas.","summary":"\"The lives of Texans come second to the desires of President Trump and his loyalists,\" the Houston Chronicle's editorial board wrote Monday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/greg-abbott-texas-redistricting-gerrymandering-floods-2108753","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2696260/abbott.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=85db2de721ffa22745c8c2fad34976c6","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-04 19:27:40","author":"Nick Mordowanec","authors":["Nick Mordowanec"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.124},{"id":348138240,"title":"A Chinese GPU vendor you've never heard of wants to challenge Nvidia and AMD in the pro market with 24GB VRAM - surely it cannot succeed?","text":"Skip to main content\n\nTech Radar Pro\n\nTech Radar Gaming\n\nTech Radar Pro\n\nTechRadar the business technology experts\n\nSearch TechRadar\n\nView Profile\n\nBelgië (Nederlands)\n\nDeutschland\n\nNorth America\n\nUS (English)\n\nAustralasia\n\nNew Zealand\n\nExpert Insights\n\nWebsite builders\n\nWeb hosting\n\nBest web hosting\nBest office chairs\nBest website builder\nBest antivirus\nExpert Insights\n\nRecommended reading\n\nIntel just greenlit a monstrous dual-GPU video card with 48GB of RAM just for AI - and here it is\n\nAnother dual Intel GPU card with 48GB VRAM launched as Arc Pro emerges as cheap Nvidia and AMD alternative for AI crowd\n\nIntel could be releasing a video card with TWO GPU chips and 48GB of memory; could it be a sleeper hit for AI training?\n\nReport claims Nvidia will sell a special version of its most powerful GPU to China to comply with US export restrictions, but that won't be enough\n\nChinese vendor launches first workstation PC with Intel's fastest CPU and up to two Arc Pro B60 GPUs, possibly with 48GB of RAM each\n\nHere are all the Radeon AI Pro R9700 cards that have been announced: MSI, XFX, Biostar and Acer are still missing\n\nAMD is surpassing Nvidia in one particular market, and I don't understand why — 11th eGPU based on AMD Radeon RX 7000 series debuts and even has Thunderbolt 5\n\nA Chinese GPU vendor you've never heard of wants to challenge Nvidia and AMD in the pro market with 24GB VRAM - surely it cannot succeed?\n\nEfosa Udinmwen \n\n4 August 2025\n\nNew Chinese GPU contender has pro-market ambitions\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

The company has not finalized the GPU’s clock speeds, memory frequencies, or power consumption yet.\nEarly renders show one design using an 8-pin PCIe power connector, while another opts for a 16-pin version, hinting at variance in power targets.\nWithout this data, performance estimates remain speculative despite synthetic benchmarks like 3DMark Fire Strike and Geekbench OpenCL showing decent scores.\nThis attempt is ambitious, but without clear pricing, driver maturity, or proven reliability, it remains to be seen whether Lisuan Tech can translate its technical claims into real-world traction.\nLisuan is not the first Chinese challenger to attempt to take on AMD and Nvidia - Zhaoxin struggled to scale beyond basic GPU functions, Jingjia Micro's JM9 series never gained traction, and Innosilicon’s Fantasy lineup failed to attract real-world users despite promising specs.\nVia TechPowerUp\nYou might also like\n\nEndgame Gear warns mouse config tool has been infected with malware\nCheck out the best 3D modeling software for 3D printing and more\nWe've rounded up the best portable monitors available now\n\nEfosa Udinmwen\n\nFreelance Journalist\n\nEfosa has been writing about technology for over 7 years, initially driven by curiosity but now fueled by a strong passion for the field.

Both sides settled at $16million.\n\nDespite the lawsuit, the longtime news program had continued to call out the controversial politician, as host Scott Pelley slammed the 79-year-old for his efforts to target some of the biggest law firms in the country that have been critical of him with executive orders.\"Gayle doesn’t want her legacy tied to these ratings or this mess,” another at the time added. \"She’s weighing her next move carefully, but don’t expect her to stay loyal to a network that can’t even get a morning show off the ground anymore.\"\n\nThe insider claimed the dysfunctional network has \"no direction, no momentum, and no buzz.

Su posible presencia tuvo mucha influencia.\n\nSin embargo, Harris descartó cualquier posibilidad de postularse para reemplazar al gobernador Gavin Newsom la semana pasada.\n\nEn el proceso, prácticamente impulsó a todos los demás candidatos a tomar impulso y consolidarse como líderes de la contienda.\n\nYa hay muchos candidatos que se han postulado a la gobernación. El campo incluye una amplia gama de contendientes, en términos de trayectorias y experiencias, especialmente entre los demócratas.\n\nPero sin Harris, en esta etapa de la campaña, no hay un claro favorito, según expertos políticos.\n\n“Esta es la contienda por la gobernación más abierta que California ha visto en la historia moderna”, declaró Dan Schnur, profesor de comunicación política en la USC y la UC Berkeley. “No hay precedentes en la era digital, ni siquiera desde la invención de la televisión por cable, de que haya habido tal falta de un claro favorito”.\n\nAun así, la decisión de Harris de mantenerse al margen de la contienda ha dado un impulso a algunos candidatos.\n\nLa campaña de la exrepresentante Katie Porter afirmó haber recaudado más de 250.000 dólares en las 36 horas posteriores al anuncio de Harris. La campaña de la demócrata del condado de Orange ha enviado numerosos correos electrónicos de recaudación de fondos en los últimos días, vinculando el historial de Porter con el de Harris y compartiendo encuestas de marzo que la muestran liderando la contienda demócrata sin la exvicepresidenta en consideración.\n\nY está Xavier Becerra, quien, sin Harris, puede presumir de tener la mayor experiencia en el poder ejecutivo en este campo. Becerra, con un amplio historial en la política californiana, fue secretario de Salud de Estados Unidos durante la administración Biden.\n\nAun así, otros candidatos tienen más experiencia en ser elegidos para cargos estatales: la vicegobernadora Eleni Kounalakis (quien recibió elogios recientes de la expresidenta de la Cámara de Representantes Nancy Pelosi), el superintendente estatal de Instrucción Pública Tony Thurmond y la excontralora Betty Yee.\n\nPero en esta etapa, ningún candidato puede decir que la carrera está perdida, según los expertos.\n\nY eso significa que existe la oportunidad de que los votantes vean una verdadera competencia en la carrera por la gobernación, particularmente entre los demócratas, dijo Matt Lesenyie, experto en política californiana que imparte clases en Cal State Long Beach.\n\nMientras tanto, hay algunas líneas argumentales que los políticos están considerando a medida que se desarrolla la contienda.\n\nVía para los republicanos\n\nDesde 2012, los dos candidatos más votados en las primarias de California para ciertos cargos estatales y federales, incluyendo la gobernación, han avanzado a las elecciones generales, independientemente de los partidos políticos.\n\nAun así, los votantes californianos siempre han elegido a un demócrata y a un republicano para pasar a las elecciones generales para gobernador. “En la era de las primarias abiertas, los republicanos han tenido mucha suerte de conseguir un candidato entre los dos primeros en la primavera, y luego han tenido mucha suerte de perder en el otoño”, dijo Schnur, y añadió: “Es poco probable que veamos un cambio en alguna de estas tendencias”.\n\nLos demócratas sin duda deberán tener esto en cuenta a medida que se intensifica la contienda entre sus candidatos, afirmó Sarah Hill, profesora de ciencias políticas en Cal State Fullerton.\n\n“Lo que los demócratas pueden hacer es dividir tanto sus votos que, si los republicanos solo tienen un par de candidatos serios, podrían fácilmente obtener más votos y colarse en las elecciones generales”, declaró Hill. “El partido tendrá que prestar atención e indicar rápidamente a los votantes en quiénes deben centrarse”.\n\nHasta ahora, los republicanos tienen al sheriff del condado de Riverside, Chad Bianco, y al ex presentador de Fox News, Steve Hilton, compitiendo por la contienda.\n\nLa campaña de Bianco esta semana se jactó de una sólida recaudación de fondos, mientras que la de Hilton se jactó de sus viajes a varios condados de California.\n\nAmbos celebraron la noticia de Harris de que se mantendría al margen de la contienda, pero lo hicieron criticando su liderazgo previo en varios cargos electos en California.\n\nPróximos pasos de Porter\n\nAunque dudan en calificarla de clara favorita, varios expertos afirman que Porter sin duda se ha posicionado a la cabeza de una concurrida contienda.\n\n“Si Katie Porter llega a ser gobernadora, será por lo que haga en el futuro, no por lo que haya hecho hasta ahora”, declaró Schnur.\n\nUna figura progresista predilecta, conocida por enfrentarse a las grandes corporaciones durante su mandato en el Congreso, Porter abrazó a la facción “Bernie Sanders” del partido durante su reciente y fallida candidatura al Senado de los Estados Unidos, señaló Schnur.\n\n“Ya se ha consolidado como una voz progresista muy fuerte contra Trump. La pregunta es si podrá desarrollar o articular un mensaje más amplio en esta campaña que el del año pasado”, dijo Schnur.\n\n“Eso no significa que deba moderarse, sino que necesita encontrar la manera de atraer a votantes más moderados”, añadió.\n\nPorter ha consolidado una marca única, afirmó Lesenyie, de la Universidad Estatal de California en Long Beach. Añadió que debería mantener una identidad similar —una madre trabajadora que entiende el precio de los comestibles— en lugar de cambiar por completo si quiere tener éxito en esta ocasión.\n\n“Yo no renunciaría a eso”, dijo. “Sería como decirle a McDonald’s que cambie la receta”.\n\nUna cantera diversa\n\nAlgo más sobre el panorama de candidatos a gobernador, más allá de la falta de un claro favorito, llamó la atención de Hill: la falta de hombres blancos en la contienda.\n\n“Casi todas son mujeres y/o personas de color”, señaló Hill. “¿Por fin vamos a tener algo diferente?”\n\n¿Ha llegado el momento, dijo, de que California elija a su primera gobernadora?\n\n“Es realmente interesante si se observa la diversa cantera que el Partido Demócrata ha estado construyendo durante los últimos 15 años”, dijo.\n\nPero la diversidad en el panorama podría complicar a algunos candidatos, dijo Schnur, señalando específicamente a Becerra y al exalcalde de Los Ángeles, Antonio Villaraigosa.\n\n“Villaraigosa y Becerra son candidatos mucho más complejos que su identidad por sí sola”, dijo Schnur, “pero sin duda, dos latinos prominentes en la contienda les dificultan las cosas a ambos”.\n\nCualquiera de los dos tiene la capacidad de ascender a la cabeza de la contienda por la gobernación, dijo Schnur, “pero será mucho más difícil para ellos mientras el otro esté en la contienda”.\n\n“Efecto Schwarzenegger”\n\nEn 2003, los votantes de California destituyeron al gobernador demócrata Gray Davis, reemplazándolo por un republicano con muy poca experiencia política, pero un nombre muy conocido: la estrella de cine Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nLa campaña duró solo 11 semanas.\n\nLa actual contienda por la gobernación es propicia para otra situación similar: “el efecto Schwarzenegger”, dijo Lesenyie.\n\n“Si yo fuera cualquiera de esos candidatos, me preocuparía que una celebridad, como George Clooney, se sumara, sin experiencia, pero con un nombre reconocido al instante y capaz de autofinanciar su campaña”.\n\nLa incertidumbre que rodea la contienda por la gobernación de California es emocionante, al menos para algunos.\n\n“Como politólogos, es divertido”, dijo Hill. “Esto es lo que nos gusta ver”.\n\nOriginal Story","summary":"¿Es ahora Katie Porter la que tiene que perder la contienda? ¿Hay una nueva vía para un fuerte contendiente republicano?

The storied Los Angeles Times, the state’s biggest paper and once one of the most influential regional outlets in the US, lost more than 20% of its newsroom last January, months after laying off 74 staffers amid advertising declines in 2023. On top of losing tens of millions of dollars a year, it also suffered controversy and subscription losses after its owner blocked an endorsement of Kamala Harris in last year’s election.\n\nOne of Rupert Murdoch’s flagship papers, the New York Post, meanwhile, has remained profitable, and already has a large and established readership in California. The Los Angeles area is home to the second-largest concentration of Post readers, according to News Corp, and the vast majority (90%) of the Post’s digital readership lives outside of New York.\n\nIt comes at a critical time for a US state very much on the dual frontlines of the climate crisis, with extreme weather driving ever more common and increasingly devastating wildfires and a huge rebuilding effort needed after January’s fires in the Los Angeles area, and the Trump administration’s aggressive anti-immigrant agenda.\n\nThe launch of the California Post has also been timed to coincide with a high-profile period for the Bay Area and LA with elections due to be held in 2026, including for California governor, and the state set to host matches during next year’s Fifa World Cup, and LA to host the Summer Olympics in 2028.\n\n“Los Angeles and California surely need a daily dose of The Post as an antidote to the jaundiced, jaded journalism that has sadly proliferated,” said Robert Thomson, News Corp CEO. “We are at a pivotal moment for the city and the state, and there is no doubt that The Post will play a crucial role in engaging and enlightening readers, who are starved of serious reporting and puckish wit.”","summary":"Murdoch family’s News Corp will bring a version of the NYC paper to LA with daily newspaper called the California Post\n\nNews Corp, part of the Murdoch family media empire, has announced it will bring a version of the brash rightwing New York City tabloid the New York Post to California in early 2026 with the launch of a daily Los Angeles-based newspaper called the California Post.\n\nAccording to New York Post Media Group – a News Corp subsidiary and home of New York’s biggest tabloid, as well as Page Six, and Decider – the California Post will look and feel similar to its New York counterpart, delivering reporting, sports coverage and celebrity gossip from a California perspective.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/aug/04/new-york-post-california-murdoch","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f3d0a436f0f96e541ad78ec14a76f2514c313a3/942_0_6567_5255/master/6567.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-04 18:43:53","author":"Lucy Campbell","authors":["Lucy Campbell"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.147},{"id":348125840,"title":"Astros vs. Marlins odds, predictions: MLB picks, best bets for Monday","text":"The new Yankees relievers fixed a hole like congestion pricing fixed the leaks in the subways. \n\nIf this keeps up, Brian Cashman will be as popular as MTA boss Janno Lieber. \n\nPresident Trump wants the NFL’s Commanders to change their name back to the Redskins. \n\nThere are no plans for that to happen or for the SHL’s Macon Mayhem to be called the Macon Whoopee again.\n\nA couple of Taylor Swift fans from Missouri named their newborn Kelce Taylor. \n\nFatboy Slim can’t believe how irresponsible the parents are. \n\nAnd Kamala Harris visited Stephen Colbert for the eighth time. \n\nWith the Over/Under set at 9.5 runs, over bettors need two more laughfests before Colbert exits … Cue the Seinfeld music.\n\nJason Alexander throws for Houston.

'And this is the action of a petulant child. Like, you give me bad news, I fire the messenger.'\n\nOther Republicans and Trump allies are not happy that the president's ire was taken out on McEntarfer.\n\nRepublican Sen. Cyndia Lummis of Wyoming said if the numbers are accurate and she was still fired: 'That's a problem.'\n\n'These are turbulent times and we've created some of the turbulence, and so it should be expected that there would be some ups-and-downs associated with job market,' Lummis admitted to reporters on Capitol Hill.\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said Trump and those who decided to fire McEntarfer 'ought to grow up.'\n\nTrump-appointed BLS Commissioner William Beach said it's not the fault of the commissioner if jobs are initially reported incorrectly, and on X he called her firing 'groundless.' \n\nPresident Donald Trump needs someone to blame for a lackluster July jobs report, former NJ Gov. Chris Christie claims\n\nChristie said Trump is a 'petulant child' because 'when he gets news he doesn't like, he needs someone to blame because he won't take the responsibility himself'\n\nTrump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer (pictured) on Friday after the July jobs report showed more than 25 percent lower-than-expected jobs growth\n\n'The commissioner doesn't do anything to collect the numbers. The commissioner doesn't see the numbers until Wednesday before they're published,' Beach told CNN on Sunday. 'By the time the commissioner sees the numbers, they're all prepared.' \n\nIn a post on Sunday, Trump accused McEntarfer of intentionally over-reporting job growth before the 2024 presidential election. He claimed that McEntarfer overstated job growth by 818,000 for the year ending March 2024 and by 112,000 in August and September of last year.\n\nThe president insists the more positive reporting was done intentionally to boost Vice President Kamala Harris' chances of winning in the 2024 election.\n\nTrump lashes out by FIRING Biden-appointed senior official after disappointing jobs numbers report\n\nIt's standard procedure for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to issue revisions due to lags and complexities of gathering job numbers reports from more than 600,000 businesses. The adjustments are made to reflect more accurate figures once they are available.\n\nFormer officials, including Beach, have stated revisions are routine and not an inherent indication of manipulation.\n\n'These were records — No one can be that wrong?' Trump posted to Truth Social on Friday. 'We need accurate jobs numbers.'\n\n'She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes,' he continued.\n\nBut Beach warned that Trump has 'undermined credibility' and that no one he appoints to lead BLS will be trusted.\n\n'Suppose that they get a new commissioner and this person, male or female, are just the best people possible. And they do a bad number. Well, everybody's going to think, well, it's not as bad as it probably really is because they're going to suspect political influence,' Beach explained.\n\nChris Christie blasts 'petulant child' Trump over firings\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:54\n\nVideo Quality\n\n---WhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan---OpaqueSemi-Opaque\n\n---WhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan---OpaqueSemi-TransparentTransparent\n\n---WhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan---OpaqueSemi-TransparentTransparent\n\n50%75%100%125%150%175%200%300%400%\n\nNoneRaisedDepressedUniformDropshadow\n\nDefaultMonospace SerifProportional SerifMonospace Sans-SerifProportional Sans-SerifCasualScriptSmall Caps\n\nU.S. hiring growth dropped dramatically last month and unemployment ticked up, the latest jobs report released on Friday showed.\n\nNon-farm payrolls added 73,000 in July, more than 25 percent lower than the 100,000 expected by analysts. The unemployment rate also ticked up to 4.2 percent.\n\nThe report also sharply revised down the figures for May and June by a combined 258,000 jobs from the previously released figures.\n\nFollowing the revision June's total was left at just 14,000 and May's at 19,000 — effectively flat. Analysts say July's figure is also likely to be revised lower, possibly into negative territory.\n\nIt's not uncommon for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to adjust their reports after more accurate figures are collected\n\nThe latest figures suggest cracks are in fact starting to show up in the economy, despite a slew of previous better-than-expected economic data released recently.\n\nIt comes after the Federal Reserve once again held rates steady at its July meeting on Wednesday.\n\nThe weaker figures could incentivize the Fed to lower interest rates at its next meeting in September, something Trump has been pleading for during most of his second term.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has consistently declined to heed Trump's calls as he continues to monitor possible inflation from tariffs. \n\nThe unspoken truth about Trump's inner circle and Melania's unparalleled control\n\n'Higher tariffs have begun to show through more clearly to prices of some goods, but their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remain to be seen,' Powell told reporters, noting that inflation could be short-lived or more persistent.\n\nAccording to her LinkedIn bio, McEntarfer previously served as an economist at the Census Bureau and at the Treasury Department, as well as working as a senior economist at the Council of Economic Advisors for a year during the Biden administration.\n\nHer bio statement is a dry statement filled with economics lingo. 'My research is focused on labor market dynamics and interactions between firms and workers in the economy and has been published in the Journal of Labor Economics, American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, and the Journal of Economic Perspectives,' she writes.\n\n'I have spent over 20 years as a professional economist working on issues related to economic measurement and innovations in workforce data,' she states.\n\nRepublicansDonald TrumpPoliticsCNN\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nTrump knifed by fellow Republicans over recent firing as he plans revenge on 'rigged' jobs data\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Donald Trump's Republican allies and foes say the president was wrong to fire Labor Statistics commissioner over a lackluster July jobs report.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14969367/trump-republicans-fire-labor-statistics-bls-rigged.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/04/17/100913687-0-image-m-25_1754325628699.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/08/04/7501409947858810277/1024x576_MP4_7501409947858810277.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-04 18:30:32","author":"Editor,Katelyn Caralle","authors":["Editor","Katelyn Caralle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.409},{"id":348128052,"title":"Apple just made this classic Apple Watch obsolete, but it might not be the one you think","text":"Skip to main content\n\nTechRadar the technology experts\n\nSearch TechRadar\n\nView Profile\n\nBelgië (Nederlands)\n\nDeutschland\n\nNorth America\n\nUS (English)\n\nAustralasia\n\nNew Zealand\n\nTech Radar Pro\n\nTech Radar Gaming\n\nBack to school\nBest laptop\n\nNintendo Switch 2\nNYT Wordle today\nBest web hosting\n\nRecommended reading\n\nApple declares the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 ‘vintage’, limiting your repair options\n\nSmartwatches\nThe Samsung Galaxy Watch series' biggest flaw is something Apple nailed years ago\n\nSmartwatches\nSurprised to learn your older Apple Watch can run watchOS 26?

Here’s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: Luke Chesser / Unsplash)\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 1 is now officially obsolete, says Apple\nThat makes it harder to get official parts and repair service\nDespite the name, it’s not the same device as the original Apple Watch\n\nAre you still rocking an Apple Watch Series 1? If so, we’ve got some bad news: Apple has just declared it to be “obsolete,” making it much trickier to get proper service for your smartwatch. But the situation is actually slightly confusing, and there’s another model that is often confused for the Series 1.\n\nWe’ll get to that in a minute. But first, it’s worth understanding what Apple’s declaration means. Apple classifies its own products as “vintage” when the company stopped selling them more than five but fewer than seven years ago. Those products then graduate to becoming “obsolete” at some point after the seven-year mark. The Apple Watch Series 1 was discontinued seven years ago in 2018.\nHaving a vintage product isn’t so bad: it means that you should still be able to get it serviced with official parts from Apple, but only if those parts are actually available. Once it’s obsolete, though, Apple will no longer service it, and it’ll also stop making official parts available to third-party repair shops. That limits your options for getting the device fixed up, and that’s just what’s happened to the Apple Watch Series 1.\n\nYou may like\n\nApple declares the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 ‘vintage’, limiting your repair options\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Watch series' biggest flaw is something Apple nailed years ago\n\nSurprised to learn your older Apple Watch can run watchOS 26? You might still be missing out on some great new features\n\nWhat’s in a name?\n\n(Image credit: Future)\nDespite what you might think, the Apple Watch Series 1 isn’t the same as the original Apple Watch – confusingly, it’s actually a second-generation model. Apple released the first Apple Watch in 2015 (after teasing it in 2014), then launched the Series 1 and Series 2 (as part of the same generation) in 2016. The Series 1 was essentially a rebadged version of the original Apple Watch with a slightly modified chip inside. The Series 2, meanwhile, was a more significant upgrade.\n\nInterestingly, Apple declared the Series 2 to be obsolete in 2024 – before the Series 1, despite both hailing from the same generation. Apple stopped selling the Series 2 in 2017 – a year before the Series 1 – which might explain the discrepancy. Alternatively, Apple might simply have run out of parts for the Series 2 before those for the Series 1.\nEither way, the reality is it’ll now be that much harder to repair an Apple Watch Series 1. You can try your luck at third-party repair shops, but you’ll be relying on unofficial components rather than the real deal. If you’ve been thinking about upgrading, now is the time to start weighing up your options. With the Apple Watch Series 11 just around the corner, there’s plenty to consider.\nYou might also like\n\nApple Watch Series 11: Everything we know so far\nThe best Apple Watch 2025: Top smartwatches to use with iOS\nThe best smartwatch 2025: Top wearable tech and fitness trackers\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nSee more News about Smartwatches\n\nApple Watch\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nFreelance Contributor\n\nAlex Blake has been fooling around with computers since the early 1990s, and since that time he's learned a thing or two about tech.

This is according to cybersecurity researchers from Cloudflare, who have been observing such campaigns in the wild for at least two months.\n\nProofpoint’s link‑wrapping service, known as URL Defense, protects users by rewriting every inbound email link to route through Proofpoint’s inspection gateway before it reaches the actual recipient. When a person clicks a link in an email, it is evaluated in real-time (including sandbox detonation and reputation checks) and is only granted access if the link is deemed safe.\nBut here’s the catch: all original URLs are embedded within the encoded rewritten link (usually prefixed with “urldefense.proofpoint.com) which, as a side-effect, creates a sense of security with the recipients, making it more likely they will actually click it.\n\nYou may like\n\nThis Microsoft 365 phishing campaign can bypass MFA - here's what we know\n\nCybercriminals have found a sneaky way of stealing tax accounts and even encrypted messages: here's what you need to know\n\nGoogle Apps Script abused to launch dangerous phishing attacks\n\nActive campaign\nCybercriminals were seen creating brand new landing pages that mimic the Microsoft 365 login screen, and as such, are not yet flagged by security products. They would then shorten the URLs to those pages using popular URL shorteners such as Bitly. The next step is to break into email accounts already protected by Proofpoint, and use them to wrap the shortened URL.\n\nThe final step is to distribute the shortened and wrapped URL, often through the very same email accounts that were compromised earlier.\nCloudflare says it’s seen multiple attacks already, with crooks sending fake voice mail notification emails, and fake shared Microsoft Teams documents. Victims who don’t spot the attack go through a chain of redirects, landing at a page where they’re asked for their Microsoft 365 login credentials.\nAs a rule of thumb, links in emails should be carefully reviewed before being clicked, especially if the emails carry any sense of urgency with them.\n\nAre you a pro?

Their performance mirrored the fading relevance of an establishment that now clings to a dim remnant of its former glory.\n\nThis palpable decline, highlighted by recent events, is the culmination of years of eroding public trust. For decades, a pattern of fabrications and falsehoods has systematically gutted the elite’s credibility and sealed their downfall. While countless examples could be cited, four specific narratives stand out for their profound effect in hastening the old guard’s demise.\n\n1. Weapons of mass destruction in Iraq\n\nThe 2003 Iraq War was sold as a preemptive strike to protect the United States from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein’s alleged weapons of mass destruction. Bush administration officials, who later became the base of the Never Trump movement, and establishment media figures pushed this lie onto a public still reeling from 9/11.\n\nThen-Vice President Dick Cheney claimed in August 2002 that “there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction.” That same month, national security adviser Condoleezza Rice warned on CNN, “We don’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.” New York Times writer Judith Miller reported, citing anonymous officials, that Iraq was acquiring aluminum tubes for uranium enrichment, a key step toward nuclear weapons.\n\nThen, in February 2003, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell, the highly respected Operation Desert Storm hero, told the U.N. Security Council that Iraq had active chemical and biological weapons programs, that it was pursuing nuclear weapons, and that Iraq had ties to al Qaeda.\n\nYet United Nations inspectors, led by Hans Blix, found no WMDs in 2002 or 2003, and the Iraq Survey Group’s 2004 report confirmed Iraq’s WMD programs ended in 1991. Bush and his allies attempted to shift the war’s rationale away from preemptive self-defense and toward “spreading democracy,” but all moral authority was lost with the WMD lie.\n\nYears later, then-candidate Trump used this lie to pry the GOP away from the establishment’s grip.\n\n“The war was a big, fat mistake,” he said on the debate stage in South Carolina. “We spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives. We should have never been in Iraq. They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction, and there were none, and they knew there were none.”\n\n2. Russia collusion\n\nThe lie that Russia colluded with the Trump campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential election dominated the national news cycle for the first three years of Trump’s presidency. And despite the Mueller report’s conclusion that it “did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government,” and the subsequent Durham report’s scathing critique of the FBI’s initiation of the investigation, the establishment clung to the false narrative, using it to undermine the administration’s legitimacy and disrupt its ability to govern.\n\nToday, we are finally beginning to uncover the shady machinations that allowed this hoax to spread. In recent weeks, newly released documents by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard detailed the Obama administration’s attempts to manipulate and manufacture evidence to take down the newly elected Trump.\n\nRegardless of whether any officials are brought to justice — CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Sunday that former CIA Director John Brennan, former FBI Director James Comey, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton could face indictments due to their involvement — the Russia collusion hoax severely diminished public confidence in the establishment, especially the media. Gallup’s latest poll shows trust in mass media plummeting among Republicans and independents around the time the Mueller report was released, dragging down overall trust in media numbers to record lows.\n\n3. COVID-19 falsehoods\n\nEstablishment politicians and journalists reached new levels of dishonesty during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Anthony Fauci, who became the de facto leader of the establishment during this era, engineered a manipulation campaign against the public as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nHis misdeeds included telling “noble lies,” such as in March 2020 when he assured people that masking was useless before reversing course a month later. The reason for the shift? At the time, Fauci said it was because of evolving science. But a year later, he admitted to advising against masking because of a mask shortage among healthcare workers.\n\nHe similarly fibbed about the percentage of the population that would need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. “When polls said only about half of all Americans would take a vaccine, I was saying herd immunity would take 70% to 75%,” he said. “Then, when newer surveys said 60% or more would take it, I thought, ‘I can nudge this up a bit,’ so I went to 80, 85.”\n\nBut Fauci’s biggest lie was orchestrating a cover-up of COVID-19’s origins, likely to hide his role in funding Wuhan lab research. Unearthed emails between Fauci and Dr. Francis Collins, the former head of the National Institutes of Health, revealed a scheme to promote the natural origin theory and discredit the lab-leak hypothesis despite a lack of evidence. They commissioned a paper to this end, “The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2,” later published in Nature Medicine, edited it behind the scenes, and then cited it at a press conference as if it were independent evidence.\n\nIt was revealed later that one of the paper’s key authors, Dr. Kristian Anderson, received an $8.9 million grant from Fauci’s NIAID soon after.\n\nEstablishment media, with cooperation from social media companies, ridiculed proponents of the lab-leak theory. New York Times COVID-19 reporter Apoorva Mandavilli posted that the COVID-19 lab leak theory had “racist roots.” Today, it is the accepted explanation of COVID-19 by the FBI, CIA, and the Energy Department’s elite “Z Division.”\n\nThe many COVID-19 lies cratered public trust in governmental institutions, especially in public health, during times of crisis. The political and media establishment’s role in perpetuating COVID-19 falsehoods fostered widespread skepticism, making future efforts to address national challenges significantly more difficult.\n\n4. Biden cognitive cover-up\n\nThe most recent of the four exploded spectacularly before the eyes of the nation at the first presidential debate last summer, when the leader of the free world appeared at the debate alarmingly frail and confused.\n\nIn the months preceding the now-infamous debate, establishment politicians and media blasted videos of then-President Joe Biden wandering, shaking hands with the air, and exhibiting other behaviors of cognitive decline as “cheap fakes.”\n\nCNN’s chief media analyst, Brian Stelter, explained that the videos of Biden were designed “to trick people into believing something that’s totally false” and that they were “just distorted, out-of-context videos chopped up in certain ways, constructed in certain ways. That’s what we’re seeing.”\n\nIronically, Stelter’s CNN colleague Jake Tapper, long seen as an emblem of establishment journalism, wrote the defining book on the cover-up, detailing how Biden’s inner circle concealed his deterioration from the public and how legacy media journalists played along out of partisan loyalty and fear of being denied access.\n\nThe book registered as a political earthquake inside the Beltway, but for the general public, it only confirmed long-held suspicions about Biden’s fitness for the presidency. And with that confirmation came a slew of uncomfortable questions. For instance, who exactly was running the country during the Biden administration? And what exactly was the level of cooperation between the White House and establishment media to keep Biden’s health a secret? \n\n200 DAYS IN OFFICE: TRUMP PIVOTS TO MIDTERM ELECTIONS AFTER ‘EXCESSIVE’ SECOND 100 DAYS\n\nWe are only beginning to learn the answers to these questions, and with each new revelation, the public is reminded of the arrogance and malignancy of the elite class.\n\nThe establishment attempts to spin its downfall as a byproduct of Trump’s rise, against which they’ve cast themselves as the “resistance.” But the reverse is more likely true. Trump rose against the lies of the establishment. His Make America Great Again movement was the resistance to their misdeeds. Let it warn future establishments: Truth, not deception, builds lasting authority.","summary":"For nearly a decade, Democratic Party elites, Never Trump Republicans, and legacy media personalities have warned that the “walls are closing in” on President Donald Trump.

Here’s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: fizkes / Shutterstock)\n\nWindows 11's Recall feature has just been put through its paces\nIt did better than when it was first released in preview, but still made slips with its sensitive info filter\nIn some scenarios, this filter simply isn't keeping vital data - like credit card numbers - out of Recall's screenshots\n\nWindows 11's Recall feature is under scrutiny again with a new report claiming that, in certain situations, the functionality is capturing sensitive information as part of its daily duties (for those with Copilot+ PCs who've turned it on).\n\nAs a quick refresher, Recall is the AI-powered natural language search that's in-depth and works off regularly taken screenshots of the activity on the host PC. While it's undoubtedly powerful, it has been dogged with privacy and security concerns since it was first revealed (and the launch was a shambles, you may well recall - ahem).\nAnd some concerns remain, as a report from The Register makes clear - at least in certain scenarios with the screenshots that Recall takes, which could be a 'potential treasure trove for thieves' as the author, Avram Piltch, puts it.\n\nYou may like\n\nSignal blasts Microsoft over Recall privacy failings, as secure messaging app is forced to fudge a way of blocking the controversial Windows 11 feature\n\nWindows 11 search just got more powerful courtesy of Copilot - and I think this is a great use of AI, even if there'll still be haters\n\nWindows 11 gets a big new update – here are the top 4 features, including a powerful AI agent for Copilot+ PCs\n\nPiltch ran tests on Recall with a Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x (which is a Copilot+ laptop), finding that while the feature did manage to exclude sensitive financial details - like credit card numbers - from many of the screen grabs taken, it didn't do so all the time.\n\nSome of Recall's failures, which are reported here, include the feature taking a screenshot of a fake web page (created by the author for testing purposes) with a credit card entry form, when certain text (like 'checkout page' and 'enter payment info') was removed. Recall did successfully exclude the site from its screen-grabbing activity when those labels were present, but without them, Recall no longer recognized that the card details were sensitive info, so it still took grabs.\nAs Piltch points out, not all online shopping checkout forms look the same, and so doubt creeps in as to whether, with some websites, Recall might not be blocking out said card details.\nRecall also had security points deducted by Piltch for screen-grabbing a text file full of (made-up) usernames and passwords. If the word 'password' was present in the document somewhere, Recall wouldn't take a screenshot - but if that wasn't explicitly mentioned, it would happily take a grab of the sensitive contents. (And no, you absolutely shouldn't keep a list of your passwords in a text file, but some people do, sadly).\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nPiltch further noted that when looking at his online bank account, Recall took screenshots of pages where his balance appeared, and a list of deposits made. That could be valuable information for a malicious party that got hold of this Recall info, but the feature did block out the account number (and ABA routing), thankfully.\nWhen it came to PayPal usage, Recall took a screenshot of the login portal, which revealed the username, but not the password. Also, the feature didn't take grabs of the account page (showing recent activity and transactions), which was good, but letting the username slip still isn't great.\nRecall also recognized a photo of a passport and avoided screenshotting that. However, when another window on the desktop partially obscured some of the photo, it did take a grab, evidently failing to recognize it as a passport in that case (even though sensitive details were still visible).\n\nAnalysis: Better - but still not good enough\n\n(Image credit: Microsoft)\nThe faults outlined here are mainly about Recall failing to recognize sensitive details when they aren't clearly flagged with a label (like 'payment info') or are only partially visible (as in the case of the passport).\nHow hard should we be on Recall for this? Well, if I used Recall myself (disclaimer: I don't, and in fact I can't, because I haven't got a Copilot+ PC), I'd be disappointed at the feature stumbling on the credit card numbers and passport in particular.\nI think Recall should be sophisticated enough to pick up and recognize that grouping of card numbers (16-digit long credit card number, date, CVC) to block this out. Ditto for a partial passport photo, I feel Recall should still have been able to deal with it being somewhat obscured, in order to be judged as doing a good job in terms of its sensitive info filter.\nOn the other hand, some scenarios - a file full of passwords - aren't such a big slip in my books (those words could be anything really, and there's not such an obvious pattern there).\nStill, there is enough slipping through the filter here to be worrying. Recall, however, is still in preview officially, and Microsoft itself admits that sensitive info can be missed (and that if this happens, you should feed this back to the company, as part of testing Recall).\nSo, the long and short of it is, Recall is still being tested. It's getting better - Piltch actually ran similar tests for Tom's Hardware when Recall first debuted for public consumption (in preview), and the feature's sensitive data filter performed far worse, but it still has wrinkles as we clearly see here. That's not good enough for me, and so even if I did have a Copilot+ PC, I wouldn't be using it.\nFurthermore, I do worry whether Recall will ever be fully honed in terms of blocking out sensitive data completely, or guaranteed not to be subject to bugs where such slips might happen. (Windows 11 is well-known for never having any bugs, of course 😉). And so I can't see myself ever using the feature, frankly, because I'm also not convinced that I need this AI-assisted search anyway.\nYou don't need to turn on Recall, of course - in fact it's off by default with a Copilot+ PC.\nAlso, it's worth making it clear that an attacker would need to access your PC to get at these screenshots, which is far from an easy task. However, Piltch points out that an in-person attack (by someone who knows, or guesses, your Windows Hello PIN) is possible, and remote access isn't completely off the table, either.\nThat's not particularly comforting when you consider that a filter designed to maintain your security fully in such an eventuality isn't firing on all cylinders.\nYou might also like...\n\nMicrosoft finally plays its trump AI card, Recall, in Windows 11 – but for me, it’s completely overshadowed by another new ability for Copilot+ PCs\nWindows 11 is getting more AI shortcuts, but is Microsoft in danger of cluttering up the OS with AI creep?\nCan’t upgrade to Windows 11?

But the president’s post about Sydney Sweeney and Taylor Swift had to be deleted and reposted several times to correct spelling errors on Monday. And it speaks to the chaos going on behind the scenes as the president posts to social media when he’s supposed to be running the country.\n\nSweeney is currently at the center of an online debate about an ad for clothing company American Eagle. The actress talks about genetics in an ad that ends with a homophone-based joke about jeans and genes. Some people see the ad as a dog whistle to racists (including many of the racists themselves), and Trump was first asked about it on Sunday, when he learned that Sweeney is a registered Republican.\n\nThe president seemed excited by the fact that a popular actress might be on his team politically and really leaned into it Monday morning with a whiny, error-riddled post that went in a few different directions on “wokeness.”\n\nAs you can see, Trump’s first stab at the post about Sweeney misspelled her name as “Sidney,” says “flying of the shelves” rather than off the shelves, and spells the beer as Bud Lite rather than Bud Light. Miller is the brand that uses “Lite” rather than Light.\n\nTrump deleted and reposted the screed, fixing some of the errors and expanding the section about Taylor Swift, who he claimed was booed at the Super Bowl and “became NO LONGER HOT.” Swift was indeed booed by some people at the Super Bowl because she was there to support her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce. Swift was reportedly booed by Philadelphia Eagles fans, not because the billionaire singer has become unpopular.\n\nTrump also added a line, as you can see below, reading “Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be.” The president added another line to his second post that’s become extremely common in recent months: “Thank you for your attention to this matter.”\n\nBut the president deleted his post yet again, fixing his sentence about American Eagle jeans “flying of the shelves,” without fixing the part about Bud “Lite.”\n\nOne of the questions that people often have about Trump’s social media presence is how frequently he’s the person actually typing it out. Trump has famously never used a computer but has previously confirmed that he’s the one typing on his phone to send out many of his posts. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump said that he’s often dictating tweets during the day and it’s all his own typing at night after 7:00 p.m. But it’s unclear whether he’s stuck to that schedule.\n\nThe pro-Trump documentary series Art of the Surge showed what it was like tweeting with Trump during a speech from Kamala Harris in the 2024 campaign, and it really appeared to be a team process. Trump would dictate to the assistant sitting next to him, but plenty of other people in the room contributed ideas and suggested their own versions of talking points to people who ran other accounts associated with Trump’s campaign.\n\nIt wasn’t all celebrity nonsense on Monday morning. Trump also tried to address the fact that he fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics last week after the agency reported weak job creation numbers and revised down previous months.\n\n“Last weeks Job’s Report was RIGGED, just like the numbers prior to the Presidential Election were Rigged,” Trump wrote in a transparent lie. “That’s why, in both cases, there was massive, record setting revisions, in favor of the Radical Left Democrats. Those big adjustments were made to cover up, and level out, the FAKE political numbers that were CONCOCTED in order to make a great Republican Success look less stellar!!! I will pick an exceptional replacement. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAGA!”\n\nTrump fired Dr. Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, from her nonpartisan role on Friday, and there’s absolutely no evidence she did anything wrong. In fact, more than 2,000 people work at the BLS, according to CNN, and it would have been impossible for McEntarfer to significantly alter the data without the coordination of dozens, if not hundreds, of accomplices. And, again, there’s no evidence she did that. Trump just shot the messenger and wants to install someone who will make it look like his economy is doing better than it is. The newly revised numbers showed the U.S. added 258,000 fewer jobs in May and June than first reported, a bad sign for the future of the economy.\n\nTrump is an agent of chaos, firing off posts about anything and everything he sees on TV. But how do we know he’s mostly reacting to whatever pops up on television? Sometimes he just says as much, like when he recently said that he’s seen the starvation of children in Gaza on TV. This is a man with an entire intelligence community devoted to making sure he has the best and latest information from around the world. But he is fixated on whatever might be happening on the glowing boxes of mass media around him at all times.\n\nTrump also seemed to be talking directly to the TV on Monday when he sent a few posts about Sen. Elizabeth Warren, writing, “Ask Pocahontas the real questions, CNBC!!!” Warren was on the financial news channel to discuss Trump’s firing of the BLS commissioner, pointing out that it’s extremely dangerous. Warren said Trump seemed poised to “put in some sycophant that makes the president happy,” which clearly set him off.\n\nYou’d think the job of the president would require a little more attention to world affairs and less to the criticism he’s hearing on TV. But obviously, this is a unique era in American history. And none of this dysfunction is going to get resolved anytime soon.","summary":"The president is yelling at the TV again.","url":"https://gizmodo.com/trump-deletes-and-reposts-tweet-about-sydney-sweeney-several-times-2000638509","image":"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/08/sydney-sweeney-and-donald-trump-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-04 17:30:53","author":"Matt Novak","authors":["Matt Novak"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.027},{"id":348121778,"title":"Skydance's David Ellison shakes up Paramount leadership","text":"David Ellison's Skydance Media has unveiled its leadership structure for Paramount, beginning a shake-up as the Shari Redstone era winds to a close. Ellison will become chairman and chief executive of the new Paramount Skydance Corp. with a goal of reviving the legendary entertainment company. The structure will largely be decentralized with Ellison entrusting his division heads with considerable power. Skydance's $8.4-billion takeover is scheduled to close Thursday. RedBird Capital Partners executive and former NBCUniversal chief Jeff Shell will be the company's president, overseeing day-to-day operations of the television businesses. Only one current top Paramount executive — Co-Chief Executive George Cheeks — will remain. Cheeks becomes chairman of TV media, which includes the CBS properties and cable TV channels, including MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and BET. Dana Goldberg, who has worked with Ellison for nearly 15 years, will rise to co-chair of Paramount Pictures alongside Josh Greenstein, who until last week was Sony Pictures’ motion pictures president. In addition to overseeing the Melrose Avenue film studio, Goldberg will run Paramount Television Studios and Nickelodeon Films. In recent years, Goldberg has served as Skydance's chief creative officer. Greenstein moves back to Paramount, where he previously served as marketing president before leaving for Sony in 2014. Cindy Holland, a former top Netflix programmer, will run the streaming services, Paramount+ and Pluto, making her a major player in the new company. Holland spent 18 years at Netflix, working on such shows as \"House of Cards,\" \"Grace and Frankie,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" until her 2020 departure. She briefly ran the Elisabeth Murdoch production studio, Sister, until joining Ellison last year as an advisor. \"This world-class team is uniquely equipped to rise to the occasion and deliver on our bold vision for a new Paramount,\" Ellison said in a statement. The new organizational structure comes after the Federal Communications Commission, led by President Trump-appointed Chairman Brendan Carr, approved the Skydance-Paramount merger after a political tug-of-war with the president and his team. In late July, the FCC voted 2-1 to approve the deal and transfer 28 CBS television station licenses to billionaire Larry Ellison and his family. The sole Democrat on the panel dissented, citing a regulatory review that she said invited abuses of power. Skydance is buying Paramount with RedBird, which gives the private equity firm considerable sway in managing Paramount. In addition to Shell, former Goldman Sachs banker Andy Gordon — who led RedBird's Los Angeles office as a partner — will become Paramount's chief operating officer and chief strategy officer. Stephanie Kyoko McKinnon, Skydance's general counsel, will join Paramount in the same role, overseeing legal, regulatory, and compliance matters across the company’s global operations. She will also serve as acting chief legal officer. Melissa Zukerman becomes Paramount's chief communications officer, serving as chief spokesperson, head of global communications, social responsibility and a key Ellison advisor. Former Amazon executive Jim Sterner becomes Paramount's chief people officer, responsible for human resources and shaping the corporate culture that \"fuels innovation and long-term business success,\" the company said. Paramount's other two co-chief executives — Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins — are leaving the company this week. The Skydance takeover ends 38 years of Redstone control. Their Hollywood empire was diminished by years of cost-cutting and viewership losses which prompted Shari Redstone to find a buyer in late 2023. Her family was seeking an exit amid their mounting debts. Redstone, the daughter of entertainment titan Sumner Redstone, and Paramount's board agreed to the Skydance takeover in July 2024 after months of drama and churn among its board of directors. As part of the transaction, the Redstone family investment firm National Amusements will receive $2.4 billion for its controlling shares in the company. Those shares will pass to Larry Ellison and RedBird, which will hold a minority stake in National Amusements. The deal is expected to inject $1.5 billion into Paramount's balance sheet to help the firm pay down debt. The Ellison's Santa Monica based Skydance will eventually be folded into Paramount. Skydance is expected to usher in additional steep rounds of layoffs at Paramount. RedBird executives have promised Wall Street that it will find $2 billion in cost savings. The controversial FCC vote approving the Skydance-Paramount merger came just three weeks after Paramount agreed to pay Trump $16 million to settle the president’s lawsuit over edits to a “60 Minutes” broadcast last fall. Trump had claimed CBS producers deceptively edited the October interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris to enhance her election chances. CBS denied his allegations, saying the edits were routine. The unedited video showed that while Harris' answer was clipped, she was accurately quoted. 1st Amendment experts and journalists decried the settlement, which will steer much of the money to Trump's future presidential library. Trump has said that Skydance is throwing in another $20 million in public service announcements and other free programming as part of the lawsuit settlement. Trump has said on social media the value of his payout was about $36 million. As part of its agreement with the FCC, Ellison pledged to abandon all diversity, equity and inclusion programs at Paramount. Skydance also agreed to “promote transparency and increased accountability” at CBS News. The company said it would install an ombudsman, reporting to Shell, “to receive and evaluate any complaints of bias or other concerns involving CBS” for at least two years.","summary":"Longtime Ellison lieutenant Dana Goldberg will run Paramount Pictures with former Sony executive, Josh Greenstein.

It's for American Eagle, and the jeans are \"flying off the shelves.\" Go get ‘em Sydney!' the president said. \n\nTrump then called attention to the controversy surrounding a recent Jaguar ad, which prompted the car company's CEO to step down. \n\nThe ad showed androgynous models - and zero cars - with some conservative critics referring to it as 'Bud Light 2.0.' \n\nNigel Farage and Elon Musk accused the carmaker of abandoning its 'jag-man' heritage.\n\n'On the other side of the ledger, Jaguar did a stupid, and seriously WOKE advertisement, THAT IS A TOTAL DISASTER!' Trump said. 'The CEO just resigned in disgrace, and the company is in absolute turmoil.' \n\nPresident Donald Trump called Sydney Sweeney's ad for American Eagle the '\"HOTTEST\" ad out there' in a Truth Social post Monday, where he also pit Sweeney against the liberal-leaning singer Taylor Swift \n\nPresident Donald Trump took to Truth Social Monday morning to share his newfound appreciation for actress Sydney Sweeney, who he complimented after finding out she registered as a Republican in 2024 \n\n'Who wants to buy a Jaguar after looking at that disgraceful ad,' the president asked. 'Shouldn't they have learned a lesson from Bud Lite, which went Woke and essentially destroyed, in a short campaign, the Company.'\n\nThe 78-year-old Republican then turned his attention to Swift, who endorsed both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in 2020 and 2024, respectively. \n\nThe unspoken truth about Trump's inner circle and Melania's unparalleled control\n\n'Or just look at Woke singer Taylor Swift. Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can’t stand her (HATE!). She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT,' Trump claimed.\n\n'The tide has seriously turned - Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be,' Trump said. \n\nHe ended the Truth Social post with his trademark, 'Thank you for your attention to this matter!' \n\nOn Sunday night, the Daily Mail had asked Trump if he had any reaction to the Daily Mail and other outlets reporting that Sweeney had registered as a Republican in 2024. \n\n'She's a registered Republican?' the president said with interest on the tarmac of the Lehigh Valley International Airport outside of Allentown, Pennsylvania. \n\nTrump was heading back to Washington after spending the weekend at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf resort. \n\n'You'd be surprised at how many people are Republican. That's one I wouldn't have known, but I'm glad you told me that,' he continued. \n\n'If Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think her ad is fantastic.' \n\nSweeney is a member of the Republican Party of Florida, according to public voter records viewed by the Daily Mail. \n\nSinger Taylor Swift (left) can be seen with actress Blake Lively (right). President Donald Trump again criticized Swift, who endorsed the Republican's last two rivals, President Joe Biden in the 2020 election and Vice President Kamala Harris in their 2024 fight \n\nPresident Donald Trump was asked Sunday night by the Daily Mail for his reaction to actress Sydney Sweeney being registered as a Republican. 'If Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think her ad is fantastic,' he said \n\nShe registered in Monroe County, Florida in June 2024.\n\nBuzzfeed was the first outlet to report Sweeney's voter registration. \n\nSweeney has been criticized for the American Eagle ad, which used the tagline 'Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans,' with some critics saying it sounded like 'Nazi propaganda.' \n\nA number of conservatives and MAGA personalities have come out in her defense. \n\nDemocratic lawmakers have largely stayed away from the conversation, though Democratic Rep.

I really do. I think that they know this is the issue that has gotten the base riled up, the MAGA base isn’t letting this issue go and for the first time they can probably take their party back and not piss off the MAGA base. I think they’re going to do that.”\n\nThe Epstein case has dominated news coverage in recent weeks after the Justice Department said it will not be releasing any additional documents from the Epstein sex trafficking investigation. The decision has infuriated online sleuths, conspiracy theorists and elements of Trump’s base who had hoped to see proof of a government cover-up.\n\nOfficials have said Epstein killed himself in his New York jail cell while awaiting trial in 2019, but his case has generated endless attention and conspiracy theories because of his links to famous people, including Trump and other billionaires.\n\nTrump on social media called Charlamagne a “racist sleazebag” and criticized his use of God in his professional nickname.\n\n“Can anyone imagine the uproar there would be if I used that nickname?” Trump asked.\n\nCharlamagne, who co-hosts a nationally syndicated radio show, “The Breakfast Club,” told Lara Trump that his criticism of the Republican president was not new, adding that he “gave President Biden the same hell” when he didn’t think the Democrat was doing a good job.","summary":"Charlamagne said he wouldn't rate Trump's presidency highly, citing negative impacts on vulnerable communities.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/08/04/trump-attacks-charlamagne/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/My_View_with_Lara_Trump__47332-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-04 17:11:53","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.303},{"id":348098300,"title":"Watch the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 go through a torturous durability test that I can't believe it survived","text":"Skip to main content\n\nTechRadar the technology experts\n\nSearch TechRadar\n\nView Profile\n\nBelgië (Nederlands)\n\nDeutschland\n\nNorth America\n\nUS (English)\n\nAustralasia\n\nNew Zealand\n\nTech Radar Pro\n\nTech Radar Gaming\n\nBack to school\nBest laptop\n\nNintendo Switch 2\nNYT Wordle today\nBest web hosting\n\nRecommended reading\n\nSamsung Galaxy Phones\nI showed the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 to a Z Fold 4 owner, and he was blown away\n\nSamsung Galaxy Phones\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 can handle far more folds than the Z Fold 6 – but still pales in comparison to the OnePlus Open\n\nSamsung Galaxy Phones\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 crushed the Z Fold 6 in pre-orders, and I think foldable phones are finally having a moment\n\nSamsung Galaxy Phones\nI went hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, and it matches the Motorola Razr Ultra in one key area\n\nSamsung Galaxy Phones\nI've used every Samsung flagship, here's why the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is one of the best\n\nSamsung Galaxy Phones\nI can forgive losing the S Pen, but the Samsung Z Fold 7 has been ruined by a more serious design faux pas\n\nSamsung Galaxy Phones\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 fixes my biggest complaint, but I'd still never buy one – here's why\n\nSamsung Galaxy Phones\n\nWatch the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 go through a torturous durability test that I can't believe it survived\n\nHamish Hector \n\n4 August 2025\n\nBruised but not defeated\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

The inner screen is left with a couple of permanent green damage marks after about 15 seconds of fire exposure.\n\nIt then gets drenched in dirt, including getting a healthy heaping dropped straight into its hinge. Opening and closing the phone with dirt covered did allow some soil to enter the mechanism – you can hear it crunch when opening and closing after the fact – but at least during the video, no other permanent harm is noticeable.\nLastly, JerryRigEverything does his best to snap the phone in half with his hands, but it survives his attempts.\nYou should absolutely go watch the full video – especially if, like me, you’re too cautious with your tech to let the intrusive thoughts win – because it highlights the extreme lengths you have to go to actually tear these foldables apart.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nTougher than you think\n\nFoldables are hardier than we give them credit for (Image credit: Peter Hoffmann)\nI’ve used a foldable as my daily driver for about a year. I started with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and recently upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nBecause I get those phones through my job, I’m admittedly a bit more laissez-faire with how I treat them (meaning I’ll buy a cheap screen protector, but not a case), but both phones have been holding up very, very well.\nThe Z Fold 6 has a few bruises at the edges, but nothing serious, and my Z Fold 7 is close to immaculate. Neither has any issues with their hinges, and while you can see their creases, it’s not super noticeable on either phone when you’re using one.\nThis brings me to a point I made on our Samsung special podcast. While that IP48 dust and waterproof rating means the foldables can let fine dirt in (anything smaller than 1mm), and their inner screen isn’t as durable as a regular phone display, most normal people probably won’t have any serious issues.\nI’ve been to a sandy beach two times in the past year, and visited one desert, without my foldable being affected. I was careful, sure, but no more so than I am with a non-foldable.\nIf you regularly work at the beach or in, say, a dusty woodwork shop, or in a super-harsh environment, a foldable might not be ideal. But for most folks, these extreme and my year-long tests prove they’re surprisingly durable if you’re kind to them. If durability was the reason you’ve been put off buying one, it might not be as big an issue as you imagine.\nYou might also like\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S26 could come with multiple AI assistants\nA YouTuber is folding and unfolding the Galaxy Z Fold 7 200,000 times\nThis rumored Samsung Galaxy S26 upgrade will finally make contactless payments as easy as they are on the iPhone\n\nSee more News about Phones\n\nHamish Hector\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nSenior Staff Writer, News\n\nHamish is a Senior Staff Writer for TechRadar and you’ll see his name appearing on articles across nearly every topic on the site from smart home deals to speaker reviews to graphics card news and everything in between.

Moran wrote on his personal Substack that ABC News has fallen into the trap of lacking “viewpoint diversity,” particularly when it came to Trump.\n\n“Were we biased? Yes. Almost inadvertently, I’d say. ABC News has the same problem so many leading cultural institutions do in America: A lack of viewpoint diversity,” Moran wrote. (RELATED: Terry Moran Says Journalists Not Supposed To Be ‘Objective’)\n\n Amazing stuff from @TerryMoran on whether @ABC is biased against @realDonaldTrump cc: @seanspicer @danturrentine Were we biased? Yes. Almost inadvertently, I’d say. ABC News has the same problem so many leading cultural institutions do in America: A lack of viewpoint… — Mark Halperin (@MarkHalperin) August 3, 2025 \n\nMoran said that while ABC News made an effort to hire people from various backgrounds, there were hardly any staffers who supported Trump or understood his base. The lack of Trump supporters at ABC News inevitably caused “weirdly anthropological and inaccurate” reporting from ABC journalists who covered Trump or attended his rallies, Moran added.\n\n“It is no secret. There are hardly any people who supported Donald Trump at ABC News or the other corporate/legacy/mainstream news networks. And this is bound to impact coverage, not so much out of malevolent bias (that’s the cartoon version peddled by Trump, Brendan Carr and online MAGA), but more out of what is a kind of deafness,” Moran said.\n\n“The old news divisions don’t hear many of the voices of the country, because those voices aren’t in the newsroom,” Moran continued. “Yes, news teams go out with a microphone and a camera and accost people at Trump rallies; but to me that often comes off as weirdly anthropological and inaccurate, kind of like trying to understand nature by visiting a zoo. You don’t really see a tiger at the zoo, just a version of a tiger.”\n\nMoran, who interviewed Trump from the Oval Office in April, accused Miller in June of being “richly endowed with the capacity for hatred,” that his “hatreds are his spiritual nourishment” and that he “eats his hate.” He also accused Trump of being a “world-class hater” in the same X post.\n\nMiller responded that Moran and others in the corporate press are “radicals adopting a journalist’s post.”\n\n“The most important fact about Terry’s full public meltdown is what it shows about the corporate press in America,” Miller said in an X post from June 8. “For decades, the privileged anchors and reporters narrating and gatekeeping our society have been radicals adopting a journalist’s pose. Terry pulled off his mask.”\n\nMoran then stated that Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Brendan Carr can “go to hell” over his appointment of a “bias monitor” to oversee coverage at CBS News. This condition stemmed from the Trump administration’s approval of a $8 billion sale of Paramount, CBS’ parent company, to SkyDance Media.\n\n“The CEOs always think they can somehow pacify Trump or buy him off with concessions. And they are always wrong. Does this sound like a man who’s done trying to muscle the media into MAGA messaging?” Moran wrote.\n\nDuring his April interview with Trump, Moran challenged Trump to order El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele to return alleged MS-13 member Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador deported by the Trump administration in March. The administration acknowledged that Garcia’s deportation was a clerical error but held firm that he should have been removed from the U.S., particularly due to his alleged criminal gang association.\n\nABC News paid $15 million to settle Trump’s defamation lawsuit against the network in December after “This Week” host George Stephanopoulos falsely claimed in March 2024 that the then-president-elect was found liable of rape. CBS News and Paramount agreed to pay $36 million in total to settle a separate lawsuit brought against Trump, which alleged that the network deceptively edited a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris to bolster her chances in the 2024 election.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The system-on-a-chip manufacturer that those firms use has since updated its SDK to deal with the issue, though we'd be foolish to assume it's the only one.\n\nThe presence of a vulnerability in a chip doesn't mean it has been or is going to be exploited. But it's a possibility. Last year BlueSpy demonstrated how to take advantage of such a vulnerability to record audio from \"a particular high-end headset\". And this year it emerged that a Bluetooth vulnerability could enable eavesdropping on in-car calls.\nThe risks from wireless devices aren't just interception. For example, the UK's Ministry of Justice notes that Bluetooth devices can be used to track someone's location. It also tells staff that while Bluetooth is fine for people working with \"Official\"-level material, it may not be safe enough for \"Official-Sensitive or higher material\".\nThe likelihood of the average pair of headphones or earbuds being intercepted by anyone is vanishingly small. And that's probably just as well, because 3.5mm audio jacks are vanishing too – although of course you could always use a USB-C adapter or DAC to go wired. But most of the best headphones today are wireless ones, especially for wearing outdoors – and doubly so if you want active noise cancellation.

And I think this is beautiful. \n\n“They tried to destroy this woman, and her value is going up. She is just not beautiful, but she can shoot, too? We’re done here. It’s just beautiful.”\n\nThe footage of Sweeney at the gun range was shared by Taran Tactical Innovations, an online firearms retailer, on Saturday.\n\nLeft-leaning critics of the American Eagle ad campaign have accused the company of spreading “racist” and “Nazi propaganda.” Some have argued that it pushes eugenic ideals with its wordplay on “jeans” and “genes.”\n\nCritics have argued that the two phrases harken back to the debunked racist theory pushed by the Nazis that the human race can be improved via selective breeding. \n\n“Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality, and even eye color,” Sweeney says in one of the ads. \n\n“My jeans are blue,” she adds, before a narrator says, “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.”\n\nFox News took notes from Trump’s playbook and seemingly used the controversy surrounding the ad to avoid discussing the scandal enveloping the administration in connection with the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nLiberal media watchdog Media Matters for America found that Fox News spent more than 85 minutes during at least 20 segments discussing the ad through Thursday afternoon. Meanwhile, Fox discussed the Epstein files for about three minutes even as Trump claimed that Epstein “stole” one of his accusers, the late Virginia Giuffre, from Mar-a-Lago. Media Matters found that Fox News mentioned Sweeney 62 times, while just mentioning Epstein 14 times. \n\nTrump heaped praise on the jeans ad after Sweeney’s political leanings were reported. The president addressed reporters on the runway in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Sunday night. \n\n“She’s a registered Republican?” Trump asked. “Now I love her ad.”\n\nPreviously, on Sunday, it emerged that since June of last year, Sweeney has been registered with the Republican Party of Florida, according to public voting records viewed by The Guardian. \n\n“Is that right? Is Sydney Sweeney… You’d be surprised how many people are Republicans. That’s one I wouldn’t have known, but I’m glad you told me that,” said Trump. \n\n“If Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think her ad is fantastic,” he added. \n\n“‘Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans’ is and always was about the jeans,” American Eagle said in a response to the criticism. “Her jeans. Her story.”\n\n“We’ll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way,” the statement added. “Great jeans look good on everyone.”\n\nTrump took to Truth Social on Monday morning to say that “Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the ‘HOTTEST’ ad out there.” \n\n“It’s for American Eagle, and the jeans are ‘flying off the shelves,’” he claimed. \n\nThe president went on to criticise “WOKE” advertising, before taking aim at Taylor Swift, who endorsed his opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, ahead of the 2024 election. \n\n“Or just look at Woke singer Taylor Swift. Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can’t stand her (HATE!),” he said. “She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT.”\n\nTrump went on to say that “WOKE is for losers” and that the “Republican Party is what you want to be.”","summary":"Euphoria star courted controversy with her recent “good jeans” ad for American Eagle, which some have argued carries racist messaging, prompting outrage from the right in response","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fox-news-sydney-sweeney-gun-range-b2801667.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/04/7/38/Americana-special-screening-in-Los-Angeles-7d2b3riu.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/2uuoEAFT-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-04 16:24:36","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":348130042,"title":"‘It’ll be carnage’: why Sydney Sweeney’s risky political moment may backfire","text":"It is one of the questionable perks of Donald Trump’s “wall of sound” approach to communication that the slightly icky moment when the world of Maga and one of Hollywood’s hottest young stars connected was broadcast live and uncut.\n\nAs the US president boarded Air Force One, a reporter asked whether he had any thoughts on Sydney Sweeney, a “very hot actress right now”, being a registered Republican. Of course he did.\n\n“She’s a registered Republican? Ooh, now I love her ad. Is that right? Is Sydney Sweeney … You’d be surprised at how many people are Republicans. That’s what I wouldn’t have known. But I’m glad you told me that. If Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think her ad is fantastic.”\n\nSweeney, for the uninitiated, and there can’t be many, first gained prominence for her roles in HBO’s Euphoria and The White Lotus and more recently co-starred in the thriller Echo Valley with Julianne Moore.\n\nIt has, however, been the 27-year-old’s “more is best” approach to commercial tie-ups and a tendency for the social media algorithms to promote her that has made the actor inescapable.\n\nShe is everywhere, smiling with a dab of rejuvenating cream on her face, straining to inject cool into clog-shaped black loafers or taking selfies with a dog to promote Samsung flip phones.\n\nShe can even be found in your bath tub thanks to a collaboration with a men’s personal care company to create a soap called Sydney’s Bathwater Bliss that contains a small amount of the actual water in which she has washed.\n\nHer latest advertising campaign has led her into more dangerous waters. “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair colour, personality, and even eye colour,” she purrs in an advert for American Eagle denims. “My genes are blue,” she says as the camera lingers on her eyes. The strap line: Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.\n\nThe whiff of controversy was inevitably picked up with claims that the ad was elevating the white, blond and blue eyed.\n\nOne TikTok reaction video that received hundreds of thousands of likes commented “it’s literally giving … Nazi propaganda”. JD Vance, never one to miss such a moment, criticised the unhinged Dems and hailed an “all-American beautiful woman”. “So much of the Democrats is oriented around hostility to basic American life,” he added.\n\nThen, amid the extra scrutiny of the woman behind the storm, it emerged that Sweeney had registered as a Republican voter in Florida a few months before Trump won his second US presidency.\n\nAs Trump’s delight illustrated, the benefit to the president is clear, said David Cracknell, a former political editor of Rupert Murdoch’s Sunday Times who now runs his own PR company.\n\nThere is a long history of politicians chasing the celebrity endorsement, with JFK among the earliest to spot the benefits of having Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr on his side.\n\nLast summer, Harvard University’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation published research that suggested celebrity voices could be “incredibly powerful” in promoting civic engagement and altering polling numbers. Online voter registration and poll worker volunteer rates were found to increase when a celebrity promoted them.\n\nCelebrity endorsements from the likes of Taylor Swift and Oprah Winfrey did not help Kamala Harris’s cause at the last election but the tacit endorsement of a young woman could be particularly helpful at a time when Trump is under pressure over his past relationship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. However, Cracknell said the upside for the celebrity was far less clear.\n\n“It usually does end in tears when any celebrity gets involved in politics, just look at Kanye West and how his endorsement for Trump was mixed up with his reputational downfall,” said Cracknell. “Then he said later that he felt used by Trump. More fool you for getting involved because the politicians are much better at manipulating the media, they are doing it on a second by second basis, Trump literally.”\n\nMark Borkowski, whose PR clients have included Michael Jackson, Joan Rivers and Van Morrison, said avoiding political entanglements, particularly in the infancy of a career when hopefuls rely on goodwill from all sides, was vital.\n\nWhen Taylor Swift praised two Democratic candidates in her home state of Tennessee back in 2018 it led to a fearsome backlash but she stuck to her guns, going on to back Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIt can hardly be said that her career has suffered but Swift was established, said Borkowski, as were other celebrities, such as John Wayne and Charlton Heston who threw themselves into political causes, the former with the Republican party and the latter the civil rights movement and then the National Rifle Association.\n\n“I am fascinated by Sydney Sweeney,” Borkowski said. “She’s become the sort of delicious siren of the gen Z media. She has got all the echoes of Jayne Mansfield or Marilyn Monroe, but she’s totally overpromoted.\n\n“She’s clickbait and it’s the worst idea to declare a political affiliation, especially in the inferno that is American discourse. It’s a massive PR risk because she hasn’t made it yet. She is not Margot Robbie, she does not have Oscars behind her.”\n\nAs if to illustrate the danger for celebrities who dip a toe in American politics, Trump later doubled down on his Truth Social platform to praise Sweeney’s instincts and castigate Swift.\n\nHe said: “Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can’t stand her (HATE!) She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became NO LONGER HOT.\n\n“The tide has seriously turned – Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”\n\nSweeney is yet to comment on her political sympathies but plenty of others, beyond Trump, will have a say, said Borkowski. “Silence in politics is really important now because if you don’t, you’re going to be exposed by the full weight of the opposition on social media,” he said. “It’ll be carnage. She’s a bombshell, but she’s not box office yet.”","summary":"Hollywood star’s ‘more is best’ attitude to commercial tie-ins is one thing, but politics and celebrity rarely mix well\n\nIt is one of the questionable perks of Donald Trump’s “wall of sound” approach to communication that the slightly icky moment when the world of Maga and one of Hollywood’s hottest young stars connected was broadcast live and uncut.\n\nAs the US president boarded Air Force One, a reporter asked whether he had any thoughts on Sydney Sweeney, a “very hot actress right now”, being a registered Republican.

(RELATED: Kamala Harris Delivers Word Salad Instead Of Naming Democratic Party Leader)\n\n“If you finish in the last place in your fantasy football league you will be locked in a room with no phone until you finish reading every single page of Kamala Harris’ new book and then you finish all 500 pages you will be retired to give the entire league a presentation and if the presentation does not pass ChatGPT standards, you will be required to listen to the audiobook for 24 hours straight,” Mac said.\n\n“You’re the guy that would, you’d make that happen, wouldn’t you? You would actually do that? You know, that’s cruel and unusual punishment. You know that?” Varney asked Portnoy as he started chuckling.\n\n“Some people say there’s no punishment worse than death, I think this one is,” Portnoy responded. “Yeah, this is a bad punishment.”\n\nHarris gave answers that were described as “word salad” during interviews during her tenure as vice president. She flubbed the Pledge of Allegiance while presiding over the Senate during one of her last days as vice president in January.\n\nHarris appeared on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” on CBS Thursday to promote her book, during which she cackled when asked specifics about the book, decried a “broken system” she spent over two decades in and refused to say who led the Democratic Party. She also posted a TikTok video in which she botched an online trend.\n\nIn October 2024, CBS reportedly edited one of her responses to a question during an interview that aired on “60 Minutes.” The company eventually settled a $10 billion lawsuit with President Donald Trump for $36 million in July despite internal opposition to the deal.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Go get ‘em Sydney!”\n\nThough the Euphoria star has not commented on it publicly, a recent piece from BuzzFeed reported that she has been a registered Republican since 2024, when Trump won his second of three presidential runs. The report came shortly after Sweeney made headlines for her controversial American Eagle commercials, in which the actress — who is a white woman with blonde hair and blue eyes — boasted about having both “great jeans” and “great genes” — something that upset many consumers who compared the ad’s messaging to Nazi propaganda.\n\nTrump, however, is clearly a fan of the campaign. As for Swift, who has opposed his policies numerous times, the twice-impeached POTUS wrote Monday, “Just look at Woke singer Taylor Swift.”\n\n“Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can’t stand her (HATE!),” he continued. “She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT. The tide has seriously turned — Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”\n\nBillboard has reached out to Swift’s rep for comment.\n\nTrump’s message is far from the first time he’s dissed the 14-time Grammy winner. Her first time speaking about politics was to endorse Democratic candidate Phil Bresden for Senate in 2018, shortly after which the president said he liked her music “25% less.”\n\nIn the years since, Trump’s attacks on the singer have heated up as she’s repeatedly endorsed his opponents for president, most recently backing Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. A few days after she posted in support of the former VP, he wrote on Truth Social, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” And this past February, he claimed that fans at the Super Bowl booed her “out of the stadium,” when, in reality, the musician stayed for the entire game and only received boos from a few Philadelphia Eagles fans who were this year’s rivals to Swift’s team of choice, the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nIn May, Trump again lobbed insults at Swift, posting out of the blue: “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?'”\n\nIt’s unclear why, months later, Trump is bringing the Eras Tour headliner back up on his social media platform, or how she’s related to the controversy surrounding Sweeney and American Eagle. The fashion brand, for it’s part, recently responded to the backlash, posting a statement on Instagram asserting that the campaign “is and always was about the jeans.”\n\n“We’ll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way,” the company added on Aug. 1. “Great jeans look good on everyone.”\n\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\n\nWant to know what everyone in the music business is talking about?\n\nGet in the know on\n\nVisit Billboard Pro for music business news\n\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.
