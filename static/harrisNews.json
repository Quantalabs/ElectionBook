THIS IS DEEPER THAN POLITICS. HE BEAT THE F---ING MEDIA HE IS MY F---ING HERO RIGHT NOW.”\n\nDespite admitting in 2016 that she felt “so dumb for ever having added my two cents to this election mess,” it’s nine years later and the “212” singer is still letting her political opinions be known. \n\nUnsurprisingly, Banks seems to have changed her opinion on Trump yet again. She is now turning her back on the man she once claimed was her “f---ing hero” and calling him out on his “crazy old white man anger.” \n\nShe wrote on X Wednesday: “He’s so petty and vindictive rn. Tbh, rightfully so, but not when the wellbeing and livelihood of billions of people—damn near the entire world lay in ur hands. Someone needs to get him a cute little lorazepam rx and a high grade ashwaganda [sic] supplement because it can’t happen like this.”\n\nShe added: “Nobody on earth is afraid of crazy old white man anger. Old white men need to reinvent the archetype because it’s too predictable. Like China is just DUNKING on everyone right now.”\n\nBanks showed her support for the president last year after she was spotted at a Trump rally in Miami. \n\nYet Banks said she would not be voting for Trump because of Elon Musk, whose home she bizarrely claimed to have been trapped in for days while waiting for Grimes in 2018, being part of his campaign.\n\n“That man kidnaps his children, took photos of grimes getting sliced open during her c-section and sent them around, does a s--tton of grimy f---ed up s--t to tesla factory workers, stole PayPal, Weasled his way into tesla and has too many passports for my liking,” she remarked about Musk in November. \n\nDespite claiming to endorse Kamala Harris because of Musk who “belongs no where near American Politics. The End,” she shared a photo of her filled out ballot in November revealing: “Lmao I lied, I voted for Trump yesterday.”\n\nAfter his win, she posted on Instagram how “proud as f---” she was of him and also to “apologize to Donald Trump for all the stupid jokes I made. (I was kidding)” and for letting the “liberal media sway” her opinion of him. \n\nShe even offered to perform at his inauguration, sharing on Facebook how it would be “an EPIC moment in modern history and it should def be celebrated in style.”","summary":"Tim Mosenfelder/Getty ImagesAzealia Banks went from calling President Donald Trump her “f---ing hero” to a “f---ing mess.” \n\nShe posted her thoughts about the president on X Wednesday, writing: “Ok I think it’s time everyone who voted for Trump admit that we made a f---ing mess.”\n\nOk I think it’s time everyone who voted for Trump admit that we made a fucking mess\n\n&mdash; Azealia Banks (@azealiaslacewig) April 16, 2025Read more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-supporting-rapper-turns-on-him-absolute-disaster/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/5SGYVZPC4ZFC5NI7CTJGTZBE7E.jpg?smart=true&auth=5c5d12f1da673197bdbf66a47ac3efab105d9c3cffcb251fd9eb597ef9ad3abc&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 22:34:03","author":"Jasmine Venet","authors":["Jasmine Venet"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":312267878,"title":"Joe Biden ‘having trouble booking gigs’ with $300K per speech asking price","text":"WASHINGTON — It’s not just Biden family artwork that’s struggling to sell these days.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden’s attempt to bill $300,000 per speaking appearance is finding few takers, The Post has learned — as some of his own former aides say it’s time for the 82-year-old to leave the spotlight for good after reminiscing about “colored kids” Tuesday in his first public address since leaving office.\n\nA source familiar with Biden’s faltering speaking career said that the 46th president’s standard pitch is $300,000 — 25% below Barack Obama’s $400,000 asking price upon leaving office in 2017. \n\nIt’s unclear how negotiable Biden’s rate is.\n\nIf travel is required, a private jet and expenses for five staffers also is expected for Biden, who has been repped since early February by the Creative Artists Agency.\n\n“CAA is having trouble booking gigs, which isn’t surprising,” the tipster said.\n\nA second source said they heard people close to Biden floating an even higher desired fee, despite the ex-commander in chief having a history of peddling glaring inaccuracies before his political career came to a crashing end when he delivered incoherent debate remarks that prompted a Democratic mutiny.\n\nBiden’s use of “colored” to refer to black people while speaking at a disability conference in Chicago earlier this week has some former aides hoping he will spend more time at his Rehoboth Beach house.\n\n“This was hard to watch,” said one former White House official. “It felt like seeing someone you care about start to regress. We just wanted him to enjoy retirement like other presidents — not go out like this.”\n\nThe ex-aide noted that minority staffers had been growing disillusioned even during Biden’s presidency.\n\n“Black people elected Joe Biden, and then his senior team cut them off, even staff hired to help with engagement,” this person said.\n\nBiden’s first known speech since leaving office took place March 15 at a National High School Model United Nations conference (NHSMUN), followed by his Tuesday address to the group Advocates, Counselors, and Representatives for the Disabled (ACRD).\n\nOn Wednesday, the former president spoke to an invitation-only Harvard Institute of Politics seminar arranged by his longtime aide Mike Donilon. \n\nA Harvard spokesman said Biden was not paid for that visit.\n\nSpokespeople for NHSMUN and ACRD did not respond to requests for comment about whether they paid Biden — and if so, what amount.\n\nThe precise reason that Biden is struggling to find top-dollar audiences is unclear.\n\nThe quality of potential remarks aside, some former aides say that CAA — which declined to comment for this story, and which also reps former Vice President Kamala Harris — may be ill-positioned to book lucrative business conference gigs.\n\nAn alternate theory holds that interest in Biden’s thoughts will build over time. \n\nOne source close to Biden’s post-presidential office said that signing with CAA was a “bad decision.”\n\nThe Harry Walker Agency, which works with both Bill and Hillary Clinton as well as Obama, “has relationships with all these large annual conferences and clients looking for high-profile speakers,” this person said.\n\n“CAA is a Hollywood shop. They’re not set up to market speakers to, like, the national duty-free shopping conference. The bread and butter of paid speaking gigs is random large annual industry conferences.”\n\nA different source concurred in that assessment, but added they believed Biden could rebound.\n\n“I do not think he is a draw yet,” this former staffer said. “I think he will be more of a draw as Trump continues to dismantle our democracy.”\n\nBiden had little trouble raking in big sums post-vice presidency — as did his brother James and son Hunter, who offered their consulting services to foreign patrons during and after his eight years as Obama’s second-in-command.\n\nMuch of Biden’s prior success in the public speaking business came from colleges, which may have soured on the former president after he spent four years in the White House railing against the high cost of education and the ensuing burden of college debt.\n\nHis post-VP windfall included $190,000 to speak at Drew University in New Jersey; $182,000 from Lake Michigan College, a community college; $180,000 to appear at Vanderbilt University; $180,000 to speak at the University of Buffalo; $125,000 to visit Southern Connecticut State University; $100,000 to speak at Long Island University, and $93,000 to visit Brown University, according to public disclosures.\n\nA Biden spokesperson did not offer comment.","summary":"\"We just wanted him to enjoy retirement like other presidents,\" said one ex-administration official, \"not go out like this.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/17/us-news/joe-biden-having-trouble-booking-gigs-with-300k-per-speech-asking-price/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/newspress-collage-nq75kwxyo-1744924165584.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1744909800&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/4ljuCEUl-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-17 21:46:08","author":"Steven Nelson","authors":["Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.325},{"id":312262036,"title":"A Survey Suggests Most Americans Are Not Keen on Trump's Speech-Based Deportation Initiative","text":"By trying to deport student activists he describes as antisemitic \"terrorist sympathizers,\" you might think, President Donald Trump is cannily choosing unpopular targets who are unlikely to attract much public support. But recent polling by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) suggests most Americans are not fans of that speech-chilling initiative.\n\nAccording to the latest iteration of FIRE's quarterly National Speech Index survey, which was conducted from April 4 through April 11, just 26 percent of Americans \"support\" or \"strongly support\" a policy of \"deporting foreigners legally in the United States on a student visa for expressing pro-Palestine views,\" while 52 percent—twice as many— \"oppose\" or \"strongly oppose\" that policy. The rest were undecided.\n\nWhen FIRE asked about \"deporting foreigners legally in the United States with a green card for expressing pro-Palestine views,\" the results were similar. While 23 percent of respondents thought that was a good idea, 53 percent disagreed, and 23 percent took no position.\n\n\"Deporting someone simply for disagreeing with the government's foreign policy preferences strikes at the very freedoms the First Amendment was designed to protect,\" says Sean Stevens, FIRE's chief research adviser. \"Americans are right to reject this kind of viewpoint-based punishment.\"\n\nThe results might have been different, of course, if the targeted views had been described as \"anti-Israel,\" which would be a fair characterization of the campus protests inspired by the war that Hamas started on October 7, 2023. The respondents might have been even less inclined to reject \"viewpoint-based punishment\" if the survey had asked about foreigners with \"pro-Hamas,\" \"pro-terrorist,\" or \"anti-Semitic\" views, the more tendentious labels that Trump and his underlings prefer.\n\nStill, assuming the respondents were familiar with this controversy and understood the range of opinions covered by the phrase \"pro-Palestine views,\" the results suggest that Americans are more skeptical of speech-based deportation than Trump probably expected. They might be even more worried if they recognized the startling breadth of the statutory authority on which Trump is relying to expel people whose views offend him, based on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's unilateral determination that they pose a threat to U.S. foreign policy interests.\n\nAmericans also seem leery of Trump's efforts to peremptorily deport suspected gang members, sometimes based on weakly supported allegations. Sixty-four percent of respondents said they opposed \"deporting foreigners legally in the United States for having a soccer tattoo that was interpreted as a gang tattoo.\"\n\nThat specific scenario alludes to Jerce Reyes Barrios, one of the Venezuelans who were deported and consigned to a notorious prison in El Salvador last month, in apparent defiance of a court order. As Reason's Eric Boehm noted, Reyes Barrios, an asylum seeker, seems to have been identified as a member of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua largely because of his \"tattoo of a soccer ball with a crown and the Spanish word Dios,\" which his lawyer said signified that he was \"a former professional soccer player and a fan of Real Madrid,\" as opposed to a dangerously violent gangster.\n\nThe unchallenged reliance on such evidence, which also has figured in other deportation cases, primarily implicates the Fifth Amendment right to due process. But there is also a First Amendment angle when the government treats body art as proof of criminality, which presumably is why FIRE included this question.\n\nWhile tattoo-based deportation seems decidedly unpopular, the FIRE survey suggests that Americans are less upset about Trump's financial pressure on universities. Just 37 percent of respondents said they opposed \"rescinding federal funding from colleges and universities for not doing enough to combat anti-Semitism on campus.\" Opposition to \"rescinding federal funding from colleges and universities that fail to disband DEI programs\" and \"rescinding federal funding from colleges and universities that fail to arrest student protesters who express pro-Palestine views\" was stronger: 45 percent and 47 percent, respectively.\n\nThe survey also found that 50 percent of Americans completely reject the proposition that \"the First Amendment goes too far in the rights it guarantees.\" Although that result may strike civil libertarians as disappointing, it is the highest level of support for freedom of speech recorded in response to this question since the first National Speech Index survey in January 2024, when 56 percent of respondents were at least \"slightly\" inclined to agree that First Amendment protections are too broad. That number has dropped steadily since then.\n\nBy contrast, Americans' impression of how free speech is faring in the United States has fluctuated since the first survey. In January 2024, 69 percent of respondents thought \"things in America\" were \"headed in…the wrong direction\" when it came to \"whether people are able to freely express their views.\" That number dropped to 63 percent in April 2024, rose to 69 percent in July 2024, and fell in the next two surveys, reaching a low of 59 percent last January. It rose again in the latest survey, in which 62 percent of respondents were pessimistic about free speech trends, which is still lower than the peaks recorded during the Biden administration.\n\nThe survey also asked people \"how much confidence\" they had that \"Donald Trump will protect your First Amendment rights.\" By and large, it turned out, not much: Fifty-one percent had either \"no confidence at all\" or \"very little confidence,\" while 33 percent quantified their confidence as \"full\" or \"quite a lot\" and 16 percent settled on \"some.\" The no/very little confidence rating for Trump is up from 41 percent in January.\n\nIf you are inclined toward optimism, you might interpret those results as evidence that Americans are turned off by Trump's various attempts to punish people for speech that irks him, whether through deportation, regulation, litigation, criminal investigations, or executive decrees targeting disfavored lawyers and journalists. But FIRE asked the same question about California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and the results were similar: Fifty-three percent of respondents had either \"no\" or \"very little\" confidence in Newsom's commitment to First Amendment rights.\n\nThe corresponding number for Joe Biden was a bit lower in April 2024: 45 percent, compared to 47 percent for Trump at that point. The gap between Trump and Kamala Harris was slightly bigger last October: 48 percent vs. 42 percent.\n\nIn all of these cases, most people were not highly confident that politicians could be trusted to respect freedom of speech, which makes sense. If that were a safe bet, we would not need a constitutional guarantee.","summary":"Just a quarter of respondents said they favored deporting students for \"expressing pro-Palestine views.\"","url":"https://reason.com/2025/04/17/a-survey-suggests-most-americans-are-not-keen-on-trumps-speech-based-deportation-initiative/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/03/zumaamericasfortysix485755-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 20:56:55","author":"Jacob Sullum","authors":["Jacob Sullum"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.005},{"id":312253918,"title":"CCP-linked NYPD official fined $5K for soliciting  donations for Adams; NYC transportation boss dinged for campaigning for Kamala Harris: docs","text":"An NYPD official linked to the Chinese Communist Party was fined $5,000 for soliciting donations for Mayor Eric Adams — as his transportation boss was dinged for supporting Kamala Harris’ campaign on the job, officials said Thursday.\n\nThe city Conflicts of Interest Board announced the two settlements, including with Lin Gui’an, the former assistant commissioner of the now-disbanded Police Commissioner Liaison Unit.\n\nBecause the role involved “substantial policy discretion,” COIB notified Lin in March 2024 — a month after he started the gig — that he was not legally allowed to campaign for any political candidate, the settlement document shows.\n\nBut that June, the police official asked for and collected 15 donations — totaling $4,100 — for Adams’ re-election campaign, according to the document signed by Lin and released by the COIB.\n\nThe $5,000 fine was appropriate because Lin was “a high-level law enforcement officer who should be held to a high standard of compliance with the conflicts of interest law,” the COIB wrote in the legal filing.\n\nThe Post first reported on Lin’s communist party ties in September.

Harris hasn't said for sure she plans to run, and she is also speculated to be considering a run for California's governorship in 2026.Proponents of a Harris 2028 run say she ran a good campaign despite difficult headwinds in 2024. They argue she significantly narrowed the gap compared to former President Joe Biden, who faced a flurry of bad polls after his debate against Trump that eventually led to his withdrawal from the race, in only a few months.Others, however, argue that it's time for the party to embrace new leaders, and that her support for moderate Republicans, such as former Representative Liz Cheney, has cost the party among key voter groups.What to KnowA new poll from Data for Progress found that while Harris is still favored among likely Democratic primary voters, a growing number are leaning toward other candidates such as former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York or Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.It polled 745 likely voters from April 9 to April 14, 2025. Its margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.Of those, 18 percent said they would vote for Harris in the primary. Fourteen percent said they would back Buttigieg and 12 percent would vote for each Ocasio-Cortez and Booker.Buttigieg opted not to run for statewide office in Michigan, fueling speculation he's planning another go at the presidency. Ocasio-Cortez has been garnering attention with her \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour with Senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent. Booker, meanwhile, made headlines with his 25-hours speech on the floor of the Senate.Eight percent of respondents said they planned to vote for California Governor Gavin Newsom, while Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro won support from 5 percent of respondents.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker each received the backing of four percent of respondents.This was Harris' weakest showing among other polls of the 2028 primary.An Echelon Insights poll of 449 registered voters from April 10 to April 11, 2025, showed her with 28 percent support. A YouGov poll of 650 registered voters from March 30 to April 1, 2025, showed her with 25 percent. A SurveyUSA poll of 835 likely voters from February 13 to 16, 2025, showed her with 37 percent support.The poll was first reported by Zeteo, a news outlet founded by progressive commentator Medhi Hasan.What People Are SayingThe Zeteo report of the poll reads: \"Together, the poll indicates a Democratic Party that has no clear frontrunner for the 2028 nomination. Even with Harris included, no candidate holds a dominant lead – a contrast with other surveys that have shown her far ahead. And when Harris is excluded, the field opens up further, with Buttigieg, Booker, and Ocasio-Cortez emerging as three of the top choices. These results suggest that media-savvy Democrats who seize this moment to call out Trump and the MAGA agenda could put themselves in a strong position to become the next leader of the Democratic Party.\"Former Vice President Kamala Harris, speaking about her plans earlier this year while visiting sites impacted by the Los Angeles-area wildfires: \"My plans are to be in touch with my community, to be in touch with the leaders and figure out what I can do to support them...I am here and would be here regardless of the office I hold, because it is the right thing to do, which is to show up in your community and thank the folks who are on the ground.\"What Happens NextMost candidates are unlikely to jump into the race until after the 2026 midterms, but speculation will continue about who is likely to run. Harris could make a decision about whether to run in California by the end of the summer.","summary":"A new poll showed contenders like Pete Buttigieg, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cory Booker gaining ground on Harris.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-hold-2028-nomination-slipping-2061224","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2629376/vice-president-kamala-harris-2028-hold-slipping.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 19:11:53","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":312238106,"title":"Former OneRepublic bassist to take on GOP Rep. Ken Calvert in tight Riverside district","text":"By MICHAEL R. BLOOD\n\nIn the fight for the U.S. House, Democrats are hoping pop rock star power will help oust a long-serving Republican in Riverside County as the party looks to regain control of the chamber and slow President Donald Trump’s agenda.\n\nTim Myers, a Grammy-nominated former bassist for international hitmakers OneRepublic, announced Thursday he will challenge Rep. Ken Calvert in the battleground 41st District in Riverside County that stretches from Norco and Corona east to the resort haven of Palm Springs.\n\n“Ken Calvert has been in Washington for 30 years,” Myers says in a video announcing his campaign. The “status quo isn’t working.”\n\nChristian Martinez, a spokesperson for the campaign arm of House Republicans, said in a statement that “Democrat Tim Myers is everything wrong with today’s radical left: a Hollywood liberal trying to fake his way into Riverside County.”\n\nMyers grew up in Corona, most of which is in the district, but now lives in neighboring Los Angeles County.\n\nAt a time when competitive House contests are becoming scarcer nationwide, Democrats consider Calvert’s closely divided California district one of the party’s best opportunities to gain ground in the chamber, where Republicans hold a fragile 220-213 majority.\n\nWith Congress and the White House under Republican control — and Democrats facing an uphill fight to take the Senate in 2026 — the California contest will carry added importance as Democrats maneuver to retake the House to provide a counterweight to the Trump administration on issues from immigration to the environment.\n\nMyers, a prolific producer, songwriter and solo artist, is positioning himself as a change agent in a race against one of the most senior members of the House. The 40-year-old Myers said he was in second grade when Calvert, the longest-serving Republican in the state’s congressional delegation, was first elected in 1992.\n\nIn the video that appears to have been filmed in a recording studio, Myers recalls growing up a pastor’s son in Corona, on the western edge of the Southern California district. He recounts the ups-and-downs of the notoriously cutthroat music business that eventually led him to found his own record label. He now lives in the tony enclave of Hidden Hills in neighboring Los Angeles County, a popular redoubt for musicians and actors.\n\nMyers berates Trump policies that he says will hurt veterans and drive up consumer prices.\n\n“Our community is being priced out of homeownership, groceries are more expensive every week and we’re constantly under threat from wildfires and rising crime,” Myers said in a statement. “It’s time for a change.”\n\nRepublicans hold a slim registration advantage in the district — less than 2 points over Democrats — and Calvert has beat back tough challenges in the last two elections. Calvert prevailed by about a 3-point edge in 2024, the same year Trump carried the district by 6 points over Democrat Kamala Harris, the former California U.S. senator and attorney general.\n\nThe campaign arm of House Democrats has named Calvert a top target for 2026, as he was in 2024.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) are responding with boldness: They are roving across red states — and drawing big crowds — with a series of anti-Trump rallies.\n\nThe duo took Sanders' \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour \"deep into Trump territory this week,\" said The Associated Press. What's more, they are seeing the same crowds \"they got in liberal and battleground states\" earlier on the tour. A Monday rally in Boise, Idaho, drew 12,500 people in a county that has 11,902 registered Democrats. An earlier event in Salt Lake City pulled a reported 20,000 attendees. \"When it comes to standing up to Trumpism there is no such thing as a red state,\" said Sanders on X on Sunday. The events offer a \"dose of hope to progressives living in the places where they're most outnumbered,\" said the AP.\nA party looking for 'fighters'\n\nDemocratic voters are \"terrified, angry and desperate for leadership,\" said Lauren Gambino at The Guardian. They see much of their party's leadership as \"unable or unwilling to stand up to him.\" Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, both self-identified democratic socialists on the leftward edge of the party, are \"stepping in to fill the void.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

They are furious at figures like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who they perceive as \"hesitant to take on President Donald Trump and Elon Musk.\" What rank-and-file party activists want \"aren't necessarily socialists, but fighters.\" If Kamala Harris, Barack Obama or any other \"center-left Democrat with a national following\" went on tour, \"they, too, would draw big crowds.\"\n\nAttendees at the rallies are frightened that the \"country they'd always counted on\" is \"sliding away because of Trump,\" said Megan K. Stack at The New York Times. They are \"wondering how much leaner things could get\" if a recession hits. And they are alarmed as Trump and Musk upend parts of government that \"long seemed as unremarkable and permanent as boulders.\" But Sanders is saying the same things he always has. His longstanding warnings about oligarchy now seem \"prescient and thoroughly relevant.\"\n\n'A vehicle for their anger'\nIf AOC is the Democratic Party's future, the \"party is even worse off than we think,\" said Rich Lowry at the National Review. The New York congresswoman is being spoken of as a \"potential primary challenger to Schumer, and even a national leader for Democrats.\" She may be \"charismatic and adept at social media,\" but her \"woke\" politics make Ocasio-Cortez a \"cartoonish version of the Democratic Party that the GOP hopes to run against.\"\nSanders and Ocasio-Cortez are giving voters a \"place to gather, scream, and feel a little less helpless,\" said John Hendrickson at The Atlantic. Democrats lost to Trump \"because they've become the party of elites.\" The duo may point to a way back. \"What Sanders and AOC are addressing\" is that \"people want a vehicle for their anger.\"\n\nExplore More\n\nBernie Sanders\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez\n\nDonald Trump\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nJoel Mathis, The Week US\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nJoel Mathis is a writer with 30 years of newspaper and online journalism experience.

Biden confused Iraq with Ukraine, with a former aide correcting him, and later dropped an ice cream bar.Why It MattersBiden was forced to abandon his bid for reelection following a series of gaffes and a poor presidential debate against President Donald Trump in June 2024.The White House has withheld federal money from several universities to pressure institutions to comply with Trump's political agenda. The president this week denied Harvard $2.2 billion in funding and $60 million in contracts and the college has vowed it will \"not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights\" to the federal government.A Harvard spokesperson told The Harvard Crimson that Biden and Harvard President Alan Garber did not meet on Wednesday.What To KnowBiden reportedly attended the small, private event at Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) as part of an Institute of Politics (IOP) seminar in which he celebrated the university's response to Trump's demands, according to The Harvard Crimson.The publication reported that select HKS students were invited to the study group, but were previously unaware what the event entailed or who would be speaking.\"Harvard stepped up in a way no one else has,\" Biden reportedly said, according to two students who attended the event. \"You should be really thankful.\"During the afternoon event attended by some 50 students, Biden, 82, reportedly confused Ukraine and Iraq when discussing the continuing war in Eastern Europe. He was corrected by former White House senior adviser Mike Donilon, who is currently a spring resident fellow at IOP and worked on Biden's reelection campaign.Another scene reportedly involved Biden biting into a melting ice cream bar, only for the dessert to fall to the floor.Biden's four years in office were marred with gaffes that resulted in some scrutiny regarding his mental fitness and ability to serve a second term.His words and behavior drew constant criticism from Republicans who questioned his mental acuity. Gaffes like falling up the stairs of Air Force One and reading teleprompter instructions aloud became conservative fodder that escalated as the years progressed.Perhaps nothing drew widespread attention than Biden's debate performance with Donald Trump in June 2024, which included the Democrat trailing off during responses.It almost instantly resulted in calls from prominent Democrats and donors for the then-sitting president to bow out of his campaign and provide another candidate with the time and financial resources to potentially defeat Trump.He ultimately stepped aside from his reelection campaign in 2024, allowing former Vice President Kamala Harris to eventually take the reins as the Democratic Party nominee.What People Are SayingFormer President Barack Obama wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Monday: \"Harvard has set an example for other higher-ed institutions—rejecting an unlawful and ham-handed attempt to stifle academic freedom, while taking concrete steps to make sure all students at Harvard can benefit from an environment of intellectual inquiry, rigorous debate and mutual respect. Let's hope other institutions follow suit.\"Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik of New York posted to X on Monday: \"Harvard University has rightfully earned its place as the epitome of the moral and academic rot in higher education. Fueled by the radical groupthink Far Left faculty, inept University leadership, donations by foreign adversaries, and pro-Hamas terrorists, Harvard has fully embraced and tolerated the raging antisemitism threatening the lives and physical safety of Jewish students on campus.What Happens NextOn Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) terminated nearly $3 million in grants to Harvard University.

Josh Shapiro to a Passover Seder, held in the same room at the governor’s official residence that was devastated by an arsonist just hours after Shapiro hosted this year’s Jewish holiday feast.\n\nNow, as she looks at photos of the destruction, Zawatsky can envision where she had been seated and how deadly the attack could have been.\n\nLike many others, Zawatsky is cautiously awaiting word from investigators about the motivations of the attacker, which are clouded by hints of erratic behavior as well as statements from his past. \n\nStill, the attack hit the Jewish community hard in a state where such pain is achingly familiar. It targeted Pennsylvania’s religiously observant Jewish governor in the very place where just hours before he had hosted one of the central rituals of the Jewish calendar.\n\nZawatsky heads a Pittsburgh organization formed to counter antisemitism and memorialize the victims of another Pennsylvania assault – the murders of 11 worshippers from three congregations at the Tree of Life synagogue more than six years ago, the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.\n\n“Seeing those images is deeply traumatic,” said Zawatsky, CEO of The Tree of Life, the group established in the wake of the Oct. 27, 2018 killings. “It’s not too much to ask that we all live in a country where we celebrate our faith without fear.” \n\n A murkier picture emerges on motive \n\nThe synagogue shooting trial revealed that the gunman, who was convicted and sentenced to death, had long been steeped in antisemitism and methodically carried out the attack.\n\nIn the Harrisburg case, things are less clear. Investigators have released only fragments of what the suspect, Cody Balmer, of Harrisburg, told them. His relatives say he has struggled with mental illness, and his lawyers suggested Wednesday that will be central to their defense. \n\n“We have no definitive information about this person’s motive,\" Zawatsky said. \"We do know that there was certainly hate involved.”\n\nPennsylvania State Police said the 38-year-old Balmer confessed to the attack, harbored hatred for the governor and said he planned to beat Shapiro with a hammer. \n\n“BALMER identified himself by name and related that Governor Josh SHAPIRO needs to know that he ‘...will not take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people,’” police wrote as part of applications for search warrants. Exactly who and what that meant were unclear in the documents.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York on Thursday called on the Justice Department to determine whether the attack qualifies as a federal hate crime.\n\nAudrey Glickman, a survivor of the 2018 attack and a member of Tree of Life Congregation, said she admired Shapiro’s composure, just hours after the attack, and his emphatic denunciation of hatred regardless of motivation.\n\n“It takes a while to realize you’ve been attacked and what to make of it,” Glickman said. She admired “how he stood up right away and spoke strongly about it.”\n\nShapiro responded to the scene of the 2018 Pittsburgh attack as Pennsylvania’s then-attorney general. As governor, he took part in the 2024 groundbreaking for a new building to replace the synagogue, including a memorial, programming and other exhibits aimed to counter antisemitism.\n\n Reminders of an overheated political climate \n\nAbout 200 people participated in a somber march Wednesday night in Harrisburg. They walked from the parking lot of a synagogue to the governor's residence, where they held a multifaith prayer vigil across the street.\n\nSeveral marchers connected the attack to the overheated political climate.\n\n“To deny it is like putting your head in the sand,” said retired Presbyterian minister Don Potter, 75, of Dillsburg, who said the images of the building’s interior with fire damage “made me sick.”\n\nEnid Wassner, a retired child care worker from Hershey, said the fact that the firebombing occurring during Passover and targeted Shapiro and his family was “extremely worrying.” She noted that Jewish institutions and buildings in Harrisburg have had to increase security.\n\n“Gradually things have been getting more worrisome, for me personally and the entire Jewish community.\"\n\n Questions emerge about attacker's mental state \n\nPolice said in court affidavits that in an interview with detectives Balmer “admitted to harboring hatred towards” Shapiro and referred to the Palestinian people in a 911 call attributed to him that was placed shortly after the break-in. \n\nBalmer’s mother and brother have said he suffered from bipolar disorder and would not consistently take medication. His brother, Dan Balmer, said Cody Balmer twice in recent years spent time in a psychiatric hospital in Harrisburg. During a court hearing on Monday, Balmer denied any history of mental illness. \n\nDan Balmer told the AP on Tuesday that Cody Balmer “had these theories that were going on in his head” and became angry when family members would tell him his views didn't reflect reality.\n\n“The allegations, if true, demonstrate the devastating consequences of severe mental illness,” Mary Klatt, the chief public defender in Dauphin County, whose office is representing Balmer, said Wednesday. She said his preliminary hearing would be delayed to determine whether Balmer is mentally competent to stand trial. \n\n Identity moves to forefront for Shapiro \n\nShapiro declined to talk about the attacker's motive on Wednesday, saying prosecutors will ultimately determine what drove him. \n\n“It’s not for me to answer that,” he said.\n\nThe governor has publicly criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government and the nature of Israel’s military action in Gaza, but also has backed Israel’s right to defend itself from Hamas.\n\nHank Butler, executive director of the Pennsylvania Jewish Coalition, said Shapiro’s focus has been Pennsylvania and not the Palestinian people.\n\n“To say that our governor wishes the worst on the Palestinian people is not welcomed here,” Butler said. “It is not justified, absolutely not justified -- no attack is justified.”\n\nShapiro has won statewide races three times in a crucial battleground state. He was a finalist to be Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate in last year's presidential campaign and is considered a potential 2028 Democratic candidate for president. \n\nThe attack once again puts his identity front and center. When Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz over Shapiro, Republicans tried to cast the pick as a snub to Jewish voters. \n\nRabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, an umbrella group for more than 800 Reform congregations in North America, connected the attack to Shapiro's identity.\n\n“He’s also someone who is a strong supporter of Israel,” Jacobs said of Shapiro. \"Are those things that put your life at risk in the 21st century?”\n\nZawatsky, the Tree of Life CEO, noted that in the Passover ritual, Jews are instructed not just to recite the story of their ancient forebears’ liberation from slavery but to envision themselves as having experienced it – something that feels especially poignant now. Whether law enforcement officials ultimately settle on a definitive conclusion about what motivated last weekend's attack, she and others already know what living in fear feels like.\n\n“It’s very sad to think we pass along the inherited trauma of the fear of antisemitism, but never did I think we would be a generation that would have the lived experience of this kind of violent antisemitism,” she said.\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

BLOOD\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — In the fight for the U.S. House, Democrats are hoping pop rock star power will help oust a long-serving Republican east of Los Angeles as the party looks to regain control of the chamber and slow President Donald Trump’s agenda.\n\nTim Myers, a Grammy-nominated former bassist for international hitmakers OneRepublic, announced Thursday he will challenge Rep. Ken Calvert in the battleground 41st District in Riverside County that stretches from the L.A. suburbs to the resort haven of Palm Springs.\n\n“Ken Calvert has been in Washington for 30 years,” Myers says in a video announcing his campaign. The “status quo isn’t working.”\n\nChristian Martinez, a spokesperson for the campaign arm of House Republicans, said in a statement that “Democrat Tim Myers is everything wrong with today’s radical left: a Hollywood liberal trying to fake his way into Riverside County.”\n\nMyers grew up in Corona, most of which is in the district, but now lives in neighboring Los Angeles County.\n\nAt a time when competitive House contests are becoming scarcer nationwide, Democrats consider Calvert’s closely divided California district one of the party’s best opportunities to gain ground in the chamber, where Republicans hold a fragile 220-213 majority.\n\nWith Congress and the White House under Republican control — and Democrats facing an uphill fight to take the Senate in 2026 — the California contest will carry added importance as Democrats maneuver to retake the House to provide a counterweight to the Trump administration on issues from immigration to the environment.\n\nMyers, a prolific producer, songwriter and solo artist, is positioning himself as a change agent in a race against one of the most senior members of the House. The 40-year-old Myers said he was in second grade when Calvert, the longest-serving Republican in the state’s congressional delegation, was first elected in 1992.\n\nIn the video that appears to have been filmed in a recording studio, Myers recalls growing up a pastor’s son in Corona, on the western edge of the Southern California district. He recounts the ups-and-downs of the notoriously cutthroat music business that eventually led him to found his own record label. He now lives in the tony enclave of Hidden Hills in neighboring Los Angeles County, a popular redoubt for musicians and actors.\n\nMyers berates Trump policies that he says will hurt veterans and drive up consumer prices.\n\n“Our community is being priced out of homeownership, groceries are more expensive every week and we’re constantly under threat from wildfires and rising crime,” Myers said in a statement. “It’s time for a change.”\n\nRepublicans hold a slim registration advantage in the district — less than 2 points over Democrats — and Calvert has beat back tough challenges in the last two elections. Calvert prevailed by about a 3-point edge in 2024, the same year Trump carried the district by 6 points over Democrat Kamala Harris, the former California U.S. senator and attorney general.\n\nThe campaign arm of House Democrats has named Calvert a top target for 2026, as he was in 2024. Calvert’s campaign raised over $1.3 million the first quarter of 2025.\n\nCalifornia is known as a liberal protectorate. Democrats hold every statewide office, dominate the Legislature and congressional delegation and outnumber registered Republicans by a staggering 2-1 ratio. Still, Republicans retain pockets of political clout in the Southern California suburbs and vast rural stretches, including the Central Valley farm belt.\n\nIn 2024, a tough year for Democrats nationally, the party picked up three GOP-held House seats in California.","summary":"Myers grew up in Corona, but now lives in neighboring Los Angeles County.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/04/17/onerepublic-tim-myers-house-run/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Election_2026_-House_-_California_64220.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 17:48:37","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.309},{"id":312227780,"title":"Mark Cuban Optimistic New Trump Order Could Save 'Hundreds of Billions'","text":"Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban, who emerged as a high-profile supporter of Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential campaign and a vocal critic of Donald Trump, is now praising the president's executive order aimed at curbing prescription drug costs.In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Cuban described the measure as \"a potential game-changer,\" estimating that it could \"save hundreds of billions\" by curbing the power of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), the often-opaque intermediaries in the pharmaceutical supply chain.Why It MattersThe praise marks a sharp turn for Cuban, who spent much of the 2024 election cycle criticizing Trump and billionaire backer Elon Musk while campaigning for Harris.However, the issue of high prescription costs has long been a personal crusade for Cuban, who launched his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, in 2022 to tackle inflated prices through direct-to-consumer transparency.The online pharmacy, launched in 2022, sells more than 2,500 medications with transparent pricing and a fixed 15 percent markup.What To KnowCuban's support for Trump's order centers on reforming how drug formularies are managed and increasing access to pricing data. He criticized the rebate-driven model used by PBMs, which he says inflates prices while squeezing out independent pharmacies.\"Gotta be honest. The @realDonaldTrump EO on healthcare and in particular, drug pricing could save hundreds of billions,\" the Dallas Mavericks minority owner wrote in a long post on X, before outlining six specific reforms he believes would transform the pharmaceutical system.\"Put me in coach! I'm here to help,\" Cuban wrote.Cuban listed several reforms aimed at lowering drug prices and reining in the power of PBMs, including removing them from formulary decisions to avoid financial conflicts of interest. He also called for requiring them to share claims data with employers, states and drugmakers.He pushed to end inflated pricing for so-called specialty drugs and to ensure independent pharmacies are fully reimbursed, arguing they're often penalized by pricing plans that make generics more expensive.Cuban also wants to eliminate confidentiality clauses that prevent employers from negotiating directly with drug manufacturers. Additionally, he called for banning PBMs from replacing cheaper medications with more expensive, self-branded alternatives.He noted that drugmakers currently pay 5 percent to 10 percent of a drug's retail price just to access essential data.

BLOOD | Associated Press\n\nLOS ANGELES — In the fight for the U.S. House, Democrats are hoping pop rock star power will help oust a long-serving Republican east of Los Angeles as the party looks to regain control of the chamber and slow President Donald Trump’s agenda.\n\nTim Myers, a Grammy-nominated former bassist for international hitmakers OneRepublic, announced Thursday he will challenge Rep. Ken Calvert in the battleground 41st District in Riverside County that stretches from the L.A. suburbs to the resort haven of Palm Springs.\n\n“Ken Calvert has been in Washington for 30 years,” Myers says in a video announcing his campaign. The “status quo isn’t working.”\n\nChristian Martinez, a spokesperson for the campaign arm of House Republicans, said in a statement that “Democrat Tim Myers is everything wrong with today’s radical left: a Hollywood liberal trying to fake his way into Riverside County.”\n\nMyers grew up in Corona, most of which is in the district, but now lives in neighboring Los Angeles County.\n\nAt a time when competitive House contests are becoming scarcer nationwide, Democrats consider Calvert’s closely divided California district one of the party’s best opportunities to gain ground in the chamber, where Republicans hold a fragile 220-213 majority.\n\nWith Congress and the White House under Republican control — and Democrats facing an uphill fight to take the Senate in 2026 — the California contest will carry added importance as Democrats maneuver to retake the House to provide a counterweight to the Trump administration on issues from immigration to the environment.\n\nMyers, a prolific producer, songwriter and solo artist, is positioning himself as a change agent in a race against one of the most senior members of the House. The 40-year-old Myers said he was in second grade when Calvert, the longest-serving Republican in the state’s congressional delegation, was first elected in 1992.\n\nIn the video that appears to have been filmed in a recording studio, Myers recalls growing up a pastor’s son in Corona, on the western edge of the Southern California district. He recounts the ups-and-downs of the notoriously cutthroat music business that eventually led him to found his own record label. He now lives in the tony enclave of Hidden Hills in neighboring Los Angeles County, a popular redoubt for musicians and actors.\n\nMyers berates Trump policies that he says will hurt veterans and drive up consumer prices.\n\n“Our community is being priced out of homeownership, groceries are more expensive every week and we’re constantly under threat from wildfires and rising crime,” Myers said in a statement. “It’s time for a change.”\n\nRepublicans hold a slim registration advantage in the district — less than 2 points over Democrats — and Calvert has beat back tough challenges in the last two elections. Calvert prevailed by about a 3-point edge in 2024, the same year Trump carried the district by 6 points over Democrat Kamala Harris, the former California U.S. senator and attorney general.\n\nThe campaign arm of House Democrats has named Calvert a top target for 2026, as he was in 2024. Calvert’s campaign raised over $1.3 million the first quarter of 2025.\n\nCalifornia is known as a liberal protectorate. Democrats hold every statewide office, dominate the Legislature and congressional delegation and outnumber registered Republicans by a staggering 2-1 ratio. Still, Republicans retain pockets of political clout in the Southern California suburbs and vast rural stretches, including the Central Valley farm belt.\n\nIn 2024, a tough year for Democrats nationally, the party picked up three GOP-held House seats in California.","summary":"In the fight for the U.S. House, Democrats are hoping pop rock star power will help oust a long-serving Republican east of Los Angeles as the party looks to regain control of the chamber and slow President Donald Trump’s agenda.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/04/17/former-bassist-for-pop-rockers-onerepublic-to-take-on-veteran-california-gop-house-member/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Election_2026_-House_-_California_64220.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 17:33:09","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.29},{"id":312234900,"title":"Nate Silver: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Most Likely 2028 Democrat Presidential Nominee","text":"Election pollster Nate Silver believes Rep.

Abdul El-Sayed, 40, is the second Democrat to put his name in the running to replace Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, who is not seeking reelection. El-Sayed, a prominent figure in a movement that was highly critical of support for Israel in the 2024 election cycle, aims to set himself apart from the other Democratic candidates in the race to replace Peters, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow. McMorrow has said she would vote against Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., retaining his leadership position should she prevail in the primary and general election to represent the battleground state in the upper chamber of Congress. However, El-Sayed held back criticism of Schumer. \"Anybody who tells you that they’re going to unilaterally oppose one potential candidate without knowing who the alternative is, is either unnuanced or unsophisticated,\" El-Sayed told Politico. \"So I want to know who is available, who is actively seeking the leadership. I’ll make a decision from there.\" GRETCHEN WHITMER RIBBED ONLINE FOR SEEMING TO HIDE FACE IN OVAL OFFICE \"What we need right now is somebody who’s willing to take the fight directly to Trump and Musk, but then also knows how to rebuild a version of our federal government that better serves working people after the carnage that Musk and Trump are going to leave behind, and I think I offer that,\" he told Politico. Other Democrats considering a run to replace Peters include U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel. El-Sayed was active in the \"uncommited movement,\" a group of anti-Israel, traditionally Democratic voters in Michigan, a critical swing state, who threatened to withhold support from then-President Joe Biden, and then then-Vice President Kamala Harris, over the administration's stance on Gaza. He did say he would back whoever was the eventual Democratic choice for the presidential ticket to oppose now-President Donald Trump, according to Politico. The Israel-Hamas war exposed deep divisions within the Democratic Party last election cycle, and there is concern the conflict could again make for a messy Senate Democratic primary in Michigan if the American Israel Public Affairs Committee intervenes. The powerful pro-Israel lobby group financially backed Stevens in 2022, when redistricting forced a competitive primary run against fellow Democrat, Rep. Andy Levin. \"Everybody is unified around leadership that reminds the Democratic Party that we ought to be the party of peace and justice, that we ought not to be the party sending bombs and money to foreign militaries to drop bombs on other people’s kids in their schools and their hospitals, when our kids need more, our hospitals and schools need more, and we should be spending that money here at home,\" El-Sayed told Politico. FIRST ON FOX: REPUBLICAN LAUNCHES SECOND STRAIGHT BID TO FLIP DEMOCRAT-HELD SENATE SEAT IN KEY BATTLEGROUND El-Sayed ran for governor in 2018 as a progressive Democrat and was endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. He came in second in the Democratic primary, losing to Gretchen Whitmer by more than 20 points and beating now-U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar by more than 12 points. Whitmer went on to win the general election and is in the midst of a second term. She cannot run again because of term limits. A resident of Ann Arbor, El-Sayed recently served as director of the Department of Health, Human and Veterans Services in Wayne County, home to Detroit. Before that, he was the public health director of the city after it declared bankruptcy in 2013. El-Sayed cautioned Democrats against learning the \"wrong lessons\" from their defeats. \"If you cut corners and trim your message, and you triangulate to the least common denominator, you can find something that’s perfectly inoffensive to everyone, and the problem with that is that you’re not actually saying anything,\" he told Politico. El-Sayed said he met with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee on Tuesday. He told Politico that it was his \"understanding\" that the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm would not get involved in the primary. If that happens, that deviates from how the DSCC previously acted to clear the field of potential primary candidates to make for an easier primary victory for then-Rep. Elissa Slotkin. Now-Sen. Slotkin, D-Mich., easily won the primary over Hill Harper, and then won the general election. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP El-Sayed is also the second candidate this week to launch a campaign to replace Peters. On the Republican side, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers launched his bid on Monday after losing the Senate race last year by 19,000 votes to Democrat Slotkin.

(AP) — A year ago, Carole Zawatsky was invited by Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro to a Passover Seder, held in the same room at the governor’s official residence that was devastated by an arsonist just hours after Shapiro hosted this year’s Jewish holiday feast.\n\nNow, as she looks at photos of the destruction, Zawatsky can envision where she had been seated and how deadly the attack could have been.\n\nLike many others, Zawatsky is cautiously awaiting word from investigators about the motivations of the attacker, which are clouded by hints of erratic behavior as well as statements from his past. \n\nStill, the attack hit the Jewish community hard in a state where such pain is achingly familiar. It targeted Pennsylvania’s religiously observant Jewish governor in the very place where just hours before he had hosted one of the central rituals of the Jewish calendar.\n\nZawatsky heads a Pittsburgh organization formed to counter antisemitism and memorialize the victims of another Pennsylvania assault – the murders of 11 worshippers from three congregations at the Tree of Life synagogue more than six years ago, the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.\n\n“Seeing those images is deeply traumatic,” said Zawatsky, CEO of The Tree of Life, the group established in the wake of the Oct. 27, 2018 killings. “It’s not too much to ask that we all live in a country where we celebrate our faith without fear.” \n\nA murkier picture emerges on motive\n\nThe synagogue shooting trial revealed that the gunman, who was convicted and sentenced to death, had long been steeped in antisemitism and methodically carried out the attack.\n\nIn the Harrisburg case, things are less clear. Investigators have released only fragments of what the suspect, Cody Balmer, of Harrisburg, told them. His relatives say he has struggled with mental illness, and his lawyers suggested Wednesday that will be central to their defense. \n\n“We have no definitive information about this person’s motive,” Zawatsky said. “We do know that there was certainly hate involved.”\n\nPennsylvania State Police said the 38-year-old Balmer confessed to the attack, harbored hatred for the governor and said he planned to beat Shapiro with a hammer. \n\n“BALMER identified himself by name and related that Governor Josh SHAPIRO needs to know that he ‘...will not take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people,’” police wrote as part of applications for search warrants. Exactly who and what that meant were unclear in the documents.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York on Thursday called on the Justice Department to determine whether the attack qualifies as a federal hate crime.\n\nAudrey Glickman, a survivor of the 2018 attack and a member of Tree of Life Congregation, said she admired Shapiro’s composure, just hours after the attack, and his emphatic denunciation of hatred regardless of motivation.\n\n“It takes a while to realize you’ve been attacked and what to make of it,” Glickman said. She admired “how he stood up right away and spoke strongly about it.”\n\nShapiro responded to the scene of the 2018 Pittsburgh attack as Pennsylvania’s then-attorney general. As governor, he took part in the 2024 groundbreaking for a new building to replace the synagogue, including a memorial, programming and other exhibits aimed to counter antisemitism.\n\nReminders of an overheated political climate\n\nAbout 200 people participated in a somber march Wednesday night in Harrisburg. They walked from the parking lot of a synagogue to the governor’s residence, where they held a multifaith prayer vigil across the street.\n\nSeveral marchers connected the attack to the overheated political climate.\n\n“To deny it is like putting your head in the sand,” said retired Presbyterian minister Don Potter, 75, of Dillsburg, who said the images of the building’s interior with fire damage “made me sick.”\n\nEnid Wassner, a retired child care worker from Hershey, said the fact that the firebombing occurring during Passover and targeted Shapiro and his family was “extremely worrying.” She noted that Jewish institutions and buildings in Harrisburg have had to increase security.\n\n“Gradually things have been getting more worrisome, for me personally and the entire Jewish community.”\n\nQuestions emerge about attacker’s mental state\n\nPolice said in court affidavits that in an interview with detectives Balmer “admitted to harboring hatred towards” Shapiro and referred to the Palestinian people in a 911 call attributed to him that was placed shortly after the break-in. \n\nBalmer’s mother and brother have said he suffered from bipolar disorder and would not consistently take medication. His brother, Dan Balmer, said Cody Balmer twice in recent years spent time in a psychiatric hospital in Harrisburg. During a court hearing on Monday, Balmer denied any history of mental illness. \n\nDan Balmer told the AP on Tuesday that Cody Balmer “had these theories that were going on in his head” and became angry when family members would tell him his views didn’t reflect reality.\n\n“The allegations, if true, demonstrate the devastating consequences of severe mental illness,” Mary Klatt, the chief public defender in Dauphin County, whose office is representing Balmer, said Wednesday. She said his preliminary hearing would be delayed to determine whether Balmer is mentally competent to stand trial. \n\nIdentity moves to forefront for Shapiro\n\nShapiro declined to talk about the attacker’s motive on Wednesday, saying prosecutors will ultimately determine what drove him. \n\n“It’s not for me to answer that,” he said.\n\nThe governor has publicly criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government and the nature of Israel’s military action in Gaza, but also has backed Israel’s right to defend itself from Hamas.\n\nHank Butler, executive director of the Pennsylvania Jewish Coalition, said Shapiro’s focus has been Pennsylvania and not the Palestinian people.\n\n“To say that our governor wishes the worst on the Palestinian people is not welcomed here,” Butler said. “It is not justified, absolutely not justified -- no attack is justified.”\n\nShapiro has won statewide races three times in a crucial battleground state. He was a finalist to be Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate in last year’s presidential campaign and is considered a potential 2028 Democratic candidate for president. \n\nThe attack once again puts his identity front and center. When Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz over Shapiro, Republicans tried to cast the pick as a snub to Jewish voters. \n\nRabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, an umbrella group for more than 800 Reform congregations in North America, connected the attack to Shapiro’s identity.\n\n“He’s also someone who is a strong supporter of Israel,” Jacobs said of Shapiro. “Are those things that put your life at risk in the 21st century?”\n\nZawatsky, the Tree of Life CEO, noted that in the Passover ritual, Jews are instructed not just to recite the story of their ancient forebears’ liberation from slavery but to envision themselves as having experienced it – something that feels especially poignant now. Whether law enforcement officials ultimately settle on a definitive conclusion about what motivated last weekend’s attack, she and others already know what living in fear feels like.\n\n“It’s very sad to think we pass along the inherited trauma of the fear of antisemitism, but never did I think we would be a generation that would have the lived experience of this kind of violent antisemitism,” she said.\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

We don’t want to experiment,” he added. \n\nHarvard government professor Steven Levitsky, co-author of How Democracies Die, had some harsh words for Stefanik back in January 2024. \n\n“Stefanik appears to be willing to go down Trump’s authoritarian path wholeheartedly. She scares me in several ways,” he told The Guardian during a period when the ultra-conservative was emerging as a strong advocate for Trump’s third presidential campaign. \n\nStefanik is a Harvard graduate who began her political career as a moderate in the GOP but has since shifted right as the MAGA movement has engulfed the party. Despite dedicating an entire section on her congressional website to her support for law enforcement, Stefanik is an avid defender of the actions of the January 6 rioters, calling them “hostages” in an interview with NBC News. \n\nStefanik is also an outspoken supporter of Israel. \n\nSpeaking at an anti-semitism address in May 2024, she said: “I was raised in Upstate New York, I attended an all-girls day school right next door to a synagogue. I grew up attending b'nai mitzvot of childhood and family friends and have been welcomed into many homes for Shabbat dinner. \n\n“I’ve celebrated with my friends the birth of their children, attending baby namings and bri-tote, and signing a ketubah at a friend’s wedding. My love and respect for the Jewish people and the people of Israel is lifelong and deep.”\n\nKathy Hochul, 66, is the current Governor of New York State, and she is set to run for a second full term in 2026. \n\nProviding Stefanik runs, she will likely face off against Lawler in a bid for Trump’s endorsement as well as the party’s nomination. \n\nLawler hinted that he would run in the 2026 election, as reported by the New York Post in December of last year.\n\nRepublican Putnam County Executive Kevin Byrne could also be vying for a seat, according to Politico.\n\nThe Independent contacted Stefanik’s office for comment.","summary":"‘Congresswoman Elise Stefanik is GREAT!!!,’ President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social Wednesday","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/elise-stefanik-trump-new-york-governer-career-b2734931.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/13/17/a10b7d49182d4a0a90994001eaef536e.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/BO73eoUm-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-17 16:07:26","author":"Madeline Sherratt","authors":["Madeline Sherratt"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.24},{"id":312182396,"title":"Election guru Nate Silver predicts Ocasio-Cortez would lead Dems in 2028: Way too early but...","text":"Election guru Nate Silver who lost much of his credibility for his 2024 election prediction has now come up with a way too early prediction for the Democratic party in the 2028 election.

I mean, look, in polls, if she were to try to primary Chuck Schumer, she is now ahead in those polls, and New York Democrats are actually a pretty moderate bloc.”Silver said she was not sure whether AOC would even mount a campaign and it's too early for a prediction three years and three months ahead but AOC has the maximum favorability rating. Both Druke and Silver picked Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro as their second-most likely nominee, with Druke going for former Vice President Kamala Harris for his third choice, while Silver went for New Jersey Senator Cory Booker.It's no wonder that George Clooney has also revealed his favorite pick for the 2028 election but it's not AOC -- it's Marryland Governor Wes Moore. What is AOC doing right now? Fighting oligarchyKamala Harris' defeat created a vacuum in the party leadership, though former president Joe Biden expressed his willingness to resume party activities. AOC emerged as the most vocal leader and Trump-Elon Musk critic as she hit the streets along with Bernie Sanders (I-Vt) to 'fight oligarchy'.

Advancing American Freedom (AAF), the conservative policy advocacy group Pence launched in 2021, sent a letter to congressional Republicans, including House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, advising Congress to \"stand firm against tax hikes.\" \"President Trump and Republicans in Congress promised to make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent and work to secure further tax cuts. Republicans should stick to their promises and not pull pages from Kamala Harris’ losing policy platform,\" AAF President Tim Chapman and Board Chairman Marc Short wrote in the letter, referring to Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is set to expire this year. WHITE HOUSE QUIETLY FLOATS MILLIONAIRE TAX HIKE PROPOSAL IN CONGRESS AS GOP LEADERS SIGNAL OPPOSITION \"The American people voted for tax cuts, not tax hikes. Advancing American Freedom calls on Republicans to swiftly renew the across-the-board tax cuts that unleashed prosperity during President Trump’s first term and deliver on the promise to make America prosperous again,\" they wrote. Pence added in a statement to Fox News Digital, \"The Trump-Pence tax cuts lowered taxes across the board – for working families and businesses large and small. The results were historic. We got America’s economy booming like never before and created more opportunity for all Americans. Republicans know that less taxes mean more jobs.\" HAWLEY URGES REPUBLICANS TO CUT TAXES FOR WORKING-CLASS VOTERS WHO 'PUT TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE' Two sources familiar with the discussions told Fox News Digital that White House aides have been quietly floating a proposal to House Republicans that would raise the tax rate for people making more than $1 million to 40%. The plan is intended to mitigate the cost of Trump's ambitious 2024 campaign promise to cut taxes on overtime pay, tipped wages and retirees' Social Security. The sources stressed the discussions were only preliminary, and the plan is one of many being discussed as congressional Republicans work on advancing Trump's \"big, beautiful bill.\" Pence responded to Fox News Digital's reporting on Wednesday, urging House Republicans to resist tax increases on the wealthy. \"Republicans Don’t Raise Taxes. Republicans Cut Taxes,\" Pence responded on X. \"Raising the Top Marginal Rate would be a Huge Tax Increase on Small Business America.\" Pence has often criticized Trump's policies during his second term, most recently critiquing Trump's tariff uncertainty, arguing even 10% tariffs would drive inflation higher and hurt American families. In a call for limited government, Pence also advocated for Congress to reclaim their authority over tariffs during remarks this week. Trump's former vice president refused to endorse him in 2024. Pence, who himself launched a short-lived 2024 presidential campaign, unexpectedly dropped out of the race for the White House during remarks at the Republican Jewish Coalition's annual event in Las Vegas in October 2023. Trump spoke on the same stage soon after Pence's announcement without acknowledging the news. However, Trump and Pence were seen shaking hands at former President Jimmy Carter's funeral in December – their first public appearance together in nearly four years. Pence congratulated Trump on winning the 2024 election, despite refusing to endorse him. Pence has distanced himself from his former boss since the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when Pence defied Trump's wishes by affirming that former President Joe Biden rightly won the 2020 election. Rioters called for Pence to be hanged, and the former vice president has faced the ire of Trump's most loyal supporters ever since. The former vice president's campaign failed to gain traction as Trump's lead over the crowded Republican Party widened, and Republican voters proved they had not forgotten Pence's \"disloyalty\" to Trump during the attacks on the U.S. Capitol. Pence ran on a traditional conservative platform, framing the future of the Republican Party against what he called the rise of \"populism\" in the party. Among the slim anti-Trump base of the Republican Party, Pence received praise for his courage on that day. As Pence campaigned in Iowa and New Hampshire, voters at town halls often thanked Pence for standing up to Trump. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Mike Pence stood for the Constitution.

When I saw people on my side of the street not telling the truth, I thought that it was time” to go public, Clooney told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Wednesday.\nTitled “I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee,” Clooney’s piece was published in July, following Biden’s catastrophic TV debate performance against Donald Trump. After witnessing Biden’s demeanor at a starry Hollywood fundraiser attended by Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand, Clooney concluded that he was no longer “the Joe ‘big F-ing deal’ Biden of 2010,” he wrote. “He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.” The actor added, “This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president.”\nThe op-ed prompted derision from both sides, with some on the left resisting calls for a new Democratic presidential candidate and others attacking Clooney for speaking out in the first place as a Hollywood celebrity. Even Trump bizarrely dunked on Clooney, calling him a “fake movie actor” for criticizing his then opponent.\n“I’m okay with that. I’m okay with criticism for where I stand,” said Clooney, who is currently starring as veteran journalist Edward R. Murrow in a Broadway adaptation of 2005’s Good Night, and Good Luck, a film he starred in, cowrote, and directed. “I defend their right to criticize me as much as I defend my right to criticize them.”\nJust less than two weeks after Clooney published his remarks, Biden did drop out of the race. “President Biden has shown what true leadership is. He’s saving democracy once again,” Clooney said in a statement to CNN at the time, also expressing support for Kamala Harris as his replacement on the ticket.\nIn line with what he wrote in his original op-ed, Clooney believes there should have been a “quick primary” involving top Democrats like Andy Beshear, the governor of Clooney’s home state of Kentucky, and Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer. “I think we have some really good governors,” Clooney told Tapper. “I think we would have sustained it, and [Harris] may have come out on top. I don’t know.”\nWhen asked to name his current favorite Democrats, Clooney said Maryland governor Wes Moore is “levitating above” the pack. He cited Moore’s response to the fatal March 2024 collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, his combat service, and his tenure at a George Soros–backed venture philanthropy organization. “He’s a proper leader,” he said. “I like him a lot. I think he could be someone we could all join in behind.”\nClooney also stressed the importance of anointing a new star Democrat. “We have to find somebody—rather soon,” he said on CNN. “It’s our job now to put together a proper team to stand up.”","summary":"He feels it was his “civic duty” to get Biden out of the race, even though Donald Trump still won: “I’m okay with criticism for where I stand.”","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/george-clooney-isnt-sorry-he-urged-dems-to-dump-biden-and-says-marylands-wes-moore-is-his-new-fave","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68010d58d6200e5279f52eff/16:9/w_4992,h_2808,c_limit/2169732980","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 15:38:19","author":"Savannah Walsh","authors":["Savannah Walsh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.048},{"id":312180050,"title":"George Clooney doubles down on controversial political stance","text":"George Clooney has refused to apologise for comments he made about Joe Biden (Picture: Cindy Ord/Getty)\n\nGeorge Clooney has doubled down on a controversial political stance that he says made ‘some people’ very angry with him, because he believes it was his ‘civic duty’.\n\nThe Hollywood actor, 63, hasn’t exactly got a reputation for controversial political opinions, but comments he made about former US President Joe Biden turned a few heads last year.\n\nDespite supporting previous Democratic candidates – including Barack Obama on two occasions, Hilary Clinton in 2016, and Biden himself in 2020 – he had less than kind words to say about Biden in 2024.\n\nClooney supported Biden in 2020 but changed his stance before the most recent election, which saw former Vice President Kamala Harris defeated by current President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a New York Times column, he called for Biden to step down: ‘I saw Biden three weeks ago at my fundraiser for him.

The move came just weeks after he co-hosted a re-election fundraiser for the then-president. The op-ed also followed Biden's frail performance against President Donald Trump in the June 27 presidential debate.\n\n \"I don't know if it was brave,\" Clooney told Tapper. \"It was a civic duty because I found that people on my side of the street — I'm a Democrat, I was a Democrat in Kentucky so I get it.

In the last four years, he’s won many of the battles he’s faced,\" Clooney wrote, adding that \"the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time,” in reference to Biden's age.\n\n Weeks after Clooney's op-ed, Biden announced on July 21 that he was dropping out of the race and gave then-Vice President Kamala Harris his support. Clooney later called the move \"selfless.\"\n\n “The person who should be applauded is the President who did the most selfless thing that anybody has done since George Washington,” Clooney told journalists at the 2024 Venice Film Festival when asked about the \"impact\" of his essay back in September.\n\n “All of the machinations that got us there, none of that’s going to be remembered, and it shouldn’t be,” he added. “What should be remembered is the selfless act of someone who did the hardest thing to do.

Here’s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: Kevin Carter via Getty Images)\n\nThere's a lot to say about AI's integration into journalism—and if you're only asking me, almost all of it would be extremely negative. Well, an engaged reader wouldn't just take my word for it, instead seeking to read widely on the subject to better inform their own opinion. My one request, if I may be so bold, is that your wider reading doesn't begin and end with asking an AI chatbot how it 'feels' about the subject.\n\nIn recent weeks, the LA Times has begun book-ending its opinion pieces with AI-generated 'Insights' (via AP News). Clicking on this dropdown tab offers information such as the supposed political alignment of the piece you've just read, a bullet point summary of the piece itself, as well as points offering \"different views on the topic.\" It's a 'both sides' approach by way of Perplexity-powered AI.\n\nInsights was first implemented on March 3, so it remains tricky to get a solid sense of the quality of this still very recent addition. Still, it's notable that some of its features, such as identifying the supposed political alignment of a piece, has so far only been applied to opinion pieces and not news.\n\nYou may like\n\nOpenAI is working on a new AI model Sam Altman says is ‘good at creative writing’ but to me it reads like a 15-year-old's journal\n\nWe need a better name for AI, or we risk talking past each other until actually intelligent AGI comes home mooing\n\nAt the very least, I appreciate the AI-generated bullet points offer some linked-out citations so you can dig deeper into its claims yourself. Mind you, that's a very journalist thing to say; how many people will investigate the quality of the included citations beyond noting the AI presents them at all? There's also arguably more to this story than mere AI bandwagon-hopping.\n\nFirst, a brief recap: AP News notes the LA Times was bought back in 2018 by Patrick Soon-Shiong, a transplant surgeon, medical researcher, and investor who has also served as the publication's executive chairman for the last seven years. Interviewed by Fox News last year, Soon-Shiong said, \"We've conflated news and opinion,\" later adding that the LA Times wants \"voices from all sides,\" before going on to say, \"If you just have the one side, it’s just going to be an echo chamber.\"\n\nPatrick Soon-Shiong talking to Bloomberg in 2020. (Image credit: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\nAs such, opinion pieces are very clearly demarcated from news, often labelled as 'editorial' or 'Voices'. Beyond that, the publication also chose not to endorse a specific presidential candidate last year—about two weeks prior to election day—despite an editorial in favour of Kamala Harris being allegedly already prepared. The Los Angeles Times's editorial editor, among other members of the editorial board, resigned in response to this decision. To put it another way, since at least last year, there appears to have been a greater push from upon high to steer the publication more centrally in the name of impartiality.\nRight so, with that context in mind, let's take a peek at the LA Times' AI-generated 'Insights' in action. In this opinion piece touching upon recent ICE detainments and deportations, Matt K. Lewis claims, \"The point was never really about deporting violent criminals. The point was a warning to anyone who wants to come to America: Don’t come here. Or, if you’re already here, get out.\"\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals\nKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nIn response, Insights offers, \"Supporters defend enhanced immigration enforcement as necessary to address a declared 'invasion' at the southern border,\" and \"Restricting birthright citizenship and refugee admissions is framed as correcting alleged exploitation of immigration loopholes, with proponents arguing these steps protect American workers and resources.\"\nWhile the opinion piece's stance is very clear, the AI-generated so-called-insight is comparatively mealy-mouthed, with phrasing like \"a declared 'invasion' at the southern border,\" leaving far too much unchallenged. While it would be far from ideal to descend into a rabbit-warren of AI-versus-human counter arguments, it feels very odd to allow AI the last word. What's most frustrating is the implied assertion that the AI's regurgitated claims are at all equally valid views to be presented alongside the opinion writer's stated, well-sourced horror at ICE's overreach.\nAs such, I fear Insights may be yet one more far from neutral, bias-reproducing AI, rather than a worthwhile tool that offers valuable context to readers. Insights notes, \"The Los Angeles Times editorial staff does not create or edit [this] content,\" so you can be sure that no pesky journalists were allowed to do their job and give the AI a stern talking to about uncritically repeating hearsay. Naturally, it would be ridiculous to hold the AI accountable for the decisions of the humans steering the ship—I just hope the course correction is swift.\n\nBest gaming PC: The top pre-built machines.\nBest gaming laptop: Great devices for mobile gaming.\n\nJess Kinghorn\n\nSocial Links Navigation\nHardware Writer\n\nJess has been writing about games for over ten years, spending the last seven working on print publications PLAY and Official PlayStation Magazine.

News distortion doesn’t cut it,” he continued. “Abrego Garcia came to America illegally from El Salvador, was validated as a member of the violent MS13 gang—a transnational criminal organization—and was denied bond by an immigration court for failure to show he would not pose a danger to others.”\n\nCarr concluded by wondering why Comcast was ignoring “these facts of obvious public interest.”\n\nHis remarks were in reaction to White House communications director Steven Cheung blasting cable news channels for not airing Wednesday’s press briefing, which featured the mother of a woman murdered by a Salvadoran gang member to blunt criticism of the administration defying a court order to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return.\n\n“SHAMEFUL that @CNN and @MSNBC refuses to take Angel Mom Patty Morin as she recounts the terrible tragedy of how an illegal killed her sweet daughter, Rachel,” Cheung fumed.\n\nThroughout the briefing, press secretary Karoline Leavitt bashed the mainstream media and Democrats for describing Abrego Garcia as a “Maryland father” while repeating the administration’s largely unsupported claim that he is an “MS-13 gang member and foreign terrorist.” \n\nShe also explicitly took a swipe at Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) for traveling to El Salvador to try to obtain information on the status and welfare of Abrego Garcia, who is currently locked up in the country’s notorious CECOT megaprison after the administration admittedly shipped him there – without due process – because of an “administrative error.” \n\n“Nothing will change the fact that Abrego Garcia will never be a Maryland father. He will never live in the United States of America again,” the press secretary exclaimed while simultaneously misstating the Supreme Court’s ruling that the administration must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s release and return.\n\n“It's appalling and sad that Senator Van Hollen and the Democrats applauding his trip to El Salvador today are incapable of having any shred of common sense or empathy for their own constituents and our citizens,” Leavitt continued.\n\nWhile the administration refuses to seek Abrego Garcia’s return and publicly accuses him of being an MS-13 “leader” and member of a “foreign terrorist organization” who is “involved in human trafficking,” the government’s attorneys have yet to make these claims in court and they haven’t been supported by any evidence presented.\n\nCarr’s direct attack on Comcast comes a day after Trump ripped into the media giant and its chairman Brian Roberts, claiming that the company was spinning off MSNBC and its cable assets because it was worried the network’s news coverage would bring legal action.\n\n“Wow! Fake News MSNBC has REALLY BAD RATINGS, in fact, not much better than the broken broadcasting disaster known as CNN. Comcast, which also has the ailing network known as NBC, is trying to stay away from lawsuits by disassociating NBC from MSNBC, but it won’t work,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Comcast, the owner of both, and it’s Chairman, Brian Roberts, are a disgrace to the integrity of Broadcasting!!!”\n\nThe president has ramped up his media attacks since returning to the White House, and has enlisted Carr as something of an attack dog in his mission to seek retribution against news organizations he feels have unfairly covered him.\n\nEarlier this week, for instance, Trump once again called for CBS to lose its license because he was upset about two segments aired on 60 Minutes, warning that the network would “pay a big price” for the broadcast. Trump, of course, is also suing the network for $20 billion over his allegations that 60 Minutes engaged in election interference for its “deceitful editing” of a Kamala Harris interview, a case that most legal experts feel is meritless. Still, due to a pending merger between CBS parent company Paramount and Skydance, a settlement with the president is in discussion.\n\nCarr has also ordered a probe into Comcast over its diversity, equity and inclusion programs. “I want to ensure that your companies are not promoting invidious forms of discrimination in violation of FCC regulations and civil rights laws,” Carr said in a letter in February.\n\nMeanwhile, as Deadline reported this week, “cable networks like MSNBC are ‘outside of the FCC’s jurisdiction with respect to news distortion’” and NBC News – which does fall under the FCC’s authority – led its Nightly News broadcast with Leavitt’s claims that Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 member, along with his family’s denials. Additionally, the FCC, by its own admission, has a very “narrow” authority over news content. \n\nAs far as this latest attack by Carr, media journalist Oliver Darcy noted that “it’s just one more example of how the Trump administration is weaponizing their powers to bully critics. That’s not free speech; it’s an attempt at censorship.”","summary":"‘Comcast outlets spent days misleading the American public—implying that Abrego Garcia was merely a law abiding U.S. citizen, just a regular ‘Maryland man.’ When the truth comes out, they ignore it,’ Brendan Carr tweeted on Wednesday night","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-fcc-nbc-kilmar-abrego-garcia-b2735137.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/13/19/51/GettyImages-2202558517.jpg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/of0vOZKZ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-17 14:17:02","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":312146782,"title":"George Clooney and Nate Silver reveal their picks for future of Democratic party and frontrunners for 2028","text":"Actor George Clooney and statistician Nate Silver have revealed who they believe will be the Democratic nominee in 2028. \n\nClooney said during an interview with CNN Wednesday that he backs Maryland Governor Wes Moore, who he hailed as a “proper leader” for his handling of the Baltimore Key Bridge collapse last year.

Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez when asked for his thoughts on their current “Fighting Oligarchy” tour by co-host Joanna Coles.\n\nRebuking Trump’s and his billionaire backers’ actions, the Democratic duo have turned out tens of thousands at rallies in recent weeks. But according to Cuomo, a moderate Democrat, the two are fomenting concerns over President Donald Trump’s norm-challenging second term.\n\n“The Democratic party is outraged at Trump,” Cuomo said, adding that the “chaos” the president has created has led to “fear” and “anger.” Of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez’s messaging, Cuomo added, “I think they capitalize on that.”\n\n“The Democratic party is in trouble, let’s be honest,” he continued, pointing to Trump’s election victory and the lack of enthusiasm for presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nWhen Coles asked whether the party had been “hijacked by cultural issues,” Cuomo was quick to disagree: “We hijacked ourselves.

Grammy-nominated Democrat Myers announced his intention to run in an Instagram video posted on Thursday morning (April 17) in which he told the story of growing up a pastor’s son in Corona, CA, “who learned how to stretch a dollar” and then “made it big” in his music career.\n\n The bassist who spent five years in OneRepublic in addition to releasing a number of solo projects, starting the record label Palladium records and writing/producing songs for acts including Aloe Blacc, Kesha, Hailee Steinfeld and Five For Fighting described his triumphs and struggles in the music industry. “I saw how the music industry took advantage of people,” he said in the clip that appeared to be filmed in a recording studio. “So I built a business that puts artists first. It reminds me a lot of what we’re seeing now.” \n\n Over video of Fox Business headlines and images of Pres. Trump, DOGE boss Elon Musk and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., he added, “the people in charge are screwing us over just to make a buck. Trump, Musk and these clowns in Washington are cutting cancer research, veterans health care and getting into trade wars, making everything we buy more expensive. All while giving billionaires another tax cut they don’t need.”\n\n Myers is planning to take on the long-serving Republican Rep. Ken Calvert, who has represented the 41st District in Riverside County, CA for three decades. The district runs from the L.A. suburbs to Palm Springs and in the video the musician said, “Ken Calvert has been in Washington for 30 years and all he’s done is make himself millions,” said over footage including a headline reading “Ethics Complaints Filed Against California GOP Rep. Ken Calvert Over Real Estate Holdings.”\n\n “The status quo isn’t working,” Myers said. “It’s how we ended up here to begin with. We need leaders who are going to stand up and say ‘enough.'”\n\n According to the Associated Press, a spokesperson for the campaign arm of the House Republicans, Christian Martinez, said in a statement that Myers is “everything wrong with today’s radical left: a Hollywood liberal trying to fake his way into Riverside County.” The story noted that Myers, 40, grew up in Corona, which is mostly in the district now, but that he lives in nearby Los Angeles County. Though most House races around the country are increasingly not competitive these days, Democrats believe that Calvert’s closely-held seat might be their best chance to pick up a win in the chamber where the GOP currently holds a thin 220-213 majority.\n\n The AP noted that with Democrats facing serious headwinds in an effort to take back the Senate in the 2026 election at a time when Republicans hold the presidency and both houses of Congress — as well as a conservative majority on the Supreme Court — the California race is extra important in their bid to slow down the Trump administration’s disruptive efforts on climate, immigration and the economy. At present, Republicans hold a less than 2% advantage over Democrats in the district Myers is targeting, which Calvert won by three points in 2024, a year that Trump carried the district by six points over Kamala Harris.\n\n Though considered a liberal bastion — where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 2-1 margin and hold every statewide office while dominating the state Legislature and congressional delegation — there are small areas in Southern California and the rural Central Valley farm belt where the GOP still holds sway.\n\n Watch Myers’ announcement video below.","summary":"The run against Ken Calvert is an attempt to regain control of the chamber in an effort to slow down Pres.

The question received over 13,000 replies! Here are some of the best comments.\n\nAt first, many people were quick to indulge in the thought experiment:\n\n1.\"Right wing news sources would be attacking Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris's character and outfits while taking shots at the First Husband. Left-wing news sources would be attacking their weak stance in the Middle East.\"\n\n—daedalus1982\n\n2.\"Student loan forgiveness would be eight years ahead of schedule. Look at how much progress Biden made in just four years. Dems put that as a high priority, and a solid decade of work could’ve made a huge difference for so many Americans. Trump’s admin is likely to delay or abandon a lot of that work.\"\n\n—grammar_oligarch\n\n3.\"The country would be less divided. And I never would have realized how many people in my life were completely disappointing.\"\n\n—lousyatgolf\n\n4.\"Women across the US would still have the right to choose what to do with their own bodies.\"\n\n—Darkogirl22\n\n5.\"I'd be preordering a Nintendo Switch 2.\"\n\n—need_a_venue\n\n6.\"Republicans would be non-stop whining about the deficit and the cost of eggs, gas, groceries, etc. It's what they always do when a Democrat is in charge, but they conveniently forget about all that the minute a Republican takes over.\"\n\n7.\"It depends. If Bernie Sanders had won the Democratic primary and not been shuttered by the DNC, I'm fairly sure we'd be on the way to a new Golden Age for the US. If Hillary Clinton had won, some nutjob Republican would've won in 2020, and we'd likely be on a similar track just a few years later.\"\n\n—bimmy2shoes\n\n8.\"We'd have a 6-3 majority liberal Supreme Court.\"\n\n9.\"For almost four years, I did not hear anything about Biden. It was very nice, the way it should have been. Every time I wake up now, there's some new BS constitutional crisis, and it's only been three months.\"\n\n—Shoddy-Area3603\n\n10.\"We wouldn't have lost so many people who died during Covid.\"\n\n\"Based off how the Democratic governor of New York handled Covid, I don't agree with this. I think the government as a whole simply didn’t handle Covid well.\"\n\n11.\"Regular people would have more money in their retirement accounts and portfolios. The US would still have economic allies.\"\n\n—Few-Frosting-4213\n\n\"Not just economic allies. Allies in general.\"\n\n—Bubbly_Hawk_5456\n\n12.\"We’d see more serious regulation of cryptocurrencies. Trump likes them because he loves a good con. The people Trump legitimizes via his presidency are the exact people I think Clinton would’ve prosecuted for fraud.\"\n\n—grammar_oligarch\n\nIt's worth noting that not everyone was on board with this thought experiment. Some people thought user SophieCruzReddit asked the wrong question entirely:\n\n13.\"We REALLY need to go all the way back to 2000. Then ask what would have happened if the Electoral College hadn't overridden the will of the people and the right-leaning Supreme Court hadn't thrown the election to the second worst president in our history.\"\n\n\"We would have avoided at least one war — quite possibly two.\"\n\n—deviltrombone\n\n14.\"I think the better question is, 'What would the country look like if the Fairness Doctrine hadn’t been abolished by the FCC in the 1980s?' With the Fairness Doctrine in place, Fox News wouldn't have launched, and half the country’s brains wouldn't get rewired into being [a series of insults BuzzFeed cannot publish].\"\n\n—Hell_Camino\n\n15.\"Still the same kick-the-can-down-the-road nonsense from our milquetoast, spineless politicians who try to sit on the fence and get upset whenever the select few progressives shake things up. But at least we'd still have some stability, some legal protections, and some reasonable leverage in the world.\"\n\n16.\"It’s very concerning that a lot of people think the issues we’re facing today are unique to Trump. He's just a symptom of the issue; there will be many, many more like him because that is what this system produces. Fascism is growing everywhere, selfishness and greed are on the rise, the billionaire class thinks they’re untouchable, war crimes and crimes against humanity are still happening, and poverty and corruption are rampant. Trump just pulled back the curtain so people can see what’s actually going on.\"\n\nOthers didn't think the thought experiment was appropriate, given how many lives are being threatened at this very moment:\n\n17.\"They’re disappearing people off the streets without due process. Like WTF is this question?\"\n\n\"A few weeks ago, a friend of mine with Japanese heritage was stopped by ICE in broad daylight in NYC. She was like, 'WTF, I was born here.' They asked to see her ID. Absolutely insane.\"\n\n\"The Obama administration also took people off the streets without due process during the Occupy Wall Street protests. This isn't a new or different occurrence, other than who is behind it.\"\n\nUltimately, most people seemed to agree with this final point:\n\n18.\"Remember when the biggest criticism of Biden was that he was boring? Imagine if one of the worst criticisms the US had to deal with was a lack of drama.\"\n\n—dvasquez93\n\nH/T r/AskReddit\n\nSome replies have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHow do you think the US would be different today if Trump was never president?

According to polling, his chaotic trade policy has hammered trust in his economic stewardship, his economic approval ratings are tanking, and his overall popularity continues to slide.\nThe public’s perception that Trump has been unable to lower prices or slow down inflation is at the heart of that negative trajectory — and expectations that tariffs will only raise prices and hurt the national economy may only be accelerating that decline.\nWe’re getting more information on what effect this unpopularity is having on the country’s political landscape. Is it also dragging down his party’s standing with the multiracial coalition of voters they won over in 2024? And is that discontent causing those voters, particularly young voters and voters of color, to desert him?\nWe now have some more data to help us discern the answer. Trump’s economic approval and overall ratings have fallen: They’ve slid by 7 points since early March and by 6 points since early February, respectively.\nBut the Republican Party has now mostly erased an important Democratic advantage: When Quinnipiac University asked voters recently which party cares more for “the needs and problems of people like you,” Republicans and Democrats were effectively tied. That’s a major break from history. For most of the last 20 years, Democrats have led on this question by double digits.\nWhat does this have to do with tariffs? And is this closed gap the result of something Trump — and Republicans — are doing right? Or is it something Democrats are messing up? The data paints a nuanced picture. While there are warning signs for Trump that tariffs might worsen his party’s standing with the public in general, there are also hints of resilient trust despite the chaos. Many still see Trump and the GOP as being the party better fitted to advocate for the working class. There’s also encouraging news for Democrats seeking to capitalize on the public’s economic discontent — and a warning for just how poor their standing with the electorate remains.\nHere are three ways to view this data; together, they show the complexity of this moment.\nApproach 1: Resilient trust in Trump\nCampaigns, and how their winner ran their race, matter. Trump spent much of the 2024 cycle casting himself as the change candidate who would be able to get inflation under control, boost economic growth, and, specifically, return manufacturing jobs to the US. That pledge was what many post-election surveys of voters suggest got him elected.\nAnd, it appears, a good number of Americans who voted for Trump still trust that he is trying to make good on that, or are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.\nThe overwhelming majority of Republicans still approve of Trump — 86 percent, according to Quinnipiac’s poll — while nearly 4 in 10 independents continue to support his job performance. That’s not too far off from the levels of support Trump got in November (he split independents’ votes evenly with Kamala Harris). That small difference in Republican and independent support from November to today suggests drastic defections aren’t happening yet.\nAt the same time, the full effects of his tariff and trade policy haven’t been felt yet. As tumultuous as the stock market’s performance has been over the last few weeks, it’s not the public’s top concern at this point: Just 17 percent of respondents say that the Dow’s performance is their top economic issue, compared to 47 percent who say so about the price of food and goods or the 20 percent who cite the cost of housing and rent. \nAnd most importantly, there’s a mixed set of opinions on the effect of tariffs. In the short term, the Quinnipiac survey finds, voters overwhelmingly think that Trump’s tariffs will have a negative impact on the national economy.\nBut in the long term, opinions are more evenly split on the tariffs’ effects: 41 percent of voters think they’ll help the economy, compared to 53 percent who think they will hurt.\nComparing how Republicans and independents feel about tariffs in the short versus long term suggests that a good number of voters are buying Trump and his allies’ case for tariffs. \nRepublicans, for example, are split nearly evenly on whether tariffs will help or hurt in the short term. But they overwhelmingly think they will help in the long run. A similar dynamic is at play with independents: The share who think tariffs will help in the long run (35 percent) is nearly twice as large as the share who think they will help in the short term (19 percent).\nStill, these opinions may change drastically if the economic fallout of an all-out trade war with China, sinking stocks, and a perplexing bond market ends up unfolding.\nApproach 2: Trump-specific blame is distinct from the GOP brand\nBut what do “Trump’s tariffs” mean for the rest of the Republican Party?\nThe polling suggests that the public might be differentiating between Trump and his party. That is to say, blaming the president for economic conditions and unpopular policy decisions, while viewing the Republican Party’s brand much more positively, independent of what Trump is up to.\nOne of the side effects of Trump’s campaigning and 2024 victory was to help solidify the Republican Party’s association with the working class — and to hold the overwhelming support of non-college-educated voters since 2016.\nThe Quinnipiac poll asks about the Republican Party’s brand, and traditionally the question has been taken to represent which party is benefiting from populist, everyday citizen support — in other words, who has the support of the working-class majority of America?\nCNN’s Harry Enten, who first flagged this shift in sentiment, contextualizes this through a breakdown in the Democratic vs Republican margin of support in polling from voters with and without college degrees. Since 2017, Democrats’ support among the non-college-educated voters has reversed. They went from having a seven-point advantage over the GOP to a 9-point deficit. Meanwhile, their support among college-educated voters has remained a steady 18-point edge.\nAnd despite Trump’s overall unpopularity and falling support on a range of policy issues, on the generic congressional ballot, both parties are essentially tied. According to Enten’s analysis, Congressional Democrats currently hold a 1-point advantage in national polling, compared to a tied environment in November 2024, and a 7-point advantage at this point in 2017.\nTrump’s unpopularity may continue to trickle down to the congressional and state level, but for now, voters seem to be thinking differently about Trump versus the two major parties.\nApproach 3: Democrats have fumbled the ball\nThese Republican improvements also suggest Democratic failures, specifically with their branding with these voters. Digging into the polling again brings forth some other noteworthy dynamics: The tie in who the public sees as the party that better represents their interests is actually a three-way split. Thirty-three percent of voters say it’s the GOP, 33 percent say it’s the Democrats, and 31 percent say neither party. That 31 percent is primarily made up of disaffected independents (46 percent of independents feel like neither party represents them).\nBut there’s a significant share of self-identified Democrats who feel that way too: 22 percent, probably due to the party’s base feeling disillusioned and angry at their own party leaders for not doing more to resist or stand up to Trump and the GOP.\nContributing to this Democratic dissatisfaction is the party’s jumbled response to Trump’s tariffs and the week of chaotic developments. Elected Democrats found themselves scrambled as they tried to come up with a unified countermessage: Some endorsed tariffs, some criticized Trump for imposing tariffs on allies, some criticized Republicans for profiting off the stock market chaos, and some just remained silent.\nChief among the reasons for this splintering was the fact that the party is still trying to figure out how to reclaim the mantle of fighting for the working class, how to respond to Trump’s pitch on manufacturing jobs and protectionism, and how much to repudiate their neoliberal, free trade identity since the 1990s.\nSo while Trump is crashing his popularity and potentially stands to take down the Republican Party ahead of midterms, there’s not much Democrats are doing yet to take advantage of that spiral.\nThere’s still more to come\nAs Democrats figure out how and what to say to eventually exploit Trump’s spiral, they have some breathing room. Their gamble of letting Trump and the GOP take themselves down seems to be paying off: Trump is recording even more negative marks on the economy and trade with every passing week. The latest CBS/YouGov tracking poll found Trump’s approval reaching a new low for his second term: He’s 6 points underwater, a steady slide since early February. And more than half the nation thinks the economy is getting worse, up 11 points from November 2024.\nSo Democrats have some reason for hope. The president’s sliding popularity suggests that his Biden-era gains among economic-focused voters may be short-lived.\nAnother high-quality poll, from Echelon Insights, found signs that congressional Democrats are making progress on other economic issues. Republicans have traditionally enjoyed a large advantage among voters asked which party can be trusted with “jobs and the economy” or “inflation and the cost of living.” Now, the GOP and Democrats are essentially tied.","summary":"Nearly two weeks since his “Liberation Day” tariff announcements, President Donald Trump has roundly lost the majority of the American public’s support.

Ken Calvert in the battleground 41st District in Riverside County that stretches from the L.A. suburbs to the resort haven of Palm Springs.\n\n“Ken Calvert has been in Washington for 30 years,” Myers says in a video announcing his campaign. The “status quo isn't working.”\n\nChristian Martinez, a spokesperson for the campaign arm of House Republicans, said in a statement that “Democrat Tim Myers is everything wrong with today’s radical left: a Hollywood liberal trying to fake his way into Riverside County.\"\n\nMyers grew up in Corona, most of which is in the district, but now lives in neighboring Los Angeles County. \n\nAt a time when competitive House contests are becoming scarcer nationwide, Democrats consider Calvert's closely divided California district one of the party’s best opportunities to gain ground in the chamber, where Republicans hold a fragile 220-213 majority.\n\nWith Congress and the White House under Republican control — and Democrats facing an uphill fight to take the Senate in 2026 — the California contest will carry added importance as Democrats maneuver to retake the House to provide a counterweight to the Trump administration on issues from immigration to the environment.\n\nMyers, a prolific producer, songwriter and solo artist, is positioning himself as a change agent in a race against one of the most senior members of the House. The 40-year-old Myers said he was in second grade when Calvert, the longest-serving Republican in the state’s congressional delegation, was first elected in 1992.\n\nIn the video that appears to have been filmed in a recording studio, Myers recalls growing up a pastor's son in Corona, on the western edge of the Southern California district. He recounts the ups-and-downs of the notoriously cutthroat music business that eventually led him to found his own record label. He now lives in the tony enclave of Hidden Hills in neighboring Los Angeles County, a popular redoubt for musicians and actors.\n\nMyers berates Trump policies that he says will hurt veterans and drive up consumer prices. \n\n“Our community is being priced out of homeownership, groceries are more expensive every week and we’re constantly under threat from wildfires and rising crime,” Myers said in a statement. “It’s time for a change.”\n\nRepublicans hold a slim registration advantage in the district — less than 2 points over Democrats — and Calvert has beat back tough challenges in the last two elections. Calvert prevailed by about a 3-point edge in 2024, the same year Trump carried the district by 6 points over Democrat Kamala Harris, the former California U.S. senator and attorney general.\n\nThe campaign arm of House Democrats has named Calvert a top target for 2026, as he was in 2024. Calvert's campaign raised over $1.3 million the first quarter of 2025.\n\nCalifornia is known as a liberal protectorate. Democrats hold every statewide office, dominate the Legislature and congressional delegation and outnumber registered Republicans by a staggering 2-1 ratio. Still, Republicans retain pockets of political clout in the Southern California suburbs and vast rural stretches, including the Central Valley farm belt.\n\nIn 2024, a tough year for Democrats nationally, the party picked up three GOP-held House seats in California.","summary":"Democrats are hoping pop rock star power will help oust a long-serving Republican east of Los Angeles in the fight for the U.S. House","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/former-bassist-pop-rockers-onerepublic-veteran-california-gop-120897739","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/581ed26b-2972-4e90-b3fe-8af4203ceacc/wirestory_217581b5ea742594d289b8f71a8b544f_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 10:29:10","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.317},{"id":312124266,"title":"Barabak: The fight over Trump's legal bullying campaign makes for odd alliances","text":"Lawfare makes for strange bedfellows. As part of his tightening grip on power, and his assault on 200-plus years of checks and balances, President Trump has bludgeoned some of the nation’s leading law firms into shameful submission, extracting hundreds of millions of dollars worth of free legal work for his pet causes. More significantly, the vengeful felon-in-chief has sent a clear-cut message: Oppose his heedless, plainly unconstitutional actions in court — one of the only avenues left to fight Trump's creeping authoritarianism — and there will be a dear price to pay. Given that choice — between principle and profits — many high-powered litigators have collapsed like a cheap umbrella. But not all. Last week, the L.A.-based law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson filed a federal court brief denouncing Trump's targeting of Perkins Coie — which numbered Hillary Clinton among past clients — and other legal firms facing wrongful retribution for, among other things, holding the Jan. 6 rioters to account. Trump's actions \"pose a grave threat to our system of constitutional governance and to the rule of law itself,\" the firm said in its brief. \"The looming threat ... is not lost on anyone practicing law in this country today: any controversial representation challenging actions of the current administration (or even causes it disfavors) now brings with it the risk of devastating retaliation.\" The ranks of Munger, Tolles used to include one Usha Vance, who resigned in the summer after her husband, JD, was chosen as Trump's vice presidential running mate and avenging mini-me. Small world. The political views of America's second lady are something of a well-kept mystery. Though she clerked for the conservative Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and the even-more conservative Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh before his ascension to the Supreme Court, Vance was a registered Democrat until at least 2014. By signing on with Munger, Tolles, the Yale Law School graduate embraced a firm that describes its corporate culture as “radically progressive.\" Its reputation is no secret. In a 2019 column, the American Lawyer called Munger, Tolles “a top contender in the cool, woke category” — which is about as far removed from the Trump World groove as it gets. Kind of like a drag queen showing up at a MAGA picnic. It's impossible to know what's going on inside Vance's head as she finds her old law firm so fiercely at odds with her new political peer group. But there was a definite hostage-video vibe to her appearances during the presidential campaign, giving students of body language a speculative field day. Also worth noting: The second lady's mom is a UC San Diego provost and big promoter of diversity, equity and inclusion — which Trump regards with the enmity other presidents once reserved for Al Qaeda and the former Soviet Union. Who wouldn't love to be a fly on the wall when the extended Vance family gets together? As it happens, the nation's former second gentleman, as Doug Emhoff was known, is also crossways with his legal firm. Kamala Harris' spouse, a longtime entertainment, media and intellectual property attorney in Los Angeles, joined the white-shoe law firm of Willkie Farr & Gallagher after the former vice president left the White House. This month, Willkie Farr caved to Trump's intimidation campaign, agreeing to provide at least $100 million in pro bono legal work during Trump’s presidency and beyond. The firm's services will be dedicated to helping veterans, Gold Star families, law enforcement offices and first responders — all unarguably meritorious individuals deserving of support. Still, blackmail is no way to enlist the firm's good counsel. By coincidence, Emhoff spoke to Georgetown Law School students shortly before a preening Trump announced Willkie Farr's surrender on social media. “The rule of law is under attack. Democracy is under attack,\" Emhoff said. \"And so, all of us lawyers need to do what we can to push back on that. Us lawyers have always been on the front lines, fighting for civil rights, for justice. ... I love being a lawyer, this is what we do: We fight for people. We fight for what’s right.” Emhoff subsequently made known his unhappiness with the firm's capitulation, though he's stopped short of quitting — as some have urged — to protest its bended knee. \"I disagree with the decision that my firm made to settle — I do,\" he said at a recent Los Angeles fundraiser for Bet Tzedek, a legal aid organization Emhoff has supported for more than 30 years. \"I wanted them to fight a patently unconstitutional potential executive order. \"Our legal system depends on the willingness of institutions — law firms, clients — to stand firm, and stand together,\" he went on. \"They need to do that in the face of pressure and we need to do it to defend the principles that define our democracy. \"At this very critical moment, I urge my colleagues across the legal profession to remain vigilant, engaged and unafraid to challenge actions that may erode our fundamental rights.\" Emhoff's summons was a clarion call, crisp and clear. Would that a certain resident of the vice presidential mansion add her public voice to the fight to preserve the rule of law and protect our imperiled democracy.","summary":"Second Lady Usha Vance's old law firm opposes the president's intimidation effort while former Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff is crossways with his law firm.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-04-17/barabak-column-trump-lawfare-usha-vance-doug-emhoff","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f8e2ec1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3079x1616+0+218/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F18%2F0e%2Fcb35d4dfd66f578ac768d4eeb1f3%2Ff35c9320062c45c7abe7","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 10:00:58","author":"Mark Z.

How's that going over in Little Saigon?","text":"ABC Supermarket in the heart of Little Saigon is like a Donald Trump tariff rant come to fragrant, tasty life. Sorghum liquors from China. Frozen seafood from Malaysia. Thai fish sauce. Japanese candies. A galaxy of products from Vietnam, of course. All of these imports would be slammed by the massive tariffs that Trump threatened to impose on many Asian nations until putting a pause on the plan, with Vietnam, at 46%, among the highest. But in Little Saigon, enmity for the Vietnamese government, which proclaims itself Communist even as the country's economy developed a niche exporting manufactured goods, thrives among the older generation, many of whom arrived in the U.S. as refugees after the fall of Saigon nearly 50 years ago. Some are even willing to pay higher prices if it means the Communist regime will suffer. “Everything will become more expensive, but if it hurts the Vietnamese government, I’m for it,” said Diep Truong, 65, whose cart held a jackfruit the size of a pillow. “If the president says it will help America, then I’m for it.” But John Nguyen, 39, worries that consumers accustomed to a wide variety of imported foods from Asia won't be able to afford the higher prices that tariffs could bring. “All these people aren’t rich,” said Nguyen, the son of Vietnamese refugees, as he gestured to other shoppers in the parking lot of the supermarket in Westminster, his cart groaning with bags of rice and canned pho. “So much of Vietnamese food comes from Vietnam. How are we supposed to be able to pay more money for food when it’s already expensive?” The tech worker didn't vote in the 2024 election, despising Trump but unimpressed with Kamala Harris. His parents are Trump supporters and don't seem to mind the president's trade war. \"Let's see how they feel when we're paying way more for our dinner,\" he said bitterly. That generational divide was evident in many of the conversations I had with shoppers and business owners in Little Saigon, where the Republican Party has long held sway for its traditional anti-Communist stance and where support for Trump remains strong among older Vietnamese immigrants, even as many of their children reject the GOP. Over the decades, doing business with Vietnam has evolved from an affront that could result in death threats to a common profession that keeps Little Saigon stores stocked with affordable goods. Stephanie Nguyen fled Vietnam 30 years ago and now runs a business that imports supplements and skin care products from Japan, which also faced a steep tariff. She admitted that the stock market instability caused by Trump's tariff threats has walloped her portfolio. “But we have to sacrifice a bit for the benefit of this country,” said the 52-year-old, who \"proudly\" voted for Trump three times. “I can't go back to Vietnam. This is my home country now, so we need to do what we have to do to protect and support the USA.” Other importers fear for their bottom line, including some in the nail salon industry that has lifted many Vietnamese Americans into the middle class. Vy Nguyen moved to the U.S. nine years ago for college and now runs import operations for Nghia, her family’s nail-trimming equipment business. The tariffs “would be devastating if it happens,” she said at Nghia’s small showroom in Garden Grove. “I understand where he [Trump] is coming from, but all of this falls on small business and customers.” Nguyen, 26, had just returned from a trade show where the president's trade war “was all that people wanted to talk about.” She already had to slash a recent order from Vietnam from $1 million to $500,000 due to a lower sales forecast if the tariffs are implemented. The shipment will take far longer to arrive than usual and cost more, because \"everyone is trying to export right now\" to stay within Trump's 90-day tariff pause. “I know that in the American community, one or two dollars more doesn’t seem much,\" Nguyen said. \"But for Vietnamese, even that increase is super sensitive to everyone.” Nearby at Tu Luc Bookstore, manager Eric Duong estimated that 70% of the Vietnamese-language books on the shelves are imported from Vietnam. Duong didn’t want to offer an opinion on “something that hasn’t happened yet.\" But he said that Tu Luc, a destination for readers for 41 years, has already seen a big drop in sales this year. If tariffs do come, “we would try to do the best and keep it affordable, but we don’t know what’s next,” Duong said. “We’re just waiting for Trump to do something, and that waiting is hard.” Vietnam is the world's sixth-largest exporter to the U.S., from major companies like Nike and Lululemon to the small makers in stock at ABC Supermarket. The U.S. trade deficit with Vietnam is about $123.5 billion, putting the country near the top of Trump's list for \"reciprocal\" tariffs. This would have been unimaginable a generation ago. When then-President Bill Clinton announced the end of a U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam in 1994, hundreds of people rallied on Bolsa Avenue, Little Saigon's main drag, to decry the decision. For a good decade afterward, anyone in Little Saigon who openly sought to establish business relations with Vietnam could expect accusations of being a Communist. Protesters greeted Vietnamese government officials who came to Orange County to talk opportunities. One of those protesters was Janet Nguyen. As an O.C. supervisor in 2007, she stood outside a Dana Point resort with hundreds of others to blast an appearance by Vietnam's then-president, Nguyen Minh Triet. Nguyen, who served as a state Assembly member and senator before returning to the O.C. Board of Supervisors last year, has sent a letter to every American president since George W. Bush, urging them not to be easy on Vietnam when it comes to free trade. \"In Vietnam, the government gets wealthier, not the people,\" said the supervisor, 48, who fled Vietnam on a boat with her family as a child. \"If you're going to benefit from America, you've got to benefit your people, not the Communist Party.\" She admitted that Trump’s strategy — including tariffs on countries other than Vietnam — could affect her district, which encompasses Little Saigon. “It might spike prices, and services might be reduced, and projects will have to be put on pause,\" Nguyen said. \"But we’re just going to have to wait and see.” Vietnamese American Chamber of Commerce Chair Tim Nguyen, 42, said his group has received a “spike” of website visits and phone calls from frantic members. “Everyone is very on the edge trying to see what to do,” said Nguyen, who imported pickup truck parts from China until Trump’s 2019 tariffs helped sink his company. “The best thing we can do right now is be a conveyor of information so we can calm people down.” The chamber, more than any other group in Little Saigon, has been at the forefront of promoting trade with Vietnam, often at great personal cost. Its founding president, Dr. Co Pham, wore a bulletproof vest at his medical practice because of threats stemming from his stance that better business relations could bring freedom to his homeland. When Tam Nguyen was asked to succeed Pham in 2009, he worried that doing so “might expose my family’s business to criticism.” Nguyen, 51, whose family fled Vietnam when he was a baby, is the chair of Advance Beauty College, a beauty school started by his parents that has trained tens of thousands of manicurists over the decades. Growing up, Nguyen felt a gap with the older generation, who “were so adamant to not do any trade with Vietnam. I could never understand their trauma.” Now, he said, \"a Little Saigon business is a global business,\" and \"everyone seems to be importing something.\" Over the years, the tags on his clothing have progressed through a parade of Asian countries: China, Japan, Indonesia. “Today, it’s ‘Made in Vietnam,’ and it brings me great pride,” Nguyen said. “My cousins back in Vietnam have better jobs now. I don’t have the angst of my parents' generation. And it’s so normalized to the point where my children don’t even think of [Vietnamese products] as being political.\" He is concerned that the tariffs will have a ripple effect across Little Saigon, because \"we’re not just the workforce — we’re the entire supply chain. But if anything, this will bring us together, and we’ll figure it all out. Our people are resilient — we adapt. That’s what we’ve done for 50 years, and look what we have created.” At Coffee Factory in Westminster last year, Clinton campaigned for Derek Tran, who later won his congressional race. A generation ago, community members would have shouted down Clinton for normalizing relations with Vietnam. This time around, it was all people with smartphones joyously taking photos. I stopped by the cafe on a recent morning with my colleague Anh Do, who introduced me to customers and sometimes helped translate. Some people told us they took Trump's side on the tariffs — and they didn't have anything nice to say about the Vietnamese government. Thanh Trieu, 55, whose family is in the pharmacy business, sat outside with a group of friends. Resting on the table next to a pack of cigarettes, a copy of the Vietnamese-language newspaper Vien Dong included a column about the tariffs, complete with a photo of Trump. “It’s not gonna affect us immediately,” Trieu said. “America has so much debt. We have no choice but to do this. Someone’s gonna get hurt, someone’s gonna get profit. It might as well be us [Americans] who win.” Giau Nguyen, 63, walked over from his hair salon a few doors down, decked out in an Elvis-style pompadour and a shirt featuring the U.S. Constitution underneath a pattern of bald eagles and the Stars and Stripes. He acknowledged that tariffs would hurt his business, “but just a little, not much. This is going to hurt in the short run, but at the end it’s fair, and I support what’s fair. Other countries have been cheating America in the long run.” Inside, Tony Fukukawa was about to dig into a bánh mì and slices of grilled pork when I sat down to talk with him. He was raised in Japan by Vietnamese parents, and his family imports tractors from Japan and Vietnam. Fukukawa, 22, hadn’t heard about the proposed tariffs. A stunned look crossed his face when I told him. “Wow,” he finally said. “It’s going to damage us. It’s not good for us.” He asked about Trump's rationale, and I explained the president's sentiment that Vietnam and other countries that import a lot of goods to the U.S. have taken advantage of us for too long. “What advantage does the United States get against Vietnam?\" Fukukawa wondered. \"I don’t think it sounds fair at all.”","summary":"In Little Saigon, enmity for the Vietnamese government thrives among the older generation, many of whom arrived in the U.S. as refugees after the fall of Saigon.

Eleven days after his appointment as White House communications director in July 2017, Scaramucci got dismissed, which the vocal Trump critic now sees as a point of pride.The war of words with Trump goes both ways. White House spokesman Kush Desai told BI: \"Anthony Scaramucci is a fraud and a disgraced clown with no standing to comment on President Trump's historic action to finally address the national emergency posed by our country's chronic trade deficits.\"Scaramucci is no stranger to such criticism. It doesn't stop him from speaking his mind on Trump's trade and economic policy — or how Republicans and Democrats should fight back.Over the course of his career in politics and finance, Scaramucci has been tied to both major US political parties and now finds himself somewhere in the middle.The financier has seesawed between Democrats and Republicans, supporting Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton before distancing himself from them. He called Trump a \"hack politician\" on Fox Business in 2015 and endorsed other Republicans in 2016, but eventually joined Trump's team. He then got fired by Trump but still backed him, before changing his tune in 2019. He then supported Joe Biden in 2020 and Kamala Harris in 2024.This back-and-forth suggests Scaramucci has become a man without a party in the Trump age, and he has a hunch that he's not alone.In the coming years, Scaramucci thinks other disaffected Republicans may stray from Trump's populism and form a new party, just as Republicans split off from the Whigs in the 1850s.\"The new Whig party is the MAGA party, which has the Republican name — in name only,\" Scaramucci said on California Governor Gavin Newsom's podcast in early April. He added that \"they're the true RINOs,\" using the acronym for Republicans in name only.This fissure will follow the implosion of Trump's trade and economic policies, in Scaramucci's view. Republicans control the White House and Congress, so there will be no one else to blame.For most of the last decade, resisting Trump has been a career-ending mistake for Republicans. But if the next year and a half goes how Scaramucci thinks it will, politicians who've been friendly with Trump may have to create separation from him ahead of the midterm elections.\"There's no House Republican that's going to go into '26 and say, 'Hey, we're in a steep recession as a result of [the] Smoot-Hawley redo in 2025, and we're with Donald Trump,'\" Scaramucci said. \"Because Donald Trump is going to be a lame duck the day after the election is over in 2026.\"Trump won't be around forever, as the US Constitution prevents presidents from being elected more than twice. That could give Republicans the courage they need to go against their leader.\"I don't think the Republicans are going to be able to say, 'This is phenomenal — the \"orange cult leader\" is awesome,'\" Scaramucci said. \"I don't see that. I think that his status — the bronze statue turns into paper mache, and then he starts to get hit by the other Republicans like a piñata.\"Although Scaramucci dislikes Trump, he thinks Democrats can still learn from him.A key aspect of Trump's political rise was that people saw him as authentic, for better or worse. His brashness was seen by some as rude or off-putting, but others found it refreshing.Scaramucci also said on Newsom's podcast he hears kernels of truth in Trump's rhetoric, even though he often finds him dishonest. Democrats who downplayed the issues at the border or economic struggles of the middle class made a mistake, even if they dislike Trump's tactics.Another political liability for Democrats is what's known as \"woke-ism,\" in Scaramucci's mind. He told BI after Harris lost last fall that \"the average person in America does not like the hard-left culture that's being imposed upon them,\" and Trump took advantage of that perceived flaw.\"Trump is winning the culture war,\" Scaramucci recently told BI. \"He is the Napoleon of the culture war. He's the best field general out there, in terms of understanding the culture. He has literally sent the Democrats into a splintered disarray where they're fighting with each other.\"For example, Scaramucci noted that some on the left are angry with Newsom for consistently appearing on Fox News and, more recently, using his podcast to give a platform to controversial figures like far-right political strategist Steve Bannon and conservative activist Charlie Kirk.This response is moralistic, in Scaramucci's view. He thinks Democrats should speak more to moderates and disgruntled Republicans to enlist everyone they can in the fight against Trump.\"I think the only way that Democrats are going to win is if they can rebut the culture war,\" Scaramucci said. \"And therefore, they've got to demonstrate they can get in the center.\"Lastly, Democrats need better messaging, Scaramucci said. Marketing their accomplishments is one of their biggest weaknesses, and that vacuum gave room for Trump to push his trade policy.\"Globalism has actually worked,\" Scaramucci said. \"Is it with flaws? Sure. Did we leave China unchecked for too long? Yes, we did. Did we lose too many factories? Yes, we did. But globalism has primarily worked. We're an unbelievably rich and unbelievably prosperous nation as a percentage of overall world output versus our population.\"When asked if there was anyone he thought would step up among Democrats, Scaramucci had a simple answer that may startle the left: \"I don't. They're in complete disarray.\"","summary":"Anthony Scaramucci thinks the US economy is in danger and expects Republicans to ditch Trump.

It's routinely the top holding in the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -2.66%) (BRK.B -2.13%), Buffett's conglomerate. \n\nBut for multiple quarters last year, Berkshire had been trimming its position in the iPhone maker, leading some investors to wonder if the billionaire investor is no longer as optimistic about the tech company.\n\nNot only do I think that's not true, here's why I also believe he probably added to his position amid the market's recent sell-off.\n\nWhy Buffett may have been trimming his position in Apple to begin with\n\nIn November 2024, investors noticed that he reduced his stake in the tech company for a fourth consecutive quarter. At that point, he had sold more than 615 million shares over the past year. While his reasons are usually not known for why he buys or sells a stock each time, one possible reason could be to do with taxes.\n\nIn the past, he has voiced concern that the tax rate on capital gains might rise. And presidential candidate Kamala Harris did suggest increasing it.\n\nBuffett, in looking out for Berkshire shareholders, may have wanted to sell off a big chunk of Apple stock before that happened, to avoid a hefty tax bill for the company given the shares' mammoth rise in value over the years. And rather that spooking the markets with one large stock sale, spreading it out over multiple quarters might have made more sense.\n\nBut whether it's to do with taxes or Apple's rising valuation, there would have been no reason to believe that he thought the business was in trouble. It consistently generates more than $90 billion in profit each year, and its revenue over the trailing 12 months has totaled nearly $400 billion. Its services business continues to grow, and although investors today may be worried about tariffs, at the time of the stock sales there would have been no glaring reason for worry.\n\nWhy now may be an opportune time for Buffett to load up on Apple stock\n\nDuring the current quarter, which began in April, I would expect to see a big purchase from Berkshire, adding to its position in Apple. Under President Donald Trump, capital gains taxes might not increase, and it's possible he could even decrease them.\n\nEither way, the risk is considerably much lower under the current administration, which may alleviate any concerns Buffett had about a rising tax rate, at least for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhat is notable is that he stopped selling Apple stock in the fourth quarter of 2024 -- when the election took place and the risk of Harris raising capital gains taxes was gone. It may have just been a coincidence, but it's hard to ignore the timing. \n\nAnother incentive to buy the stock is Apple's crash after Trump's declaration of \"Liberation Day\" and the announcement of global tariffs. That caused investors to dump their shares on fears that tariffs would significantly raise costs for the tech company.\n\nThe stock would end up falling, and on April 8 it closed at $172.42 -- not far from its 52-week low of $164.08. For Buffett, that may have created a buying opportunity too appealing to pass up. And I believe with the tax fears alleviated and Berkshire's position in Apple being significantly reduced, it would have made it easy to justify adding to its stake in the consumer tech company at some point this month.\n\nWhile the tariff risk is still there, for a long-term investor such as Buffett, I don't believe it would have necessarily dissuaded him from buying the stock.\n\nIs Apple stock a good buy right now?\n\nIf you're a long-term investor, you'll want to consider buying and holding Apple for not just years but decades. Tariffs could cause problems for its operations in the short run but if you're investing for the long haul, it may not matter all that much in the end.\n\nThe company's fundamentals remain strong, and with an excellent brand behind it, Apple is one of the safest and best growth stocks you can hold in your portfolio today.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/17/prediction-warren-buffett-will-buy-more-apple-stoc/?source=askdougpancakes&utm_source=chromefollow&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=news&referring_guid=3373714e-120c-468f-8bfe-57d198b19801","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F814602%2Fwarren-buffett-in-a-group-of-people.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 09:03:00","author":"David Jagielski","authors":["David Jagielski"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.594},{"id":312053174,"title":"George Clooney explains why he called out Biden to quit 2024 presidential race","text":"Oscar-winning actor and long-time Democrat George Clooney has defended his controversial New York Times op-ed calling on Joe Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race, saying it was his “civic duty” to speak up. Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper in a new interview, Clooney said, “Well, I don’t know if it was brave… It was a civic duty.” George Clooney: \"I’m a Democrat, but when my side stopped telling the truth, I had to speak up.\"pic.twitter.com/KKqyotaq3N— Department of Government Efficiency News (@DOGE__news) April 17, 2025 Clooney wrote the July 2024 opinion piece weeks after co-hosting a star-studded fundraiser that brought in $30 million for Biden’s campaign. The event was later overshadowed by Biden’s awkward appearance and a moment where former President Barack Obama had to escort him off stage. Clooney claimed that the Joe Biden he met at the fundraiser was not the same man he knew from 2010 or even 2020. “The one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can,” he wrote.In his op-ed, Clooney expressed concern about the president’s declining fitness and the Democratic Party’s denial of the issue. “We are not going to win in November with this president,” he bluntly declared, warning that Biden’s re-election bid would ensure a Trump victory. He urged party leaders to “stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw” during Biden’s debate with Trump on June 27, 2024.Although Biden’s campaign reportedly tried to dissuade Clooney from publishing the piece, it went live, and the president officially ended his campaign on July 21, 2024. Clooney later endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who inherited a fractured campaign. Reflecting on the transition, Clooney said, “It’s hard to run against yourself and say, ‘Well, I disagree with all this.’”Clooney also expressed disappointment that there was no Democratic primary after Biden’s withdrawal. He argued that while Harris could have won such a contest, the party would have benefited from open competition. “I think we have some really good governors,” he said, naming Andy Beshear, Gretchen Whitmer, and notably Maryland Governor Wes Moore. “He’s a proper leader. … I like him a lot. I think he could be someone we could all join in behind.”In the interview, Clooney also reflected on freedom of speech and accountability. “You can’t demand freedom of speech and then say, but don’t say bad things about me… You have to take a stand if you believe in it, take a stance, stand for it, and then deal with the consequences. That’s the rules,” he said.Clooney, who is currently starring in a Broadway adaptation of Good Night, and Good Luck, drew parallels between his theatre work and modern American politics, particularly the importance of dissent and a free press. “It doesn’t matter what political bend you are on… those are extraordinarily powerful words for who we are at our best,” he said, referencing the legacy of journalist Edward R. Murrow.","summary":"George Clooney defended his New York Times op-ed urging Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, citing it as a \"civic duty.\" He expressed concerns about Biden's declining fitness and the Democratic Party's denial, leading to Biden's eventual withdrawal and Kamala Harris inheriting a fractured campaign.

The Democrats painted themselves into a dark corner last year with Vice President Kamala Harris picking uber-liberal Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor, as her running mate. Both may try to run in 2028; each will get beaten like a redheaded stepchild.\n\nSure, there’s Gretchen Whitmer, the two-term governor of Michigan — a swing state that Mr. Trump won by just 80,103 votes out of 5.7 million cast — but again, she seems more like a veep than a POTUS. California Gov. Gavin Newsom will surely run, but he carries heavy baggage. The rest of the wannabes are backbench minor leaguers.\n\nOne person out there who fits the bill is young, sharp, idealistic, savvy on social media, and able to draw voters to the polls and raise absurd amounts of money: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nWhen AOC came onto the scene, the old guard in the Republican Party wet their Depends. They saw her as a godsend. Between gulps off their tanks of oxygen, they said, let’s make her the face of the Democratic Party. And so they did.\n\nThat didn’t work out so well. The former bartender from the Bronx is now drawing massive crowds as part of a “Fighting Oligarchy” tour with the avuncular Sen. Bernard Sanders. She has a gold-standard operation that raised nearly $10 million in the first quarter of the year. She is tenacious, having survived a reelection challenge where Republicans threw millions of dollars to her opponent. She has now reached the age set in the Constitution, 35, to run for the highest office in the land.\n\nThere was a time in America when young people couldn’t be bothered to vote, but that’s so 20th century. Since 2008, winning Democratic candidates have pulled at least 60% support from young voters, who have turned out in droves. Yes, they didn’t much like Ms. Harris, but after four more years of Mr. Trump, the young could return to the fold.\n\n“So many of us know what it feels like for life to be one bad day, one bad piece of news, one major setback from everything feeling like it’s going to fall apart. And we don’t have to live like this anymore, Utah!” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez told a crowd of 20,000 last week. “We can make a new world, a better country where we can fight for the dignity of all people.”\n\nMr. Sanders, who was screwed out of the Democratic nomination in 2016 when party leaders skewed the process to nominate Hillary Clinton, is handing off his formidable machine to AOC. “I want to say a word about Alexandria,” the liberal from Vermont said at another rally, “and why what she’s doing is so important.”\n\nBefore he could finish, someone yelled, “Future president!” The crowd erupted in cheers.\n\nAOC has battled ancient battle-ax Rep. Nancy Pelosi. Days after her election, she participated in a climate change protest sit-in in Mrs. Pelosi’s office. She has also been vocal about banning federal lawmakers from trading on the stock market. Mrs. Pelosi is worth more than $200 million, thanks to her insider trading.\n\nSure, she is hard left, but the days when candidates had to tack to the middle after the primaries seem long gone. Mr. Trump didn’t, and he won. President Biden also didn’t bother seeking the middle. He made clear that he would be as left-wing as they come, and he was. Opening the border puts you about as far left as you can go.\n\nDemocratic Party elders will bristle as we near the selection of candidates, but with AOC’s social media following, she might well be positioned to work around them. She is media savvy, young, vibrant and so different from the last pair of dinosaur presidents, who drooled and stumbled their way through office.\n\nNo one is saying she is waltzing into the nomination, but really, who else do the Democrats have? They might finally listen to their most ardent supporters and put up a candidate they really want to see in office.\n\nIf they do, Republicans could have a hard time coming up with someone who can go head-to-head with the bartender from the Bronx.\n\n• Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.

The cello came with the rental property.\n\nLots of celebrities talked during the 2016, 2020 and 2024 elections about moving abroad if Donald Trump won – among them, Barbra Streisand, Cher and Amy Schumer.\n\nO’Donnell actually went through with it.\n\n“I never thought he would win again,” she said of Trump, bringing up the television clips she watched last year of Kamala Harris, then the vice-president, appearing at packed arenas in Pennsylvania and Michigan. “But I said, ‘If he does, I’m going to move,’ and my therapist said, ‘Well, let’s make a real plan’”.\n\nIt so happens that O’Donnell had reservations about discussing all this with a reporter.\n\nHer application for Irish citizenship has not yet been approved and she is worried about doing anything to jeopardise that. Technically, she and her youngest child, Clay, who is autistic and nonbinary, are still just visiting the country.\n\nThat being said, O’Donnell has a documentary she wants to promote – Unleashing Hope: The Power of Service Dogs for Autism, the story of a programme in which incarcerated people train service dogs in prison, after which the dogs are placed with families like hers.\n\nO’Donnell did appear on The Late Late Show a few weeks back. On it, she talked about her new life in the country, hurled some insults at Trump and gave every indication that she would be remaining over there for the foreseeable future.\n\n[ Trump’s tariffs agenda will be ‘horrible’ for world, says Rosie O’DonnellOpens in new window ]\n\nBut much of her focus at the moment is on the documentary, which was inspired partly by, of all things, her unlikely relationship with Lyle Menendez, the convicted murderer.\n\nO’Donnell, of course, has been feuding with Trump since 2006, when she joined The View, a US chatfest created by anchorwoman Barbara Walters.\n\nOn the show, in response to what she felt was Trump’s receiving overly positive coverage for his treatment of a controversy involving a Miss USA contestant, O’Donnell mocked Trump, flipping her hair over her face and delivering a withering impersonation while questioning his role as a moral arbiter and a successful business-person.\n\nTrump threatened to sue The View and Walters personally. Walters got on the phone with him to smooth things over. Soon enough, Trump was appearing all over cable news calling O’Donnell “wacko” and “fat”, and he said Walters personally told him that she regretted hiring O’Donnell.\n\nThe year after, despite soaring ratings, O’Donnell left the show. But her feud with Trump never ended.\n\n[ Rosie O’Donnell moving to Ireland to escape Trump administrationOpens in new window ]\n\nShe became a fixture and a punchline in the US supermarket tabloids, which she always suspected, but was unable to prove, was the work of Trump and Michael Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer who went to prison after pleading guilty to campaign-finance violations, tax fraud and bank fraud.\n\nWhile incarcerated at the federal correctional facility in Otisville, New York, Cohen received what he said in a phone interview on Friday was a letter from O’Donnell.\n\n“It was so heartwarming and compassionate I actually thought I was being punked,” he said. She then visited Cohen in prison and was in touch with him in the days before Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records.\n\nIt may seem like a case of politics making strange bedfellows, but it was pretty typical behaviour for O’Donnell, who has a habit of finding the good in controversial people.\n\nFriends of hers include Lynndie England, the former United States Army Reserve soldier who was prosecuted for mistreating detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. O’Donnell reached out to England during her 2005 trial, believing that she was being turned into a scapegoat for the injustices of the Iraq War.\n\nAnd there is Reality Winner, the former military contractor who pleaded guilty to felony transmission of national defence information after leaking classified documents about Russian interference in the 2016 election to The Intercept, a non-profit news site. During the trial, O’Donnell got in touch with Winner’s mother, Billie Winner-Davis, and later had Winner on her podcast.\n\nBut no friendship of O’Donnell’s is more surprising than the one she has with Lyle Menendez, who along with his brother, Erik, was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life without parole for the 1989 slaying of their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez.\n\nWhile the brothers were on trial in 1996, O’Donnell gave an interview on Larry King Live in which she said that she believed the brothers had been molested as children and that the murders were, in some way, an act of self-defence.\n\nSoon after, she received a letter from Lyle Menendez.\n\nIn it, he thanked her for her support and stated his belief that she “knew” from a personal place that what he was saying was true. O’Donnell did: She said she and her siblings had been molested by their father.\n\n[ Rosie O’Donnell says she was sexually abused by her fatherOpens in new window ]\n\nIn 2022, after watching a documentary about the Menendez brothers, O’Donnell discussed their case on TikTok, reiterating her belief that they were sexual abuse survivors who killed their parents out of a sense of trauma and desperation.\n\nSoon after, she said, Lyle Menendez’s wife, Rebecca Sneed, reached out to her to see if she was interested in speaking with him.\n\nTheir first conversation lasted two or three hours, O’Donnell said.\n\n“Then he started calling me on a regular basis from the tablet phone thing they have,” she said. “He would tell me about his life, what he’s been doing in prison and, for the first time in my life, I felt safe enough to trust and be vulnerable and love a straight man.”\n\nSome of her friends expressed concern. “They were like, ‘Ro, he’s a murderer,’” she said.\n\nShe shrugged, then went to visit him in prison, where she saw scores of inmates with Labrador retrievers stationed silently at their feet.\n\nO’Donnell asked Menendez how this could possibly be legal and he told her about a programme they had to train and place dogs with blind, disabled veterans and autistic children. He suggested O’Donnell get a dog for Clay through the programme.\n\nO’Donnell said she felt uneasy at first. Clay is a highly verbal child and O’Donnell, aware of her celebrity status, did not want to jump in front of someone who could not function without a highly trained service dog. But Menendez told her not to worry: The dogs were distributed according to need.\n\nA year later, she was approved for a dog.\n\nO’Donnell spent two weeks commuting daily to the prison, where she was matched with Kuma, a black Labrador mix who had been trained for a year by Carlos Aguirre, an inmate doing time for armed robbery. (Although the dog winds up working principally with the autistic child, the intensive training takes place between the dog and an adult.)\n\nKuma bonded instantly with Clay when she came home. “I noticed the difference in Clay immediately,” she said. “I was shocked to find out that all the stories I heard from other mothers of autistic children were true.”\n\nSo O’Donnell decided to film a short documentary about the program. The result of that, which was produced by Hilary Estey McLoughlin and Terrence Noonan – veterans of her late-1990s talkshow – will be released on Hulu on April 22nd.\n\nWhile the documentary was filming, O’Donnell read Project 2025, a document created by the US Heritage Foundation that laid out a right-wing agenda for a potential second Trump term. She believed Trump when he said he would be a dictator on Day 1, and she did not believe him when he said Project 2025 reflected anything other than a specific plan for what he would do as president.\n\n“World tragic events have always wiped me out emotionally,” she said. “I believe it stemmed from watching the Vietnam War on television as a little kid during dinner and seeing unbearably graphic horror on the news.”\n\n[ Rosie O’Donnell calls Trump a ‘cheater’ and ‘Russian asset’ after Oval Office insultOpens in new window ]\n\nThe first Trump term was debilitating for her.\n\n“I was unbelievably heavy, I was drinking too much,” she said. “But there were guardrails.”\n\nIn the campaign’s final weeks, she made preparations. Just in case.\n\n“I got my passport renewed, I got Clay’s passport renewed,” she said. “My brother has his passport. All my cousins have their passports. But I was never a traveller.”\n\nSo moving to Ireland felt strange, although she has been pleasantly surprised by how much she likes it.\n\n“I see reflections of myself in this country everywhere I look, and reflections of my family and my very Irish childhood,” she said. “We’re 100 per cent Irish. Being Irish Catholic was a very big part of my identity, and coming back here does feel like coming home in a way that’s hard to explain or understand, even for me.”\n\nThe people, she said, are unusually friendly. When they approach her in public, they do so in a way that feels “1,000 per cent different than in the United States.”\n\nThere was an uncomfortable moment, however, when she watched the Taoiseach Micheál Martin meet Trump at the Oval Office during a televised appearance.\n\nThere, Brian Glenn, a reporter from the right-wing news outlet Real America’s Voice asked Martin why he was allowing O’Donnell to move there when all she could do was “bring unhappiness” to the country.\n\nMartin seemed to wince in his chair. But he was able to avoid the question because Trump jumped in to say what a good question that was and went about insulting O’Donnell himself.\n\nAfterward, O’Donnell sent a letter saying how embarrassed she was to have become a topic of conversation during what should have been a serious meeting.\n\nIt was yet another chapter in a feud with Trump that has been going for nearly 20 years. But given O’Donnell’s seeming ability to forge relationships with various castaways, criminals and other notorious people, it seemed fair to ask: Could she see any good residing in him?\n\n“None,” she said. – This article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"Actor and comedian pledged to leave the US if Donald Trump regained office and has since relocated to Ireland","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/tv-radio/2025/04/17/rosie-odonnell-on-her-new-life-in-dublin-i-see-reflections-of-myself-in-this-country-everywhere-i-look/","image":"https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/QGJRLILBNKO67Q3RFQZ5EDGVYY.jpg?auth=0dfc4cdd51633b943aef2bab4e0b33af50e2bdb312dfd298312d265a258497f9&smart=true&width=1600&height=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 04:00:00","author":"Jacob Bernstein","authors":["Jacob Bernstein"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.222},{"id":311952668,"title":"Storm Surge From Cyclone Tam Batters Auckland Pier","text":"The IndependentNorthern Lights to be visible again tonight after dazzling parts of UK – here’s where and how to see themThe Met Office forecast the effects of a coronial mass ejection - a burst of material from the sun into space - would result in the colourful displays across northern parts of the UK from Tuesday evening\n\nBirmingham LiveUK weather map turns blue as -3C 'Artic blast' to hit in weeksForecasters have warned that cold weather could be on the way\n\n Why this ad?Go ad-free* \n\nPA Media: VideoCampaigners say Supreme Court ruling on gender is a 'victory for biology'The Supreme Court’s ruling on the definition of a woman in equality law has been hailed as \"a victory for biology, for common sense and for reality'\".

So where is Kamala Harris?","text":"Congressional Democrats are finding a fighting spirit as Donald Trump and his administration defy court orders to return a wrongfully-deported man.\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia’s deportation to El Salvador, which the Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department have admitted was an error, remains one of the biggest issues in Washington. \n\nA growing number of Democrats and legal experts now have the same prognosis: America is in a “constitutional crisis”, as the White House and broader federal government ignore court orders to facilitate the return of a man officials have now spent days accusing, without a shred of real evidence, of being a gang member.\n\nAnd for the most part, the Democratic Party is unified — and finally finding a voice.\n\nLeaders of the opposition party came out this week with forceful statements demanding the Trump administration comply with the courts. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, on Wednesday, joined a handful of other Democratic senators in announcing that he’d place a hold on the administration’s nominees for two key US attorney positions.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, whose chamber is not involved in the nomination process, took his own stand at a press conference in Brooklyn.\n\n\"The Trump administration has acknowledged [that Garcia’s deportation was committed in error] and so they need to comply with the Supreme Court's directive or the Supreme Court needs to enforce its order aggressively, which should include contempt,” said the House Democratic leader.\n\nAn official Twitter account for the House Democratic caucus and a whole host of other Democratic lawmakers have now released statements on the issue of Abrego Garcia’s deportation as well — a moment of (mostly) unity for the party which fractured in January with the passage of the Laken Riley Act and again in March in the face of a battle over a government shutdown.\n\n“Ask yourself—what’s going to stop the government from deporting you to a prison in El Salvador?” wrote Jim McGovern, the senior Democrat on the powerful Rules committee. “The people get it. Either everyone has due process—or nobody does.”\n\nEven John Fetterman, an outlier in his party after breaking with Democrats — hard — on both support for the scale and ferocity of the Israeli assault on Gaza as well as the Laken Riley Act, found that elusive cohesion with his caucus.\n\n“The Supreme Court made a unanimous decision, saying the lower Court’s order “properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release,” wrote the Pennsylvania senator. “Calling on the White House to follow this directive.”\n\nChris Van Hollen, of Garcia’s home state, apparently understood the assignment. He reportedly drew a standing ovation at his own town hall Tuesday evening by announcing a visit to El Salvador to attempt to speak with Abrego Garcia, then did so the very next day. Other Democrats are seeking a full congressional delegation from the House. They may push ahead with a visit even if Speaker Mike Johnson doesn’t approve it.\n\nThe party’s unification around Abrego Garcia’s case has pushed any dissenting voices underground. \n\nOne of them, identified only as a centrist House Democrat, aired a very dismissive complaint to Axios on Wednesday, while referring to yet another wrongful deportation case: \"Rather than talking about the tariff policy and the economy ... the thing where his numbers are tanking, we're going to go take the bait for one hairdresser.”\n\nWith those few exceptions in mind, Democrats seem to be meeting the moment, spurred by enraged activist groups and voters alike.\n\nBut there’s one big question on the minds of those who are looking to see who emerges as the party’s next standard bearer. Two, actually: Where is Joe? Where is Kamala?\n\nBoth Democrats who ran for president in 2024 have largely dropped off the face of the earth since that disastrous November drubbing at the hands of Donald Trump. Joe Biden gave his first big speech since leaving office on Tuesday — he appeared tired, and stumbled through his speech at times, and couldn’t attack Trump by name. His address did not touch on the administration’s deportations. \n\nWith his political career behind him, however, few are expecting a fiery Biden to emerge to rally the troops.\n\nIt’s Kamala Harris whose silence is more surprising. Despite her well-reported future political ambitions, the ex-vice president has not said a word about Abrego Garcia on social media, has largely ceased holding public events for the time being, and has had nothing to say about the “constitutional crisis” which her former peers in Congress now say the US faces.

So where is Kamala Harris?","text":"Congressional Democrats are finding a fighting spirit as Donald Trump and his administration defy court orders to return a wrongfully-deported man.\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia’s deportation to El Salvador, which the Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department have admitted was an error, remains one of the biggest issues in Washington.\n\nA growing number of Democrats and legal experts now have the same prognosis: America is in a “constitutional crisis”, as the White House and broader federal government ignore court orders to facilitate the return of a man officials have now spent days accusing, without a shred of real evidence, of being a gang member.\n\nAnd for the most part, the Democratic Party is unified — and finally finding a voice.\n\nLeaders of the opposition party came out this week with forceful statements demanding the Trump administration comply with the courts. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, on Wednesday, joined a handful of other Democratic senators in announcing that he’d place a hold on the administration’s nominees for two key US attorney positions.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, whose chamber is not involved in the nomination process, took his own stand at a press conference in Brooklyn.\n\n\"The Trump administration has acknowledged [that Garcia’s deportation was committed in error] and so they need to comply with the Supreme Court's directive or the Supreme Court needs to enforce its order aggressively, which should include contempt,” said the House Democratic leader.\n\nAn official Twitter account for the House Democratic caucus and a whole host of other Democratic lawmakers have now released statements on the issue of Abrego Garcia’s deportation as well — a moment of (mostly) unity for the party which fractured in January with the passage of the Laken Riley Act and again in March in the face of a battle over a government shutdown.\n\n“Ask yourself—what’s going to stop the government from deporting you to a prison in El Salvador?” wrote Jim McGovern, the senior Democrat on the powerful Rules committee. “The people get it. Either everyone has due process—or nobody does.”\n\nEven John Fetterman, an outlier in his party after breaking with Democrats — hard — on both support for the scale and ferocity of the Israeli assault on Gaza as well as the Laken Riley Act, found that elusive cohesion with his caucus.\n\n“The Supreme Court made a unanimous decision, saying the lower Court’s order “properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release,” wrote the Pennsylvania senator. “Calling on the White House to follow this directive.”\n\nChris Van Hollen, of Garcia’s home state, apparently understood the assignment. He reportedly drew a standing ovation at his own town hall Tuesday evening by announcing a visit to El Salvador to attempt to speak with Abrego Garcia, then did so the very next day. Other Democrats are seeking a full congressional delegation from the House. They may push ahead with a visit even if Speaker Mike Johnson doesn’t approve it.\n\nThe party’s unification around Abrego Garcia’s case has pushed any dissenting voices underground.\n\nOne of them, identified only as a centrist House Democrat, aired a very dismissive complaint to Axios on Wednesday, while referring to yet another wrongful deportation case: \"Rather than talking about the tariff policy and the economy ... the thing where his numbers are tanking, we're going to go take the bait for one hairdresser.”\n\nWith those few exceptions in mind, Democrats seem to be meeting the moment, spurred by enraged activist groups and voters alike.\n\nBut there’s one big question on the minds of those who are looking to see who emerges as the party’s next standard bearer. Two, actually: Where is Joe? Where is Kamala?\n\nBoth Democrats who ran for president in 2024 have largely dropped off the face of the earth since that disastrous November drubbing at the hands of Donald Trump. Joe Biden gave his first big speech since leaving office on Tuesday — he appeared tired, and stumbled through his speech at times, and couldn’t attack Trump by name. His address did not touch on the administration’s deportations.\n\nWith his political career behind him, however, few are expecting a fiery Biden to emerge to rally the troops.\n\nIt’s Kamala Harris whose silence is more surprising. Despite her well-reported future political ambitions, the ex-vice president has not said a word about Abrego Garcia on social media, has largely ceased holding public events for the time being, and has had nothing to say about the “constitutional crisis” which her former peers in Congress now say the US faces. Once again, Harris finds herself at the center of accusations that her party’s sense of urgency does not meet its own rhetoric.\n\nWith Democratic groups pressing ahead full-steam in the effort to build “the Resistance” 2.0 and fight the shocking scale of changes Donald Trump is seeking to make to the federal government, Harris could find herself left behind and accused of checking out if she seeks to rebuild a brand as a leader of her party if she’s eyeing 2028 — or if she runs for governor of California next year.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/democrats-lost-unity-around-fighting-001422195.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/27c75981ad5c211f434fa7b144c9be57","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 00:14:22","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.081},{"id":311935156,"title":"Trump’s biggest critics in Congress are raking in a ton of dough","text":"Some of the most outspoken Democratic critics of President Donald Trump’s reckless and dangerous agenda were also this quarter’s biggest fundraising winners.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, one of the country’s most prominent progressives, pulled in a staggering $9.6 million in the first three months of 2025, more than doubling her previous high of $4.4 million, set during summer 2020. \n\nThe surge reflects Ocasio-Cortez’s rising influence as the Democratic Party grapples with how to confront Trumpism while also navigating calls for generational change. She’s been crisscrossing the country with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, drawing large crowds—even in deep-red states. According to her campaign manager, 64% of her first-quarter donors were first-time contributors.\n\n“The people are sending Democrats a message about the direction they would like to see,” Faiz Shakir, a Sanders’ adviser and a former candidate to lead the Democratic National Committee, wrote on X in response to the news.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders, who isn’t up for reelection until 2030 and hasn’t said whether he’ll run again, raised an eye-popping $11.5 million this quarter.\n\nOther prominent Trump critics posted similarly strong numbers. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, also not up again until 2030, brought in $8.0 million.\n\nTexas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, who’s gained national attention for grilling Republicans like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Elon Musk, raised over $1.6 million—more than doubling her previous record of $863,000. It’s also the first time she’s hit a seven-figure quarterly haul.\n\nFellow Texas Democrat Al Green, who was censured after protesting Trump’s lie-filled speech to Congress in March, raised $359,000, more than doubling his previous record of $167,000.\n\nAnd in preparing for a bruising fight next year, Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia pulled in over $11.1 million this past quarter—a sum his campaign is touting as a first-quarter record for an incumbent in a nonelection year. The race in the Peach State is still taking shape, with Republicans increasingly desperate to find a candidate capable of challenging the popular Democrat.\n\nThe message from Democratic donors is simple: Stand up to Trump, and they’ll have your back. A new Civiqs poll for Daily Kos finds that just 46% of registered voters approve of Trump’s job performance, while 53% disapprove. According to the survey, voters are particularly concerned about his reckless tariffs driving up prices and his administration’s recent high-profile blunders. So it’s no surprise that some of the most vocal anti-Trump Democrats are among the biggest first-quarter fundraisers.\n\nThat momentum could carry into the next quarter, especially for those who’ve made waves recently, like Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, whose fiery floor speech came after the first-quarter deadline.\n\nThat said, many Republicans posted big numbers too. While Democrats outpaced GOP House candidates overall, Republican Senate candidates outraised their Democratic counterparts. The National Republican Congressional Committee reported a record $36.7 million raised in the first quarter of 2025, with $23.9 million cash on hand as it fights to protect the House majority.\n\nVulnerable House Republicans also performed well in fundraising. Four of the seven GOP incumbents—Reps. Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, Jen Kiggans of Virginia, Mike Lawler of New York, and Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa—each raised over $1 million this part quarter. These lawmakers are all running in toss-up districts, as defined by the nonpartisan election prognosticator Inside Elections.\n\nOther top GOP fundraisers included House Speaker Mike Johnson, who brought in $3.2 million, and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who raised $1.2 million in a district Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris narrowly carried in 2024.\n\nIn the Senate, some Republicans posted strong numbers, too. Sen. Thom Tillis, expected to face a tough race in 2026, raised $2.2 million and has over $4 million in the bank. Sen. Susan Collins, a frequent Trump critic who still largely votes with her party, brought in about $842,000. \n\nBut of course, Republicans have the world’s richest person in their corner. Megabillionaire Elon Musk has personally donated to nearly two dozen GOP congressional candidates, according to CNN, including Greene and Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley.\n\nBut even without a tech mogul bankrolling their campaigns, progressive Democrats are holding their own—raising big money and showing the base is ready to rally behind those willing to fight.","summary":"Some of the most outspoken Democratic critics of President Donald Trump’s reckless and dangerous agenda were also this quarter’s biggest fundraising winners.\n\n\n\nRep.

On Monday, a Maryland jury found Salvadoran illegal immigrant Victor Antonio Martinez-Hernandez guilty of the rape and murder of Rachel Morin, a 37-year-old mother of five from Bel Air. The other story involves Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant who a U.S. district judge ruled the Trump administration deported illegally to El Salvador. However, viewers of ABC, NBC, and CBS are likely only aware of the second story. According to a new NewsBusters study, the three broadcast networks have spent zero – zero! – seconds covering the Morin case. Meanwhile, over the past two weeks, they have spent more than 64 minutes covering Garcia, whom they largely refer to as a \"Maryland man.\" \"Disgusting,\" Donald Trump Jr. called the disparity in coverage. And we all know the reason why. The heinous killing of Morin emphasizes the danger in which Joe Biden's mindless open-border policy put Americans. In fact, Morin's family and family attorney both called out the Biden administration this week for its negligence. \"They caught him… three times at the border,\" the attorney said. \"I'm very angry, I'm actually outraged ... There was no action on the Democrat Party in any way. From Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Mayorkas…none of the [Maryland] Senators did anything to help search for the murderer of my daughter,\" Morin's mother told Fox News. Apparently, the broadcast networks didn't find the mother's comments worthy of a mention. Conversely, the networks see Garcia's deportation as an opportunity to frame Trump as evil and inhumane. The report also noted the networks neglected to focus on several details related to Garcia – such as his suspected gang affiliations, the details of his 2019 arrest, and the credible evidence linking him to MS-13. Put simply, the networks are not trying to report on illegal immigration honestly or even accurately. They have an agenda. Mentioning Rachel Morin makes Trump's border policy look good. Framing the Garcia story the way the networks have makes Trump look bad. And thus, expect the disparate coverage of the two Maryland illegal immigration cases to continue.","summary":"ABC, NBC, CBS won&apos;t mention Rachel Morin case but spend segment after segment on Abrego Garcia.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/abc-nbc-cbs-wont-mention-rachel-morin-case-spent-segment-after-segment-kilmar-garcia","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-2210617513.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 00:00:45","author":"Bobby Burack","authors":["Bobby Burack"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.478}]}
