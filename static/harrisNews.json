They’ve killed U.S. service members while altering critical shipping routes, leading to delays and, ultimately, higher prices of goods worldwide. \n\nNational security adviser Michael Waltz then put together a group chat on an encrypted app called Signal. Whether Waltz himself put together the chat and maintained the invite list is unclear (midlevel managers have assistants who take care of these things in the corporate world). Many of President Donald Trump’s top Cabinet members were invited to the discussion, including Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, among others. \n\nGoldberg, a vehement anti-Trump editor for a vehemently anti-Trump magazine, received what’s called a connection request from Waltz, indicating the two hadn’t spoken before on this particular app. From there, Goldberg was privy to plans of attacks on the Houthis set to launch on March 15 but did not report on his unintended access until after the fact. \n\nGoldberg, in a piece published Monday, claimed that “war plans” were included in the discussion. He has since posted a screenshot of what Hegseth sent, which includes which assets would be launched for attack at what times. In the wrong hands, this information could put American lives at risk. The fact that any reporter or editor was accidentally invited to a discussion like this is patently careless and embarrassing. No amount of spin changes that. \n\nIt is certain Trump was not pleased about the incident after a string of favorable news cycles around dropping gas and grocery prices. Last week, two stranded astronauts splashed down in the Gulf of America to much fanfare, thanks to the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s SpaceX. \n\nThen, there were the U.S. missions against the Houthis themselves, which were and continue to be enormously successful, while Trump showed a clear commitment to differ from Team Biden’s limp responses and to get important shipping lanes open again. \n\nThe Signal fumble is overshadowing everything, at least for now. But the feeling here is that this story will largely be gone by the end of the week. Here are a few reasons why: \n\nWe live in a world that requires instant communication. Some of the aforementioned members of the Trump Cabinet were in several different places where a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF, was not available. Vance was traveling to Michigan for an economic event, while Ukraine envoy Steve Witkoff, who was also in the chat, was in Moscow. \n\nNote: SCIFs are bulky and inconvenient. Communication and chats by an app like Signal are infinitely more convenient (almost too convenient). Here’s betting that Biden administration officials also used Signal to hold chats like this since the Signal app was installed on devices and agency computers when Trump officials took office, meaning it was already being used. \n\nMessages referenced in Goldberg’s piece also show Trump Cabinet members talking about switching to what are called “high side” classified systems, showing they knew the difference between an unclassified chat and secure communication for more sensitive content.\n\nTo be clear, this is not a justification for what happened. It cannot occur again, and it would be career suicide for anyone who initiated or joined a chat like this. \n\nBut apparently, Signal use among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle is common. Here’s the new AOC, Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX), talking about Signal just this past weekend during a speech in Washington, D.C.: \n\n“We have all these Signal chats,” she said before the Goldberg story broke. “If you don’t have Signal, get on Signal, OK? Do not trust — get on Signal!” \n\nHere’s another reason why the legs on this story may not be what Democrats hope they’ll be: \n\nJames Comey. \n\nIt was Comey in 2016, just a few months before Election Day, who provided a get-out-of-jail-free card for this behavior when he didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton for her highly classified emails sitting on an unsecured server while secretary of state. \n\nOnce that decision by the FBI director was made, all bets were off moving forward. It served as a permission slip that these actions were wrong, sure, but merely a light-slap-on-the-wrist wrong. \n\nBy the way, the same people screaming for Trump officials to resign also excused Joe Biden’s handling of classified documents by leaving them next to his Corvette in a garage at one of his Delaware homes. \n\nSit this one out, folks. The selective outrage is obvious. \n\nNow, all of that said, if the shoes were on other feet and this happened with Kamala Harris as vice president, Tony Blinken as secretary of state, and Jake Sullivan as national security adviser holding a chat in such a manner, Republicans would surely be demanding resignations as well … that’s just the way it works now. \n\nAnd that’s the point: When Democrats complained that egg and grocery prices were too high under Trump just days after he took office, it had zero punch because they excused the same thing under Biden. \n\nSo when Democrats, CNN, and MSNBC pundits lecture about the importance of national security, it falls almost completely on deaf ears after so many defended the Afghanistan withdrawal that saw 13 U.S. service members killed, which resulted in exactly zero firings and no accountability.\n\nExcusing an open border that has allowed hundreds, if not thousands, of terrorists into the country also doesn’t help their argument now. \n\nFor his part, Trump has stuck by Waltz so far.“I don’t think he should apologize,” the president said. “I think he’s doing his best. It’s equipment and technology that’s not perfect.”“And, probably, he won’t be using it again, at least not in the very near future,” he added.One gets the feeling, however, that if anything like this happens again, there won’t be a third strike for Waltz. \n\nFinally, there is Goldberg’s past work that needs to be highlighted when it comes to credibility. \n\nIn 2018, Goldberg wrote an Atlantic piece titled, “Trump: Americans Who Died in War Are ‘Losers’ and ‘Suckers.’”\n\n“The president has repeatedly disparaged the intelligence of service members, and asked that wounded veterans be kept out of military parades,” he added, citing “multiple sources” who predictably all stayed anonymous. \n\nThe story came after poor weather canceled both a flight and a ceremony at Aisne-Marne American Cemetery outside of Paris. But Trump didn’t refuse anything. A total of 21 members of his team, including then-national security adviser John Bolton, went on the record to deny Trump ever made such a rancid comment while pointing to weather conditions for canceling the event, something Trump had no say in on foreign soil.\n\n“I don’t know who told the author that, but that was false,” Bolton said at the time.\n\n“What animal would say such a thing?” Trump asked in response to the story.\n\nIn 2024, not long before the election, Goldberg, again through only unnamed sources, wrote a piece claiming Trump, during his first term, had become angry over a $60,000 bill received for Texas soldier Vanessa Guillen because of her ethnicity. \n\n“It doesn’t cost 60,000 bucks to bury a f***ing Mexican,” Goldberg alleges Trump said in December 2020. “Don’t pay it!”\n\nMayra Guillen, Vanessa’s sister, posted on X to slam Goldberg, accusing him of exploiting her death for political purposes while criticizing the report. \n\n“I don’t appreciate how you are exploiting my sister’s death for politics- hurtful & disrespectful to the important changes she made for service members,” she replied to the Atlantic’s X feed. “President Donald Trump did nothing but show respect to my family & Vanessa. In fact, I voted for President Trump today.”\n\n“My sister’s death was never to be politicized,” she added. “Unbelievable.”\n\nYou followed that correctly: Goldberg claims that four years after the alleged funeral payment refusal happened, “sources” suddenly came to him, and only him right before the 2024 election, and relayed what they say Trump said. \n\nWe talk about stories that move the needle in politics all the time. \n\nThis is not one of those times … thanks to precedent, hypocrisy, partisanship, and a journalist who was shown not to be trusted. \n\nOh, and most importantly, thanks to a successful military campaign against a terrorist organization that has received a free pass for far too long.","summary":"Call it the first gift to the Democratic Party by the Trump administration after the first 70 days of relatively smooth sailing and chalking up win after win since taking office.&#160; The gift?

So, too are Oprah Winfrey, Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom, Gayle King, Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian and Jewel.\n\nTMZ also reported that Trump’s daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, made the cut, as did Ivanka Trump’s in-laws: Jared Kushner’s brother Joshua Kushner, and his supermodel wife Karlie Klaus.\n\nTMZ sources furthermore revealed that fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg and her husband Barry Diller have been invited, which seems fair, given that the couple hosted a lavish, star-studded engagement party for Bezos and Sanchez at their Beverly Hills mansion in the fall. Others on the guest list include film producer Brian Grazer and models Brooks Nader and Camila Morrone.\n\nBut to some observers of the national mood, Winfrey, Longoria, Kardashian, Perry and the others could be accused of failing to “read the room,” oblivious to growing national anger against a growing oligarchy and America’s “move toward authoritarianism,” as Sanders said in a speech on the Senate floor in February.\n\nThe Vermont senator talked about the growing divide between two Americas, amid increasing income and wealth inequality. At the very top are the relatively few “oligarchs,” who include Bezos and other tech titans such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, who view themselves as “modern-day kings” — which would make Sanchez a would-be “queen.”\n\nSanders said that together, Bezos, Musk and Zuckerberg are worth a combined $903 billion and own more than the bottom half of American society — $170 million.\n\n“What we NOW have is an ideology being pushed by the oligarchs which says that as very, very wealthy people — often self-made, often the masters of revolutionary new technology and as ‘high-IQ individuals,’ it is THEIR absolute right to rule,” Sanders said.\n\nWhen it comes to Bezos and Sanchez, they effectively embraced Trump’s leadership by participating in a pretty stunning bit of stagecraft at the polarizing new president’s inauguration, which arguably served both Trump’s interests and their own. They stood in an honored position in the U.S. Capitol with Musk, Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook and other business leaders in what The Guardian called a display of the “oligarchy” and the powerful influence they expect “to wield” in Trump’s America.\n\nBezos and Sanchez has been especially demonstrative in being friendly with Trump — which should seem shocking and disturbing to their famous liberal friends. That is, unless they, too, want to be part of Bezos and Sanchez’s new in-crowd.\n\nAfter Trump’s election, the couple joined Musk for dinner with Donald and Melania Trump at Mar-a-Lago, with Trump boasting, “In this term, everybody wants to be my friend.” The night before Trump’s inauguration, Bezos and Sanchez also attended what Sanchez hailed as “a magical evening” — a candlelight dinner honoring Trump, where they got to schmooze with such MAGA figures as Musk and Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.\n\nWinfrey, Longoria and Perry were among Bezos and Sanchez’s friends who were very outspoken in their opposition to Trump getting a second term — and the danger they said he posed to American democracy. While speaking at a campaign rally on behalf of Vice President Kamala Harris, Winfrey warned that the country stood on “precipice of danger,” with Trump poised to usher in an authoritarian regime if elected. Meanwhile, Longoria has said that America would become such a “scary place” under Trump that she was happy to be living outside the United States.\n\nBut Winfrey may experience of serious case of “FOMO” if she turns down an invitation to Bezos’ and Sanchez’s wedding of the year. So, too, would Longoria, Perry, Gayle King and the morally flexible Kris Jenner and Kim Kardashian.\n\nNotably, Longoria has shown a willingness to turn a blind eye to concerns expressed by Sanders and others that Bezos and his oligarchic brethren “will sacrifice, without hesitation, the well-being of working people to protect their privilege.”\n\nLast year, the longtime activist praised Bezos and Sanchez for their “courage and civility” after she received a $50 million prize from them, supposedly to be shared with nonprofits of her choice. Earlier this month, she included Sanchez in the “badass” women she celebrated in an Instagram post for International Women’s Day.\n\nMeanwhile, King and Perry are set to join Sanchez in another splashy PR opportunity, possibly before the splashy wedding: an all-female trip to space on one of Bezos’s Blue Origin rockets.","summary":"Others stars who could help Bezos and Sanchez use their wedding as a display of their wealth and cultural clout in Trump's America include Eva Longoria, Katy Perry and Gayle King.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/03/26/oligarchs-wedding-jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-celebrity-guest-list/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SanchezBezos1.jpg?w=1024&h=705","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 23:39:45","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.491},{"id":304548656,"title":"White House Blasts Atlantic, 'Anti-Trump' Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg over 'Sensationalized' Signal Story","text":"WASHINGTON–White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt blasted the Atlantic and its editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, during Wednesday’s press briefing, while addressing Goldberg’s “sensationalized story” on Signal communications between Cabinet officials.\n\nLeavitt remarked on Goldberg’s story, in which he contended Cabinet officials “accidentally” shared “war plans” with him about Houthi strikes in Yemen after he was added to a group chat between them on Signal.\n\n“This administration is working hard on behalf of the American public every day, but the mainstream media continues to be focused on a sensationalized story from the failing Atlantic magazine that is falling apart by the hour,” she wrote.\n\nIn a follow-up piece publishing the Signal messages on Wednesday morning, Goldberg tweaked his framing, calling them “attack plans” in a joint byline with Atlantic national security and intelligence staff writer Shane Harris.\n\nLeavitt reiterated the White House’s stance that there was no classified material shared in the message thread.\n\n“There were no locations, no sources or methods revealed, and there were certainly no war plans discussed,” she said. “The Atlantic has even admitted this themselves. Their release of these internal messages validates the truth, which we have been saying all along.”\n\nLeavitt also teed off on Goldberg specifically, noting he and his wife, Pamela Reeves, are registered Democrats:\n\nThere’s arguably no one in the media who loves manufacturing and pushing hoaxes more than Jeffrey Goldberg. Goldberg is an anti-Trump hater. He is a registered Democrat. Goldberg’s wife is also a registered Democrat and a big Democrat donor who used to work under, who? Hillary Clinton.\n\nReeves notably worked for then-Secretary of State Clinton as director of the International Fund for Women and Girls in the State Department. According to Federal Election Commission records, a “Pamela Reeves” of Washington, DC, has contributed over $24,000 to Democrats since May 2016.\n\nLeavitt argued that Goldberg has repeatedly “discredited himself” with his reporting throughout his career:\n\nThis is the same Jeffrey Goldberg who infamously lied about weapons of mass destruction to get us into the Iraq War, which cost trillions of dollars and thousands of American soldiers. And how else has Goldberg discredited himself? By absurdly claiming that President Trump was Vladimir Putin during the 2016 campaign, by peddling the Russia Russia Russia hoax that tried to hijack President Trump’s first term, by inventing the suckers and losers hoax to help Joe Biden in the 2020 election, by peddling a hoax about President Trump involving Gold Star families to help Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, which our campaign, at the time, vigorously denied. Jeffrey Goldberg didn’t care.\n\nLeavitt also reiterated that the White House Counsel’s Office and the National Security Council said they are looking into how Goldberg “was inadvertently added” to the chat.","summary":"WASHINGTON–White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt blasted the Atlantic and its editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, during Wednesday's press briefing, while addressing Goldberg's \"sensationalized story\" on Signal communications between Cabinet officials.\n\n\nThe post White House Blasts Atlantic, &#8216;Anti-Trump&#8217; Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg over &#8216;Sensationalized&#8217; Signal Story appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/03/26/white-house-blasts-atlantic-anti-trump-editor-in-chief-jeffrey-goldberg-over-sensationalized-signal-story/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/03/Jeffrey-Goldberg-640x335.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 23:19:35","author":"Nick Gilbertson","authors":["Nick Gilbertson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.254},{"id":304541102,"title":"Johnson kicks off 2026 cycle with $11 million donation to House Republicans","text":"The remaining $1.9 million was directed toward non-incumbent GOP candidates, state parties, and other GOP committees, such as the Republican National Committee.\n\nJohnson said in a statement to the Washington Examiner that the investments will help “make sure our team is ready to defy history and win again in 2026.”\n\n“House Republicans are fired up and on offense to kick off the 2026 cycle,” Johnson said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “While House Democrats have no message, no leader, and no vision, we are working to deliver on our America First agenda and get the resources our members and candidates will need to defend and grow our majority.”\n\nThe last five presidents have all had periods where both the House and the Senate were controlled by their party, but most lasted just two years before one of the chambers flipped to the opposition.\n\nThe last time Republicans held a trifecta was during President Donald Trump’s first term, from 2017 to 2019. During that time, one of the crowning achievements of his administration was the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and Republicans are moving quickly to try and use the first two years of Trump’s second term to renew the tax cuts and pass more of his agenda before Judgment Day on Nov. 3, 2026.\n\nRepublican leaders have acknowledged that the failure of trifectas, including theirs, is waiting until the last two years of an administration to make a significant change. Historically, the House flips to the party opposite the White House in the midterm elections as the party’s high favor with voters begins to fade with each passing week due to contentious legislation, infighting, or executive actions by the president.\n\nJohnson and NRCC Chairman Richard Hudson (R-NC) have been insistent since their wins in the 2024 election that they are “on offense” for 2026, despite Democrats only needing a net gain of three seats to take the majority. Three Republicans — Reps. Mike Lawler (R-NY), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), and Don Bacon (R-NE) — represent districts that former Vice President Kamala Harris won in 2024, and Republicans are quick to point to the 13 districts won by Trump but represented by a Democrat as proof they are in the driver’s seat.\n\nEyes will be on the speaker to see whether he can continue to fill the large fundraising shoes of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who was a powerhouse when it came to raising money and defending incumbents. With a razor-thin majority, Johnson cannot afford to lose any incumbents to Democratic challengers in 2026.\n\nJohnson, who first became speaker in October 2023 after McCarthy’s historic ouster, quelled concerns about his fundraising prowess in the crucial 2024 cycle. He set quarterly fundraising records while traversing more than 250 cities across 40 states during the 2024 election cycle.\n\nIn January, Johnson launched the updated version of the “Grow the Majority” Joint Fundraising Committee. It includes more than 70 Republican entities with a maximum contribution of more than $1 million. \n\nOther Republicans announced donations this week. Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) donated $1.3 million to the NRCC and $2 million for candidates, members, and the NRCC. Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) donated $2 million to candidates and $3 million for the NRCC. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) announced a $500,000 transfer to the NRCC, as well.\n\nThe influx of cash comes ahead of the Florida special elections to fill the seats of former Rep. Matt Gaetz and national security adviser Mike Waltz. GOP leaders have raised concerns about Republican candidates being outpaced in fundraising by the millions by their Democratic challengers. \n\nGaetz’s seat in the 1st Congressional District and Waltz’s seat in the 6th District were both won by the two men by more than 30 percentage points.

Gavin Newsom is sniping at the progressive shibboleths he once promulgated so proudly.\n\nIn the Senate, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer rejected calls from his left flank to shut down the federal government rather than let a Republican-backed funding bill pass.\n\nAnd across the country, swing-state lawmakers like Michigan Sen.

Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are crisscrossing the country to expound a very different explanation of the Democrats’ woes — and to promote a very different corrective.\n\nSanders had harsh words for the Democrats this month, calling the party “heavily dominated by the billionaire class, run by consultants who are way out of touch with reality.”\n\n“The Democratic Party has virtually no grassroots support,” he declared.\n\nAOC, too, slammed her party at a Las Vegas rally last week.\n\n“We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us,” she complained.\n\n“We as a community must choose and vote for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class.”\n\nSo which is it?\n\nDo Democrats need to lurch even further to the left in the name of “fighting Trump” — or is that what’s consigned them to their unenviable position?\n\nAvailable evidence suggests it’s the latter.\n\nPolls ahead of November’s presidential election found that 47% of likely voters believed 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris was “too liberal or progressive,” while just 6% said she wasn’t “liberal or progressive enough.”\n\nThat hasn’t changed in the months since: A new survey released by Echelon Insights this month revealed that 42% of Democrats think the party should move “to the center” — and only 20% want it to move “to the left.”\n\nBut just because the answer is obvious doesn’t mean party leaders will recognize as much.\n\nIn fact, they’re all but certain to do the opposite.\n\nToday’s Democratic Party is built on the proposition that it stands on the right side of history, pushing humanity toward progress while battling backward, bigoted opponents.\n\nFor a long time, that messaging has served as a powerful recruitment tool, particularly for younger, idealistic Americans searching for meaning — and for an easier path into elite progressive-dominated political, media and academic circles.\n\nBut now we see the drawbacks to this smug self-conception.\n\nOver the long term, it has spawned a radicalization that first offended the sensibilities of the median voter, then pushed them into the arms of a pugilistic champion: Trump.\n\nWorse yet, the nature of the Democrats’ messaging makes it nearly impossible for them to walk back any of their unpopular ideas.\n\nThey were on the right side of history, they declared, when they manufactured a crisis at the southern border.\n\nThey were on the right side of history when they insisted that not only could men become women, such men must be allowed to compete in women’s sports and enter their most intimate spaces.\n\nThey were on the right side of history when they waged a holy war on fossil fuels.\n\nThey were on the right side of history when they proposed a massive wealth transfer to their voter base in the form of a student loan “forgiveness” program, and on and on.\n\nTo propose moderation now is to betray a righteous cause — and to shatter the carefully cultivated self-image that provides meaning to so many in the Democratic activist class.\n\nThat’s why the mainstream Biden campaign gave way to the militantly leftist Biden administration.\n\nThat’s why it’s the likes of pugnacious Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett — and not Slotkin, or Pennsylvania’s gadfly Sen. John Fetterman — who is being hailed as the future of the party.\n\nAnd if you parse the moderates’ words carefully, you’ll find that theirs isn’t an ideological objection to the progressives’ vision, but a tactical one.\n\n“My district is very different than Alexandria’s district,” Slotkin said soothingly last week, immediately after belittling AOC’s lack of anti-Trump accomplishments. “So I don’t fault her for doing what she thinks is right for them.”\n\nSchumer, for his part, has lashed out at fellow Dems like Nancy Pelosi only to cling to his personal power — not to set his party on a fresh course.\n\nSo if the much-anticipated Democratic civil war breaks out at all, there’s no question about who will prevail: One side has already laid down their arms.\n\nIsaac Schorr is a staff writer at Mediaite.","summary":"The nature of the Democratic party's messaging makes it nearly impossible for them to walk back any of their unpopular ideas.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/26/opinion/in-democrats-looming-civil-war-one-side-is-already-doomed/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/sen-bernie-sanders-i-vt-100896348_00e046.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/YEqW5JeD-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-26 22:31:56","author":"Isaac Schorr","authors":["Isaac Schorr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.225},{"id":304503662,"title":"Noem looks to scrap FEMA and eliminate funding for emergency prep and long-term rebuilding","text":"The Trump administration wants to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), reportedly aiming to end its role in funding long-term rebuilding efforts after disaster and seeding communities with funds to prepare emergencies.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees the agency, discussed the administration’s plans during a Tuesday meeting with FEMA officials and Corey Lewandowksi, E&E News reports.\n\nOfficials are looking to rebrand FEMA, put some of its functions under White House control, and narrow the federal role in disaster response to immediate life-saving and providing emergency supplies, while funding states to carry out their own expanded disaster operations.\n\n“We are grateful the press is covering Secretary Noem’s efforts to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse within the Department of Homeland Security,” a DHS spokesperson said in response to the outlet’s reporting.\n\nNoem said during a Monday cabinet meeting the administration is going to “eliminate” FEMA.\n\nShortly after taking office, the Trump administration created a council to review FEMA’s operations, though it hasn’t met.\n\nThe White House has also reportedly ordered FEMA to review “all disaster relief programs that may indirectly or incidentally aid illegal aliens,” according to an internal memo obtained by Politico.\n\nThe Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency program, meanwhile, has already reportedly cut or frozen tens of millions of dollars in anti-terrorism grants administered through the Department of Homeland Security, FEMA’s parent agency, and other agencies.\n\nThe administration has criticized FEMA from a number of angles, ranging from arguments that it’s inefficient, to inaccurate claims the agency diverted emergency funding to house migrants.\n\n“I love Oklahoma, but you know what? If they get hit with a tornado or something, let Oklahoma fix it,” Trump said in January. “And then the federal government can help them out with the money. FEMA is getting in the way of everything.”\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump also falsely claimed then-Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden didn’t visit the disaster zones in North Carolina after Hurricane Helene, and that the federal government didn’t help people in Republican-leaning areas.\n\nThe president has long taken an interest in disaster response, and moving FEMA’s functions to the White House could potentially invite further politicization of disaster aid.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to cut off disaster funds to fire-prone California if their Democratic governor, long-time Trump critic Gavin Newsom, doesn’t go along with various priorities.\n\nWhen fires broke out around Los Angeles earlier this year, Trump and his allies repeatedly suggested without evidence that diversity, equity, and inclusion policies were to blame for the ensuing disaster, while the president made inaccurate comments about the source of much of Southern California’s water.\n\nThe administration then signed an executive order it claimed would release water from upstream reservoirs to bring more water to the south of the state for fighting fires, though experts said much of the water would go to agriculture and not reach the L.A. area, a mismatch which Army Corps of Engineers officials reportedly were aware of but rushed to comply with the presidential order anyway.","summary":"Government could move FEMA functions to White House under administration’s plans","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kristie-noem-fema-disaster-funding-b2722213.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/16/19/Hurricane_Helene_FEMA_Threats_48350.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wASpHyWI-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-26 20:28:50","author":"The Independent","authors":["The Independent"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.059},{"id":304514386,"title":"Atlantic story on Yemen chat reportedly showed a rare time Vance broke with Trump","text":"Amid the fallout from The Atlantic's Monday article reportedly detailing the Signal group chat discussing the U.S. attack on Houthis in Yemen, Vice President JD Vance appearing to break with President Donald Trump is also getting attention.\n\nVance made a noteworthy statement in the chat, appearing to break with Trump and questioning whether the president recognized that a unilateral U.S. attack on the Houthis to keep international shipping lanes open was at odds with his tough talk about European nations paying their share of such efforts, according to an account by Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic editor-in-chief who said he was inadvertently included in the conversation.\n\n\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" Vance wrote in the chat, according to Goldberg. \"There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"\n\nOn the day before the attack, according to The Atlantic's reporting published on Monday, Vance participated in the chat as he told the group he was traveling to Michigan for an economic event.\n\n\"Team, I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan. But I think we are making a mistake,\" Vance wrote in the chat, according to Goldberg. \"3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.\"\n\nUltimately, he supported the attack, telling Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, “if you think we should do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again,” according to Goldberg's account.\n\nThe White House has insisted the communications in the group chat were not war plans and criticized The Atlantic journalist who detailed the account.\n\n\"This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X on Wednesday.\n\nWilliam Martin, Vance's communications director, said the vice president and Trump \"are in complete agreement.\"\n\n“The Vice President’s first priority is always making sure that the President’s advisers are adequately briefing him on the substance of their internal deliberations. Vice President Vance unequivocally supports this administration’s foreign policy. The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement,” he said in a statement.\n\nAsked if Vance and Trump had spoken between the time Vance raised his concerns with the group, as reported by The Atlantic, and he concurred with those advocating to go ahead with the strike, a spokesperson for Vance said the statement Martin provided to ABC News made it clear that they did, pointing out the line that they had “subsequent conversations about this matter.”\n\nThe comments from Vance are striking, given that he has been in lockstep, at least in public, with Trump, his top defender most of the time since being chosen as his running mate last July.\n\nNo situation depicted that more than Trump and Vance's Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this month, where the three men got into a shouting match in front of the media over the prospects of a ceasefire deal to end the war in Ukraine. Vance berated Zelenskyy for not being thankful for the support the U.S. has provided Ukraine.\n\n\"Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media,\" Vance said to Zelenskyy. \"Right now, you guys are going around enforcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.\"\n\nDuring the campaign cycle, where Vance was the policy attack dog for the president and previously said that Trump needs a vice president who wouldn't \"stab\" him in the back, there was only a handful of times he deviated from Trump on policy, with the most notable incident occurring in an NBC interview during the presidential campaign when he said Trump would veto a national abortion ban. A few weeks later, Trump, during his debate with Kamala Harris hosted by ABC News, was asked about Vance's comments on an abortion ban.\n\n\"Well, I didn't discuss it with JD, in all fairness,\" Trump said.\n\nSince then, Vance has been more careful not to deviate publicly from the president's policy position.\n\nFollowing their victory in November, a source close to Vance told ABC News that the vice president was tasked to ensure that all of the priorities of the Trump administration move forward and would work on any of the issues Trump needs him to further.\n\nIn November, a source familiar with Vance and Trump's relationship said Vance was focused on doing whatever was needed to support the president-elect and the administration.","summary":"JD Vance made a noteworthy statement in the Signal chat, breaking with Donald Trump and questioning if the attacks on the Houthis in Yemen should be delayed.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/atlantic-story-yemen-chat-reportedly-showed-rare-instance/story?id=120139751","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/f9778a8f-4045-4ddc-9a98-7856d0974e0b/jd-vance-1-rt-gmh-250325_1742926672729_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 20:25:36","author":"Hannah Demissie","authors":["Hannah Demissie"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.05},{"id":304510640,"title":"David M. Drucker: Reagan Republicans didn’t disappear. They were just demoted.","text":"Over the last decade, it’s become commonplace to describe President Donald Trump’s takeover of the Republican Party as hostile — as if the one-time New York real estate mogul was the political version of a corporate raider. That’s a gross mischaracterization, one that has contributed to a misunderstanding of the source of Trump’s hypnotic influence over the GOP.\n\nTrump managed to upend the party because, long before he announced his first bid for president in June 2015, there was a robust faction of conservative populists inside the GOP yearning for a figure just like him. Populists who preferred a street fighter to a statesman; a domestic industrialist to a free trader; a quasi-isolationist to an internationalist. All they needed was a champion who could also appeal to enough Republican voters to win a presidential primary.\n\nTrump’s takeover rebalanced power within the Republican governing coalition. The populists, long the junior partner, rose to take command, and the Ronald Reagan Republicans, for years the controlling bloc, found themselves demoted. Even after all this time, they find it disconcerting.\n\n“I feel a bit politically homeless at times,” Republican operative Mike DuHaime told me. DuHaime runs a public relations firm in New Jersey and is a longtime adviser to Chris Christie, the Republican former Garden State governor who challenged Trump for the 2024 nomination. He concedes never voting for Trump but emphasized his continued support for the party down-ticket. His biggest gripe with the GOP’s new (populist) establishment?\n\n“I never agreed with the party on everything, but there was some tolerance of differences of opinion from leaders in the party. Not so much anymore,” DuHaime said. “I find myself agreeing with Trump on some stuff and disagreeing on others. But there’s a purity test now. It’s sad to see so many people twist themselves into pretzels to comply with whatever Trump says.”\n\nKevin Madden, who spent years in Republican politics, first as a congressional aide and later as an adviser to 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, said feeling the party transform beneath his feet has been “humbling.”\n\n“When you spend years working as a staffer in Congress, and then years working on political campaigns, it’s a seven-days-a-week, 18-hours-a-day lifestyle. That amount of time and devotion can lead you to convince yourself that you know everything about the party,” explained Madden, now a government relations executive in Washington, DC. “The party shift since 2006 to where it is today has been an education.”\n\nThere’s a misperception, especially among MAGA activists, that center-right opposition to the president equals “Never Trump.” But in dozens of conversations I had with Republican primary voters in 2024 on the campaign trail for The Dispatch, and in regular discussions I have about Trump and the state of the party with GOP operatives, I’ve discovered more nuanced views of the president.\n\nAfter 10 years of Trump dominating American politics, everyone is familiar with the aspects of the president’s personal comportment and policy agenda that can cause some Republicans heartburn. Who knows; Trump’s expansive use of tariffs and belligerent treatment of American allies overseas may yet reopen fissures with elements of the center-right that bedeviled the president in his first term and helped sink his 2020 reelection bid.\n\nBut there’s also plenty about Trump that Reagan Republicans like: tax cuts, deregulation, military spending and support for Israel, to name a few, not to mention his decision to let technology titan Elon Musk take a hatchet to the federal bureaucracy. And even when their public scolding of Trump makes them outcasts in their own party, they don’t feel any more welcome in the Democratic Party, which they believe veered too far to the left — culturally, economically and on some foreign policy matters — to even consider jumping ship.\n\n“While I love Liz Cheney and her courage, saying she was ‘proud’ to vote for Harris was dissonant to anti-Trump Republicans. What those Republicans would have identified with was that she hated that she had to vote for Harris,” said Rob Stutzman, a Republican operative in Sacramento, recalling how Cheney, a former Wyoming congresswoman who disowned Trump after the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, talked about her support for Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nIndeed, if Democrats are wondering how Trump won over Republicans who shunned him during his first term and in 2020, they need to look in the mirror, many Republicans, both voters and party insiders, have told me.\n\nThis anecdote from Stutzman, the rare Republican vocal about his opposition to Trump, was instructive: “When I was working with No Labels in hopes of recruiting a third (presidential) candidate, we would see in focus groups that GOP voters who didn’t like Trump were pushed to him by Biden. Biden, and then Harris, consolidated Republicans into Trump.”\n\n“There is no doubt to me that the Democratic party of the past decade completely fertilized the ground that allowed Trump to grow,” Stutzman added. “I blame them.”\n\nNeither Trump’s populist supporters nor the president’s displaced conservative skeptics are convinced the GOP’s current power dynamic is irrevocably locked in place. “It’s been a long fight; it continues every day,” Steven Bannon, a prominent Trump supporter — whose daily podcast, War Room, is ground zero for the president’s MAGA movement — told me during a recent telephone conversation. “I tell people: Don’t think we’ve ever won.”\n\nTim Chapman, veteran conservative activist and adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence, Trump’s running mate in 2016 and 2020, is engaged in that fight, hoping to contribute to a restoration of the Reagan wing of the GOP.\n\n“There’s a weakness to the national conservative populist position, which is that they really don’t have yet (ideological buy-in) across the board, but they have the power,” he told me recently.\n\n“The question is: Can they hold onto the power long enough to change rank and file voters’ opinions on what it means to be a conservative?”\n\nDavid M.

Being Listed in Donald Trump’s Travel Ban","text":"Donald Trump has reportedly proposed a travel ban on countries, which could impact nations set to compete in the 2026 FIFA World CupWith the tournament being co-hosted by the United States, Mexico, and Canada, restrictions could create complications for affected teamsFIFA may need to consider alternative solutions to ensure all qualified nations can participate without travel issues\n\nOne country may be barred from participating in the 2026 World Cup in the United States due to its inclusion on President Donald Trump’s proposed travel ban list. \n\nTrump, who returned to office as the 47th US President in January after defeating Kamala Harris in the election, has prioritised immigration policies, including suspending entry for undocumented immigrants. \n\nAccording to the New York Times, his administration has drafted a list of 43 countries facing various levels of travel restrictions, with the majority being African nations.\n\nThe list reportedly categorises countries into full visa bans, partial or strict visa suspensions, and nations given 60 days to address concerns before facing potential restrictions. \n\nMany of the fully banned nations have already been eliminated from World Cup qualifying, such as Afghanistan and North Korea. \n\nHowever, Iran, which recently secured qualification, is among the nations listed, potentially complicating their participation in the tournament.\n\nSeveral African nations still in World Cup contention—such as Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Burkina Faso—fall under the partial ban category. \n\nIn South America, Venezuela is the only country facing a full visa ban, potentially impacting their qualification hopes if they advance. \n\nCountries on Trump's proposed travel ban list?\n\nFull visa bans\n\nAfghanistan\n\nNorth Korea\n\nPartial visa suspensions\n\nEritrea (unranked by FIFA, having not played a game since January 2020)\n\nRussia (currently suspended by FIFA)\n\nSierra Leone\n\nSouth Sudan\n\nTurkmenistan\n\nCountries recommended for partial suspension (countries have 60 days to address concerns)\n\nAntigua and Barbuda\n\nBurkina Faso\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\n\nEquatorial Guinea\n\nRepublic of the Congo\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis\n\nSaint Lucia\n\nSao Tome and Principe\n\nWhat could FIFA do next?\n\nThe 2026 World Cup is not solely being hosted by the United States, as Mexico and Canada are also set to stage several matches. \n\nThis opens the possibility of a resolution that would allow nations affected by travel restrictions, such as Iran, to play their group-stage matches and beyond in either Mexico or Canada. \n\nHowever, there has been no official indication that FIFA is considering such an arrangement.\n\nWhile FIFA has yet to comment on any potential workarounds, similar adjustments could be explored to ensure that all qualified teams can participate in the tournament. \n\nHowever, it remains to be seen whether FIFA would be willing to relocate matches or implement alternative measures to accommodate affected nations.\n\nFIFA threatens to ban African country\n\nYEN.com,gh earlier reported that FIFA has warned an African nation that it could face suspension from international football and the 2026 World Cup due to government interference.\n\nThe football governing body issued an official letter, emphasising the need for the country’s football association to operate independently.\n\nSource: YEN.com.gh","summary":"One country may be barred

‘discredited’ Atlantic editor, says Elon Musk helping investigate Yemen strikes group chat","text":"WASHINGTON — White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt attacked Atlantic editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg as a” discredited,” “anti-Trump sensationalist reporter” Wednesday — and said Elon Musk had offered to help figure out how Goldberg was included in a recent administration group chat about airstrikes on Yemen.\n\nLeavitt attacked the journalist who revealed the embarrassing episode, which has spurred bipartisan concern about information security, as President Trump and his aides circled the wagons and refused to fire anyone involved to deny Democrats a “scalp.”\n\n“We are not going to bend in the face of this insincere outrage,” Leavitt said at her regular briefing, accusing “Democrats and the media” of backing “a coordinated campaign to try and sow chaos in this White House.”\n\nLeavitt focused on Goldberg as much of the day’s news coverage focused on national security adviser Mike Waltz, who added the well-known Trump critic to the group chat, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who insisted no classified information was shared, despite expert analysis to the contrary.\n\n“This is the same Jeffrey Goldberg who infamously lied about weapons of mass destruction to get us into the Iraq War, which cost trillions of dollars and thousands of American soldiers,” Leavitt said from the briefing room podium, with a screenshot of an article about Goldberg’s past advocacy behind her on a TV screen.\n\n“And how else has Goldberg discredited himself? … By peddling the ‘Russia, Russia, Russia’ hoax that tried to hijack President Trump’s first term, by inventing the ‘suckers and losers’ hoax to help Joe Biden in the 2020 election, by peddling a hoax about President Trump involving Gold Star families to help Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, which our campaign at the time vigorously denied. Jeffrey Goldberg didn’t care.”\n\nLeavitt added: “There’s more, but we don’t have all day, and we can now add the Signal hoax to this very long list. The real story here is the overwhelming success of President Trump’s decisive military action against Houthi terrorists.”\n\nThe press secretary did not mention that the lede of Goldberg’s bombshell 2020 report on Trump allegedly skipping a visit to a military cemetery in Paris in 2018 was debunked by a subsequent Freedom of Information Act release that proved the Navy made a “bad weather call” that prevented a helicopter flight.\n\nLeavitt called Signal, the encrypted app on which Trump’s leading officials communicated about airstrikes earlier this month, “an approved app for government use” and “the most safe and efficient way of communicating, especially when people can’t be in a [Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility].”\n\n“Democrat Senator Mark Warner is hysterical over the use of Signal, which is an approved decrypted app, in the killing of Houthi terrorists,’ she said. “But Senator Warner himself used Signal to work with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch to connect [with] the disgraced Steele dossier author who started the Russia hoax.”\n\nLeavitt was short on specifics about the investigation into Goldberg’s inclusion in the chat — saying that the White House counsel’s office and National Security Council were reviewing the matter without specifying which was taking the lead and how the findings would be known.\n\nMusk, the driving force behind the Department of Government Efficiency, “has offered to put his technical experts on this to figure out how [Goldberg’s] number was inadvertently added to the chat again — again to take responsibility and ensure this can never happen again,” she said.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth doubled down after the briefing on his insistence that no classified information was shared on the group chat, even after Goldberg published additional messages containing details of the mission.\n\n“There’s no units, no locations, no routes, no flight paths, no sources, no methods, no classified information,” Hegseth told reporters in Hawaii. “Nobody is texting war plans.”","summary":"The White House attacked the journalist who revealed the embarrassing episode, which has spurred bipartisan concern about information security, as President Trump and his aides circled the wagons to deny Democrats a \"scalp.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/26/us-news/karoline-leavitt-blasts-discredited-atlantic-editor-says-elon-musk-helping-investigate-yemen-strikes-group-chat/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/newspress-collage-pv4zxp4dd-1743013845175.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1742999447&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 19:55:38","author":"Diana Glebova,Steven Nelson","authors":["Diana Glebova","Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.272},{"id":304502248,"title":"“The View” hosts react to Rep. Jasmine Crockett calling Greg Abbott 'Governor Hot Wheels': 'You just don’t mock people with disabilities'","text":"The ladies of The View are voicing their disapproval of Rep. Jasmine Crockett’s decision to seemingly mock disabled Texas Gov. Greg Abbott by calling him “Governor Hot Wheels” at a recent event.\n\n The 43-year-old Democratic congresswoman made the remark during a speech at the Human Rights Campaign's 2025 Los Angeles Dinner over the weekend, before claiming that “the only thing hot about him is that he is a hot a-- mess.” In an X post yesterday, Crockett clarified that she “wasn’t thinking about the governor’s condition” when she made the comment and was instead “thinking about the planes, trains, and automobiles he used to transfer migrants into communities led by Black mayors, deliberately stoking tension and fear among the most vulnerable.”\n\n She continued, \"Literally, the next line I said was that he was a 'Hot A-- Mess,' referencing his terrible policies. At no point did I mention or allude to his condition.\"\n\n Comedian Joy Behar diagnosed the problem with Crockett’s remark immediately. “She was looking for a way to say hot mess and hot wheels,” she said. “You should leave that stuff to the comedians.”\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more. \n\n Sara Haines added that, instead of trying to clarify her intentions online, Crockett should address the comment head-on, apologize, and keep moving forward. \n\n “Marjorie Taylor Green, we expect that — that’s the only way she can get a headline is by saying crazy stuff and then everyone looks,” she said. “Representative Crockett is so much better than this…. What I love a politician to do is say, ‘You know what, I said that, I shouldn’t have said that,’ and then move on, because then everyone would move on with her. She’s just too good for this.”\n\n Republican cohost Alyssa Farah Griffin noted that it’s “never okay to mock someone’s disability,” no matter who they are. “He was paralyzed from the waist down — governor Abbott — when he was 29 years old, a tree fell on him,” she said. “It’s a tragedy, whether you like him or not. It’s off limits.” \n\n Whoopi Goldberg then turned the incident into a teachable moment about the importance of being “so careful of what you say” these days. “Your intentions may have been absolutely what you say, but once people hear you say something it is not about what you said, it’s about what they think your intentions are,” she explained. “Everybody’s gotta be really careful.” \n\n Sunny Hostin added, “You just don’t mock people with disabilities.

You have to do that because it gives you a lot more credibility when you do that.”\n\n Abbott spoke about Crockett's comment while visiting Sean Hannity's Fox News program yesterday, claiming that the Democrats \"have no vision, no policy\" and \"nothing to sell but hate.\" A Republican lawmaker also has since moved to censure Crockett following her comment, which the panel unanimously agreed was not a good decision. \n\n Goldberg then stated that if the American people are meant to believe President Donald Trump is “just joking” when he lashes out against his adversaries, then the same logic should be applied to Crockett’s comment. Trump previously mocked a disabled reporter and called former President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris “mentally disabled” while on the campaign trail last year.\n\n “Okay, then let’s all do that right now and say, she made a mistake and we’re gonna move on. We’re not censuring people, we’re not gonna do it, we’re gonna say to people, ‘Just don’t do it.' Don’t make jokes. As Joy says,” Goldberg said, prompting Behar to reply, “Leave it to the comedians.” \n\n The View airs weekdays at 11 a.m. ET/10 a.m. PT on ABC.","summary":"\"When you make a mistake you have to own it,\" Sunny Hostin said.","url":"https://ew.com/the-view-hosts-denounce-rep-jasmine-crockett-after-she-calls-disabled-texas-governor-greg-abbott-hot-wheels-11703778","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/AWoNyyfo8SwY_PO30NItm0iTLVs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Jasmine-Crockett-Whoopi-Goldberg-Greg-Abbott-032625-3b12fcb57a1a4849a1717e56e6dfdf04.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 19:15:49","author":"Emlyn Travis","authors":["Emlyn Travis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.285},{"id":304484704,"title":"‘This will not stand’: Critics blast Trump order targeting ‘fake elections’","text":"WASHINGTON – Critics have vowed to fight a new executive order President Donald Trump said would ensure Americans “end up getting fair elections.” \n\nTrump on Tuesday signed an executive order touted as a move to overhaul U.S. elections to address fraud – a complaint he has pitched, without evidence, for years. \n\nWhether the order is enforceable is another story. \n\nMarc Elias, a Democratic attorney, threatened legal action. “This will not stand. We will sue,” he posted on Bluesky. \n\nThe executive order, among other things, would require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections and demands that all ballots be received by Election Day. \n\n“Election fraud. ... This will go a long way toward ending it,” Trump said as he signed the executive order. “There are other steps that we will be taking in the coming weeks. And we think we’ll be able to end up getting fair elections.” \n\nThe order says the U.S. has failed “to enforce basic and necessary election protections” and calls on states to work with federal agencies to share voter lists and prosecute election crimes, The Associated Press said. It threatens to pull federal funding from states where election officials don’t comply. \n\n“Perhaps some people think I shouldn’t be complaining because we won in a landslide, but we’ve got to straighten out our elections,” Trump said at the signing. “This country is so sick because of the elections, the fake elections, the bad elections. We’re going to straighten it out one way or another.” \n\nWhile Trump claimed a landslide victory, he defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris with less than half of the popular vote, 49.8%. Harris captured 48.3%. \n\nDemocrats immediately questioned the validity of the order. \n\nThe U.S. Constitution gives authority over elections to the states. Congress has the power to regulate voting such as through the Voting Rights Act. But Article I, Section 4 makes clear that the “times, places and manner of holding elections” is a power that resides in the states. \n\nColorado’s Democratic secretary of state, Jena Griswold, called the order an “unlawful” weaponization of the federal government and said Trump is “trying to make it harder for voters to fight back at the ballot box,” AP said. \n\nThe ranking member of the House committee that oversees elections, Democratic Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, said the executive order “is not just misguided — it is immoral and illegal.” \n\nTrump has a long history of complaining that elections are flawed and rigged. \n\nIn 2016, he demanded Iowa redo its Republican presidential caucus, claiming that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, another presidential challenger, had stolen the victory. \n\nIn 2020, Trump claimed Democrat Joe Biden stole the election and falsely blamed his loss on widespread fraud. \n\nFederal law already bans noncitizens from voting in federal elections, including races for president, vice president, Senate or House of Representatives and can result in felony charges and deportation. \n\nData from states indicates that voting by noncitizens is rare, But Republican officials have highlighted voter registration reviews that turned up potential noncitizens.","summary":"President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order he said would target election fraud and \"straighten out our elections.\"","url":"https://www.cleveland.com/nation/2025/03/this-will-not-stand-critics-blast-trump-order-targeting-fake-elections.html","image":"https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/WSMYEMB2QVBSZKW36Y3RQRYVT4.jpg?auth=480823966a740a04724148cdac2f69a3122e6fae1f2780cf27a0787269c30ad7&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 18:57:31","author":"Robert Higgs","authors":["Robert Higgs"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.54},{"id":304479380,"title":"Jasmine Crockett Has a Long History of Mocking Greg Abbott’s Wheelchair","text":"Rep. Jasmine Crockett (TX) aims to be the future face of the Democratic Party, which apparently requires acting more radical and obnoxious than other potential candidates like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In terms of ghoulish-ness, Crockett has even AOC edged out. On Tuesday, the dolt congresswoman mocked Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s disability by referring to him as \"Governor Hot Wheels,\" alluding to his wheelchair use. Watch below: For background, Gov. Abbott is paralyzed from the waist down after an oak tree fell on him while he was jogging after a storm in 1984. Still, Crockett downplayed her comments later in the day by claiming she was deriding the governor not for the accident but for \"transferring migrants\" to black communities. \"I wasn’t thinking about the governor’s condition—I was thinking about the planes, trains, and automobiles he used to transfer migrants into communities led by Black mayors, deliberately stoking tension and fear among the most vulnerable,\" she posted on X. \"Literally, the next line I said was that he was a ‘Hot A** Mess,’ referencing his terrible policies. At no point did I mention or allude to his condition. So, I’m even more appalled that the very people who unequivocally support Trump—a man known for racially insensitive nicknames and mocking those with disabilities—are now outraged. Deploying the race card as a deflection of her abhorrent comments is peak \"future face of the Democratic Party\" behavior. She is also lying. In fact, Tuesday was not the first time Crockett mocked Abbott's paraplegic state, as Mediaite noted. In August 2022, Crockett alluded to Abbott \"rolling\" in a wheelchair while supporting Beto O’Rourke in an upcoming gubernatorial race against the Texas governor. \"The new nickname I have for @BetoORourke is the king of the clap backs!\" she wrote. \"Beto is rolling all around the state… where is Abbott rolling to 👀?\" Classy. Crockett shared another post about Abbott \"rolling\" this month, reading, \"Rolling up to the White House to cheer on the president destroying the agency that makes sure kids in wheelchairs have equal access to education is wild.\" A report from the Washington Free Beacon found that Crockett had also shared several Facebook comments joking about Abbott's disability in the past. \"Hot wheels something else,\" read one comment, which she shared. \"Keep making Gov Hot Wheels Mad,\" read another. In other words, Crockett's comments on Tuesday were not only deplorable but also unoriginal. Maybe she will factor in the 2028 Democratic primary. Republicans can only hope. If Jasmine Crockett is the future of the party, the Democrats hardly have one. That said, notice how the legacy media has covered Crockett's remarks about Abbott. Err, hasn't covered her remarks. The likes of Sunny Hostin, Brian Stelter, Rachel Maddow, and Abby Phillip feign nearly daily outrage over what they consider \"offensive\" or \"inappropriate\" comments from politicians. Yet this group has had nothing to say so far regarding Crockett mocking Abbott's paraplegic state. The privileges of a black female Democrat are real. Granted, race and gender are not enough of a selling point to convince the American people you are worthy of leading the country. Kamala Harris tried that approach in November and failed.

Crockett said she was referring to Abbott’s policy of busing illegal immigrants to Democratic cities, which was an obvious lie even before it was revealed she posted and reposted similar insults about Abbott’s condition in the past.\n\nCrockett’s history of ugly statements extends beyond mocking disabilities. She has taken over as the leading Democratic race-baiter in Congress. She said Hispanic voters who support President Donald Trump are people who can “barely vote” and have a “slave mentality.” She also said black men who didn’t support former Vice President Kamala Harris were misogynists and that she didn’t trust white women, implying they were racist and self-hating for not supporting Harris.\n\nABBOTT SAYS GOP WILL LEAVE DEMOCRATS ‘IN THE DUST’ FOLLOWING CROCKETT’S ‘HOT WHEELS’ JAB\n\nDespite only being in her second term in the House, Crockett has compiled a long record of hateful, inflammatory, and unprofessional comments.

Kareem Rahma Planned It That Way","text":"areem Rahma has a funny saying right now. \n\n Unlike the average commuter, Rahma steps onto the subway with at least two camera people when he films his hit interview series Subway Takes. So people are usually surprised to see Rahma capturing footage on the side, sometimes of a guest, the setup, or the mundane bits in between. \n\n “People ask me what I’m doing I’ll go, ‘Oh, that’s for the documentary,’” he tells me on a recent gusty Wednesday in Brooklyn. The documentary in question? It doesn’t exist, at least not yet. But behind the quote is the defining praxis of Rahma’s life — one that’s taken him from a Minneapolis kid desperate to be rich to the host of one of TikTok’s most popular interview series: Making things happen is as easy as making them happen. \n\n “To me, the worst thing in the world was the [idea] of being a 33-year-old divorced guy and introducing myself to women as an aspiring comedian. That’s the worst. That’s a nightmare blunt rotation. You shouldn’t be aspiring. You have to be.”\n\n The Egyptian American host, 38, is most easily recognized for fronting the digital interview series Subway Takes, where he sits on various metros — though it started in New York, he’s expanded to Chicago (“L Takes”) — and coolly asks commuters one question: “So what’s your take?” The answer vary in both comprehension and general joie de vivre, including responses like “Men should have to menstruate once a year, every year,” or “Ban all cemeteries,” or “If a barber fucks up your hair, [you] should be allowed to sue them.” \n\n Rahma’s uniform for the episodes is a big suit and dark sunglasses, an ensemble that practically oozes nonchalance while he bluntly boos or hypes up the person’s take. “The sunglasses are a disguise,” he says. “There’s a lot of emotions in the eyes. So I’m preserving a piece of myself.” Subway Takes has grown into one of the most popular (and recognizable) short-form shows online, which has recently included launching a podcast with Talkhouse Media in February. The show, SubwayTakes Uncut, continues with its signature rapid energy, but starts the cameras early to chart how Rahma and his Subway Takes get from introduction to final question in a subway. This takes about 20 minutes, at which point Rahma and cohost Andrew Kuo (co-creator of Subway Takes) valiantly try to talk through the clip and end up immediately devolving into a stream of consciousness babble. In fact, if Subway Takes had an easily quantifiable characteristic, the best way to describe it would probably be unserious. This commonality is the show — and podcast’s — key draw: everyone has places to be. Here’s what they’re thinking about on the way. \n\n Since posting the first episode in 2023, Subway Takes has featured everyone from Charli XCX (her take: “Music is not important”), to Cate Blanchett (“Leaf blowers need to be eradicated ”), to Vice Presidential-candidate Tim Walz (“The most neglected part of home ownership is the gutters”). It only takes two cameramen to film the series, making the operation light to move and exceptionally cheap to produce — a low cost that allowed Rahma to increase production from two videos a week to four. Even when the claims are ridiculous, or Rahma vehemently disagrees, the lack of time to dwell gives the videos a sense of both urgency and fun. And Rahma picks guests the way he picked his career, he only does what he wants to do. (In November 2024, he told the New York Times that after an awkward shoot with Presidential-candidate Kamala Harris, he scrapped the video entirely.) “I don’t get pleasure from being on the grind,” he says. “There’s power in power — and knowing that I can talk to whoever I want whenever I want.” \n\n Rahma consistently straddles this line between self-deprecating and unabashedly secure, so he’s constantly pointing out when things sound annoying or overconfident, but quickly backs up with evidence. Simply put, he’s never been proven wrong. He wanted to be famous, so he became famous. It’s why he attributes so much of his success to his attitude. “For the longest time, sincerity was seen as stupid,” Rahma says. “Everyone was cynical. And I remember at the time I was like, ‘I’m gonna be sincere, because that’s how I feel.’”\n\n Subway Takes’ growth proves Rahma’s plan of openness is working — it just might be working a little too well for him to take uninterrupted walks anymore. “People clock me at the pharmacy. The urinal. The TSA Pre-Check line,” he says, laughing. “At passport control entering the United States! I’m like, ‘Bro, this is serious business!’ We’re trying to get back in. Why are you pitching me takes?” \n\n Rahma knows he’s a latecomer to the influencer game. But he’s focusing on a new challenge — trying to see if he can strike the balance between making money and not getting bored along the way. \n\n “My worry is not that people think it’s stupid and cringe,” he says. “I do want people to like it. But my checklist goes ‘Do I find it entertaining? Yes. Does my audience find it entertaining? I hope so.’ I’m my own first audience.\n\n IT’S REALLY HARD TO INTERVIEW someone who keeps throwing questions back at you. When I ask Rahma about his childhood, he asks me where I grew up. A query about his first job ends up swinging the conversation back to my first shift at the Sonic drive-through. Relationships? What about mine? Even conversations about his Brooklyn home somehow include me divulging my exact cross streets. “I don’t do it on purpose,” he says. “I’m genuinely interested, because I’m always absorbing information to see how I can apply it to my life. “ \n\n Born in Cairo, Rahma’s family emigrated to the United States when he was an infant, settling in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The family struggled financially, but “my dad saw the future,” he says. “He was like, ‘The internet is gonna be important.’” So he bought a computer on credit and installed it in the garage. “It was not insulated,” Rahma says, laughing. “I lived in Minneapolis. I would be in the fucking computer room with like a blanket on Saturday morning in chat rooms, browsing the web, figuring out like MySpace and HTML, talking to strangers. That became the closest thing to an interest I had.” \n\n Rahma graduated from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities in 2008, but to chart his career — and outlook shift — from that icy garage to New York city’s subway system is to mention his numerous side gigs. He worked at McDonald’s, as a busboy at a Yacht Club, a telemarketer, at the student newspaper, at an internet advertising agency, and as a vacuum salesman, door to door. During the winter months, he would buy motorcycles with his student loan payouts, store them in his garage, and then sell them for profit in the spring. \n\n “I started working at 14, and I just stayed working. I literally never stopped,” Rahma says. “Interests, likes, none of that was part of the equation. It was simply, I want to be rich. I need money. I don’t want to be in poverty.”\n\n That drive for cash eventually found Rahma at his supposed dream job at an ad agency in Minneapolis. He expected it to be the “coolest place in the world,” but Rahma hated every minute of it. “I was like, ‘This is not Mad Men at all!” he says. “We were writing tweets, but this is back before tweets were funny. Now, Wendy’s tweets ‘Yo, I’m fucking listening to Travis Scott.’ This was ‘Make sure you swing by Whole Foods to pick up juice on Tuesday.’ It was miserable.’” So he sold his car and headed to New York.\n\n SUBWAY TAKES is Rahma’s most popular venture by far — but his first success was the show Keep The Meter Running in 2022. The episodes were similarly transit themed, but featured Rahma hopping into a cab and directing the driver to take him to their favorite place with a Bourdain-esque interest in their lives, which meant destinations could fluctuate from an Ghanaian eatery in the Bronx to a kosher-Uzbek restaurant in Queens. The series was featured in Vanity Fair and Rahma considered it “his baby,” but it was expensive to make. “It costs a lot of money to actually keep the meter running,” he says. \n\n He needed something that gave him the same level of excitement but didn’t take $2,000 out of his pocket every episode. Friend after friend reached out to start a podcast with him, only to reveal they were mainly interested in content they could clip and post online. Rahma thought he could do them one better: a podcast of clips, without the actual podcast to listen to. Rahma’s friend Kuo came up with the hook, specifically the idea of filming it on the train. “It felt like I was being mischievous,” Rahma says. “Like ‘Hahaha, podcasters, fuck you.’” \n\n So how does the podcast that’s a fuck you to podcasts get its own podcast? Rahma says that’s just a continuation of the joke. “That is the desire for me to entertain myself,” he says. “Because after two years of doing 300-90 second videos, I’m like, ‘How do I make this more exciting for myself?’ How do I expand the universe?’” Since Subway Takes is about strongly doubling down on spicy — and often unimportant — opinions, the podcast takes that format a step further by including a longer version of a filmed Subway Takes episode and then letting Rahma and Kuo chitchat with mics. How else could you describe a podcast that starts with an interview with Jane Goodall and somehow includes discussions of Popeyes’ marketing team, Parisian skincare, and Sean John jeans? \n\n Just because Rahma has a successful TikTok show, doesn’t mean he’s unaware of the thing that separates him from his social media counterparts. At 38, he’s older than the average TikTok star. But Rahma thinks his age is a secret advantage. “The untraditional career that I have makes me feel young. But when you’re fucking 20, 38 is literally the oldest man in the world. I’m the oldest young man,” he says. “To me, [my age] was an advantage. Because, weirdly, I knew what to do.” That doesn’t mean he’s not taken by surprise when he looks in the mirror sometimes — but Rahma, who shares a two-year-old with his wife, Karina Muslimova, is trying to embrace those moments with humor when they come. “I have a lot of grays, but I didn’t notice that until like two weeks ago,” he says. “I mean I knew that they were there, but I looked real close in the mirror and was like ‘Holy Shit, I look old.’”\n\n As he gets older, Rahma tells Rolling Stone that his perspective on life — and the idea of living in a moment — continues to change, mostly because he knows what it’s like to let things slip by. “My father passed away while I was in college in 2007,” he says. “I was deflecting the reality of what was happening. I didn’t move home. I just continued coming home on Saturdays. He had cancer and I knew he had six months to live. And I didn’t change anything. I knew that if I took a break, the likelihood of me returning was lost, because I wasn’t really interested in college. And I knew my dad would want me to finish. But now as an adult, I’m regretful that I didn’t spend that time.” \n\n Enjoying the journey feels like an adage that should exist on a TJ Maxx pillow and not on the lips of one of most popular digital hosts today. But Rahma isn’t focused on feeling anything other than lucky. And besides, there’s no place for regret in the documentary. \n\n “I’m grateful that I’m in a place where I support myself and my family, and also have faith in something that is culturally relevant and impactful, and will hopefully be in the documentary at some point about New York during this time,” Rahma says, swiping through his phone to show me picture after picture of his daughter. “I’m not in a hurry to go to the next spot, which may be the first time in my life.

Eleven women have publicly called out Harry Sisson, 23, claiming the Irish influencer with 1.8 million followers on TikTok led them on by claiming they were exclusive and getting them to send him explicit pics.He regularly shares anti-Trump posts and simpering messages in support of figures such as Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.How does Harry Sisson know Joe Biden?Harry Sisson, who once interviewed former US President Joe Biden, has been accused of using his status as a rising star among Dem influencers to manipulate a gullible “roster” of women online.ALSO READ: Harry Sisson Snapchat scandal: This TikTok influencer and Biden fan lured women to share explicit videosBorn in 2002, Harry Sisson is a 23-year-old TikTok influencer who started posting on the social media app in the year 2020. At that time, he was pursuing his higher studies and is currently a student at the New York University. His account gained attention after he posted a series of videos supporting the Democratic President Joe Biden back in high school. Sisson has since risen in fame and met popular political figures such as former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Sisson built up a huge following in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election for his posts in support of Biden and even interviewed the then-commander in chief in May. According to the pinned videos on his TikTok profile, he’s previously met with former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, both Democrats.Harry Sisson was probably the biggest TikTok creator backing the then President Joe Biden with his whole chest. “I gotta be honest, it doesn’t feel good,” Sisson had said while watching a contingent of young liberals turn against Biden. “It doesn’t feel good at all.”Harry also met Biden in December and at that time the ex President told the creator, “I hear a lot of great things about you,” as the two shook hands. It was an honor and a privilege to meet President Biden in the Oval Office. He’s a good man and I’m incredibly thankful for his dedication to the country. Thank you for an amazing 4 years, Sisson wrote in an Instagram post.ALSO READ: Democrat influencer Harry Sisson under attack for manipulating women to share explicit videos: Who is he?Harry Sisson snapchat scandalThe Democrat content creator and influencer has been caught in a humongous social media scandal. As per the posts going viral on X, Sisson allegedly convinced nearly a dozen women to share explicit photos of themselves via Snapchat.Sarah Fields, a conservative influencer and Republican State delegate in Texas, brought the story to light after a number of the women involved posted their version of events on TikTok.“Harry Sisson convinced 11 different women that ‘he had no roster,’ and ‘respected them for more than their bodies,’ while persuading them to send explicit photos of themselves through Snapchat, including one from a domestic abuse survivor,” Fields claimed in a now-viral thread on X.“When the women discovered each other one by one, he called them all insane and attempted to coerce one of them into telling the public that the photos were ‘fake.”One of the women, Carlee Hosch, shared a picture of a message Sisson allegedly sent her on Snapchat in which he denied he was “getting nudes from a bunch of girls.”ALSO READ: 'Elon, I want to thank you': Trump makes it official, makes big statement amid Tesla Takedown protests“Right now, I can’t do exclusivity,” the message reads. “Not because I’m getting nudes from a bunch of girls or f–king girls and stuff (I don’t hook up with anyone ever) but because I just don’t think I’d be able to commit 100% to somerhing [sic].”Hosch also claimed she was “wooed” into setting up a private chat where she shared nudes with an influencer believed to be Sisson, according to a viral TikTok video that does not name Sisson directly.In the video, she claims Sisson described her as “wifey material.” Then, after six months of talking, he told her he didn’t want anything serious, sparking an argument.ALSO READ: US military plans chat leak: Who added Atlantic editor in the group?

I haven’t done anything that wasn’t allowed within the parameters we set. What and why are you screenshotting.” The fallout left many online divided, with some calling his action “predatory” and “gross,” while others said the whole story was a tempest in a teacup.Harry Sisson did not respond immediately to requests for comment. His most recent post on X shows a selfie of him on the street, and does not directly reference the claims made about him. “Feeling good today! Let’s continue to fight for democracy and stay focused on stopping Trump,” he wrote.","summary":"Harry Sisson, a University student in the US, has been making headlines after he was accused by a dozen of women of luring them to send their explicit videos on Snapchat.

Collins has signaled she doesn't plan to retire at the end of her current term, throwing a wrench in Democrats' hopes of winning the seat.Still, history may indicate that 2026 could be more Democratic-leaning. Typically, the sitting president's party loses seats during the midterms, and President Donald Trump's approval rating has already begun to drop.This race is set to draw national attention and millions of dollars of investment from both parties over the next few years in what could become a tight race for Senate control.What To KnowThe survey from Public Policy Polling, which is generally viewed as having a Democratic slant, found that only 24 percent of Mainers approve of Collins, compared to 61 percent of voters with a negative view of her.The poll found that Trump is more popular among Maine voters than Collins. Forty-four percent of respondents said they approve of his job performance compared to 52 percent who disapprove. That's close to how the state voted in November, when 52.4 percent of the state's votes went to Harris, and 45.5 percent backed Trump.The poll surveyed 569 Maine voters from March 20 to March 21, 2025, and the margin of error was plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.Collins' low approval rating is in part due to Republican opposition, according to the survey. While 71 percent of Harris voters disapproved of Collins, 52 percent of Trump voters also disapproved.Her votes on Trump's Cabinet picks reflect the fine line she walks in light-blue Maine, where she has supported more moderate policies on issues like abortion and LGBTQ+ rights to win over centrist voters in the general election while also trying to avoid a conservative revolt.Her vote against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sparked criticism and primary calls from more conservative Republicans. However, her votes for other nominees, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to lead the Department of Health and Human Services drew backlash from the left.Who Could Run Against Susan Collins?While some more conservative Republicans have taken issue with those moderate stances, Collins has never faced a serious primary challenge in the past. It's unclear that a more conservative Republican would be able to take her on this year.She faces at least one primary challenge from former police officer Daniel Smeriglio, according to Portland news station WTMW.It's also not clear who will challenge Collins on the Democratic side.Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who unsuccessfully ran against Collins in 2014, announced Wednesday she plans to run in the gubernatorial race. Former Maine Senate President Troy Jackson is also exploring a gubernatorial run.Democratic Governor Janet Mills declined to rule out running for Senate in a November interview with the Portland Press Herald but hasn't confirmed a run. Representatives Jared Golden and Chellie Pingree have been floated as potential candidates.2026 Midterms: Key Senate RacesNorth Carolina, where Republican Senator Thom Tillis is up for reelection, is likely to be Democrats' best shot at flipping a Senate seat.Republicans are eyeing Democratic-held seats in Georgia and Michigan, two states that backed Trump last November.Meanwhile, Democratic incumbents in two other light blue states, Minnesota and New Hampshire, announced they are retiring. The Cook Political Report views Democrats as the favorites in those seats, but Republicans will also hope to compete there.If Democrats have a strong environment next year, they may also look at states like Florida, Iowa, Ohio and Texas, which backed Trump by double digits but are viewed as less strongly Republican than other states, to secure a majority.What People Are SayingPublic Policy Polling in a write-up of the poll: \"It will come down to who ends up deciding to challenge her- both on the Republican side and the Democratic side. But Susan Collins appears to be in a very weak position personally headed into what history suggests should probably be a strong 2026 election cycle for Democrats.\"Politico journalist Ally Mutnick wrote of the poll: \"The survey does have some good results for Collins. She still has support from 17 percent of Harris voters, a not insignificant level of crossover appeal. Compare that to Trump, who has an approval rating of just 2 percent with Harris voters.\"What Happens NextMore candidates are expected to make formal announcements in the Maine senate and gubernatorial races over the coming year.","summary":"A new poll showed both Democrats and Republicans in the state disapprove of Collins.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/susan-collins-less-popular-donald-trump-maine-poll-2050827","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2615062/senator-susan-collins-approval-poll.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 16:31:31","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.6},{"id":304423468,"title":"The Democrats’ toothless resistance","text":"Last October, the 80-year-old Democratic strategist James Carville confidently declared in the New York Times that Kamala Harris would win the White House. Last month he made another proclamation in the same paper: the most effective strategy for opposing Trump, he opined, was to let him self-destruct. This struck many as the exact wrong advice given Trump’s super-accelerated process of vastly expanding executive power, overwhelming the legislative branch and working towards openly defying and breaking the judiciary. America is becoming another country. If the Republicans lose the House in 18 months and refuse to acknowledge the validity of the election, America will be another country.\n\nVirtually allowing Trump to hurtle forward unimpeded is also producing the unanticipated effect of exposing the vapid, venal obsequiousness at the core of present-day liberalism. Recall the Black Lives Matter movement and the ensuing waves of policed speech and cancelled careers amid scarce material change to actual black lives. Then flash forward to Al Green, a black Democratic congressman from Texas, who rose in defiance during Trump’s joint address to Congress, shouting at Trump and waving his cane in protest. Scores of Green’s fellow Democrats condemned his behaviour. Later, after Green was censured by the House, a small group of Democrats gathered around him on the House floor and sang the civil rights anthem “We Shall Overcome”. Yet Green’s daring had nothing to do with the civil rights movement of six decades ago. He had intervened in the urgent present, representing the conscience of all Americans, as black figures have often done. But his fellow liberals admonished him, and then patronised him.\n\nLast week, Tim Walz, recently Kamala Harris’s running mate, spoke like a populist, in the manner of a real person rather than a politician – Trump’s irresistible power – when he called Elon Musk “a South African nepo baby” and a “dipshit”. The left denounced Walz for, as the New York Times priggishly put it, “attack[ing] Musk with language from the Trump playbook”. (They have a “playbook”. We have a “strategy”.) Democrats appear to favour Bernie Sanders’ thrilling slogan: “Fight the Oligarchy!” Most Americans recoil at ten-dollar words. Many have no idea of what an oligarchy is.\n\nAt the same time, liberals expressed outrage at desperate presidential aspirant Gavin Newsom, an echt-progressive who has cosied up to far-right agitators like Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk on Newsom’s new podcast. Empty outrage seems to be the only consistent liberal response to anything. Behind all the moral indignation, though, is what usually animates the vehement public display of moral indignation: a secret, fatal attraction to the amoral status quo of wealth and social standing.\n\nThe liberal media reported endlessly on how Chuck Schumer, Senate Democratic minority leader, cancelled his book tour (supposedly fearing for his safety) after voting for the Republican-drafted budget. What didn’t bother the liberal media was Schumer planning a book tour during the worst political crisis in America’s modern history. Weeks before, during Senate hearings on the cabinet nomination of Robert F Kennedy Jr, the Democrat Ron Wyden, the powerful ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, paused in the middle of a CNN interview to promote his own book. It’s called It Takes Chutzpah. Chutzpah is Yiddish for fearless defiance.\n\nQueens-born, Manhattan-formed Trump knows chutzpah when he doesn’t see it. He watched with utter lack of surprise as yesterday’s liberal exemplars raced to press their lips to his posterior: Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, the LA Times, the Washington Post, law firms and universities, most recently Columbia. The last particularly rankles. The university had been an early adopter of hyperactive DEI practices, but Trump threatens to withhold $400m in funding and he’s granted concessions including hiring “special officers” to arrest students, and putting the Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies department into what amounts to receivership. Columbia’s nearly $14bn endowment should empower it to defy Trump. Its capitulation seems to have helped open the door to Netanyahu’s resumption of the campaign to raze Gaza. Trump’s advisers know the heart of American protest, from Vietnam to today, has been Columbia – but no longer.\n\nLiberal righteousness seeks group affirmation. Yet the solitude of the true dissident “hath no flatterers”, as Byron wrote. It was easy to “resist” Trump for eight years starting in 2016. The wealthy and socially elevated all did so. Now they support Trump in ever greater numbers.\n\nThe left drones on about the importance of “speaking to working-class concerns”, but plenty of Trump’s supporters are not working class. These concerns are conceived of as economic. But working-class people rarely define themselves in economic terms. Few do, except the very poor and very rich. If there is such a thing in America as a common idiom that includes the working class, it’s this: blunt, colourful, irreverent, sometimes unsettling speech. Terrified of saying the wrong, unsocialised thing, liberals cannot, for the life of them, speak plainly. Having played and profited by the rules all their lives, they simply have no idea what to do when the rules disappear.","summary":"Liberals’ moral outrage only masks their allegiance to an amoral status quo.","url":"https://www.newstatesman.com/international-politics/2025/03/the-democrats-toothless-resistance","image":"https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/03/26/00034776.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 15:25:15","author":"Lee Siegel","authors":["Lee Siegel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.089},{"id":304420264,"title":"OPINION - Spring Statement: Labour are now becoming a recruiting agency for Reform","text":"Jean-Claude Juncker was a Marmite politician. You liked him or you hated him. \n\nThe former EU Commission president was a terrible drunk, had an arrogant disdain for most of his contemporaries and loved nothing more than baiting our Brexiteers. He also had a wonderful knack for seductively honest communication, which I confess gave me a soft spot for him.\n\nAt the start of one summit (after a particularly well lubricated lunch), he greeted Hungary’s Viktor Orbán with a playful slap round the face: “Dictator! Hello dictator”. \n\nJuncker made great copy. He also gave us the greatest political quote of our times. As EU leaders met to discuss a hugely unpopular taxpayer bailout for the Greek economy that was collapsing from years of lead swinging and corruption, Juncker said: “We all know what to do, but we don’t know how to get re-elected once we have done it”.\n\nWith that, he nailed the great conundrum for politicians today. Despite all their blather, they usually do know exactly what tough medicine they must prescribe to get their countries through difficult times. But so often they dare not for fear of the voters punishing them.\n\nThis is precisely why Sir Keir Starmer’s government has got itself into such a terrible pickle this week. Before last July’s general election, Labour promised they wouldn’t make any spending cuts or put up any of the big taxes. Promised, not just hoped. \n\nFrom the dispatch box today, Rachel Reeves blamed “increased global uncertainty” for why she is now having to do both. “The world is changing before our eyes,” the Chancellor solemnly declared, collapsing growth and forcing her to raise more than £50 billion of revenue from tax rises in last October’s Budget and government spending cuts in today’s Spring Statement.\n\nExcept, it isn’t true. The world hasn’t really changed. And as far as her job is concerned, it hasn’t at all. All the things Reeves says she now urgently needs to tackle were crystal clear for months before Labour was elected. \n\nTreasury coffers have been in the red for a couple of years now, military chiefs have been warning defence spending must rise since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, it’s been obvious since Covid that the benefits bill was soaring out of control; and Donald Trump’s re-election and imposition of trade tariffs (“the most beautiful word in the dictionary”, he told rally after rally) had been a strong bet since he won the Republican nomination last March. \n\nAll these issues, as Laura Kuenssberg put it to Reeves deftly on Sunday, were “visible from space”. Yet nowhere in Labour’s election manifesto was a 1.2 percentage point rise in employers’ National Insurance contributions, cuts to pensioners’ winter fuel payments, halving the international aid budget, axing £4.8bn of disability benefits and eye-watering cuts of up to 11 per cent from some unprotected departments.\n\nThe product? A widely unpopular government accused of badly deceiving the electorate that only put it in place nine months ago, while hitting its own core Labour supporters the hardest. A fate, through its deceptions and omissions, it has largely brought on itself. \n\nWhat happens as a result? Everything just gets worse. Distrust in mainstream politicians worsens, voters begin to loathe Labour as they grew to loathe the Tories, and the populists on the fringes have a new field day. \n\nNigel Farage loves nothing more than a whopping great broken promise by those entrusted with power. It’s been his currency of trade for decades. If only Starmer/Sunak/Boris/Theresa/Cameron/Brown/Blair (delete as applicable) had the guts to do the simple things I’d do to fix all of this, he trumpets. Just as Trump did for months with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Or the AfD with Olaf Scholz, Marine Le Pen with Emmanuel Macron.\n\nIf Reform UK doesn’t now take its first Labour seat at the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, I’ll change my name to Jean-Claude. Worse, it will make our mainstream politicians even less willing to offer up difficult answers. What’s the use in their grey nuance for an ever more complicated world when the populists who promise technicolour in broad strokes will destroy them for it, they will ask.\n\nHow did we manage to descend to this level of cowardice in our once revered political debate? A debate that used to champion the courage to face down difficult realities. One that remembered Winston Churchill’s most famous speech as the one where he told the House of Commons in 1940, “I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.”\n\nSomething has gone terribly wrong with all of us. Yes, our politicians look like pygmies compared to their noble forefathers, and maybe they are. But is it really all their fault? Can we really only blame them for not volunteering to be turkeys before Christmas?\n\nMaybe it’s our fault, too. Maybe we’re no longer mature enough to hear the bad news as well. Could Western electorates who’ve had it so good for so long have lost any concept of having to do the harder yards sometimes, too? But understandably, we’re also an angrier and far more volatile lot — with our living standards flatlining at best ever since the 2008 financial crash. And all of this made worse by the relentlessly unforgiving social media echo chamber that crushes difficult debate.\n\nA confession to end with. The worst type of political column is one where you set out a problem that you can’t then answer. How to bring back honesty and realism to our political debate? I’m afraid I can’t. It’s an incredibly difficult challenge.\n\nFor me it’s also the most worrying ill of our age, and one that is even beginning to threaten democracy itself when you look at how sinisterly the great orange populist-in-chief is now pursuing US judges and the free press.\n\nWhat I can do, though, is suggest the ballpark where the solution could come from. \n\nIt’s the ballpark called leadership. Not timidly following and pandering, but setting a destination, powerfully and persistently arguing its case and eventually persuading your reluctant country to follow you. \n\nYes it’s so much harder to do these days with all the disillusion, anger and deafening cacophonies. It would also take real guts, and it’s not without risk. Jean-Claude Juncker would be the first to raise a sympathetic cognac to that. But if a first term prime minister with the second biggest Commons majority in 100 years can’t, who can? \n\nTom Newton Dunn is a broadcaster and political commentator","summary":"Jean-Claude Juncker was a Marmite politician.

The complaint does not demand a specific dollar amount, but leaves the determination to the jury. The lawsuit claims The Daily Beast articles harmed LaCivita’s ability to find new clients.\n\nThe allegation traces back to an October article written by freelance journalist Michael Isikoff and originally titled “Trump In Cash Crisis-As Campaign Chief’s $22m Pay Revealed.” The current version has altered the headline to reflect a lower figure: $19.2 million.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the records “clearly show that the $22 million figure is the gross spend (the overwhelming majority of which was for ad buys), not the money which Mr. LaCivita personally received.” \n\nThe Daily Beast repeated the allegations in several follow-up articles and the outlet’s chief content officer, Joanna Coles, discussed them on a podcast.\n\nOn Nov. 5, LaCivita’s lawyers demanded a correction and retraction, pointing to campaign finance reports that documented the expenditures, The New York Post reported. The Daily Beast corrected the article a few days later, changing the amount and clarifying that the funds went to LaCivita’s consulting firm, rather than to the campaign adviser personally. The outlet also changed the headline and added an editor’s note.\n\nThe Daily Beast deleted its podcast episode after LaCivita’s lawyers demanded more retractions in January. \n\nThe outlet declined further demands from LaCivita’s team, Axios reported. \n\n“The Daily Beast stands by its reporting on Chris LaCivita,” a representative said. “His lawsuit is meritless and a transparent attempt to intimidate the Beast and silence the independent press.”\n\nThe Daily Beast “should have investigated and followed the money before publishing lies in order to get clicks and push their political agenda,” LaCivita’s lawyer, Mark Geragos, told The New York Times.\n\nThe lawsuit comes after Trump has filed multiple defamation cases against left-leaning legacy media outlets. ABC News paid $15 million to settle a lawsuit after anchor George Stephanopoulos falsely claimed that Trump had been found civilly liable for raping the writer E. Jean Carroll (a jury found him liable for sexually assaulting Carroll, not raping her). Trump has sued CBS News for $20 billion, alleging that it deceptively edited an interview with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris before the election.\n\nThe Supreme Court dismissed Monday a Trump donor’s defamation lawsuit against the Associated Press. \n\nTrump and multiple Supreme Court justices have called for revisiting the key defamation precedent New York Times v. Sullivan.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas publicly dissented when the Supreme Court refused to hear a defamation case against the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2022, writing that the case of Coral Ridge Ministries justified reconsidering the precedent.

They believe the incident proves that Waltz (a former adviser to Dick Cheney, a Kamala Harris-voting Republican) never should have been trusted in the first place, and should be shown the door soon. \n\n Trump indicated Tuesday morning that Waltz’s position is safe, telling NBC News that his national security adviser “learned a lesson, and he’s a good man.” Trump added later on Tuesday: “No, I don’t think [Waltz] should apologize. I think he’s doing his best.”\n\n Waltz couldn’t seem to get his story straight about what happened while appearing on Fox News later on Tuesday, suggesting that Goldberg may have surreptitiously hacked his way into the chat, while also taking “full responsibility” for the breach and vowing to “get to the bottom” of it. (Trump is apparently putting Waltz in charge of the internal investigation into the matter, if you can believe it.)\n\n “Have you ever had somebody’s contact that shows their name and then you have somebody else’s number there?” Waltz told Laura Ingraham, adding: “Of course I didn’t see this loser in the group. It looked like someone else. Whether he did it deliberately or it happened in some other technical mean is something we’re trying to figure out.”\n\n The three Trump administration officials who spoke to Rolling Stone voiced mild, or at times extreme, displeasure that Waltz apparently allowed Goldberg — who is despised by Trump and many of his lieutenants and confidants — to be on the receiving end of a genuinely big scoop. The officials also say there has been widespread gossiping throughout the new Trump administration about how this series of events is so punishingly dumb, that some White House aides and senior administration hands keep referencing to one another different pieces of television or popular culture to underscore the absurdity of the apparently accidental Signal leak.\n\n “Is Waltz just Jonah from Veep then?” says a Trump appointee, referencing the episode of the HBO political comedy series in which the widely loathed character is fired after it is discovered that he anonymously posted sensitive information to his blog, “West Wing Man.”\n\n Beneath the humor is a gravely serious situation or even, as some would dub it, a scandal that poses real national security risk — given that Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President J.D. Vance, and other high-level officials were involved in the group chat. The situation has generated so much blowback that even Trump acknowledged that it was a “glitch” amid what he described as a “perfect” two months.\n\n “The staggering failure to adhere to even the basic principles of security protocols, especially for senior officials who have a staff to handle the boring details, is an insult to the rest of the cleared community,” says Bradley Moss, an attorney specializing in national security and government transparency issues. “Needless to say, clients I have represented have lost their jobs and their clearances for mishaps that don’t even come close to what occurred here.”\n\n Democrats attempted to highlight the stakes of the breach in a public grilling of CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tusli Gabbard during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Tuesday morning, with Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) noting that if this happened “with a military officer or an intelligence officer and they had this kind of behavior, they would be fired.” \n\n Ratcliffe and Gabbard, who were both reportedly on the chat, denied that any classified information had been shared, but admitted that Signal was likely an inappropriate channel to discuss plots to bomb another country. They avoided the committee’s request to review the contents of the chat, despite contending its contents weren’t classified. Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) warned that the committee would “get the full transcript of this chain” and that Ratcliffe and Gabbard’s testimony “will be measured carefully against its content.”\n\n Time will tell what comes of the Democratic effort to uncover what actually happened. Goldberg on Wednesday released the group chat’s messages detailing the attack plans against the Houthis in Yemen, throwing another bucket of cold water on the administration’s claims that nothing classified was shared in the chat, and that war plans were not discussed. “We are currently clean on OPSEC,” or operational security, Hegseth wrote in one of the newly released messages, which the Pentagon chief blasted to an unsecured chat he didn’t even know who was reading.\n\n The Trump officials who spoke to Rolling Stone are privately bemoaning how much the humiliating national-security breach reminds them of the opening months of the first Trump presidency, when these sorts of — in the words of a White House official — “comically ridiculous” news items of high-level, casual incompetence and self-inflicted chaos reigned supreme.\n\n There have been plenty of these kinds of stories across the second administration, of course, but Team Trump still generally insists its operations are more buttoned-up these days. Given how ruthlessly and quickly they’ve been executing the most openly lawless, corrupt, and cruel parts of Trump’s agenda, they may have at least a minor point.","summary":"Trump’s allies are having flashbacks to his first administration after his national security adviser added a journalist to a sensitive group chat","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/mike-waltz-rebuked-team-trump-group-chat-leak-1235303336/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mike-waltz-trump-nsa.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 14:00:00","author":"Asawin Suebsaeng,Nikki McCann Ramirez,Ryan Bort","authors":["Asawin Suebsaeng","Nikki McCann Ramirez","Ryan Bort"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.373},{"id":304371812,"title":"Oregon officials say Trump’s voting executive order likely to face legal challenges","text":"President Donald Trump signed a far-reaching executive order Tuesday that would require individuals to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote and prevent states like Oregon from counting mail-in ballots received after election day.\n\nOregon officials are analyzing how specific provisions in the order would impact voting here. But Secretary of State Tobias Read, whose office oversees Oregon elections, said the fundamental aim of Trump’s order was to make it more difficult for people to vote. He said it was almost certain to be challenged, either by Oregon or other states.\n\n“We know voter ID laws have a pretty chilling impact on voter registration,” including inequitable impacts on communities of color and others, he said in an interview Tuesday. Oregon is a national leader in voter turnout, he added, “but what worries me is that we should be trying to make it more convenient for people to vote.”\n\nLikewise, Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in an emailed statement that “if President Trump or anyone else takes action that threatens the integrity of how we vote in Oregon, we will use all the legal tools we have to defend our state’s values and elections.”\n\nTrump has a long history of railing against election validity and fairness. He often claims elections are being rigged, even before the results are known, and has waged battles against certain voting methods since he lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden and falsely blamed it on widespread fraud.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution gives states authority over elections. While Congress has the power to regulate voting — and has done so to pass such laws as the Voting Rights Act — the Constitution makes clear that states have primary authority to set the “times, places and manner” for elections.\n\nOregon has been a national leader in getting out the vote since it established vote-by-mail as the standard mechanism for voting in 1996. The measure has proven popular among voters and led to some of the highest voter turnout rates in the country. In 2024, turnout was 75% of the 3.1 million eligible voters in the November election, according to figures compiled by the Secretary of State’s Office.\n\nOregon was also the first state to adopt automatic voter registration when Gov. Kate Brown signed the Motor Voter Act in 2015, which led to a surge in voter registrations.\n\nRead said the vast majority of Oregon voters register under to vote under that automatic registration option at the DMV. The law makes voter registration automatic when eligible unregistered voters visit the Department of Motor Vehicles to apply for, renew or replace an Oregon driver’s license, ID card or permit. Eligible Individuals are already required to provide documentation to demonstrate they are U.S. citizens.\n\nBut that program has not been without missteps.\n\nIt was suspended in October 2024 after errors led DMV employees to improperly register about 1,600 people to vote, including individuals who had no documentation proving citizenship or showed foreign passports. Only a handful of people were found to have voted after being improperly registered and the program was reinstated in February after DMV put steps in place to eliminate the errors.\n\nOregon Republicans introduced a bill this year that would require Read’s office to verify the documentation that the DMV and the Oregon Health Authority use to confirm citizenship before voters are added to the rolls. A separate bill was introduced to eliminate automatic voter registration altogether. Neither bill has received a vote in the House Committee on Rules, and it’s not clear that Republicans have any hope of passing them given Democrats’ grip on the Legislature. \n\nVoters can also register online with the Secretary of State’s My Vote site. That system typically requires a valid Oregon Driver’s license permit or ID number, though individuals can provide other forms of identification and self-attest to their citizenship. \n\n“There is no evidence of active fraud in that sense or use of that mechanism,” Read said. His office did not respond to questions about the percentage of voters registering at the DMV versus online. \n\nThe president’s directive also orders the U.S. attorney general to take action against states that accept absentee or mail-in ballots after Election Day in their final tabulation of votes for president and members of Congress. It also directs the Election Assistance Committee to block election funding for states that don’t set a ballot receipt deadline on Election Day.\n\nCurrently, 18 states and Puerto Rico accept mailed ballots received after Election Day as long they are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Oregon requires ballots to be received within seven days of the election if they are postmarked on or before Election Day.\n\nState figures show that there were 12,964 ballots received in the seven days after the general election on Nov. 5. That was about 0.6% of the 2.3 million ballots cast. Kamala Harris won 55% of the presidential vote in Oregon, versus 41% for Trump.\n\nThe order’s documentary proof of citizenship requirement signals that the president is not waiting for congressional Republicans to pass their long-anticipated Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, or SAVE Act, which has aimed to do the same thing.\n\nRepublicans have defended that measure as necessary to restore public confidence in elections. Voting in federal elections by noncitizens is already illegal and can result in felony charges and deportation.\n\nVoting rights groups have expressed concerns that the requirement could disenfranchise people. An estimated 9% of U.S. citizens of voting age, or 21.3 million people, do not have proof of citizenship readily available, according to a 2023 report by the Brennan Center for Justice and other groups.\n\nThere are also concerns that married women who have changed their names will encounter trouble when trying to register to vote because their birth certificates list their maiden names.\n\nBarbara Klein, the acting president of the League of Women Voters Oregon, said the organization is confident that elections administrators in Oregon abide by the rules and that the state’s vote-by-mail system is secure and beneficial for all voting residents.\n\n“We have every confidence that our current system provides for all Oregon voters,” she said in an email. “Further, we strongly believe that voters do not need MORE obstacles in having their voices heard.”\n\n - The Associated Press contributed to this story\n\n- Ted Sickinger is a reporter on the investigations team.

It was 2008, and someone in my journalism class had raised the point that, in media and other industries, hiring a diverse team wasn’t just “the right thing to do” but it was also “good for business.” It’s a point that is never far off in a conversation about the “value” of diversity in the workplace. I remember wondering, Well, what happens when it stops being good for business? \n\nIn 2020, after George Floyd was murdered, the term “DEI” became more widely used as a corporate rallying cry in response to anti-Black racism protests. According to a Harvard Business School course, the abbreviation can be broken down into three pillars. Diversity: the presence and participation of individuals with varying backgrounds and perspectives, including those who have been traditionally underrepresented. Equity: equal access to opportunities and fair, just, and impartial treatment. Inclusion: a sense of belonging in an environment where all feel welcomed, accepted, and respected. Taken together, DEI—which is also sometimes referred to as EDIB (equity, diversity, inclusion, and belonging), or IDEA (inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility)—is a lofty, worthy goal: the idea that everyone, no matter their identities and backgrounds, should have a seat at the table, be treated well, and feel like they belong and are worthy of respect and acceptance.\n\nBut I’m hardly the first person to have had questions about the gap between DEI’s promise and how it functions in reality. Activist, author, and academic Angela Davis wondered about it when she spoke at the University of Southern California in 2015: “I have a hard time accepting diversity as a synonym for justice,” she said. “Diversity is a corporate strategy. It’s a strategy designed to ensure that the institution functions in the same way that it functioned before, except now that you have some black faces and brown faces. It’s a difference that doesn’t make a difference.”\n\nToday, DEI programs are being shuttered across North America. Despite my own and others’ cynicism about how DEI is employed, this is an alarming development. Even before US president Donald Trump’s election, a Republican congressman sought to delegitimize the Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, by calling her a “DEI hire.” \n\nI was in the audience at the National Association of Black Journalists convention last year in Chicago when a reporter questioned Trump about whether he would speak up against the supposed smear. Instead of answering her question, Trump repeatedly deflected it by asking her to define DEI. He has since shown very clearly what he thinks of it: after taking office on January 20, he has issued a staggering number of executive orders—at least ninety—some of which are aimed at shutting down diversity, equity, and inclusion programs across the federal government and the private sector, calling them “wasteful” and “radical.”\n\nA quick look into the history of diversity proves this to be false; it’s, after all, a type of inclusion policy that earned (initially only white) women the right to vote, for example. But then again, it’s worth asking the question: For whom, exactly, are today’s ideals of DEI “wasteful” and “radical”? What is radical about the concept of an integrated workforce? If an integrated workforce is radical, what, then, is normal to Trump and his supporters? Here’s the short answer: the modern anti-DEI backlash is really about resegregation and white supremacy. \n\nThe beginning of diversity initiatives is often linked to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, signed into law, following slavery, segregation, and Jim Crow laws, by US president Lyndon B. Johnson. Among other things, it forbade discrimination in hiring, promoting, and firing based on sex and race. Decades later, studies have shown that it’s primarily white women who’ve benefited from anti-discrimination policies. White women’s progress is also evident in executive leadership: while Black and Brown women remain severely underrepresented in C-suites, white women have made significant progress, outpacing all other racial and gender groups, except for white men, in promotions to the highest echelons of leadership. \n\nIn Canada, the beginnings of the institutionalization of DEI can be traced back to the adoption of multiculturalism as an official government policy in 1971—which sought to recognize the diversity of cultural and ethnic groups in Canada. In 1988, the Multiculturalism Act was passed into law, enshrining the responsibility of federal organizations to work toward equal opportunity and advancement in their institutions. The legal framework for respect and support for different racial and ethnic groups is preceded by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982), which provides broad protections against discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age, and mental or physical disability; and Canada’s Employment Equity Act (1986), which mandates federally regulated employers to actively pursue equitable hiring practices and report on their progress.\n\nEven as the principles of fair and equitable treatment have been enshrined legally and theoretically, DEI has often failed to live up to its purported goal. In my own career as a journalist, particularly at the CBC, I saw the gap between the lip service that is paid to “diversity” and how newsrooms operate in practice. In 2019, frustrated with this dissonance, I left my long-time role as a producer at the public broadcaster. \n\nBefore Trump’s re-election, the war against DEI reached all the way up to the US Supreme Court. In 2023, the highest court in the country ended race-conscious admissions, often referred to as affirmative action, at universities like Harvard and the University of North Carolina. The court deemed it unlawful to consider race consciousness in higher education applications—a term that the Hult International Business School defines as being “aware of historic roots and the pervasive, systemic nature of oppression”—and how that has historically impacted access to education. \n\nFor the Supreme Court justices who supported this decision, it was a welcome move back to the original values of a “colour-blind” US constitution. (The US constitution was not, in fact, colour blind: it did not guarantee equal rights to Black people until the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified three years after the abolition of slavery, and hundreds of years later, true equality for Black people is still out of reach.) Outside of the Supreme Court, critics of DEI policies celebrated the move back to so-called colour blindness, alleging that naming racism and white supremacy painted all white people as racist.\n\nThis move undid forty-five years of legal precedent and racial progress. In 1965, Black students accounted for just under 5 percent of undergraduates in America, but according to a paper published in The Journal of College Admission, that percentage had more than doubled by 1998. \n\nHowever, studies have also shown that even when race-based affirmative action policies were in place, wealthy white students still got the most preferential treatment when it came to admissions. A 2019 study published in the National Bureau of Economic Research found that 43 percent of white students admitted to Harvard University were recruited athletes, legacy students, children of faculty and staff, or on the dean’s interest list—largely applicants whose parents or relatives have donated to Harvard. This belies a racist underpinning of the war against DEI: that those who benefit from it are “meritless” and haven’t adequately “earned” their place. It’s illuminating to see how rarely merit is questioned when the benefactors are wealthy and white. \n\nEven removing wealth or athletic ability as a factor paints a clear picture of who is seen to have merit even when they do not have the qualifications. According to multiple studies, it’s race—and, of course, a culture of white supremacy—that puts white people at an advantage in the workplace regardless of their education level, while Black people are less likely to get callbacks from recruiters when they have clearly identifiable African American names. \n\nTo many of those who oppose DEI, there’s an underlying assumption that Black people, women and gender-diverse people, queer people, racialized people, disabled people, etc., are somehow less qualified, less worthy, less capable—and thus would have gotten their jobs only because of their identity. It’s the inverse that’s true: for many of us, we’ve succeeded despite having one or many of these overlapping identity markers. As Mother Jones video correspondent Garrison Hayes said earlier this year: “White men do not have a monopoly on being qualified.” \n\nSo why has the right latched onto DEI so rabidly? As Gabe Schneider of The Objective—a non-profit newsroom examining systems of power and inequity in journalism—says, this is about so much more than the abbreviation, and the media has not been talking clearly enough about what is at the root of the delegitimization: “DEI, taken at its most literal, is ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion,’” he wrote. “But it would be much more useful for journalists to spell out what the administration is doing: resegregation.” \n\nThis long-established skittishness of the media to name things as they are is well documented—using “racially charged” instead of “racist,” for example. “This administration is blatantly blaming desegregation and scapegoating diversity for America’s problems,” Schneider wrote last month. “Some mainstream journalism institutions would treat the idea that the president aims to resegregate the government as opinion. It’s not. It’s a clear reading of the facts.”\n\nIt seems, then, that the biggest critics of DEI are in fact themselves the biggest benefactors of a type of “affirmative action,” their gender and race putting them at a historic advantage against their racialized, disabled, queer, gender-diverse counterparts. As Princeton professor Khalil Gibran Muhammad wrote, “The call for color-blindness and merit is a dog whistle for a return to an America where some white people do not have to compete because the rules are rigged in their favor, just as has been the case for hundreds of years in the country.”\n\nDespite the racist backbone of the anti-DEI movement, there are signs that the supposedly DEI-friendly corners also have their limits. Perhaps most damning of them is that even those tasked with carrying out the mission of doing DEI work can’t name the very privileges that its efforts are meant to be addressing. \n\nLast year, Johns Hopkins Medicine’s vice president and chief diversity officer, Sherita Hill Golden, a Black woman and professor of endocrinology and metabolism, stepped down from her diversity role after receiving fierce backlash for a newsletter she wrote which offered a clear-eyed definition of how “privilege” works. She called it “a set of unearned benefits given to people who are in a specific social group.” She went on to explain that “privilege is characteristically invisible to people who have it. People in dominant groups often believe they have earned the privileges they enjoy or that everyone could have access to these privileges if only they worked to earn them. In fact, privileges are unearned and granted to people in the dominant groups whether they want those privileges or not, and regardless of their stated intent.” \n\nAn account on X called “End Wokeness” shared Golden’s email, which quickly travelled and was widely criticized by the likes of Elon Musk and Donald Trump Jr. She later retracted her definition of privilege, one that she said she “deeply [regretted],” and, two months later, resigned from her diversity role.\n\nThe moment we are in now has further exposed the hollowness of diversity initiatives. Many institutions see the mere presence of racialized, marginalized, and traditionally excluded groups in positions of power as a sign of success. But in her acceptance speech for an honorary degree awarded to her by Spelman College, Princeton professor Ruha Benjamin warned against mere representation. “Our Blackness and our womanness are not in themselves trustworthy if we allow ourselves to be conscripted into positions of power that maintain the oppressive status quo,” she said. “Black faces in high places are not going to save us.” \n\nBenjamin raised the example of Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the Black US ambassador to the United Nations, who repeatedly vetoed motions for a ceasefire in Gaza. In the lead-up to the US presidential election, writer Ta-Nehisi Coates was reported as saying that Harris’s potential presidency would be a “nightmare,” in which she would be “the first Black woman president . . . having 2,000-pound bombs with your name on them dropping on Gaza.”\n\nIn yet another example of the limits of even seemingly DEI-friendly institutions, Benjamin was under investigation by Princeton as of October 2024 for her support of students at the pro-Palestinian encampment on campus. Meanwhile, her institution publicly celebrated her selection for arguably one of the world’s most prestigious honours: becoming a MacArthur Fellowship recipient, also known as the “genius grant.”\n\nIn September, I addressed Carleton University’s School of Journalism and Communications, in a public lecture called “Objectivity, Press Freedom and the Palestine Exception,” naming the journalism industry’s overwhelming skittishness in talking about Palestine and anti-Palestinian racism, which is rarely, if ever, factored into the diversity, equity, and inclusion conversation. \n\nMy talk was followed by a Q&A session hosted by three journalism students, all of whom were racialized young women. They asked me what the solution was. I said that for DEI to actually be meaningful, in practice, it had to challenge the status quo of power and who gets to hold it and wield it. I said that diversity was often nearly ornamental in practice, with industries boasting of racialized, minoritized faces they like to feature prominently on websites and brochures. Diversity, I said, is not decoration. If it’s not challenging deeply entrenched power, diversity is only serving it. \n\nThis application of diversity—one that doesn’t punish those of us who are invited to the table specifically for bringing our perspectives and experiences into our work—of course, flies in the face of the corporatization and co-opting of DEI as a public relations strategy and performative, surface-level representation. \n\nNew York University professor Jay Rosen illustrated this double bind in a series of posts on X last year: “Decades ago, the leadership class in American journalism accepted the argument that real pluralism had to come to their newsrooms, or the journalism would suffer. Or at least, this is what they said to themselves. But the bosses also said this: We can have a diverse and multi-colored newsroom, and maintain the view from nowhere. See the contradiction? Under-represented journalists are to simultaneously supply a missing perspective and suppress it—in order to prove their objectivity.” Given this contradiction, the view from the journalism industry is growing increasingly bleak: more Black and racialized journalists are leaving or are being forced out of the industry.\n\nThis, in a nutshell, is the crazy-making double bind of supporting the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion while simultaneously rejecting and criticizing the co-opting of those principles into DEI as essentially decorative corporate strategy. As the attacks on DEI continue, it’s best we be specific about what it really means and which meaning we really support.\n\nThe exodus of racialized and other traditionally excluded people from government and the press is alarming and a sign, perhaps, that DEI policies didn’t really provide equitable opportunities but merely the appearance of them. But at a time when it feels like the world is being undone and perhaps remade in real time, it’s worth asking a question put forward by Benjamin in a recent interview. When talking about ideals of inclusion, we should consider: What are we all being included into? She remembered how Martin Luther King Jr. began to fear how desegregation efforts in the civil rights era excluded the poor and disenfranchised. He said: “We have fought hard and long for integration, as I believe we should have, and I know that we will win. But I’ve come to believe we’re integrating into a burning house.”\n\nSixty years later, I can’t help but agree.","summary":"The right is latching onto the idea of “merit” as a cover for something darker\n\n\nThe post DEI Was Always Flawed, but the Backlash Is Truly Alarming first appeared on The Walrus.","url":"https://thewalrus.ca/dei-was-always-flawed-but-the-backlash-is-truly-alarming/","image":"https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/WEB_DEI_MAR25.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 10:30:51","author":"Pacinthe Mattar","authors":["Pacinthe Mattar"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.451},{"id":304355056,"title":"Inside Paramount's bumpy sale: the president, a scion and a possible sheikh","text":"Tech scion David Ellison launched his pursuit of Paramount Global nearly two years ago. But the path has been anything but smooth for Ellison and his Skydance Media. President Trump and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr have put Paramount's CBS network under the microscope. Now, the government's review of the $8-billion transaction could stretch into summer, heightening the drama for the embattled company that also owns MTV, Comedy Central and the Melrose Avenue film studio behind \"Top Gun\" and \"The Godfather.\" Paramount investors have cried foul. While the Skydance purchase is pending, Ellison's investor group — including his billionaire father, Larry — has come to the financial aid of Paramount's controlling shareholders, Shari Redstone and her family. The group made a $186-million loan payment on behalf of the Redstones' cash-strapped investment firm. Once the deal closes, the Skydance investors will pay for her private jet and Central Park apartment in New York for a period of time, according to two people familiar with the arrangements who were not authorized to comment publicly. \"They have to get [the deal] approved,\" said Mario Gabelli, a longtime Paramount shareholder. \"Paramount, Hollywood and the world will be better off with Ellison running it,\" Gabelli said. \"It doesn't matter whether they crash or burn or make a ton of money — we just need a change.\" Gabelli and others are eager for a new chapter, but the Skydance deal has turned into a slog, punctuated by presidential theatrics and murky allegations. Investors are demanding answers from Paramount. An obscure group led by a wealthy Beverly Hills human rights activist said it has the means — with support from an Abu Dhabi sheikh — to pay billions more than Ellison for Paramount, including debt restructuring. Meanwhile, President Trump has said he wants \"a lot\" of money to settle his $20-billion lawsuit against CBS over edits to a \"60 Minutes\" interview of then-Vice President Kamala Harris last fall. Carr opened an inquiry into whether the \"60 Minutes\" edits rose to the level of \"news distortion,\" allegations that CBS denies. Last week, Carr told Bloomberg News that Paramount needed \"to get busy\" and dismantle its diversity, equity and inclusion programs for the deal to move forward. Ending DEI programs has been a Trump priority. Carr's support for the deal is critical because Paramount and Skydance need FCC approval to transfer CBS station licenses from the Redstones to the Ellison family. Further, members of Congress and conservative critics have raised national security concerns because Tencent Holdings, a minority investor in Santa Monica-based Skydance, has ties to China's military. Skydance pushed back, saying Tencent would own only about 5% of Paramount nonvoting shares. Investors have flocked to Delaware court, raising questions about the Skydance transaction and its cushy terms for the Redstone family, which holds 77% of the controlling shares in Paramount through its investment vehicle National Amusements Inc. The family is expected to collect $1.75 billion for its Paramount stake and the rest of National Amusements, which also operates movie theaters. Lawyers for New York City workers' pension funds, which own Paramount stock, have filed a class-action lawsuit against Paramount and Skydance. This month, they questioned the Ellisons' loan and future jet payments on behalf of Redstone, calling them \"not typical deal terms.\" Payments made by Ellison will be deducted from the Redstones' eventual sale proceeds, according to a knowledgeable person close to Redstone. If the deal falls apart, Paramount would owe Skydance a $400-million breakup fee. Few expect Skydance's takeover bid to collapse. Observers point to Larry Ellison's prominent support of Trump as Skydance's ace in the hole. Last summer, Skydance and Paramount set an April 7 deadline for the deal to close, according to regulatory filings. After that, either Skydance or Redstone, with support of Paramount's special committee, could walk away, but Paramount would have to pay the breakup fee. The agreement includes two automatic 90-day extensions. The first would expire July 7 — the first anniversary of the deal signing. (David Ellison first reached out to Shari Redstone in mid-2023 when Paramount was reeling from Hollywood's labor strikes. At the time, Redstone turned to a banker to help National Amusements meet its financial obligations. The banker has been instrumental in facilitating NAI's sale.) Representatives of Redstone, Paramount and Skydance declined to comment. Allegations of preferential treatment have long clouded the complicated, two-step deal. The Ellisons and private equity firm RedBird Capital Partners agreed last summer to buy the Redstones' National Amusements. After that, Paramount will buy Skydance at a valuation of $4.75 billion. Critics say that is an inflated price for Ellison's firm. But Skydance and its backers also agreed to pump $1.5 billion into Paramount's battered balance sheet so the company can pay down debt. The arrangement also provides $4.5 billion to buy out shareholders eager to exit. The New York pension funds accused Paramount board members of breaching their fiduciary duty to shareholders by holding an auction that was designed to anoint two winners — Redstone and Skydance, which was granted the right to \"acquire Paramount at a heavy discount,\" according to the funds' complaint. \"The losers? Paramount's public stockholders.\" Shareholders recognized the Redstone family would receive a premium for their controlling shares. The question has been, how much? \"This is Hollywood: 'Show me the money,'\" Gabelli said, borrowing from the 1996 film \"Jerry Maguire.\" The veteran investor, who helped Redstone's father, Sumner Redstone, mount his successful takeover of Paramount Pictures three decades ago, asked a judge to order Paramount to provide financial details of its agreement with Skydance. Gabelli dubbed his firm's effort \"Project Fishbowl.\" \"If Shari gets $40 a share and our shareholders are getting $23, well, that's too big of a discrepancy,\" Gabelli said. \"I'm all in favor of this [Skydance] deal but I want to make sure my clients get a fair price.\" Then a mysterious alternative bidder emerged. In late January, a group called Project Rise Partners said it was prepared to pay $13.5 billion for Paramount, $5 billion more than Skydance's deal. The team, in a letter this month to the FCC, urged the agency to block the Skydance deal. Skydance was furious, saying Project Rise showed up after the auction, which closed in late August after a 45-day \"go shop\" period that was designed to allow competing offers. Project Rise tried to muster a bid last summer but what happened next is in dispute. Project Rise said it tried to enter the bidding but Paramount officials suggested the group go away because Ellison had the inside track. Skydance called the Project Rise offer \"unserious.\" In a letter to the FCC, Skydance lawyers said they had uncovered evidence that Project Rise's bid and the backers it listed in a September term sheet were \"make believe.\" Skydance lawyers alleged in the FCC letter that neither Goldman Sachs nor a fund controlled by an Abu Dhabi sheikh had pledged assistance to Project Rise. Project Rise's Los Angeles attorney, Thomas Watson, said during a hearing in the pension funds case that Skydance's statement was based on \"sloppy research.\" Watson said Skydance contacted an Abu Dhabi sheikh — but he was the uncle of their prospective Middle East advisor with a similar name. \"Skydance reached out to the wrong sheikh,\" he said. The pension funds withdrew their request for the judge to block Skydance's Paramount takeover after the companies and Project Rise told the judge they would provide discovery materials. Project Rise co-Chair Daphna Edwards Ziman acknowledged the \"David and Goliath\" nature of her effort to dislodge Skydance. She is joined by Moses Gross, who manages the Malka Investment Trust, as co-chair. \"We are in danger of losing one of the most iconic companies of the world,\" Edwards Ziman said of Paramount. \"Maybe I don't have standing [but] I just couldn't sit by and watch it go.\" Project Rise will reveal its investors to the Delaware judge, she said. The human rights and children's advocate — who wrote a 2011 thriller, \"The Gray Zone\" — said she was sympathetic to Shari Redstone's plight. Edwards Ziman accused Paramount management of failing the mogul. Edwards Ziman and others have questioned Skydance and its deal partner RedBird's growing influence at Paramount Global — even before the deal closes. In addition to Ellison paying NAI loans, RedBird executive and incoming Paramount president Jeff Shell has held meetings to familiarize himself with operations and the team. Late last year, during a meeting with a high-level CBS executive, he suggested the company needed to resolve Trump's lawsuit, sources said. Project Rise's efforts are expected to fall short. \"The FCC likely will approve the deal, and the company will be sold,\" said C. Kerry Fields, a business law professor at the USC Marshall School of Business. \"While we might not know all the details of Skydance's advances to Shari, it looks they are curing [her debts] so that she can stay alive to do the deal. \"Redstone,\" he added, \"doesn't really have any other alternatives.\"","summary":"'They have to get [the deal] approved,' said Mario Gabelli, a longtime Paramount shareholder.

The administration has withheld $400m in federal funds from Columbia University and has vowed to remove even more if its demands are not met.\n\nColumbia has an endowment of $14.8bn and an annual operating budget of $6.6bn. The cuts amount to roughly 6% of its annual budget – a non-trivial share. In order to keep it, Columbia was instructed to adopt a number of illiberal measures: it must put its Middle East, South Asia and Africa Studies department into academic receivership; change its admissions policies to reduce admits of people from those regions and admit more Jewish students;and grant campus police more power to surveil, detain and remove people from campus without following the usual due process. It must accept permanently heightened restrictions on campus protest and speech and comply with unlawful federal orders to arrest and expel green card holders who have committed no crime, such as Mahmoud Khalil.\n\nI have previously stressed, and I maintain, that the tumult at Columbia University and other elite schools about Middle East policy is of little consequence to the people struggling in the Middle East. However, what Columbia does is of immense consequence to the overall landscape of higher education in the United States because of a phenomenon sociologists describe as “institutional isomorphism”.\n\nIn conditions of genuine uncertainty, with competing tradeoffs and high apparent stakes, institutional leaders often try to defer decisionmaking as long as possible. But circumstances often force someone to make the first move. If that first mover also happens to be an institution others look up to, then those other institutions often rapidly follow suit – assuming that a school like Harvard, for instance, must know what it’s doing. Few university leaders would be faulted for emulating Harvard. Consequently, its policy ends up becoming the de facto policy of most other schools too – starting with elite peer institutions and then trickling down.\n\nWe can see this dynamic at work in university hiring. A couple of non-elite state schools announced a freeze in the wake of budget uncertainty. Then Stanford adopted the policy, and it promptly exploded throughout elite private universities and “public Ivies” such as the UC system. Similar patterns are likely to play out here, too. Other universities are desperate to avoid falling into the Trump administration’s crosshairs, and they’re closely watching how Columbia navigates this situation. This is distressing because, as the Wall Street Journal first reported, Columbia University has conceded to most of the Trump administration’s demands without resistance.\n\nThe “America First” president seems poised to successfully suppress criticism of a foreign country and its policies nationwide under the auspices of fighting antisemitism – a scourge that, while very real and pernicious, is demonstrably less pronounced or accepted on college and university campuses than almost anywhere else in American society. Antisemitism is certainly far less accepted at Columbia than, say, in the GOP, where our sitting president casually decreed that Chuck Schumer is not Jewish any more because he doesn’t accept all of Trump’s policies – and proceeded to call the Senate minority leader “Palestinian” (another semitic population) as a slur.\n\nThis is not a partisan political point. Virtually every aspect of the Trump administration’s posture rests on track laid by the Biden administration and the Democratic party.\n\nFor instance, the reason Trump could plausibly refer to Gaza a “demolition site” is because, for more than a year prior to his re-election, his Democratic predecessor (urged on by Schumer and others) supplied unlimited weapons to Israel to carry out a campaign of destruction that has few modern equivalents – a campaign that was not just restricted to Gaza, but also extended to the West Bank, Iran, Yemen, Lebanon and Syria. Biden’s planned successor, Kamala Harris, and her surrogates repeatedly stressed to voters that these policies would continue largely unchanged under her watch.\n\nEven before Trump had a chance to weigh in, Joe Biden immediately characterized the protests at Columbia as “antisemitic” and declared that “order must prevail” on college campuses. Democratic lawmakers put aggressive pressure on the former Columbia University president Minouche Shafik to crush the protests. She ultimately did so with the assistance of New York City’s Democratic mayor, Eric Adams (who justified his clampdown via evidence-free statements that the protests were driven primarily by “outside agitators”). Trump celebrated the pictures and videos of students getting roughed up by the NYPDand, upon Trump’s reclaiming the White House, the justice department interceded on behalf of Adams – making his criminal investigation go away in apparent exchange for the mayor adopting a more aggressive posture on immigration – a move that critics claim is a quid pro quo.\n\nIn a similar vein, it was Biden who enshrined the IHRA definition of antisemitism into federal guidance, despite the definition’s author repeatedly describing it as a “travesty” to use this definition to regulate speech and behavior. Building on Biden’s introduction, Trump is poised to sign a bill that would implement this same definition into federal anti-discrimination law – and in the meantime, he’s insisting Columbia and other schools adopt this definition in their own codes of conduct. NYU and Harvard have already taken this step, overriding concerns by civil rights and civil liberties organizations – from the ACLU, to Fire and the AAUP, to Israeli civil rights groups – who stressed that IHRA’s definition is extremely vague and provides strong leeway for institutional stakeholders to censor most critical discussion of Israel, Zionism or Judaism more broadly, by Jews and non-Jews alike.\n\nLikewise, before Trump called upon Columbia to put its Middle East studies programs into receivership, New York’s Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, took the extraordinary step of demanding that the City University of New York eliminate a job posting for scholars who study Palestine. This is the same type of overreach Trump is exercising at Columbia – politicians setting the agenda for what can be taught and who can be hired – justified on the same grounds.\n\nThe Democrats will not save colleges and universities. They have been key partners and pioneers for all of the actions currently being undertaken by the Trump administration in this domain.\n\nIf universities are to be saved, they will have to save themselves. And if a desire to preserve academic freedom and institutional autonomy isn’t enough for Columbia University’s leadership, they should perhaps look to its own recent past to see what the wages of compliance are likely to be.\n\nShafik did everything the hardliners asked of her: she threw her faculty under the bus at a congressional hearing, while offering absolutely no defense of her institution and its value. She suspended student groups like Jewish Voice for Peace and Students for Justice in Palestine. She unleashed administrative punishments on protestors, and then siced the cops on them. The school has been turned into a veritable fortress – it’s more secure than a typical military base, as I learned first-hand when I did a series of recent talks there (and I’m speaking as a military brat).\n\nWhat did all this capitulation yield? Still more demands for capitulation! Shafik was driven out. The demonization of the campus has continued apace, and the punishments have ramped up further. The same can be expected for all others who adopt this subservient posture. University leaders should understand that there will be no point at which their compliance is “enough.” The Trump administration seems committed to executing a set of punishments on colleges and universities and espousing particular narratives about institutions of higher learning independent of what colleges and universities say and do in the meantime. The institutions can debase and betray themselves ad infinitum and get the same outcome as if they did nothing. Indeed, even though Columbia has agreed to all of Trump’s demands without contest, the administration has not released any funds, and administration officials suggest still more demands will be made in the near future of Columbia and other universities.\n\nI saw similar dynamics play out after I was dismissed from the University of Arizona following a Fox News smear campaign. I was far from the only scholar who lost a job because of a witch-hunt. Whether the attacks came from the left or the right, university leaders consistently think that if they just give the mob a head it will go away. In fact, it just makes more mobs hungry for more heads. Demonstrating to the mobs that these pile-ons work is a strategy for virtually guaranteeing subsequent pressure campaigns.\n\nThis desire for peace, order, and non-confrontation dominates the academy. Higher ed institutions, in general, are full of people who are risk averse and conformist. People who fall into “leadership” roles are often the most quiescent of all – allowing themselves to get steamrolled by PR teams and lawyers into servile postures, offering limp and half-hearted defenses of the academy and its mission, when defenses are offered at all. To universities’ credit, they recognize this about themselves: most university presidents acknowledge they have done a poor job responding to declining faith in their institutions and the accompanying efforts to impose reforms from the outside.\n\nSmall wonder the public doesn’t trust academia. Not only are we apparently unable or unwilling to address their concerns; we also seem incapable of effectively communicating our own value in society in the face of adversaries out to gut our institutions.\n\nNow is the time to dispense with both of these tendencies. We need to be more explicit about addressing ways our institutions are not, in fact, representing and serving large swaths of the US. However, we also need to be more muscular about pushing back against false narratives, asserting our value to society, and defending our institutions from inappropriate forms of political interference.\n\nInstitutional neutrality, now the rage, is no shield for cowardice. The Kalven Report, the foundational document of this institutional neutrality movement, emphasizes: “From time to time instances will arise in which the society, or segments of it, threaten the very mission of the university and its values of free inquiry. In such a crisis, it becomes the obligation of the university as an institution to oppose such measures and actively to defend its interests and its values.”\n\nWe find ourselves in such a moment now.\n\nIf, in this moment, faculty refuse to make use of the rights and freedoms we have, then it doesn’t matter if they’re stripped away, and they will be. If “academic freedom”, “free speech”, and “viewpoint diversity” organizations have nothing to say to this illiberalism, or even support these moves, they’re worse than useless. If university leaders cannot muster the strength or conviction to decline to follow unlawful and unethical orders and challenge these actions in the courts, then they should resign in disgrace or be pushed out. If we, as a collective, cannot and will not stand against this overreach and defend ourselves in public – then we deserve what we get. But others do not deserve to suffer from our failure. And so, we must not fail.\n\nCritically, any resistance to the administration’s illiberal policies, or defense of our institutions and their mission, must not be framed in banal partisan terms. This is not just a matter of effective praxis (to prevent further polarization and resentment), it’s also a matter of respecting the truth. We got here through bipartisan political actions. Moreover, the chronic failures of our own professions and institutional leaders provided fodder for the “populist” forces now aligned against us. We’ll only get out of this predicament by engaging with those who are currently skeptical of, or alienated from, our institutions.\n\n Musa al-Gharbi is a sociologist in the School of Communication and Journalism at Stony Brook University.

Is it worth listening?","text":"Gavin Newsom has a new political podcast, in case you hadn't heard, and he's not the only one who's talking. California's gallivanting governor has made national headlines and stirred no small amount of discussion among fellow Democrats by undertaking a series of cross-partisan conversations with the likes of MAGA megastars Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon. Our columnists Mark Z. Barabak and Anita Chabria have differing views on what Newsom has accomplished, what his aims may be and whether the governor should even be in the political chat-show business. Here, they hash it out. Barabak: Anita, I've thought long and hard, trying to find something good to say about Newsom's new side gig. Ummm.... Still thinking. The sound quality is decent. I'll give him that. Chabria: Dear lord, are you really going to make me start my day defending Gavin Newsom? I'll admit, I may be the only opinion writer in the U.S. who didn't slam the governor for his new podcast. And I'll stand by what I said in a previous column: The difference between idea and execution on this one is wider than the Gulf of America. The idea of what Newsom means to do (I think) is smart and necessary — reach those voters that sincerely believed (and may still believe) that MAGA is the party of working families, long the territory of Democrats. Many of those voters have left traditional media behind and are getting their so-called information from the podcasts of the Steve Bannons of the world. So wading into that swamp is something Democrats must do — it's little different to me than the many Democrats holding town halls in Republican districts where the representative is doing the DOGE duck-and-cover. Can we at least find some common ground, Mark, that Democrats need to be communicating better, and to a wider audience? Barabak: Common ground, achieved. Yes, Democrats need to broaden their audience and refine their message. Though I'd point out the current cacophony isn't all that unusual for a party out of power. Sorry to inform the frustrated masses, but it's only when Democrats have a 2028 nominee that they'll have a singular voice and vision competing with President Trump and whomever Republicans serve up as their next standard-bearer. I also don't have a huge problem with Democrats sitting down with the Charlie Kirks of the world, as odious as some of his antisemitic, race-baiting and Trump-worshipping comments have been. We could use more of that dialogue and folks willing to step out of their partisan shrink wrapping. That said, I'm not sure why our governor isn't spending more time doing his job — you know, the one he was elected to and is being paid to perform. Wasn't there a bit of a conflagration in Southern California recently? Mightn't that be more important than filling the airwaves with more gaseous blah blah? And if Newsom insists on having those kind of conversations, why not at least call out some of those odious statements or, say, fact-check Bannon's repeated lies about the 2020 election being stolen. Cringy doesn't begin to describe Newsom's fawning performance. There are doormats that aren't as walked over as our prostrated governor. Were you as grossed out as I was? Chabria: It went beyond being grossed out. It was offensive and baffling to hear the leader of California allow so many lies and so much hate to go unchecked. I'm not asking him to jump on his chair and scream in Bannon's face (though that might boost ratings) but a simple \"The 2020 election was not fraudulent\" would be nice. Now, back to the execution part. I agree with you that talking to the Kirks and Bannons is good. I also agree that allowing them to dominate the conversation and spread propaganda unchecked is a disservice to listeners and the Californians he represents — as you point out, he does have a day job. I don't much care about the Democratic Party, but I do care about democracy. Our president is currently challenging the authority of the judiciary to fulfill its duty as a check on presidential power. The IRS has been gutted to the point that experts now expect tax revenue to plummet by $500 billion. Thousands of middle-class federal workers have been fired. The Department of Education may be no more. The list goes on. The point is that, whether the member of the minority party or not, Americans need organized pushback for the good of the country. Whether that takes the form of a peaceful Tesla protest, a red-district town hall or a cringy podcast, I'll take it. Do you see this as a normal political cycle? The Adam Schiff approach of letting nature take its course — that is, waiting for the right moment to strike back hard — as California's junior U.S. senator seems to prefer. Barabak: I'd submit that \"normal\" was last seen leaving town nearly a decade ago, after Trump descended that gold-plated escalator to launch what them seemed like a whimsical bit of self-promotion. Who would have guessed he'd not only go to become president, twice, but emerge as the most dominant and significant figure on the national scene since Franklin D. Roosevelt? These are, as you suggest, fraught and frightening times. I agree it's important to resist, vigorously, the president's authoritarian impulses. It seems this 248-year-old experiment we call American democracy may very well rest in the hands of our highly politicized Supreme Court. That may not be terribly reassuring to many, but the fact is Democrats — a minority in the House and Senate — haven't as much power as some of the more frothing partisans out there presume. It may seem like forever, and lord knows what horrific and lasting damage can be done in the meantime, but voters — the people! — won't have a chance to put the brakes on Trump and his wrecking ball until the 2026 midterm elections. Which brings us to 2028 and back to Newsom. Other than flattering his ego and servicing his notably short attention span, the entire point of the governor's new podcast — the second one he's involved in, by the way — seems to be positioning himself for a full-fledged (as opposed to flirtatious) presidential run. Do you suppose he's helping his cause? Chabria: It remains to be seen. A successful podcast that pulls an untapped audience will be noticed come primary time. A flop that platforms right-wingers? Not so much. Our governor is placing a long-shot bet on a race that's just starting. How do you think it helps or hurts him, White House-wise? Barabak: I don't see it helping. To the contrary, I see a lot of splice-able and dice-able moments that could be used against him in a Democratic nominating contest. To cite just one, Michael Savage, the conservative radio personality, told a long, shaggy story that involved being served a hot dog while traveling on Air One. Proof, Savage said, that Trump was a “very sensitive guy to other people.” \"I agree,\" Newsom eagerly nodded, referring to a president who has demonstrated countless times his empathy could easily fit inside a thimble, leaving plenty of room to spare. Let's face it, Newsom is, as you suggest, a longshot to begin with. Not least because it's hard to see, after Kamala Harris' defeat, his party turning to another San Francisco Democrat as their savior. But there is this consolation: Newsom has nicely positioned himself for one job after his term ends in January 2027.

But it was Trump’s brief utterance that stole the show. He has always had a genius for contagious coinages—even, occasionally, when the language is accidental. (Remember “covfefe”?) “Everything’s computer,” with its compressed and fractured syntax, perfectly evokes the befuddling era we find ourselves in: technology is infiltrating every aspect of our lives—even, with Musk’s DOGE rampage, the workings of the federal government. Tesla is computer; artificial intelligence is computer; politics is computer. Am I computer, too? The phrase instantly became a meme, used to caption everything from clips of “The Matrix” and “Star Wars” to images of Kim Kardashian with a humanoid Tesla robot with which she has lately been staging scenes.\nThe phrase is enthusiastic yet ambivalent. It can be uttered in delight or in fear. Above all, it expresses a kind of bemusement at the tumultuous unknowability of our moment, and in that respect it has something in common with other memes that have gained traction in the first months of the second Trump Administration. As I observed in a column last year, the 2024 election was characterized online by its brain-rot memes, nonsensical collisions of imagery that produced a lot of noise but little coherent impact. (See, for instance: Kamala Harris and brat summer.) Now the brain rot persists, but the underlying subject matter is more dire. We participate in the memes to express our anxiety that whatever is coming next might be even more chaotic than what is already happening.\nAnother recent example: “Trump took egg. Egg gone.” That phrase is the work of Michael Sweeney, a video editor in San Diego who sometimes directs Democratic political ads. He’d been to his local Costco, where shoppers were maxing out a store-mandated allotment of eggs: two packages of sixty eggs apiece. Sweeney grabbed one of the last eggs on the shelves and, on February 4th, reposted a picture of bare shelves to the social network Bluesky with the caption in question, which quickly took on a life of its own. Sweeney told me recently, “Unlike a lot of problems in the government that Trump’s incompetence is causing, this one is very easy to point out and self-evidently a problem even to people who don’t pay attention to politics.” The phrase morphed into “Trump Take Egg” and then became a memetic rallying cry across social media, labelling more photos of empty shelves and graphs of rising egg prices. A taqueria in Virginia used it as an excuse for a buy-one-get-one-free deal on breakfast tacos: “Trump take egg. Brazos give egg.”\nDemocrats have struggled to craft any sort of effective message of opposition to the second Trump Administration. One recent round of video clips featuring the speeches of Democratic senators was roundly mocked for repeating tired talking points. In the absence of anything more galvanizing, the formula “Trump Take _____”—fill in the blank with “egg,” “cancer research,” or “Social Security”—is, as Sweeney put it, “sort of self-consciously stupid but at least feels like you’re landing a punch.” Another favorite target of late is Vice-President J. D. Vance. Vance hadn’t made much of an impression in the new Administration until he helped Trump berate the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, last month in a televised meeting from the Oval Office. Vance sat on a couch, looking something like a petulant child, before practically leaping out of his seat to demand Zelensky “say thank you.” It was Vance’s first breakout public moment as Vice-President, and the meme machine went to work: Vance as Humpty Dumpty; Vance as a toddler with a propeller hat and a lollipop; Vance as a hippie troubadour with a neckbeard and a mop of curly hair. The more bizarre—Vance as the center of a nuclear-bomb explosion—the more apt.\nA version of the same Vance meme first took hold last October when the Republican congressman Mike Collins posted an image of Vance that had been heavily edited (“yassified,” in internet slang) to have stronger cheekbones and a more angular jawline. Collins, for unexplained reasons, had turned Vance into a “Chad,” an online archetype of bro-y masculinity. Then a Los Angeles-based creative named Dave McNamee posted an altered portrait of a chubby-faced Vance, promising, “For every 100 likes I will turn JD Vance into a progressively apple cheeked baby.” He went on to create a feminine Vance, an elderly Vance, a Justin Bieber-ish Vance. Collins’s original post, McNamee told me, “revealed a deep insecurity that the right has about J. D. Vance—that he is not the masculine icon they want to prop up.”\nLiam Grey, the Canadian administrator of various Instagram meme accounts, including one called @dailyvance, for which he collects memes of Vance’s face, compared the Vice-President to “a modern-day Harambe,” referring to the gorilla that was shot and killed, in 2016, when a human child fell into his zoo enclosure. On social media, people photoshopped Harambe into every imaginable scenario, less out of any animal-rights sentiment than as an early expression of online brain rot, the pursuit of viral content for its own sake: the more meaningless the better. The profusion of memes turned Harambe into a sort of internet folk hero, but Vance is no innocent zoo animal; the images of the Vice-President function more like voodoo dolls, casting vengeful spells from afar.\nZach Silberberg, a digital producer in Manhattan who, last July, created a much-shared meme of Vance with slightly shrunken features, interpreted the popularity of Vance memes as a sign of “people feeling powerless.” The new Administration is dismantling the federal government, allying itself with strongmen, and implementing a new McCarthyism. The Vance memes transmute terror into mockery: as Silberberg put it, “This man has an unprecedented amount of access to power. I’m gonna ruin his day just a little bit.” Earlier this month, the journalist Julio Rosas reported that Vance has seen the memes and “thinks it’s a funny trend.” A few days later, the Vice-President himself posted a Vance meme to his account on X, an edit of his face onto Leonardo DiCaprio’s frame in a scene from the film “Once Upon a Time . . . in Hollywood,” in which DiCaprio’s character, an actor, points at a television screen in recognition. In today’s political ecosystem, any form of internet notoriety might be desirable.\nIt’s one thing when political memes are brain-rotted; it’s another when the practice of politics itself seems to be. This week, The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, wrote about being added by mistake to a Signal group chat, titled Houthi PC small group, in which national-security leaders—apparently including Vance; the national-security adviser, Mike Waltz; the deputy White House chief of staff; and the Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, among others—were planning an attack against the Houthis in Yemen. (The White House press secretary denied that war plans were discussed in the chat.) Waltz celebrated the operation’s launch with a fluent string of emojis: 👊🇺🇸🔥. In a display of gallows humor at the sloppiness of the leaders’ theoretically clandestine communication, people online quickly turned those symbols into memes, and renamed their own chats Houthi PC small group. Making war is computer, too. ♦","summary":"We participate in political memes to express our anxiety that whatever is coming next might be even more chaotic than what is already happening.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/resisting-trump-20-with-brain-rot-memes","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/67da2012c284d61db6d3d5f1/16:9/w_2560,h_1440,c_limit/NewYorker_TrumpMemes_finalanimation.gif","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 10:00:00","author":"Kyle Chayka","authors":["Kyle Chayka"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.019},{"id":304287724,"title":"Have Young People Really Turned MAGA?","text":"Democrats were alarmed last spring and summer when polling suggested that voters ages 18 to 29 were softening in their longtime commitment to the Democratic Party. After the November election, when exit polls indicated that Kamala Harris had won the young adult vote by only a slim margin (if that), it seemed that the ground had shifted. A post-inauguration cover story in New York magazine on young Trump supporters partying it up in Washington captured a widespread impression that this was a generational realignment: the rise of a cadre of MAGA youth.\n\nAfter examining new survey data and interviewing more than 100 young adults for a book I’m writing on how politics is reshaping the college experience, I’m doubtful. Young MAGA types may feel newly energized and empowered, but empowerment is different from numerical growth. The data suggest that the swing in young adults voting for Donald Trump did not reflect a major shift in ideology. Rather, the swing seems to have resulted from moderate-to-somewhat-liberal young voters deciding to bet on Mr. Trump out of concern about the state of the economy — and from young moderates and progressives who chose to stay home because they thought Ms. Harris was either too progressive or not progressive enough. This is a point with implications for Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nThe most striking feature of the young adult Trump swing is that it occurred even though there has been no significant recent increase in the proportion of young adults who identify as conservative. Data from the Cooperative Election Study, a national survey with more than 50,000 respondents during election years, show that between 2006 and 2023, about 23 percent of Americans ages 18 to 29 identified as either “conservative” or “very conservative” on average, a number that fluctuated only modestly year to year. The 2024 numbers, which the study’s researchers have shared with me, show no meaningful departure from this pattern. (Despite fears of the influence of a misogynistic online “manosphere,” the ratio of young men to young women who identify as conservative did not change appreciably, either.)\n\nLikewise, the survey registered only modest changes in the political party affiliations of young adults over the past two decades. Young people have been softening in their commitment to the Democrats, but they’ve been softening in their commitment to the Republicans as well. In place of these loyalties a growing number say they are independents.","summary":"Feeling empowered is different from numerical growth.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/opinion/young-maga-trump-vote.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/26/opinion/26gross/26gross-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 09:02:05","author":"Neil Gross","authors":["Neil Gross"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.292},{"id":304276354,"title":"Trump tees up the terror","text":"When Franklin D. Roosevelt began his first inaugural address 92 years ago this month by asserting his “firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself,” he was rallying his countrymen to overcome the paralyzing fear that had settled in after over three years of the Great Depression. That president wanted to ease Americans’ fears.\n\nThis, of course, stands in the sharpest of contrasts with the White House’s current occupant, whose express purpose — expressed in a continual loop — is precisely to induce fear, and not just fear but terror, and not just terror but terror of him in particular. It’s simple: What he intends is to instill fear that if we disagree with him or oppose him or — God forbid — challenge him, we’ll face his retaliatory wrath. He isn’t sheepish about publicizing his expectation that he can frighten Americans into submission; he boasts about it, and he exults in the boasting.\n\nFDR warned Americans not to be fearful. President Donald Trump wants them that way.\n\nThe president’s firing of dozens of federal prosecutors who worked on criminal cases arising from his supporters’ 2021 attempt to block the counting of electoral votes and their assault on Capitol Police officers, and the disciplining of FBI agents who have investigated things Trump doesn’t want investigated, were messages to federal workers, from whom Trump has moved to strip employment protections: Swear allegiance to me, or you may be out of a job. The firing of inspectors general for the Cabinet departments, whose job is to weed out illegal, unethical and corrupt conduct, sent the same message: Do what we say and say what we say, or you’ll be on the street.\n\nIn a speech pointedly delivered at the Justice Department this month, Trump proclaimed that media coverage critical of him was “corrupt” and “illegal.” Those opposing him were “bad people.” Reporters who have criticized him are engaged in criminal activity. And “the people who did this to us should go to jail.” “It has to stop,” he told prosecutors. “It has to be illegal. ... It just cannot be legal. I don’t believe it’s legal.”\n\nThe message to the press that they’ll be punished if they don’t play ball has been received. No media corporation with interests requiring federal approval or with subsidiaries, partners or affiliates subject to federal regulation would be wise to ignore Trump’s threats of retribution. They know it. Trump knows they know it. And they know he knows it.\n\nRather than fight Trump, ABC agreed to pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit he brought against it. Meta has agreed to pay $25 million to Trump to settle a lawsuit he filed against it for suspending him from the platform for using it to make fraudulent representations about the 2020 election. And CBS is reportedly considering settling a $20 billion lawsuit Trump filed against it because he didn’t like the way “60 Minutes” edited an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign.\n\nPronouncements that the federal government will suspend research funding to universities unless they run their campuses the way he wants them to have struck fear into higher education. The universities are scrambling to bend their knees while simultaneously saluting. Executive orders threatening law firms with punitive actions because they promote racial and gender diversity have caused at least one major law firm to race to the Oval Office to cut a deal with the president to provide free legal services to interests he favors in order to escape retaliation. More than a few law firms, rather than stand up to a despot, have opted for a “duck and cover” approach, keeping their heads down rather than risk being the next target of Our Leader’s disfavor.\n\nNot everyone, however, is prepared to kiss the would-be dictator’s ring. Trump’s “border czar,” Tom Homan, recently alleged falsely that Boston police were protecting undocumented immigrants who had committed crimes, and swaggered that “I’m coming to Boston, I’m bringing hell with me.” Boston Mayor Michelle Wu had a response. “No one tells Boston how to take care of our own,” she said last week in her State of the City address. “Not kings, and not presidents who think they are kings.”\n\nThese days, it appears, what Americans should be most afraid of are the consequences of surrendering to the fear deliberately being promoted from the White House.","summary":"The president isn't sheepish about publicizing his expectation that he can frighten Americans into submission; he boasts about it, and he exults in the boasting.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/opinion/columnists/jeff-robbins-trump-tees-up-the-terror/article_81e50f39-efe9-4187-88aa-070cdee157cc.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/ea/bea2cd15-1cbb-41ce-b66c-0c97a6ddba9b/67e2f31eae070.image.jpg?crop=1695%2C890%2C0%2C166&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 09:00:00","author":"Blox Content Management,By Jeff Robbins","authors":["Blox Content Management","By Jeff Robbins"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.114},{"id":304259026,"title":"Glenn Jacobs, WWE legend and Tennessee mayor, willing to do 'anything' for charity wrestling match vs Tim Walz","text":"Glenn Jacobs, the former WWE legend known as Kane who is now serving as mayor of Tennessee, said Tuesday he’s willing to agree to a stipulation to make a pro wrestling-style match against Minnesota Gov.

She ran a decent campaign in 2024 that tried to reverse some of the leftward lurch of her party. She rarely emphasized her race or gender and moderated from the more left-leaning stances she took as a Democratic primary candidate in 2020. But three things dragged her down. First, the Democratic Party is often judged not just by what its leaders say but by the actions of activists, influencers, and academics who have collectively veered far to the left. That trend has been decades in the making, and for many voters, their perceptions of the party were already locked in place. Second, Harris’ ill-fated turn as an ultra-progressive in the 2020 primary dampened the credibility of her 2024 turn toward the center. And third, Harris refused to break with Joe Biden. One of the defining moments of the 2024 campaign came when Harris told the ladies of The View that she couldn’t think of a single thing she would have done differently from Biden. It was an act of political malpractice—Biden was deeply unpopular and when offered a chance to distance herself from him, she refused to do so.","summary":"The party needs to rethink its policies, not its messaging.","url":"https://thedispatch.com/article/democrats-policy-not-messaging/","image":"https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2203339491.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 06:45:00","author":"Jeremiah Johnson","authors":["Jeremiah Johnson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.558},{"id":304319396,"title":"Column: Team Biden's Mistreatment of a Pliant Press Corps","text":"Michael LaRosa was Jill Biden’s press secretary for the first 18 months of Biden’s presidency, and in recent weeks he’s loosened his lips about how Team Joe mistreated a pliant press corps.\n\nIn an interview with Cenk Uygur on “The Young Turks” show, LaRosa admitted: “They did bully a lot of journalists, and I think they would tell you that now. They wouldn’t have told you at the time.”\n\nLaRosa didn’t want to say the reporters were “co-conspirators,” but it’s impossible to see all of their obsequious cooperation with Team Biden and think that word is inappropriate.\n\nUygur asked how they bullied the press, and LaRosa said Joe’s handlers insisted they had to pre-approve the quotes used in stories. That’s helping shape the story, not something an “independent journalist” would accept.\n\nLaRosa added “you saw them get caught trying to script questions to radio reporters\" last summer. They didn’t just “try.” The radio hosts the Bidenites selected were happy to use the pre-scripted questions. LaRosa added: “It was very reminiscent to me of being on the campaign in 2020, where these young press staffers in these states like New Hampshire, or Iowa, or Nevada, they were sort of like dog trained to make the questions conditional for interviews.” Questions had to be submitted for approval.\n\nOn \"Doctor\" Jill Biden’s team, LaRosa said, he told staffers it was “unethical” to require questions before granting access, but they replied it’s what Team Joe (or “the boys team\") required. “These young kids are really taught to make that a part of their sort of pre-pre-screening for interviews.”\n\n“Yeah, it’s amazing to me that no one in the press complained about it,” mused Uygur. The press corps was stuffed with pushovers, from the same leftist press outlets who screamed hostile, un-screened questions at Trump and called it “strengthening democracy.” \n\nUygur wondered: “Did the press ever push back? We couldn’t see the press pushing back at all, until the debate [fiasco].” This underlined how much the press is a megaphone for Democrats, and when the Donkey Party breaks down into two sides, the press will then present both sides.\n\nLaRosa thought maybe the local reporters would be less intimidated by a national campaign. “Like why didn’t any of these reporters even in New Hampshire, and some of these small town papers or local news, like why didn’t anybody ever say anything [about the pre-screening]? I thought it was so weird at the time.”\n\nLaRosa said Team Biden were “operating out of a bunker every day,” and he never understood it because \"there was so much good will that he had with the media” who couldn’t stand Trump. He said the Bidenites were suspicious of all journalists. Or…let's guess they were scared about whatever might tumble unscripted out of Biden’s mouth.\n\nThen came another interesting theme, with LaRosa saying Donald Trump manipulates the media coverage by energetically granting so much access that he becomes the primary source, that he’s “good copy.” Biden’s team made their leader sound tightly scripted and designed to avoid making any waves, so nothing sounded authentic. \n\nThe national media elitists were never independent enough to stand up for its own prerogatives with Biden or with Kamala Harris. These cowardly pols could avoid interviews as aggressively as they desired, and there was no pushback from their supposed foes.\n\nSo we roll our eyes when journalists promote themselves as reliable professionals who are essential to a functioning government. They aren’t the ones who will be “holding government accountable” when it’s the government they all picked on Election Day.","summary":"Michael LaRosa was Jill Biden’s press secretary for the first 18 months of Biden’s presidency, and in recent weeks he’s loosened his lips about how Team Joe mistreated a pliant press corps.\n\nIn an interview with Cenk Uygur on “The Young Turks” show, LaRosa admitted: “They did bully a lot of journalists, and I think they would tell you that now.

Through his distinctive marketing approach, Farlow has revolutionized business operations by developing impactful activations that build authentic relationships between brands and their target audience.\n\nRasheen specializes in cross-industry activations with his portfolio spanning the fashion, sports, and entertainment sectors. His work stands out because he develops experiences that create powerful audience connections leading to important brand partnerships and large-scale cultural authenticity-based events.\n\nFarlow operates as a cultural architect who recognizes that contemporary consumers want authentic relationships. The strategies he has cultivated move past standard product promotion, they develop stories which link brands with the changing cultural environment.\n\nDuring this conversation, Rasheen discusses his career, philosophy, and the future of marketing in an age where consumers want more than just products, they want alignment, experience, and authenticity.\n\nThe Art of Transformation\n\nEvery successful brand isn’t just a business—it’s a story woven into the culture of its audience. For Farlow, the process of linking brands with cultural movements goes beyond marketing. It requires an instinctive comprehension of community identity and experience.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nSamsung Makes Surprise New $203 Offer To Galaxy S24 Buyers\n\nRussia Produces $189 Billion Of Oil A Year.

A brand can’t just sell a product—it has to become part of the culture it seeks to engage with.\n\nA prime example is my work with MCM Worldwide at King of Prussia. When the store opened, it lacked a strong cultural connection to the Philadelphia tri-state area, despite MCM’s legacy in hip-hop, luxury streetwear, and high fashion. I developed a multi-layered strategy that integrated MCM into Philadelphia’s fashion, music, media, and influencer communities. From securing a runway show at Philadelphia Fashion Week to leveraging mainstream media and digital engagement, I made sure MCM became an integral part of the city’s fashion-forward identity.\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13: Rasheen Farlow attends the Concept Korea Spring/Summer 2023 ...

The 32 Stats of Excellence Dinner Series which honored Amar’e Stoudemire’s Phoenix Suns jersey retirement served as a valuable example of how Rasheen’s cultural storytelling can be successfully implemented across different market environments.\n\nStephanie Tharpe: What specific obstacles did you encounter while developing a consistent yet locally relevant experience for the 32 Stats of Excellence Dinner Series?\n\nRasheen Farlow: The challenge was ensuring each city—Phoenix, New York, and Miami—received an immersive, culturally resonant experience while keeping Amar’e’s legacy at the center. Partnering with STK Steakhouse as the hospitality provider allowed for a seamless high-end experience across cities, but we went deeper than just venue selection.\n\nI designed a storytelling-driven guest experience, incorporating a 32 Stats of Excellence list throughout each venue, developing signature cocktails inspired by Amar’e’s career, and crafting a social media strategy that extended engagement beyond the events. Each dinner wasn’t just a gathering—it was a cultural activation.\n\nStrategic Partnerships: The Key to Brand Longevity\n\nFarlow believes partnerships should produce meaningful connections that create real value instead of serving only as brand promotion tools.\n\nStephanie Tharpe: You’ve secured partnerships with the Philadelphia 76ers and Maker’s Mark. What steps did you take to identify and cultivate these collaborations?\n\nRasheen Farlow: I focus on three principles: cultural and brand alignment, mutual value creation, and long-term relationship building. Take my collaboration with the 76ers—this wasn’t just about putting a logo courtside. I orchestrated a viral cultural moment when Roc Nation artist Freeway’s song What We Do was performed on the jumbotron during an NBA Playoffs Game 2 timeout. That moment became an ongoing cultural reference, even repurposed as a viral meme celebrating Kamala Harris after Joe Biden’s presidential win.\n\nWith Maker’s Mark, I ensured their partnership with the Fashionably Late Awards Dinner Series wasn’t just about sponsorship—it was about authentic integration. The partnership positioned them as a key player in recognizing cultural pioneers, elevating both the brand and the event’s prestige.\n\nMeasuring Impact Beyond the Metrics\n\nRasheen directs his efforts toward establishing long-term impact due to the fleeting nature of virality that exists in our current media landscape.\n\nStephanie Tharpe: How do you measure the success of your brand partnerships and cultural activations?\n\nRasheen Farlow: Impact isn’t just about metrics—it’s about how people engage and remember an experience. When I worked on exclusive screening events for Lawman Bass Reeves and Ava DuVernay’s Origin, I ensured they weren’t just film screenings but immersive cultural moments. A tribute video we produced for Ava, featuring heartfelt messages from attendees, resonated so deeply that she personally commented, \"This moves me more than you know.\"\n\nBut engagement alone isn’t enough—successful activations must drive business growth and consumer loyalty. Whether through luxury hospitality partnerships or high-impact retail campaigns, my work ensures brands don’t just capture attention—they sustain relationships.\n\nMarketing executive Rasheen Farlow accepting award\nRasheen Farlow\n\nThe Future of Marketing and Cultural Engagement\n\nConsumer behavior is shifting—people are now choosing to invest in experiences that match their values.

And that’s because I’m gay and that’s because I have my opinions, but that doesn’t mean I’m completely like, I don’t know everything about every topic I have opinions on, like being gay.”\n\n The “Pink Pony Club” artist continued, “Like, I don’t know everything about being a woman. I don’t know everything about fucking fashion or drag or performing. I try to know everything I can, but when I don’t answer a question correctly or I don’t acknowledge one community, it’s like, how can I do it all? How can these girls tour, write, perform, interview, sleep, eat and workout? And how can they do all and lead a team and be a boss and pay people and be like fucking so politically educated.”\n\n Roan has previously faced backlash for saying she’s casting her vote for Kamala Harris but not endorsing the former vice president ahead of the 2024 presidential election. She’s also ignited discourse following her plea for health insurance for recording artists during her 2025 Grammys speech.\n\n Elsewhere in her interview on Call Her Daddy, Roan shared how her interactions with fans have changed since calling for personal boundaries amid concerning behavior she’s experienced from fans during her rise in fame.\n\n “I think people are scared of me,” she confessed. “I think I made a big enough deal about not talking to me that people do not talk to me. That’s, I think, the truth of it all, and I’ve been with people, like friends who are artists, and when they’re with me, they’re like, ‘It’s a force field around us. People don’t come up to me if I’m with you.’ I’m just like, ‘Damn, baby. You say it too. You say, don’t touch me, don’t touch me. Don’t look at me, don’t touch me. I don’t know who you are,’ and they won’t come up and bother you.”\n\n The “Good Luck, Babe!” singer noted that she knows “it really hurts people ’cause they feel like it’s me disrespecting them, that I owe it to them and that how dare I call it abuse or complaining about success,” but that she has to protect herself first.\n\n “I’m not complaining about success,” Roan added. “I’m just complaining about creepy behavior. I love admiration. Everyone loves admiration. I just don’t want you to interrupt me when I’m having a fight with my girlfriend. Don’t be like, ‘Can I get a photo?’ when I’m crying, talking to my girlfriend? That’s fucking crazy.”\n\n During her conversation with Cooper, the “Hot To Go!” artist also revealed that she’s been in a “serious” relationship for six months.\n\n “I haven’t dated someone since this all really, really blew up,” Roan admitted. “I’m dating the same person that I was dating before I like blew up, so I’m not sure how I would date now. I think it would actually be a nightmare. I think I would be so single right now because you’re terrified of their intentions. I’m scared. I’m scared. I don’t trust anyone. I just think in my head, I’m like, any new person that I’m texting, I’m like, ‘I’m assuming they will screenshot this and send it to someone else.'”\n\n At the end, she also teased new music, saying her new single “The Giver” is “not the only song” on the way.\n\n The past year has been a whirlwind for Roan after skyrocketing to fame following the release of her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, in September 2023. Earlier this year, she won best new artist at the 67th Grammy Awards.","summary":"During her 'Call Her Daddy' podcast interview, the Grammy-winning singer also reveals she's in a \"serious\" relationship.","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/chappell-roan-call-her-daddy-expections-fans-privacy-dating-1236172853/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chappell-Roan-Call-Her-Daddy-publicity-H-2025.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 04:21:21","author":"Carly Thomas","authors":["Carly Thomas"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.118},{"id":304189816,"title":"Pilot Reveals Incredible Scene After Discovering Plane Crash in Alaska","text":"George Clooney has said on screen romance is dead for him because, at 63, he can’t compete with younger leading men.

On Truth Social, he criticized the actor for his political views. “Why would the now highly discredited 60 Minutes be doing a total ‘puff piece’ on George Clooney, a second rate movie ‘star,’ and failed political pundit,” Trump wrote.

It directed federal agencies to share data with states to help them identify noncitizens on their rolls.The order said if states refuse to collaborate with federal law enforcement to prosecute election crimes, they could potentially lose out on federal grants.Mail ballots by Election DayThe executive order required votes to be \"cast and received\" by Election Day and said federal funding should be conditional on state compliance with that deadline.According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 18 US states along with Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Washington, DC, will count ballots that are postmarked on or before Election Day, regardless of when they arrive.Ballots can't rely on QR codesThe order instructed the Election Assistance Commission to amend its guidelines for voting systems to \"protect election integrity\". That would include guidance that voting systems should not rely on ballots that use barcodes or QR codes in the vote-counting process.Trump instructed the commission to “take appropriate action to review and, if appropriate, re-certify voting systems” under those new standards within six months of the order.Foreigners barred from making donationsDonald Trump's order also barred foreign nationals from contributing or donating in US elections.\"Foreign nationals and non-governmental organizations have taken advantage of loopholes in the law's interpretation, spending millions of dollars through conduit contributions and ballot-initiative-related expenditures.

But it’s not infallible. And its shortcomings and limitations are precisely why its use by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top Trump administration defense officials has rocked the worlds of politics and national security. The app made headlines Monday after Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg published the bombshell news that the Trump administration had accidentally added him to a Signal group chat this month to discuss military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. At first glance, it might not seem a major problem. Cybersecurity experts widely consider Signal to be the leading easy-to-use encrypted messaging service, and there are no public reports of its ever having been compromised by hackers. Signal’s encryption protocol — the complicated algorithm that scrambles messages as they’re sent, then descrambles them for recipients — is the basis for some of the most popular messaging apps, including WhatsApp and iMessage. In 2023, Signal began updating its encryption to address the hypothetical threat of a quantum computer that could break less complicated encryption codes. But Signal can’t protect people, even Cabinet members, if they accidentally tell it to message the wrong person, said Mallory Knodel, the founder of the Social Web Foundation, a nonprofit organization that has helped social media networks in the fediverse implement encryption. “Signal is as secure as it gets for end to end encrypted messaging, but this leak was because they added an untrusted party to the chat,” she told NBC News over Signal. According to the Atlantic article, Goldberg was seemingly added to a Signal group chat that included sensitive national security discussions among Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and national security adviser Mike Waltz. Goldberg described the discussions’ continuing for six days before he removed himself, all while the rest of the group appeared to be unaware that he was in the chat. Goldberg chose not to publish what appeared to be highly sensitive, classified information, including the name of a high-ranking CIA official included in the chat and some specific details about the military operation. A Signal spokesperson declined to comment. Discussing sensitive military matters over smartphone group chats is far outside normal protocol, regardless of the messaging app. Military coordination is usually done over one of two government systems: a more routinely used system called the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, or SIPRNet, for communications deemed to be secret, and one called the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System, or JWICS, for top-secret ones. Both networks operate as isolated communications systems not connected to the larger internet, making them less vulnerable to hacks and attacks. Signal uses end-to-end encryption, which is designed for a specific threat: that someone, perhaps a government or law enforcement officer, might intercept a message as it travels between one person’s phone to another’s. End-to-end encryption scrambles information in transit so that receivers of that information can’t unscramble it unless they have a specific code. The app doesn’t rely on a single code to descramble information; instead, it creates a new code for every account. Even if Signal receives a court order to decrypt a user’s message, it wouldn’t be able to comply. When hackers who the United States says work for Chinese intelligence broke into telecommunications companies around the world last year, including the American companies AT&T and Verizon, they got access to conventional SMS text messages on some accounts. That led to the remarkable warning in December from some federal officials, including the FBI, that Americans should use encrypted messaging apps if they wanted to stay private. But that’s where the usefulness of Signal — or of any encrypted messaging app — ends. Just because Signal protects messages in transit doesn’t mean it protects its users from other types of snooping. A person who gains full access to a person’s unlocked phone, either remotely with sophisticated hacking software or by physically acquiring it, can simply read a decrypted Signal message. That’s the root of the concern of the commercial spyware industry, in which companies lease powerful malicious software, like Pegasus, that hacks entire phones. While companies that offer that technology often say they lease it to governments only for national security uses, researchers have long documented that authoritarian regimes use the technology to spy on activists, journalists and political opponents. While such spyware isn’t widely deployed against most people, top government officials are some of the biggest targets for governments and intelligence agencies engaged in espionage. Last year, for example, a Chinese hacking campaign targeted the phones of Donald Trump, Vance and then-Vice President Kamala Harris. “Signal protects against outside snoops listening in on your private conversations,” Riana Pfefferkorn, an encryption policy expert at Stanford University, told NBC News. “It doesn’t protect against the risk of outsiders accessing the device where you’re using the app. If a phone has been hacked and has spyware implanted on it, then your messages and other files on the device could be getting read without your knowledge,” she said. A memo sent to Defense Department staff members last week warned about using Signal, citing a Google report last month that Russian intelligence has increasingly tried to trick Ukrainian Signal users into sharing personal information or giving the spies access to their Signal accounts. Signal offers a feature whereby users can sync their accounts with other devices, like second phones or laptops. One method that Google said Russian intelligence services have deployed is to systematically try to trick Ukrainians into syncing their Signal accounts with phones controlled by the Kremlin. The report cited no examples of Signal’s being compromised.","summary":"Signal, the most secure widely available messaging app, has become a go-to resource.

Good riddance!”\n\nO’Donnell also said that she wrote an apology to Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin for the interaction with Trump at the White House earlier this month when a reporter asked him about her move to his country: “Why in the world would you let Rosie O’Donnell move to Ireland? I think she is going to lower your happiness.”\n\nBefore Martin could reply, Trump said, “That’s true. I like that question. Do you know you have Rosie O’Donnell? Do you know who she is? You’re better off not knowing.”\n\nThe former co-host of “The View” also knocked Trump signing an executive order Thursday to shut down the Department of Education.\n\n“He disbanded the Department of Education, and I have a child who has autism and that child will be denied services and many, many autistic children because the funding for these programs for special needs children comes from the federal government as well as the states,” O’Donnell said. \n\nShe added that the closing of the department would “be disastrous for children on the spectrum,” calling it “terrifying.”\n\nIn response to a comment request from Fox News Digital about O’Donnell’s concerns, the White House highlighted a Friday post from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

In 2021, the team’s 2020 World Series title was celebrated by President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. This time, the Dodgers will be welcomed by President Trump — which, given past comments some team members have made, raised questions in the wake of Tuesday’s announcement about whether anyone might decline to take part in the event. Roberts said he would participate, despite comments he made to The Times in 2019 indicating he might not go to the White House if Trump — who was notoriously critical of Roberts’ managing on Twitter during the 2018 World Series — was president. “I respect the position,” Roberts said Tuesday, confirming his attendance for next month’s trip. “It’s the highest office in our country certainly, in the world. So I’m looking forward to it.” Kiké Hernández also said he was planning to go, something he said in 2018 he was unsure he would have done had the Dodgers won the World Series the previous year. Hernández, who was not with the Dodgers for their 2021 White House visit after signing with the Boston Red Sox the previous offseason, noted this year might be his last chance to experience a White House trip. Mookie Betts, on the other hand, said he was undecided if he would make this year’s White House visit, and that he needed to talk it over with his family first. After winning his first World Series title with the Red Sox in 2018, Betts skipped their trip to the White House the following year during Trump’s first term, along with Boston manager Alex Cora and All-Star teammate pitcher David Price. Betts did take part in the Dodgers’ visit in 2021 with President Biden. During Trump’s first term, several sports teams, including the Golden State Warriors and Philadelphia Eagles, did not make White House visits amid a threat of boycotts from their players. Leading up to Tuesday’s announcement, however, Roberts said there “wasn't a formal conversation that we had as a ballclub” about whether the Dodgers would make a White House visit this year. The team’s statement noted it was “keeping with long-standing baseball tradition” by visiting the White House. Baseball teams have made White House visits as far back as the 19th century, and championship winners in all sports began receiving regular invitations during Ronald Reagan’s presidency in the 1980s. Roberts was asked Tuesday about a recent baseball-related controversy involving the Trump administration. Last week, the Department of Defense removed — before later republishing — an article from its website detailing Jackie Robinson’s history of military service in what appeared to be part of the administration’s stance against diversity, equality and inclusion initiatives. Roberts said he was “happy that the page went back up” but didn’t offer any further opinions. “I have my strong opinions on DEI and all that stuff,” he said, “but that's another scrum.\" In addition to their White House visit on April 7, Dodgers team members also will visit Capitol Hill on April 8.","summary":"The Dodgers will visit the White House at the invitation of President Trump on April 7, when the team is in town to play the Nationals.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2025-03-25/dodgers-white-house-president-trump-visit","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/927be40/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4279x2246+0+303/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F32%2F8c%2Ffb3809e1426287a1cc0810ed540e%2Fbiden-20594.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 00:13:25","author":"Jack Harris","authors":["Jack Harris"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.123},{"id":304137442,"title":"Democratic U.S. senate hopeful says her party nixing Rogan interview is why people are ‘turning against’ it","text":"One of the Democratic Party’s up-and-comers is telling her colleagues what they can do to stem their bleeding support. Democratic Michigan state senator Mallory McMorrow told Politico in a new interview this week that the party needs to occupy prominent cultural spaces like Joe Rogan’s podcast to reach voters. She noted that snubbing these opportunities because of political differences contributes to the impression that the party is \"elitist.\" \"Instead of snubbing your nose at those people, which is the perception that a lot of people have of Democrats, is that we’re elitist and we’re academic, and we look down on people who don’t watch traditional Hollywood movies or engage in mainstream media — that’s the perception, and that’s why people are turning against Democrats,\" McMorrow said. NEWSOM, PRITZER, BUTTIGIEG, AMONG THE DEMOCRATS MAKING EARLY 2028 MOVES Politico portrayed the \"Rising Democratic Star\" – who is reportedly prepping a run for U.S. Senate in Michigan in 2026 – as someone who can bring a fresh perspective to a Democratic Party that is struggling following its electoral defeat at the hands of President Donald Trump. The Democratic Party is currently suffering some of its worst polling in decades. According to national polls from CNN and NBC News published earlier this month, just 29% and 27% of respondents, respectively, say they view the party favorably. These represent the lowest approval numbers for the party surveyed by those outlets since the early '90s. McMorrow first gained notoriety in 2022 after a clip went viral of her impassioned rebuttal to a Republican colleague went viral on the floor of the Michigan State Senate after that colleague accused her of \"grooming and sexualizing children\" because of her opposition to a parental rights bill. One of the suggestions McMorrow gave was that the party needs to convey \"authenticity\" and do that by meeting people \"everywhere.\" MEDIA, DEMS CELEBRATE TESLA WOES AS ANGER OVER ELON MUSK'S ROLE IN TRUMP ADMIN CONTINUES \"Democrats have to start being unafraid to go everywhere and meeting people where they are,\" she said while mentioning \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" Former Vice President Kamala Harris famously missed an opportunity to go on Rogan’s show just before the election. The Harris team reportedly maintained that bad timing during the height of her campaign season sunk the interview, while Rogan has insisted he gave Harris ample opportunity to fit in a sit-down. Either way, McMorrow said not going on programs like Rogan contributes to the impression that the Democratic Party is above ordinary people who watch the popular podcast. \"You have to be willing to go into spaces that may feel a little bit uncomfortable, and be willing to have maybe three-hour long podcast conversations, or go into a dive bar or go into a bowling alley,\" she said. \"People have really good bull---- detectors. They can tell when you’re giving talking points and you’re trying to be buttoned up,\" she said. \"And this is a moment where I think people want to vote for people that they like and people that they trust, and they’re not going to like you or trust you if they don’t feel like they know who you are, and that’s much bigger than just your job or your title.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"Democratic Michigan state senator Mallory McMorrow said in a new interview that her party needs to occupy more popular cultural spaces so it doesn&apos;t come off as &quot;elitist.&quot;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/democratic-u-s-senate-hopeful-party-nixing-rogan-interview-people-turning-against","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/08/931/523/GettyImages-2166798144.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 00:00:53","author":"Gabriel Hays","authors":["Gabriel Hays"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":304129078,"title":"President Trump makes surprising announcement regarding Travis Kelce and Kansas City Chiefs","text":"Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs did not win the 2025 Super Bowl but it appears they will still make an appearance at the White House after the President alleged he had invited the team.\n\nThe winner of the Super Bowl always receives an invite to the White House for the ceremonial event, although the Chiefs were not able to make it in 2020 due the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThey attended in 2023 and 2024 when President Joe Biden was in office. \n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl in February 2025, beating the Chiefs with a resounding 40-22 victory.\n\n\"I look forward to having the Eagles,” he told founder of the sports website Outkick, Clay Travis, adding: \"And one other thing, we’re going to have the Kansas City Chiefs after that, because they missed their turn because of COVID.\"\n\nHe did not say what date the team had been invited to attend, and the Chiefs have not yet commented.\n\nDespite rumors that the Eagles had turned down an invite from the President, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed their upcoming visit earlier in March.\n\n\"April 28, I can confirm that the Philadelphia Eagles will be here at the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl victory,\" she told press.\n\n\"I know there was a lot of fake news about an invitation that wasn’t sent or was sent. We want to correct the record. We sent an invitation, they enthusiastically accepted, and you will see them here on April 28.\"\n\n In 2018 the Eagles turned down the invitation to meet Trump.\n\nPatrick and Travis never endorsed a candidate but Clay revealed that Trump said he \"loved\" Brittany Mahomes and Randi Mahomes, Chiefs' quarterback Patrick's wife and mother, who are both \"big fans\" of the President.\n\n\"I love those two women, they’re so great and so loyal,\" Trump said.\n\nBrittany's support for Trump was revealed in 2024 when her account liked an Instagram post which laid out talking points Trump would be focusing on in the closing weeks of the campaign, including a large-scale \"deportation operation,\" preventing \"World War III,\" \"canceling electric vehicle mandates,\" and \"keeping men out of women's sports\".\n\nBrittany never publicly endorsed a candidate, but her silence spoke volumes, and in response to criticism she called those who questioned Trump's ultra-conservative social vision \"haters\".\n\nTravis' girlfriend Taylor Swift endorsed President Joe Biden in 2020, and was seen in her 2020 documentary Miss Americana telling her family that she \"had to be on the right side of history\" by speaking out against Marsha Blackburn, the Republican candidate for senate from Tennessee, who was supported by Trump.\n\nShe also endorsed Kamala Harris in 2024, writing: \"I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.\"","summary":"Chiefs did not visit the White House in 2020","url":"https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/822411/president-trump-makes-surprising-announcement-travis-kelce-kansas-city-chiefs/","image":"https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/2caf6910e271-gettyimages-2204326270.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-25 23:11:43","author":"Rebecca Lewis","authors":["Rebecca Lewis"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.221}]}
