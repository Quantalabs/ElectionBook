Here's a Wish List for 2026.","text":"Listening to the usual legacy media suspects, one might think 2025 was an apocalyptic wasteland of sorts -- an authoritarian fever dream brought on by the return of Donald J. Trump to the Oval Office. The reality looked very different. This past year was, in many ways, a pretty great and clarifying one. Let's take stock of what happened when our government remembered whom it serves, as well as what unfinished business remains as we flip the calendar.\n\n First, the obvious: Political sanity was restored to the nation's capital. After years of leftist elite-driven chaos -- wide-open borders, hyper-vindictive lawfare, fecklessness on the world stage, and more -- the nation has begun to revert back to first principles: national sovereignty, law and order, and strong leadership abroad. Under Trump, the United States has once again acted like a real nation-state that pursues its real interests -- not a nongovernmental organization with a nagging guilt complex.\n\n That reorientation has paid huge dividends. On immigration, the Biden-era invasion at the southern border has tapered by more than 90%. On energy, a renewed embrace of domestic production has led to the lowest average national gas prices in nearly five years. Violent crime, thanks to Trump's law enforcement operations and innovative use of the National Guard, has dramatically fallen: Murders decreased by nearly 20% from 2024, and robbery and burglary also saw double-digit percentage decreases. Abroad, allies and adversaries alike recalibrated to the reality that the White House once again means what it says.\n\n Still, work always remains. Here, then, is my 2026 wish list.\n\n 1. Peace in Eastern Europe. The Russia-Ukraine war has gone on far, far too long. The Trump administration has exerted tremendous diplomatic effort trying to orchestrate a peace deal, which thus far remains elusive. A durable peace -- one that halts the senseless slaughter on both sides, respects Ukrainian sovereignty and accommodates legitimate Russian concerns, and avoids a wider great-power conflagration -- should be a paramount Trump administration foreign policy goal in 2026. Russia is the invader, and Vladimir Putin is the greater obstacle to a lasting peace, but both sides need to make painful -- if, frustratingly, also painfully obvious -- concessions.\n\n 2. Victory on Birthright Citizenship. Back home, a consequential legal battle now sits before the U.S. Supreme Court: the Trump administration's righteous challenge to the erroneous practice of constitutionally \"required\" birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children of illegal aliens. The notion that the 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, was meant to constitutionalize a global human trafficking magnet -- granting automatic citizenship to all children born here, including those whose parents entered the country illegally -- is indefensible as a matter of plain constitutional text, the congressional history in the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and basic common sense. Indeed, birthright citizenship has been nothing short of ruinous for the United States. A Trump administration victory would restore Congress's rightful authority over circumscribing citizenship and remove a longstanding incentive for illegal immigration.\n\n 3. Improved Affordability and Housing Costs. Legal victories mean relatively little if ordinary Americans continue to feel like they are getting squeezed. Improved affordability must be front and center in 2026 -- from the federal level down to states and localities. The cost of living is not an economic abstraction; it affects rent, groceries, child care and the difficulty of buying a first home. Housing, in particular, demands attention. Housing policy should reward supply, not suffocate it -- cutting red tape and burdensome construction fees, reforming zoning incentives, and curtailing the inflationary spending that puts upward pressure on mortgage rates. A nation where young families cannot afford to put down roots is a nation courting decline -- the very antithesis of Trumpian restoration.\n\n 4. Justice for Minnesota Somali Fraud Scandal. The burgeoning massive fraud scandal over state and federal funds for child care in Minnesota, involving many businesses run by Somali immigrants, has become a test case for whether the rule of law still applies when politics get uncomfortable. Justice means following the facts wherever they lead: recovering stolen taxpayer dollars and holding wrongdoers and abettors legally accountable without fear or favor. To wit, on the subject of abettors: What did Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), Atty. Gen. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and other prominent Minnesota politicians know, and when did they know it? Moreover, what did Kamala Harris -- who picked Walz as her 2024 presidential running mate -- know, and when did she know it? The American people deserve answers to all these questions.\n\n 5. Tamed Communist China. Finally, no wish list can be complete without confronting the central geopolitical challenge of our age: that of Communist China. Simply put, Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party, who just presided over their largest live-fire military exercises around Taiwan, must be meaningfully deterred in the Indo-Pacific. That means maintaining a combative tariff posture, implementing as much economic decoupling as is feasible, and emboldening key regional allies -- such as Japan -- who share America's interest in freedom of maritime navigation and diminished Chinese hegemony. Decades from now, Trump's presidential legacy will be partially defined by how he handled the China challenge. Now is not the time to take the foot off the gas pedal.\n\n This past year showed what is possible when Washington rejects the politics of managed decline and reembraces the best of the American tradition and way of life. Let us hope we will see more -- a lot more -- of that same success in this new year.\n\n To find out more about Josh Hammer and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists, visit the Creators Syndicate website at www.creators.com.\n\nEditor's note: We now have the room to run syndicated commentary by some of our favorite and most provocative thinkers on the Right.

A loud call came back from the crowd: 'Ted Cruz!'\n\nCruz, 55, who was runner-up to Donald Trump in the 2016 Republican primary, paused his speech for several seconds and chuckled. He declined to respond directly to the call for him to run again in 2028 but, increasingly, many Republican insiders believe he is at least maneuvering toward the starting gate.\n\nAccording to a new Daily Mail/JL Partners poll, Cruz, and a myriad of other potential 2028 contenders, will have an uphill struggle - but that's not to say they won't try.\n\nThe poll gives Vice President JD Vance a massive 38-point lead among Republican primary voters.\n\nHe has the backing of 49 percent, with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis a distant second on 11 percent, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio third with five percent. Cruz and Vivek Ramaswamy are in joint fourth with four percent.\n\nHowever, two years before the presidential primary, no lead is unassailable and the prospect of an open primary, not with as many contenders as 2016 but some serious players, remains realistic.\n\nThere are expected to be two main sources of support - the MAGA base, and the more traditional wing of the party with a less isolationist foreign policy. There's also a strain of the party who will be searching for a fresher face - someone who may not even be on the radar of most Republicans right now. \n\n'Vance actually has converted to a much greater extent [to MAGA] than Rubio has,' one insider told the Daily Mail. 'He's seen as the real thing. He's hardcore.'\n\nWhile this insider complimented Marco Rubio as 'sharp' and 'thoughtful,' the current secretary of state is most likely seen as a Vance ally in the run-up to 2028. \n\n'He wants to be Vance's VP. Remember, that means Hispanics on the ticket,' the insider added.\n\nThat could mean Rubio taking a run at the White House as late as 2036, when he would still only be 65, young by current presidential standards.\n\nHowever, others are watching Vance closely, and putting themselves in position to run in case a path opens up.\n\nWhile the polls are with the vice president, history is not.\n\nThe last incumbent vice president to be elected president was George H W Bush in 1988, and the one before that was Martin Van Buren in 1836. Joe Biden and Richard Nixon were former vice presidents when they won the White House.\n\nOne former senior Trump official told the Daily Mail: 'There's no doubt Vance has a head start as vice president, but I think it's a head start, I don't think it's locked in by any stretch of the imagination. I think there'll be a big open field within the Republican Party, I think a lot of people are interested.'\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail poll, no potential female Republican contender earned more than three percent support.\n\nFormer Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley secured three percent, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem two percent and Congresswoman Elise Stefanik one percent, but each could eye a run if they see an opportunity. \n\nVance had particularly high support among female Republican primary voters, with 54 percent backing him compared to 45 percent of men.\n\nIt comes after Vance recently went nuclear at commentators who insulted his wife Usha.\n\n'Let me be clear, anyone who attacks my wife, whether their name is Jen Psaki or Nick Fuentes, can eat s***,' Vance said, referencing former Biden press secretary Psaki, and far-right influencer Fuentes.\n\n'It says a lot to people, here's a guy who believes in true love, I've heard people say that,' Professor Larry Sabato, Director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, told the Daily Mail.\n\n'He's got a soft side, I think brought on by having a young family. Women don't make up the large majority of the Republican [primary] vote that they do on the Democratic side, but they make up about half in most places and they're going to be more sympathetic, they're going to be more pro-Vance because of Usha's presence.'\n\nIn his corner, Vance will also have the formidable backing of the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk's political machine Turning Point USA, which would help get out the vote in the wintry, rural first-voting primary state of Iowa.\n\nDuring the group's annual AmericaFest conference just before Christmas, Kirk's widow Erika endorsed Vance.\n\n'There are few endorsements that really matter, but I think hers [Erika Kirk's] does,' said Sabato.\n\nVance also won Turning Point USA's recent straw poll for the Republican nomination in 2028 with 82 percent of the vote. His margin of victory was bigger than Trump's in the same poll in 2024. \n\nAbsent unforeseen crises - and there are two years to go before Iowa - Vance is almost certain to inherit the MAGA mantle.\n\nOthers have tried to reinvigorate the traditional wing of the party and failed, a lesson Haley learned the hard way in 2024.\n\nHowever, there was recent encouragement for such candidates from an NBC News poll, which asked Republicans whether they considered themselves more a 'member of the MAGA movement' or a 'supporter of the Republican Party.' The result split 50-50, having been 57 percent MAGA and 43 percent traditional Republican in April.\n\nThose who read the Washington tea leaves believe Cruz could be the next Republican who tries to ride that wave.\n\nHe has been vocal in his warnings against isolationism, particularly the growing criticism of Israel among some prominent conservative figures including Tucker Carlson.\n\nWhile he has publicly praised Trump, sources claimed to the Washington Post that Cruz has privately told Republican donors that Vance's foreign policy views are too isolationist.\n\n'Cruz would be crazy not to do this. This is his last shot,' one Washington insider told the Daily Mail. 'You always prepare yourself to run for the position if circumstances enable you to do so. And one circumstance would be an unpopular Trump.'\n\nCurrently, Trump remains overwhelmingly popular within the party but if that fades toward the end of his presidency it could open the door for Cruz and a host of other senators and state governors to enter the 2028 race.\n\n'If Trump is still at 80 to 85 percent approval among Republicans, no way,' said Sabato assessing the likelihood of a strong challenge to Vance. 'If Trump becomes unpopular [with Republicans] and the economy is a mess, then yes, everybody, and his brother and sister will be on the train.'\n\nVance's team has repeatedly said he is not yet looking ahead to 2028, and is focused on his current position.\n\nHis team declined the Daily Mail's request for comment on the polling results.\n\n'We're going to do everything that we can to win the midterms, and then after that, I'm going to sit down with the president of the United States and talk to him about it,' Vance said recently.\n\nIf Cruz were to run, it may well spur others to do so, as they may feel they have more allies within the Republican Party than he does.\n\nThe feeling was summed up succinctly by Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who recently fell out with President Trump. She told the Washington Post: 'There'll be Ted Cruz, I'm sure, running against JD Vance. All of us hate Ted Cruz.'\n\nAnother potential landmine for Vance is the libertarian wing of the party.\n\nRepublican Senator Rand Paul has criticized Vance's position on trade and tariffs.\n\n'Now all these pro-tariff protectionists, they love taxes, and so they tax, tax, tax, and then they brag about all the revenue coming in. That has never been a conservative position,' Paul told ABC News.\n\nAsked if Vance met that criteria of the traditional Republicans, he bluntly replied: 'No.'\n\nWhen the Daily Mail poll includes the current president's eldest son Donald Trump Jr in a hypothetical 2028 Republican primary, Vance's support falls from 49 percent to 38 percent – but he still remains in first place.\n\nHowever, the president's son has been clear he has no ambitions to run for president, especially given that he is personally close with Vance and helped convince his father to place him on the 2024 ticket.\n\nA well-connected Iowa strategist suggested that Vance could face a primary challenge from the right in, possibly from an unexpected candidate claiming to be the true MAGA successor through even greater loyalty to Trump's causes.\n\n'There may be two MAGA lanes. Will someone try to outflank the vice president?' the strategist told the Daily Mail. 'Some fresh faces, maybe not the ones being talked about now, might decide they want to take a swing at it.'\n\nBut Cruz will also be standing in the way of an insurgency. The Texan defeated Trump in the 2016 Iowa caucuses and would start with strong relationships formed in the evangelical community. \n\nRon DeSantis, who finished second in both the Daily Mail poll and the 2024 Iowa caucuses, appears less likely to run again, according to the Iowa strategist.\n\nIf the Daily Mail poll came to fruition, it sets up a 2028 general election between Vance and former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBut front-runners at this early stage usually don't end up as their party's nominee.\n\nHarris, who lost the popular vote and Electoral College to Trump in the 2024 election, has the support of 30 percent of her party's voters.\n\nBut a fellow Californian, Governor Gavin Newsom, is hot on her heels, with 21 percent of support in the Democratic primary and appears ascendant. \n\nIn a recent speech, Vance forecasted that Democrats are likely to nominate a Californian in 2028 - but he stopped short of naming which one.","summary":"Vice President JD Vance is poised to take over the MAGA empire in 2028 with 49 percent of likely Republican voters saying they want him as their next presidential candidate.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15406127/JD-Vance-lead-Republican-nomination-2028.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/22/19/104952679-0-image-m-14_1766433364815.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 19:49:35","author":"Editor,Katelyn Caralle Senior U.s,Nick Allen","authors":["Editor","Katelyn Caralle Senior U.s","Nick Allen"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.134},{"id":391216492,"title":"Democrats Claim Maduro Capture Is A 'Distraction'","text":"Democrats immediately denounced President Trump's operation that resulted in the capture of Venezuelan socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro, calling it an illegal war despite broad precedent supporting the commander-in-chief's authority to conduct such missions without congressional approval.\n\nEven former Vice President Kamala Harris has chimed in.\n\n\"Donald Trump’s actions in Venezuela do not make America safer, stronger, or more affordable,\" Harris claimed in a post on X. “That Maduro is a brutal, illegitimate dictator does not change the fact that this action was both unlawful and unwise. We’ve seen this movie before. Wars for regime change or oil that are sold as strength but turn into chaos, and American families pay the price.”\n\nOther Democrats claimed that the operation to capture Maduro was a “distraction.”\n\nDuring an appearance on MSNOW on Saturday, Rep. Marilyn Strickland (D-Wash.) suggested the timing of Maduro's capture served primarily as a distraction from issues Democrats plan to spotlight when Congress reconvenes, namely the upcoming anniversary of the Capitol riot on January 6, and the Epstein files.\n\n\"I think it was mentioned by one of your earlier speakers that Donald Trump is transactional, what he wants is access to those oil reserves,\" Strickland said. \n\n\"At the same time, this is also a big distraction. Look at the timing of this. We go back in session on Tuesday. We are going to talk about the Affordable Care Act premiums. We're going to talk about January 6, the Epstein files, the economy, all those things that are so important to the American people, and, what a coincidence, this happens.\"\n\nShe also drew a comparison between Maduro and Trump regarding election integrity.\n\n\"It also is not a surprise of the timing. We're going back to Congress next week... and we'll be talking about January 6, which is kind of ironic here, because...Maduro, he actually did steal two elections. And Donald Trump tried to do that on January 6, but he failed,\" Strickland said.\n\nStrickland wasn’t the only one pushing the “distraction” angle.\n\n \"It's not about drugs. If it was, Trump wouldn't have pardoned one of the largest narco traffickers in the world last month. It's about oil and regime change,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) claimed. \n\nAnd they need a trial now to pretend that it isn't. Especially to distract from Epstein + skyrocketing healthcare costs,\" she wrote.\n\nHowever, these accusations ignored a glaring contradiction. \n\nThe Trump administration carried out an operation targeting a leader the Biden-Harris administration actively sought to apprehend. \n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken announced on January 10, 2025, mere days before Joe Biden and Kamala Harris left office, that the State Department would increase the reward to $25 million for Maduro.\n\n“In solidarity with the Venezuelan people, the U.S. Government and our partners around the world are taking action today,” Blinken announced in a statement on January 10, 2025. \n\n“The Department of State is increasing the reward offers to up to $25 million each for information leading to the arrests and/or convictions of Nicolás Maduro and Maduro’s Minister of Interior Diosdado Cabello. The Department of State is also adding a new reward offer of up to $15 million for Maduro’s Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López. These three reward offers stem from criminal narcotrafficking indictments announced in March 2020.”\n\nBiden's outgoing administration framed the increased reward as part of coordinated international pressure on the illegitimate Maduro regime.\n\nIt appears that the only distraction going on here is from the Democrats, who don’t want the public to realize that Trump succeeded where Biden-Harris failed.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/democrats-claim-maduro-capture-distraction","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2026-01/1qZh6QP3z_M6dlNSrVf0R-A.jpg?itok=Y6RO7DA6","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 18:25:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":391198610,"title":"Tantrums, Tarmac Cash, Trump Boycotts, and a French-Fried Clooney: RedState's Week in Review","text":"Welcome to the RedState Weekly Briefing — where we take a quick look at the week’s most viewed stories in case you missed any of them.

But it's Tim Walz, who has no sense and can't read the room. So, of course, he went to Default Mode #1 and....blamed President Donald Trump. This was one for the books. \n\n#2 - Former TSA Agent Exposes Somali Fraud in Real Time at Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport — by Jennifer Oliver O'Connell\n\nLike County Highway and City Journal, Alpha News has been reporting on Minnesota's fraud for longer than people have been paying attention. In early December, before Nick Shirley's videos exposing Somali daycare fraud went viral, Alpha News' Liz Collin Reports interviewed a former TSA employee named Liz Jaksa. Jaksa worked for TSA at the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport from 2016 to 2021. In her tenure, Jaksa noticed a consistent pattern and particular people coming through the TSA checkpoints. Years later, Jaksa recognized that this was the now-exploding fraud happening in real time during her time with TSA. \"Since all this fraud came out, the connection's been made,\" Jaksa told Collin. \"I didn't feel good about it then, and now it certainly all makes sense.\"Jaksa said she was shocked to see \"suitcases filled with millions of dollars cash. And the couriers were always Somali men traveling in pairs. And they got through the checkpoint.\"\n\n#3 - Ric Grenell Offers Shocking Explanation Why Artists May Be Bailing on Their Trump-Kennedy Center Gigs — by Teri Christoph\n\nSomehow, Trump's name being added to a building has silenced \"human voices\"? It should be noted that Trump didn't silence anything; it's The Cookers who have abandoned their fans. And they're not the only ones, with country singer Kristy Lee walking away from her January gig in order to, in her own words, keep her integrity intact, and the Doug Varone and Dancers troupe canceling their April date because they can no longer \"step inside this once great institution.\" Again, that's their choice.Now, there are all kinds of reasons why performers may need to cancel gigs – such as illnesses and family emergencies, or, as we've seen, political temper tantrums and Trump Derangement Syndrome – but Ric Grenell has made a blockbuster claim as to why some of these recent cancellations could be happening: meddling from CNN and The Washington Post.\n\n#4 - Bari Weiss' Response to Clooney's Attack - C’est Magnifique — by Katie Jerkovich\n\nIn a recent Variety interview, Clooney claimed that Weiss was “dismantling CBS” amid his wider critique of the network's settlement with President Donald Trump over its deceptively edited 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris.Weiss responded to Clooney’s attack in a statement to The New York Post, inviting him to come to her place of work for a tour to learn about the news business. Ouch.“Bonjour, Mr. Clooney! Big fan of your work,” Weiss statement shared by the CBS parent company Skydance read. “It sounds like you’d like to learn more about ours.”\n\n#5 - Angry Wisconsin Business Owner Finds Out: Leave Politics at Home — by Ward Clark\n\nThis brings me to Wisconsin, and a man named Chad Kodanko, who was the co-owner of a small local restaurant and, apparently, an angry leftist.On Dec. 12, Husby's Food & Spirits employee Robert Meredith says he left his Charlie Kirk sweatshirt on a hook at work.\"Somebody had told me, 'Hey, where is your hoodie at?' I was like, 'I don't know -- probably at my house?'\" Meredith said. \"He said, 'No, it's probably not.'\"Meredith says he wasn't provided many details, but was told Husby's co-owner, Chad Kodanko, burned his Kirk sweatshirt.\"It was talking politics in a bar and led to that, which is never good,\" said Meredith, who also says he was told there is a video of the incident, but he has not seen it.Let's apply a little position reversal thought experiment, here. Imagine if this were a Republican business owner (or co-owner). Imagine if an employee came in, not protesting, not shouting out his political opinions, but just wearing a Bernie Sanders hoodie. He doesn't wear it while working; he just hangs it on a hook and goes to work. Imagine then that the Republican business owner takes that hoodie and burns it in front of several employees. Imagine the outcry.When worn on the other foot, the shoe pinches. But this time, the shirt-burner did face consequences, possibly costly ones.\n\nIf you enjoy the Weekly Briefing, be sure to check out RedState Radio, our weekly podcast.

As anticipated, Harris criticized President Trump’s actions, aligning with the views of some left-leaning commentators who argue that the capture was unlawful.\n\nHarris took to the social media platform X on Saturday to express her opinion, employing the familiar argument that while “Maduro is a bad guy,” there are reasons he should not have been apprehended.\n\n“Donald Trump’s actions in Venezuela do not make America safer, stronger, or more affordable,” Harris stated, despite assertions that the operation enhanced U.S. security and demonstrated its strength.\n\nShe added, “Although Maduro is a brutal and illegitimate dictator, this action was both unlawful and unwise.” Harris drew parallels to past conflicts, saying, “We’ve seen this scenario before—wars for regime change or oil that are presented as strength but result in chaos, for which American families bear the cost.”\n\nHarris concluded by asserting, “The American people do not want this, and they are tired of being misled.”\n\nDIVE DEEPER: Trump Announces Venezuelan Leader Nicolas Maduro and His Wife Captured Following ‘Large Scale’ US Strike\nThat Maduro is a brutal, illegitimate dictator does not change the fact that this action was both unlawful and unwise.

The low-I.Q. Wine Mom who defended the withdrawal from Afghanistan, which infamously resulted in the death of 13 U.S. service members and wounded dozens more, specifically because the Biden-Harris administration had no coherent plan, has some thoughts on troop risks and exit strategy. \n\nThank goodness this woman is not sitting in the White House right now.\n\n“America needs leadership whose priorities are lowering costs for working families, enforcing the rule of law, strengthening alliances, and — most importantly — putting the American people first,” she concluded.\n\nHarris, of course, was part of an administration that did the exact opposite of every talking point in that last sentence.\n\nAside from the vapid response, Kamala has a slight issue in the previous administration to contend with. While she’s out here condemning Trump for capturing Maduro, it was former President Biden who, in one of his last moves in office, announced a $25 million bounty for information leading to the arrest of Maduro.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration made available a $25,000,000 reward for information that would have lead to the arrest of Nicolas Maduro.\nNow you’re saying capturing him was unlawful?

To nobody's surprise, she condemned President Trump's actions and echoed leftist agitators' sentiments that the strongman's capture was illegal.\n\nHarris posted her thoughts to X late Saturday. They included the oft-used trope that 'Maduro is a bad guy ... but here's why he should have been allowed to roam free.'\n\n\"Donald Trump’s actions in Venezuela do not make America safer, stronger, or more affordable,\" she said, despite the fact that the Maduro takedown undoubtedly makes America safer, while the operation demonstrated our nation's clear strength.\n\n\"That Maduro is a brutal, illegitimate dictator does not change the fact that this action was both unlawful and unwise,\" the former vice president continued. \"We’ve seen this movie before.

The low-I.Q.

I made it clear and we left it at that,” Mamdani said, giving no details of what Trumps response to him was.The extraordinary international development has come just two days after Mamdani was sworn-in as New York City Mayor.Mamdani was briefed Saturday morning by his administration officials, including his chief of staff and the police commissioner, on the US military capture of the Venezuelan president and his wife, as well as their planned imprisonment in federal custody here in New York City.Mamdani said the “blatant pursuit of regime change” impacts New Yorkers, including Venezuelans who live in the city.“Unilaterally attacking a sovereign nation is an act of war and a violation of federal and international law,” the newly sworn-in mayor said in a statement.“This blatant pursuit of regime change doesnt just affect those abroad, it directly impacts New Yorkers, including tens of thousands of Venezuelans who call this city home. My focus is their safety and the safety of every New Yorker, and my administration will continue to monitor the situation and issue relevant guidance,” Mamdani said.Harris said the operation was driven by oil interests and not by concerns over drugs.In a post on X, Harris said Trumps actions in Venezuela would not make the United States safer and warned that forced regime change could destabilise the region, putting American lives at risk.Donald Trumps actions in Venezuela do not make America safer, stronger, or more affordable.

America needs leadership whose priorities are lowering costs for working families, enforcing the rule of law, strengthening alliances, and, most importantly, putting the American people first, she wrote.US Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a post on X that Maduro and Flores have been indicted in the Southern District of New York.Maduro has been charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices against the US.“They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,” Bondi said, as she thanked Trump for “having the courage to demand accountability on behalf of the American People, and a huge thank you to our brave military who conducted the incredible and highly successful mission to capture these two alleged international narco traffickers”.Meanwhile, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said while Maduro is an “illegitimate dictator” who has inflicted immense suffering on the Venezuelan people, that reality does not give any president a blank check to use military force without Congress authorisation.“By acting without congressional authorisation and publicly asserting US control over another sovereign nation, President Trump is abusing presidential power and undermining the Constitutions separation of powers,” Krishnamoorthi said.He said the Trump Administration must immediately account for the safety of US personnel, disclose whether there were any casualties and fully and immediately brief Congress.“The president has now stated that the United States will run Venezuela, committing the country to open-ended responsibility. Neither the American people nor Congress approved that course. This use of force and claimed control erode the rule of law, embolden Moscow and Beijing to push boundaries elsewhere, weaken Americas credibility, and ultimately make Americans less safe,” Krishnamoorthi said.With inputs from ANI","url":"https://www.rediff.com/news/report/not-drugs-or-democracy-but-kamala-mamdani-slam-trump-over-venezuela/20260104.htm","image":"https://im.rediff.com/1600-900/news/2026/jan/04trump-venezuela-strike.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 11:34:23","author":"Hemant Waje","authors":["Hemant Waje"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.311},{"id":391176686,"title":"'Unlawful, unwise': Maduro's capture is about oil, not drugs or democracy, says Kamala Harris","text":"Former Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris on Saturday condemned the President Donald Trump administration’s latest operation in Venezuela, where they captured the country’s President Nicolas Maduro and his wife.

The couple is set to be tried on charges of drug trafficking stemming from a 2020 narcoterrorism indictment filed during the first administration of Donald Trump.Earlier, Trump and the US Attorney General made the announcement on social media that Maduro and Flores would face “the full wrath of American justice on American soil, in American courts,” warns US Attorney General. The indictment accuses them of drug trafficking, terrorism-related offences, and weapons charges.Amid the dramatic escalation, multiple world leaders and international bodies raised concerns over whether the action complied with international law.The United Nations voiced serious alarm over the U.S. military action. In a statement issued by UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric, the organisation said that António Guterres was “deeply alarmed by the recent escalation in Venezuela, culminating with today’s United States military action in the country, which has potential worrying implications for the region.”“Independently of the situation in Venezuela, these developments constitute a dangerous precedent,” the statement said. It stressed the need for full respect for international law, including the UN Charter.The Secretary-General expressed deep concern that the rules of international law had not been respected and urged all parties to engage in inclusive dialogue in line with human rights and international legal principles.Under U.S. law, Congress holds the power to declare war, though the president serves as commander-in-chief. Past presidents from both parties have justified limited military actions as necessary to protect national interests.International law, however, generally prohibits the use of force in international relations except under narrow circumstances, such as self-defence or authorisation by the UN Security Council.Legal experts say drug trafficking and gang-related crimes do not meet the international threshold of armed conflict that would justify military intervention.“A criminal indictment alone doesn’t provide authority to use military force to depose a foreign government,” said Matthew Waxman, a professor of national security law at Columbia University. He added that the administration would likely attempt to justify the action under a self-defence theory.The U.S. has not recognised Maduro as Venezuela’s legitimate leader since 2019, following an election Washington said was rigged.U.S. authorities said the Justice Department had sought military assistance to apprehend Maduro, who was indicted by a New York grand jury along with his wife, their son, two political allies, and an alleged leader of an international gang. The charges relate to terrorism, drug trafficking, and weapons offences.Attorney General Pam Bondi said on social media that the defendants would soon face justice in American courts.However, during a press conference, Trump offered a broader justification, accusing Venezuela of stealing U.S. oil interests. He said Washington planned to reclaim those interests and indicated that the United States would run Venezuela for a period of time, though he provided no specific details.International law experts said these statements blurred the legal basis of the operation.“You cannot say this was a law enforcement operation and then turn around and say now we need to run the country,” said Jeremy Paul to Reuters, a constitutional law professor at Northeastern University. “It just doesn’t make any sense.”Following Maduro’s detention, Venezuela’s Supreme Court ordered that Vice President Delcy Rodríguez assume the role of acting president. According to a report by Reuters, the court said Rodríguez would take over “the office of President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela” to ensure administrative continuity and national defence.Rodríguez, a lawyer and diplomat, has held several senior roles under Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chávez. She previously served as Minister of Communication and Information, Foreign Minister, and President of the Constituent Assembly.Former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris sharply criticised Trump’s actions, calling the operation driven by oil interests rather than concerns over drugs or security.In a post on X, Harris said the move would not make the United States safer and warned that forced regime change could destabilise the region.“Donald Trump’s actions in Venezuela do not make America safer, stronger, or more affordable,” she wrote. “That Maduro is a brutal, illegitimate dictator does not change the fact that this action was both unlawful and unwise.”New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani also condemned the operation, calling it an act of war and a violation of international law.“Unilaterally attacking a sovereign nation is an act of war and a violation of federal and international law,” Mamdani said in a post on X, confirming that Maduro and Flores were expected to be held in federal custody in New York.Hours after the military operation, Trump said the United States would temporarily run Venezuela and tap its vast oil reserves to sell to other nations. The announcement capped months of covert planning and pressure by the Trump administration and marked the most aggressive U.S. effort at regime change since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.","summary":"The United States has captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife in a military operation to stand trial on U.S. drug trafficking charges, an action drawing international legal concerns.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/maduro-captured-did-the-us-flout-international-law","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/maduro-captured-did-the-us-flout-international-law-1767513477550-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 07:58:03","author":"Vanshika Punera","authors":["Vanshika Punera"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.239},{"id":391120126,"title":"Prayagraj: ‘Magh Mela’ 2026 #Gallery","text":"International\n\nSouth Cinema\n\nSocial News XYZ Reviews\n\nMovie Schedules\n\nMovies News\n\nLive Events\n\nMotorsports\n\nOther Sports\n\nScience/Tech\n\nBusiness Wire India\n\nEnvironment\n\nHome » Gallery » Other » Prayagraj: ‘Magh Mela’ 2026 #Gallery \n\nPrayagraj: ‘Magh Mela’ 2026 #Gallery\n\nPosted By: Social News XYZ\nJanuary 4, 2026\n\nPrayagraj: An aerial view of devotees taking a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam in the Prayagraj district of Uttar Pradesh, Sunday, January 04, 2026.(Photo: IANS/X/@SwachhKumbh)\n\nPrayagraj: An aerial view of devotees taking a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam in the Prayagraj district of Uttar Pradesh, Sunday, January 04, 2026.(Photo: IANS/X/@SwachhKumbh)\n\nFacebook Comments\n\nAbout SocialNewsXYZ\nAn Indo-American News website.It covers Gossips, Politics, Movies, Technolgy, and Sports News and Photo Galleries and Live Coverage of Events via Youtube.\nThe website is established in 2015 and is owned by AGK FIRE INC.\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPrevious post\n\nKolkata: 7th Edition of Ekal Run #Gallery\n\nPrayagraj: ‘Magh Mela 2026’ #Gallery\n\nActress Rhea Singha Glam Stills From Jetlee Movie Glimpse Launch\n\nJetlee Movie Glimpse Launch – Gallery\n\nGandhi Talks Movie HD Stills\n\nMumbai: Fadnavis, Shinde Attend Mahayuti Meeting #Gallery\n\nAgartala: Protest Over Tripura Student’s Death #Gallery\n\nKagyu Monlam Concludes in Bodh Gaya #Gallery\n\nMumbai: Sadanand Date Takes Charge as Maharashtra DGP #Gallery\n\nPort Blair: Amit Shah Chairs MHA Committee Meeting #Gallery\n\nTop Stories\n\nAAP’s Raghav Chadha hails Centre’s draft social security rules as milestone for gig workers\n\nTrinamool to reach out to Bengal personalities with Mamata govt’s report card of past 15 years\n\n‘Kind of economic sanctions’: Prithviraj Chavan on BCCI direction on Bangladeshi player (IANS Exclusive)\n\nWorking with local governments, law enforcement to remove illegal content: X Corp\n\nSIR in Bengal: ECI to set up 160 ‘special decentralised hearing centres’ for marginalised communities\n\n‘Not about drugs or democracy, it’s about Trump’s desire to play regional strongman’: Kamala Harris\n\n‘World wants to know if democracy is alive in India’: Prithviraj Chavan defends Rahul’s frequent foreign visits (IANS Interview)\n\nBengal SIR: ECI gets 1,90,463 applications for inclusion of new names during hearing sessions\n\n‘Special thanks to BCCI’: BJP leader welcomes move on Bangladeshi cricketer\n\nDelcy Rodriguez appointed Venezuela’s Interim President after Maduro’s ‘capture’\n\nArchives Archives\n\nCopyright 2026 | AGK FIRE INC|\nTerms of Service / Privacy Policy | Contact Us","summary":"The post Prayagraj: &#8216;Magh Mela&#8217; 2026 #Gallery appeared first on Social News XYZ.","url":"https://www.socialnews.xyz/2026/01/04/prayagraj-magh-mela-2026-gallery-3/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.socialnews.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04/20260104026f-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1663&quality=80&zoom=1&ssl=1?v=1767511944","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 07:32:43","author":"Social News XYZ","authors":["Social News XYZ"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.498},{"id":391120086,"title":"Cairo: Super Moon Scenery #Gallery","text":"International\n\nSouth Cinema\n\nSocial News XYZ Reviews\n\nMovie Schedules\n\nMovies News\n\nLive Events\n\nMotorsports\n\nOther Sports\n\nScience/Tech\n\nBusiness Wire India\n\nEnvironment\n\nHome » Gallery » Other » Cairo: Super Moon Scenery #Gallery \n\nCairo: Super Moon Scenery #Gallery\n\nPosted By: Social News XYZ\nJanuary 4, 2026\n\nCairo: This photo taken on Jan. 3, 2026, shows the super moon above the Saladin Citadel in Cairo, Egypt.

In a sharply worded post on X, Harris warned that the move risks destabilising the region while putting American lives and resources at stake. \"Donald Trump's actions in Venezuela do not make America safer, stronger, or more affordable,\" Harris wrote, accusing the president of misleading the public. While acknowledging Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's record, she added, \"That Maduro is a brutal, illegitimate dictator does not change the fact that this action was both unlawful and unwise. We've seen this movie before. Wars for regime change or oil that are sold as strength but turn into chaos, and American families pay the price.\" Harris said public support for such actions is lacking. \"The American people do not want this, and they are tired of being lied to,\" she stated, arguing that the rationale behind the operation has been deliberately distorted. In one of her strongest remarks, Harris asserted, \"This is not about drugs or democracy. It is about oil and Donald Trump's desire to play the regional strongman.\" She further alleged hypocrisy in the administration's approach, saying, \"If he cared about either, he wouldn't pardon a convicted drug trafficker or sideline Venezuela's legitimate opposition while pursuing deals with Maduro's cronies.\" Harris warned of the long-term consequences, writing, \"The President is putting troops at risk, spending billions, destabilizing a region, and offering no legal authority, no exit plan, and no benefit at home.\" She concluded by outlining what she believes should be the country's priorities: \"America needs leadership whose priorities are lowering costs for working families, enforcing the rule of law, strengthening alliances, and — most importantly — putting the American people first.\" Her remarks come amid dramatic developments on the ground. In an early morning operation on Saturday, US Delta forces attacked an army base in Venezuela, capping months of military buildup, and captured Maduro along with his wife, Cilia Flores. According to US officials, the two were placed aboard a warship and transported to New York, where \"narco-terrorism\" charges have been filed in federal court. The indictment, made public by US Attorney General Pam Bondi, was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. Prosecutors allege Maduro used state power for more than two decades to move massive quantities of cocaine toward the United States. He faces charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, firearms offences and related crimes, with alleged conduct spanning from around 1999 through 2025. The court filing claims Maduro \"sits atop a corrupt, illegitimate government\" that relied on military, intelligence, and law enforcement institutions to protect drug trafficking routes. Thousands of tons of cocaine were allegedly shipped through the Caribbean, Central America, and Mexico. The indictment also names co-defendants, including Cilia Flores, Maduro's son Nicolas Ernesto Maduro Guerra and some senior officials.

He portrayed the operation as both a legal reckoning and a defining geopolitical moment.'Maduro and Flores have been indicted in the Southern District of New York for their deadly narco-terrorism campaign against the United States and its citizens,' Trump said. 'And the United States is prepared to run Venezuela until a safe, proper and judicious transition can take place.'Trump praised US military forces for what he described as their 'speed, power, precision and competence', saying they worked in close coordination with law enforcement. He contrasted the operation with past US interventions he characterised as failures, arguing that the United States was now 'respected again like never before'.He said Venezuelan forces were aware an operation was imminent but were 'completely overwhelmed and very quickly incapacitated'. No American service members were killed and no US military equipment was lost, despite the deployment of aircraft, helicopters and ground forces, he added.'If you'd seen what I saw last night, you would have been very impressed,' Trump said. 'It was an incredible thing to see.'Trump Says US Will Remain Until Transition Is SecuredTrump was explicit in confirming that Washington intends to remain directly involved in Venezuela's governance until it is satisfied a transition has been firmly secured. He repeatedly stressed that the United States would not risk another failed handover of power.'We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,' he said. 'We can't take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela who doesn't have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind.'Trump said the objective was to deliver peace, liberty and justice, including enabling Venezuelans who fled abroad to return home. He argued that previous international efforts had failed because they were rushed and lacked enforcement mechanisms.Oil And Economic Control At The Heart Of Trump's PlanVenezuela's oil industry featured prominently in Trump's remarks, with the president describing it as 'a total bust'. He said major US energy companies would be brought in to rebuild infrastructure, restore production and stabilise the economy.'We're going to have very large United States oil companies go in, spend billions of dollars and start making money for the country,' Trump said. He claimed such partnerships would make Venezuela 'rich, independent and safe'.Trump linked the collapse of Venezuela's energy sector to organised crime, asserting that drug trafficking routes ran through the country and that US maritime operations had already disrupted most narcotics entering the United States by sea.He also warned that the United States was prepared to escalate militarily if necessary. While planners had anticipated a second, larger wave of attacks, Trump said the initial operation had exceeded expectations.'We are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so,' he said. 'This was pinpoint, but we have a much bigger wave.'Narco-Terrorism Claims And Legal ProcessTrump accused Maduro of personally overseeing a vast criminal network, describing him as the 'kingpin' of the Cartel de las Soles. He said the group trafficked large quantities of drugs into the United States and was responsible for the deaths of 'countless Americans'.'Maduro and his wife will face the full might of American justice and stand trial on American soil,' Trump said.Global And Political ReactionsInternational and domestic reactions followed swiftly. French President Emmanuel Macron said he had spoken with Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado and voiced full support for efforts to secure the release of political prisoners and advance a democratic transition, adding that Venezuela could count on France's backing.Machado, responding after Trump's remarks, declared the moment 'the hour of freedom', saying Maduro's removal represented justice and the will of the Venezuelan people. She urged citizens to remain alert and organised as the country moves towards a transition.Former US vice president Kamala Harris struck a more cautious tone, emphasising the need to uphold democratic norms, protect civilians and ensure a credible political process. Her office said she continues to support international initiatives aimed at promoting stability and the rule of law in the region.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/trump-says-us-will-run-venezuela-after-maduro-capture-oil-troops-power-take-centre-stage-1767995","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1780124/donald-trump.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=1cbf4e8adef15452e7295e916d9ee304","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 06:25:33","author":"Andrea Trinidad","authors":["Andrea Trinidad"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.203},{"id":391100862,"title":"'Do Not Make America Safer, Stronger, or More Affordable,' Kamala Harris Hit Out at Trump Over Maduro's Capture","text":"Washington: Former US Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday slammed US President Donald Trump over the capture of former Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, saying the operation was driven by oil interests and not by concerns over drugs.In a post on X, Harris said Trump's actions in Venezuela would not make the United States safer and warned that forced regime change could destabilise the region, putting American lives at risk.\"Donald Trump's actions in Venezuela do not make America safer, stronger, or more affordable.

This is not about drugs or democracy. It is about oil and Donald Trump's desire to play the regional strongman. If he cared about either, he wouldn't pardon a convicted drug trafficker or sideline Venezuela's legitimate opposition while pursuing deals with Maduro's cronies,\" she added.Harris, who contested the recent presidential election against Trump, also warned that the operation could put US troops at risk and lacked any legal basis or exit plan.\"The President is putting troops at risk, spending billions, destabilising a region, and offering no legal authority, no exit plan, and no benefit at home. America needs leadership whose priorities are lowering costs for working families, enforcing the rule of law, strengthening alliances, and, most importantly, putting the American people first,\" she wrote.Soon after the US strike on Venezuela in the early hours of Saturday, President Donald Trump held a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence, where he announced that the United States would take control of Venezuela's vast oil reserves.Venezuela holds around 303 billion barrels of crude oil, accounting for nearly one-fifth of the world's proven oil reserves, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). CNN reported that these reserves are expected to play a major role in shaping the country's future.At the news conference, Trump said major American oil companies would be sent into Venezuela to rebuild the sector.\"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, and fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure,\" Trump said.Earlier in the day, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani also criticised the capture of Maduro and his wife, calling it an \"act of war\" and a violation of international law.In a post on X, Mamdani said, \"I was briefed this morning on the U.S. military capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, as well as their planned imprisonment in federal custody here in New York City. Unilaterally attacking a sovereign nation is an act of war and a violation of federal and international law.\"He warned that the move could have serious consequences for tens of thousands of Venezuelans living in New York City.According to US officials, former Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured in Caracas and flown out of the country in a joint operation involving intelligence agencies and US law enforcement.President Trump said the couple had been indicted in the Southern District of New York on charges of alleged \"drug trafficking and narco-terrorism conspiracies\" and would face trial in the United States.Trump said Maduro and his wife \"will soon face the full might of American justice and stand trial on American soil\" for their alleged role in drug trafficking. He added that they were being transported to New York, with authorities later deciding whether the trial would be held in New York or Florida.","summary":"Kamala Harris and New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani condemned the U.S. military&#39;s capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, with Harris asserting the action was driven by oil and Trump&#39;s political ambitions rather than democracy.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/do-not-make-america-safer-stronger-or-more-affordable-kamala-harris-hit-out-at-trump-over-maduro-s-capture","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/kamala-harris-taunts-donald-trump-plan-1767495284471-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 05:46:04","author":"Asian News International","authors":["Asian News International"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.425},{"id":391167482,"title":"વેનેઝુએલા પર ટ્રમ્પની કાર્યવાહીનો અમેરિકામાં જ વિરોધ, કમલા હેરિસે કહ્યું- બધુ ઓઈલ માટે થયું","text":"Kamala Harris Says Trump’s Action Is About Oil, Not Democracy : અમેરિકાના પૂર્વ વાઈસ પ્રેસિડેન્ટ કમલા હેરિસે વેનેઝુએલા પર કરાયેલી કાર્યવાહી અંગે પ્રમુખ ડોનાલ્ડ ટ્રમ્પની આકરી ટીકા કરી છે. તેમણે દાવો કર્યો છે કે આ ડ્રગ્સ કે લોકશાહી નહીં તેલ ( ક્રૂડ ઓઇલ )નો મામલો છે.\n\nટ્રમ્પ પર કમલા હેરિસને આકરા પ્રહાર \n\nઅમેરિકાએ વેનેઝુએલા પર હુમલો કરી વેનેઝુએલાના પ્રમુખ નિકોલસ માદુરો અને તેમની પત્નીને કેદ કર્યા છે. જેને લઈને દુનિયાના અનેક દેશો સવાલ ઉઠાવી રહ્યા છે. એવામાં કમલા હેરિસે કહ્યું છે, કે વેનેઝુલા પર ટ્રમ્પની કાર્યવાહીથી અમેરિકા ના તો અધિક સુરક્ષિત છે, ના મજબૂત બન્યું છે. માદુરો ક્રૂર અને ગેરકાયદે તાનાશાહ હતા, પણ આ કાર્યવાહી પણ ગેરકાયદે જ છે. સત્તા પરિવર્તન અને ઓઈલ માટે યુદ્ધ છેવટે તો અરાજકતામાં જ પરિણમશે. જેની કિંમત અમેરિકાના પરિવારોએ ચૂકવવી પડશે. \n\nટ્રમ્પને ડ્રગ્સ કે લોકશાહી નહીં, ઓઈલની ચિંતા: કમલા હેરિસ \n\nકમલા હેરિસે વધુમાં કહ્યું, કે અમેરિકાની જનતા ટ્રમ્પના જુઠ્ઠાણાથી કંટાળી ગઈ છે. આ ડ્રગ્સ કે લોકશાહીનો મામલો નથી. આ ઓઈલ અને ટ્રમ્પની તાકાતવર નેતા બનવાની ઈચ્છાનો મામલો છે. તેમને ડ્રગ્સ કે લોકશાહીની જ ચિંતા હોત તો ક્યારેય ડ્રગ્સ પેડલર્સને માફ ન કર્યા હોત. ટ્રમ્પ અમેરિકાના સૈનિકોને ખતરામાં નાંખી રહ્યા છે અને અબજો ડોલર ખર્ચો કરી રહ્યા છે. ટ્રમ્પ સમગ્ર ક્ષેત્રને અસ્થિર કરી રહ્યા છે. આ કાર્યવાહીથી દેશને કોઈ લાભ નથી. અમેરિકાને એવા નેતૃત્વની જરૂર છે જે અમેરિકાની જનતાને સર્વોપરી રાખે. અમેરિકાના પરિવારો માટે મોંઘવારી ઘટાડે. કાયદાનું શાસન લાગુ કરે.","summary":"Kamala Harris Says Trump’s Action Is About Oil, Not Democracy : અમેરિકાના પૂર્વ વાઈસ પ્રેસિડેન્ટ કમલા હેરિસે વેનેઝુએલા પર કરાયેલી કાર્યવાહી અંગે પ્રમુખ ડોનાલ્ડ ટ્રમ્પની આકરી ટીકા કરી છે. તેમણે દાવો કર્યો છે કે આ ડ્રગ્સ કે લોકશાહી નહીં તેલ ( ક્રૂડ ઓઇલ )નો મામલો છે.\n\nટ્રમ્પ પર કમલા હેરિસને આકરા પ્રહાર \n\nઅમેરિકાએ વેનેઝુએલા પર હુમલો કરી વેનેઝુએલાના પ્રમુખ નિકોલસ માદુરો અને તેમની પત્નીને કેદ કર્યા છે. જેને લઈને દુનિયાના અનેક દેશો સવાલ ઉઠાવી રહ્યા છે.","url":"https://www.gujaratsamachar.com/news/international/kamala-harris-slams-trump-over-venezuela-action-calls-it-an-oil-33434299089.html","image":"https://static.gujaratsamachar.com/articles/articles_thumbs/photo_1767505496693.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 05:44:56","author":"Gujarat Samachar","authors":["Gujarat Samachar"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.404},{"id":391102316,"title":"This is not about drugs or democracy, but...: Kamala Harris slams Trump","text":"Former US Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday slammed US President Donald Trump over the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, saying the operation was driven by oil interests and not by concerns over drugs.

We\"ve seen this movie before. Wars for regime change or oil that… — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 4, 2026 अमेरिका की कार्रवाई के बाद क्यों बढ़ी तेल की चर्चा? वेनेजुएला की राजधानी कराकस पर शनिवार को हुए हवाई हमलों के बाद अमेरिकी सेना द्वारा राष्ट्रपति निकोलस मादुरो को पकड़कर अमेरिका लाए जाने से दुनिया का ध्यान फिर से वेनेजुएला के तेल पर टिक गया है. इस ऑपरेशन के बाद अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप ने कहा कि अब वेनेजुएला को अमेरिका “चलाएगा”, जब तक कि वहां “सुरक्षित, सही और समझदारी भरा बदलाव” सुनिश्चित नहीं हो जाता. हालांकि ट्रंप ने यह साफ नहीं किया कि अमेरिका अब वेनेजुएला को किस तरह से और किस रूप में “चलाएगा”,लेकिन अमेरिका जिस तरह किसी संप्रभु देश पर हमला करके रातोंरात उसके राष्ट्रपति को जबरन उठाकर ले आया, उससे अंतरराष्ट्रीय समुदाय के सामने कुछ अहम नैतिक सवाल जरूर खड़े हो गए हैं. अमेरिकी रक्षा सचिव पीट हेगसेथ (US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth) ने CBS न्यूज़ से कहा कि निकोलस मादुरो को पकड़ने से अमेरिकियों को फ़ायदा होगा. उन्होंने इस हमले के बाद वेनेज़ुएला की दौलत और संसाधनों तक अमेरिका की पहुंच का ज़िक्र करते हुए कहा, \"हम यह पक्का कर सकते हैं कि हमें और ज़्यादा दौलत और संसाधन मिलें, जिससे अमेरिकी खून बहाए बिना उनका इस्तेमाल किया जा सके.\" वेनेजुएला के पास 17.3 खबर डॉलर का तेल यूएस एनर्जी इनफॉर्मेशन ए़डमिनिस्ट्रेशन के मुताबिक वेनेजुएला के पास दुनिया का सबसे बड़ा तेल भंडार है. अगर मौजूदा कीमत लगभग 57 डॉलर प्रति बैरल मानी जाए, तो उसके 303 अरब बैरल तेल की कुल कीमत करीब 17.3 ट्रिलियन डॉलर बैठती है. यह रकम अमेरिका और चीन को छोड़कर बाकी सभी देशों की साझा GDP से भी ज्यादा है. यानी इस तेल पर कब्जा रखने वाला देश सिर्फ एनर्जी मार्केट ही नहीं, बल्कि अंतरराष्ट्रीय राजनीति पर भी काफी असर डाल सकता है. इसी वजह से वेनेजुएला पर ट्रंप के हमले और उसके पास मौजूद तेल भंडार को आपस में जोड़कर देखा जा रहा है. यह ऑयल और मिनरल हथियाने की लड़ाई है? भारत के पूर्व विदेश राज्य मंत्री एमजे अकबर ने इस पूरे घटनाक्रम पर अपनी राय जाहिर करते हुए साफ-साफ कहा, “मेरी नजर में इस हमले की वजह लोकतंत्र या डेवलपमेंट से नहीं जुड़ी है. यह मिनरल्स और ऑयल से जुड़ा मामला है. कई बार लोग यह नहीं समझते कि वेनेजुएला के पास दुनिया का सबसे बड़ा तेल भंडार है. ट्रंप प्रशासन और राष्ट्रपति ट्रंप वेनेजुएला पर कंट्रोल करना चाहते हैं.” वेनेजुएला की सरकार ने भी आरोप लगाया है कि अमेरिकी हमले का मकसद देश के तेल और खनिज संसाधनों पर कब्जा करना है. इस सोच को और मजबूती तब मिली जब हमले के बाद ट्रंप ने फॉक्स न्यूज को दिए इंटरव्यू में कहा कि अमेरिका वेनेजुएला की ऑयल इंडस्ट्री में “बहुत मजबूती से शामिल” रहेगा. अमेरिका के लिए वेनेजुएला का तेल इतना जरूरी क्यों? रणनीतिक तौर पर वेनेजुएला का क्रूड ऑयल अमेरिका के लिए काफी अहम है. अमेरिका में निकलने वाला ज्यादातर क्रूड ऑयल तेल हल्का होता है, जो पेट्रोल के लिए बेहतर है, लेकिन डीजल, एस्फॉल्ट (asphalt) और हैवी इंडस्ट्रियल फ्यूल के तौर पर उतना उपयोगी नहीं है. वेनेजुएला का क्रूड ऑयल भारी (heavy crude) होता है, जो इस गैप को भरने में कारगर है. अमेरिका की कई रिफाइनरीज़ भी खास तौर पर इसी तेल को रिफाइन करने के लिए डिजाइन की गई हैं. सीनियर मार्केट एनालिस्ट फिल फ्लिन ने CNN से कहा कि, “अमेरिका की कई रिफाइनरीज़ वेनेजुएला के क्रूड ऑयल को ध्यान में रखकर बनाई गई हैं और उसे प्रॉसेस करने का काम ज्यादा बेहतर तरीके से करती हैं.” क्या तेल के गणित में फंस गए मादुरो ? फिल फ्लिन का मानना है कि अगर हालात इसी तरह आगे बढ़ते हैं और अमेरिकी कंपनियों को वेनेजुएला की ऑयल इंडस्ट्री में बड़ी भूमिका निभाने का मौका मिलता है, तो इसका असर पूरी दुनिया के तेल बाजार पर पड़ सकता है. उनका कहना है कि “अगर यह प्रॉसेस ऐसे ही आगे बढ़ती रही और अमेरिकी कंपनियों को वेनेजुएला में अपने पांव जमाने की छूट मिल गई, तो यह अंतरराष्ट्रीय तेल बाजार के लिए गेम-चेंजर साबित हो सकता है.” वहीं UBS के स्ट्रैटजिस्ट जियोवानी स्टाउनोवो (Giovanni Staunovo) का कहना है, “अभी असर का पूरा आकलन करना जल्दबाजी होगी, लेकिन अमेरिका द्वारा तेल टैंकरों को रोकने के बाद से वेनेजुएला का ऑयल प्रोडक्शन और एक्सपोर्ट लगातार गिरता रहा है.” इंटरनेशनल ऑयल मार्केट का बड़ा खिलाड़ी रहा है वेनेजुएला 1970 के दशक में वेनेजुएला का तेल उत्पादन करीब 35 लाख बैरल प्रतिदिन तक पहुंच गया था, जो उस समय अंतरराष्ट्रीय उत्पादन का 7 प्रतिशत से ज्यादा था. लेकिन राष्ट्रपति मादुरो के शासन में हालात तेजी से बदले. पिछले साल वेनेजुएला का उत्पादन घटकर करीब 11 लाख बैरल प्रतिदिन रह गया, जो अंतरराष्ट्रीय सप्लाई का एक प्रतिशत से भी कम है. मादुरो के 2013 में सत्ता संभालने के समय मौजूद उत्पादन की तुलना में भी यह आधे से कम है. उत्पादन में इस गिरावट की बड़ी वजह वेनेजुएला के तेल पर अमेरिकी पाबंदी रही है. इसके अलावा निवेश की कमी, खराब मैनेजमेंट, बुनियादी ढांचे की बदहाली और भ्रष्टाचार जैसे आरोप भी लगते रहे हैं. इन हालात में वेनेजुएला की रिफाइनरीज की हालत खस्ता हो गई. अंतरराष्ट्रीय बाजार पर बड़ा असर क्यों नहीं वेनेजुएला पर अमेरिकी हमले के बाद अंतरराष्ट्रीय तेल बाजार में ज्यादा घबराहट नहीं दिखी. वजह साफ है. मौजूदा स्थिति में वेनेजुएला इतना तेल पैदा ही नहीं करता कि उसकी सप्लाई रुकने से कीमतों में बड़ा उछाल आ जाए. यही कारण है कि अमेरिकी हमले जैसी बड़ी घटना के बावजूद बाजार तुलनात्मक रूप से शांत बना हुआ है. \"","url":"https://hindi.financialexpress.com/international-news/trump-venezuela-oil-attack-explained-17-trillion-dollar-reserves-10970145","image":"https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/filters:format(webp)/financial-express-hindi/media/media_files/2026/01/04/nicolas-maduro-in-us-custody-trump-truth-social-2026-01-04-11-17-07.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 05:30:45","author":"Fe Hindi Desk","authors":["Fe Hindi Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.536},{"id":391104674,"title":"Kamala Harris Slams Maduro Capture, Says US Action Driven by Oil Interests","text":"Washington, DC: Former US Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday criticised President Donald Trump over the capture of former Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, alleging that the operation was driven by oil interests rather than concerns over drugs.

It is worth remembering that despite everything we feel and read, things are not as bad as they could be, and in many ways they are a whole lot better than ever before, considering the very low base at which humankind started.\n\nThe data show we are still enjoying progress, despite the many apparent setbacks. It may not feel like it at many levels, but the graph is up, low points, wars and gross inequality notwithstanding. It is just a matter of scale. Century-on-century, we have been decreasing infant mortality and increasing life expectancy and our ability to treat diseases. Our understanding of the planet and even parts of the universe would have been unimaginable just some decades ago.\n\nPerhaps what confuses us is the very complexity of the modern world, which makes us second-guess ourselves. The certainties we came to rely upon during the last 75 years are being swept away. We can no longer predict the consequence of what might have been a routine event, because the unwritten rules are changing and we are caught in a slipstream. Instead, we have to try to understand hard-to-fathom facts.\n\nMaybe we should begin embracing the discomfort and see where it leads us.\n\nYou might ask how on earth did a 34-year old Muslim, born in Uganda, from the far left of the US Democratic Party, just take over as mayor of the most dynamic city in the US and possibly the world, New York. And to do it while the most reactionary, ultra-conservative federal government is in power, under a New Yorker who thinks he owns the place, is almost unbelievable.\n\nZohran Mamdani’s victory follows closely enough on the heels of Kamala Harris’s decisive loss in the 2024 presidential election, which returned a previous Republican president to the White House, to prompt us to question what might have made Mamdani and his politics so much more attractive to the voting public.\n\nThere are many reasons, but one I would like to consider is that Mamdani is a maverick. In many ways Mamdani is like Trump, but of another ilk. That people voted for Donald Trump tells us that they desired radical change: ditto in Mamdani’s case.\n\nMavericks are those who dare to break with the norm and stake a claim on what others do not. Sam Maverick was a Texan farmer who decided not to brand his cattle stock like all other farmers did; therefore all unbranded calves were thought to be his and he happily claimed them, getting richer faster. He was unorthodox, but he proved the point that by seeing things differently, thinking out of the box and going against the grain, you can win and bring about change.\n\nEvery manager knows that a good team needs a maverick to be truly top notch. The difficulty comes in managing that element, which is by definition disruptive, challenging and often iconoclastic, while attempting to keep cohesiveness and constancy as key factors in team success. Why would you not want someone on your team who asks why we are doing things in a certain way, or why a rule exists?\n\nIt is my experience that those in authority shrink away from individuals who challenge us to think more deeply instead of relaxing into groupthink. As people become more senior they become more risk-averse, in general, and business, creativity and even political parties suffer as a result.\n\nSenior Democrats were very slow and some even refused to endorse Mamdani, but his success should reveal to them something about why they lost the presidential election. They lost because they did not dare.\n\nIn 2025, TT voted in a new government because we wanted a break from a form of national politics that we came to disapprove of. Around the world, voters are toying with different ideas of how to conduct politics and governance.\n\nSome say it is because capitalism is broken. I tend to lean in that direction. Democracy and capitalism are not twins, but, as the saying goes, every society is just three meals away from chaos. I wonder, therefore, how world leaders will address the massive problem of flawed capitalism and ailing democracy.\n\nIn TT, our democracy is well enough, but we face serious economic and social challenges and we must innovate to succeed. We will not all agree with every new departure from the status quo, and vested interests will complain, but we voted for change, so we cannot now shy away from it. Since our PM is displaying maverick tendencies, in 2026 our big job is to manage the new situation by holding the PM and her government to account so that we all benefit from the newfound unorthodoxy.","summary":"As we enter this new year of 2026, it might be a good idea to start practising positive thinking.

Both are expected to be held in federal custody and face criminal charges linked to a long-standing U.S. Justice Department indictment accusing them of involvement in a narco-terrorism conspiracy.According to the latest reports Maduro was in a New York jail.A Reuters report said the operation, named Operation Absolute Resolve, had been planned and rehearsed for months. Once launched, it was completed in under 30 minutes. US forces carried out air raids on multiple targets in and around Venezuela’s capital Caracas before detaining Maduro and his wife and flying them out of the country. At least 40 people were killed during the airstrikes in Caracas, a Venezuelan official told The New York Times, according to Reuters.Speaking after the capture, U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States would run Venezuela “at least temporarily” until a transition could be put in place. “We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition,” Trump said at a press conference, adding that Washington would tap Venezuela’s vast oil reserves and sell “large amounts” to other countries, reported AP..Maria Corina Machado, the US‑backed opposition leader and last year’s Nobel Peace Prize recipient, posted on social media that “the hour of freedom has arrived” and called for the opposition’s 2024 election candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, to “immediately” assume the presidency.But Trump was notably cool about expectations that Machado could become Venezuela’s new leader, saying she did not have “support or respect” inside the country. Instead, Trump publicly praised Vice President Delcy Rodríguez , appointed acting president by Venezuela’s Supreme Court saying “she’s essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,” reported AP.The court had said it would debate the legal framework required to guarantee the continuity of the state, governance and national defence in light of the “forced absence” of the president, reported Reuters.The US military action has triggered widespread international reaction. The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to meet on Monday at the request of Colombia, backed by Russia and China, to discuss the situation. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has expressed concern that the U.S. move sets a “dangerous precedent”, according to AFP. The Security Council had already met twice in recent months over escalating tensions between Washington and Caracas, Reuters said.Protests were reported both inside and outside the United States following the operation. NBC News reported that demonstrators holding placards reading “No war on Venezuela” gathered outside the Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, New York, where Maduro’s aircraft landed.In Washington, the developments have sparked sharp political debate. AP reported that House Democrats are set to hold an emergency caucus meeting to discuss the implications of the operation. Kamala Harris criticised the move, saying it did not make the United States safer or stronger and warning that regime-change wars often end in chaos. In a post on X, she accused the Trump administration of acting without clear legal authority or an exit plan, Reuters reported..Senior US officials, meanwhile, have defended the operation. Secretary of State Marco Rubio hinted that further action could follow elsewhere in the region, saying Cuban officials would have “reason to be concerned” after Maduro’s capture, according to AFP.Legal experts cited by Reuters said the case against Maduro is likely to raise complex constitutional and international law questions, given that a sitting foreign head of state has been seized and transferred to US custody. Top criminal defence lawyers are already seeking to represent Maduro in what is expected to be a high-stakes trial in Manhattan federal court, reported AP.The U.S. Embassy has reiterated its Level 4 “Do Not Travel” advisory for Venezuela, warning that the security situation remains fluid and that no commercial flights are operating in or out of the country.

France is fully mobilized and vigilant, including to ensure the safety of its nationals during these uncertain times,” he wrote on X.\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Britain has long supported a transition of power in Venezuela and regarded Nicolás Maduro as an illegitimate president.\nIn a post on X, Starmer said the UK “shed no tears” over the end of Maduro’s regime, while reiterating his support for international law. “The UK government will discuss the evolving situation with US counterparts in the days ahead as we seek a safe and peaceful transition to a legitimate government that reflects the will of the Venezuelan people,” he said.\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said Italy has closely followed developments in Venezuela and has never recognised Nicolás Maduro’s self-proclaimed electoral victory.\nIn a post on X, Meloni said Italy, along with key international partners, had condemned the regime’s acts of repression and consistently supported the Venezuelan people’s aspiration for a democratic transition. She added that while the Italian government does not view external military action as the appropriate means to end totalitarian regimes, it considers defensive intervention legitimate in cases involving hybrid threats to national security, including those linked to narcotrafficking.\n“We continue to follow with particular attention the situation of the Italian community in Venezuela, whose security constitutes the Government’s absolute priority,” she added.\nMaduro and First Lady Cilia Flores were captured in a surprise nighttime operation carried out by US forces after being pulled from their bedroom, according to a report in CNN. The couple was reportedly asleep in their home within the heavily guarded Fort Tiuna military complex in Caracas when American commandos entered the residence.\nThe operation was reportedly carried out by the US Army’s Delta Force with support from the FBI and was completed in under 30 minutes. US officials said no American personnel were killed in the raid.","summary":"Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores were captured in a surprise nighttime operation carried out by US forces after being pulled from their bedroom.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/act-of-war-kamala-harris-mamdani-criticise-us-airstrikes-on-venezuela-calls-it-unlawful-ws-l-9808341.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2026/01/Untitled-design-2026-01-04T080936.221-2026-01-18079f25a862c3e765b8a3f2b7ac252a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 02:52:01","author":"Aanchal Sinha,News18","authors":["Aanchal Sinha","News18"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.231},{"id":391083718,"title":"Ex-VP Harris rejects Trump’s Venezuela intervention","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris condemned the Trump administration’s military operation in Venezuela early Sunday, characterising the capture of Nicolás Maduro as a reckless escalation that prioritises “oil and ego” over American security.\n\nIn a statement posted to X, Harris warned that the overnight strikes and subsequent extraction of the Venezuelan leader represent an unlawful return to a failed era of regime-change conflicts.\n\n“The brutal nature of the Maduro regime does not grant the executive branch a ‘blank check’ to bypass legal norms or ignore the sovereignty of international law,” Harris argued.\n\nShe asserted that the administration’s actions were both unlawful and unwise, drawing direct parallels to past foreign policy disasters.\n\nAccording to Harris, these wars for regime change or oil are frequently sold to the public as displays of national strength but “inevitably devolve into chaos, leaving American families to pay the ultimate price.”\n\nThe statement specifically challenged the White House’s justification for the mission, which officials have framed as a targeted strike against a narco-terrorist network.\n\nHarris rejected this narrative, claiming the American people are “tired of being lied to” and that the operation is not about drugs or democracy.\n\nInstead, she alleged the intervention is driven by oil interests and a desire by President Trump to “play the role of a regional strongman.”\n\nHarris further pointed to perceived inconsistencies in the administration’s strategy, noting that the President has sidelined Venezuela’s legitimate democratic opposition while reportedly pursuing deals with Maduro’s former associates.\n\n“How can this administration claim to care about the rule of law while simultaneously pardoning convicted drug traffickers at home and ignoring the democratic voices of the Venezuelan people?” Harris questioned.\n\nThe former Vice President concluded by highlighting the domestic and human costs of the operation, noting that the President is putting U.S. troops at risk and “spending billions of dollars without a clear exit plan or legal authority.”\n\nHarris called for a shift in leadership priorities, urging a focus on lowering costs for working families and strengthening global alliances rather than pursuing destabilising military interventions that “offer no tangible benefit to the American people.”\n\nBy framing the intervention as “a movie we’ve seen before,” Harris is tapping into public fatigue with long-term foreign conflicts.\n\nHer critique specifically highlights a perceived contradiction: that the administration is sidelining the “legitimate opposition” in Venezuela while simultaneously claiming to fight for democracy.","summary":"Former VP Harris condemns Trump&#8217;s Venezuela intervention, calling it an unlawful escalation driven by &#8216;oil and ego&#8217; over American security.\n\nRead More: https://punchng.com/ex-vp-harris-rejects-trumps-venezuela-intervention/","url":"https://punchng.com/ex-vp-harris-rejects-trumps-venezuela-intervention/","image":"https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10085131/AFP__20251009__2240162005__v2__MidRes__FinlandSPresidentAndPrimeMinisterMeetWithTrum-1024x630.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 02:30:30","author":"Jide Ajia,Punch Newspapers","authors":["Jide Ajia","Punch Newspapers"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":391076054,"title":"Partyism Without The Party","text":"Zohran Mamdani’s victory was rooted in organizations that took up the b a s e – b u i l d i n g and mobilization functions that once fell to parties.\n\nCHRIS MAISANO\n\nWhen was the last time being on the left was fun? Even in the best of times, supporting socialism in America can feel like performing a grim duty in the face of almost certain disappointment. The chapter titles in Burnout, Hannah Proctor’s investigation of the emotional landscapes of leftist militancy, are revealing: Melancholia, Nostalgia, Depression, Burnout, Exhaustion, Bitterness, Trauma, Mourning. One of the many virtues of Zohran Mamdani’s remarkable campaign for New York City mayor was that it never felt this way, not even when he was sitting near the bottom of the polls. It was a year-long act of collective joy. Real joy—not the brief sugar high that surged when Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden at the top of the Democrats’ 2024 ticket. Volunteering for Mamdani never felt like a chore, even when the weather was bad and fewer canvassers showed up for their shift than expected. It was a blast from start to finish, and we didn’t even have to console ourselves with a moral victory. This time, we actually won.\n\n We tend to speak of voting as a civic duty, and of boosting voter participation as a high-minded, “good government” concern. The nature of mass politics, however, has often been anything but staid and responsible. Michael McGerr begins his book The Decline of Popular Politics with a colorful account of a Democratic Party “flag raising” in New Haven in 1876. It was a raucous affair, complete with torchlight parades, street corner speeches, brass bands, fireworks, and rivers of booze courtesy of local party notables. Political spectacle hasn’t gone away, but since the advent of modern communications technology it has become enormously mediated. By contrast, historian Richard Bensel has described the “sheer physicality of voting” and party politics in the nineteenth century. People flocked to the polls, Bensel writes, “simply because they were exciting, richly endowed with ethno-cultural themes of identity, manhood, and mutual recognition of community standing.” It was party politics, in both senses of the word.\n\nThis era should not be romanticized. Aside from the fact that only men could vote, the atmosphere of drink-soddened masculinity that pervaded election campaigns kept most women away even when it did not descend into partisan and racial violence. Even so, it is hard not to agree with political scientists Daniel Schlozman and Sam Rosenfeld that America’s early mass parties “bequeathed a genuinely popular and participatory” culture whose “promise still haunts American politics.”\n\n Much has been made of Mamdani’s extremely effective use of social media, short-form video, and other digital formats that speak to the younger and disengaged voters many other campaigns struggle to reach. There’s no doubt this was a major ingredient in the campaign’s success; historically high rates of participation among Gen Z and newly registered voters testify to its effectiveness. But the sheer physicality of the Mamdani campaign, and the ways it used digital media to bring people together offline, has been underrated.\n\nConsider the citywide scavenger hunt in August. A call went out over social media on a Saturday night, and thousands of people showed up the next morning to race around seven stops across the boroughs, each one connected to the city’s history. Disgraced incumbent mayor Eric Adams denounced the frivolity: “I’m sure a scavenger hunt was fun for the people with nothing better to do. . . . Mamdani is trying to turn our city into the Squid Games.” One competitor offered a different perspective: “I think actually trying to have fun in politics and do a little bit of a community building exercise, a way to actually learn about our city—I’ve never known another politician to do it.”\n\nThe scavenger hunt was just one example of the campaign’s popular and participatory culture. So much of the campaign was in public and in person: mass rallies, a walk through the entire length of Manhattan, unannounced appearances at clubs and concerts, a 100,000-strong army of volunteers who braved countless walk-ups to knock over 1 million doors. From early spring through November’s general election, the campaign assumed the scale and spirit of a social movement, or a Knicks playoff run. There was a palpable buzz around the city—not just in what New York electoral data maven Michael Lange termed the “Commie Corridor” neighborhoods, populated by young college-educated leftists, but in Little Pakistan, Little Bangladesh, Parkchester, and other places where nary a New Yorker tote bag can be found.\n\n When the polls closed, more than 2 million voters had cast their ballots, the highest turnout in a New York City mayoral election since 1969. More than 1 million voters, just over half the electorate, voted for Mamdani. At the same time, over 850,000 voted for Andrew Cuomo, who successfully consolidated many Republican voters behind his second-effort bid to return to public office. Another 146,000 voted for the official Republican candidate, the perennial also-ran Curtis Sliwa.\n\nMamdani’s shockingly decisive win in the Democratic primary had been powered by his core constituencies: younger voters, college-educated renters, and South Asian and Muslim voters, many of whom participated in the electoral process for the first time. He carried these constituencies with him into the general election, but he may have struggled to win the final contest without rallying large numbers of working-class Black and Hispanic voters too. As Lange has shown, the areas that shifted most strongly toward Mamdani from the primary to the general election were Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens. Many Black and Hispanic voters under forty-five were already in Mamdani’s column in the primary, but his numbers then were far lower among their parents and grandparents. After securing the Democratic nomination, his campaign made inroads by building relationships with Black church congregations and community organizations, as well as labor unions with disproportionately Black and Hispanic memberships. By cobbling these disparate constituencies together in the general election, Lange concluded, Mamdani successfully renewed the promise of the Rainbow Coalition for the twenty-first century.\n\n Not By Bread-and-Butter Alone Explaining how Mamdani did this has become something of a Rorschach test for pundits. Much of the commentary has focused on his campaign’s affordability agenda, which targeted the city’s cost-of-living crisis through proposals for freezing rents, eliminating fares on city buses, and implementing universal child care, among others. While Mamdani’s emphasis on affordability was necessary for securing the victory, and his economic proposals were popular across his constituencies, he would not have been able to mobilize the coalition he did on the strength of bread-and-butter appeals alone. Mamdani’s unequivocal stances on “non-economic” questions like the genocide in Gaza or the ICE raids terrorizing immigrant communities built trust among precisely the people he needed to join his volunteer army or turn out to vote for the first time.\n\nSupport for Palestine dovetailed with Mamdani’s vocal opposition to the Trump administration’s assault on immigrants, which came together in an impromptu confrontation with Trump’s “border czar” Tom Homan last March. A video of the encounter, in which Mamdani challenged Homan over the illegal detention of Palestinian solidarity activist Mahmoud Khalil, circulated widely on social media and in immigrant communities. All of this helped Mamdani link his economic program with opposition to the president’s authoritarian lurch. In doing so, he appealed to immigrant voters worried about both ICE raids and making the rent, as well as voters who want their representatives to stand up to masked federal agents snatching people off the streets and whisking them away in unmarked cars. Moreover, Mamdani’s identity as a Muslim of South Asian descent undoubtedly activated demobilized voters excited by the idea of seeing someone like them in Gracie Mansion. The historic turnout surge that swept Muslim and South Asian neighborhoods in the outer boroughs is inseparable from Mamdani’s faith, his cultural fluency, and his outspoken defense of fellow Muslims against the Cuomo campaign’s Islamophobic bigotry.\n\nThe New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (NYC-DSA) has received a lot of credit for Mamdani’s victory, and rightfully so. Mamdani is a DSA member, as are his chief of staff, field director, and other key advisers. The campaign’s field leads, who organized canvassing shifts, were disproportionately members (I coled a weekly canvass in my Brooklyn neighborhood during the primary). But organizations rooted in South Asian and Muslim communities deserve their fair share of the credit, including Desis Rising Up and Moving (DRUM) Beats, the Muslim Democratic Club of New York, Bangladeshi Americans for Political Progress, and grassroots affinity groups like Pakistanis for Zohran and Bangladeshis for Zohran. The mobilization of these communities transformed the electorate and helped Mamdani offset Cuomo’s strength in neighborhoods that shifted sharply to the former governor in the general election.\n\nThere are nearly 1 million Muslims in New York, but until Mamdani’s campaign they were a sleeping giant in local politics. Roughly 350,000 Muslims were registered, but only 12 percent of registered Muslims turned out to vote in the 2021 mayoral election. Mamdani’s campaign turned this dynamic completely on its head. DRUM Beats, which has organizing bases in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens spanning a range of South Asian and Indo-Caribbean diasporic communities, played a key role. Their organizers are committed and tenacious, and many of them are women. “We’re like a gang,” the group’s organizing director Kazi Fouzia told a Politico reporter last summer. “When we go to any shop, people just move aside and say, ‘Oh my god. The DRUM leaders are here. The DRUM women are here.’” When Mamdani recognized “every New Yorker in Kensington and Midwood” in his victory speech, he had in mind the scores of aunties who ran themselves ragged knocking doors, sending texts, and making phone calls.\n\nIn their post-election analysis of the voting data, DRUM Beats detailed an enormous increase in turnout in the communities they organize. Based on Board of Elections data and their own models, they estimated that from 2021 to 2025 South Asian turnout exploded from 15.3 percent to nearly 43 percent, while Muslim turnout went from barely 15 percent to over 34 percent. While representing just 7 percent of New York’s registered voters, they accounted for an estimated 15 percent of actual voters in the general election. Nearly half of the city’s registered Bangladeshi and Pakistani American voters participated in the election, outpacing the overall participation rate of roughly 42 percent. This historic development didn’t materialize out of thin air. Mamdani’s faith, identity, and raw talent certainly didn’t hurt, but people on the ground have been quietly building civic infrastructure in these neighborhoods. In his assessment of the South Asian surge, electoral strategist Waleed Shahid noted that the places with the biggest gains were precisely “the places where DRUM Beats and allied organizers have spent years knocking doors, translating ballot measures, convening tenant meetings in basement prayer rooms, and building lists through WhatsApp groups and WhatsApp rumors alike.” I had the good fortune of getting to know some of these organizers during the campaign. Their capacity to mobilize working-class immigrants who had been overlooked for too long is formidable, and Mamdani’s victory cannot be explained without it.\n\nContinues in DISSENT (https://dissentmagazine.org), November 25, 2025.","summary":"Zohran Mamdani’s victory was rooted in organizations that took up the b a s e &#8211; b u i l d i n g and mobilization functions that once fell&#8230;\n\n\nThe post Partyism Without The Party appeared first on Independent Newspaper Nigeria.","url":"https://independent.ng/partyism-without-the-party/","image":"https://independent.ng//wp-content/uploads/1-452.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 00:39:53","author":"Our Correspondents","authors":["Our Correspondents"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.315},{"id":391074948,"title":"TANYA GOLD: I wish celebs like Lineker would follow Queen Claire's lead and JUST SHUT UP","text":"In this month's Harper's Bazaar, the Queen told all 'activist' actors bent on sharing their armchair political opinions with the world to 'shut up'. Of course, these unregal words weren't Queen Camilla's, but came from the mouth of Claire Foy, the actress who played a young Elizabeth II in The Crown. And it was glorious to hear an entertainer honouring their trade above all else.\n\n'What I believe and who I am and where I stand on things is constantly in flux,' she said, 'as much as it is for everyone else, and I have absolutely no authority to discuss or proclaim about anything other than what I do as an actor. If you're just making noise for the sake of it, then you should probably shut up - so I tend to shut up.'\n\nThis brings me to Gary Lineker, who is an expert in whinnying, so much so that sometimes I feel I know him better than he knows himself.\n\nIn an interview with The London Standard last month, he insisted that in his 30 years working for the BBC 'I didn't ever give my political views; never, ever said who I vote for, ever, because I know where the boundaries are'.\n\nI think we know perfectly well where his political sympathies lie. Let's not forget that this is the man who last year reposted to Instagram a video on Zionism adorned with an image of a cartoon rat.\n\nHis subsequent apology couldn't calm the storm that ultimately ended in his defenestration from the BBC.\n\nBut it seems that promoting an image, which is long code for the infection antisemites think Jews are, no longer precludes a man from sharing his moronic moral philosophy as widely as possible.\n\nCollecting a presenter of the year trophy at the National TV Awards last year, he suggested he would continue to speak up for the voiceless, though what exactly he has done for the voiceless - excepting footballers, who we expect to be voiceless - is unclear.\n\nAnd get used to hearing more of Gary's man-of-the-people (just-richer) schtick, as this is a World Cup year, and he has a football deal with Netflix to push. It's not just Lineker, of course, who will continue to show us the way of righteousness in 2026, whether we ask for it or not.\n\nToo many entertainers wade in serious ponds nowadays and, with their very presence, make them unserious - as if politics and suffering are just arms of the entertainment industry, to be treated as such. With unseriousness.\n\nIt's part of the decadence - the lack of expertise and humility, the self-aggrandisement - of the age, but Lineker has more in common with Donald Trump than either would like to admit. Both are showmen with dreams of more.\n\nIf Lineker knew anything about anti-Semitism - or immigration, or social mobility, or the philosopher Kierkegaard - it would be a fine thing to hear him on it.\n\nBut his interest looks like a continuation not of his knowledge, which is negligible, but his vanity, which is ferocious.\n\nIt is no longer enough, it seems, to be known for what you are good at: in his case, chatting about football. You must be sanctified while doing it. It's almost as if he was never loved enough.\n\nLong gone are the days when a reporter asked Elvis Presley about anti-Vietnam protests and he replied: 'Honey, I just seem to keep my own personal views about that to myself because I'm just an entertainer.'\n\nIt used to be that only obvious loons - Roger Waters of Pink Floyd (Palestine), John Lennon of The Beatles (non-specified peace), Marlon Brando (native Americans) - fell to performative activism to make themselves feel more interesting or serious. Now almost everyone does it or, to quote Sacha Baron Cohen as his satirical creation Bruno, 'Clooney's got Darfur, Sting's got the Amazon and Bono's got AIDS!'\n\nMost large charities have celebrity liaison officers now, possibly because they think people are too insensible to care about something unless a big face they have seen on TV, film or at a concert is attached to it. The results are gruesome.\n\nI have still not got over the spectacle of Angelina Jolie (Maleficent) and William Hague, (then foreign secretary) trying to end rape in war and that was in 2014. They didn't end rape in war, but you know that.\n\nLast week, Jolie appeared at the Rafah crossing to Gaza to fail to bring peace to the Middle East.\n\nAfter #MeToo, celebrities co-opted activists and would appear with them on red carpets, like in-laws who had never met before and who, given the choice, never would again. We have Cynthia Nixon of Sex And The City (Palestine and Trans rights), Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson of Harry Potter (Trans rights) and John Cleese of Monty Python (Palestine): they tend to cleave to fashionable causes.\n\nCelebrity activism is so obviously an instrument of vanity - an emotional, rather than political imperative, more to do with the activist than the cause.\n\nThis was amply demonstrated by the celebrities who went all out for Kamala Harris in the 2024 American presidential campaign. She was endorsed by Taylor Swift, Beyonce, Oprah Winfrey and Bruce Springsteen. Harris still lost, and pollsters said the endorsements actively harmed her.\n\nIn Ohio, 24 per cent of voters said Swift's support made them like Harris less.\n\nThat's not good news for the aggrieved the celebrities claim to speak for, but perhaps they are too rich to care.","summary":"TANYA GOLD: In an interview with The London Standard last month, he said in his 30 years working for the BBC he never gave his political views.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-15432129/TANYA-GOLD-celebs-Lineker-Queen-Claire.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/04/00/105210337-0-image-a-71_1767486094574.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 00:28:28","author":"Editor,Tanya Gold","authors":["Editor","Tanya Gold"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.156},{"id":391073410,"title":"This past year was pretty great. Here’s a wish list for 2026","text":"Listening to the usual legacy media suspects, one might think 2025 was an apocalyptic wasteland of sorts – an authoritarian fever dream brought on by the return of Donald J. Trump to the Oval Office. The reality looked very different. This past year was, in many ways, a pretty great and clarifying one. Let’s take stock of what happened when our government remembered whom it serves, as well as what unfinished business remains as we flip the calendar.\n\nFirst, the obvious: Political sanity was restored to the nation’s capital. After years of leftist elite-driven chaos – wide-open borders, hyper-vindictive lawfare, fecklessness on the world stage, and more – the nation has begun to revert back to first principles: National sovereignty, law and order, and strong leadership abroad. Under Trump, the United States has once again acted like a real nation-state that pursues its real interests, not a nongovernmental organization with a nagging guilt complex.\n\nThat reorientation has paid huge dividends. On immigration, the Biden-era invasion at the southern border has tapered by more than 90%. On energy, a renewed embrace of domestic production has led to the lowest average national gas prices in nearly five years. Violent crime, thanks to Trump’s law enforcement operations and innovative use of the National Guard, has dramatically fallen: Murders decreased by nearly 20% from 2024, and robbery and burglary also saw double-digit percentage decreases. Abroad, allies and adversaries alike recalibrated to the reality that the White House once again means what it says.\n\nStill, work always remains. Here, then, is my 2026 wish list.\n\n1. Peace in Eastern Europe. The Russia-Ukraine war has gone on far, far too long. The Trump administration has exerted tremendous diplomatic effort trying to orchestrate a peace deal, which thus far remains elusive. A durable peace – one that halts the senseless slaughter on both sides, respects Ukrainian sovereignty and accommodates legitimate Russian concerns, and avoids a wider great-power conflagration – should be a paramount Trump administration foreign policy goal in 2026. Russia is the invader, and Vladimir Putin is the greater obstacle to a lasting peace, but both sides need to make painful – if, frustratingly, also painfully obvious – concessions.\n\n2. Victory on Birthright Citizenship. Back home, a consequential legal battle now sits before the U.S. Supreme Court: the Trump administration’s righteous challenge to the erroneous practice of constitutionally “required” birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children of illegal aliens. The notion that the 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, was meant to constitutionalize a global human trafficking magnet – granting automatic citizenship to all children born here, including those whose parents entered the country illegally – is indefensible as a matter of plain constitutional text, the congressional history in the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and basic common sense. Indeed, birthright citizenship has been nothing short of ruinous for the United States. A Trump administration victory would restore Congress’s rightful authority over circumscribing citizenship and remove a longstanding incentive for illegal immigration.\n\n3. Improved Affordability and Housing Costs. Legal victories mean relatively little if ordinary Americans continue to feel like they are getting squeezed. Improved affordability must be front and center in 2026 – from the federal level down to states and localities. The cost of living is not an economic abstraction; it affects rent, groceries, child care and the difficulty of buying a first home. Housing, in particular, demands attention. Housing policy should reward supply, not suffocate it – cutting red tape and burdensome construction fees, reforming zoning incentives, and curtailing the inflationary spending that puts upward pressure on mortgage rates. A nation where young families cannot afford to put down roots is a nation courting decline – the very antithesis of Trumpian restoration.\n\n4. Justice for Minnesota Somali Fraud Scandal. The burgeoning massive fraud scandal over state and federal funds for child care in Minnesota, involving many businesses run by Somali immigrants, has become a test case for whether the rule of law still applies when politics get uncomfortable. Justice means following the facts wherever they lead: recovering stolen taxpayer dollars and holding wrongdoers and abettors legally accountable without fear or favor. To wit, on the subject of abettors: What did Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), Atty. Gen. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and other prominent Minnesota politicians know, and when did they know it? Moreover, what did Kamala Harris – who picked Walz as her 2024 presidential running mate – know, and when did she know it? The American people deserve answers to all these questions.\n\n5. Tamed Communist China. Finally, no wish list can be complete without confronting the central geopolitical challenge of our age: that of Communist China. Simply put, Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party, who just presided over their largest live-fire military exercises around Taiwan, must be meaningfully deterred in the Indo-Pacific. That means maintaining a combative tariff posture, implementing as much economic decoupling as is feasible, and emboldening key regional allies – such as Japan – who share America’s interest in freedom of maritime navigation and diminished Chinese hegemony. Decades from now, Trump’s presidential legacy will be partially defined by how he handled the China challenge. Now is not the time to take the foot off the gas pedal.\n\nThis past year showed what is possible when Washington rejects the politics of managed decline and reembraces the best of the American tradition and way of life.

Removing Them Is Not.","text":"It only took two decades from electing its first socialist leaders to reach those catastrophic economic realities because, despite what the Left will tell us — that \"real socialism\" has never been tried — the truth is this: \"real socialism\" has been tried. Multiple times. And it always, invariably, fails.\n\nOr as Garry Kasparov said, \"Venezuela isn't what happens when socialism fails, it's what happens when socialism succeeds. Thuggery and poverty.\"\n\nIn some ways, Venezuela is lucky. In other places where socialism has been tried (and I include communism in this, because they're two sides of the same totalitarian coin), the body count climbs exponentially. But if you look at videos of Venezuelans celebrating in the streets of Caracas, one thing is clear: they will not miss their socialist overlords.\n\nFor right now, America is running the nation, until, according to President Trump, a \"safe, proper, and judicious transition\" can take place and while Venezuela is being freed from the shackles of socialism, parts of America are openly embracing the same ideology that pushed Venezuela from the world's fourth-richest nation into a poverty-stricken hellhole.\n\nThe face of that movement right now is New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani, who just condemned the ouster of his commie buddy as a violation of \"international law.\" It's not, of course, but Mamdani loves the idea of international law (so much so, he says New York is now a city of \"international law\"). Before the election, I wrote how the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) are using Mamdani's campaign as a springboard for the socialist takeover of America, both at the local level and in the Senate.\n\nThey are making the same promises the socialists made in Venezuela: they'll punish the rich, make things like education, healthcare, and housing \"free,\" and everyone will live in the \"warmth of collectivism.\"\n\nVenezuela did that for two decades, and — as I mentioned above — everyone in that country is now collectively poor. The Left looks \n\nWhen voters decided they were unhappy with Maduro's rule and voted him out of office, the so-called defenders of democracy only issued strongly-worded letters while Maduro actually stole the election and remained a dictator. Then again, Democrats really aren't big on democracy. Look at how they installed Kamala Harris as their nominee without a single vote last year.\n\nLook who is squawking the loudest about Maduro's ouster — it's the same group of people who are tripping over themselves to install the same brand of socialism here, knowing full well it'll have the same outcome. And what happens when voters decide they're fed up with socialism? Those so-called \"defenders of democracy\" will prove they're not a fan of free and fair elections after all.\n\nThe lesson from what happened in Venezuela today is this: it's very easy to vote in the socialists who promise you bread and roses, but it takes a military strike to get them out of office. There will be no nation willing to do what President Trump did in Venezuela for America, however.\n\nIt's up to us, therefore, to make sure we never go down that path in the first place.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/amy-curtis/2026/01/03/vip-venezuela-toppling-socialism-n2668811","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/357/1e791f1c-d321-4a2b-ba81-9f5e0a9d30b5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-03 23:30:29","author":"Amy Curtis","authors":["Amy Curtis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":391082782,"title":"US-Venuzuela strikes live updates: Nicolás Maduro, Cilia Flores land in New York, Donald Trump reveals plan","text":"Former US Vice President and unsuccessful Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris says Donald Trump’s actions in Venezuela do “not make America safer”.\n\nMs Harris said Mr Trump’s actions were motivated by oil and self-interest, not putting US citizens first.\n\n“That Maduro is a brutal, illegitimate dictator does not change the fact that this action was both unlawful and unwise.

Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James. \n\nOwens, 62, is the city’s 55th mayor in its 177-year history and the second woman to hold the position. She was joined on stage by her husband, Shaun Owens; her mother, Pastor Ester Daniels; and her two children, Simone and Isaac.\n\nOwens spoke about the city’s future with Micron expected to bring nearly 50,000 jobs to Central New York and the economic opportunities tied to the Interstate 81 viaduct project. \n\nOwens outlined a number of promises to the city.\n\nShe said she would pursue new housing by partnering with modular construction builders and seeking state and federal money. She promised to grow the ranks of the police and fire departments. She said she would invest in mental health programs and violence prevention initiatives.\n\nShe said she would listen before she speaks, and build coalitions -- likely a nod to her predecessor, Ben Walsh.\n\nAnd she said her administration will develop the long-languishing Inner Harbor.\n\n“I will not pretend — and I ask you not to pretend — that these problems have easy solutions. They don’t,” Owens said. “But I know something else with equal certainty: the people of Syracuse are fighters, and so am I. Innovation will be the key that unlocks our future.”\n\nAn official swearing-in ceremony was held Wednesday at Syracuse City Hall, where about 30 family members, friends, supporters, city officials and reporters crowded into the mayor’s office. \n\nSaturday’s public inauguration, however, drew attendees from across Syracuse and New York state. Owens also received a congratulatory letter from former Vice President Kamala Harris, who called her a true leader who has fought for access to health care and educational equity.\n\nAG James and Gov. Hochul took the stage to congratulate Owens and reflect on the city’s future.\n\n“Mayor Owens has that rare quality where she puts the people before she puts herself,” James said. “She’s worked tirelessly to restore and revitalize communities across the city, and she’s been a voice for those often relegated to the sidelines of public policy.”\n\nHochul said she plans to work closely with Owens on expanding affordable housing and continuing efforts to reduce violent crime.\n\n“We’ve worked hard with this administration to drive down the violent crime rate, and we’ve turned a corner,” Hochul said. “We’re going to keep that going because every life matters. We must keep our young people alive and give them hope.”\n\nThe loudest applause of the afternoon came when Owens’ mother, now in her 80s, took the microphone near the end of the ceremony. Owens wiped away tears as her mother spoke of her pride and said she hopes boys and girls watching will see the moment and say, “I can do that.”\n\nOwens said she is proud of her service at City Hall over the past eight years and plans to continue many of the initiatives launched during the Walsh administration. \n\nShe also emphasized that she will serve all Syracuse residents, regardless of whether they voted for her, and said she is ready to work for every person in the city.\n\n“Let’s do this, Syracuse,” Owens said. “Let’s move forward together and maximize what’s possible for our city.”","summary":"More than 1,500 people gathered at the Landmark Theatre Saturday for the ceremony, including Gov.

Here are a few left-wing activist groups to watch in the year ahead.\n\nMany left-wing groups have sued the Trump administration this past year, but the American Civil Liberties Union stands out. In its 2025 annual report, the ACLU touted having filed “over 110 lawsuits—53 of them within the first 100 days of the president’s second term.”\n\nThanks to rogue district court judges, the ACLU celebrated having “defeated, diluted, or delayed President Trump’s unconstitutional agenda” in 70% of cases. Many of these victories involved a judge issuing a temporary injunction against the administration, only to have the injunction lifted on appeal.\n\nThe ACLU fought to block Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations; it sued to protect the “birthright citizenship” abuse of the 14th Amendment; it claimed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act must cover abortion; and it sued on redistricting to enhance “Black voting power” in Alabama and Louisiana. It also released videos training illegal aliens to avoid immigration officials.\n\nEvery time the Trump administration acts to restore sanity in government, expect the ACLU to take Trump to court.\n\nSixteen Thirty Fund\n\nSixteen Thirty Fund, a key arm of the Left’s dark money network, bankrolls left-leaning groups, Democrat campaigns, and ballot initiatives across the U.S.\n\nSixteen Thirty Fund spent nearly $311 million in the 2024 election cycle, funding super PACs that supported Vice President Kamala Harris and Democrats running for U.S. Senate in red states. It backed an abortion ballot initiative in Florida and opposed redistricting in Ohio.\n\nThe dark money nonprofit also sponsors a project called Chorus, which trains pro-Democrat social media influencers.\n\nArabella Advisors, which provided management services to Sixteen Thirty Fund and other left-leaning nonprofits, has ostensibly disappeared, but one of its successor organizations (Sunflower Services) is still working with the 501(c)(3) “sisters” of Sixteen Thirty Fund. It remains unclear whether Sixteen Thirty Fund will have any relationship with Sunflower Services or with Vital Impact, the firm led by Arabella Advisors’ former CEO.\n\nSixteen Thirty Fund will likely support Democrats running for Senate, ballot initiatives, and redistricting campaigns ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe Center for American Progress\n\nThe Center for American Progress, an influential leftist think tank that fed dozens of staff into the Biden administration, has also opposed Trump.\n\nIn April, the Center for American Progress launched a map showing which congressional districts were ostensibly hurt by the grants terminated due to the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nIn December, the center released a report condemning “climate deniers” in Congress and in the administration, suggesting everyone in positions of authority must agree with the climate alarmist narrative.\n\nExpect the Center for American Progress to make more moves ahead of the midterms.\n\nNational Democratic Redistricting Committee\n\nTrump is attempting to shore up Republicans’ slim majority in the House of Representatives by engaging in redistricting, the process of redrawing the maps of congressional districts, after the 2020 census short-changed Republican-leaning states. Meanwhile, many on the Left have long pushed redistricting for political purposes. Obama-era Attorney General Eric Holder, for example, established a nonprofit dedicated to giving Democrats an edge in redistricting.\n\nThe National Democratic Redistricting Committee gave $150,000 to the Virginia House Democratic Caucus and another $150,000 to Democrat candidate Abigail Spanberger’s campaign before the off-year elections this past November, and Virginia Democrats backed a redistricting constitutional amendment one day afterward. \n\nThe National Democratic Redistricting Committee has opposed redistricting efforts in Texas and Florida, and it celebrated the failure of Indiana’s redistricting bill.\n\nIn July, the committee released a list of 13 priority states for 2025 and 2026, targeting next year’s governor’s races in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations bills itself as the largest Muslim civil rights group in America, but it recently sued Republican Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Ron DeSantis of Florida because they designated CAIR a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nCAIR has pushed the narrative that Israel is engaging in genocide in Gaza, opposed Trump’s deportations, and designated a sitting Republican U.S. senator an “anti-Muslim extremist.“\n\nCAIR does not align with other leftist groups on every issue. Notably, it defends Muslim parents’ rights to opt their kids out of LGBTQ lessons in school. However, it often teams up with other left-wing groups, particularly the Southern Poverty Law Center. \n\nFollowing the Minnesota fraud scandals, which heavily involved the majority Muslim Somali community, and the Afghan national’s November attack on National Guard members in Washington, D.C., Republicans are raising the alarm about radical Islam. Expect CAIR to lead the charge in demonizing these concerns.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has weaponized its history of suing Ku Klux Klan groups into bankruptcy, putting mainstream conservative and Christian groups on a “hate map” with Klan chapters. This map allows the SPLC to demonize its opponents and scare donors into ponying up cash. This strategy has contributed to the SPLC’s massive wealth, even while the “hate map” has inspired violence against conservatives. \n\nRepublicans have rightly drawn attention to the SPLC’s close relationship with the Biden administration, hosting a hearing on the SPLC. \n\nUnder Trump, the FBI has sworn off the SPLC, and the SPLC appears to be losing influence in corporate America, as well. That said, many on the Left still defend the organization, and it seems likely the SPLC will break new ground in demonizing conservatives next year. This year, it added Turning Point USA to the “hate map,” just months before Charlie Kirk’s assassination.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees, the largest public-sector union in the federal government, has fought to insulate the bureaucracy from Trump’s agenda. In doing so, it seeks to protect what amounts to a fourth branch of government, unaccountable to the people’s elected representatives.\n\nAFGE sued to block Trump’s reductions in force, his executive order blocking collective bargaining for federal employees in national security roles, the termination of contracts that unions negotiated in the final days of the Biden administration, and to undermine his DOGE efforts.\n\nThe union claimed that the president attacked “science itself” when questioning climate alarmism. It claimed Trump’s decision to eliminate so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion offices in the federal government was a “smokescreen for firing civil servants.”\n\nWhen Senate Democrats refused to pass a clean continuing resolution to fund the government during budget negotiations, leading to the longest government shutdown in American history, AFGE eventually tired of the charade and called on Congress to reopen the government. \n\nExpect AFGE to continue to oppose Trump’s efforts to reform the federal government, advancing Democrat narratives against the president.","summary":"Next year doesn&#8217;t just mark the 250th anniversary of the United States—it also means another year of President Donald Trump&#8217;s second term and impending midterm...

Instead, they believe that if they can't defeat their political opponents in terms of logic, reason, morals, facts or the law, then their next best bet is to co-opt the enemy's message and image without actually adopting their values..\n\nVoters witnessed the first tinges of this strategy in 2024 when Kamala Harris claimed her campaign wasn't woke (after years of saying Americans needed to be more woke) and Tim Walz pretended to be manly by talking about football and masculinity without knowing anything about either subject. \n\nIn 2025 going into 2026, however, the Democrats are taking their Talented Mr. Ripley routine to the next level. They don't just want to compete with conservative messages, they are trying to steal the conservative identity by proclaiming themselves to be the \"real\" American patriots.\n\nThe new activist narrative (largely organized and funded by NGOs) runs with 1776 symbolism, claims that the US military is really on their side, argues that they are the true guardians of the constitution and that their revolution is one that the Founding Fathers would applaud. \n\nIn tandem with the \"No Kings\" protests, Dems like Jasmine Crockett argued that MAGA is \"unpatriotic\" and anti-constitution. She believes Democrats are the true patriots and that they are the barrier protecting Americans from \"fascism.\" \n\nThis theme has led to a number of protests which have abandoned woke symbols in favor of a carefully crafted \"pro-America\" costume.

Democrat Rep. Hakeem Jeffries co-opted the words of Republican President Ulysses S. Grant as a strange justification for Democrat driven civil unrest, noting that \"There are but two parties in America right now, patriots and traitors...\" (conservatives, in his version of reality, being the traitors). \n\nHakeem Jeffries: \"There are but two parties in America right now, patriots and traitors.\"pic.twitter.com/oz5C7qSDVr\n— Thomas Sowell Quotes (@ThomasSowell) December 16, 2025\n\nKeep in mind, Democrat activists are the same people who have been celebrating the deconstruction of western culture for years and assert that the constitution is meaningless because it was \"written by slave owners.\"\n\nIn 2022 at the height of their pandemic frenzy, Democrats in blue states and blue cities widely supported a flurry of freedom crushing mandates and pushed hard for the creation of a vaccine passport system which would effectively destroy the Bill of Rights by taking away citizen access to the economy if they refused to be injected with an experimental jab.\n\nThat same year, a Heartland Institute and Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey found that 48% of voters favored President Joe Biden’s plan to impose a COVID-19 vaccine mandate on the employees of large companies and government agencies. The same survey showed that a disturbing number of Democrats also supported \"Chinese-style\" punishments for people who refused to take the jab.\n\nAround 55% of Democrat voters were in favor of government enforced fines for the unvaccinated. Nearly 60% supported forced home confinement for the unvaccinated. 48% of Democrats were in favor of fines and prison time for anyone who publicly questioned the efficacy of the vaccines. Around 45% of Democrats supported the idea of confining the unvaccinated to \"designated facilities\" (covid camps) until they complied. 47% of Democrats favored the use of digital tracking for the unvaccinated.\n\nAround 30% of progressive voters suggested taking children away from parents who refused to vaccinate. The Biden Administration and Democrats were exposed for violating constitutional law in their efforts to pressure social media companies to silence and censor conservative critics of covid policies (among other things). \n\nAnyone who stood against the mandates was accused of being a threat to democracy and a potential terrorist. The Democrats initiated a propaganda war against US patriots; a war which they ultimately lost. Now, they want you to forget all about their many trespasses and accept their new image as \"freedom fighters\" saving the country from Trump's tyrannical policies...which the majority of Americans voted for.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/democrats-now-claim-they-are-real-american-patriots","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2025-12/ICEprotest1.jpg?itok=b5kI5TCl","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-03 16:05:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.349},{"id":391031330,"title":"Mark Z. Barabak: Democrats are on a roll. So why not fight one another?","text":"Democrats are starting the new year on a high.\n\nA series of 2025 victories, in red and blue states alike, was marked by a striking improvement over the party's 2024 showing. That over-performance, to use the political term of art, means candidates - including even some who lost - received a significantly higher percentage of the vote than presidential candidate Kamala Harris managed.\n\nThat's a strong signal ahead of the midterm election, suggesting Democratic partisans are energized, a key ingredient in any successful campaign, and the party is winning support among independents and perhaps even a few disaffected Republicans.\n\nIf history is a guide and the uneven economy a portent, Democrats will very likely seize control of the House in November, picking up at least the three seats needed to erase the GOP's bare majority. The Senate looks to be a longer - though not impossible - reach, given the Republican lean of the states being contested.\n\nIn short, Democrats are in much better shape than all the black crepe and existential ideations suggested a year ago.\n\nYes, the party suffered a soul-crushing defeat in the presidential race. But 2024 was never the disaster some made it out to be. Democrats gained two House seats and held their own in most contests apart from the fight for the Senate, where several Republican states reverted to form and ousted the chamber's few remaining Democratic holdouts.\n\nStill, Democrats being Democrats, all is not happiness and light in the party of Jefferson, Jackson, Clinton and Obama.\n\nCampaigning to become the party's chairman, Ken Martin last winter promised to conduct a thorough review of the 2024 election and to make its findings public, as a step toward redressing Democrats' mistakes and bolstering the party going forward.\n\n\"What we need to do right now is really start to get a handle around what happened,\" he told reporters before his election.\n\nNow Martin has decided to bury that autopsy report.\n\n\"Here's our North Star: Does this help us win?\" he said in a mid-December statement announcing his turnabout and the study's unceremonious interment. \"If the answer is no, it's a distraction from the core mission.\"\n\nThere is certainly no shortage of 2024 election analyses for the asking. The sifting of rubble, pointing of fingers and laying of blame began an eye blink after Donald Trump was declared the winner.\n\nThere are prescriptions from the moderate and progressive wings of the party - suggesting, naturally, that Democrats absolutely must move their direction to stand any chance of ever winning again. There are diagnoses from a welter of 2028 presidential hopefuls, declared and undeclared, offering themselves as both seer and Democratic savior.\n\nThe report Martin commissioned was, however, supposed to be the definitive word from the party, offering both a clear-eyed look back and a clarion way forward.\n\n\"We know that we lost ground with Latino voters,\" he said in those searching days before he became party chairman. \"We know we lost ground with women and younger voters and, of course, working-class voters. We don't know the how and why yet.\"\n\nAs part of the investigation, more than 300 Democrats were interviewed in each of the 50 states. But there was good reason to doubt the integrity of the report, even before Martin pulled out his shovel and started digging.\n\nAccording to the New York Times and others, there was no plan to examine President Biden's headstrong decision to seek reelectiondespite his advanced age and no intention to second-guess any of the strategic decisions Harris made in her hurry-up campaign.\n\nWhich is like setting out to solve a murder by ignoring the weapon used and skipping past the cause of death.\n\nCurious, indeed.\n\nStill, there was predictable outrage when Martin went back on his promise.\n\n\"This is a very bad decision that reeks of the caution and complacency that brought us to this moment,\" Dan Pfeiffer, an alumnus of the Obama White House, posted on social media.\n\n\"The people who volunteered, donated and voted deserve to know what went wrong,\" Jamal Simmons, a former Harris vice presidential advisor, told the Hill newspaper. \"The DNC should tell them.\"\n\nIn 2013, Republicans commissioned a similar after-action assessment following Mitt Romney's loss to President Obama. It was scathing in its blunt-force commentary.\n\nThe 98-page report said a smug, uncaring, ideologically rigid party was turning off voters with stale policies that had changed little in decades and was unhelpfully projecting an image that alienated minorities and young voters.\n\nAmong its recommendation, the postmortem called on the party to develop \"a more welcoming brand of conservatism\" and suggested an extensive set of \"inclusion\" proposals for minority groups, including Latinos, Asians and African Americans. (DEI, anyone?)\n\n\"Unless changes are made,\" the report concluded, \"it will be increasingly difficult for Republicans to win another presidential election in the near future.\"\n\nTrump, of course, won the White House three years later doing precisely none of what the report recommended.\n\nWhich suggests the Democratic autopsy, buried or otherwise, is not likely to matter a whole lot when voters go to the polls. (It's the affordability, stupid.)\n\nThat said, Martin should have released the appraisal and not just because of the time and effort invested. There was already Democratic hostility toward the chairman, particularly among donors unhappy with his leadership and performance, and his entombing of the autopsy report won't help.\n\nMartin gave his word, and breaking it is a needless distraction and blemish on the party.\n\nBesides, a bit of thoughtful self-reflection is never a bad thing. It's hard to look forward when you've got your head stuck in the sand.\n\nTribune National\n\nThis story was originally published January 3, 2026 at 8:03 AM.","url":"https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/us-viewpoints/article314142697.html","image":"https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/public/incoming/bdbote/picture314142348/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/f8fcf3d5-1835-4a97-8099-5a8b922ea82d","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-03 16:03:56","author":"Saul Loeb/pool","authors":["Saul Loeb/pool"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.325}]}
