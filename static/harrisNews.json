The Gallup poll, released Friday, found that 52 percent of Americans said they and their family are worse off today than they were four years ago. The Gallup poll was conducted Sept. 16-28 among 1,023 Americans and has a margin of error of 4 percentage points. Another 39 percent said they were better off, while 9 percent said they felt the same now as they did back then. Gallup noted that these results are most similar to their 1992 survey – when then-Gov. Bill Clinton defeated incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush. FOX NEWS POLL: TRUMP AHEAD OF HARRIS BY 2 POINTS NATIONALLY The responses varied on the person's party affiliation. About 72% of Democrats say they were better off in 2024 than 2020, according to the survey. The numbers were much lower for independents, 35%, and Republicans, just 7%. The polling powerhouse noted that participant's response to whether they felt \"better off\" was typically tied to the U.S. economy. Gallup’s monthly Economic Confidence Index (ECI), which ranges from -100 to +100, was currently at -26, with 39 percent saying they were better off financially four years ago. TRIO OF NEW POLLS AGREE ON WHERE TRUMP AND HARRIS STAND WITH 3 WEEKS TO GO UNTIL ELECTION DAY The organization has been tracking ECI's since 1992. Since the start, the highest ECI score was +56 in January 2000, and the lowest was -72 in October 2008. Gallup noted that former President Trump's 2020 loss to now-President Biden was a \"sign that noneconomic factors were paramount to voters that year.\" America's Economic Confidence Remains Low: Gallup noted that the ECI has largely been negative over the past four years. In 2022, the index registered several scores that were the worst since the 2007-2009 recession and inflation reached highs. During the past three years, Americans have named inflation as the most important financial problem facing their family. The survey's findings suggest that inflation is an underlying fear of many Americans' perception of the economy – despite the generally low unemployment and steady economic growth. Approximately 46 percent of Americans say their current economic conditions are \"poor,\" some 29 percent described them as \"only fair,\" while 25 percent said they were \"good\" or \"excellent.\" Additionally, 62 percent said the economy is \"getting worse,\" while 32% said in the survey that it is \"getting better.\" CRUNCH TIME: KAMALA HARRIS TO TEAM UP WITH THE OBAMAS NEXT WEEK Top Issues in the 2024 Election: The survey found key areas that were on the top of voter's minds as they headed to the polls.

Vicente Gonzalez and former Republican Congresswoman Mayra Flores squared off in their only debate before election day, with both candidates focusing on the economy and illegal immigration.\n\nThe televised debate took place in the heavily Hispanic Texas District 34 on Oct. 17, in a race that could determine which party controls Congress.\n\nGonzalez and Flores, who are in a rematch for the district seat, clashed over voting records and positions, often talking over each other.\n\nBoth parties have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on the race. Republicans have been putting more money into South Texas in hopes of increasing their share of Latino voters in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nOn inflation, one of the top issues, Flores contrasted the current high prices under the Biden-Harris administration to those under former President Donald Trump, who is seeking a second term in the White House.\n\nFlores said Democrats drove up inflation by overspending, which included sending billions of dollars overseas when Americans at home were hurting.\n\n“We have to put Washington on a budget. You know, Americans are on a budget, living paycheck to paycheck,” she said.\n\nGonzalez said inflation was caused by the global pandemic, adding that prices are coming down under the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nHe blamed grocery stores for high food prices, saying they were gouging consumers.\n\n“Clearly, meat prices, poultry prices, egg prices are higher than they should be, but we’ve got to go after corporate price gougers,” he said.\n\nGonzalez called for a government crackdown on “bad actors” taking advantage of consumers, an idea proposed by Vice President Kamala Harris, who is vying to keep the White House in the hands of Democrats.\n\nBoth candidates thought the minimum wage should be increased, with Gonzalez calling for $15 per hour.\n\nGonzalez said the immigration process has been broken for decades. One way to fix it, he said, was through the Safe Zones Act, which he introduced.\n\nThat would establish facilities in countries such as Guatemala, El Salvador, and Panama where asylum seekers could apply and await processing, he said.\n\nMigrants who bypassed those centers and attempted to cross the southern border illegally would be deported under the bill, he added.\n\nOn the issue of abortion, Gonzalez, who is Catholic, said he does not promote abortion, but he would never support a national abortion ban.\n\nHe accused Flores of supporting such a ban and working against in vitro fertilization (IVF) for co-sponsoring the Life at Conception Act while she was in office.\n\nThe bill didn’t pass but defined life as beginning at conception and didn’t include an exception for IVF.\n\n“It’s a national abortion ban. You need to read your own bills,” Gonzalez said.\n\nFlores said that as a mother of four children, she supports IVF as part of her pro-life stance but was not in favor of a national abortion ban.\n\nThe abortion issue has particularly attracted attention in Texas because it has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country.\n\nIt does not allow for the exceptions of rape or incest.\n\nHowever, it does permit abortions to save a pregnant woman’s life or prevent “substantial impairment of major bodily function.”\n\nThe debate was contentious at times, with Flores accusing Gonzalez of “pretending” to be a moderate while supporting leftwing causes such as transgender surgery for kids and men playing in women’s sports.\n\n“You don’t know what a woman is,” Flores said during the debate.\n\nDuring the campaign, the National Republican Congressional Committee helped her with an ad accusing Gonzalez of pushing “sex changes for kids.”\n\nIn the debate, Gonzalez countered by claiming Flores supported Project 2025, which she denied.\n\nDemocrats have attempted to tie Republicans to the plan—developed by the Heritage Foundation—that they consider extreme. Republicans deny involvement in the plan.\n\nDuring closing statements, Gonzalez touted his support for legislation to bring money to South Texas, saying $8 billion in resources have been earmarked to transform infrastructure in the region.\n\nHe said it was essential to take care of veterans and seniors and to support education.\n\nFlores, a legal immigrant from Mexico, focused on the economy in her final statement during the debate, asking voters if they were better off now or four years ago.\n\n“I need you to vote with your pockets. I need you to prioritize the needs of your family and your children,” she said.\n\nGonzalez is running for his fifth term in Congress. He is favored to win District 34, having defeated Flores by 8.5 percentage points in 2022.\n\nHowever, political analysts have said the seat is vulnerable and could be flipped.\n\nFlores, who focused her campaign on “God, family, and country” in 2022, won a special election to fill the seat temporarily that year before being defeated by Gonzalez later in the general election.","summary":"The race for Texas Congressional District 34 is one of a handful nationwide that could decide which party controls Congress.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/gonzalez-flores-debate-in-texas-rematch-for-us-house-seat-5743715","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/10/19/id5743994-GettyImages-1153288577-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 00:10:41","author":"Darlene McCormick Sanchez","authors":["Darlene McCormick Sanchez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.374},{"id":260258194,"title":"What’s a ‘Jezebel spirit’? Some Christians use the term to paint Kamala Harris with a demonic brush","text":"Christian nationalist leaders are telling followers that Vice President Kamala Harris is under the influence of a “Jezebel spirit,” using a term with deeply racist and misogynistic roots that is setting off alarm bells for religious and political scholars.\n\nThe concept is inspired by the biblical story of the evil Queen Jezebel, who persecuted prophets and was punished with a horrible death. The word “Jezebel” was used during slavery and throughout U.S. history to describe Black women, casting them as overtly sexual and untrustworthy.\n\nIn the context of “Jezebel spirit,” the term has sinister connotations, suggesting the person is under the influence of demons in a spiritual battle between good and evil. People who have studied the Jan. 6 insurrection warn that similar rhetoric on spiritual warfare drove many to the U.S. Capitol that day.\n\n“People … are hearing this woman is possessed by a demonic spirit that is hardcore, terrible, hates men, hates authority, is going to do whatever she wants to do,” said Anthea Butler, professor at the University of Pennsylvania and author of the book “White Evangelical Racism,” who has studied the New Apostolic Reformation.\n\nThe term, Butler said, is coded language to communicate that the person – a woman, usually a Democrat, Black or multiracial – is not an acceptable candidate. Harris is a Christian and a Baptist, but when faith leaders tie her to Jezebel, Butler said it suggests falsely that she is non-Christian.\n\nIn the Old Testament, Jezebel is among the vilest of villains. She was a foreign-born queen who wielded great power, persecuted prophets and worshiped false gods. Ultimately, she was punished by being thrown out a window, trampled by a horse, then eaten by dogs.\n\nLater in the Bible, a Jezebel appears as a false prophet portending the end times and promoting sexual promiscuity.\n\nThe term has a long history of being used in the U.S. against women, especially Black women. During times of slavery, the idea was used to justify the systemic sexual assault and rape of Black women and girls. It has been used in the past to target other women such as Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama, and to categorize movements such as feminism, abortion rights and LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nConceptualizing female candidates through the “Jezebel spirit” is dangerous, said Tamura Lomax, author of the book “Jezebel Unhinged” and associate professor of religious studies at Michigan State University.\n\n“Any woman who is stepping into her power in any kind of way, is going to be seen as this Jezebel who is deserving of violence,” she said.\n\nWho is using the term? And why?\n\nThe usage comes from a politicized movement of charismatic Christianity called the New Apostolic Reformation, a decentralized yet highly networked movement whose leaders widely teach that demonic forces are involved in spiritual warfare and can speak through people. In this case, the Jezebel spirit is a demon who is at work on earth and has the qualities of the Bible’s Jezebel, although the phrase “Jezebel spirit” never appears in the Bible.\n\nThe language is used to galvanize and catalyze Christians with apocalyptic sensibilities with messages that the next election is “do or die,” said Matthew Taylor, whose new book, “The Violent Take It By Force,” provides a history of the New Apostolic Reformation and details its influence in the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\n“It’s used as a means of justifying aggression,” Taylor said. “Christians are supposed to love their enemies. … But Christians are allowed to hate demons.”\n\nAnd some people could use that militant rhetoric to justify real-world violence, he said.\n\nThe movement was on prominent display on Jan. 6, Taylor said, as believers waged “spiritual warfare” at the Capitol. As the attack took place, people sang religious songs, prayed and blew shofars – a horn in Jewish tradition that has been adopted by Christian nationalists, inspired by their use in the biblical Battle of Jericho.\n\nSince that day, Taylor said, there has been a huge increase in talk of spiritual warfare in American politics.\n\nChristian nationalism is a fusion of American and Christian identities that seeks a privileged place for Christianity in American public life.\n\nLance Wallnau, who has 1 million Facebook followers and is one of the leaders who has used “Jezebel spirit” to describe Harris, is considered a prophet in the New Apostolic Reformation, according to Taylor, and says he receives messages directly from God. He was an early evangelical supporter of Trump and remains close to his campaign. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance recently appeared at an event organized by Wallnau.\n\nThe Trump and Harris campaigns did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWallnau posted a video on X in which he said, “with Kamala you have a Jezebel spirit, a characteristic in the Bible, that is a Jezebel spirit. The personification of intimidation, seduction, domination and manipulation,” he said, adding. “She can look presidential and that’s the seduction of what I would say is witchcraft.” In a different video, he said Harris represents “an amalgam of the spirit of Jezebel in a way that’ll be even more ominous than Hillary (Clinton), because she’ll bring a racial component, and she’s younger.”\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is described by some preachers with New Apostolic Reformation ties as being anointed by God, fighting on the side of the angels.\n\nWallnau didn’t respond to the AP’s attempts to reach him for comment. But after backlash over his use of the “Jezebel spirit” rhetoric, Wallnau posted on X to clarify his thoughts on Harris.\n\n“For the record, Kamala isn’t a demon and no living soul on planet earth is a demon. However people, political parties and organizational structures can be under demonic influence,” Wallnau wrote Sept. 29.\n\nThe language has seeped into down ballot races as well. In Indiana, the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor said that the election is between “strength and godly boldness” on the state Republican ticket and the “Jezebel spirit” on the Democratic ticket, which is led by three women.\n\nMicah Beckwith, a pastor, and self-proclaimed Christian nationalist, did not respond to voicemails and text messages seeking clarity on his comment. Beckwith told the IndyStar this month that his comment was not about gender but Democratic ideas.\n\nOn Oct. 12, thousands gathered to pray at the National Mall where Ché Ahn, a leader in the New Apostolic Reformation, decreed that that Trump is a “type of Jehu,” the biblical figure who overthrew Jezebel’s reign and ordered her death. Ahn, who did not respond to the Associated Press seeking comment, pleaded with the crowd to get out and vote.\n\n“I decree it by faith that Trump will win on November the 5th,” he told the crowd. “He will be our 47th president and Kamala Harris will be cast out.”","summary":"The word 'Jezebel' was used during slavery and throughout U.S. history to describe Black women, casting them as overtly sexual and untrustworthy.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/10/18/whats-a-jezebel-spirit-some-christians-use-the-term-to-paint-kamala-harris-with-a-demonic-brush/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/10/Election_2024-_Jezebel_spirit_45456.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 00:05:21","author":"Isabella Volmert And Michelle R.

Harris was citing a Politico report that said several Trump interviews that were in the works had failed to come to fruition because the 78-year-old Republican nominee was \"exhausted.\" A Trump campaign spokesperson told Politico that was \"unequivocally false.\"\"Look, being president of the United States is probably one of the hardest jobs in the world. And so we really do need to ask, if he's exhausted being on the campaign trail, is he fit to do the job? And I think that's an open-ended question and we need an answer,\" Harris said. Harris said it's a \"legitimate question,\" adding, \"it should be a concern if he can't handle the rigors of the campaign trail.\" Trump has yet to release his recent medical records, claiming Friday, \"you've got them all.\" His campaign has said he's in \"perfect and excellent health\" to be president. In November 2023, Trump shared a letter from his doctor of osteopathic medicine that said he had been examined in September 2023 and that his \"overall health is excellent.\" The letter did not give specifics on his vitals or medications. \"I've done five exams over the last four years,\" Trump told CBS News as he campaigned in Michigan. When pressed on whether he had actually released all of his medical records, Trump called on Harris to take a cognitive test. \"Obviously, I'm in the middle of a very big and very contentious fight we're leading,\" he said. \"I've given my health exams. I've also done cognitive tests twice, and I've aced them, meaning a perfect score. I want to see her do a cognitive test because she couldn't, because she wasn't born smart.\" Trump also said he's \"gone 48 days now without a rest,\" adding, \"I'm not even tired, I'm really exhilarated.\" If elected in November, Trump would be the oldest person to ever assume the Oval Office. Harris released a letter from her doctor last week that said she is in \"excellent health\" and \"possesses the physical and mental resiliency\" required to serve as president. Her physician, Dr. Joshua Simmons, said Harris' latest blood work and other test results were \"unremarkable,\" and that she has no personal history of high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiac disease, neurological disorders or other serious conditions. He noted that she has a history of allergies and urticaria, also known as hives, for which she has been on allergen immunotherapy for the past three years.In a recent letter, more than 230 doctors, nurses and health care professionals, most of whom are backing Harris, called on Trump to release his health records, arguing he was \"displaying alarming characteristics of declining acuity.\" Absent detailed records, the letter said, \"we are left to extrapolate from public appearances.\"","summary":"\"If he's exhausted being on the campaign trail, is he fit to do the job?\" Harris asked as Trump refuses to release detailed medical records.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harris-questions-trump-health-medical-records/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/10/18/8f0e830f-f6bc-460e-ba6c-218303d306e0/thumbnail/1200x630/9d6f01366a53bf47ffbc4726e7f9559e/gettyimages-2178420840.jpg?v=edba3a63b5392b4c81ae19d894992d91","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3261761_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-10-19 00:03:25","author":"Caitlin Yilek","authors":["Caitlin Yilek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.078},{"id":260257848,"title":"\"It raises real questions\": Harris questions Trump's fitness after media, rally cancellations","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris blasted former President Donald Trump for becoming “exhausted” by his campaign schedule on Friday, arguing that anyone without the stamina to run a campaign can't be an effective president.\n\n“He is ducking debates and canceling interviews.

all","text":"On the campaign trail this month, former President Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed to “close the federal Department of Education” and expand school choice — a wildly popular concept that cuts across party lines, new polling shows.\n\nGood news: If he wins the White House again, he can do both.\n\nThe federal Department of Education is an unconstitutional waste of time and money. \n\nIts very existence arguably violates the Tenth Amendment: The word “education” appears nowhere in the Constitution. \n\nThe federal government has spent well over a trillion dollars on K-12 education since the department’s inception, while failing to improve student performance.\n\nIt was created in 1980, at the tail end of President Jimmy Carter’s single term in office, as a payoff to the nation’s largest teachers’ union after it endorsed his unsuccessful re-election bid.\n\nTrump wants no part of it. \n\n“I’m going to take the Department of Education, close it in Washington,” he said at a September rally in Pennsylvania. \n\n“Let the states run their own education.” \n\nHe makes a good point. \n\nThe federal government could send the department’s budget back to the states so they can have more education funding to spend as they see fit.\n\nThat would allow for more local control — and less wasteful spending on useless bureaucrats in Washington. \n\nBut if Trump dismantled the federal education bureaucracy, could he also fulfill his separate commitment to unleash school choice?\n\nYes — and here’s how.\n\nThe Educational Choice for Children Act is a bill to set up a nationwide school-choice plan that would be neither run nor regulated by the federal Education Department. \n\nDuring a Fox News interview on Friday, Trump said he would sign it.\n\nAs a federal tax-credit scholarship initiative, ECCA would allow taxpayers to keep more of their own money if they donate to K-12 scholarship programs in their states.\n\nThe idea is popular: A poll released this week found that 69% of American voters “support a federal tax credit that would allow parents to send their students to a school of their choice, including private schools,” according to The Center Square — including 62% of Democrats and 77% of Republicans. \n\nAnd a bill to make that happen is already moving through Congress.\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee passed ECCA last month along party lines, with all Republicans voting in favor and all Democrats in opposition.\n\nIt’s the first time in American history a nationwide school-choice initiative has advanced out of a congressional committee.\n\nThe bill creates a federal tax benefit for private donors to give to K-12 scholarship organizations. \n\nFamilies can use the scholarships for private-school tuition, tutoring, special needs services, education technology and curriculum materials. \n\nThe idea isn’t unprecedented. \n\nTwenty-one states already have school-choice programs in the form of tax-credit scholarships.\n\nFlorida, for example, launched its tax-credit scholarship initiative in 2001. \n\nNow, nearly half a million students have been awarded scholarships through private school-choice programs in the Sunshine State.\n\nOver the same period, Florida’s education system has climbed to the top of the national rankings — despite spending 27% less than the national average per student.\n\nECCA would benefit families in red states that already have school choice by giving them additional resources to make private education more affordable.\n\nMore importantly, it would give some form of school choice to families in blue states — end-running local lawmakers beholden to the teachers’ unions.\n\nSchool choice is a rising tide that lifts all boats. \n\nNationwide, 26 of the 29 studies on the topic have found that school-choice competition improves outcomes in public schools, forcing them to up their game in response to the competition.\n\nThe next step is for the bill to advance to the House floor, where it has strong Republican support. \n\nIn fact, 153 GOP representatives — about 70% of the caucus — are already listed as cosponsors of ECCA.\n\nAnd no wonder: School choice has become a GOP litmus-test issue after conservative parents in particular witnessed left-wing indoctrination in public schools during COVID-era remote learning.\n\nThe bill’s chance of success is unlikely in the Democrat-controlled Senate, although a majority of its voters support the concept — because the party is a subsidiary of the teachers’ unions.\n\nOver 99% of campaign contributions from Randi Weingarten’s American Federation of Teachers went to Democrats last election cycle, as they have for decades.Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are in lockstep with the unions: The 2024 Democratic Party Platform opposes school choice.\n\nBut with 31 Senate Republicans already signed on to ECCA and the GOP expected to take control of the chamber after November’s elections, nationwide school choice has a real shot at getting across the finish line in 2025 — if Republicans also hold the House and Donald Trump wins.\n\nThat kind of momentum would embolden them to send education back to the states for good by abolishing the federal Department of Education, too.\n\nCorey DeAngelis is a senior fellow at the American Culture Project and author of “The Parent

released more evidence of the allegations against him.\n\nThe 1900-page dossier included how the then president drank soda while watching a mob of his supporters ransack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 as well as descriptions of his conversations with family members and aides.\n\nTrump said the decision to release the information now, barely two weeks before polling day, amounted to election interference. \n\n‘He’s a deranged lunatic,’ Trump told reporters after landing in Detroit for a campaign event, and he pointed out that Smith had failed to prosecute him over documents found at Mar-a-Lago, after the case was tossed by a judge in July.\n\n‘There is no case.

The community is happy to be in the spotlight","text":"It was Donald Trump's mispronunciation that first caught attention.\n\n“Also, we have many Asur-Asians in our room,” Trump said at a weekend rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona. “We have some incredible people in our room.”\n\nAsur-Asians?\n\nIt turns out the former president was trying to shout out a small group of Assyrians supporting his campaign. They'd been given prominent seats right behind him, donning red “Assyrians for Trump” shirts as he spoke in a packed arena 90 minutes north of Phoenix.\n\nAssyrians, a Christian indigenous group tracing their ancestry to ancient Mesopotamia in the modern Middle East, are a tiny minority community in the United States, but they happen to have significant communities in two of the seven swing states that will decide the Nov. 5 election, Michigan and Arizona. That could give them outsized influence in an election that polls show is essentially tied. \n\n“Thank you, President Trump, for making a mistake in our name,” said Sam Darmo, a Phoenix real estate agent and a co-founder of Assyrians for Trump who was seated behind the president at the rally. “Because you know what? Assyrians became very famous. More Americans know who the Assyrians are today than they did back on Sunday.”\n\nAssyrians hail from portions of what is now Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey. They are descendants of a powerful Middle Eastern empire and early followers of Christianity whose language is a form of Aramaic, the language scholars believe Jesus Christ spoke. \n\nMany Assyrians, some identifying as Chaldean or Syriac, have fled centuries of persecution and genocide in their homeland, most recently at the hands of the Islamic State group. Ancient relics have been destroyed or stolen and trafficked.\n\nAbout 95,000 people living in the United States identify their ancestry as Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac, according to U.S. Census Bureau data from 2022. By far the largest concentration is in Michigan, a battleground state home to 38,000 Assyrians. About 5,000 Assyrians live in Arizona. The other five battleground states have fewer than 500 Assyrians each. California and the Chicago area also have large Assyrian communities but are not politically competitive. \n\nThroughout the global Assyrian diaspora, the community has pushed to build monuments to preserve the memory of the atrocities they have faced, including the 1915 deportation and massacre of Assyrians, Armenians and Greeks by the Ottoman Turks. They've also pushed to convince local and national governments to formally recognize the massacre as a genocide, a term widely accepted by historians. Such declarations are vehemently fought by Turkey, which denies the deaths constituted genocide, saying the toll has been inflated and that those killed were victims of civil war and unrest.\n\nTrump pronounced Assyrian correctly in an interview released Thursday with podcaster Patrick Bet-David, who is Assyrian and Armenian. \n\n“You know why they were there?” Trump said. “They were so nice. I met them, the Assyrians. They said, 'Could you give us a shout out?' I said, ‘Who are you?’ I didn’t know. They said, ‘We’re Assyrians.' I said, ‘What’s that mean?’ But they were really nice people. But I said — I think I mispronounced it.”\n\nDarmo confirmed Trump's account, saying he asked Trump for the favor while four Assyrians posed with Trump before the rally. He said the former president instructed an aide to add a shoutout to the teleprompter and speculated that the aide may have misspelled Assyrians in the script. \n\n“We want the Americans to know who we are, and how much we suffered, and how many massacres, genocides have been committed against our people in the Middle East,” Darmo said. \n\nTrump sent his son, Eric Trump, to court Assyrians in Phoenix shortly before the 2020 election. \n\nRamond Takhsh, director of advocacy and outreach for the Assyrian American Association of Southern California, said the community, like all ethnic groups, is not monolithic, and the reaction to Trump's mangled shout-out was not universal. \n\n“We have a diverse spectrum of political viewpoints just like any other ethnic group,” Takhsh said. “Some Assyrians are happy with the recognition that came from former President Trump’s mispronunciation but some are not.”\n\nMona Oshana, an Iraqi-born Assyrian American who co-founded Assyrians for Trump during his first campaign, said the GOP is a good fit for a religious population that fled persecution by authoritarian governments. \n\n“We are an America First community because we came to America based on the echo of freedom and the Constitution,” Oshana said. “We often say we were Americans before coming to America, because we believed in the liberties of America, we believed in the Constitution, we believed in the fight of America.”\n\nDemocratic Vice President Kamala Harris ' campaign also has a grassroots organizing group, Chaldeans and Assyrians for Harris Walz, which is particularly active in Michigan. \n\nSome in the Assyrian community were infuriated by Trump's immigration policies, which significantly curtailed refugee resettlement in the United States. Some were affected by his travel ban restricting entry to the country from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iran, Iraq and Syria. \n\nA low point was the 2019 death in Baghdad of a 41-year-old Chaldean man who had lived in the U.S. since he was an infant. Jimmy Al-Daoud, who had a history of diabetes and mental illness, was deported for committing multiple crimes in the U.S.","summary":"Assyrian Americans got an influx of attention when former President Donald Trump mangled the word “Assyrian” while giving a shout out at a rally in Arizona","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-donald-trump-michigan-united-states-turkey-b2631954.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/19/00/Election_2024_Trump_14793.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-18 23:46:30","author":"Jonathan J.

His New Videos Prove It","text":"At a time when mystique can be in short supply in pop, leave it to Justin Vernon to revert to the age-old tradition of being a little more mysterious. Start with Sable, the new record by his band Bon Iver, their first new release in five years. Other than Beyoncé’s gap from Lemonade to Renaissance, how many major acts take that long between records?\n\n Then, notice that Sable is an EP consisting of only three tunes. We’ve lately seen a trend toward relatively compact 10-or-so-song albums (Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, Maggie Rogers, Ice Spice) after years of overstuffed and overlong records. But in this case, we’ve waited all this time and are rewarded with barely 15 minutes of music? Again, go figure, but you’ve got to admire the eccentricity of it all.\n\n Bon Iver’s music has always been lyrically furtive and musically pliable, which is still the case on its three tracks, which his camp is dubbing “an externalized projection of his turmoil … an unburdening from one of the most trying eras in Vernon’s life. There was a time not long ago where Vernon intentionally hid his face. Here, the blinds are open.” That was certainly true of “Speyside,” the initial video from Sable, released about a month ago. In it, a pained-looking Vernon is seen, eyes often closed, resting on a bed as a breeze blows curtains around close to his face. But at least you could see his face. \n\n In the other two Sable videos, both released today, Vernon is back to his shadowy, clandestine self. In “Things Behind Things Behind Things,” he’s mostly seen sitting and plucking his guitar in what looks like a darkened barn. On record, “Awards Season” (directed, like the previous two clips, by Erinn Springer) finds him comforting himself and his new partner by cranking some Rickie Lee Jones records and admitting, “You can be remade/You can live again/ What was pain now’s gained/A new path gets laid.” In the video, though, he’s again Bon Enigma. We’re exposed to gossamer clouds, full moons and a couple making out more than we see Vernon, who’s primarily glimpsed back in that murky room or on what looks like a TV screen.\n\n In August, Vernon resurfaced to play at a Kamala Harris/Tim Walz campaign event in his home state of Wisconsin, where he played the Civil War-era “Rally ‘Round the Flag” and a few of his own songs. As he told Rolling Stone, “You’re playing these Bon Iver songs that aren’t exactly ‘kick your feet up, dance and get excited!’ But when we played ‘Rally ’Round the Flag,’ t felt like we’d settled in, and that was the purpose of the day — to get that music out in the air for those people at that moment.”\n\n Vernon then spent some time with Harris and Walz in a friend’s food store. “When Biden dropped out, it was feeling very scary,” he said. “Then there was relief. And then the momentum of that relief has turned into actual excitement and a feeling we haven’t had for a long time in this country. I told Vice President Harris and Coach Walz and their staff, ‘We will be anywhere.’”","summary":"At a time when mystique can be in short supply in pop, leave it to Justin Vernon to revert to the age-old tradition of being a little more mysterious.

Think of her track record dealing with the border and crime, and how it might impact you and your kid’s personal safety. Think of her flip-flopping on strategic issues. Does the public know what Kamala’s policies might really do? Does she understand values vs. actions?\n\nAs for leadership and what’s best for the country, and watching Kamala in recent interviews, I’ll take my chances with Donald Trump and JD Vance.

This isn’t a matter of genes but of unvarnished racism.\n\nUnless all of one’s ancestors are Inuit, Hawaiian or Native American — the inhabitants of the states before colonization — then all of us are descended from immigrants. And that is not a bad thing.\n\nThe television series “Bob Hearts Abishola” focused on immigrants making their way in Detroit. Chuck Lorre, the creator of the show, often put this reminder in the final credits: “IMAG. Immigrants Made America Great.”\n\nI really don’t worry about the content of Trump’s veins.

is weird, insulting and RACIST","text":"We’re not sure what the Harris-Walz campaign was thinking when it came up with Kamala Harris’ “Opportunity Agenda for Black Men,” but it sure is insulting as well as bizarre.\n\nThe list of policy priorities to help black men “meet their full ambitions” is a weird mix of the blatantly unconstitutional, the irrelevant and the seemingly racist.\n\nShe starts with a promise for a million small-business loans, fully forgivable up to $20,000, for black entrepreneurs “and others who have historically faced barriers to starting a new business” — language that the courts have struck down as unconstitutional racial discrimination.\n\n(In classic Harris-Walz butt-covering, an anonymous campaign aide later told The Wall Street Journal that the program wouldn’t be racially exclusive, which means it wouldn’t be especially pro-black after all — but the campaign’s done nothing official about that shift.)\n\nHarris also promises to legalize marijuana and create “opportunities for Black Americans to succeed in this new industry,” which sure looks like a racist assumption that African-Americans have some special, intrinsic affinity for pot.\n\nOr maybe it’s just a bid to make up for the well-established fact that, as San Francisco DA, Harris convicted black men by the thousands for marijuana-related crimes?\n\nAlso tossed into the “plan” is a vow to “protect cryptocurrency investments so Black men who make them know their money is safe.”\n\nWe have no idea how to make crypto a safe investment, and neither does anyone else: All experience shows crypto values to be insanely erratic, and the risk is inherently tied to the potential for big rewards.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that black men overwhelmingly want what everyone else does: a strong economy that lets them find jobs with a good hope at rising wages, a lasting end to the inflation that’s slammed middle- and working-class Americans, a border that’s under control to protect our communities, etc. etc.\n\nAll issues where Donald Trump is killing Harris in the polls, and ample reason for her support among black men to be markedly down from what Democrats usually see.\n\n“The brothers,” as multimillionaire Barack Obama put it in his lecture demanding they get back in line, look to be thinking for themselves — and it’s hard to see how this pack of nonsense is going to change their minds.","summary":"We're not sure what the Harris-Walz campaign was thinking when it came up with Kamala Harris' “Opportunity Agenda for Black Men,\" but it sure is insulting as

He Loves Tariffs","text":"Former President Donald Trump waxed poetic about his love of tariffs again on Friday — including his love for the word itself.Speaking at a roundtable with voters in Auburn Hills, Michigan, the Republican presidential nominee said he thinks \"tariff\" is \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary.\"\"You have other words that are damn nice, like 'love,'\" Trump said, while others in the room laughed. \"But I tell you, I think it's more beautiful than 'love.'\"Trump, who calls himself \"Tariff Man,\" frequently touts his plan to impose steep tariffs on all imports if he's elected president again.He initially proposed a 10 percent tariff on American trading partners but suggested this week that that number could go as high as 50 percent. He also proposed a 60 percent tariff on imports from China. A Newsweek report found that such a proposal could hit his own businesses since his companies manufacture some products, such clothing accessories, in China, Vietnam and Bangladesh.\"If I'm going to be president of this country, I'm going to put a 100, 200, 2,000 percent tariff,\" Trump said while speaking at the Economic Club of Chicago on Tuesday. \"They're not going to sell one car in the United States,\" he added, referring to Mexico.\"Tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented,\" he said last month in Flint, Michigan.Economic analysts and experts aren't so sure that's the case.The Washington Post published a lengthy report this week detailing how, if implemented, Trump's tariff plan could be disastrous for the U.S. economy, with American consumers bearing the brunt of the cost. It could also lead to greater uncertainty in the stock market, and spark conflicts between the U.S. and other countries.\"We are talking about a plan of historic significance,\" Douglas A. Irwin, an economist at Dartmouth College, told The Post. \"It would be enormous, and the blowback would be even more enormous.\"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also warned that imposing \"sweeping, un-targeted tariffs\" would be a \"deeply misguided\" move that would negatively affect American businesses and ratchet up inflation.\"We cannot even hope to advance our economic and security interests — such as opposing Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine — if we go it alone,\" Yellen said, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.Vice President Kamala Harris has also ripped Trump's tariff proposal, calling it a \"Trump sales tax.\"But the Democratic nominee has to walk a fine line with the issue to avoid alienating swing-state voters whose support she needs to win the November election. According to a Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll published last month, a majority of likely voters in swing states either strongly or somewhat support a 10 percent tariff on all imports.Trump and Harris both stumped in Michigan on Friday as they seek to consolidate support in battleground states ahead of the election. Harris held a rally in the afternoon and addressed union auto workers after, and she'll head to Detroit for a second rally in the evening. Trump will also hold his own rally in Detroit this evening.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump waxed poetic about his love for tariffs — including his love for the word itself.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-cant-stop-talking-about-tariffs-michigan-roundtable-1971565","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2499310/trump-michigan-roundtable.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-18 23:18:53","author":"Sonam Sheth","authors":["Sonam Sheth"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.154},{"id":260256366,"title":"EU đồng thuận ban hành luật mới để đẩy nhanh trục xuất người nhập cư trái phép","text":"Ông Trump công bố 'chiến dịch Aurora' chống người nhập cư\n\n Cựu Tổng thống Mỹ Donald Trump ngày 11.10 tiếp tục có những tuyên bố cứng rắn về cam kết chống lại người nhập cư nếu đắc cử.\n\nLà người phản đối làn sóng nhập cư trái phép, ông Trump coi việc người di cư ồ ạt đến Mỹ như một cuộc \"xâm lược\".

Terry, who is on the presidential ballot in 12 states, paid for a gruesome political ad that the network was required to run under federal law. ABC issued a content warning for viewers before airing the ad during a live episode of “The View.” Terry’s political anti-abortion ad displayed graphic images of bloodied, dead fetuses and compared journalists to Nazis. \n\nAnd in his echo chamber—ahem—social media site, Truth Social, former President Donald Trump has been threatening all the networks, calling for CBS’ broadcast license to be revoked because Vice President Kamala Harris keeps making him look bad with facts. Earlier in the campaign cycle, he did the same thing to ABC and NBC/MSNBC. \n\nOn Thursday, Trump continued flailing, posting screenshots of a post on X and a link to the Fox News article that bolstered his theory of CBS’ “significant and intentional news distortion” made by a conservative law firm, the Center for American Rights, over Harris’ “Face the Nation” and “60 Minutes” appearances.\n\nThere is a pattern here—when networks do not bow to Trump’s falsehoods and tantrums, like a petulant toddler, he uses the only thing he knows—money—to try to litigate others into oblivion. Except, the law and the Constitution are on the side of the First Amendment. \n\nTrump tried it again on Friday morning. On “Fox & Friends,” Trump said after his appearance on the show, that he had another “big event” with right-wing media tycoon and Fox News network founder Rupert Murdoch. He said they would discuss keeping negative ads about Trump off of Fox’s airways in the lead-up to Election Day. \n\n“I’m going to tell him something very simple because I can’t talk to anybody else, but don’t put on negative commercials for 21 days,” he said. “Don’t put on the air. There are horrible people that come on and lie. I’m gonna say, Rupert, please do it this way, and then we’re gonna have a victory.”\n\nAnd then, naturally, there’s his recent comments from last Sunday with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo, where he said he’d use the “National Guard” on “the enemy from within.” Despite many Republicans trying to defend and explain his comments, it’s pretty hard to justify a U.S. president wanting to use the military against political opponents. \n\nAnd let’s not forget his strange, opaque remarks earlier this month, when he suggested he’d punish the New York Times. \n\n“The New York Times is one of the most dishonest of all,” Trump said to right-wing podcaster Ben Shapiro. “I watched this New York Times, and it’s a classic. Wait until you see what I’m going to do with them. You’re going to have so much fun.”\n\nThe ultraconservative second Trump administration blueprint, Project 2025, created by 140 of Trump’s allies and colleagues, details plans to defund PBS, NPR, and any other public broadcasting.\n\nTrump’s ongoing threats to media networks and calls by those like DeSantis to cease and desist what they don’t like and revoke licenses, only reiterate the GOP’s broader strategy of controlling narratives and silencing any voice that does not placate their lies.","summary":"When will the GOP learn that the media doesn’t exist to promote their draconian agenda—or any politician's agenda for that matter?\n\n\n\nA federal judge struck down Florida Gov.

Applications are due Nov. 1. \n\n— Also in Eucharistic news, California-based Napa Institute and the Hallow prayer app collaborated on an event earlier this week that featured a spectacular Eucharistic procession through Midtown Manhattan in New York City — photos and a story can be found here.\n\nWith those last two news items, maybe I’ll attempt a bit of late-night adoration after the kids are asleep tonight.

If he wins in November, Trump would be the oldest president in U.S. history to be elected, surpassing Biden's age on Inauguration Day in January 2021 by a couple of months.\"Trump is 78 and is seeking the presidency until he's 82,\" Silver wrote. \"That's way too old, given the demands of the job. Considering the long history of old presidents seeking to hold onto power when they were clearly diminished...we should probably just have a Constitutional amendment that says a president can't be older than 75 on Inauguration Day.\"After a rough debate performance in June against Trump, Biden, who turns 82 in November, faced pressure from within his own party to step aside as the Democratic nominee. Reports surfaced that the president had blamed the rough performance on his busy travel schedule in the weeks leading up to it, and some sources close to Biden claimed that he had signs of \"cognitive decline.\"Biden and his campaign rebuked such reports, but the president was eventually pushed out, making way for 59-year-old Vice President Kamala Harris to assume the Democratic nomination in late July.As Silver reported Friday, the frequency of media coverage about the candidates' ages has fallen significantly. In July, per Silver's tracking, the number of New York Times articles that mentioned \"age\" along with Biden's name peaked at 341 for the month. Similarly, the number of articles that mentioned \"age\" and Trump by the Times peaked at 273 during the same time frame. By mid-August, the frequency of such stories had dropped below 140 a month.Silver wrote that he believes there should be more focus on Trump's age and mental capacity but added that pressure should still be applied to Biden as well.\"He may not be a candidate for president anymore, but he's the leader of the free world in a dangerous time facing multiple simultaneous crises from Ukraine to the Middle East,\" he wrote. \"How effective is he at handling these or if something even worse happens?\"Trump has been under pressure in recent weeks to be more transparent about his medical records as Election Day draws near. Last Saturday, Harris' physician released a letter that the vice president maintains a healthy lifestyle and that her most recent physical in April was \"unremarkable.\"Harris' campaign released the report as a nudge to Trump who has been limited about what information he releases to the public regarding his health. A spokesperson for the former president's campaign said last week that medical reports Trump has voluntarily released have found that he is in \"perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief.\"Newsweek has reached out to Trump's campaign via email Friday for comment.Silver also said on Friday that he sees \"real movement\" toward the former president in recent polling data, although the race between Harris and Trump remains incredibly close.\"Harris's lead in national polls is down to 2.3 points from a peak of 3.5 on October 2,\" Silver wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Friday. \"The race remains a toss-up, but we're at a point where we can be pretty confident this is real movement and not statistical noise.\"According to Silver, Harris is leading Trump 49 percent to 46.7 percent on average across national polling as of Friday. But per the pollster's election model, Trump has a slightly higher chance (51.6 percent to 48.1 percent) of securing the necessary 270 Electoral votes for victory in November.","summary":"\"We should probably just have a Constitutional amendment that says a president can't be older than 75 on Inauguration Day,\" Silver wrote.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/nate-silver-explains-why-he-feels-trump-way-too-old-presidency-1971560","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2499301/silver-explains-why-trump-way-tooold.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-18 22:59:39","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":260255216,"title":"‘I’m With Elon’: Gavin Newsom Sides With Musk’s SpaceX in California Lawsuit","text":"California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he’s siding with Elon Musk and SpaceX after the rocket company sued a state commission this week, claiming its political bias against Musk blocked SpaceX from launching more rockets. \n\n“I’m with Elon,” Newsom said on Thursday night, according to Politico. “I didn’t like that.” \n\nNewsom made the comment while he was campaigning for fellow Democrat Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania. \n\nOn Tuesday, SpaceX’s lawsuit claimed the California Coastal Commission “engaged in naked political discrimination” during a recent debate on whether to allow SpaceX to increase rocket launches from 36 to 50 at Vandenberg Space Force Base. The lawsuit, as obtained by TheWrap, said commissioners overstepped their limits by considering Musk’s political leanings — violating his First Amendment right to free speech in the process.\n\n“The concern is with SpaceX increasing its launches, not with the other companies increasing their launches,” commissioner Caryl Hart said, according to the lawsuit. “We’re dealing with a company … the head of which has aggressively injected himself into the president race and made it clear what his point of view is.”\n\nOthers on the committee agreed with Hart’s sentiment, SpaceX’s lawsuit noted. The lawsuit quoted commissioner Gretchen Newsom, saying Musk hops around the U.S. “spewing and tweeting political falsehoods.”\n\nGov. Newsom on Thursday said he wasn’t a fan of Musk’s politics being mentioned when considering rocket launches. \n\n“Look, I’m not helping the legal case,” Newsom said. “You can’t bring up that explicit level of politics.”\n\nNewsom — who appointed some of the commission’s members — “broadly agreed” with SpaceX’s lawsuit, according to Politico. \n\n“These are friends of mine that said that,” Newsom said. “These are good commissioners. But you got to call balls and strikes. And trust me, I’m not big on the Elon Musk bandwagon right now. So that’s me calling balls and strikes.”\n\nMusk, for his part, has made it clear he isn’t on the Newsom Bandwagon. The Tesla head honcho, in an appearance on Tucker Carlson’s show last week, reiterated that he isn’t a fan of Newsom’s progressive views, calling the governor the “goddamn Joker.”\n\nEarlier this year, Musk said he was moving X and SpaceX’s headquarters from California to Texas. Musk said the “final straw” was when Gov. Newsom signed a bill barring teachers from notifying parents that their kids identified as transgender.\n\nAt the same time, Musk has been perhaps Donald Trump’s biggest supporter in recent months. He publicly endorsed the former president after the July assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. Since then, Musk’s posted on X — the app he owns — in favor of Trump, hosted a live conversation with him on X Spaces in August and joined the candidate on stage when he returned to Butler earlier this month.\n\nBeyond that, Musk has also put a lot of money into helping Trump get back into the White House. On Tuesday, Musk reported $75 million in contributions to America PAC, his pro-Trump political action committee. America PAC’s website, which includes a picture of Musk in his “dark MAGA” hat, lists a handful of top priorities, including free speech, safe cities and secure borders. \n\nSpaceX’s lawsuit, on top of saying the commission has violated Musk’s free speech rights, said the commission had interfered with national security operations.\n\n“Rarely has a government agency made so clear that it was exceeding its authorized mandate to punish a company for the political views and statements of its largest shareholder and CEO,” the lawsuit said.","summary":"The Golden State governor says the X owner's politics shouldn't be a factor in whether he gets to launch more rockets \n\n\nThe post &#8216;I&#8217;m With Elon&#8217;: Gavin Newsom Sides With Musk&#8217;s SpaceX in California Lawsuit appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/gavin-newsom-elon-musk-lawsuit-spacex-california/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gavin-newsom-GettyImages-1340327673.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-18 22:57:17","author":"Sean Burch","authors":["Sean Burch"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":260254662,"title":"Barack and Michelle Obama to join Kamala Harris on the campaign tour next week as election race tightens","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris is bringing out the Democrat heavy-hitters as her campaign sees a slip in the polls. \n\nThe VP will campaign alongside both former President Obama and First Lady Michelle next week as the presidential race is in the dead heat for the final stretch. \n\nFirst Harris will be joined by the former president for a rally in Georgia on Thursday, October 24. It will be their first campaign event together with Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nThen on Saturday, October 26, the former first lady will appear with the vice president at a rally in Michigan. \n\nThe blockbuster rally next Saturday will be the former first lady’s first in-person campaign event with Harris as well as her first time on the trail in 2024.\n\nOctober 26 marks the first day of early voting in Michigan. The vice president and former first lady will try to mobilize voters to cast their ballots early in the battleground state where polls show a tight race. \n\nMeanwhile, early voting in Georgia smashed records when it kicked off earlier this week. More than 600,000 people have already cast ballots in the 2024 election there. \n\nAt their event, Obama and Harris will encourage Georgia voters to go vote ahead of Election Day on November 5. \n\nHarris will also be in the state for the first time since early in-person voting began for a rally on Saturday in Atlanta.\n\nThe former president first hit the campaign trail for Harris with a solo event in Pittsburgh earlier this month, but their get-out-the-vote event next week will be their first campaign appearance together. \n\nBoth the blockbuster joint events with the former president and first lady are seen as a massive opportunity to harness voter enthusiasm ahead of Election Day, according to a senior campaign official given anonymity to discuss the sensitive unannounced campaign activity. \n\nThe Obamas remain perhaps the most beloved leaders in the Democratic party. Some voters had even hoped Michelle would run for president before she ruled it out earlier this year.\n\nWhile next week will be the first time the former first lady appears on the campaign trail in 2024, her speech at the Democratic National Convention in August stole the show overshadowing even her husband’s address.\n\nHer scathing take down of Donald Trump received thunderous applause from Democrats and reverberated across the internet.\n\nBefore she took the stage, it was not clear the former first lady would even make a showing in Chicago. The last time she was there was to memorialize her late mother.\n\nThe politics-adverse former first lady even acknowledged she was not sure she was up for the task during her speech, but she said she felt compelled to show up and honor her mom’s memory.\n\nWith that she delivered a powerful and heartfelt pitch for the vice president. \n\n‘My girl, Kamala Harris, is more than ready for this moment. She is one of the most qualified people ever to seek the office of the presidency,’ she said in her remarks.\n\nShe also told supporters ‘let us work like our lives depend on it.’\n\nSince her show-stopping speech, Obama has publicly encouraged people to register to vote across her social media platforms through When We All Vote.\n\nShe will headline a separate get-out-the-vote rally with the organization in Atlanta on October 29. \n\nMeanwhile, the former first lady has also offered high praise for the vice president online including after the September presidential debate when she wrote in a post Harris is the ‘only candidate in this race who is ready to be President.’\n\nDuring the pandemic in 2020, Obama did not hit the campaign for Biden, but she did deliver a video closing argument for him that October. In 2016, she campaigned both solo as well as with Hillary Clinton in person in the final stage of the campaign season.\n\nAhead of her first campaign appearance with Harris, the former first lady has been keeping busy working with a number of organizations and projects as well as criss-crossing the country promoting her latest book. \n\nFormer President Obama has been much more active in the 2024 election season to date. \n\nHe has been helping raise millions for the presidential race as well as Democrats down ballot with event appearances as well as in ads.\n\nAt his first solo 2024 campaign event in Pittsburgh last week, Obama delivered a blistering attack on Trump where he slammed him for ‘ranting and the raving about crazy conspiracy theories.’ \n\nHe also questioned ‘if Donald Trump does not care that a mob might attack his own vice president, do you think he cares about you?’ \n\nThe former president has several additional solo campaign stops in the coming days including in Arizona on Friday and Nevada on Saturday. \n\nNext week, he heads to Michigan and Wisconsin to campaign on Tuesday before joining the vice president in person for the first time in Georgia.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris is bringing out the Democrat heavy-hitters as her campaign sees&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/barack-and-michelle-obama-to-join-kamala-harris-on-the-campaign-tour-next-week-as-election-race-tightens/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Barack-and-Michelle-Obama-to-hit-the-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-18 22:55:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.017},{"id":260254674,"title":"How Libertarian Chase Oliver May Impact Trump, Harris Race in Swing States","text":"Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver could tip the scales in the tight 2024 presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump by drawing votes in battleground states with razor-thin margins.Oliver, who is on the ballot in 47 states and a registered write-in in three, is polling around 1 percent, which could be influential this election given the extremely narrow margins between Harris and Trump. However, it is important to note that it's unclear whether all Oliver voters would have otherwise backed Harris, Trump, or opted not to vote at all.A Pew Research Center survey of 5,110 adults, conducted between September 30 and October 6, found Harris narrowly leading Trump, 48 percent to 47 percent, with third-party candidates garnering 5 percent of the vote.When forced to choose between Harris and Trump, respondents' initially supporting third-party candidates are split: 36 percent favor Harris, 35 percent back Trump, and about 30 percent decline to answer. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.7 percentage points. Other national polls, show a smaller margin for third-party candidates.Third-party candidates have been called out by Republicans and Democrats over the years for swaying the election by voting for candidates who will not win. To this, Oliver told Newsweek in an email on Friday, \"To those in one party or the other who see us as spoilers, I say, the two-party system itself is spoiled rotten. But we welcome being a disruptor to the political binary.\"Newsweek has reached out to Harris' and Trump's campaign for comment via email on Friday.Oliver, 39, is the youngest candidate in the race, having told Newsweek in an exclusive interview this June, \"It's time for our generation to really rise up.\"Here's how Oliver is faring in key swing state races, and what that could mean for Harris and Trump.ArizonaA New York Times/Siena College poll of 808 likely voters in Arizona found Trump leading Harris, but both dropping their share of the vote when third-party candidates like Oliver are included.The poll, conducted between October 7 and 10, shows Trump with 51 percent of the vote, compared to Harris' 46 percent. However, with third-party candidates factored in, Trump lowers to 50 percent and Harris to 45 percent, while Oliver captures less than 1 percent, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein takes 1 percent. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.GeorgiaA Georgia native, Oliver voted for himself in the Peach State earlier this week. Recent polls show he is garnering around 1 percent support in his home state.A Quinnipiac University poll of 1,328 likely voters conducted from October 10 to October 14 found Trump with a 7-point lead in the state, and Oliver and Stein each garnering 1 percent. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points.Oliver previously ran for Georgia's U.S. Senate seat in 2022, earning 2.1 percent of the vote, which forced a runoff between Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker, as neither secured a majority. Warnock went on to win the December runoff with 51 percent of the vote, while Walker received 48.6 percent.MichiganOliver appears to maintain his 1 percent in Michigan, too. A Quinnipiac University poll of 1,007 likely Michigan voters shows Trump leading with 50 percent and Harris with 47 percent, while Oliver garners 1 percent support. With a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, Oliver's support could prove influential in the state.NevadaOliver performs below his average among Nevadan voters, with a New York Times/ Siena College poll of 677 registered voters surveyed between August 12 and 15, finding his support at less than 1 percent. That same poll found Trump leading Harris by 3 percentage points, 45 percent to 42 percent, which is within the poll's margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.North CarolinaIn North Carolina, Oliver garners 1 percent of support. A Quinnipiac University poll of 1,031 likely voters conducted from October 10 to 14, found Oliver with 1 percent support, Harris at 49 percent, and Trump at 47 percent. In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between Harris and Trump, Harris' lead widened to 50 percent over Trump's 47 percent.This could mean that Oliver's supporters in North Carolina may lean slightly toward Harris, though it's important to note that 1 percent were undecided, and another 1 percent refused to answer, leaving the result inconclusive. The poll has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.PennsylvaniaThe Keystone State is pivotal in the presidential race, as the winner of Pennsylvania and its 19 Electoral votes—more than any other swing state—could determine the outcome of the 2024 election.Oliver is on the ballot in the state, telling Newsweek in an email on Friday, \"We are happy to provide Pennsylvania voters an option outside of a two-party system that more and more ignores individual liberty.\"A New York Times/Philadelphia Inquirer/Siena College poll of 857 likely voters in the state found Harris leading Trump, but both dropping their share of the vote when third-party candidates like Oliver are included.The poll, conducted between October 7 and 10, shows Harris with 50 percent of the vote, compared to Trump's 47 percent. However, with third-party candidates factored in, Harris drops to 49 percent and Trump to 45 percent, while Oliver captures less than 1 percent, and Stein takes 1 percent. Harris' lead is within the margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.A recent Quinnipiac University poll conducted from October 3 to 7, among 1,412 likely voters found Stein and Oliver each receiving 1 percent of the vote in Pennsylvania, with Harris 49 percent and Trump 46 percent.In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between only the Democratic and Republican nominees, Harris maintained 49 percent support, while Trump edged closer with 47 percent, suggesting that more third-party candidates may be supporting Trump in the state.Among independents, who make up 23 percent of respondents, 43 percent support Harris, while 47 percent back Trump, and 3 percent support third-party candidates, according to the poll. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 2.6 percentage points.WisconsinA Quinnipiac University poll of 1,073 likely voters in the state, conducted between October 3 and 7, found Trump leading Harris, 48 to 46 percent, with Stein and Oliver each securing 1 percent support.The margin between the Republican and Democratic nominees stays the same if third-party candidates are excluded, with Trump receiving 49 percent of the vote and Harris 47 percent. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.Another poll found similar results. A Marquette Law School poll of 882 registered voters conducted between September 18 and 26, found Oliver receiving 1 percent of the vote, and Harris leading by 4 percentage points, 48 percent to Trump's 44 percent.

Make a plan,\" Harris urged supporters at a rally in Grand Rapids, the first of her three stops here Friday. \"Michigan, today I ask you…..are you ready to make your voices heard?\" And she emphasized to the crowd that \"we've got to energize and organize and mobilize and remind our neighbors and our friends that their vote is their voice.\" However, the Democratic presidential nominee didn't have Michigan to herself on Friday with under three weeks to go until Election Day. CRUNCH TIME: KAMALA HARRIS TO TEAM UP WITH THE OBAMAS NEXT WEEK Former President Trump, the Republican standard-bearer, is also in Michigan. Trump's first stop: a campaign office in Hamtramck, the only Muslim-majority city in the U.S. Hamtramck Democratic Mayor Amer Ghalib, the first Arab American and first Muslim to lead the city, attended the event. Ghalib made headlines a month ago by endorsing Trump, even though three city council members in the same city have endorsed Harris. WATCH DONALD TRUMP'S INTERVIEW ON ‘FOX AND FRIENDS' \"Frankly, it's an honor,\" Trump said if the mayor's endorsement, as he took questions from reporters upon arrival in Michigan. Both Trump and Harris are courting the state's consequential Arab American voters, who make up over two percent of Michigan's population, the highest percentage of any state in the nation. The Trump campaign this year has seen an opening among Arab Americans, over their anger at the current administration's support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza. \"I don't think they're going to be voting for her [Harris],\" Trump argued. And pointing to the latest polls in the state, he touted \"I hear we're leading in Michigan.\" CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2024 ELECTION Many of the latest public opinion surveys in the swing state do indicate Trump with a very slight edge over Harris in a margin-of-error race. Matt Grossman, a Michigan State University political science professor, spotlighted the state's \"unique dynamics\" as he pointed to Harris' perceived \"weakness\" with Arab American voters as well as the state's sizable Black electorate. Michigan is one of seven crucial swing states whose razor-thin margins decided President Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump. And all seven states are likely to determine if Harris or Trump wins November's election to succeed Biden in the White House. Michigan, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, are the three Rust Belt states that make up the Democrats' so-called \"Blue Wall.\" The party reliably won all three states for a quarter-century before Trump narrowly captured them in the 2016 election to win the White House.

Harris, who in July replaced Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket, and Trump — as well as their running mates — have made numerous stops in the Blue Wall states this summer and autumn, and both campaigns and allied groups have built up get-out-the Rust Belt battlegrounds. And on Friday evening, both Harris and Trump were scheduled to be campaigning in and around Detroit.

Another 740,000 early voters are not with either party. \n\nIt also breaks down to more than 4.4 million women who have already voted compared to more than 3.7 million men.\n\nThe data comes as Democrats have been more likely to cast ballots early or by mail in the past, and former President Donald Trump has previously criticized the process.\n\nHowever, in this campaign, Republican party officials have been pushing GOP voters to cast ballots in any way they can, including taking advantage of early voting options. \n\nDemocrats are currently outpacing Republicans when it comes to early and absentee voting in the seven key battleground states that will likely decide the election. \n\nMore than 2.6 million ballots have been cast in the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. \n\nOf those, more than 1.4 million were cast by Democrats while just over 964,000 were cast by Republicans.

Harris spoke at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Friday, and took questions from the media afterward. NBC News correspondent Peter Alexander pressed Harris on her campaign's struggle with male voters before asking her about policy differences between herself and Biden. \"What is one policy that you would've done differently, over these last three-and-a-half years than President Biden?\" he asked. Harris responded, \"To be very candid with you, including Mike Pence, vice presidents are not critical of their presidents. I think that really, actually, in terms of the tradition of it and also just going forward, it does not make for a productive and important relationship.\" KAMALA HARRIS TELLS ‘THE VIEW’ SHE CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING SHE WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY FROM BIDEN Alexander followed up with, \"He's now given you that green light with his comments that you can carve your own path,\" referencing comments Biden made this week. Harris began to answer that \"going forward, there's no question\" she brings \"her own life experiences\" to the presidency. \"Is there a policy that stands out to you in particular?\" he pressed. Harris said she would push for Medicare to cover home health care, make housing more affordable for first-time home buyers and help small businesses. \"My approach to what we need to around Medicare covering home health care, born out of my experience of taking care of my mother. My priority on housing, one, because I know what it means; affordable housing and the ability to buy a home. Again, my own experience. My mother saved up, and not until I was a teenager was she able to do it, and I know for so many young people who I speak with around our country, the American dream is just really out of reach. So my policy about $25,000 down payment assistance to help them get their foot in the door. The work that I have been doing and will bring to the presidency around emphasizing small businesses as being part of the real backbone of America's economy,\" she said about the changes she'd make \"moving forward.\" BIDEN SAYS HARRIS HANDLED 'EVERYTHING FROM FOREIGN POLICY TO DOMESTIC POLICY' UNDER HIS ADMINISTRATION After the interview aired on MSNBC, host Katy Tur remarked to her panel that Harris \"seems like she struggles to answer that\" question and \"has not been very clear\" when asked how her presidency would differ from Biden's. Alexander said he's heard from \"several\" undecided voters on the campaign trail that they want to hear how Harris will be different from Biden. \"Clearly she doesn't want to talk about the last three-and-a-half years, she wants to talk about the future, as has been a campaign theme. But I do think that leaves some unanswered questions for some voters,\" Alexander remarked. During the same interview with Alexander on Friday, Harris also gave a word salad answer when asked what \"generation change means to [her].\" \"I think it's about a state of mind, and it is about understanding that we should be focused on this moment and this is a very particular moment where there is a lot happening in our country that is about innovation, that are really new approaches to longstanding challenges and it's a new generation of thinking as much as anything else,\" she responded. Harris has frequently dodged questions about how she would run the country differently from Biden. On \"The View\" last week, Harris said, \"There is not a thing that comes to mind\" that she would do differently from Biden and she dodged the question again on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\" During an interview with Fox News’ host Bret Baier on Wednesday, Harris declared her presidency would not be a continuation of the current administration but didn't give specifics.

Trump has maintained strong polling numbers for two consecutive weeks, benefiting from favorable trends.With Election Day rapidly approaching, both campaigns are working to win over the remaining undecided voters in crucial battleground states, where polling data shows an exceptionally tight race.This week, the campaigns employed distinct strategies to sway these voters. Harris' team ramped up its media presence, investing heavily in digital and TV ads in key battlegrounds, appearing on Charlamagne tha God's podcast to court Black voters, and securing a rare solo interview with Fox News' Bret Baier.The vice president concluded the week campaigning in Michigan, making stops in Grand Rapids before hosting events in Lansing and Oakland County, near Detroit.Meanwhile, Trump had a media blitz, participating in interviews with friendly media outlets while avoiding less favorable ones. This week, he attended a pre-taped women-only town hall with Fox host Harris Faulkner, followed by a Hispanic town hall with Univision.On Thursday, he had a sit-down with Fox & Friends co-host Lawrence Jones at a Bronx barber shop, met with the Wall Street Journal editorial board, and gave a video interview with George \"Tyrus\" Murdoch for OutKick. He also spoke at the Al Smith charity dinner.On Friday, he appeared on Fox & Friends, joined The Dan Bongino Show, and taped an interview with wrestler Mark Calaway before heading to Michigan.Emerson College Poll (October 14-16)A new poll by Emerson College, conducted from October 14 to 16 among 1,000 likely voters, shows the race is in a dead heat. Harris holds a slim lead with 50 percent of the vote, while Trump follows closely with 49 percent. This near-even split reflects a highly polarized electorate, with both candidates working to win over undecided voters in the critical final weeks.Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll (October 8-14)A poll from Fairleigh Dickinson University, conducted from October 8 to 14 with 755 likely voters, shows Harris leading by 3 points, with 50 percent support compared to Trump's 47 percent. While Harris maintains a steady lead, the poll highlights Trump's resilience in retaining his core supporters. In this poll, the simple sampling error for 806 registered voters is +/-3.5 percentage points.Fox News Poll (October 11-14)In contrast, a Fox News poll conducted by Beacon Research/Shaw & Company Research from October 11 to 14 among 870 likely voters shows Trump leading by 2 points, with 50 percent support compared to Harris's 48 percent. This represents a notable shift toward Trump, reflecting growing momentum in key regions. The gains suggest that Trump's campaign efforts in swing states may be proving effective as he narrows the gap with Harris. This poll has a margin of sampling error of +/- 3 percentage points.The Trump momentumOn Friday, Nate Silver's popular forecast confirmed the momentum shifting toward Trump, noting that his chances of winning are at their highest since August. The updated model reflected several strong polling numbers in Trump's favor in crucial swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.Silver's latest projections show Trump holding a slight edge in the Electoral College, with a 50.2 percent chance of winning, compared to Harris' 49.5 percent — despite Harris having a 75 percent chance of winning the popular vote.While FiveThirtyEight's simulations also favor Trump, the model gives him a 52 out of 100 chance of winning, compared to Harris's 48 out of 100.","summary":"Donald Trump has sustained strong polling numbers for two consecutive weeks, buoyed by favorable surveys.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-harris-odds-winning-every-recent-major-poll-17-days-left-1971531","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2499269/donald-trump-kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-18 22:16:58","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.048},{"id":260252594,"title":"Not even ‘Fox and Friends’ can hide Trump’s dementia","text":"Some of Donald Trump’s highly visible supporters seem concerned that their man is losing his mind and everyone can see it.\n\nThe former president was scheduled for an early-morning interview today, a regular thing for a presidential candidate.

Fact is, Trump’s state of mind has deteriorated dramatically since the start of the week, when he swayed and bopped on stage to music for 39 minutes, as if he’d temporarily forgotten that he was campaigning for president. \n\nThat’s when you hype even harder. \n\nDude is out-working people half his age!\n\nUnfortunately, for his rightwing supporters, the “Fox and Friends” interview didn’t go well. Like other media he did this week, it badly exposed what I’m calling his deepening descent into dementia. \n\nAaron Rupar posted the whole thing, but here’s what stood out:\n\nHe revealed without meaning to that “a couple of people at Fox” wrote some of the “jokes” he told at last night’s Al Smith Dinner.He failed to pick up on a cue from a co-host. He was supposed to say that he’d love to have Nikki Haley stump for him in the hopes of winning over Republicans who voted for her in the GOP primary. Instead, he talked about how “badly he beat her.”He gave up trying to keep track of the conversation when he started talking about “the old days.” Back then, he said, there were “no negative ads” on Fox. I think he meant ads promoting his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris, but I’m not sure. I’m not sure anyone else on “the curvy couch” was sure either.Co-host Brian Kilmeade seemed to realize Trump was losing his mind on live TV, so he scrambled to cover up for him by bringing up “the weave.” In reality, the weave is when Trump flits from one thing to another, without any apparent reason for doing so. By referring to his dementia as “the weave,” Kilmeade tried making a mental disability look like a clever rhetorical device.\n\nThe weirdest moment was when he responded to a child’s question about his favorite farm animal. Trump said he loves cows. But, he added, “if we go with Kamala, we won’t have any cows anymore.” \n\nThis was met with laughter, but his face seemed to register confusion, as if to ask: why are these people laughing? So he said it again, seeming to ensure that they knew he wasn’t joking. “According to Kamala, who’s a radical-left lunatic, we won't have any cows anymore.” \n\nThere was less laughing the second time.\n\nIt was so bad that one of his maga-bros felt the urge to cheerlead even louder than usual. Trump was “sharp, tactful, encouraging, presidential,” with special stress on “sharp” and “encouraging,” as if his conspicuous mental deterioration threatens to dampen enthusiasm. \n\nHis campaign seems to understand what a conservative pundit said recently – “the more Trump speaks, the more Americans are reminded of his deficiencies as a candidate, both in character and coherence.” So his staff has canceled previously planned appearances with “60 Minutes,” CNBC, NBC and smaller media outlets. Trump won’t do a second debate with Harris. His campaign pulled out of an NRA rally. \n\nThis morning, Politicocited two people familiar with conversations between the Trump campaign and The Shade Room, a podcast popular with young, Black professionals. Harris made an appearance there recently. Talks fell apart, however, according to Politico. “A Trump adviser told The Shade Room producers that Trump was ‘exhausted and refusing [some] interviews but that could change’ at any time.”\n\n“Exhaustion” is probably the most common euphemism for mental health issues used by celebrities and other highly visible people. In Trump’s case, the issue is pretty clearly some form of dementia. The condition runs in his family. His dad died of Alzheimer’s. Trump often says he “aced” two cognitive tests, but he’s known to have dictated his medical reports to his doctors when he was president. Harris released her health records before blasting Trump for not releasing his. \n\nIndeed, the Harris campaign has bird-dogged the topic of Trump’s mental decline for weeks. On Tuesday, spokesman Ian Sams told CNN: “I’m not entirely sure what [the weave] is besides rambling and meandering. So it does raise the real question of ‘are you fit for the job? Are you up to the task?’ This is a very serious moment in a very serious time for our country. And you think about the decisions that a president has to make. Are you physically capable of doing it?”\n\nTrump’s campaign denies he’s “exhausted.” A spokesperson told Politico that he’s “running laps around” Harris. Even so, his staff is clearly concerned about voters viewing Trump in the same way that they viewed Joe Biden after the June debate between them. His people are trying to minimize his exposure by restricting him to friendly media.\n\nBut Trump still has to perform well, no matter how friendly the media. As today’s “Fox and Friends” segment showed, he can’t do even that.","summary":"Some of Donald Trump’s highly visible supporters seem concerned that their man is losing his mind and everyone can see it.\n\nThe former president was scheduled for an early-morning interview today, a regular thing for a presidential candidate.

He would host the event again next year.Trump would then be seen as an attendee at multiple events, but his most significant contribution came during WrestleMania 23 and the Battle of the Billionaires.Then-WWE CEO Vince McMahon challenged Trump to a \"hair vs. hair\" match, meaning the loser would have to shave their head.

But she appeared to touch a nerve with her Republican rival when she mentioned a report that Trump was “exhausted”.\n“Being president of the United States is probably one of the hardest jobs in the world and we really do need to ask, if he’s exhausted on the campaign trail, is he fit to do the job?” jabbed Harris, who has been on the road campaigning since Monday and will not return to Washington until sometime next week.\nHarris’ attack comes as she seeks to raise doubts about Trump’s health over the final days of the campaign.\nTrump, at 78, would be the oldest person in US to become the president if he wins.

She doesn’t go to any events,” Trump charged hours before a rally in Detroit as he ticked down his to-do list for the day. He said he was on Fox & Friends at 7am, had two other appearances and then made “about 15 phone calls.”\n“I’ve gone 48 days now without a rest. And I’ve got that loser, who doesn’t have the energy of a rabbit,” Trump said.\n“Tell me when you’ve seen me take even a little bit of a rest. Not only am I not – I’m not even tired. I’m really exhilarated.”\nQuestions about Trump’s energy level come as he has backed out of some interviews with mainstream media outlets, including 60 Minutes and CNBC.\nPolitico reported that a Trump aide had told producers at a website negotiating an interview that the ex-president was “exhausted” and refusing some appearances – a claim described by his campaign as “detached from reality”.\n\nTrump still appears regularly on friendly cable shows and conservative podcasts – often sitting for hours of interviews each day.\nOn Friday, he spent 40 minutes on set with the hosts of Fox & Friends before he joined The Dan Bongino Show, a video podcast, and taped an interview with Mark Calaway, the wrestler famously known as “The Undertaker”, for his Six Feet Under podcast.\nHe also attended an editorial meeting with Fox News and the New York Post before he departed for a multi-stop trip to Michigan.\nStill, leading Democrats, including top Harris campaign adviser David Plouffe, continue to raise questions about Trump’s energy levels.\n“This is important,” Plouffe said on CNN.\n“I’ve worked in the White House. It’s the hardest job in the world, and I think it raises real questions.

The wage discrimination bill, which allows employees more time to file a claim, is named after Lilly Ledbetter, a retired worker at a Goodyear factory in Alabama who discovered she was paid less than her male counterparts. AFP PHOTO / Saul LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nOn Saturday, groundbreaking pay equity advocate Lilly Ledbetter passed away at the age of 86. Ledbetter never set out to be an activist—she was a factory worker in Alabama who just wanted to do her job and get paid fairly for doing it. But after an anonymous note informed Ledbetter that she was being paid significantly less than all 15 of her male colleagues, including those with less seniority, Ledbetter set out on a path that would ultimately lead to a change in American law.\n\n“It’s important to remember that she was a manager in a tire plant in Alabama in the 80s. She was a force in the workplace, a woman ahead of her time,” Noreen Farrell, the executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, told me in an interview this week. While it’s hard to calculate the exact number of people who’ve benefited from the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act—which President Obama signed in his first act as commander in chief in 2009—Farrell says that Ledbetter’s work touches tens of thousands of pay discrimination cases every year.\n\nHowever, as entrepreneur LIz Elting notes in her remembrance of Ledbetter for ForbesWomen, the future Ledbetter fought for may still be on uncertain ground, with recent research from the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) estimating that the gender pay gap may never close. “So many women, this writer included, have Ledbetter to thank for igniting this fight so that we can one day make that future a reality,” Elting says. “In her own words, ‘This fight, which began as my own, is now our fight.’”\n\nCheers to that!\n\nMaggie McGrath\n\nP.S.: Nominations for the 4th annual 50 Over 50 Global list are now open!

It’s sometimes used to excuse gender and pay disparities at the leadership level. But new research suggests that the opposite is true: in 2024, female business leaders are significantly more confident that they have the right skills to be successful at work than their male counterparts.\n\nThe Checklist\n\n1. Watch your language. Are the words you use on your resume holding you back? According to new research, “communal” verbiage that indicates relationship-oriented strengths can backfire for women who are applying for roles in traditionally male-dominated fields.\n\n2. “Dry trip” it. As many as 41% of Americans—and more than half of millennials and Gen Zers—are trying to drink less, a significant uptick from even just a few years ago. One area where this trend breaks down, though, is vacation. Meet the entrepreneur trying to bring more spirit-free options to the travel industry.\n\n3. Recover from a business-partner breakup. The emotional (and logistical) turmoil of losing a business partner can mirror the grief cycle we experience for personal losses.

J.D. Vance rallied in the Democratic stronghold of Pittsburgh Thursday, while Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz barnstormed in rural red Lawrence County Tuesday. \n\nThough neither event seemed to attract voters from the opposing camp, attendees believe the candidates’ Rust Belt and rural identities could make up for weakness at the top of the tickets in western Pennsylvania. \n\nWith polls showing Harris just 1 point ahead of Trump, Pennsylvania remains too close to call — and up for grabs.\n\nVance made a direct appeal to Steel City’s labor roots. \n\nIf his union Democrat grandparents were alive today, he said they’d see “the Democratic party of Kamala Harris has left them behind, and they are welcome in the Republican Party of Donald J. Trump,” as he boasted 65% of Pennsylvania Teamsters support Trump. \n\nCathy Collins, a Pittsburgh special-needs life coach, explained the Democratic drubbing. “The reason the union workers don’t go for them is they don’t have jobs,” she told The Post after the rally. She said her Democratic boilermaker friend is voting Republican for the first time because permitting restrictions have killed projects and jobs.\n\nBut the senator has other appeal too.\n\n“Vance covers a lot of ground. He’s a Yale graduate so he can connect with the intellect,” Scott Sigmund, a retired IT worker who moved to Pittsburgh from Tennessee, told The Post, suggesting Vance can speak the language of college-educated voters in the city known for its universities and hospitals.\n\nSteven Royer likes how the candidate deflects attacks and handles media interviews, citing Vance calling out ABC’s Martha Raddatz for downplaying the threat of migrant gangs.\n\n“That’s righteous,” Royer told The Post.\n\nCollins added Vance articulates Trump’s economic and border policies without the brashness.\n\n“He gives a behind the scenes of what Trump will be doing,” she said, calling him a new and improved Trump.\n\n“What Trump lacks, J.D. has.”\n\nThat applies to Vance’s humble origins: raised by his grandmother in Rust Belt Ohio because his mother was addicted to opioids. \n\n“To me, Vance is us. I can relate to him. I can’t really relate to Trump,” Sigmund said. “I never knew my father, was abused by my stepdad, enlisted right out of high school,” he explained. Vance joined the Marine Corps after graduating high school. \n\n“He’s the epitome of America.”\n\nCollins said Vance’s roots in rural Kentucky would also help him in the rural counties surrounding Pittsburgh such as Washington County.\n\n“You’re talking farm country, horse country. They had a hard time with drugs,” she said.\n\n“He’s a good old country boy,” said Phyllis Hader, a retired nurse from rural Westmoreland County to Pittsburgh’s east. “He didn’t grow up spoiled.”\n\nVance makes up where Trump’s style turns off conservative voters.\n\n“I’m not a big one for calling anybody names,” Collins said, saying that gives the left ammunition to attack Trump.\n\n“I love him, but he hurt himself,” Collins said, “If he had been more careful with what he said, he wouldn’t have so many problems.”\n\nThough Vance does not bring huge crowds, she said he tempers Trump. \n\n“J.D. is going to help the Republican Party overall,” she said. “We want Vance as president next time around.”\n\nWhile Vance went to the city this week, Walz went to red farm country in Volant to pick off those very voters Trump’s brash style has alienated.\n\n“They’re trying to appeal to rural voters,” said Corinne, a professor from nearby Harlansburg who withheld her last name to protect her job. \n\nWalz told the crowd of more than 100 about his upbringing driving tractors and shooting guns in small-town Nebraska. \n\n“He has values that could appeal to someone who doesn’t like Trump but doesn’t think there’s a good option,” Corinne said, referring to Harris.\n\nCorinne left the Republican Party and started voting for Democrats when Trump first ran in 2015, and her Republican parents still can’t vote for Trump.\n\n“They never liked him.

In the sixth report of an in-depth series, Shi Jiangtao reports on how the US election outcome could impact the future of Taiwan.\nWith the race for the White House deadlocked less than a month before the election, Beijing has continued to refrain from signalling a preference for Vice-President Kamala Harris or former president Donald Trump to be the next US leader, or any other election-related questions.\nBut regardless of who wins the election, diplomatic analysts agree that Taiwan will remain the biggest thorn in bilateral ties and one of the most dangerous flashpoints in a possible conflict between Washington and Beijing.\nThey warn of the risks of exacerbating cross-strait tensions amid heightened uncertainty in the next four years and a challenge for the next president to strike the right balance between deterrence and reassurance, which US President Joe Biden has skilfully navigated.\nWhile the Democratic and Republican nominees have sparred fiercely on almost everything from the economy, abortion, to climate and Ukraine, there has been a growing bipartisan consensus in Washington on the need to get tougher on China and bolster Taiwan’s defence capabilities.\nZhiqun Zhu, a professor of international relations and director of the China Institute at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, said Beijing may not have a preference for Harris or Trump, as far as Taiwan is concerned.\nTaiwan will remain the thorniest and most dangerous issue between the United States and China, no matter who occupies the White House next year\nZhiqun Zhu, Bucknell University\n“The two will bring about different types and levels of challenges for Beijing with their China and Taiwan policies,” he said. “Taiwan will remain the thorniest and most dangerous issue between the United States and China, no matter who occupies the White House next year.”\nBeijing regards Taiwan as part of China, to be reunited by force if necessary. The US, like most countries, does not recognise the island as independent, but is opposed to any attempt to reunify the island by force and has remained Taiwan’s staunchest backer and top arms supplier.\nThe security situation in the Taiwan Strait has continued to deteriorate this year, as Beijing has ramped up military, political and economic pressure against the island’s independence-leaning new leader, William Lai Ching-te, who took office in May.\nOn September 18, two days after Washington approved its 16th arms sale to Taiwan since Biden took office in 2021, Beijing unveiled fresh sanctions on nine US defence firms over their involvement in the US$228 million deal.\nOn the same day, citing Lai’s “stubborn adherence” to a pro-independence stance, Beijing also announced the removal of tariff exemptions on 34 imports from the island, including vegetables, fruit and seafood, on top of a similar measure in May targeting more than 130 Taiwanese goods.\nShi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Beijing-based Renmin University of China, said the deterioration in the cross-strait relations was worrying, especially considering signs of an accelerating arms race between China and the US towards a potential conflict.\n“It is clear the situation in the Taiwan Strait has become increasingly treacherous,” he said, despite some progress on the resumption of the military-to-military communication between Beijing and Washington since Biden met Chinese President Xi Jinping in San Francisco in November last year.\n“To prevent China from dominating the situation around Taiwan and to prevent China from achieving cross-strait reunification, the US, whether it was under Trump’s presidency or during Biden’s tenure, has made significant and extensive efforts to bolster military support for Taiwan and prepare for a war with China over Taiwan,” he said. “I doubt there will be any major shift under a Harris or Trump administration.\n“In this sense, on the Taiwan issue, there is simply not much difference between the two candidates, except that Trump may have much less predictability than Harris, which would obviously be more detrimental to the situation in the Taiwan Strait.”\nHarris, who had limited foreign policy experience before she became vice-president three years ago, has made relatively few public pronouncements on China so far.\nIn an interview with 60 Minutes on CBS earlier this month, Harris said the US “should not seek conflict”, but instead protect American business interests. She did not say whether the US would use military force to support Taiwan.\n“I’m not going to get into hypotheticals,” Harris said. “But listen, we need to make sure that we maintain a one-China policy, but that includes supporting Taiwan’s ability to defend itself, including what we need to do to ensure the freedom of the Taiwan Strait.”\nAccording to Sourabh Gupta, a senior policy specialist with the Institute for China-America Studies in Washington, the broad trend lines of a Harris presidency on Taiwan policy are likely to closely follow those of the Biden administration.\n“For the most part, the Biden team operated within the confines of the US one-China policy … and has been consistent in its messaging and practices since the November 2022 G20 summit in Bali,” he said.\nHe noted some “instability” in the interpretation of the one-China policy during the first 18 months of the administration, when Biden vowed four times to defend Taiwan in the event of an armed attack by mainland China.\n\nAlthough each time the White House was quick to clarify the US policy on Taiwan – known as “strategic ambiguity” – Chinese officials and many China watchers believed those “gaffes” underlined the Biden administration’s push towards strategic clarity on the Taiwan issue.\nIn the meantime, however, the Biden White House has repeatedly reassured Beijing at every presidential and senior-level meeting that the US does not support “Taiwan independence”, does not support “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan”, and does not seek to use the Taiwan question as a tool to contain China, according to Gupta.\n“I do not expect the Harris team to depart substantially from this stance,” he added.\nZhu also said Harris was likely to continue Biden’s approach towards Taiwan, such as providing weapons and military aid to Taiwan, “internationalising the Taiwan issue”, and opposing unilateral change of the status quo.\n“A Harris administration is unlikely to help improve cross-strait relations, and cross-strait relations will remain deadlocked and dangerous,” he said.\nBy contrast, the return of Trump and his isolationist approach to the White House would almost certainly introduce “a dose of uncertainty” into the Taiwan Strait situation, according to Zhu.\n“Trump probably does not care much about Taiwan from his transactional perspective, but he is likely to be surrounded by avid China hawks who may wish to see some crises in the Taiwan Strait as part of their ongoing efforts to counter China,” he said. “Trump’s approach to Taiwan and the situation in the Taiwan Strait all depends on to what extent Trump’s policy will be shaped by the hawks around him and in Congress.”\n\nDuring his first term, Trump adopted a confrontational approach on China that marked the end of America’s engagement policy towards Beijing since former president Richard Nixon, and strengthened diplomatic and military support for Taiwan.\nTrump has so far dodged the contentious question about whether Washington should defend Taiwan, claiming in an interview with Time magazine earlier this year that he would not want to “reveal my card” or “give away any negotiating abilities”.\nAlthough Trump showed in his first term that he wants to relinquish at least part of the US’ global leadership to focus on domestic affairs, he has also made it clear that opposition to China forms a key part of his foreign policy agenda, according to Benoit Hardy-Chartrand, an international affairs expert at Temple University Japan in Tokyo.\n“Given the interviews he has given and his speeches on the campaign trail, there’s no indication that a second Trump administration would be much different on that front,” he said.\nIn an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek in July, Trump said “Taiwan should pay us for defence” and complained that the island had taken “almost 100 per cent” of the semiconductor industry from the US.\nFurther, Trump’s “strong mercantilist grievances” against Taiwan could push America’s strategic ambiguity posture on Taiwan, a strategy not to explicitly spell out whether and to what extent, the US military will intervene in a war across the Taiwan Strait, to “one of strategic clarity”, Gupta added.\n\n“At minimum, Taiwan policy under a Trump administration will be more harshly anti-China than under a Harris administration. At worst, the bottom could fall out if the Trump team determinedly moves forward to significantly deepen its military-military ties with Taipei, such as via port calls, joint patrols, joint and combined exercises, or an enduring troop presence on the island that goes beyond the mere skeletal.”\nYun Sun, director of the China programme and co-director of the East Asia programme at the Stimson Centre in Washington, warned that Beijing may need to be on alert as both Harris and Trump were expected to lend strong support to Taiwan.\n“That is the consistency of US policy toward Taiwan. Neither is going to work in favour of China’s desired unification,” she said.\n“I am not worried about Harris’ lack of experience on this particular issue. US policy toward Taiwan has its internal validity, due course and congressional support. It is not a policy that can be significantly altered,” she said.\nTaiwan always poses greater risks for potential conflict than other issues such as North Korea or the South China Sea, given the sensitivity of the Taiwan issue and the current state of cross-strait relations, according to Sun.\nTakashi Hosoda, an assistant professor at the Institute of Intelligence Studies at the University of Defence in the Czech Republic, said that regardless of the outcome of the US election, tensions over Taiwan were unlikely to ease because of the intensifying US-China rivalry.\nAside from internal US political factors favouring a hardline approach towards China to secure American’s supremacy in an increasingly chaotic and uncertain world, Beijing and Washington had entered a vicious “competitive spiral” in the name of military deterrence, he said.\nSecurity in the Taiwan Strait will be at greater risk over the next four years compared to the past four\nTakashi Hosoda, defence expert\n“An increasing number of indications of the possibility of a Taiwan crisis within the US and its like-minded allies means … an increasing perception of the crisis for the US and her partners about the material balance against China becoming more China-dominant,” he said.\n“At the same time, there has been an increase in attempts by both the US and China to use the ‘sense of crisis’ to strengthen their defence posture further, sell arms, and influence the cognitive domain of the other.”\nCompared to Biden’s “measured and balanced” handling of the Taiwan issue, it would be hard for his successor to strike the right balance between deterrence and reassurance, considering Trump’s track record and Harris’ relative lack of experience on China, according to Gupta.\n“It is not a given that a Harris administration will be as successful or lucky,” he said, adding that much would depend on the extent of senior officials’ continuity within her team.\n“Besides, as a first-term president with light foreign and defence policy credentials, her disposition towards China – and especially during a Taiwan Strait flare-up – is likely to be harder-line than would ordinarily be the case, so as to cover her political flanks,” he said.\n“All said, security in the Taiwan Strait will be at greater risk over the next four years compared to the past four. And I haven’t even got to Donald Trump and many of his hardline and Sinophobic Republicans appointees.”\nShi, from the Renmin University, said that while it was worrisome to see extensive war preparations by both China and the US over a possible contingency for Taiwan, it was also important to remember that the cross-strait situation had been tumultuous over the years.\n“The situation in the Taiwan Strait has always been dangerous, so only God knows whether there will be a war there between China and the US,” he said.\nBut thanks to the long-simmering tensions, both Chinese and American militaries and their frontline troops had had plenty of experience in dealing with each other and preventing accidental conflicts, Shi said.\n“In addition, China and the US have markedly strengthened their efforts to prevent military conflicts in the past year.”","summary":"Security in the Taiwan Strait will be at ‘greater risk’ over next the 4 years, regardless of election outcome, expert says.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3282968/taiwan-will-remain-flashpoint-no-matter-who-wins-us-election-analysts","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/18/dbfdee4e-4565-49ae-a710-309235aed663_1372f671.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-18 22:00:13","author":"Shi Jiangtao","authors":["Shi Jiangtao"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.035},{"id":260254132,"title":"'I remember': Pop megastar reminds voters about Trump's many failures","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign released a new ad Friday aimed at Latino voters.
