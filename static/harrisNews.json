In a contentious exchange on Meet the Press Sunday, Kristen Welker pressed Cotton on whether or not Trump broke the law by making campaign content out of the pictures and videos taken there. Trump attended a wreath-laying ceremony honoring 13 service members who died withdrawing from Afghanistan in 2021. One of the soldiers, Marine Staff Sgt. Taylor Hoover, is buried in Section 60. Trump posed for photos with the Hoover family at his grave. Trump’s spokespeople have denied any wrongdoing, claiming they were given permission to film ahead of the visit. Cemetery and defense officials have denied this. Further adding to the chaos, a scuffle allegedly occurred between a member of the cemetery staff and Trump campaign staffers when the cemetery worker tried to stop Trump’s entourage from taking photos. In a statement earlier this week, the Trump campaign also denied the physical altercation took place. “13 brave Americans were killed in Afghanistan three years ago because of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's failure to plan for a withdrawal,” Cotton wrote in response last week on X. “Good for President Trump to honor the service and sacrifice of those fallen heroes and their loved ones.” “The scandal is not that Pres. Trump honored 13 brave Americans killed in Afghanistan,” he wrote in a later post. “The scandal is Biden and Kamala sent those heroes into a needlessly dangerous situation.” Doubling down on his comments Sunday on Fox News, Cotton told Welker: “He didn’t take campaign photos there. These families, Gold Star families, whose children died because of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s incompetence, invited him to the cemetery…They wanted President Trump there. They wanted to take those photos,” Cotton said. Welker then brought up Master Sergeant Andrew Marckesano, a fallen solider whose gravestone was visible in photos Trump took with the Hoovers. Following the controversy, Marckesano’s sister asked that the soldiers buried at Section 60 “are honored and respected accordingly.” When asked if the Marckesano’s wishes were honored, Cotton said: “No, Kristen, they honored the wishes of the 13 families whose children died at Abbey Gate. Those families wanted the photos. They told me yesterday that they specifically asked President Trump for the photos. Obviously, headstones at Arlington are close to each other. When you take a photo of your loved one then other headstones are going to be present as well.” Coincidentally, Cotton has a special tie to the sacred site. It’s where he served for 16 months in The Old Guard. Soldiers assigned to The Old Guard guard the Tomb of the Unknown Solider, another holy site in the cemetery, among other duties. In his 2019 book Sacred Duty, Cotton details his time at Arlington and gives his thoughts on conduct while visiting. “Although a sign welcomes visitors to ‘our nation’s most sacred shrine,’ no rules are posted. Yet visitors somehow understand a proper code of conduct,” Cotton wrote. Ironically, his tune has changed as he went to bat for the former president.","summary":"Anna Moneymaker/GettySenator Tom Cotton (R-AR) is defending Donald Trump’s decision to take photos with military families in a restricted area of Arlington National Cemetery called Section 60 yet again.\n\nIn a contentious exchange on Meet the Press Sunday, Kristen Welker pressed Cotton on whether or not Trump broke the law by making campaign content out of the pictures and videos taken there.\n\nTrump attended a wreath-laying ceremony honoring 13 service members who died withdrawing from Afghanistan in 2021.

This is the first time this term there have been two successive ties in Newspoll. Primary votes were 38% Coalition (down one), 32% Labor (steady), 12% Greens (steady), 7% One Nation (up one) and 11% for all Others (steady). Anthony Albanese’s net approval slumped five points to -13, with 54% dissatisfied (up three) and 41% satisfied (down two). This is Albanese’s worst net approval in Newspoll since November 2023, after the failure of the Voice referendum. The graph below shows Albanese’s net approval in Newspoll this term. The plus signs are Newspoll results and a smoothed line has been fitted. Peter Dutton’s net approval was down three points to -13, and this is the first time Albanese and Dutton have been equal on net approval in Newspoll since November 2023. Albanese led Dutton by 45–37 as better PM (46–39 previously). When asked about inflation if Dutton and the Coalition were in government, 24% said inflation would be lower than it is now, 18% higher, 41% about the same and 17% were undecided. While the government has had other problems in the past few weeks, I believe inflation is still its main problem with voters. Last week’s Morgan consumer confidence reading of 82.6 was the highest six-week average since February, but consumer confidence has been below 85 for a record 82 successive weeks. YouGov poll tied at 50–50 A national YouGov poll, conducted August 23–28 from a sample of 1,543, had a 50–50 tie, a one-point gain for the Coalition since the mid-July YouGov poll. Primary votes were 37% Coalition (down one), 32% Labor (up one), 13% Greens (steady), 8% One Nation (up one) and 10% for all Others (down one). It’s strange that the two-party vote improved for the Coalition despite the drop in the Coalition’s primary vote and gain for Labor. Rounding probably explains this. Albanese’s net approval was down one point to -11, with 52% dissatisfied and 41% satisfied. Dutton’s net approval was also down one to -5. Albanese led Dutton by 43–38 as preferred PM (45–37 in July). In a forced choice question, 67% of Australian voters would vote for Democrat Kamala Harris for US president, while 33% would vote for Republican Donald Trump. The only group voting for Trump was One Nation voters (80–20 for Trump). Essential poll: Labor gains to lead by 48–46 A national Essential poll, conducted August 21–25 from a sample of 1,129, gave Labor a 48–46 lead including undecided, after a 47–47 tie in the early August Essential poll. Primary votes were 33% Coalition (down one), 29% Labor (up one), 13% Greens (down one), 7% One Nation (steady), 1% UAP (steady), 11% for all Others (up two) and 6% undecided (steady). Despite Labor’s improvement on voting intentions, Albanese’s net approval dropped seven points since late July to -10, with 50% disapproving and 40% approving. This is Albanese’s worst rating in Essential this term. Dutton’s net approval was steady at +1. By 44–30, voters supported Dutton’s call to pause arrivals of Palestinian refugees. There was a 42–42 tie on whether immigration to Australia is generally positive or negative (46–34 positive in November 2023). While voters were narrowly positive on immigration’s impact on the economy (42–41), they were negative on its impact on jobs (51–35), the environment (43–24) and strongly negative on house prices (69–15). On the government’s response to the Israel-Gaza war, 32% said it was too supportive of Israel, 16% too harsh on Israel and 52% were satisfied. These figures are unchanged from June. On Israel’s military action in Gaza, 39% (up one since June) said Israel should permanently withdraw, 21% (steady) agree to a temporary ceasefire and 17% (up two) said Israel’s military action was justified. Redbridge and Morgan polls A national Redbridge poll, conducted from a sample of 2,000, gave Labor a 50.5–49.5 lead, a two-point gain for Labor since the mid-July Redbridge poll. Primary votes were 38% Coalition (down three) and 33% Labor (up one). No other primary votes or fieldwork dates have been released yet. A national Morgan poll, conducted August 19–25 from a sample of 1,701, gave the Coalition a 50.5–49.5 lead, a one-point gain for the Coalition since the August 12–18 Morgan poll. Primary votes were 39.5% Coalition (up one), 29.5% Labor (down one), 13% Greens (down 0.5), 4% One Nation (steady), 9% independents (up 0.5) and 5% others (steady). The headline figure is based on respondent preferences. By 2022 election preferences flows, there was a 50–50 tie, a one-point gain for the Coalition. EMRS Tasmanian poll: little change since May An EMRS Tasmanian state poll, conducted August 14–21 from a sample of 1,000, gave the Liberals 36% of the vote (up one since May), Labor 27% (down one), the Greens 14% (down one), the Jacqui Lambie Network (JLN) 8% (up one), independents 14% (steady) and others 3% (steady). Liberal incumbent Jeremy Rockliff held a 45–30 lead over Labor’s Dean Winter as preferred premier (40–32 in May). At the March state election, three JLN MPs were elected, but analyst Kevin Bonham reported on August 25 that two of these MPs had been expelled by the party. So the current standings of the Tasmanian lower house are 14 Liberals out of 35, ten Labor, five Greens, five independents and one JLN. The Liberals need four of the six crossbenchers to pass legislation opposed by Labor and the Greens. The EMRS poll was done before the JLN blew up. NT likely election result For the August 24 Northern Territory election, the ABC is giving the Country Liberal Party (CLP) 17 of the 25 seats, Labor four, independents three and one seat (Nightcliff) is undecided, but Labor is expected to beat the Greens after distribution of preferences. The Greens were initially seen as likely to beat the CLP in Fannie Bay on Labor preferences, but the flow of Labor preferences to the Greens was weaker than expected, and the CLP will gain Fannie Bay from Labor.","summary":"The two-party preferred vote is tied again in Newspoll, but the prime minister’s net approval continues to slide.","url":"https://theconversation.com/newspoll-remains-tied-at-50-50-but-albaneses-net-approval-slumps-237549","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/616604/original/file-20240901-18-s588vm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=24%2C30%2C4052%2C2023&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 23:20:40","author":"Adrian Beaumont,Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate,School of Mathematics and Statistics,The University of Melbourne","authors":["Adrian Beaumont","Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate","School of Mathematics and Statistics","The University of Melbourne"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":255413712,"title":"Ketanji Brown Jackson 'Prepared' for Election to Go Before Supreme Court","text":"In an interview on CBS News Sunday Morning, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she is \"prepared\" for the 2024 presidential election to go before the Supreme Court.As part of the 10-minute interview with CBS Evening News anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell, Jackson, at first, jokingly replied to a question about being prepared for that scenario as former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris seem to be headed for a closely contested November election.\"Are you prepared that this election could end up in front of the Supreme Court?\" O'Donnell asked.\"As prepared as anyone can be,\" Jackson said with a laugh before asking O'Donnell, \"Are you prepared for all of the news cycles that you are getting as a result of this election?\"O'Donnell responded \"no\" as Jackson quipped \"no, exactly,\" as the two continued to laugh.Then, Jackson said, stoically, \"There are legal issues that arise out of the political process. So, the Supreme Court has to be prepared to respond if that should be necessary.\"Newsweek has emailed the Trump and Harris campaigns Sunday night for comment.In the 2000 presidential election, George W. Bush, a Republican, was ultimately declared the winner over former Vice President Al Gore, a Democrat, after the race came down to about 500 votes in Florida. Although Gore wanted to push forward with recounts, the Supreme Court, which was controlled by conservative justices at the time, ruled that vote counting standards in Florida were not consistent and halted a recount ordered by Florida's Supreme Court.Conservative Supreme Court justices currently outnumber their liberal cohorts, 6-3. Three of the conservative justices, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, were appointed by Trump during his first presidential term. Jackson, appointed by President Joe Biden, is among the liberal justices.But that ideological breakdown doesn't necessarily predict future decisions.In recent rulings, Barrett has slowly inched closer to the middle, battling Chief Justice John Roberts to be the court's ideological center. Last week, she sided with liberal justices in an Arizona voting rights case.In the interview with O'Donnell, Jackson openly expressed \"concern\" about the Court's recent presidential immunity ruling.In a decision handed down on July 1, the Supreme Court ruled that sitting presidents are immune from prosecution of alleged crimes that take place while performing certain official acts, siding partially with Trump in his quest to quash all of his recent legal troubles.Jackson and her two fellow liberals, Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan, dissented from the decision, while all six conservative justices voted in favor. In Sunday's interview, Jackson said she felt that the decision gave Trump unwarranted special treatment in criminal matters.\"I was concerned about a system that appeared to provide immunity for one individual under one set of circumstances, when we have a criminal justice system that had ordinarily treated everyone the same,\" Jackson said.In her written dissent of the immunity decision, Jackson warned that presidents could be \"exempt from legal liability for murder, assault, theft, fraud, or any other reprehensible and outlawed criminal act,\" as long as they claimed their actions were \"official acts.\"\"Stated simply: The Court has now declared for the first time in history that the most powerful official in the United States can (under circumstances yet to be fully determined) become a law unto himself,\" Jackson wrote. \"For my part, I simply cannot abide the majority's senseless discarding of a model of accountability for criminal acts that treats every citizen of this country as being equally subject to the law—as the Rule of Law requires,\" she added.On Tuesday, Department of Justice (DOJ) special counsel Jack Smith filed a revised indictment against Trump in his federal election interference case.Trump currently faces four federal charges in the case into his alleged attempts to thwart the 2020 election results, which the former president has claimed was stolen from him via widespread voter fraud despite a lack of substantial evidence.The charges include conspiracy to defraud the U.S., conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, attempting to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights.Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges and alleges the case is politically motivated.In addition, Trump was indicted in Georgia for alleged election fraud.In August 2023, Fani Willis, district attorney for Fulton County, Georgia, which covers most of Atlanta, indicted Trump and 18 of his allies for alleged fraud in the state involving the 2020 presidential election. All of the accused pleaded not guilty, but at least four are now cooperating with authorities.In a new court filing on Monday, Trump attorney Steven Sadow argued that Willis' election interference case against the former president should be dismissed in part because he believes Willis has been prejudiced against Trump.","summary":"Ketanji Brown Jackson said in an interview that aired Sunday, \"There are legal issues that arise out of the political process.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/ketanji-brown-jackson-2024-election-trump-harris-supreme-court-1947306","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2462157/brown-jackson-alabama.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 23:14:18","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.102},{"id":255413460,"title":"Sir Ian McKellen makes announcement on future after stage fall","text":"Sir Ian McKellen says he is looking to \"take the rest of the year off\" from acting following a fall on stage.

For much of the campaign, that effort to energize voters has favored Republicans, but new research from polling and data firm TargetSmart shows that Harris and newly energized Democrats have finally flipped the script on the MAGA movement. In a thread posted on X (formerly Twitter), TargetSmart Senior Advisor Tom Bonier shared the group’s stunning findings: In the more than a dozen states that have updated their voter files since late last month, Democrats have made record gains among every major voter group, blowing Republicans out of the water in the process. Black women ages 18 to 29 led the way, with a 175.8% increase in voter registrations compared with the same time period in 2020. Hispanic voters have also rushed to register since Harris became the Democratic nominee, with young Hispanic women posting a stunning 149.7% increase in registrations, and Hispanic voter registrations overall jumping over 60%. Women weren’t the only ones flocking to register. Registrations among Black voters leapt 85.8% over their 2020 numbers, while Asian Americans saw a 31.7% gain. Democrats as a whole saw a 51.2% increase in total registrations, compared with just 7% for Republicans. Those are game-changing numbers not just for Harris but also for Democrats up and down the ballot, and according to Bonier, those voters are also displaying higher enthusiasm than they did when Biden beat Trump four years ago. “You just don’t see that sort of thing happen in elections normally,” Bonider told CBS News on Wednesday, adding that the data indicated voters are “fired up and want to participate in this election.” The numbers back up Bonier’s confidence. A Gallup survey released this week found that 78% of Democratic-leaning voters say they are more enthusiastic than usual to vote. That nearly matches the record-high numbers recorded in 2008, when then-Sen. Barack Obama rode a wave of voter energy into the White House. By comparison, just 6 in 10 Republicans say they are more enthusiastic than usual—a lower number than around this point in 2020. Those numbers represent more than just a “fired up” voter base. The most recent benchmark for surging Democratic turnout came in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate the constitutional right to abortion, when record numbers of first-time voters cast ballots. According to Bonier, what he calls the “Harris Effect” has now surpassed even those monumental 2022 numbers—and they aren’t slowing down. That’s a huge shift from where the Democratic Party was just six weeks ago. It’s no secret that President Joe Biden was struggling to engage Democrats’ core constituencies. Democratic insiders openly fretted about a round of June polling that showed Biden losing large numbers of young voters, Black Americans, and Hispanic voters to Trump—and with it, key swing states like Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. The evidence is mounting that Harris’ dynamic campaign has not only reenergized those skeptical groups but also spiked interest and enthusiasm in the race in ways Republicans are struggling to counter-message. Once written off as Trump pickups, Sun Belt states such as Arizona and Nevada are now back in play. But there’s more: A new Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll published Thursday finds Harris leading or tied with Trump in all seven critical swing states. “When you’re seeing some of the swings in these polls we’ve seen over the last few weeks, a lot of that is actually … turnout voters who are persuadable,” Bonier told CNN’s Manu Raju. “The great position the Harris position finds itself in is that they don’t have to pick one path” to beating Trump in the Electoral College, Bonier added. Meanwhile, Trump’s road to the White House has narrowed considerably as Republicans find themselves spending money in once safe states, including North Carolina and Georgia. Now comes the challenging part: turning out those newly registered voters. In 2008, the Obama campaign focused millions of dollars on contacting new voters and building the infrastructure to ensure those voters made it to the polls on Election Day. Harris is now flush with over $540 million in fundraising in just over a month of campaigning. She certainly has the financial resources to build a larger voter mobilization operation than Obama, but she has only two months in which to actually get that nationwide network running. There’s little doubt that Biden’s decision to step down and endorse Harris was the catalyst for Democrats’ massive gains in recent voter registration. By listening to what voters wanted, Harris and Democrats reengaged millions of disaffected voters while registering many who had never before cast a ballot.

The original video can be viewed here. What does the secretary of commerce do? Until now, mainly promote U.S. businesses abroad. It had not been a high-profile job til Gina Raimondo turned the second-tier agency into a center of job creation, manufacturing, and national security. Once the governor of Rhode Island, Raimondo, at 53, seems to have come out of nowhere to become a rising star of the Democratic party, and of the Biden administration.As commerce secretary, she's running new projects that, as we first reported in April, could touch the lives of every American, and she's helping lead the expanding Cold War with China and confront Russia's aggression in Ukraine. The battlefield for both those conflicts is technology.Gina Raimondo: If you think about national security today in 2024, it's not just tanks and missiles; it's technology. It's semiconductors. It's AI. It's drones. And the Commerce Department is at the red-hot center of technology.And at the red-hot center: a global \"chip war\" that ramped up, says Gina Raimondo, when Russia invaded Ukraine. Gina Raimondo: The Commerce Department stopped all semiconductor chips from being sold to Russia. Every drone, every missile, every tank has semiconductors in them. And, you know Lesley, you know we are being effective because shortly after we started that work we heard stories of the Russians taking semiconductors out of refrigerators, out of dishwashers--Lesley Stahl: What?Gina Raimondo: –out, out of breast pumps, getting the chips--Lesley Stahl: Oh, come– Gina Raimondo: --to put them into their military equipment. Lesley Stahl: However, the Russians are now working their way around this--Gina Raimondo: They are.Lesley Stahl: --and successfully. And they're doing better in the war, probably, because of this. Gina Raimondo: You are right in what you say. But, she says-- Gina Raimondo: It's absolutely the case that our export controls have hurt their ability to conduct the war, made it harder. And we are enforcing this every minute of every day, doing everything we can.These are some of the enforcers: Thea Kendler (assistant secretary of commerce for Export Administration):Push to talk about our controls on Russia----Raimondo's team at Commerce that monitors and polices the ban on any company in the world from selling products with American chips in them to Russia. but not just Russia.President Biden (during State of the Union): I've made sure that the most advanced American technologies can't be used in China. The Chinese warn that these export controls could trigger an escalating trade war.Lesley Stahl: Trade with China accounts for 750,000 U.S. jobs. Gina Raimondo: Mmhmm.Lesley Stahl: And if trade ends, we lose those jobs. Gina Raimondo: We want to trade with China on the vast majority of goods and services. But on those technologies that affect our national security, no. Lesley Stahl: Those advanced chips are in consumer goods. Banks use them—Gina Raimondo: Mmhmm. Lesley Stahl: --hospitals. This is going toward products that are made for civilian use. Gina Raimondo: Yep. Well, they also go into nuclear weapons, surveillance systems. And we know they want these chips and our sophisticated technology to advance their military.Her toughness has made her a target in China, where fake ads have her promoting the new Chinese-made smartphone.Last year, the government in Beijing hacked her email. When she was in China, on a trip ironically to improve relations, the tech company Huawei introduced that new smartphone with an advanced, Chinese-made chip. Lesley Stahl: It was kind of in your face—Gina Raimondo: Mmhmm. Lesley Stahl: --as if to say, \"Look at the chip that we have.\" And it was a pretty good, high-level chip, right? Gina Raimondo: Well, I have their attention, clearly. And--Lesley Stahl: And they've gotten yours.Gina Raimondo: Hmm. Well, what it tells me is the export controls are working because that chip is not nearly as good--Lesley Stahl: It's not?Gina Raimondo: --it's years behind what we have in the United States. We have the most sophisticated semiconductors in the world. China doesn't. We've out-innovated China.Lesley Stahl: Well, \"we,\" you mean Taiwan?Gina Raimondo: Fair. While American tech companies design the world's most advanced chips, none are actually made in the U.S. Ninety percent of them come from Taiwan, and they are key to the future of U.S. military weaponry. Lesley Stahl: And China, from time to time, threatens, you know, the wolf, to invade Taiwan. Gina Raimondo: Mmhmm. Lesley Stahl: And some people say the whole reason is to get their hands on those chips. Gina Raimondo: That's a problem, it's a risk, it makes us vulnerable. The problem of our outsourcing production goes way beyond high tech with millions of American workers having lost their jobs that went overseas, something Raimondo knows first-hand growing up as the youngest child in an Italian-American family in Rhode Island. Gina Raimondo: This is the old Bulova watch factory where my dad worked for almost 30 years.Her dad lost his job when Bulova abandoned the factory in 1983 and moved its operations to China. Gina Raimondo: It's hard for you to imagine it now as you look around here. But this was, you know, a bustling place. You know, they had 1,000 people working here, food trucks on the sidewalk, an electroplating shop there, a tool and dye shop there. And now, this is what you have. Lesley Stahl: And how old were you?Gina Raimondo: I was in, like, sixth grade. But I saw the toll it took on my dad and my family. And that influenced her career choices from when she studied economics and played rugby at Harvard– Gina Raimondo: So, this is my office.--to when she left a high-paying job as a venture capitalist to run for public office in Rhode Island. Gina Raimondo: This was the day that I was sworn in as State Treasurer, and those are my parents. That's my dad.Lesley Stahl: That's your dad--Gina Raimondo: Super proud of me.Lesley Stahl: --the man who worked at Bulova. Gina Raimondo: The man who worked at Bulova. The man who taught me about manufacturing, tau-- taught me that a job is about your pride, ability to take care of your family, not just a paycheck. Married with two children, Raimondo--a Rhodes scholar and Yale Law School graduate--was elected the state's first female governor in 2014 as a moderate, pro-business Democrat. Lesley Stahl: Liberals in your party, this is a quote, look upon you as a sellout to big business. Gina Raimondo: I think that's ridiculous. I hold businesses accountable as much as anyone. When I tell them they can't sell their semiconductors to China, they don't love that. But I do that.In late 2020, President-elect Joe Biden called her about leading the Commerce Department, which til then managed--without much fanfare or headlines--a mishmash of agencies and assignments, ranging from monitoring the weather to measuring the level of contaminants in household dust. Lesley Stahl: So, one day, President-elect Biden calls you and said, \"What about being Commerce Secretary?\" And you heard that and thought?Gina Raimondo: (laugh) Init-- truthfully, initially, I thought, \"What does the Commerce Secretary do?\" Lesley Stahl: Yeah. (laugh)Gina Raimondo: And then the president-elect said to me, \"Come. I want you to work with me to help rebuild American manufacturing.\" And I called my brother, my big brother, and he said, \"Gina, dad would be so proud. You gotta do it. You gotta do it.\" And that was it.Once at Commerce, she began to lean on Congress-Gina Raimondo (during congressional testimony): This is just good business----to fund her new programs with $100 billion, including $50 billion for the bipartisan \"CHIPS Act\" that she is now dispensing to reduce America's reliance on Taiwan.Gina Raimondo (during Intel \"CHIPS Act\" award announcement): It's a huge day for the entire country.In March, in Arizona, she announced her first award for making leading-edge chips in the U.S. to Intel. Gina Raimondo (during Intel \"CHIPS Act\" award announcement): We are announcing our intention to invest $8.5 billion in Intel, America's champion semiconductor company. (applause)Intel intends to construct and modernize facilities in Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, and Ohio. She's made other big awards totaling more than $20 billion, including one to Taiwan-based TSMC, and another to the South Korean company Samsung, to make the world's most advanced chips in Arizona and Texas.Raimondo is also spreading her largesse elsewhere in the country with another huge initiative, the \"Internet For All\" program.We went with her to a Corning factory in North Carolina, the world's largest manufacturer of fiber optic cable.Wendell Weeks: You're looking at fiber on these spools, all different colors. What's inside of there is actually one of the most precise products ever manufactured by man. Wendell Weeks, chairman and CEO of Corning, is expanding production to make some of the 10 million miles of new cable that's needed to connect the 24 million Americans, living mostly in rural America, who don't have access to high-speed internet. And under prodding by Raimondo, he's investing Corning's own capital to do it.Wendell Weeks: We've invested another half-billion dollars and doubled our footprint for the U.S. Lesley Stahl: When you're spending all this money to connect, you know, small numbers of people who live miles away, the expense almost doesn't make sense. Gina Raimondo: It does make sense. The internet is no longer a luxury. You need it to see the doctor, to go to school, to do your business, to pay your bills, to sign up for, you know, Social Security. Everyone has electricity in this country. Everyone ought to have the internet.Together, she says, the Internet For All and the CHIPS Act initiatives will create about a half-million jobs by 2030. But Wall Street is skeptical. Intel, for example, recently reported $7 billion in operating losses. Lesley Stahl: When you go to pick these different companies to give the money to-- Gina Raimondo: Mmhmm.Lesley Stahl: --it's, it's social, industrial policy, something, you know, we gave up because it was shown that private industry does a better job picking. You're smiling.Gina Raimondo: Well, do they? Because in the case of semiconductors the market didn't get it right. Lesley Stahl: How did we lose this? Gina Raimondo: We allowed manufacturing in this country to wither on the vine in search of cheaper labor in Asia, cheaper capital in Asia, and here we are. We just pursued profit over national security.Lesley Stahl: There are strings attached to these grants. They have to provide daycare. You want them to have a diverse workforce-- Gina Raimondo: Mmhmm. Lesley Stahl: --be union workers? Gina Raimondo: That is not social policy, Lesley. That's--Lesley Stahl: Sounds like it.Gina Raimondo: --it's math. This is pure math.Lesley Stahl: What do you--Gina Raimondo: You won't have enough workers to do the job unless you figure out how to get women working in the facilities. What I am--Lesley Stahl: But-- but on that point, if they need women--Gina Raimondo: Mmhmm. Lesley Stahl: --and women need daycare, that's a decision for the company to make. Why mandate it if it's what they need?Gina Raimondo: It's not mandated. To be clear, these are not mandates.Lesley Stahl: But it's written in there.Gina Raimondo: It is written. But you know what's funny, I never hear complaints about this from the companies. The only complaints I have are from politicians. In her nearly four years in Washington, Raimondo has elevated the Commerce Department and its secretary into a high-profile player. Gina Raimondo: China wakes up every day figuring out how to get around our regulations. We got to wake up every day that much more relentless and aggressive. So, I bring it every day. Lesley Stahl: So here comes the inevitable, obvious question that you know is coming your way. You are on a list of future presidential candidates. Does that sound good to you? Is it appetizing? Gina Raimondo: What sounds good to me is being the best commerce secretary there's ever been.One qualification for high office is being able to duck a question like that.Or a question about what role she might play in the next administration should Kamala Harris win the White House. Secretary Raimondo isn't saying, but rumor has it she'd be interested in becoming the next Treasury secretary.Produced by Richard Bonin. Associate producer, Mirella Brussani.

The conservative group’s “Joyful Warriors” summit, which organizers billed as “the ultimate gathering of parents fighting to defend their parental rights and improve education in America,” drew around 600 attendees over its four days of programming, according to The Atlantic. Many “stood in awe” of the grotesque, psuedo-satirical painting, the magazine reported. It portrayed the vice president—and Democratic nominee for president— kneeling over the bird’s bloodied corpse, gore all over her hands and mouth, a communist symbol stamped onto her jacket. Sitting on a stool in a corner in a dunce cap was President Joe Biden, an oversized knife in his back. Presumably to hammer home the apocalyptic overtones, a nuclear mushroom cloud blooms in the background. A label underneath, per photos posted on social media, identified the work as titled “We Did It Joe” and its creator as Scott LoBaido. Once characterized by The New York Times as “Staten Island’s most celebrated artist-provocateur,” LoBaido is a notorious MAGA activist-slash-creative known for his dozens of iterations of the American flag on canvas, as well as for occasional bouts of pro-Trump performance art. He has gifted the former president a number of his pieces, including most recently in July, when he presented Donald Trump with his rendering of the aftermath of his assassination attempt. Earlier this week, LoBaido began hyping up his latest work on social media, announcing that it would be unveiled on Friday in D.C. In a video filmed on the road to the capital, LoBaido boasted to his audience that he was going to have to “apologize to Leonardo da Vinci in advance” of the unveiling. “This painting, appropriately titled “We Did It Joe,” is going to be the next painting, for the next 500 years, that everybody’s going to know about,” he said. “They might not forget about the Mona Lisa, but she’s going to be in the back seat. It’s the way it is.” In another video the next day, LoBaido pulled a blue cloth off of the painting in front of the U.S. Capitol, promising that it would “change the course of history.” It was not clear if the original painting is for sale. (Signed 12-inch-by-16-inch poster prints, however, retail on his website for $59.) Neither LoBaido nor a representative for Moms for Liberty immediately responded to requests for comment on Sunday afternoon. Moms for Liberty has around 130,000 members around the country. Its summit featured panels on abolishing the Department of Education and pamphlets on child sex trafficking, and was headlined by the right-wing comedian Rob Schneider and former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. Still, proceedings crescendoed with a Friday night appearance by former president Donald Trump, who dropped in for what The Guardian called a “long, zigzagging and at times incoherent” conversation with the organization’s co-founder Tiffany Justice. They drifted from subject to subject, discussing everything from Ivanka Trump’s clothing line to The Apprentice to Trump’s recent stop at Arlington National Cemetery. One topic left unaddressed: Raw eagle entrails. A notoriously incurious gourmand, the former president likely wouldn’t leap at the chance to sample fresh meat with the gusto of LoBaido’s Harris. But if they were served well-done with ketchup? Perhaps.","summary":"Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersA painting depicting a laughing Kamala Harris tearing into the bloody guts of a dead bald eagle was front and center at the annual gathering of Moms for Liberty in the basement of a Washington, D.C. hotel this weekend, eliciting delight from attendees—and bemused side-eyes from online observers.\n\nThe conservative group’s “Joyful Warriors” summit, which organizers billed as “the ultimate gathering of parents fighting to defend their parental rights and improve education in America,” drew around 600 attendees over its four days of programming, according to The Atlantic. \n\nMany “stood in awe” of the grotesque, psuedo-satirical painting, the magazine reported.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/maga-artist-scott-lobaido-debuts-deranged-painting-of-kamala-harris-devouring-bald-eagle","image":"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3264,w_5803,x_0,y_253/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1725226372/2024-08-31T023218Z_803074756_RC2MQ9AS4SI5_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP_axakti","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 22:53:55","author":"Aj McDougall","authors":["Aj McDougall"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.065},{"id":255413924,"title":"Gov.

Tim Walz returns to the Minnesota State Fair for the first time as vice presidential nominee The Minnesota governor’s 30-minute State Fair appearance was tightly controlled as Walz balanced security with home state pride. By Briana Bierschbach The Minnesota Star Tribune September 1, 2024 at 10:47PM Gov. Tim Walz visited the Minnesota State Fair on Sunday for about a half-hour, eating a pork chop on a stick, serving soft serve ice cream, looking at butter carvings with Princess Kay of the Milky Way and posing for selfies. (Glen Stubbe/The Minnesota Star Tribune) Arriving at the Minnesota State Fair Sunday morning, Gov. Tim Walz made a beeline for the pork-chop-on-a-stick stand. Meandering wasn’t an option. Walz’s return to the Great Minnesota Get-Together, the first since joining Kamala Harris’ ticket as vice presidential nominee, was a tightly controlled 30-minute affair, complete with metal barricades, security dogs and United States Secret Service agents patrolling the grounds and perched on rooftops. “I don’t get 12 days, which I normally get,” Walz said of his State Fair experience since he’s been thrust into the national spotlight. “It’s a little bit more of a disruption … but it’s exciting. I think people are seeing we’re getting to talk about Minnesota across the country.” In a short time-frame, Walz still managed to squeeze in several quintessential fair stops, including a tour through the Dairy Building, where swarms of people — some unsuspecting — held out their phones to try and snap a photo or selfie with the governor. Buzz spread around the fairgrounds early in the morning that Walz might make his return on Sunday. “We were going to come in and get a malt and we could see all the security and we just said, ‘It’s probably Walz.’ So we thought, ‘Perfect, we’ll go inside,’ ” said Nathan Laible, who lives in Golden Valley and snapped a few shots of the governor walking through the building. “We did not get the malt, but we did get something better.” Walz, followed by a line of staff and security, handed out soft-serve ice cream cones to fairgoers with his wife, Gwen, and daughter Hope. Afterward, he chatted with Rachel Visser, a 19-year-old college student from Hutchinson, this year’s Princess Kay of the Milky Way. She showed him her likeness carved into butter in a see-through refrigerator. He declared Minnesota’s state fair the greatest in the country and said “agriculture is still king in Minnesota.” “We see that many of these folks are going to participate in agribusiness over their lifetime,” Walz said, wearing a “Minnesota Grown” hat and T-shirt and holding a melting vanilla shake in his hand. He shook hands and posed for selfies along a roped-off section of the building, making a pit stop to buy a koozie with a fishing reel attached to it before leaving the fairgrounds. It was a friendly but chaotic return to the fair for Walz, who last year wandered freely throughout the grounds, trying new state fair foods and talking to constituents with minimal staff and security. Everything changed 26 days ago when he was named Harris’ running mate. Related Coverage Twin Cities Tim Walz, governor and gamer, once owned a Sega Dreamcast. Here’s what happened to it. Twin Cities Lawsuit: State leaders are illegally withholding records on Tim Walz’s riot response He’s been campaigning almost nonstop in battleground states across the country, attending political conventions and fundraisers and addressing rallies of thousands alongside Harris. The Minnesota State Fair became part of the push for Walz on social media as he was being considered for the vice president nomination, a perfect locale to showcase his Midwestern, regular-guy appeal. Supporters posted videos of him with his daughter on the fair’s slingshot ride, Walz cradling a newborn piglet in his arms at the Miracle of Birth Center and claiming turkey isn’t meat in Minnesota, it’s “special.” Many of the people who flocked to the dairy building were wearing Harris-Walz pins, hats and T-shirts, but there were detractors, too. Two people carried “Never Walz” fans, which are being handed out at the conservative group Action 4 Liberty’s booth this year. One person passed by the line of people waiting to meet the governor and said they “couldn’t care less.” Politicians typically attend the fair to woo voters from across the state, and Walz is far from the first candidate on a presidential ticket to make the trip. Most recently, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders stopped at the fairgrounds in 2019, and it’s where Theodore Roosevelt famously said: “Speak softly and carry a big stick.” But as the hometown candidate, Walz needed no introduction. Some supporters chanted “Walz, Walz, Walz” as he handed out cones. Wesley Poland and his son Vincent drove to the fair from Blaine on Sunday and caught a glimpse of Walz as he greeted people. Wesley said he’s been a fan of the governor for years but watching him on the national stage has shown a “side of him that you’ve never seen before.” Vincent is voting in his first presidential election this year and has decided to support the Democratic ticket.

After the Israeli military confirmed the deaths of US-Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin and five others in Gaza on Saturday, Trump took to Truth Social to criticize his political rivals, claiming that he could have secured the safety of the hostages if he were still president. “Make no mistake – This happened because Comrade Kamala Harris and Crooked Joe Biden are poor Leaders,” the GOP presidential candidate wrote. “They have blood on their hands!” he added. “…Our Country and our amazing people are not safe under Joe Biden, and will be less safe under Kamala Harris. “This terror would have never happened if I were President, and it will stop the day I am back in the Oval Office. America will be Strong Again, and that will make the World Safe and Secure!” Trump’s post came after the president and vice president spoke with Goldberg-Polin’s parents, with Harris tweeting about her phone call with the heartbroken mom and dad alongside her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish. “Doug and I just spoke to Jon and Rachel, Hersh Goldberg-Polin’s parents, to express our condolences following the brutal murder of their son by Hamas terrorists,” Harris said, who is facing Trump in November. “My heart breaks for their pain and anguish. “I told them: As they mourn this terrible loss, they are not alone,” she added. “Our nation mourns with them.” The bodies of the dead hostages were found in Rafah, the southern Gaza hub where the Harris-Biden administration had repeatedly pushed for Israel to avoid direct action, with President Biden previously saying it would cross a “red line.” Biden also slammed Hamas over the recent deaths of the hostages, who the Israeli health ministry confirmed were killed by short-range shots two to three days before their bodies were found. “I am devastated and outraged,” Biden said in a statement. “Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes.” Along with Golderg-Polin, 23, the victims whose bodies were recovered Saturday were identified as Ori Danino, 25; Eden Yerushalmi, 24; Almog Sarusi, 27; Alexander Lobanov, 33, and Carmel Gat, 40.","summary":"Donald Trump on Sunday slammed President Biden and Veep Kamala Harris for the recent deaths of six Hamas hostages, blaming the horrific loss on the Dem pair's \"poor\" leadership.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/01/world-news/trump-slams-harris-biden-over-hostage-deaths-in-gaza-they-have-blood-on-their-hands/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/republican-presidential-nominee-former-president-88760729.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 22:25:12","author":"Ronny Reyes","authors":["Ronny Reyes"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.319},{"id":255411902,"title":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Lashes Out at 'Predatory' Jill Stein","text":"In an Instagram story posted on Sunday, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, blasted Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein as \"predatory\" due to her multiple runs for the White House while struggling to grow the third party at the grassroots level.In 2016, Stein played kingmaker in several key battleground states. Her vote total was higher than Donald Trump's margin of victory in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan—prompting intense backlash from Democrats and political pundits. Not only was Stein widely condemned as a spoiler, but former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was the Democratic nominee during the 2016 election, later accused her of being a \"Russian asset.\"Ocasio-Cortez accused Stein and the Green Party, which reached its current party status in 2001, for only putting its emphasis on presidential elections. To date, no Green Party candidate has ever held a federal office and only a handful have been elected as state legislators.Ocasio-Cortez, responding to a question from an Instagram follower about Jill Stein's candidacy, said that \"this is a little spicy, but I have thoughts.\"\"If you run for years in a row, and your party has not grown, has not added city council seats, down ballot seats and state electives, that's bad leadership. And that to me is what's upsetting,\" the congresswoman said about Stein.Stein will be on the ballot in Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and West Virginia, according to Ballotpedia's most-recent update.She will also be on the ballot in Montana, Utah, Nevada, Alaska, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Maine, Maryland and Missouri, Stein's campaign manager Jason Call previously told Newsweek.Meanwhile, the Green Party is on the ballot in Mississippi, South Carolina and Hawaii.The reason for why Stein is on the ballot in some states and the Green Party is on in others is because of ballot access procedures.On its website, the Green Party states that \"at least 144 [party members] hold elected office in 20 states across the United States as of February 15, 2024.\" The list includes Green Party members of local school, zoning and tax boards, as well as several city council members.The New York Democrat said that Stein had been the Green Party's candidate for 12 years in a row. However, Howie Hawkins ran as the party's nominee in 2020.\"If you have been your party's nominee for 12 years in a row, and you cannot grow your movement, pretty much at all, and can't peruse any successful strategy...and all you do is show up every four years to speak to people who are justifiably pissed off, you're not serious. To me, it does not read as authentic, it reads as predatory. I'm sorry, I'm just saying it,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in her Instagram story.She also asserted that she's not against third parties, overall, and that she has and will continue to endorse some third-party candidates, even against Democrats.\"What I have a problem with is, if you're running for president, you are the DeFacto leader of your party. I've been on record with criticisms of the two-party system. This is not about that,\" the congresswoman added.Newsweek has emailed the Stein campaign and Ocasio-Cortez's office Sunday afternoon for comment.The Democratic Party has gone through considerable legal efforts to challenge third parties from appearing on ballots.Before independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump, Democratic-funded lawsuits had successfully removed him from the ballot in New York and had tried and failed to remove him in North Carolina and New Jersey.On Monday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected an attempt by Democratic National Committee (DNC) official David Strange to knock Stein off the state's ballot this year.Strange said that the Green Party should not be allowed to nominate presidential electors in Wisconsin because it does not have any state officeholders or legislative candidates to nominate these presidential electors. However, the court ruled that \"the petitioner is not entitled to the relief he seeks.\"Michael White, co-chair of the Wisconsin Green Party, said the complaint was a \"mark of fear by the Democratic Party.\"In her 2017 book, What Happened, Clinton wrote: \"So in each state, there were more than enough Stein voters to swing the result.\"Nationally, Stein received 1 percent of the vote in 2016, just under 1.5 million votes. In the 2020 election between Trump and Joe Biden, the Green Party's candidate, Hawkins, only received 0.2 percent of the popular vote.When asked recently by Newsweek if she feared a similar backlash after Trump's 2016 victory when Clinton and many in the Democratic Party blamed her for taking crucial votes in several battleground states, Stein said those \"smear or fear campaigns by the parties of Wall Street have never stopped.\"\"The exit polls showed the vast majority of our votes in 2016 were non-voters,\" Stein said, stating it is nonsense to claim her party took votes away from Clinton. \"That campaign has never stopped and doesn't influence my thinking. My thinking is on the climate catastrophe, economic hardships and stopping endless wars.\"In addition to Stein, Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris could also lose votes in key states to Cornel West, the \"Justice for All Party\" presidential candidate.According to the Associated Press, a cohort of Republican strategists, attorneys, and supporters nationwide are striving to influence the upcoming November elections in a manner that potentially benefits Trump. Their objective is to bolster third-party candidates like West who present liberal voters with a different option that might divert support from Harris.The funding source for this initiative remains ambiguous, but it holds substantial potential to alter outcomes in states that saw extremely narrow margins in the 2020 election won by Biden.West's campaign has encouraged the effort. Last month, the academic told the AP that \"American politics is highly gangster-like activity\" and he \"just wanted to get on that ballot.\"Trump has offered praise for West, calling him \"one of my favorite candidates.\" Of Stein, the former president favors her for the same reason.\"I like her very much. You know why? She takes 100 percent from them. He takes 100 percent,\" Trump has said.","summary":"In an Instagram story on Sunday, the New York congresswoman accused Stein and the Green Party for only putting its emphasis on presidential elections.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-blasts-predatory-jill-stein-green-party-2024-election-1947286","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2462137/aoc-jill-stein.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 22:17:30","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.015},{"id":255413008,"title":"California Activists Warn Kamala Harris's Failure to Campaign on Reparations Will Hurt Her","text":"A California pro-reparations group is threatening Gov. Gavin Newsom and other state legislators to pass slavery reparations bills, or the racial backlash will have a “direct impact” on Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign. Lawmakers decided to hold off on passing two state Senate Bills on Saturday after “heated” deliberations and protests over legislation proposed in response to racial discrimination and the enslavement of black Americans, Fox News reported. While measures for returning land to or compensating families who had their property “unjustly seized by the government” and issuing formal apologies were approved, the outlet reported that SBs 1403 and 1331 — which would have established a reparations fund and given Newsom-appointed leaders the power to oversee compensation methods — were left out. California Legislative Black Caucus Chair Lori Wilson announced that her group pulled the bills because they needed more work. “We knew from the very beginning that it was an uphill battle…. And we also knew from the very beginning that it would be a multiyear effort,” Wilson told the press following the legislative session. Members of the reparations advocate group Coalition for a Just and Equitable California were enraged. “The speaker needs to bring the bills up now, now, now. These are their bills. They have their names on the bills. They’re killing their own bills because they’re scared of the governor,” one man with the coalition told reporters: “They’re killing the bills because they’re scared of the governor.” Advocates for Reparations bills to establish new CA freedman affairs agency and reparations fund are urging Assembly to vote on the bills. “This is going to impact your friend, Kamala Harris..” pic.twitter.com/PeLi3EgGDZ — Ashley Zavala (@ZavalaA) August 31, 2024 “Now listen, they’re gonna see this, and they’re gonna get mad at us.

Bring the goddamn bills up now, now, now.” A woman with the coalition concurred, saying, “We need to send a message to the governor.” “The governor needs to understand the world is watching California and this is gonna have a direct impact on your friend Kamala Harris who is running for president,” the woman warned. “This is going to have a direct impact, so pull up the bills now, vote on them and sign them. We’ve been waiting for over 400 years.” “We have the votes,” the man added. According to the author of SBs 1403 and 1331, state Sen. Steven Bradford (D), the fear that Newsom would kill the bills kept his fellow lawmakers from advancing them. “We’re at the finish line, and we, as the Black Caucus, owe it to the descendants of chattel slavery, to Black Californians and Black Americans, to move this legislation forward,” Bradford reportedly told his colleagues in the chamber. “We owe it to our ancestors,” he added. “And I think we disappointed them in a way.” While Newsom did strike a deal with legislators to spend $12 million to implement proposals to provide reparations for slavery in June, the budget did not specify how exactly the money would be sent, Breitbart News reported. According to Fox News, his administration has also “signaled its opposition” to some of the reparations methods proposed. The governor must decide to sign the bills that passed by the end of the month. The California Legislative Black Caucus responded to the backlash in a statement posted to X, saying the pulled bills were not part of their 2024 “Reparations Priority Package” and that they remain “committed” to the long-term goals of “advancing reparations”: — @clbcpolicyinstitute (@CABlackCaucus) August 31, 2024 The statement was labeled as “lies” by the Coalition for a Just and Equitable California, claiming the caucus “cheated to stop #Reparations bills from getting to the Governor’s desk”: This statement is false.

The rematch election battle between first-term Republican Anthony D’Esposito and Democrat Laura Gillen is an opportunity for Dems to get their mojo back on the island after getting trounced in three election cycles — while the GOP is looking for a victory that would prove the area is becoming reliably red. Democrats — who took some bruising in the area in recent years due to backlash over the state legislature’s liberal criminal justice reforms — are hoping this go-round that Gillen can unseat D’Esposito in the 4th district just two years after he beat her by more than 10,000 votes. In the rematch D’Esposito is up by 6 percentage points, leading 48% to 42% in the district, which borders New York City, according to an internal campaign poll conducted by McLaughlin Associates in mid-August. “Laura Gillen has been rejected twice. She will be rejected a third time,” D’Esposito said of his opponent, who lost her own re-election bid in 2019 after she was the first Democrat to hold the seat in a century. Gillen said she’s campaigning as an “independent,” pro-safety Democrat who condemned a state law that blocked judges from setting cash bail for numerous crimes. She also said she backs tougher border security. “We need to seal our border. [D’Esposito] failed to get this done,” she said. The congressman said he supports policies to deport migrants who entered the country illegally, especially those committing crimes — and he bashed Gillen for her support for President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris who he called “the two people who created the disaster at the border.” Gillen is following a similar playbook as some other Democrats in this year’s elections, saying she’ll protect abortion rights in the first election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. She has criticized her opponent for allegedly shifting on the issue. “I have consistently been an advocate for reproductive rights,” she said. D’Esposito countered, “I would never support a nationwide abortion ban. I never have and never will.” He said he supports in-vitro fertilization and called Gillen’s abortion push as “her whole campaign.” The 4th District includes portions of Nassau County on the border with Queens, including Hempstead, Valley Stream, Uniondale and Freeport. Some 40% of the district’s voters are registered Democrats, with 30% registered Republicans and 30% registered independents. Jewish residents account for 20% of the electorate, including a growing number of orthodox residents in the 5 towns that are voting Republican, according to analyses. With the presidential race at the top of the ticket some insiders say Democratic nominee Harris is a “wild card” if she has strong support against GOP candidate Donald Trump from the sizable black population in the district. D’Esposito’s internal poll showed Trump and Harris tied at 46% while independent Robert Kennedy Jr. — who has since dropped out of the race — had 5%. President Biden carried the district over Trump 55% to 45% in 2020 but trailed Trump by 7-percentage points in a previous internal campaign poll in June. Harris has closed that gap since Biden dropped out of the race, the poll showed.","summary":"In what could turn out to be the tightest congressional race in New York and a bellwether for which party controls the House, Republican Rep.

The Minnesota governor was posed the question at his home state’s state fair in St. Paul, hours after the bodies were found in an underground tunnel in the Rafah area of the city. From the footage, it was unclear whether the potential vice president heard the inquiry, but as soon as it was uttered, he bid onlookers farewell. The captives – identified Saturday as Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Master Sgt Ori Danino – were among the more than 200 taken by militants on October 7. Five were taken from the targeted Israeli music festival, and another from a nearby farming community. The IDF said all were ‘brutally’ murdered ‘a short while’ before troops were able to locate them. Scroll down for video: ‘What’s your reaction to the six hostages found in Gaza,’ the unseen journalist asks in the clip, which shows Walz clutching a milkshake as he made rounds during his brief drop-in at the 12-day event. At that point, a staffer for the politician appears to motion to him that it’s time to leave, leading Walz to announce his departure. ‘All right, thanks everybody!’ he tells the crowd, before walking off to a round of applause. Joined by his wife, Gwen, and their daughter Hope, the politician was swiftly surrounded by a security detail before being whisked away. At another point during his visit, the 60-year-old munched on a porkchop on a stick – a local delicacy. ‘For those not from Minnesota, just to be clear, there’s a lot of great state fairs in the country, this is the best one,’ Walz told reporters, in another light exchange. ‘I can say that having tried pork chops in Iowa,’ he went on to joke, ‘I’m so happy I got a day out here.’ Sharing video of him eating the street food at the festival frequented by local farmers, he posted on Twitter: ‘Breakfast of champions: pork chop on a stick.’ The visit also saw Walz repeatedly highlight his state’s farming sector, as local ranchers and landowners championed their products. In all, he spent about an hour there, before leaving ahead of a planned meeting with union leaders in Milwaukee Monday. Staying away from subjects like policy, he told local outlet mprnews of how he’s balanced his role as Governor amid his and Harris’s whirlwind campaign. ‘I got a good team being able to manage my schedule,’ he told onlookers. Meanwhile, overseas, the bodies of the long-missing hostages were located. A senior Hamas official, Izzat al-Rishq, insisted Israel was responsible for their deaths, as it has refused to sign a ceasefire deal. Such sentiments were echoed Saturday by a group representing the families of those held hostage, who demanded Netanyahu ‘address the nation and take responsibility for abandoning the hostages’. ‘The delay in signing the deal has led to their deaths and those of many other hostages,’ they wrote. They further claimed that all six captives were ‘murdered in the last few days, after surviving almost 11 months of abuse, torture, and starvation in Hamas captivity’. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, said Saturday that Israel would not rest until those responsible were brought to justice. ‘Whoever murders hostages – does not want a deal,’ he proclaimed. The IDF added that the location the bodies were discovered was a little over half a mile from a tunnel where another hostage was rescued alive days earlier, two days after Walz appeared alongside running mate Kamala Harris for an interview on CNN. During the sitdown, both stopped short of saying they would alter Biden’s policy toward arm sales to Israel – a sticking point to some voters. Despite airing some desired changes to some policies, Harris said her policy on arming Israel will not change if she is elected president. In the days since, neither have commented on the recent discovery.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTim Walz appeared to make a quick escape Saturday when asked about&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: See Tim Walz&#8217;s surprising response to question about Israeli captives killed in Gaza. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/see-tim-walzs-surprising-response-to-question-about-israeli-captives-killed-in-gaza/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Watch-Tim-Walzs-shocking-reaction-when-asked.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 21:54:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.086},{"id":255410910,"title":"Trump Posts Ominous Message About 'Kamala's Open Border'","text":"Former President Donald Trump escalated his rhetoric on illegal immigration on Sunday, posting an ominous image to X, formerly Twitter, about Vice President Kamala Harris and security at the U.S.-Mexico border.The image, posted to the former president's official X account with nearly 5 million views, depicts a shadowy male figure wielding a knife and approaching a woman in a dimly lit alley. Written on the photo are the words \"No One Is Safe With Kamala's Open Border\"—an apparent reference to his fierce criticisms of the Biden administration's immigration policies regarding the southern border.Some Republicans, including Trump and his running mate Ohio Senator JD Vance, have labeled Harris as Biden's \"border czar,\" though she was never officially given that title. Biden assigned her the task of addressing the \"root causes\" of migration to the United States from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.Trump, the GOP's presidential nominee, continued on Sunday to post other ominous campaign messaging photos signaling the destruction of the United States with a potential Harris presidency.Newsweek contacted Trump's campaign and Harris' spokesperson via email on Sunday for comment.In a summer attack ad, Trump accused Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, of \"intentionally unsecur[ing] the border.\" The ad claimed that the vice president \"halted construction of President Trump's border wall\" and \"took more than 94 executive actions to unsecure the border.\"Trump has repeatedly targeted Harris in his campaign messaging. In August, he shared a bullet-point list on X detailing how \"KAMALA INTENTIONALLY UNSECURED THE BORDER.\" The post, which at the time had been viewed 5.5 million times, included claims that Harris \"opposes all deportations\" and \"supports deadly sanctuary cities.\"The former president has also accused Harris of supporting \"mass amnesty for millions of illegals\" and wanting to \"give them government benefits.\"Harris, meanwhile, has defended the Biden administration's approach to illegal immigration, arguing that long-term solutions are needed to address the complexity of the situation.During a 2021 joint news conference with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, Harris said that the U.S. \"will continue to enforce our laws and secure our borders. If you come to our border, you will be turned back.\"The Biden administration has defended its border policies, pointing to increased funding for border security technology and personnel. Officials also highlight efforts to work with Central American countries to address the factors driving migration, including poverty, violence, and climate change.During Harris' campaign rally in Atlanta, she said the former president \"doesn't care about the border, he only cares about himself.\"\"Donald Trump has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk...\"Republicans, however, argue that these measures have been insufficient to stem the flow of migrants at the southern border. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported over 2 million encounters with migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2023, a record high.

In an interview with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Welker challenged the Republican over former President Donald Trump’s visit last week to Arlington National Cemetery to pay his respects to the 13 fallen American soldiers on the third anniversary of the terror attack on Abbey Gate at the international airport in Kabul. The Harris/Walz campaign accused Trump of politicizing the memorial, amid controversy over whether his campaign could take photos or video. In response, the Gold Star families criticized Harris for the botched Afghanistan withdrawal and for failing to call or meet with them. NBC’s Welker picked up the thread of argument with Cotton, before making an incorrect claim: NBC’s @kwelkernbc tried to excuse the fact that Kamala has never reached out to the Gold Star families of the 13 fallen service members from Abbey Gate by saying she and Biden “met with them during the dignified transfer.” There’s only one problem: Kamala was not in fact at the… pic.twitter.com/BJK6RmlodB — Greg Price (@greg_price11) September 1, 2024 “Well, they did meet with them at the dignified transfer.

The Minnesota governor was posed the question at his home state's state fair in St. Paul, hours after the bodies were found in an underground tunnel in the Rafah area of the city. From the footage, it was unclear whether the potential vice president heard the inquiry, but as soon as it was uttered, he bid onlookers farewell. The captives - identified Saturday as Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Master Sgt Ori Danino - were among the more than 200 taken by militants on October 7. Five were taken from the targeted Israeli music festival, and another from a nearby farming community. The IDF said all were 'brutally' murdered 'a short while' before troops were able to locate them. Scroll down for video: 'What's your reaction to the six hostages found in Gaza,' the unseen journalist asks in the clip, which shows Walz clutching a milkshake as he made rounds during his brief drop-in at the 12-day event. At that point, a staffer for the politician appears to motion to him that it's time to leave, leading Walz to announce his departure. 'All right, thanks everybody!' he tells the crowd, before walking off to a round of applause. Joined by his wife, Gwen, and their daughter Hope, the politician was swiftly surrounded by a security detail before being whisked away. At another point during his visit, the 60-year-old munched on a porkchop on a stick - a local delicacy. 'For those not from Minnesota, just to be clear, there's a lot of great state fairs in the country, this is the best one,' Walz told reporters, in another light exchange. 'I can say that having tried pork chops in Iowa,' he went on to joke, 'I'm so happy I got a day out here.' Sharing video of him eating the street food at the festival frequented by local farmers, he posted on Twitter: 'Breakfast of champions: pork chop on a stick.' The visit also saw Walz repeatedly highlight his state's farming sector, as local ranchers and landowners championed their products. In all, he spent about an hour there, before leaving ahead of a planned meeting with union leaders in Milwaukee Monday. Staying away from subjects like policy, he told local outlet mprnews of how he's balanced his role as Governor amid his and Harris's whirlwind campaign. 'I got a good team being able to manage my schedule,' he told onlookers. Meanwhile, overseas, the bodies of the long-missing hostages were located. A senior Hamas official, Izzat al-Rishq, insisted Israel was responsible for their deaths, as it has refused to sign a ceasefire deal. Such sentiments were echoed Saturday by a group representing the families of those held hostage, who demanded Netanyahu 'address the nation and take responsibility for abandoning the hostages'. 'The delay in signing the deal has led to their deaths and those of many other hostages,' they wrote. They further claimed that all six captives were 'murdered in the last few days, after surviving almost 11 months of abuse, torture, and starvation in Hamas captivity'. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, said Saturday that Israel would not rest until those responsible were brought to justice. 'Whoever murders hostages - does not want a deal,' he proclaimed. The IDF added that the location the bodies were discovered was a little over half a mile from a tunnel where another hostage was rescued alive days earlier, two days after Walz appeared alongside running mate Kamala Harris for an interview on CNN. During the sitdown, both stopped short of saying they would alter Biden's policy toward arm sales to Israel - a sticking point to some voters. Despite airing some desired changes to some policies, Harris said her policy on arming Israel will not change if she is elected president. In the days since, neither have commented on the recent discovery.","summary":"The Minnesota governor was posed the question at his home state's state fair hours after the bodies were found in an underground tunnel in the Rafah area of the war-ridden strip.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13802549/Tim-Walz-minnesota-state-fair-hostages-israel.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/01/21/89163841-0-image-a-36_1725221017580.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 21:41:50","author":"Alex Hammer,Editor","authors":["Alex Hammer","Editor"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.086},{"id":255410492,"title":"‘Abandon Harris’ campaign tries to swing Muslim-Americans against veep in key swing states","text":"The Abandon Biden campaign is relaunching and “intensifying” its campaign, this time focusing its efforts against Vice President Kamala Harris in key swing states. The campaign released a statement on X last week, announcing that it is “ramping up efforts in key swing states to rally Muslim-Americans and their allies against the Harris-Walz ticket.” “This action is a direct response to Kamala Harris’ support for the ongoing genocide in Gaza,” the Abandon Harris campaign said in the release. The movement, which originated in the heavily Muslim-populated city of Dearborn, Michigan, first targeted the re-election campaign of President Biden during primary season, arguing that the president’s continued support for Israel made it necessary for the community to send a message to the Democratic Party. Along with movements such as the “Vote Uncommitted” movement that bubbled up in Dearborn around the same time, the campaigns were able to get over 100,000 voters to cast uncommitted ballots during the Michigan primary earlier this year. Biden’s decision to drop out of the race in July and the subsequent elevation of Harris to the top of the ticket seemingly cracked the door open that members of the movement may be able to rally support for the Democratic ticket, but tensions between Harris and the campaign’s leaders have continued as the vice president has failed to fully commit to their demands. “We are not interested in hollow rhetoric, empty platitudes, or shallow calls for a ceasefire while the Biden-Harris administration continues to send weapons to Israel, enabling the indiscriminate slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza and fueling a wider regional conflict,” the campaign said in the release. “Words without meaningful action are meaningless, and the continued complicity in these atrocities will not be tolerated.” During the primary season, the group was able to spread its influence from Michigan to Wisconsin, two critical swing states in November’s election. Both states have been decided by razor-thin margins in the previous two presidential elections, making the lack of support from a demographic that has leaned heavily Democratic for much of the last 20 years a potentially decisive factor in the states. As of Sunday, the Real Clear Politics Polling average shows Harris with slim leads in both states, coming in with a 1.1 point lead in Michigan and a 1.4 point lead in Wisconsin. The campaign has also looked to expand to other swing states, having had success pivoting to states such as Minnesota during the primary season. While the group did not offer support for the campaign of former President Donald Trump, it urged supporters “to avoid falling into the complacent trap of abstaining from the 2024 election” and “to vote against genocide and to support third-party candidates as a clear message that we reject any party that participates in or supports genocide.” “At this time, we have not issued an endorsement of any specific third-party candidate. If and when that changes, we will announce it,” the release said. “Abandon Biden, now Abandon Harris, will not cede a single inch,” the release continued. “We remain firm and steadfast in our convictions and our mission to ensure that the party currently supporting, funding and enabling the Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza is defeated at the polls.” Reached for comment by Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for Abandon Harris said that the campaign had “extended an olive branch to Kamala Harris and expressed our openness to dialogue” after Biden’s decision to drop out of the race. “After nearly a month of waiting, during which she had a disastrous rally in Michigan where she inadvertently revealed her stance on those protesting the genocide in Gaza, we launched Abandon Harris on August 19,” the spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that the organization believes there is nothing Harris can do to regain their support, but noted that they do not encourage anyone to vote for Trump. “We remember Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, as well as his stance during Gaza’s Great March of Return,” the spokesperson said. “We have consistently urged voters not to support either the Democratic or Republican parties, while also making it clear that sitting out the election is not an acceptable option.” The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.","summary":"The Abandon Biden campaign is relaunching and \"intensifying\" its campaign, this time focusing its efforts against Vice President Kamala Harris in key swing states.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/01/us-news/abandon-harris-campaign-tries-to-swing-muslim-americans-against-veep-in-key-swing-states/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/2024-savannah-georgia-harris-campaigned-88756798.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/zrfNTnvb-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-01 21:40:36","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.53},{"id":255410908,"title":"First 2024 Election Mail Ballots Scheduled to Go Out This Week","text":"While there are around 60 days until Election Day on Nov. 5, the first mail-in ballots are slated to reach voters starting this week. The first batch of ballots are typically sent out to military and overseas voters. Under federal law, that must happen at least 45 days before an election—which this year is Sept. 21. “The county boards of elections will begin to mail absentee ballots to eligible voters who requested one for the 2024 general election,” the site says. Voter registration deadlines vary by state, with most falling between eight and 30 days before the election, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The deadline is Oct. 7 in Georgia, one of this year’s most prominent presidential battlegrounds. Other than Pennsylvania, the states that begin mailing ballots to voters more than 45 days before the election are Arkansas, Delaware, Kentucky, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, according to the organization. Meanwhile, Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, and Wyoming will start mailing ballots to voters 45 days before the election. “Approximately 2 million ballots statewide have already been printed with Kennedy’s name on them, and the first ballots will be sent to absentee voters in eight days,” the board said on Aug. 29. The first presidential debate is set for Sept. 10 between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s nominee. Her pick for vice president, Tim Walz, and Trump’s Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) have agreed to an Oct. 1 debate hosted by CBS News in New York City. It’s not clear if any other debates will be held. Last week, Trump publicly suggested he might pull out of the ABC debate, citing his own concerns about bias at the network, but said in a follow-up post on Truth Social that he will attend the debate. He also suggested a debate be held on Fox News, but the Harris camp declined that offer. Trump, the Republican nominee, is also scheduled to be sentenced in his New York case on Sept. 18. But his lawyers have asked the judge to delay the proceeding until after Election Day. A decision is expected in early September. Prosecutors wrote that due to “the defense’s newly stated position, we defer to the Court on whether an adjournment is warranted to allow for orderly appellate litigation of that question, or to reduce the risk of a disruptive stay from an appellate court pending consideration of that question.” Merchan is also scheduled to rule on a Trump request to overturn the guilty verdict that was handed down against him in late May. His attorneys separately sought to have the verdict overturned due to a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, arguing that some evidence prosecutors had used should be now omitted. The former president was convicted by a New York jury on May 31 on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal payments made during the 2016 election. He had pleaded not guilty to the charges, often describing them as politically motivated and designed to interfere with the 2024 election. That conviction was the first time in U.S. history that a current or former president was convicted of a felony charge.","summary":"Ballots will be mailed in North Carolina starting on Friday, Sept. 6.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/first-2024-election-mail-ballots-scheduled-to-go-out-this-week-5716667","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/16/id5706854-Harris-Trump-LSedit-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 21:36:37","author":"Jack Phillips","authors":["Jack Phillips"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.46},{"id":255410214,"title":"Not even Kamala Harris’ biggest fans can say what the flip-flopping VP stands for","text":"Supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris are rallying behind her campaign despite admitting that they are can’t say where she stands on most big issues – as the Democratic nominee continues to flip-flop on major policies. Harris, 59, has reversed her stances on energy issues, health care and illegal immigration since replacing President Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket, in an apparent effort to make herself more electable to moderates in key swing states. Harris’ abandoned policy positions include her pledges to eliminate private health insurance, decriminalize illegal border crossings, ban fracking for oil and natural gas, and ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035 — each of those made in 2019 when the then-California senator was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. In recent weeks, The Post has spoken to several swing-state voters who plan to cast ballots for Harris. The majority of them painted a vague picture of what the vice president stands for – “pro-choice” and “the environment.” But the main reason they’re backing Harris is because she is not former President Donald Trump. Immigration “I would say I believe she is more moderate? in terms of immigration. In the sense that she’s not like let’s let everyone in,” Aaliyah Dittman, a 20-year-old college student from Clarion County, Pa., told The Post when asked about Harris’ position on the border and immigration. “But I feel like she’s kind of similar to Biden,” Dittman, a first-time voter excited about Harris, added. “And that’s the difficult thing. As she is still the vice president, she has to pull herself apart from the administration and say this is what I stand for and maybe she hasn’t done a great job doing that.” (Harris previously supported decriminalizing crossing the border illegally, opposed Trump’s wall and oversaw Biden-Harris administration policies that let in more than 8 million migrants. Now, she says she’s for the wall and wants to hire more Border Patrol agents.) Dittman also recalled that Harris, at the Democratic National Convention, “talked about the border deal that Trump had told Republicans to shut down, and that she would bring that back.” A 28-year-old George Mason University librarian, who didn’t want to give her name, similarly couldn’t clearly define Harris’ stance on immigration and wasn’t hesitant to say the vice president flip-flopped on the issue. “I think she’s staying true to herself. Honestly, I can’t give you a well rounded answer, because I haven’t seen her flip-flop,” the employee at the Fairfax, Va., school said. “I haven’t been that invested in the news, but from what I’ve seen, knowing about her beginnings as attorney general of California to where she is now as vice president to presidential candidate — she has always seemed to stay true to herself, even though she changes her mind,” she added. “I think she really sees [illegal immigration] more as an opportunity for growth and development as in keeping in tune of what most Americans want.” Energy and the environment Harris supporters that spoke to The Post appeared skeptical that the vice president would do much to address the environment and admitted they were unclear about where she stood on the issue. “I don’t know that — environment isn’t really what I focus on,” Mckenna Anderson, a junior at the University of Michigan, told The Post. “My major is gender, so I’m not that up to date on environment issues in general,” Anderson said. “I know that her and Biden did the Alaska oil pipeline, which is not as pro-environment, I guess. So I don’t know exactly where she stands, but from what little I do know, she’s not like great on environment.” (Harris previously supported a ban on fracking and was an early sponsor of the $2 trillion Green New Deal. She has reversed course on the fracking ban, and has avoided mentioning the proposed climate legislation.) Anna Klein, a freshman from Flat Rock, Mich., studying statistics at the University of Michigan, suggested that Democrats usually pander to voters when they talk about the environment but that it wouldn’t dissuade her from voting for Harris. “I’m gonna be honest. I’m not so sure that like, she’s gonna do much about it,” Klein said. “She might talk about it and she might act like she’s going to do something, but like, even Biden said that he was gonna do a lot and I’m sure there were some policies that helped, but like, they always talk about it just to get people on their side and then they don’t really do much.” “I think the biggest issue right now is just whether or not we want a person with some sense of morality in office,” she argued. “I’m not really worried about certain issues.” Abortion Abortion policy was top of mind for several of the battleground staters that spoke with The Post, but few could articulate what Harris would actually do to expand reproductive rights as president. Anderson, the gender major from Michigan, described Harris as being, “definitely for more, like women’s health.” “She is pro-choice, I guess,” she added before admitting, “I definitely need to learn more [about Harris’ policies].” Klein, the statistics major from Michigan, gave a similar response when asked what Harris policies stood out. “I do very much agree with her pro-choice policies,” she said. “I probably can’t name them off the top of my head right now.” Dittman, the Pennsylvania college student, recalled, “Kamala said in one of her speeches that she would restore Roe” — referring to the overturned case that legalized abortion across the US. The Keystone State native noted that reproductive rights are among her two “core values” with the other being “gun safety.” Does policy even matter? Dittman told The Post that while the DNC was light on policy talk she was pleased with the “messaging” and hoped Harris would get more specific during her Sept. 10 debate against Trump. “She needs to start that messaging now,” Dittman said, noting that she likes following the “fun” and “relatable” Kamala HQ X account but that “maybe it would be a good idea to expand on policy.” “I really hope she hits hard on policy at the debate, because I feel like the debate, Trump is going to ramble on whatever he’s going to ramble on about and I feel like Kamala, at least I’m hoping, has the answers and her policy ready,” she added. Brandyn Fragosa, a 20-year-old communications major from Stafford, Va., studying at George Mason University, indicated that he plans to vote for Harris in November regardless of where the vice president stands on policy issues. “I will be voting for Kamala Harris, because I just feel like she, her beliefs align with my beliefs,” he said. Fragosa couldn’t identify a single policy stance from Harris that stood out to him, but said he plans to do “more research” even though it won’t change his vote. “At the moment, it’s more just about, OK, I know what Trump believes in, and I know that doesn’t align with what I believe in,” he said. “I know she was working underneath the Biden administration as the vice president, and I knew most of the things that they followed and believed in were stuff that I believed in.” Like Fragosa, Kyle Woody, an 18-year-old psychology major from Ashburn, Va., studying at George Mason University, also said that he didn’t ”know too much about the policies” of Harris but that it likely won’t play much of a role in how he votes. “I just don’t think Trump’s a good person,” Woody said. Even more seasoned voters told The Post that policy wasn’t playing a major role in their ballot box decisions this election cycle. In Las Vegas, Nev., Craig Wuest, a former Pentagon expert on nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs, said he believes Trump “is the greatest threat to democracy that I have seen in my career.” To Wuest, that, more than Harris’s policies, motivated his vote. Pastor Tanesha Jordan Roberts of Las Vegas’ Greater Grace Global Church, said she is a registered Republican but did not vote for “the top of the ticket” for several elections until 2020 when she pulled the lever for Biden. “I believe we just need to get back to politics being boring,” Roberts told The Post. “I probably won’t agree on 90% of what she’s putting forth. But this is not a policy decision. This is about our democracy. This is about the rule of law. This is about our way out of the crazy that we are in.” — Additional reporting by Ethan Dodd and Mark A.

It's the latest volley in an extended back and forth as Trump tries to saddle Harris with the Biden administration's handling of the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, including a suicide bombing that killed 13 U.S. service members. Harris on Saturday accused Trump of staging a “political stunt” that “disrespected sacred ground\" where many Afghanistan war dead are buried. Trump and the families of some of those killed in the bombing blame Harris, as they did President Joe Biden before he ended his reelection bid, for their loved ones' deaths. The families say the former president was honoring their loved ones when he came to Arlington. His campaign later distributed images of the visit despite the cemetery's prohibition on partisan activity on the grounds. “President Trump was invited by us, the Gold Star families, to attend the solemn ceremonies commemorating the three-year anniversary of our children's deaths,” said the relatives' joint statement. “He was there to honor their sacrifice, yet Vice President Harris has disgracefully twisted this sacred moment into a political ploy.” Gold Star families have lost a loved one in military service. Trump laid wreaths last Monday in honor of Sgt. Nicole Gee, Staff Sgt. Darin Hoover and Staff Sgt. Ryan Knauss. They were among 13 U.S. service members and more than 100 Afghans who died in an Aug. 26, 2021, bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport as U.S. forces withdrew from Afghanistan. Trump thanked the family members for their statement via social media. “Thank you for saying you wanted me to stand with you ... and take pictures, that it was your request, not mine,” he wrote. Throughout the weekend, Trump has used his social media accounts to distribute video testimonials from some relatives who signed the joined the statement. Christy Shamblin, Gee's mother-in-law, said in a 90-second message that Trump and his aides were “respectful” and a “a comfort” to the families who gathered at Arlington. Then she directly addressed her remarks to Harris. “Why won't you return a call and explain how you call my daughter-in-law's death a success?” Shamblin said. “Why would you take a day where we celebrated the deaths of our loved ones and use it to disparage not only them, but us.” Biden and first lady Jill Biden went to Dover Air Force Base in 2021 for the ceremony returning the service members' remains to U.S. soil. The Bidens met privately with family members at Dover. The Bidens were joined at the ceremony by several top aides in the administration, including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Shamblin was among the several family members who also spoke at the Republican National Convention in July on Trump's behalf. Several family members have joined Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, on a conference call with media. Trump's appearance ballooned into controversy after defense officials said his campaign was warned about not taking photographs and that there was an altercation between Trump aides and a cemetery employee. Officials have said since that an employee whom two Trump campaign staff members allegedly “verbally abused and pushed” aside has declined to press charges. The Trump campaign has since lashed out at Pentagon officials, with a top campaign adviser, Chris LaCivita, referring to military spokespersons as “hacks.” Trump campaign officials say the campaign had permission to bring someone to take video. Since Biden ended his reelection bid in July, Trump has been zeroing in on Harris and her roles in foreign policy decisions. He has highlighted the vice president’s statements that she was the last person in the room before Biden made the decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. Biden’s administration was following a withdrawal commitment and timeline that the Trump administration had negotiated with the Taliban in 2020. A 2022 review by a government-appointed special investigator concluded decisions made by both Trump and Biden were the key factors leading to the rapid collapse of Afghanistan’s military and the Taliban takeover. Campaigning this year, Trump has said that leaving was the right thing to do but that the Biden administration's execution was poor. “We were going to do it with dignity and strength,” he said in a recent speech in Michigan. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Tim Walz, the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, walked away Sunday after being asked by a reporter what his “reaction” was to the news that the bodies of six Israeli hostages had been discovered in a Hamas tunnel underneath Gaza, including one American citizen. While at the Minnesota State Fair, Walz was asked “how much” had changed since the “last state fair,” and how Walz was “balancing managing” his role as governor and running for vice president. Walz, holding a vanilla milkshake, was then asked by a reporter about his “reaction” to the news that the bodies of six hostages held by Hamas had been found, to which he turned and walked away. “Thanks, everybody!” he said, to cheers from supporters. He ignored the question. Tim Walz was asked three questions at the state fair—the first two were superficial softballs. When asked about the six dead hostages in Gaza? *walks away*pic.twitter.com/26zjsTw01j — Dustin Grage (@GrageDustin) September 1, 2024 The brief exchange with reporters went as follows. “How much has changed from the last state fair?” a reporter asked. “The question was, how much has changed from the last state fair,” Walz said. “I don’t get 12 days, which I normally get. A little bit more of a disruption, and I’m more concerned — obviously disruption to the other folks. But, it’s exciting. I think people are seeing that we’re getting to talk about Minnesota across the country, talk about the economy here, talk about things like the state fair, talk about agriculture.” “How are you balancing managing the state of Minnesota and running for [vice] president?” another reporter asked Walz. “I’ve got a good team on the – being able to manage my schedule,” Walz answered. “We appointed three great judges last week in Ramsey County, as you saw. Every night we go through all of the decision memos and meeting with the commissioners. I stay updated throughout the day and I’m in and out — most of my time is day out and then back in.” “What’s your reaction to the six hostages being found dead in Gaza?” another reporter asked Walz. “Alright, thanks everybody,” Walz said as he began to turn and walk away. Walz’s non-answer to the question comes after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) identified the six murdered hostages as being Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, U.S. citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, and Ori Danino. Ynet News reported that the autopsies of the six hostages’ bodies showed that they had sustained “gunshot wounds to their head and other areas”: All six hostages whose bodies were discovered and recovered from Gaza on Sunday were found with gunshot wounds to their head and other areas, their autopsies showed. According to the post-mortem, they were executed no more than 48 hours before being found and signs of neglect in captivity were found on their bodies. Except for one of the hostages, who showed signs of being bound, no evidence of torture was found. However, the condition of their bodies indicated systematic neglect, including a lack of hygiene over a long period. Additionally, indications were present of previous injuries sustained during their abduction, which had been treated over time. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris issued statements in response to the murders. In his statement, Biden said that “Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes,” while adding that he had “worked tirelessly” to bring American-Israel hostage Goldberg-Polin home. (Bide has been on vacation for two weeks.) Harris noted that her “prayers” were with Rachel Goldberg-Polin and her husband Jon Polin, and described Hamas as being “an evil terrorist organization.”","summary":"Minnesota Gov.

She specifically expressed concerns over Walz’s connection to China and communism, including visiting the country about 30 times in the past. “I’m 100% convinced he’s a national security risk,” Noem said on Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo, guest-hosted by Sean Duffy. “This man wants America to grow up and be more like China, which is the exact opposite of what our leaders should be doing. I have spent all of my time fighting China, and for 30 years I’ve been working in policy on protecting our food supply, and we’ve seen China not only manipulate our currency, steal our IP, treat us unfairly in trade agreements. They’ve also spied on us, they’ve come in and now and they’re taking and buying our land.” Noem added that the rest of the country needs to “wake up” and realize that neither Walz nor Vice President Kamala Harris should be in the White House. She then made a call to elect people who will want to protect the country from socialism, and concluded, “That’s not Tim Walz.” The South Dakota governor also claimed she has seen “tens of thousands” of people leave Minnesota for South Dakota due to Walz’s leadership. She argued that Walz has “crippled” Minnesota residents and the state’s economy, and these residents are seeking greener pastures in other states. Noem’s comments on people leaving Walz’s state mirror what Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) said about the Minnesota governor last month.

Tom Cotton and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. The two were speaking about former President Donald Trump's visit last week to Arlington National Cemetery, where he has drawn criticism for posing for photos with Gold Star families in a section of the cemetery where photos are traditionally prohibited. Last week, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Trump’s visit was a “personal invitation by families.” “There are many ways that we as a nation and our leaders can observe the third anniversary of Abbey Gate,” Kirby said. “Another way is to continue to work, maybe not with a lot of fanfare, maybe not with a lot of public attention, maybe not with TV cameras, but to work every single day to make sure that the families of the fallen and of those who were injured and wounded — not just at Abbey Gate but over the course of the 20-some-odd years that we were in Afghanistan — have the support that they need.” The Army also accused a member of Trump's campaign staff of \"abruptly push[ing] aside\" a cemetery staff member who sought to enforce restrictions on taking photos and video at the location. Asked about the incident Sunday on NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" Cotton, R-Ark., told moderator Kristen Welker: \"These families, Gold Star families, whose children died because of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’ incompetence invited [Trump] to the cemetery and they asked him to take those photos. ... You know who the families also invited? Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Where were they? Joe Biden was sitting at a beach. Kamala Harris was sitting at her mansion in Washington, D.C.\" Cotton said he spoke to Kelly Barnett and Darin Hoover, the parents of Marine Staff Sgt. Darin Taylor Hoover, who died in Afghanistan three years ago. Cotton didn't specify whether they were the family members he claimed invited Biden and Harris. Gabbard, a former Democratic House member from Hawaii, echoed Cotton, telling CNN on Sunday: \"President Biden and Harris, I heard, were invited by some of these family members. They not only didn’t come; they didn’t even respond to that invitation.\" Trump last week defended the photos and videos he took at the cemetery, telling NBC News in Michigan on Thursday that a Gold Star family \"asked me whether or not I would stand for a picture at the grave of their loved one who should not have died.” He said he didn’t initiate the photo, adding: “While I was there, I didn’t ask for a picture. While I was there, they said, ‘Sir, could we have a picture at the grave?’\" Trump's campaign posted a TikTok video of the ceremony, and Trump campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita posted a video on X of Trump laying flowers at a grave. Trump defended that on Thursday, too, saying, \"Well, we have a lot of people ... TikTok people.\" \"I don't know who did it, and it could have been them. It could have been the parents. It could have been somebody,\" he added. On Friday, at a rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Trump said: “Joe Biden killed those young people because he was incompetent. And then they tell me that I use their graves for public relations services, and I didn’t.\" Trump took to X on Saturday night, posting multiple videos of relatives of killed service members defending him and criticizing Harris and Biden. In one video, Darin Hoover addresses Harris directly, saying Trump treated the family with the \"utmost respect\" and asking where she and Biden were on \"Aug. 26, 2024.\" He said they were \"nowhere near Arlington Cemetery. You couldn’t be bothered to be with us or say our kids' names.” In a statement accompanying the Trump campaign videos Sunday, members of the Gold Star families said they were \"appalled\" by Harris' attempts to \"politicize\" Trump's visit to the cemetery. \"President Trump was invited by us, the Gold Star families, to attend the solemn ceremonies commemorating the three-year anniversary of our children’s deaths,\" the statement said. \"He was there to honor their sacrifice, yet Vice President Harris has disgracefully twisted this sacred moment into a political ploy.\" The videos were posted in response Harris' statement Saturday saying Trump \"disrespected sacred ground\" during his visit to Arlington National Cemetery, in the Virginia suburbs of Washington.

In an interview with Pavel Zarubin, a TV reporter with favored access to the Kremlin, Peskov also appeared dismissive of Trump’s boast that he could end the Ukraine war within 24 hours if U.S. voters returned him to the White House. Before Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from November’s election and threw his support behind Harris, Russian President Vladimir Putin had said that Moscow preferred Biden over Trump, describing the former as an experienced “old school” type of politician. With Biden out of the running, Zarubin asked Peskov, laughing: “Then who is our candidate now?” Peskov, also laughing, replied: “We have no candidate. But, of course, the Democrats are more predictable. And what Putin said about Biden’s predictability applies to almost all Democrats, including Ms. Harris.” While stating that the election was an internal U.S. matter, Putin and Peskov have offered a variety of opinions at different times. In February, for example, Putin praised Biden for his predictability but also discussed the sensitive topic of his mental fitness for office in comments that appeared designed to sow mischief. In June, he said Russia did not care who the next U.S. president was, but that the U.S. court system was clearly being used in a political battle against Trump. Peskov, in the interview published on Sunday, said U.S. steps to “trample on our country’s interests” had exceeded acceptable limits. Bilateral relations were at a historic low point, with “no prospects” at the moment of setting them on a path towards recovery. The Kremlin spokesman said there was no “magic wand” to resolve the Ukraine crisis overnight in the way that Trump has promised. He said it was “fantasy” to imagine that the next U.S. president would announce in their inauguration speech that Washington was halting military aid to Ukraine and calling for peace negotiations, and that this would change mindsets in Kyiv.","summary":"Russia sees U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris as a more predictable opponent than Republican Donald Trump, though in any case there is no prospect of an improvement in relations with Washington, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/09/01/breaking-news/kremlin-spokesman-says-harris-is-more-predictable-than-trump/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/web1_2024-09-01T133447Z_1_LYNXMPEK800GX_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-RUSSIA.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 20:53:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.34},{"id":255408946,"title":"Teamsters Chief Wants to Meet with Kamala Harris","text":"Taegan Goddard is the founder of Political Wire, one of the earliest and most influential political web sites.

In the statement shared on Sunday, the Gold Star families – who have lost a loved one in military service – defended the Republican presidential nominee and insisted that Vice President Kamala Harris was the candidate politicizing fallen US service members. Some family members also recorded video messages that the former president posted on Truth Social, saying Trump was honoring their loved ones when he came to Arlington. The Republican presidential nominee has been facing fierce backlash over Monday’s visit, where campaign staffers allegedly physically shoved a female worker and then disrespected fallen soldiers and veterans’ families by defying the rules to film and take photos in a banned area. On Saturday, Harris accused Trump of staging a “political stunt” that “disrespected sacred ground” where many Afghanistan war dead are buried when his campaign released images of his visit — including the Republican nominee standing giving thumbs up by the graves of fallen soldiers. Partisan activity is prohibited on cemetery grounds. The same day, President Joe Biden told reporters when asked about the incident: “I don’t want to answer because I might tell you what I think.” To deflect from the furor, the former president has ramped up his rhetoric in recent days seeking to directly link Harris to the Biden administration’s handling of the US’s exit from Afghanistan in 2021 after 20 years of occupation. The service members who died on August 26 2021, were killed by a suicide bomber at the Abbey Gate of Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport. Trump and the families of some of those killed in the bombing blame Harris, as they did Biden before he ended his reelection bid, for their loved ones’ deaths, slamming her role in foreign policy decisions, and highlighting a statement she made that she was the last person in the room before Biden made the decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. “President Trump was invited by us, the Gold Star families, to attend the solemn ceremonies commemorating the three-year anniversary of our children’s deaths,” said the relatives’ joint statement. “He was there to honor their sacrifice, yet Vice President Harris has disgracefully twisted this sacred moment into a political ploy.” Trump laid wreaths last Monday in honor of Sgt Nicole Gee, Staff Sgt Darin Hoover and Staff Sgt Ryan Knauss. He posted video testimonials from their family members and thanked them for their statement via social media: “Thank you for saying you wanted me to stand with you ... and take pictures, that it was your request, not mine.” Christy Shamblin, Gee’s mother-in-law, said in a 90-second message that Trump and his aides were “respectful” and a “a comfort” to the families who gathered at Arlington. Then she directly addressed her remarks to Harris. “Why won’t you return a call and explain how you call my daughter-in-law’s death a success?” Shamblin said. “Why would you take a day where we celebrated the deaths of our loved ones and use it to disparage not only them, but us.” Shamblin was among the several family members who also spoke at the Republican National Convention in July on Trump’s behalf. Others have joined Trump’s running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, on a conference call with media. Biden and first lady Jill Biden went to Dover Air Force Base in 2021 for the ceremony returning the service members’ remains to US soil and met privately with the family members there. Allies of the former president also jumped to defend him in appearances on the Sunday morning political shows, with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina telling ABC News: “You know what really is unfortunate? That these families had to go visit their fallen loved ones at Arlington due to incompetence by the Biden administration.” Trump’s visit to the cemetery is controversial because defense officials said his campaign was warned about not taking photographs. There was also an altercation between Trump aides and a cemetery employee when the staff member tried to tell them not to film or take photos. Officials have said since that an employee whom two Trump campaign staff members allegedly “verbally abused and pushed” aside has declined to press charges. In response, the Trump campaign lashed out at Pentagon officials, with top campaign adviser Chris LaCivita referring to military spokespersons as “hacks” and claiming the campaign had prior permission to film at the site. The Afghanistan withdrawal came in respect to a commitment and timeline that the Trump administration had negotiated with the Taliban in 2020. A 2022 review by a government-appointed special investigator concluded decisions made by both Trump and Biden were the key factors leading to the rapid collapse of Afghanistan’s military and the Taliban takeover.

The workers' union decision came several hours after the IDF announced the recovery of the bodies of six hostages from Rafah in southern Gaza.The announcement came amid nationwide protests, with thousands of people demanding the return of the hostages and condemning their abandonment. In Jerusalem, protesters gathered outside the security cabinet meeting and blocked the entrance to the city.The Hostage Family Forum reported that an estimated 300,000 people attended a demonstration in Tel Aviv, calling on the Israeli government to negotiate a deal to secure the return of the 101 remaining captives in Gaza.In Tel Aviv, massive crowds marched to a main stage outside the Kirya military headquarters, carrying coffins. There, they joined hundreds of thousands of others to hear speeches from hostage families and other speakers, reported NBC News.Family members of the hostages criticized the government and Prime Minister Netanyahu, including the brother of German-Israeli citizen Ohad Ben Ami. He expressed that he had hope for a deal until he heard the news about the six hostages who were killed, and now he feels \"broken.\"The teachers' union announced it would join the labor union's strike, stating that schools will only operate until 11:45 a.m. on Monday, except for special education schools, which will remain open as usual. In response, the Education Ministry declared that all teaching staff are required to work as normal.Israel's Business Forum, which represents 200 leaders of the country's largest companies, has joined the Hostages and Missing Families Forum in calling for protests. The forum urged the public not to remain passive in the face of daily loss of life and the abandonment of hostages, who, according to all security bodies, could have been rescued. As a gesture of solidarity with the hostage families, Lev Cinemas announced it would close its theaters starting at 5 p.m. on Sunday, as reported by N12.The six hostages recovered from Gaza were killed somewhere between Thursday and Friday, a spokesperson from Israel's health ministry said.Vice President Kamala Harris, along with her husband Doug Emhoff, spoke with the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, she wrote in a post on X. \"My heart breaks for their pain and anguish,\" Harris wrote. \"I told them: As they mourn this terrible loss, they are not alone.

In their letter, the officials added that Grok continued to repeat the false information for 10 days before it was corrected.\"As tens of millions of voters in the U.S. seek basic information about voting in this major election year, X has the responsibility to ensure all voters using your platform have access to guidance that reflects true and accurate information about their constitutional right to vote,\" the secretaries wrote in the letter, per the AP.","summary":"Mark Cuban raised a question to Elon Musk over the amount of votes to the amount of engagement a poll about Donald Trump and Kamala Harris received.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/mark-cuban-raises-question-donald-trump-kamala-harris-poll-1947282","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2462135/mark-cuban.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 20:28:29","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.206},{"id":255408450,"title":"Republican network boosts leftist third-party candidates in crucial states, aiming to divert votes from Harris","text":"WASHINGTON – Italo Medelius was leading a volunteer drive to put Cornel West on North Carolina’s presidential ballot last spring when he received an unexpected call from a man named Paul who said he wanted to help. Though Medelius, co-chairman of West’s “Justice for All Party,” welcomed the assistance, the offer would complicate his life, provoking threats and drawing him into a state election board investigation of the motivations, backgrounds and suspect tactics of his new allies. His is not an isolated case. Across the country, a network of Republican political operatives, lawyers and their allies is trying to shape November’s election in ways that favor former President Donald Trump. Their goal is to prop up third-party candidates such as West who offer liberal voters an alternative that could siphon away support from Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. It is not clear who is paying for the effort, but it could be impactful in states that were decided by miniscule margins in the 2020 election won by Democrat Joe Biden. This is money West’s campaign does not have, and he has encouraged the effort. Last month the academic told The Associated Press that “American politics is highly gangster-like activity” and he “just wanted to get on that ballot.” Trump has offered praise for West, calling him “one of my favorite candidates.” Another is Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Trump favors both for the same reason. “I like her very much. You know why? She takes 100% from them. He takes 100%.” Democrats are exploring ways to lift Randall Terry, an anti-abortion presidential candidate for the Constitution Party, believing he could draw voters from Trump. But the GOP effort appears to be more far-reaching. After years of Trump accusing Democrats of “rigging” elections, it is his allies who are now mounting a sprawling and at times deceptive campaign to tilt the vote in his favor. “The fact that either of the two major parties would attempt financially and otherwise to support a third-party spoiler candidate as part of its effort to win is an unfortunate byproduct” of current election laws “that facilitate spoilers,” said Edward B. Foley, a law professor who leads Ohio State University’s election law program. “This phenomenon is equally problematic whichever of the two major party engages in it.” One key figure in the push is Paul Hamrick, the man on the other end of the call with Medelius in North Carolina. Hamrick serves as counsel for the Virginia-based nonprofit People Over Party, which has pushed to get West on the ballot in Arizona, Maine, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Virginia, as well as North Carolina, records show. In an interview, Hamrick declined to say who else besides him was orchestrating the effort and he would not divulge who was funding it. He vigorously disputed any suggestion that he was a Republican, but acknowledged that he was not a Democrat, either. His history is complex. Hamrick was chief of staff to former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman, a one-term Democrat who was booted from office in 2003 and later was convicted and sentenced to prison on federal bribery, conspiracy and mail fraud charges. Hamrick was charged alongside his former boss in two separate cases. One was dismissed and he was acquitted in the other. Though he insists he is not a Republican, Hamrick voted in Alabama’s Republican primary in 2002, 2006 and 2010, according to state voting records maintained by the political data firm L2. He was tapped briefly in 2011 to work for the Alabama state Senate’s Republican majority. And since 2015, according to federal campaign finance disclosures, he has contributed only to GOP causes, including $2,500 to the Alabama Republican Party and $3,300 to Georgia Rep. Mike Collins, a Republican who has trafficked in conspiracy theories. Hamrick denied that he voted in any Republican primaries, suggesting that the voting data was inaccurate. For years, he was a consultant for Matrix LLC, an Alabama firm known for its hardball approach. Matrix LLC was part of an effort in Florida to run “ghost candidates” against elected officials who had raised the ire of executives for Florida Power & Light, the state’s largest utility. Daniella Levine Cava, the current mayor of Miami-Dade County, was a target. As a county commissioner, Levine Cava had fought with FPL. When she ran for reelection in 2018, Matrix covertly financed a third-party candidate they hoped would siphon enough votes to tip her seat to a Republican challenger, The Miami Herald reported in 2022. Hamrick was deeply involved. A company he created paid the spoiler candidate a $60,000 salary and rented a $2,300-a-month home for him, according to the newspaper and business filings made in Alabama. Hamrick said the candidate worked for him to help recruit business. Hamrick denied having anything to do with the man’s campaign. Either way, it did not work. Levine Cava was reelected before winning the mayor’s seat in 2020. Now Hamrick is playing a prominent role to place West’s name on the ballot in competetive states. Hamrick surfaced in Arizona two weeks ago after a woman told the AP that a document was fraudulently submitted in her name to Arizona’s secretary of state in which she purportedly agreed to serve as an elector for West. She said her signature was forged and she never agreed to be an elector. After the AP published her account, Hamrick said he spoke to the woman’s husband, trying to rectify the situation and “gave some information.” Hamrick declined to say what information was shared. He also tried to persuade another elector who backed out to recommit to West, according to interviews and voicemails. The next day, with the deadline to qualify for the Arizona ballot just hours away, Brett Johnson, a prominent Republican lawyer, and Amanda Reeve, a former GOP state lawmaker, made house visits to each as they tried to persuade both to sign new paperwork to serve as West electors. Johnson and Reeve work for Snell & Wilmer, which has done $257,000 worth of business for the Republican National Committee over the past two years, campaign finance disclosures show. West did not qualify for the Arizona ballot. Other Republican-aligned law firms also have been involved in the national push, opposing Democrat-backed challenges to West’s placement on the ballot: — In Georgia, Bryan Tyson, a partner at the Election Law Group, represented the state Republican Party as it tried to keep West on the ballot. The firm has collected $60,000 in payments from the RNC since April, campaign finance records show. Tyson did not respond to a request for comment. On Thursday, Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger overruled an administrative law judge and placed West, Stein and Party for Socialism and Liberation nominee Claudia De la Cruz on the ballot. Tyson did not respond to a message seeking comment. — In North Carolina, Phil Strach, a member of the Republican National Lawyers Association, successfully challenged in court a North Carolina State Board of Elections decision to bar West from the ballot. Strach did not respond to a message left for him. — In Michigan, John Bursch, a senior lawyer for the Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative legal group that helped overturn Roe v. Wade, successfully fended off a challenge to West’s placement on the ballot. Bursch’s firm, Bursch Law PLLC, was paid $25,000 by Trump’s campaign in November 2020 for “RECOUNT: LEGAL CONSULTING,” according to campaign finance disclosures. Bursch did not respond to a request for comment. — In Pennsylvania, a lawyer with long-standing ties to Republican candidates and causes, unsuccessfully argued in August for West to stay on the ballot. The attorney, Matt Haverstick, declined to say in an interview who hired him or why. People Over Party, the group Hamrick is affiliated with, had tried to get West on the ballot. None of these actions was funded by West’s campaign, though he and his “Justice for All” party have coordinated at times with Hamrick’s People Over Party, according to legal filings, a news release and social media posts. In North Carolina, People Over Party, worked with Blitz Canvassing and Campaign & Petition Management — two firms that routinely work for the GOP — to gather signatures for West. Hamrick later responded in writing on behalf of workers for the two companies after the state election board opened its inquiry. Jefferson Thomas, a longtime Republican operative from Colorado, submitted petition signatures that his firm, The Synapse Group, gathered on behalf of Stein in New Hampshire, records show. He did not respond to requests for comment. In Wisconsin, Blair Group Consulting oversaw West’s petition signature drive to qualify for the ballot, as previously reported by USA Today. David Blair, the firm’s president, was a the national director of Youth for Trump during the 2016 campaign and was a spokesman in the Trump administration. Blair declined to comment. Mark Jacoby, whose signature gathering firm Let the Voters Decide often works for Republicans, was involved in the failed Arizona push to get West on the ballot. The California operative has was convicted in 2009 of voter registration fraud, court records show. Jacoby did not respond to a message left at a phone number listed to him. Medelius, the North Carolina co-chairman of West’s “Justice for All Party,” said the partisan battles over third-party candidates amounted to a “gang war.” “If they want to use us for cannon fodder, there’s not much I can do about it,” he said. ___ Associated Press writers Jonathan J.

Flanked by her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and taking friendly questions from CNN’s Dana Bash, Harris consistently sought to portray herself as a middle-of-the road Democrat, although she gave scant details on specific policies she would pursue. And while this interview may not completely quiet complaints that Harris has avoided the media, it was, on balance, a good job. Moreover, Harris’ commitment to put a Republican in her Cabinet was a clever appeal to Republican-leaning Independents who may be wary of a second Trump term but are concerned that a Harris administration would be too far to the political left. Put another way, Harris mostly accomplished everything she needed to. She can now say that she’s sat for a major interview, and she did nothing that would curtail her momentum ahead of the September 10th debate, which will be much more influential in voters’ minds. Assisted by relatively little pushback or follow up from Bash, Harris avoided responding to questions about her history of flip-flopping on issues like fracking and border security – simply saying, “my values have not changed.” That was a line Harris repeated often, clearly hoping that it was opaque enough to brush aside concerns among moderates that her administration would take a far-left turn, without alienating the party’s progressive wing. Of course, politicians – like anyone – can see their positions on issues evolve as time goes on, but Harris’ history of flip-flopping is a considerable vulnerability for her campaign, and Harris did little to address those concerns. That being said, a politician’s job is to win, and Harris was undoubtedly trying to tack to the center, speaking to swing voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, and a handful of other swing states. Her reversal on fracking and decision to conduct the interview in Savannah in particular were likely aimed at swing voters in two states – Pennsylvania and Georgia – that Biden narrowly won in 2020, and she must win in November. When it came to President Biden and the Biden-Harris administration’s record, Harris offered a strong defense of Biden the man, yet mostly avoided attempting to defend the administration’s record, as well has her role in it. Making the case that history will show Biden’s presidency to be “transformative” and pledging to build on Biden’s agenda, Harris went to great lengths to avoid committing to any specific policies she would continue, or where she would break from the president. And, when pressed on her defense of Biden amid questions over the president’s competency for a second term, Harris refused to answer, instead lavishing praise on Biden’s “intelligence,” “judgment,” and “disposition.” Similarly, Harris sidestepped questions on whether “Bidenomics” was a success, pointing to the latest sub-3% inflation report, without noting that the average annual inflation during Biden’s presidency has been nearly double, at 5.7%, or that prices are cumulatively up nearly 20% since Biden and Harris took office. On foreign policy – specifically the war in the Middle East which has divided Democrats – Harris toed the Biden administration’s line, repeating her support for Israel’s right to self-defense but criticizing the toll of the war in Gaza and her support for a two-state solution. To be sure, Harris’ tactic of avoiding direct answers to her shifting positions, as well as her ties to an unpopular administration should be openings for the Trump campaign. Whether portraying Harris as a political chameleon or tying her to the Biden-Harris administration’s record, there are a myriad of ways Trump could make the case that a Harris administration would really be a second Biden term, which voters made clear they do not want. Thus far however, he has been unable to make a coherent argument, resorting to ad hominem attacks. that, “America will never allow an Election WEAPONIZING MARXIST TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S.” It should be clear, given Harris’ lead in many national and swing state polls, that these attacks are not effective, yet it has not stopped the former president from doubling down. Ultimately, Kamala Harris’ first interview as a presidential candidate should be seen in the context of a campaign strategy that seeks to turn the race into a personality contest, which Harris would almost certainly win. And while this interview alone likely did very little to sway voters, it also did nothing to harm what has, to this point, been a successful strategy.

Following much back and forth, Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump have both finally agreed to a September 10 debate. On Saturday, the Democratic candidate publicly called for Trump to agree that the mics be kept on at all times throughout the event. “Donald Trump is surrendering to his advisors who won’t allow him to debate with a live microphone,” Harris said in a tweet on Saturday. “If his own team doesn’t have confidence in him, the American people definitely can’t. We are running for President of the United States. Let’s debate in a transparent way—with the microphones on the whole time.” According to ABC News, Trump’s campaign has agreed to the following rules: no audience members; no opening statements; two minute closing statements; no props or pre written notes on stage; candidate microphones will be live only for the candidate whose turn it is to speak, and muted when time belongs to another candidate, and candidates will not be able to ask questions of each other. Harris’ team has not yet agreed to the rules, the outlet reported. On Fox News Sunday, Lewandowski hit out at Harris, saying that the parameters of the debate had been agreed back when President Joe Biden was still the Democratic party’s nominee – and that Harris, as the VP pick, was part of that. Lewandowski said she knew of the debate rules ahead of time because they are the same for the vice presidential debate. “After she has been coronated to be the presidential nominee for the Democrats, what she’s done is come back and said I don’t like that criteria anymore,” he claimed. “I want to be seated so I can be the same height as Donald Trump,” he said. Bream interjected, saying: “Okay, her team denies that.” Lewandowski grew visibly frustrated and launched into a rant hitting out at Harris and her team. “We’ve been part of the negotiation back and forth for many, many days here and I don’t understand why once again Kamala Harris and her team are changing what their positions have been,” he said. Elsewhere in the interview, Lewandowski also pushed the false claim that Democrats are in favor of abortion after a baby is born, also known as infanticide. “Kamala Harris … has had a radical position on the issue of abortion,” Lewandowski said. “Many Democrats believe that you can have an abortion not only on up until the last week, but also in some cases after the baby’s been born.” Bream fact checked Lewandowski on his statement. “To be clear, in a number of states, there is abortion allowed through pregnancy. And that includes a measure that Governor Tim Walz signed in Minnesota,” she said. “But Democrats say they absolutely disavow the idea of infanticide or of a baby that does survive an abortion somehow their life being taken at that point. We can continue that debate, because there are a number of states that do allow it through pregnancy. But I think everybody agrees infanticide is illegal and wrong.” The Independent has emailed both the Trump and Harris campaigns for comment.","summary":"Corey Lewandowski pushed the false claims that Democrats are in favor of abortion after a baby is born, also known as infanticide","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-lewandowski-fox-news-infanticide-abortion-debate-mics-b2605320.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/31/15/SEI219322298.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 20:06:57","author":"Michelle Del Rey","authors":["Michelle Del Rey"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.226},{"id":255407612,"title":"Trump Surrogates Play Hardball As Arlington Controversy Rages On","text":"Donald Trump's allies and surrogates are quickly falling in line to defend the former president’s controversial visit to Arlington National Cemetery after Kamala Harris accused the GOP candidate of disrespecting “sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt.” During a Sunday appearance on CNN's State of the Union, former Democratic congresswoman and current Trump acolyte Tulsi Gabbard described Trump's trip to the cemetery—and Section 60 specifically— as a “very grave and somber remembrance and honoring of those lives that were lost.” The Republican presidential nominee was invited to a wreath laying ceremony by the family of fallen Marine Staff Sgt.

The Hollywood powerhouse fawned over Biden while brushing aside the furious behind-the-scenes and sometimes cringe-worthy public “machinations” — including by Clooney himself — that led up to the president caving. “The person who should be applauded is the president, who did the most selfless thing that anybody’s done since George Washington,” Clooney said in a nod to the nation’s first commander in chief, who stepped aside after his second term, when asked about his Times essay during an interview at the Venice Film Festival. “All the machinations that got us there, none of that’s gonna be remembered, and it shouldn’t be,” the 63-year-old actor and director added, according to Entertainment Weekly. There had been a unified effort from high-ranking members of the Democratic Party, including Nancy Pelosi, to push him out of the presidential race in July after his devastating debate performance against GOP foe Donald Trump. Numerous members of Hollywood and the left-wing media such as Clooney joined in on the effort with a series of carefully placed public comments and essays. But Clooney, whose own essay was titled “I love Joe Biden, but We Need a New Nominee,” said Sunday that he didn’t want all that to become what history remembers. “What should be remembered is the selfless act of someone who … you know, it’s very hard to let go of power. We know that. We’ve seen it all around the world,” he said. “And for someone to say, ‘I think there’s a better way forward,’ all the credit goes to him, and that’s really the truth,” Clooney said of Biden. In his July essay, Clooney voiced his longtime support and admiration for Biden but said that after the president’s debate against Trump, there was no ignoring the toll age had taken on the president. “The one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe ‘big F-ing deal’ Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,” Clooney wrote in the Times. “Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw. “Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020.

In Biden’s first interview since he exited the race — paving the way for Veep Kamala Harris to take his place — he name-dropped Pelosi while saying he was pushed out by party elites. He added that House and Senate members running their own re-election campaigns decided he’d become a liability to their own futures. “A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the races. And I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic — you’d be interviewing me about why did Nancy Pelosi say [something] … and I thought it’d be a real distraction,” Biden told “CBS News Sunday Morning” earlier this month.","summary":"George Clooney on Sunday compared Joe Biden to George Washington in his first remarks since writing a bombshell New York Times op-ed calling on the 81-year-old prez to drop his re-election bid.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/01/us-news/clooney-compares-biden-to-george-washington-dodges-own-role-in-forcing-prez-from-race/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/88744928-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/3T9yYO4H-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-01 19:57:33","author":"Alex Oliveira","authors":["Alex Oliveira"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":255408112,"title":"Trump’s IVF proposal divides Maga loyalists and conservatives","text":"Donald Trump’s new proposal for the government or insurance companies to be mandated to pay for in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment for Americans has already divided the Republican party – with two GOP senators giving opposing stances on the matter on Sunday. The ex-president has been trying to navigate the post-Roe landscape since 2022, with limited success. As his presidential campaign has progressed throughout 2024, Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for appointing Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn federal protections on abortion — while he has simultaneously sought to distance himself from hardline opponents of abortion who are seeking to ban IVF and other fertility treatments, as well as the stricter end of GOP-led proposals to ban abortion at various points during the pregnancy. Over the past week, the former president made his latest attempt. Speaking to NBC News minutes before taking the stage in Potterville, Michigan, the ex-president made two announcements on the issue. First, he put forward a plan to force insurance companies or the federal government to cover the costs of IVF for all Americans. And second, he came out against Florida’s six-week abortion ban, which he said restricted abortion too early into the pregnancy. Campaign aides would clarify over the next few days that this did not mean he would support a ballot measure up for debate this year in Florida that would enshrine abortion access into the state constitution. Both statements triggered furious responses from within his own party. Anti-abortion groups and supporters of Florida’s conservative Governor Ron DeSantis ripped Trump for his supposed betrayal in statements to the press and on social media. And on Sunday, two Republican senators appearing in separate interviews across NBC and ABC took opposite positions on the pledge by Trump to fund IVF either through public or private means — suggesting that the plan will cause more internal divisions for the right as the general election nears. On NBC’s Meet the Press, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton — a MAGA populist — said that he could see himself supporting the former president’s plan and added that he thought “most Republicans” would be open to doing so. “It’s something I’m open to, that most Republicans would be open to,” he said, before adding that he would need to determine the “fiscal impact” of such a proposal first and consider “whether the taxpayer can afford to pay for this, what impact it would have on premiums.” He went on to claim that to his knowledge, no Republicans in Congress opposed the legality of IVF (a factually untrue statement, whether he knows it or not) and claimed that no state governments made fertility care “unaccessible” — though it was briefly blocked in Alabama earlier this year after a push by conservatives to extend the rights of a human being to unborn fetuses through the courts. That same strategy is being pushed by supporters of Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for reshaping the federal government, which is tied to numerous former Trump administration officials. “In principle, supporting couples who are trying to use IVF or other fertility treatments — I don’t think that’s controversial at all,” Cotton added. But the same morning that Cotton proclaimed Republicans would be open to Trump’s proposal, Lindsey Graham appeared on ABC’s This Week and immediately dimissed that idea. Trump, he argued, was trying to show his support for the practice of providing IVF treatments to families seeking to have children. The furthest Graham seemed prepared to go was a hypothetical tax credit for families undergoing IVF but he was firmly opposed to forcing insurance companies to directly fund the procedure. He added that it may be an issue on which Republicans could find “common ground” with Democrats. “I wouldn't [support that] because there's no end to that,” he said. “I think a tax credit for children makes sense, means tested.” “We’ve been accused — the party has — of being against birth control. We’re not. We’ve been accused of being against IVF treatments. We’re not,” Graham added as his explanation for Trump’s latest announcement. First, though, he’ll have to find common ground with the rest of his party. Graham remains the lead Senate supporter of efforts to restrict abortion at the national level — an idea the Trump campaign has repeatedly insisted the former president opposes. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate and Graham’s colleague in the Senate GOP caucus, echoed that opposition last week on NBC’s Meet the Press. Regardless of how GOP senators and members of Congress come out on the issue of funding for IVF over the next days or weeks, the Republican party will still have to contend with the push by the anti-abortion right to extend “personhood” rights to unborn fetuses through the court system. Many on the far right are looking at the conservative majority on the Supreme Court, which voted to overturn Roe v Wade in 2022, as the easiest vessel to achieve their goal of banning abortion and some fertility care nationwide without going through Congress. The Harris campaign continues to pummel Trump over the twin issues of abortion and IVF as well. Vice presidential nominee Tim Walz has talked about his own experiences seeking fertility treatments with his wife as Democrats have argued that Republicans are overreaching into Americans’ personal and private medical choices. “Donald Trump’s own platform could effectively ban IVF and abortion nationwide,” Sarafina Chitika, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, said on Thursday. “Trump lies as much if not more than he breathes, but voters aren’t stupid. Because Trump overturned Roe vs. Wade, IVF is already under attack and women’s freedoms have been ripped away in states across the country. There is only one candidate in this race who trusts women and will protect our freedom to make our own health care decisions: Vice President Kamala Harris.”","summary":"Senator Tom Cotton said he was ‘open’ to the plan while Senator Lindsey Graham quickly dismissed the idea","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-ivf-lindsey-graham-tom-cotton-b2605330.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/01/19/tomcotton_NBC.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VT51YucE-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-01 19:51:54","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.542},{"id":255406902,"title":"GOP Senate Incumbent Gets Worrying Sign in State Trump Won by 19 Points","text":"Senator Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican, has found herself in an unexpectedly tight race for reelection this year against independent candidate Dan Osborn, according to a new poll.The latest survey conducted between August 23 to 27 by SurveyUSA in partnership with Split Ticket shows the incumbent GOP senator leading Osborn by a mere single point, 39 to 38 percent. The poll, which was published on Saturday, surveyed 1,293 registered voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.This narrow margin comes as former President Donald Trump won the state by 19 percentage points in the 2020 election when he faced off against President Joe Biden. The poll results suggest that Nebraska, traditionally considered a Republican stronghold, may be more competitive than previously thought in the 2024 U.S. Senate race in November.Newsweek contacted Fischer and Osborn's press contact as well as Trump's campaign via email on Sunday for comment.The SurveyUSA poll is not an outlier. A YouGov poll conducted from July 31 to August 12 showed Fischer with a similarly slim 2-point lead (43 to 41 percent). Even more surprising, a November 2023 poll by Change Research had Osborn leading by 2 points (40 to 38 percent). However, a Torchlight Strategies poll from July showed Fischer with a more comfortable 26-point lead (50 to 24 percent)—highlighting the volatility of the race.Osborn, a former U.S. Navy veteran and labor union leader, has positioned himself as a centrist alternative to Fischer. His campaign strategy appears to be paying off, as he has managed to close the gap with the incumbent senator despite having lower name recognition. The SurveyUSA poll found that 42 percent of voters haven't heard anything about Osborn, indicating potential for further movement in the race.The Nebraska Democratic Party's decision not to field a candidate and instead tacitly support Osborn seems to be a calculated move that may be yielding dividends. This strategy mirrors the 2022 Utah Senate race where independent candidate Evan McMullin managed to keep the race surprisingly close against incumbent Republican Senator Mike Lee.Osborn's approach of distancing himself from both major parties appears to be resonating with voters across the political spectrum. The polls show him performing well not only in the more educated and urban 2nd Congressional District, but also overperforming in the exurban 1st District and rural 3rd District relative to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.The tight race in Nebraska could have significant implications for control of the Senate. With several competitive seats up for grabs this year, both parties are fighting for every possible advantage. A potential flip in Nebraska, which few considered possible at the outset of the Osborn campaign, could tip the balance of power in the upper chamber.Split-ticket voting has become increasingly rare in recent years. As reported by Axios, in the 2020 election, only one Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, won in a state that Trump lost. This trend suggests that Fischer may still have an advantage in a state that the former president won handily in 2020.","summary":"Nebraska's Deb Fischer faces a tight reelection race against independent Dan Osborn, defying the state's Republican lean.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/nebraska-senator-deb-fischer-worrying-sign-independent-dan-osborn-poll-1947273","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2462123/deb-fischer.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 19:44:02","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":255408024,"title":"Harris, Trump campaigns target workers on Labor Day","text":"Sept. 1 (UPI) -- On Labor Day, both presidential campaigns are focusing on workers with the election just 65 days away. Neither candidate has been on the campaign trail since Thursday with former President Trump in Pottersville, Mich. and Vice President Kamala Harris in Savannah, Ga. Harris will travel to Detroit on Monday before being joined by President Joe Biden in Pittsburgh as part of the Democrat's campaign's targeting working-class voters across battleground states. She last had a campaign event in Michigan on July 17 in Portage during the GOP Convention in Milwaukee. Trump won't be on the road but there will be a video call with current and retired members of the United Auto Workers. The union, which has endorsed Harris, has nearly a million active and retired members, including about 134,000 in Michigan. The Teamsters Union has said it is waiting for a private meeting with Harris before deciding which candidate to endorse in a race that polls show is extremely tight. There are 1.4 million Teamsters. Trump last spoke at a private event at a manufacturing plant, Alro Steel, in Pottersville, Mich., near the state capital Lansing. This was his eighth campaign stop in Michigan this year. Memorial Day typically signals the end of summer and the earnest beginning of the brass-tacks campaign season during presidential election years, and 2024 is likely to be even more intense given Biden's withdrawal from the race and Harris assuming the Democratic mantle. As it did in 2020, this year's race could boil down to a handful of swing states. Trump has been visiting the upper Midwest states that carried him to victory in 2016, but then cost him the election four years later in a loss to Biden. On Saturday, Trump has a rally planned in Mosinee, a small city in central Wisconsin. The first ballots will be mailed out this Friday in North Carolina, where Harris' running mate Tim Walz spent time on the campaign trail last week. On Sunday, the Minnesota governor was at the State Fair in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul. \"I think we know: Very difficult for a Republican presidential candidate to win the White House if they can't win North Carolina,\" Walz said Thursday during a stop at a campaign field office in Raleigh, according to CNN. In-person voting starts in Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia two weeks later. The Harris campaign also is investing time and money in Georgia and has spent more than $1.7 million in advertising money in the Savannah media market, according to data from the research company AdImpact. Her advisers have reported that Harris remains an underdog in the race despite holding a slight edge in some polls. The upcoming week will be critical to both camps as they intersperse time on the trail with preparing for the Sept. 10 debate in Philadelphia. With abortion a key issue in the race, Harris' \"Fighting for Reproductive Freedom\" bus tour will roll out Tuesday in Palm Beach, Fla., where Trump lives.","summary":"On Labor Day, both presidential campaigns are focusing on workers with the election just 65 days away.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/09/01/candidates-stump-in-crticial-labor-day-events/8291725216076/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/8291725216076/2024/upi/0961366a694a15a5775f8ff5639e5128/v1.2/Harris-Trump-campaigns-target-workers-on-Labor-Day.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 19:43:40","author":"Mark Moran","authors":["Mark Moran"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.06},{"id":255412656,"title":"Trump Surrogates Play Hardball As Arlington Controversy Rages On","text":"Donald Trump's allies and surrogates are quickly falling in line to defend the former president’s controversial visit to Arlington National Cemetery after Kamala Harris accused the GOP candidate of disrespecting “sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt.” During a Sunday appearance on CNN's State of the Union, former Democratic congresswoman and current Trump acolyte Tulsi Gabbard described Trump's trip to the cemetery—and Section 60 specifically— as a “very grave and somber remembrance and honoring of those lives that were lost.” The Republican presidential nominee was invited to a wreath laying ceremony by the family of fallen Marine Staff Sgt. Taylor Hoover to mark the third anniversary of a suicide bombing at Kabul airport during the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in 2021. Hoover was one of 13 American service-members killed in the attack on Abbey Gate at the airport's perimeter, where evacuees were being processed. Trump was accompanied by a photographer and other staffers. He was pictured giving a thumbs up and recording footage that was later shared on social media, behavior that upset other Gold Star families. (The former president took to TruthSocial on Sunday to defend these actions, posting a statement from the families that invited him to the cemetery which said they had asked his campaign to take photos and videos.) Electioneering and other partisan political activity at Arlington is against federal law; the former president’s campaign was made aware of this in advance of their visit. “Arlington National Cemetery reinforced and widely shared this law and its prohibitions with all participants,” a spokesperson for the memorial said. Gabbard, however, claimed Trump campaign was “approved to bring a camera there to document this historic and momentous day.” She did not specify who gave the alleged permission. Dodging questions about disgruntled families and cemetery policies, the former lawmaker pivoted to criticizing Trump’s opponent. “I know President Trump wanted to share (the anniversary) with others, especially given the fact that President Biden and Harris, I heard, were invited by some of these family members. They not only didn't come, they didn't even respond to that invitation,” she claimed. Neither Harris nor Biden have addressed allegations that they were invited to the ceremony on Aug. 26. Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) echoed Gabbard’s criticisms, slamming the Vice President—and current presidential candidate—for “politicizing” Trump’s visit to Arlington, and pinning the blame on her for the soldiers’ deaths. When the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, the Biden administration was following a withdrawal commitment and deadline negotiated by the Trump administration with the Taliban. “She was the last person in the room advising Joe Biden, and yet they're criticizing Donald Trump's invitation from those families at Arlington,” Stefanik said on Fox News. “Kamala Harris is a disgrace, and we need to make sure she never becomes commander in chief.”","summary":"Photo composite by Thomas Levinson/The Daily Beast/CNN/FOXDonald Trump's allies and surrogates are quickly falling in line to defend the former president’s controversial visit to Arlington National Cemetery after Kamala Harris accused the GOP candidate of disrespecting “sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt.”\n\nDuring a Sunday appearance on CNN's State of the Union, former Democratic congresswoman and current Trump acolyte Tulsi Gabbard described Trump's trip to the cemetery—and Section 60 specifically— as a “very grave and somber remembrance and honoring of those lives that were lost.”\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee was invited to a wreath laying ceremony by the family of fallen Marine Staff Sgt.

Tom Cotton and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. The two were speaking about former President Donald Trump’s visit to Arlington National Cemetery last week, where he has drawn criticism for posing for photos with Gold Star families in a section of the cemetery where photos are traditionally prohibited. Last week, White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said Trump’s visit was a “personal invitation by families.” “There are many ways that we as a nation and our leaders can observe the third anniversary of Abbey Gate,” Kirby said. “Another way is to continue to work, maybe not with a lot of fanfare, maybe not with a lot of public attention, maybe not with TV cameras, but to work every single day to make sure that the families of the fallen and of those who were injured and wounded — not just at Abbey Gate but over the course of the 20-some-odd years that we were in Afghanistan — have the support that they need.” The U.S. Army also accused a member of Trump’s campaign staff of “abruptly push[ing] aside” a cemetery staff member who sought to enforce restrictions on taking photos and video footage at the location. Cotton was asked about the incident on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” Sunday and told moderator Kristen Welker, “These families, Gold Star families, whose children died because of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’ incompetence invited [Trump] to the cemetery and they asked him to take those photos …You know who the families also invited? Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Where were they? Joe Biden was sitting at a beach. Kamala Harris was sitting at her mansion in Washington D.C.” Cotton mentioned that he spoke to Kelly Barnett and Darin Hoover, the parents of Staff Sgt. Darin Taylor Hoover, who died in Afghanistan three years ago. Cotton didn’t specify whether Barnett and Darin Hoover were the family members he claims extended an invitation to Biden and Harris. Gabbard echoed Cotton, telling CNN on Sunday, “President Biden and Harris, I heard, were invited by some of these family members. They not only didn’t come. They didn’t even respond to that invitation.” Trump earlier this week defended the photos and videos he took at the cemetery, telling NBC News in Michigan on Thursday that a Gold Star family, “asked me whether or not I would stand for a picture at the grave of their loved one who should not have died.” He said he didn’t initiate the photo, adding: “While I was there, I didn’t ask for a picture. While I was there, they said, ‘Sir, could we have a picture at the grave?’” Trump’s campaign posted a TikTok video of the ceremony and Trump’s campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita posted a video on X of the former president laying flowers at a grave. The former president defended that on Thursday too, saying, “Well, we have a lot of people … TikTok people.” “I don’t know who did it, and it could have been them. It could have been the parents. It could have been somebody,” he added. On Friday, during a rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Trump said “Joe Biden killed those young people because he was incompetent. And then they tell me that I use their graves for public relations services, and I didn’t.” Trump took to X Saturday night, posting multiple videos of family members of killed service members criticizing Harris and Biden and defending the former president. In one video, Darin Hoover addresses Harris directly saying Trump treated the family with the “utmost respect” and asked where the vice president and Biden were on “Aug. 26, 2024,” he added that they were “nowhere near Arlington Cemetery. You couldn’t be bothered to be with us or say our kid’s names.” In a statement accompanying the videos released by the Trump campaign Sunday members of the Gold Star families said they were “appalled” by Harris’s attempts to “politicize” Trump’s visit to the cemetery. “President Trump was invited by us, the Gold Star families, to attend the solemn ceremonies commemorating the three-year anniversary of our children’s deaths,” the statement said. “He was there to honor their sacrifice, yet Vice President Harris has disgracefully twisted this sacred moment into a political ploy.” The videos were posted in response to a statement Harris put out on Saturday saying that Trump “disrespected sacred ground” during his visit to Arlington National Cemetery.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were not invited to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: White House confirms families of service members killed in Afghanistan withdrawal did not invite Biden and Harris to Arlington Cemetery first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/white-house-confirms-families-of-service-members-killed-in-afghanistan-withdrawal-did-not-invite-biden-and-harris-to-arlington-cemetery/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-White-House-says-Biden-and-Harris-werent.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 19:37:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":255406502,"title":"GOP operatives prop up liberal third-party candidates to draw votes away from Kamala Harris","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Italo Medelius was leading a volunteer drive to put Cornel West on North Carolina’s presidential ballot last spring when he received an unexpected call from a man named Paul who said he wanted to help. Though Medelius, co-chairman of West’s “Justice for All Party,” welcomed the assistance, the offer would complicate his life, provoking threats and drawing him into a state election board investigation of the motivations, backgrounds and suspect tactics of his new allies. His is not an isolated case. Across the country, a network of Republican political operatives, lawyers and their allies is trying to shape November’s election in ways that favor former President Donald Trump. Their goal is to prop up third-party candidates such as West who offer liberal voters an alternative that could siphon away support from Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. It is not clear who is paying for the effort, but it could be impactful in states that were decided by miniscule margins in the 2020 election won by Democrat Joe Biden. This is money West’s campaign does not have, and he has encouraged the effort. Last month the academic told The Associated Press that “American politics is highly gangster-like activity” and he “just wanted to get on that ballot.” Trump has offered praise for West, calling him “one of my favorite candidates.” Another is Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Trump favors both for the same reason. “I like her very much. You know why? She takes 100% from them. He takes 100%.” Democrats are exploring ways to lift Randall Terry, an anti-abortion presidential candidate for the Constitution Party, believing he could draw voters from Trump. But the GOP effort appears to be more far-reaching. After years of Trump accusing Democrats of “rigging” elections, it is his allies who are now mounting a sprawling and at times deceptive campaign to tilt the vote in his favor. “The fact that either of the two major parties would attempt financially and otherwise to support a third-party spoiler candidate as part of its effort to win is an unfortunate byproduct” of current election laws “that facilitate spoilers,” said Edward B. Foley, a law professor who leads Ohio State University’s election law program. “This phenomenon is equally problematic whichever of the two major party engages in it.” One key figure in the push is Paul Hamrick, the man on the other end of the call with Medelius in North Carolina. Hamrick serves as counsel for the Virginia-based nonprofit People Over Party, which has pushed to get West on the ballot in Arizona, Maine, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Virginia, as well as North Carolina, records show. In an interview, Hamrick declined to say who else besides him was orchestrating the effort and he would not divulge who was funding it. He vigorously disputed any suggestion that he was a Republican, but acknowledged that he was not a Democrat, either. His history is complex. Hamrick was chief of staff to former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman, a one-term Democrat who was booted from office in 2003 and later was convicted and sentenced to prison on federal bribery, conspiracy and mail fraud charges. Hamrick was charged alongside his former boss in two separate cases. One was dismissed and he was acquitted in the other. Though he insists he is not a Republican, Hamrick voted in Alabama’s Republican primary in 2002, 2006 and 2010, according to state voting records maintained by the political data firm L2. He was tapped briefly in 2011 to work for the Alabama state Senate’s Republican majority. And since 2015, according to federal campaign finance disclosures, he has contributed only to GOP causes, including $2,500 to the Alabama Republican Party and $3,300 to Georgia Rep. Mike Collins, a Republican who has trafficked in conspiracy theories. Hamrick denied that he voted in any Republican primaries, suggesting that the voting data was inaccurate. For years, he was a consultant for Matrix LLC, an Alabama firm known for its hardball approach. Matrix LLC was part of an effort in Florida to run “ghost candidates” against elected officials who had raised the ire of executives for Florida Power & Light, the state’s largest utility. Daniella Levine Cava, the current mayor of Miami-Dade County, was a target. As a county commissioner, Levine Cava had fought with FPL. When she ran for reelection in 2018, Matrix covertly financed a third-party candidate they hoped would siphon enough votes to tip her seat to a Republican challenger, The Miami Herald reported in 2022. Hamrick was deeply involved. A company he created paid the spoiler candidate a $60,000 salary and rented a $2,300-a-month home for him, according to the newspaper and business filings made in Alabama. Hamrick said the candidate worked for him to help recruit business. Hamrick denied having anything to do with the man’s campaign. Either way, it did not work. Levine Cava was reelected before winning the mayor’s seat in 2020. Now Hamrick is playing a prominent role to place West’s name on the ballot in competetive states. Hamrick surfaced in Arizona two weeks ago after a woman told the AP that a document was fraudulently submitted in her name to Arizona’s secretary of state in which she purportedly agreed to serve as an elector for West. She said her signature was forged and she never agreed to be an elector. After the AP published her account, Hamrick said he spoke to the woman’s husband, trying to rectify the situation and “gave some information.” Hamrick declined to say what information was shared. He also tried to persuade another elector who backed out to recommit to West, according to interviews and voicemails. The next day, with the deadline to qualify for the Arizona ballot just hours away, Brett Johnson, a prominent Republican lawyer, and Amanda Reeve, a former GOP state lawmaker, made house visits to each as they tried to persuade both to sign new paperwork to serve as West electors. Johnson and Reeve work for Snell & Wilmer, which has done $257,000 worth of business for the Republican National Committee over the past two years, campaign finance disclosures show. Hamrick declined to comment on the role of Johnson and Reeve. They did not respond to requests for comment. West did not qualify for the Arizona ballot. Other Republican-aligned law firms also have been involved in the national push, opposing Democrat-backed challenges to West’s placement on the ballot: — In Georgia, Bryan Tyson, a partner at the Election Law Group, represented the state Republican Party as it tried to keep West on the ballot. The firm has collected $60,000 in payments from the RNC since April, campaign finance records show. Tyson did not respond to a request for comment. On Thursday, Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger overruled an administrative law judge and placed West, Stein and Party for Socialism and Liberation nominee Claudia De la Cruz on the ballot. Tyson did not respond to a message seeking comment. — In North Carolina, Phil Strach, a member of the Republican National Lawyers Association, successfully challenged in court a North Carolina State Board of Elections decision to bar West from the ballot. Strach did not respond to a message left for him. — In Michigan, John Bursch, a senior lawyer for the Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative legal group that helped overturn Roe v. Wade, successfully fended off a challenge to West’s placement on the ballot. Bursch’s firm, Bursch Law PLLC, was paid $25,000 by Trump’s campaign in November 2020 for “RECOUNT: LEGAL CONSULTING,” according to campaign finance disclosures. Bursch did not respond to a request for comment. — In Pennsylvania, a lawyer with long-standing ties to Republican candidates and causes, unsuccessfully argued in August for West to stay on the ballot. The attorney, Matt Haverstick, declined to say in an interview who hired him or why. People Over Party, the group Hamrick is affiliated with, had tried to get West on the ballot. None of these actions was funded by West’s campaign, though he and his “Justice for All” party have coordinated at times with Hamrick’s People Over Party, according to legal filings, a news release and social media posts. In North Carolina, People Over Party, worked with Blitz Canvassing and Campaign & Petition Management — two firms that routinely work for the GOP — to gather signatures for West. Hamrick later responded in writing on behalf of workers for the two companies after the state election board opened its inquiry. Jefferson Thomas, a longtime Republican operative from Colorado, submitted petition signatures that his firm, The Synapse Group, gathered on behalf of Stein in New Hampshire, records show. He did not respond to requests for comment. In Wisconsin, Blair Group Consulting oversaw West’s petition signature drive to qualify for the ballot, as previously reported by USA Today. David Blair, the firm’s president, was a the national director of Youth for Trump during the 2016 campaign and was a spokesman in the Trump administration. Blair declined to comment. Mark Jacoby, whose signature gathering firm Let the Voters Decide often works for Republicans, was involved in the failed Arizona push to get West on the ballot.

On July 10, Clooney became one of the most high-profile celebrities and Democrats to call on Biden to end his campaign when his op-ed published in the New York Times. “We are not going to win in November with this president,” the actor wrote at the time. “On top of that, we won’t win the House, and we’re going to lose the Senate. This isn’t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and Congress member and governor that I’ve spoken with in private.” Clooney — who just three weeks earlier had hosted a Biden fundraiser, an event that left many attendees with the impression that Biden was in decline, as Rolling Stone reported — added in his op-ed, “This is about age. Nothing more.” Eleven days later, on July 21, Biden dropped out of the presidential race and backed Vice President Kamala Harris, who Clooney subsequently also endorsed. While some credited Clooney’s very public request for Biden to step away as a turning point, the actor, in Venice for the premiere of his upcoming film Wolfs with Brad Pitt, instead credited the current president with the decision. “The person who should be applauded is the president, who has done the most selfless thing a president has done since George Washington,” Clooney said of Biden (via Variety). “What should be remembered is the selfless act of someone who, it’s very hard to let go of power — we know that, we’ve seen it all over the world — and for someone to say I think there’s a better path forward, all the credit goes to him. And that’s really the truth… I’m just very proud of where we are in the state of the world right now.” Following the publication of Clooney’s op-ed, it was later revealed that actor notified Barack Obama that he was penning the New York Times piece, and that the former president didn’t attempt to stop Clooney in the aftermath of Biden’s disastrous debate with Trump.","summary":"\"For someone to say I think there’s a better path forward, all the credit goes to him,\" says actor who penned op-ed calling for Biden to step down as Democratic candidate","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/george-clooney-praises-selfless-biden-op-ed-response-1235093397/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2169732980.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 19:25:25","author":"Daniel Kreps","authors":["Daniel Kreps"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.035}]}
