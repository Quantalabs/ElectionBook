The Supreme Court will rule on whether these districts violate equal protection under the Constitution.\n\nACLU Voting Rights Project Director Sophia Lin Lakin, who supports these majority-minority districts, said: “Sec. 2 of the Voting Rights Act has been a critical tool in safeguarding the promise that people of colour can participate in our democracy on equal terms. It has been our shield against discriminatory maps and our answer to laws designed to suppress the vote. Congress passed the Voting Rights Act with overwhelming, bipartisan support — and reauthorized it again and again — because our leaders understood a fundamental truth: you cannot cure discrimination by pretending it doesn’t exist.”\n\nNAACP lawyer Janai Nelson told the court, “It was clear that, regardless of party, white Democrats were not voting for Black candidates whether they were Democrats or not. We know that there is such a significant chasm between how Black and white voters vote in Louisiana that there is no question that even if there is some correlation between race and party, that race is the driving factor.”\n\nThe Supreme Court decades ago in Shaw v. Reno (1993) and Miller v. Johnson (1995) ruled against districts where gerrymandering by race was the dominant factor. “Ethnic cleansing!” cried Jesse Jackson after the Miller decision. Elaine Jones of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund said, “The noose is tightening.” Her colleague, Theodore Shaw, warned that once this decision goes through, the Black Congressional Caucus “could meet in the back seat of a taxicab.” But of the Black House members in the four redesigned majority-white Southern districts who decided to run for reelection, three won. One chose not to run.\n\nIn 2016, the city of over 100,000 population that most voted for Donald Trump, with 80% of the vote, was Abilene, Texas, a city that is over 75% white. Shortly after Trump’s election, Abilene voted for its first Black mayor. Black Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) recently said: “Myself, Wesley Hunt, Burgess Owens, John James — we are all Black men who represent majority-white districts (referring to Texas, Utah, and Michigan, respectively.) Tim Scott is the United States senator from South Carolina. South Carolina does have a strong Black population, but it’s a predominantly white state. These are the facts.” America’s three largest cities, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, all have Black mayors though none of these cities is majority Black. There are many examples of Blacks elected to statewide offices in a country where no state has a majority Black population. These include Sens. Barack Obama, Kamala Harris, Carol Moseley Braun and Cory Booker, as well as Govs. Doug Wilder, Deval Patrick and Wes Moore.\n\nAbout the 2008 presidential election, Obama’s principal rival for the Democratic nomination was Hillary Clinton. Obama was attempting to become the first Black president, while Clinton was attempting to become the first female president. On the Republican side, the two primary rivals were Mitt Romney, who would become the first Mormon president, and John McCain, who would become at 72 the oldest elected president. In February 2007, Gallup found that 5% of Americans said they “would not vote for” a Black presidential candidate; 11% “would not vote for” a woman; 24% “would not vote for” a Mormon; and 42% “would not vote for” a presidential candidate who is “72 years of age.” So, Obama’s hurdle was the lowest.\n\nAs for the Supreme Court, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) calls Republican-appointed jurists “often underqualified or completely unqualified for their role.”\n\nNothing says qualified quite like a bartender-turned-congressional candidate. And AOC got elected, proving yet again that despite America’s “systemic racism,” there’s hope.\n\n— Larry Elder is a bestselling U.S. author and nationally syndicated radio talk-show host.\n\n Share this Story : ELDER: White Democrats 'will not vote for Black candidates,' says NAACP Copy Link Email X Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr","summary":"The Supreme Court is considering a Louisiana redistricting case that could have a greater impact on U.S House of Representatives seats than the Texas and California &#8220;gerrymandering&#8221; manoeuvres combined.

And I’m not — I can’t do that.”\n\nNewsom has taken to needling Trump frequently on social media, mocking his all-caps, exclamation-mark heavy style, as well as taking more serious actions like suing him to stop his deployment of the National Guard to California cities or sending them to other states.\n\n“I’m looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that’s the question for the American people,” he said in the interview that aired Sunday.\n\nDemocrats have been trying to find a path out of the political wilderness after President Joe Biden waited until July 2024 to abandon his reelection campaign and anoint Harris as his successor. With little more than three months to build a campaign against Trump, she still won 226 Electoral College votes to Trump’s 312.

Why haven’t Democrats held a real primary in so long? Do they not trust their own voters, or something?\n\nHaving a truly competitive primary can do wonders for a political party. \n\nObama surprised Democrats in 2008, especially since so many of them thought it was Hillary Clinton’s turn to run for the White House. It may be hard for us to remember now, but Obama was the upstart with the funny name, challenging the Chappaqua heir apparent. His movement felt fresh and new. He won over the party, and Clinton stepped aside—with the clear expectation that she would be next in line.\n\nHe drove that party off a cliff with Obamacare, pushed the noxious narrative that police are systemically racist against black people, and moved full-steam ahead from “I support traditional marriage” to “marriage equality” to rewriting the Civil Rights Act to let boys into girls’ bathrooms.\n\nObama had a real knack for saying something insane in the most compelling way possible. He wrapped himself in the flag while laying the groundwork for demonizing our country and its history. He spoke about the better angels of our republic while unleashing the demons of Antifa.\n\nThe Great Awokening may have reached its fever pitch after the death of George Floyd during the Trump years, but Obama planted the seeds for it—and Trump got elected to pull out the weeds by their roots.\n\nNot Feeling the Bern?\n\nIn 2016, the American people were sick of Obama. He had promised a new era of hope and racial reconciliation—but America got more division, Black Lives Matter protests escalated into riots, and a host of scandals erupted, from the IRS targeting conservatives to long lines for care at Veterans Affairs hospitals to the gunrunning scandal at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nMany Democrats were angry, too, and a self-declared socialist who hadn’t even formally joined the party started taking off in the Democratic presidential primary. Hillary Clinton wasn’t happy at having her turn passed over once again, and the Democratic Party elites gave her many advantages over the socialist upstart, Bernie Sanders. From financial arrangements to internal messaging to the support of “superdelegates,” the party rallied around Clinton in a way that felt “rigged” to Sanders’ supporters. Democrats also effectively prevented other candidates from entering the race, making Sanders the only real competitor.\n\nThe Democrats pulled the strings for Clinton, and it backfired on them, as Americans voted for change that Trump had promised instead.\n\nBidenmentum?\n\nBernie Sanders won the first three Democrat presidential primaries in 2020 as well, after each of the other candidates failed to take off. Only when Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden did Obama’s former running mate pick up steam. One after another, candidates dropped out and endorsed Biden in a process that felt more orchestrated than organic.\n\nHad more candidates remained in the race, Sanders or perhaps Pete Buttigieg, the upstart mayor of South Bend, Indiana, might have prevailed. \n\nInstead, it seems the Democrats pulled the strings yet again, and they fell in lockstep behind Sleepy Joe—the guy even Kamala Harris viewed as easy pickings at the beginning of the primaries.\n\nBiden only barely defeated Trump, after Big Tech buried the Hunter Biden laptop story and after local election officials weakened voting safeguards in the name of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAnother Aborted Primary\n\nBiden said he would be a caretaker president, but then he decided to run for a second term. While many of us expressed concerns about his health long before his disastrous June 2024 debate against Trump, even the left-leaning media decided they couldn’t hide his infirmity any longer.\n\nRather than host a quick primary, Biden—and, ostensibly, Democrat leaders working with him—coronated Vice President Kamala Harris, who has recently made hay about the fact she only had 107 days to campaign for the presidency. \n\nDemocrats could have held a rapid-fire primary, as happens in special elections, but they chose Harris instead. Let’s just say the “vibes” election her supporters envisioned never actually materialized.\n\nWhat About 2028?\n\nAfter 2024, the Democratic Party has come to represent the old Silicon Valley woke elite consensus that Americans had firmly rejected coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sure, some “Karens” are still biking with masks on during the summer and the Left’s dark money network is bankrolling ironic “No Kings” protests, but the wind of the woke movement has petered out.\n\nSome Democrats know their party needs to tack to the center and return to reality, but the nonprofit activist apparatus that called the shots in the Biden administration is putting off its come-to-Jesus moment, likely perpetually. \n\nWhile truly competitive primaries can be messy—Trump proved a wrecking ball to the old Republican establishment—they often breathe new energy into a party, energy the tired old Democrats sorely need. Unfortunately, that energy seems most likely to come from outright socialists like Zohran Mamdani, who will only champion more of the destructive policies Obama pioneered.\n\nThe entrenched elites in the Democratic Party may not look the same as they did in 2016, but I suspect the 2028 Democrat presidential nomination will look more like a coronation than a truly democratic contest.","summary":"Democrats haven&#8217;t had a real primary since 2008, and I&#8217;m not bullish on the chances for a real contest in 2028, either.

Gavin Newsom said Sunday he’s considering a run for president in 2028 — just a day after former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris made the same pronouncement. Newsom, a Democrat who has become a nationally-renowned figure this year pitching himself a leader of the resistance to President Trump, admitted for the first time publicly that he is carefully weighing a 2028 presidential run. In an interview with \"CBS News Sunday Morning,\" Newsom was asked whether he would give \"serious thought\" after the 2026 midterms to a White House bid. \"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom replied. \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not — I can't do that.\" Harris said this weekend in an interview with the BBC that she expects a woman will be president in the coming year. “Possibly,” she said, it could be her. “I am not done,” she said. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it's in my bones.\" With more than three years until the November 2028 election, is entirely possible that only one or neither of the two California politicians could ultimately throw their hat in the race. But the early willingness of Newsom and Harris to publicly consider a White House bid shows that the Golden State remains a central power base Democratic politics. It also sets up a potential 2028 political showdown between two of California’s most prominent and nationally polarizing political figureheads. For years, Newsom has denied presidential ambitions, even as pundits have considered him a potential candidate. But since Trump defeated Harris in the November 2024 election, the California governor has emerged as a more vocal combative critic of the Trump administration's agenda. Under Newsom’s leadership, California has filed dozens of lawsuits against Trump — most noticeably against the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles. The governor has also become more aggressive on social media, taking to X to taunt and troll Trump. Still, Newsom, whose term ends in January 2027 and who cannot run again for governor because of term limits, cautioned that he is not rushing into a 2028 presidential campaign. \"I have no idea,\" Newsom said Sunday of whether he will actually decide to run. After Trump defeated Harris in November, Harris was viewed as a possible candidate for California governor. But in July she announced that, after “serious thought” she would not run for the top California office. “For now, my leadership — and public service — will not be in elected office,” Harris said in a statement. “I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans.” Newsom's interest in the White House raises the stakes for passing Proposition 50, a California ballot measure he has pushed — in response to a similar initiative in Texas — that would allow state Democrats to temporarily change the boundaries of U.S. House maps so that they are more favorable to Democrats. California voters will vote on Prop 50 in a special election next week. Newsom has promoted his effort as a response to Trump's push to redraw maps in Republican-controlled states to make them benefit the GOP. Some blue states have rules that prevent political gerrymandering, but Virginia is now following California's lead and a few others, such as Illinois and Maryland, are weighing similar actions. \"I think it's about our democracy,\" Newsom said in the CBS interview. \"It's about the future of this republic. I think it's about, you know, what the founding fathers lived and died for, this notion of the rule of law, and not the rule of Don.\" If Newsom is successful and Proposition 50 passes, the move could potentially help future Democratic candidates' bid for the White House. But either way, both Newsom and Harris would face high hurdles in battleground states if they ran for president. Just being a Californian is a liability, some argue, at a time when Republicans depict the state as a bastion of woke ideas, high taxes and crime. While California boasts the world’s fifth-largest economy and is home to the massive tech powerhouse of Silicon Valley and the cultural epicenter of Hollywood, it has struggled in recent years with high housing costs and massive income inequality. In September, a study found California tied with Louisiana for the nation’s highest poverty rate. Although Harris and Newsom both hail from the Bay Area and worked their way up the Democratic political system in San Francisco, they have yet to publicly compete for the same office. “We’ve been sort of on this track, but it was always adjacent,” Newsom told The Times last summer as Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee. “The tension was a sort of manifestation of punditry.” Newsom, 58, a former San Francisco mayor who was born to a well-connected San Francisco family, suggested in the CBS interview that he had surmounted significant obstacles to get to this point. Early on, Newsom struggled in school and suffered from dyslexia. \"The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom, the idea that you would even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary,” Newsom said. “Who the hell knows? I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people.\" Harris, 61, who was born to immigrant parents and raised in Compton, was a San Francisco Attorney General before she served as California Attorney General, U.S Senator and became she became vice president in 2020 and then the Democratic Party's nominee in the 2024 presidential election. She received criticism last year after losing to Trump by more than 2.3 million votes, about 1.5% of the popular vote. Some Democrats accused her of being an elite, out of touch candidate who failed to connect with voters in battleground states who have struggled economically in recent years. But speaking in Los Angeles last month as she promoted her new memoir, “107 Days,” Harris did not appeared to reflect on any errors she made in 2024. “I wrote the book for many reasons, but primarily to remind us how unprecedented that election was,” Harris said. “Think about it. A sitting president of the United States is running for reelection and three and a half months before the election decides not to run, and then a sitting vice president takes up the mantle to run against a former president of the United States who has been running for 10 years, with 107 days to go.” Harris' book received some criticism for keeping score and dishing dirt on Democrats who did not immediately support her bid for Democratic nominee. When she called Newsom, she wrote, he texted her that he was hiking and would call her back. According to Harris, he never did. Already this year, Newsom has raised eyebrows by traveling to critical battleground election states. In July, Newsom traveled more than 2,000 miles to South Carolina, a state that traditionally hosts the South’s first presidential primary. He said he was working to help the party win back the U.S. House of Representatives in 2026. But at the time there were a dozen competitive House districts in California. South Carolina, a staunchly conservative state, did not have a single competitive race. After Newsom spoke at an event in Camden, S.C. Rep. James Clyburn, the highest-ranking Black member of Congress and renowned Democratic kingmaker who played a key role in salvagingformer President Biden’s 2020 campaign, told The Times that Newsom would be “a hell of a candidate.” “He’s demonstrated that over and over again,” Clyburn said, although he stopped short of endorsing him. “I feel good about his chances.” But other leading South Carolina Democrats voiced doubts that Newsom could win over working class and swing voters in battleground states. Richard Harpootlian, a South Carolina attorneyand former chairman of the state Democratic Party, dubbed Newsom “a handsome man with great hair.” But he said the party was searching for someone quite different: \"a left-of-moderate candidate who can articulate blue-collar hopes and desires.\" “If he had a track record of solving huge problems like homelessness, or the social safety net, he’d be a more palatable candidate,” Harpootlian said. “I just think he’s going to have a tough time explaining why there’s so many failures in California.”","summary":"Gov.

However, Newsom added that he does not intend to make a decision about a 2028 run until after the 2026 midterm elections. Asked whether 2028 could be his moment to enter the race for the White House, the 58-year-old governor replied, “Fate will determine that.” Could it be Newsom Vs Trump in 2028? Newsom also stated that Democrats winning back the House in 2026 is crucial to restoring a “rebalanced system\" but said he fears that if Mike Johnson remains Speaker of the House, Republicans may try to push for “a third term of President Trump.” “His (Donald Trump) presidency, de facto, ends next November, if we’re successful …his presidency is over, de facto as we know it today, fire and fury signifying maybe something. But finally, you have rebalanced this system,” Newsom told the Bari Weiss-run CBS News. “If you have a speaker Johnson, we may have a third term of President Trump.” The California Governor has been at loggerheads with Trump over several issues. Earlier this year, he declared an all-out offensive against the US President, accusing him of \"pulling a military dragnet\" across Los Angeles and vowing to \"sue\" him as violent riots and vandalism rock the city. This, after Trump ordered the deployment of nearly 5,000 troops, including National Guard and Marines, to the nation's second-largest city.

Platner previously told Newsweek that he had no idea of the tattoo’s associations and said, “I absolutely would not have gone through life having this on my chest if I knew that—and to insinuate that I did is disgusting.”\n\nHe added: “I am already planning to get this removed.”\n\nNewsweek has contacted Platner and Mills via email for comment outside of regular working hours on Sunday.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nPlatner, 41, is running in the Democratic primary to face incumbent Republican Senator Susan Collins in the 2026 midterm elections. Also running to unseat Collins is the state’s incumbent governor, Janet Mills, who is term limited. Collins, meanwhile, is widely seen as being one of the most vulnerable Republican senators.\n\nDemocrats are hoping to seize control of the Senate in 2026 after losing it to Republicans in last year’s election.

Platner has previously said he had never tried to hide his tattoo and had passed security clearance to join the Army National Guard after leaving the Marines and later for the State Department when he worked as security detail for the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan.\n\nThe recent poll comes from a SoCal Strategies Survey of the Democratic Primary for Senate in Maine. It found that initially, Mills held a 5-point lead over Platner (41 percent to 36 percent), with a fifth of respondents saying they were undecided.\n\nWhen voters were informed of the scandal surrounding Platner’s tattoo, Mills’ lead increased 30 points (59 percent to 29 percent).\n\nDespite this general shift, Platner’s lead with young people has stayed strong. Among voters aged between 18 and 29, Platner had a lead (56 percent to 17 percent) against Mills. Support among these voters continued when they were informed of Platner’s tattoo scandal, with the demographic favoring him (52 percent to 31 percent.)\n\nThe poll surveyed 500 likely Democratic primary voters from October 21-25 and used the online Pollfish panel. Respondents were only registered voters living in Maine.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nGraham Platner wrote in a Wednesday X post that has been viewed 7 million times: “Years ago I got a skull and crossbones tattoo with my buddies in the Marine Corps. I was appalled to learn it closely resembled a Nazi symbol. I altered it yesterday, into something that isn’t deeply offensive to my core beliefs. I am very sorry to all of you who had to contemplate a symbol of hate over the past 48 hours.”\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, said last week during an appearance on The Axios Show: “He went through a dark period in his life. I suspect that Graham Platner is not the only American to have gone through a dark period…I think what we have got to do as a nation is not focus on a tattoo. We’ve got to focus on a system which in many ways is collapsing.”\n\nGovernor Janet Mills wrote in a post on X on October 19: “I’m the only person who can beat Susan Collins. Let’s do this.”\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on Tuesday during a press conference: “We think that Janet Mills is the best candidate to retire Susan Collins. She’s a tested two-term governor and the people of Maine have an enormous amount of affection and respect for her.”\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nMaine’s primary election is set for June 2...","summary":"Platner, who has now had the tattoo covered, maintains he had no idea of the tattoo&#039;s associations.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/graham-platner-nazi-tattoo-poll-janet-mills-young-voter-support-democrat-10941238","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2242325826_f4a689.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-26 17:39:32","author":"Marni Rose McFall","authors":["Marni Rose McFall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.365},{"id":372832210,"title":"Gavin Newsom Says He Will Consider Run For White House","text":"Newsom has also drawn attention for his trolling of Trump on social media.

Harris insisted in an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that aired Sunday that she had concerns about Biden running for president, but not about his ability to serve as president. She said she has reflected on whether she should have tried to talk to him about it, but was concerned that it would appear self-serving. \"But the context here, I think, at this historical moment you talk about, is so important because there had been months of speculation around the world, here in the U.K. too. Even in April, long before President Biden pulled out, we asked Nancy Pelosi what was going wrong. This was a huge subject of discussion, and you write that President Biden didn’t raise his frailty with you, and you write that you didn’t really raise it with him, that’s extraordinary to read in your account,\" Kuenssberg told Harris. Harris pushed back and said, \"Let's be more precise: there is a very serious difference between capacity to be president of the United States and the capacity to run for president of the United States.\" HARRIS LITERALLY THREW 'JOE BIDEN WON' TALKING POINTS ON TABLE AFTER DISASTROUS DEBATE: 'ARE YOU KIDDING ME?' \"It is on that latter piece that I talk about in the book, about my concern about his ability, with the level of endurance, energy that it requires, especially running against now the current president,\" she added. \"But let's be clear, my question was never about his capacity to be president.\" Kuenssberg questioned whether it was a strange message to send to the public. \"Isn't it a strange message to the public to say, you know what you need to be tougher and more able to run a political campaign than actually to be the person behind the desk in the Oval Office, to be the person making decisions in the Situation Room. So did you just not think it was that bad or did you feel you just couldn’t raise it?\" the BBC journalist asked. The former vice president reiterated that she was concerned about what the campaign would demand of any candidate, \"regardless of age.\" KAMALA HARRIS' DECISION NOT TO RUN IN 2026 OPENS DOOR TO POSSIBLE SECOND PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN 2028 Harris also suggested she might run for office again during the BBC interview, telling Kuenssberg, \"I am not done.\" \"I am not done,\" she told the United Kingdom outlet. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it’s in my bones.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Harris also labeled President Donald Trump a \"tyrant,\" accusing business leaders and institutions of cozying up to the president and bowing to his demands.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris was questioned on why she didn&apos;t raise her concerns about former President Biden&apos;s ability to run a campaign during a BBC interview on Sunday.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/kamala-harris-grilled-bbc-journalist-why-she-didnt-raise-concerns-about-bidens-capacity","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/kamala-harris-biden-bbc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-26 14:58:31","author":"Hanna Panreck","authors":["Hanna Panreck"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":372788440,"title":"Kamala Harris repeatedly pressed on notion Biden had capacity to serve as president, but not run for re-election","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\n3 Play Sameday October 26, 2025 01:40 \n\n Kamala Harris repeatedly pressed on notion Biden had capacity to serve as president, but not run for re-election \n Former Vice President Kamala Harris was repeatedly pressed on why she didn't raise concerns about former President Biden's re-election effort, as the former VP insisted she never questioned Biden's ability to serve as president.\n Tags V-VIDEOMEDIA","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris was repeatedly pressed on why she didn&apos;t raise concerns about former President Biden&apos;s re-election effort, as the former VP insisted she never questioned Biden&apos;s ability to serve as president.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6384094658112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/10c3a7b5-f719-4bf1-9d05-80c8d9f4b47e/6736fc98-a5d0-4d7f-b42e-46b792e4616b/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-26 14:38:10","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.436},{"id":372749938,"title":"Kamala Harris hints at possible 2028 presidential bid","text":"Kamala Harris isn’t ruling out another run for the White House.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC posted Saturday, Harris said she expects a woman will be president in the coming years, and it could “possibly” be her.\n\n“I am not done,” the former California attorney general and senator said.\n\nThe former vice president said she hasn’t decided whether to mount a 2028 presidential campaign.

However, she firmly insisted that her career in American politics is far from over.\n\n“I have lived my entire career a life of service, and it’s in my bones, and there are many ways to serve,” Harris told the British broadcaster. In a moment of personal reflection, she expressed unwavering confidence that her young grandnieces would see a female president in the Oval Office “in their lifetime, for sure.”\n\nThe full interview is set to air on Sunday.\n\nA Prelude to a 2028 Campaign?\n\nPolitical analysts view these statements as a clear signal that Harris is positioning herself as a potential frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in the 2028 election. As the most prominent figure in the party to have served as Vice President, she maintains significant name recognition and a base of support, despite the ticket’s loss in 2024.\n\n“This is the beginning of the ‘never count me out’ tour,” said David Axelrod, a former senior advisor to President Barack Obama. “She’s reminding the Democratic base and donors that she remains a central figure in the party’s future, especially after a period of public reflection and critique.”\n\nMemoir Fuels Tensions with Biden Camp\n\nThe television interview follows the recent release of Harris’s memoir, The Truths We Hold, which has stirred controversy within Democratic circles. In the book, she argues that it was an act of “recklessness” to allow the then-81-year-old Biden to run for a second term, a move she implies contributed to their defeat.\n\nMore damagingly, she accuses Biden’s senior White House team of consistently failing to support her during her tenure as vice president and, at times, of “actively hindering” her efforts. She describes facing unique challenges and being sidelined on key issues, which she claims hampered her ability to govern effectively.\n\nThe White House has not issued an official response to the memoir’s allegations, but anonymous aides have pushed back, calling the characterization a “misrepresentation” of a collaborative relationship.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nHarris’s comments and literary broadside set the stage for a complex political future. She must now navigate the delicate task of defining her own political identity separate from the Biden administration while maintaining party unity in opposition to a second Trump term.\n\nHer potential path to the 2028 nomination is likely to be contested by a new generation of Democratic leaders. However, by publicly stating she is “not done,” Kamala Harris has made it clear that she intends to be a central part of the conversation shaping the party’s direction for years to come.\n\nSupport Dawat Media Center\n\nIf there were ever a time to join us, it is now.

'I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it's in my bones,' she said.\n\nHer remarks, layered with both reflection and reproach, painted the portrait of a politician undaunted by defeat and unafraid to take on her former opponent.\n\nDirect Shot at Trump\n\nHarris's comments reignited a rivalry that defined the closing chapter of America's last election. She accused Trump of weaponising federal agencies, targeting critics, and undermining the democratic institutions she once defended within the Oval Office.\n\nHarris argued that Trump had evolved from a populist firebrand into an authoritarian leader.\n\nThe former vice president cited the suspension of comedian Jimmy Kimmel after he mocked a right-wing influencer, saying: 'His skin is so thin he couldn't endure criticism from a joke, and he tried to shut down an entire media organisation in the process.'\n\nShe also reiterated her disapproval of companies, universities, media outlets, and law firms that she claimed had capitulated to Trump's demands.\n\nDoug Emhoff, Harris's husband and a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, works at a law firm that was among the first to broker an agreement with the Trump administration to avoid sanctions. He later clarified that he disagreed with the firm's pledge of $100 million (£82 million) in pro bono work supporting causes championed by Trump.\n\nDespite describing her 2024 campaign loss as 'traumatising,' Harris has remained steadfast.\n\nWhen asked whether she might run for president again, Harris replied, 'Possibly.' She said she has yet to decide but still believes she has a role to play in public life.\n\nAlthough polls currently place her behind celebrities such as Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson in the race for the Democratic ticket, Harris dismissed the numbers, insisting she has never let polling dictate her path.\n\n'If I listened to polls, I would not have run for my first office, or my second office, and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here,' she told the BBC.\n\n2024 Attacks Resurface\n\nTrump had repeatedly attacked Harris's competence and character on the 2024 campaign trail.\n\nAt a rally in North Carolina last year, AP News reported Trump labelling Harris 'lazy as hell' and questioned her intelligence and stamina. According to ABC News, he has also challenged Harris's racial identity, suggesting publicly that she had 'turned Black' and previously been 'Indian all the way,' a remark widely criticised as divisive and inaccurate.\n\nBehind closed doors, Trump allegedly used a derogatory slur directed at Harris during private conversations. Although his campaign disputes this allegation.\n\nTrump's criticism of Harris has focused more on personal attacks than policy disagreements, such as highlighting her background, suitability for office, and campaign style. These had only heightened the long-standing hostility between the two individuals.\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK","summary":"Kamala Harris said she may run for president again, while attacking Donald Trump and claiming her past warnings about him were proven right.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/kamala-harris-hints-2028-presidential-run-after-fierce-attack-trump-hes-tyrant-3788438","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4631147/kamala-harris.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-26 11:25:18","author":"Aoc On Air","authors":["Aoc On Air"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.149},{"id":372724274,"title":"Bay Area partisans are fired up over California’s Prop 50 contest. Others? Not so much","text":"Republican Max Hsia and about a dozen of his South Bay Patriots group gathered in the San Jose parking lot of Bass Pro Shops, donned their red MAGA hats, hung their “No on Prop 50” signs on a pop-up tent and tried to encourage a Charlie Kirk-style “Prove Me Wrong” debate with passers-by.\n\nThat’s not what they got with Evangelina Zavala. Instead, she pulled her Subaru SUV into a nearby parking slot, rolled down her windows and blasted the hip hop protest song, “(Expletive) Donald Trump.”\n\nHsia approached her. “We do have a microphone if you’d like to speak your piece and share your thoughts,” he said.\n\n“You guys can share your thoughts,” she said, “I share my music.”\n\nWith only one statewide measure on the Nov. 4 special election ballot, partisans are squaring off across the Bay Area. Despite more than $100 million spent on the ballot fight so far, however, many are tuning out.\n\nProposition 50 would temporarily redraw the boundaries of California’s 52 congressional districts to help Democrats flip five of the nine seats now held by Republicans, a Democratic countermove to a Republican-led effort in Texas. But none of those five targeted districts are in the heavily Democratic Bay Area, where its impact is less personal.\n\nPartisans like Hsia and Zavala are fired up. So is Democratic volunteer Debbie Raucher of Oakland, who’s been spending weekends knocking on doors to encourage Yes on 50 votes, and Republicans in San Jose like Carol Pefley who hang “No on 50” banners over freeway overpasses during rush hour. But across the Bay Area, others are barely tuning in.\n\nIn a region where locals are most concerned about sky-high housing prices and budget-busting groceries, keeping up with an interstate political battle can seem irrelevant. In the Bass Pro Shops parking lot, the only shopper who took the mic was a man who wanted to debate the legacy of the slain conservative activist Kirk rather than Proposition 50.\n\nWhen Menlo College Professor Melissa Michelson asked her Politics 150 class in San Mateo County last week about what’s on the Nov. 4 ballot, most of her students “tried to look invisible.”\n\n“They don’t see how this affects their life. It just seems like stupid politics,” Michelson said. “And I think that is a huge problem for the Prop. 50 proponents.”\n\nTo Zavala, however, a sixth-generation Californian, it’s all about her opposition to President Trump. The 38-year-old mother has a planned trip to San Diego with her school-age son, but she’s nervous that she might be profiled and apprehended by federal ICE agents near the Mexican border.\n\n“I’m taking my mother, who’s a little bit lighter-skinned than me, because I’m afraid,” she said. “I have a passport, I’m college educated, I’m taking birth certificates when we go down there because who knows, right?”\n\nPro-Prop 50 videos coursing through social media are tapping into that fear. Former President Barack Obama, for instance, narrates a commercial over images of ICE agent crackdowns, saying, “Democracy is on the ballot.” Meanwhile, former Republican California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who had championed the state’s voter-approved independent redistricting commission, calls the measure “insane” and “a big mistake.”\n\nIn a state that voted overwhelmingly for former Vice President Kamala Harris over Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election — a nearly 60-40 split — Democrats have a huge advantage. A recent poll conducted by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report found that 50% of registered voters supported Proposition 50 compared with 35% opposed. Still, nearly half of those were either soft on their position or undecided.\n\nThe ballot measure is part of an ongoing national congressional redistricting battle heating up ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. How those districts are drawn can shape the outcome, stoking accusations of gerrymandering — drawing district boundaries to advantage one party over another.\n\nSince 2011, California’s Citizens Redistricting Commission has redrawn congressional lines after the 10-year Census indicates population shifts. Six other states have similar systems, while in most others, including Texas, lawmakers redraw the boundaries.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in 2019 ruled that partisan gerrymandering is beyond the federal courts’ jurisdiction. But it is now reviewing a section of The Voting Rights Act that bans gerrymandering intended to dilute the voting power of racial minorities. If justices overturn it — perhaps as early as January — voting rights groups say it could heavily favor Republican congressional districts, especially in the South.\n\nPresident Trump called for Texas lawmakers to change the Congressional lines before the 2026 midterm elections to help Republicans maintain their majority. Republicans say they’re countering aggressive blue-state gerrymandering that already gives Democrats outsized congressional representation relative to their statewide vote share, even in independently drawn California.\n\n“California has 40% conservative voters and only 17% representation in Congress,” said Pefley, who is running for state Assembly and attended a debate on the proposition in San Jose. “If Prop. 50 passes, we’ll have 7% representation for 40% of the population, and that is not a constitutional republic. A constitutional republic is supposed to be representative of the people. And right now, California is not.”\n\nProposition 50 essentially began as a bluff. Democratic U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren from the South Bay said the threat was intended to deter Texas from going through with its mid-decade change, since California would neutralize its Republican gains.\n\nWhen it didn’t, California — led by Trump antagonist and potential presidential candidate Gov. Gavin Newsom — steamed ahead as well. If the proposition passes, the new congressional districts will be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections. California’s independent redistricting commission would resume its work after the 2030 Census.\n\nFor some Bay Area voters, the political gamesmanship has overshadowed what they really care about — the high cost of living here, from housing to gas to groceries.\n\nA poll by the San Francisco-based Latino Community Foundation in late September showed that 46% of Latino voters planned to vote yes on Proposition 50, and 29% were still undecided. In California, the Democratic Party has generally won over the Latino community. Two-thirds of them voted for Harris over Trump in November.\n\n“But something that we’ve seen in recent years is an increase in the number of independents not loyal to any political party,” said Christian Arana from the Latino Community Foundation. “If our data is showing that 29% are undecided, these are winnable votes. It’s going to require contact and investment and education because in the midst of all the many problems that we’re facing as Californians, this is not something that is top of mind for many people.”\n\nHsia, who sponsored the rally at the Bass Pro Shops and also organizes freeway overpass rallies with Pefley, said he’s happy when he gets a toot of a horn during rush hour — a sign he hopes means the motorist agrees that Proposition 50 is a bad idea.\n\nIn Oakland, Raucher says she often encounters people as she canvases door-to-door who are unaware of the measure, and some are initially uncomfortable with the idea of redrawing congressional lines specifically to favor one party.\n\nEach time, she explains that “these are not normal times,” she said. “What I always say to them is unprecedented times call for unprecedented actions.”","summary":"Turnout will be key, and likely in the hands of passionate partisans, including the mostly Republican crowd that drove through the first big rainstorm of the season in San Jose to weigh in on a debate, and Democrats who are canvassing across the East Bay.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/10/26/bay-area-partisans-are-fired-up-over-californias-prop-50-contest-others-not-so-much/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SJM-L-PROP50DEBATE-22.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-26 11:00:12","author":"Julia Prodis Sulek","authors":["Julia Prodis Sulek"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.059},{"id":372843434,"title":"Look out, Donald: Inflation and economic fears are coming for you","text":"This time last year, America was focused on the upcoming presidential election. Despite a major hiccup during the summer, in which President Joe Biden bowed out after weeks of fevered speculation following a catastrophic debate performance and left Vice President Kamala Harris to carry the banner into November, Democrats were feeling very positive about their prospects. After all, the former guy, as Biden often referred to him, had lost the previous election, tried to stage a coup and had been convicted of 34 felonies. He couldn’t possibly make a comeback.\n\nBut no matter how they tried to explain it to voters or to shift the focus to other issues, Democrats were faced with a problem. In the end, they couldn’t escape it. \n\nIn mid-2021, for the first time in 40 years, inflation took hold of the American economy. The Covid-19 pandemic had caused upheaval around the world. Delayed consumer demand accelerated dramatically at a time when supply chains were chaotic and necessary government stimulus increased the money supply. The Russian invasion of Ukraine put even more stress on the situation by driving up food prices and energy costs. By June 2022, inflation reached 9%.\n\nIn October 2024, just a month before the presidential election, inflation had decreased dramatically to 2.4%, just slightly above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. But people weren’t feeling the recovery — and in politics, perception is everything.\n\nPrices hadn’t reverted to what they were before the pandemic. And when the price of eggs spiked due to an outbreak of avian flu, it became the symbol of general anger and unhappiness at the overall economy. The vibes, as they became known, were bad. \n\nMany Democratic party officials, pundits and analysts believe inflation is what got Donald Trump reelected. There were enough people who were spooked by perceptions about the economy, and many remembered the first Trump administration as a kind of golden economic age — mostly because he kept telling them they were. They believed he would bring prices down. At campaign events and in interviews, Trump would be asked what he planned to do about the cost of living, and he would meander around, saying that tariffs would bring in huge amounts of money, implying the government would cover additional costs. \n\nWant more sharp takes on politics? Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only, written by Amanda Marcotte, now also a weekly show on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nDuring one appearance, he was asked about the soaring cost of child care. He clearly had no idea how to respond, so he first referenced his daughter Ivanka’s work on the issue during his first term. Then Trump declared that, “relatively speaking, [childcare is] not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we’ll be taking in.” At an event at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, he posed with tables full of groceries and vowed, “When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on Day One.”\n\nThat never happened, and now many of the people who were counting on their grocery bills going back to what they were seven or eight years ago are gravely disappointed. Still, that hasn’t stopped Trump from telling them that their vibes are wrong and that inflation is gone. During a Thursday roundtable at the White House, he dismissed such anxieties. “Inflation, I’ve already taken care of,” he said. “Economically, the country is the strongest it’s ever been — thank God for tariffs. If we didn’t have tariffs we’d be a third-world nation.”\n\nThat’s a typically absurd comment and barely anyone believes it — not even many of his own supporters. Polling shows that inflation is the president’s lowest issue rating, averaging in the mid-30s and dropping. While the price of eggs has fallen back to normal levels now that the bird flu crisis has abated, people are seeing the price of beef skyrocket by 51% since February 2020. Americans famously love beef, so this placed Trump in dangerous territory — even before he announced his plan to quadruple imports of Argentinian beef, which have left ranchers “furious,” according to the New York Times.\n\nThe president’s tariffs haven’t helped. Inflation has been edging up ever since he announced his trade war in April, despite the warnings of most economists, who cautioned that tariffs will raise prices for consumers. The full effects of Trump’s tariffs haven’t yet been felt. Bigger companies were able to front load their inventories in anticipation, and small businesses have been taking out loans and freezing hiring to keep from raising prices. While farmers are being squeezed by losing their international markets due to retaliatory tariffs, they are facing higher prices for their own inputs at the same time. \n\nAside from the AI boom that’s fueling the stock market bubble, the economy is basically frozen, according to economist Paul Krugman. Everyone is holding their breath, waiting to see if the mercurial Trump will continue these tariffs, or if he will pull back once he’s flattered just the right way or given something he wants in return. (On Saturday, Trump announced an additional 10% tariff on Canadian goods after a television ad funded by Ontario used the voice of President Ronald Reagan to denounce tariffs and aired during the World Series. He had already suspended trade talks with Canada on Thursday because of the ad.) But with the tariffs in effect, businesses are paying more for the imports they need to produce their goods and supply their customers. \n\nThe government shutdown has delayed the release of all economic data except the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for September, which the administration called back federal workers to produce because it’s required to determine Social Security payments. On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the CPI showed a 3% rise when compared to September 2024 — the fastest annual pace since the start of the year. When combined with what is assumed to still be a deteriorating job market — those numbers are still unavailable due to the shutdown — it shows that Trump’s claim that the economy is the strongest it’s ever been to be laughable. \n\nInflation is now a ticking time bomb for Republicans. They should have learned from the Biden administration’s stumbles that you can’t persuade people that they should be happy about the cost of living just because the statistics are good. And in this case, the statistics are not good. In fact, they’re getting worse.\n\nNot even Trump, with his talent for pounding falsehoods so relentlessly that it convinces a lot of people to believe him instead of their own eyes, can beat the vibes when people are paying more and earning less. It’s another perfect storm, and this time it’s one entirely of his own making.","summary":"Trump and the GOP haven't learned from Biden's misread of economic perceptions","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/10/26/look-out-donald-inflation-and-economic-fears-are-coming-for-you/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/08/Donald-Trump-2232255558-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-26 10:45:40","author":"Heather Digby Parton","authors":["Heather Digby Parton"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.248},{"id":372820666,"title":"Kamala Harris gives biggest hint yet she might run for President again","text":"Kamala Harris has said she may run again for the US presidency despite losing out in 2024 to 'tyrant' Donald Trump.\n\nThe former US vice president told the BBC she would 'possibly' be America's president one day and was confident there would be a woman in the White House in the near future.\n\nMs Harris, 61, stepped in last year at the last minute when then-President Joe Biden stood down from running for a second term.\n\nSpeaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Ms Harris dismissed polls that put her as an outsider to become the Democrats' pick in 2028.\n\nShe said: 'If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office - and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here.'\n\nMs Harris added: 'I am not done, I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it's in my bones.'\n\nShe also branded Trump a 'tyrant' and said her warnings about him on the campaign trail had been proved right.\n\nResponding to the comments about Trump, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said: 'When Kamala Harris lost the election in a landslide, she should've taken the hint - the American people don't care about her absurd lies.'\n\nMs Harris’ full interview with the BBC was broadcast on Sunday at 9am and comes as she releases her book 107 Days, which is a nod to the amount of time she had to run for president after Biden withdrew.","summary":"Kamala Harris has said she may run again for the US presidency despite losing out in 2024 to 'tyrant' Donald Trump.

Does age equal obsolescence?","text":"Barbara Boxer decided she was done. Entering her 70s, fresh off reelection to the U.S. Senate, she determined her fourth term would be her last. \"I just felt it was time,\" Boxer said. \"I wanted to do other things.\" Besides, she knew the Democratic bench was amply stocked with many bright prospects, including California's then-attorney general, Kamala Harris, who succeeded Boxer in Washington en route to her selection as Joe Biden's vice president. When Boxer retired in 2017, after serving 24 years in the Senate, she walked away from one of the most powerful and privileged positions in American politics, a job many have clung to until their last, rattling breath. (Boxer tried to gently nudge her fellow Democrat and former Senate colleague, Dianne Feinstein, whose mental and physical decline were widely chronicled during her final, difficult years in office. Ignoring calls to step aside, Feinstein died at age 90, hours after voting on a procedural matter on the Senate floor.) Now an effort is underway among Democrats, from Hawaii to Massachusetts, to force other senior lawmakers to yield, as Boxer did, to a new and younger generation of leaders. The movement is driven by the usual roiling ambition, along with revulsion at Donald Trump and the existential angst that visits a political party every time it loses a dispiriting election like the one Democrats faced in 2024. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has become the highest profile target. Last week, she drew a second significant challenger to her reelection, state Sen. Scott Wiener, who jumped into the contest alongside tech millionaire Saikat Chakrabarti, who's been campaigning against the incumbent for the better part of a year. Pelosi — who is 85 and hasn't faced a serious election fight in San Francisco since Ronald Reagan was in the White House — is expected to announce sometime after California's Nov. 4 special election whether she'll run again in 2026. Boxer, who turns 85 next month, offered no counsel to Pelosi, though she pushed back against the notion that age necessarily equates with infirmity, or political obsolescence. She pointed to Ted Kennedy and John McCain, two of the senators she served with, who remained vital and influential in Congress well into their 70s. On the other hand, Boxer said, \"Some people don't deserve to be there for five minutes, let alone five years ... They're 50. Does that make it good? No. There are people who are old and out of ideas at 60.\" There is, Boxer said, \"no one-size-fits-all\" measure of when a lawmaker has passed his or her expiration date. Better, she suggested, for voters to look at what's motivating someone to stay in office. Are they driven by purpose — and still capable of doing the job — \"or is it a personal ego thing or psychological thing?\" \"My last six years were my most prolific,\" said Boxer, who opposes both term limits and a mandatory retirement age for members of Congress. \"And if they'd said 65 and out, I wouldn't have been there.\" Art Agnos didn't choose to leave office. He was 53 — in the blush of youth, compared to some of today's Democratic elders — when he lost his reelection bid after a single term as San Francisco mayor. \"I was in the middle of my prime, which is why I ran for reelection,\" he said. \"And, frankly,\" he added with a laugh, \"I still feel like I'm in my prime at 87.\" A friend and longtime Pelosi ally, Agnos bristled at the ageism he sees aimed at lawmakers of a certain vintage. Why, he asked, is that acceptable in politics when it's deplored in just about every other field of endeavor? \"What profession do we say we want bright young people who have never done this before to take over because they're bright, young and say the right things?\" Agnos asked rhetorically. \"Would you go and say, 'Let me find a brain surgeon who's never done this before, but he's bright and young and has great promise.' We don't do that. Do we? \"Give me somebody who's got experience, \" Agnos said, \"who's been through this and knows how to handle a crisis, or a particular issue.\" Pete Wilson also left office sooner than he would have like, but that's because term limits pushed him out after eight years as California governor. (Before that, he served eight years in the Senate and 11 as San Diego mayor.) \"I thought that I had done a good job ... and a number of people said, 'Gee, it's a pity that you can't run for a third term,' \" Wilson said as he headed to New Haven, Conn., for his college reunion, Yale class of ’55. \"As a matter of fact, I agreed with them.\" Still, unlike Boxer, Wilson supports term limits, as a way to infuse fresh blood into the political system and prevent too many over-the-hill incumbents from heedlessly overstaying their time in office. Not that he's blind to the impetus to hang on. The power. The perks. And, perhaps above all, the desire to get things done. At age 92, Wilson maintains an active law practice in Century City and didn't hesitate — \"Yes!\" he exclaimed — when asked if he considered himself capable of serving today as governor, even as he wends his way through a tenth decade on Earth. His wife, Gayle, could be heard chuckling in the background. \"She's laughing,\" Wilson said dryly, \"because she knows she's not in any danger of my doing so.\"","summary":"Seasoned California politicians, including former Sen.

While she did not confirm any plans, Harris said her current focus remains on public service and the future of America.After Her 2024 Election DefeatHarris’s remarks come nearly a year after her defeat in the 2024 presidential election, when Donald Trump returned to the White House.Harris had stepped in as the Democratic nominee after Joe Biden decided not to seek re-election, but her campaign struggled to attract voters in key battleground states.The loss placed Harris under public scrutiny and doubt. However, she now appears to be rebuilding her political image and reconnecting with her base. In an earlier interview with People magazine, Harris said, “I If I listened to polls, I would have not run for my first office, or my second office — and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here.”Seeking Momentum for 2028Harris has recently been active in policy forums and public discussions, promoting issues central to her platform such as gender equality, gun reform, and women’s reproductive rights.According to AP News, Harris is working to restore grassroots support and expand her network among young and minority voters. Although she has not made an official announcement, her statement “I’m not done” is seen as her clearest political signal since her defeat.It shows her determination not to be remembered only as America’s first female vice president, but as a leader still aiming for a historic return to the White House, this time as president.Editor’s Choice: Timor Leste Officially Joins ASEAN as 11th MemberClick here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News","summary":"Former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has hinted that she may not be done with politics, signaling the possibility of another presidential run.","url":"https://en.tempo.co/read/2060474/im-not-done-kamala-harris-hints-at-possible-2028-u-s-presidential-run","image":"https://statik.tempo.co/data/2024/11/08/id_1351610/1351610_720.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-26 09:35:25","author":"Istiqomatul Hayati","authors":["Istiqomatul Hayati"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"id","sentiment":0.011},{"id":372690758,"title":"‘I am not done’, Kamala Harris says she may run for US president again","text":"Former US Vice President Kamala Harris has hinted she may run for president again, telling the BBC she would “possibly” return to the White House race in the future.\n\nIn her first UK interview since losing to Donald Trump in the 2024 election, Harris expressed confidence that America would one day elect a female president. \n\nShe made her strongest indication yet that she could mount another presidential campaign in 2028, brushing off polls that rank her as an outsider for the Democratic nomination.\n\nSpeaking to Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Harris criticised Trump, calling him a “tyrant”, and said her earlier warnings about his leadership had been proven right.\n\nAs Democrats continue to analyse their loss to Trump, many within the party have blamed former President Joe Biden for not stepping aside early enough, while others have questioned whether Harris could have run a stronger campaign focused on the economy.\n\nDuring the interview, Harris said her grandnieces would, “in their lifetime, for sure”, see a female president. Asked if that person could be her, she replied, “possibly”, signalling she is considering another run.\n\nAlthough she has not made a final decision, Harris made clear that she still sees a future for herself in politics. “I am not done,” she said. “I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it’s in my bones.”\n\nHarris dismissed polls that place her behind figures such as Hollywood actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson in the Democratic field, insisting she never bases decisions on public opinion. \n\n“If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office – and I certainly wouldn’t be sitting here,” she said.\n\nShe also accused Trump of fulfilling her earlier predictions that he would behave like a fascist and weaponise government institutions. \n\n“He said he would weaponise the Department of Justice – and he has done exactly that,” she said, citing the suspension of comedian Jimmy Kimmel by ABC after a joke about the right-wing reaction to influencer Charlie Kirk’s death.\n\nHarris claimed the suspension, celebrated by Trump, came after pressure from a Trump-appointed regulator. “You look at what has happened in terms of how he has weaponised, for example, federal agencies going around after political satirists… His skin is so thin he couldn’t endure criticism from a joke, and attempted to shut down an entire media organisation in the process,” she said.\n\nShe further criticised business leaders and institutions that have, in her view, yielded too easily to Trump’s influence. \n\n“There are many… that have capitulated since day one, who are bending the knee at the foot of a tyrant, I believe for many reasons, including they want to be next to power, because they want to perhaps have a merger approved or avoid an investigation,” Harris said.\n\nThe White House responded dismissively to her remarks. “When Kamala Harris lost the election in a landslide, she should’ve taken the hint – the American people don’t care about her absurd lies,” said spokeswoman Abigail Jackson. “Or maybe she did take the hint and that’s why she’s continuing to air her grievances to foreign publications.”\n\nHarris recently released 107 Days, a memoir detailing her presidential campaign and the brief period she had to run after Biden withdrew amid questions over his health\n\nALSO READ TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE","summary":"Harris criticised Trump, calling him a “tyrant”, and said her earlier warnings about his leadership had been proven right.","url":"https://tribuneonlineng.com/i-am-not-done-kamala-harris-says-she-may-run-for-us-president-again/","image":"https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/US-former-Vice-President-Kamala-Harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-26 09:07:16","author":"Adam Mosadioluwa","authors":["Adam Mosadioluwa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":372678208,"title":"The 9 at 9: Sunday","text":"We need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

Our politics reporter Jane Matthews reports on how the Connolly campaign gained momentum.\n\nThe campaign relied heavily on the skills and enthusiasm of volunteers.\n\n“At the beginning, you wondered how quickly and fast it would grow – nobody could have predicted the way the campaign went,” one person involved told The Journal.\n\nGetting on the ballot\n\n3.

Sincerely. I have not decided. I may or I may not. I have not decided.”\n\nAsked specifically whether she still wanted to do the job itself, she used the past tense, saying: “It’s a job I wanted to do.”\n\nBut she noted that the only way to do it “is to run” and win.\n\nMeanwhile, political jockeying among Democrats for the 2028 presidential contest appears to be playing out even earlier than usual.\n\nSeveral potential candidates are already taking steps to get to know voters in key states, including California governor Gavin Newsom, term-limited Kentucky governor Andy Beshear and California representative Ro Khanna.\n\nUpwards of 30 high-profile Democrats could ultimately enter the primary.\n\nPress Association\n\nView 10 comments\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Kamala Harris not ruling out another run at the White House”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Kamala Harris not ruling out another run at the White House”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nThis is YOUR comments community.

Who turned out the lights?\n\nA log cabin in the woods.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nFor most people, spending three days alone in a cabin in the woods in complete darkness would be the stuff of nightmares. But this sensory deprivation retreat is aimed at cutting out the noise to reflect and find clarity. Chris Colin gave it a try. \n\n(The New York Times Magazine, approx 18 mins reading time)\n\nGaza. Ukraine. Sudan. School shootings. Terrible images came roaring out of some corner of my mind. One by one they scrolled, boiling with death and terror and heartbreak. I couldn’t move, just sat there holding my bowl. It’s not that I don’t ponder these horrors in daily life — it’s that I contain them. I’ll read the latest awfulness and then veer into outrage, or political strategy, or more reading, and then leave for car-pool duty. Now all I could do was sit with that awfulness. A strange dam broke. Just minutes later, the tape along the bathroom door came loose, lighting up that side of the room. I shot up to cover the leak, only to discover I imagined it. I trekked to my cushion, and I was now inside a snow cave. The cave morphed into the Milky Way, so vivid that comets zipped by. Soon I was in an old stone fortress. (Habsburgian, I somehow knew.) Moonlight poured through a hole in the roof, bathing the floor in a pale blue and illuminating a column of dust. In normal life, I struggle to summon visuals in my head; here I was Rembrandt.\n\n2. Daniel Kinahan\n\nEd Caesar’s in depth investigation into the wanted criminal and the billion-dollar drugs empire he commands from Dubai is an excellent read. \n\n(The New Yorker, approx 45 mins reading time)\n\nKelly said that the Kinahans often worked with a powerful Hezbollah operative whom he called the Ghost. (The operative was connected to the Kinahans through a Dutch criminal named, unimprovably, Mink Kok.) According to Kelly, the relationship between the Ghost and the Kinahans became close enough that, in 2015, the Irish group did Hezbollah a favor: it arranged the assassination of a fifty-six-year-old Iranian electrician living under a false identity in Almere, a sleepy town in the Netherlands. The regime in Tehran believed that, in 1981, the electrician, Mohammad Reza Kolahi—then a student and a member of an Iranian dissident group—had planted a bomb at the Islamic Republican Party’s headquarters, killing seventy-three people. He fled the country, but was sentenced to death in absentia. The Kinahan link to the murder wasn’t immediately obvious. But, a few months after Kolahi was killed, Irish police executed a search warrant on a Dublin apartment linked with the Kinahan gang. There, they found a corpulent Dutch Moroccan gangster, Naoufal (the Belly) Fassih, who spoke broken English, carried two fake I.D.s, and wore a watch worth tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Gold rush\n\nBars of gold bullion.Shutterstock\n\nShutterstock\n\nThe price of the precious metal has soared due to a rise in people investing in it. But why is this happening, and how long will it last? \n\n(Financial Times, approx 13 mins reading time)\n\nThe big engine underlying the rally since 2022 has been record purchases by central banks, mainly in developing countries, who want to diversify their reserve assets away from the US dollar. On top of that, a more recent wave of institutional and retail buying has taken the market by surprise: a record $26bn poured into gold-backed exchange traded funds during the third quarter — as an investor community that has long been sceptical about the incomeless asset has been overtaken by what some dubbed “gold-plated Fomo”. On the back of the surging flows, Société Générale has said that reaching $5,000 per troy ounce is “increasingly inevitable”. Every storyline of 2025 is invoked as a reason to buy. A haven from Donald Trump’s America and a less stable world; protection from future debt crises in rich countries; and the sole remaining refuge from richly priced stocks when bonds are wobbling.\n\n4. Put out to pasture\n\nActors have been campaigning against studios using AI to replicate their performances for a while now. It turns out the same thing is happening to animal actors, leaving trainers worried about the future of their profession. \n\n(The Hollywood Reporter, approx 6 mins reading time)\n\n“It has certainly impacted the studio animal trainers and the studio animal business already quite a lot,” says Karin McElhatton, owner of Studio Animal Services, which houses Rocco and scores of other critters, from dozens of cats to a “retired squirrel” to a duck named Bob, supplying animal talent for productions like Ghostbusters, L.A. Confidential and CSI: Miami. AI isn’t the only challenge: The fallout from COVID, the 2023 strikes and the overall contraction of the entertainment business also have hit hard. But some in the field fear virtual animals could be the final blow.\n\nA few dozen miles south, Benay Karp is also seeing a downturn. The owner of Benay’s Bird & Animal Rentals, she estimates the number of jobs her animals are getting is down to just 40 percent of what it was pre-pandemic. Karp specializes in small wildlife and birds, though most of her work comes from dogs and cats. Her feathered performers have appeared in Mirror Mirror and she supplied all the animals for years on Grace and Frankie. “I don’t think I’ve had a call for a woodpecker in probably three or four years, maybe five years. I have a flock of seagulls. I think I’ve only gotten one job for them in the last year, where they used to work all the time.”\n\n5. The East Wing\n\nThe East Wing of the White House has now been completely removed.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nPhotographs of the rubble that once was the East Wing of the White House went viral this week after Donald Trump had it demolished to make way for his new ballroom. Elisabeth Bumiller wrote about it. \n\n(The New York Times, approx 8 mins reading time)\n\nRelated Reads\n\nSitdown Sunday: 'This generation was bred for addiction': The toxic mix of technology and gambling\n\nSitdown Sunday: His genes meant he should've developed Alzheimer's 25 years ago.

The East Wing’s destruction prompted outrage from preservationists and Democrats, and mourning from those who once worked there. “There was never a day I didn’t catch my breath walking into the East Wing,” said Laura Schwartz, the White House director of events in the Clinton administration. “That’s what makes the loss to me so painful. It’s not just a building. It’s the living history.” “It was such a breath of fresh air from the West Wing,” said Stephanie Grisham, a White House press secretary and chief of staff to Melania Trump, the first lady, during Mr. Trump’s first term. “I hate to see that kind of history literally being demolished in front of our eyes.”\n\n6. The Goon Squad\n\nDaniel Kolitz’s bleak report on an internet-based subculture that has come about due to the combination of male loneliness and their unrestricted access to pornography. \n\n(Harper’s, approx 32 mins reading time)\n\nThose early-COVID images of depopulated city streets—these were their precise corollary. They showed you where the people went. Or where at least some of them did, likely the ones who were not exactly models of stability and robust mental health to begin with. Even so, it seemed beyond dispute that sixty years ago some of these gooners would have been fathers. Small-business owners. Dependable men in hats riding slow commuter trains, their mindscapes perfumed with thoughts of stocks, bonds, lawn care. Well, what could you do? Certain social systems had failed, certain historical trend lines had converged, and now we had these guys to deal with.\n\n…AND A CLASSIC FROM THE ARCHIVES…\n\nWhat really happened at 777 Pine Street?\n\n(Popular Mechanics, approx 32 mins reading time)\n\nOn the way out, we stopped by the windows. “There’s no way we can afford this,” Ann said, “but it would be such a cool place to have a party.” Afterward, we shook off the spell. It was impractical, too big for a family of three. But a few weeks later, the price dropped, and we asked for another look, and began a series of what-ifs and yeah-buts: If we did this, we would need to replace at least part of the roof; the furnace was ancient; and the upstairs… What was the deal with the upstairs? It was seemingly once a buttoned-​on in-law apartment, but it was now gutted down to studs and subfloor. And yet. The house was so big, we could rent out the second floor, which would cover some costs. And what if the roof really wasn’t so bad? What if the furnace held out for a winter or two? All we knew for sure was that we wanted to live in that house. Years later, I remember that I had tried to talk Ann into it, and she recalls fervently selling me on the idea. Maybe both recollections are true.\n\nNote: The Journal generally selects stories that are not paywalled, but some might not be accessible if you have exceeded your free article limit on the site in question.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.\n\nOver 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.\n\nSupport The Journal\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Sitdown Sunday: What spending three days in total darkness can do to the mind”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Sitdown Sunday: What spending three days in total darkness can do to the mind”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\n7 deadly reads\n7 great reads\n\nseven deadly reads\nseven great reads\nsitdown sunday\n\nNews in 60 seconds\n\ndone and dusted\nInside the campaign: 'I got 2,000 likes on a post about Catherine.

Obviously, Catherine’s from Galway. You walk around Galway and you see it all the time outside pubs, outside bars, outside sweet shops,” Cassidy explained.\n\nThe strategy of connecting Connolly, a fluent Irish speaker, with the country’s heritage bled into every part of the campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA sold-out musical event in Vicar Street called Ceol for Connelly included performances from iconic Irish musicians Christy Moore and the Mary Wallopers. The campaign also hosted a Connolly Céilí at the Button Factory.\n\nOne of the campaign's social media postsInstagram\n\nThe colours chosen for the campaign – greens and oranges – are reminiscent of the Irish flag, without being “very out there”.\n\nCassidy also created a version of a Celtic knot that became a recurring motif.\n\nThe Connolly campaign even collaborated with designer Aoife Cawley, whose work is inspired by folklore, mythology, and early Christian saints. She designed a special scarf.\n\nScarf by Aoife CawleyInstagram\n\nThe creative vision aligns with the recent Celtic revival particularly among middle-class young people, who became an important voter base for Connolly.\n\nCassidy, a 26-year-old renter, falls into that category.\n\nAlthough surrounded by campaigning experts with CVs that featured Repeal the Eighth and Marriage Equality, Cassidy said her youth and vision were trusted, even when they felt like a “risk”.\n\n“In a political landscape dominated by generic graphics and standardised party branding, Connolly’s campaign stands apart, distinctive, thoughtful, and unmistakably Irish,” she said.\n\n“It proves that design can tell a story, carry a message, and connect with people on both an emotional and cultural level.”\n\nCassidy thinks Connolly benefitted from having more of a “grassroots” campaign, contrasting it with those of the major parties who may have a set way of doing things. She said Connolly’s campaign “wasn’t just standard”.\n\nRelated Reads\n\nHow Catherine Connolly was able to beat the establishment and storm the presidency\n\nTaoiseach congratulates Catherine Connolly as Harris denies campaign 'backfiring'\n\nFF and FG 'need to be humble' in wake of Connolly landslide win\n\nIn the final days before polling, the Connolly team released a new Cassidy graphic on social media resembling an Irish stamp. “I’m voting for Catherine Connolly,” it says. It was aesthetically pleasing and, most importantly, shareable.\n\nThe 'stamp' graphic that reads, I'm voting for Catherine ConnollyInstagram\n\nAsked if Connolly, who has been open about her disinterest in social media, had any design input, Cassidy said: “She’s such a busy woman. The design of the campaign was not a priority at the time. The priority was getting out her message.\n\n“She had a great team behind her that would relay what she wanted to me.”\n\nConnolly secured a record number of first preference votes, giving her a historic mandate as she enters office.\n\nWe know what’s next for Connolly, but what about Cassidy? More political campaigns?\n\n“To be honest, it’s hard to know.\n\n“I was deeply interested in Catherine Connolly before she ran. She was an obvious candidate for me.”\n\nAsked if she believes her work helped get Connolly elected, Cassidy said: “I hope so. I really do hope so.”\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.\n\nOver 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.\n\nSupport The Journal\n\nMairead Maguire\n\nView 8 comments\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Designing a winning campaign: We spoke to the 26-year-old behind Catherine Connolly's graphics”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Designing a winning campaign: We spoke to the 26-year-old behind Catherine Connolly's graphics”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nThis is YOUR comments community.

Nor did the then 81-year-old raise the issue with her.\n\nIn the book, 107 Days, the former vice-president wrote that Biden's decision to run again was a choice that shouldn't have \"been left to an individual's ego, an individual's ambition\". She wrote that \"perhaps\" she should have raised it with him.\n\nIn this interview she told the BBC that she still ponders whether she should have acted differently and talked to him about it.\n\n\"I do reflect on whether I should have had a conversation with him, urging him not to run.\" She said \"my concern, especially on reflection is, should I have actually raised it\". She questioned whether it was \"grace or recklessness\" that stopped her speaking up.\n\nHer worry, she added, was not Biden's capacity to do the job of commander in chief but about whether he would meet the demands of a gruelling election campaign to stay in the White House.\n\nWhen pressed on why there is a distinction, she said there was a serious difference between running for the office and conducting the duties of being president. And running against Trump is even more demanding, she said.\n\nShe said she had a \"concern about his [Biden's] ability, with the level of endurance, energy, that it requires, especially running against the now current president\".\n\nThe former vice-president said it was hard for her to speak up because she risked being accused of promoting her own political interests if she had confronted Biden about his health.\n\n\"Part of the issue there was that it would – would it have actually been an effective and productive conversation, given what would otherwise appear to be my self-interest?\"\n\nThe issue of whether more people in Biden's circle could have challenged him about the wisdom of him running again has become a major talking point.\n\nOne book, Original Sin by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, alleged that people close to him covered up his physical deterioration from the public.\n\nBiden's aides have pushed back at the allegation, saying there were physical changes as he got older but no evidence of mental incapacity and nothing that affected his ability to do the job.\n\nIn his first interview after leaving the White House, in May of this year, Biden told the BBC it would not have mattered if he had left the race any earlier.\n\nHis former vice-president is in the UK promoting her new book. In a wide-ranging conversation for the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Harris also said it was \"possible\" she could run for the White House again.\n\nShe has already ruled out running for governor in her home state, California, and the former prosecutor told the BBC she was \"not done\" with public service.","summary":"Former US Vice-President Kamala Harris has expressed concern that she didn't ask Joe Biden to pull out of the race for the White House.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/harris-expresses-concern-she-did-not-ask-biden-not-to-run/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-11-21.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-26 07:46:16","author":"Emmanuel Tetteh,Jake Tapper","authors":["Emmanuel Tetteh","Jake Tapper"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.32},{"id":372637866,"title":"Kamala Harris reflects on why she did not ask Biden to quit sooner","text":"In the book, 107 Days, the former vice-president wrote that Biden's decision to run again was a choice that shouldn't have \"been left to an individual's ego, an individual's ambition\".
