Afterward, she gave a mocking side-eye glance before mumbling some words, which lip reader NJ Hickling interpreted.\n\nThe pop diva sat next to rapper Ice Spice at the Super Bowl and muttered the following words per the Daily Mail, “Aww what, what’s going on?”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nTo make matters worse for Swift, her boyfriend, Travis Kelce’s team, the Kansas City Chiefs, were heavily outclassed on the night and lost 40-22 to the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThere was more misery to follow for the “Blank Space” singer as POTUS Trump mocked her for being booed.\n\nTaking to his Truth Social account, the president wrote, “The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!”\n\nHowever, Trump’s attempt to troll Swift was met with heavy backlash from fans who reminded him that he was also booed at the Super Bowl.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe Shade Room reposted Trump’s post about Swift on its Instagram page, and many fans took turns sharing their thoughts about the president.\n\nOne fan reminded the president that it wasn’t just Swift who got booed at the Super Bowl. They wrote, “It’s the fact that he’s acting like HE didn’t IN FACT get booed at the game!! I’m not sure what it sounded like on TV….But I was at the game and they Definitely BOOED him too!! VERY LOUD!!!!”\n\nAnother fan echoed similar sentiments, writing, “They booed him too. But he’s deflecting… and they didn’t show that part.”\n\nMeanwhile, other fans wondered why Trump was so “obsessed” with Swift. One of them wrote, “He made THREE posts about her tonight by the way… the obsession the president of the USA has with her is very weird.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAnother fan added, “Y’all don’t see anything wrong with this???? Like seriously! Is this not embarrassing to y’all?… the president, beefing with a pop star! This country is so messed up! It’s sad!”\n\nA fifth person felt that Trump was only seeking attention through his antics. They wrote, “He wants everything to be about him.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nTrump’s latest attempt to ridicule Swift adds to their heated history. The US President has never shied away from expressing his dislike of the 35-year-old singer.\n\nIn September 2024, he wrote via Truth Social, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” The post earned him severe backlash from Swifties, who defended their queen in their multitudes.\n\nAs the 2024 presidential elections drew closer, Swift endorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, unsurprisingly earning her more hate from Trump.\n\nThe then-Republican presidential candidate called into “Fox & Friends” and said he preferred Kelce’s teammate Patrick Mahomes’ wife, Brittany Mahomes, to Swift.\n\nTrump said, “I actually like Mrs. Mahomes much better if you want to know the truth.” He also claimed that Brittany was a “big Trump fan.”\n\nDespite Trump’s best efforts to rile Swift up, she has hardly ever responded to him, reminding everyone of just how graceful she is.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSwift won’t be paying any mind to whatever Trump says. Instead, she will do her best to console and motivate her boyfriend, Kelce.\n\nThe Chiefs suffered a heavy defeat at the Eagles’ hands after a rather woeful display that saw them losing 34-0 at one point.\n\nFootage from Entertainment Tonight showed Kelce walking through the stadium’s hallways in his retro 1970s-inspired pregame outfit and heading to Swift’s suite.\n\nQuestions about the tight end’s NFL future still abound and will grow in volume after the Chiefs loss.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump reignited his feud with Taylor Swift following the Super&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump Mocks Taylor Swift After She Receives Booing at the Super Bowl first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/entertainment/donald-trump-mocks-taylor-swift-after-she-receives-booing-at-the-super-bowl/","image":"https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/brand-img/123/0x0/2024/05/30184929/President-Donald-Trump.jpg?","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-11 00:38:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":289139866,"title":"I Saw Taylor Swift Get Booed at the Super Bowl First Hand and It Felt Bigger Than the Game","text":"To me, the disparate reactions felt like a message. That the Super Bowl, one of the biggest cultural events in the country, has been reclaimed by Trump and the type of toxic masculinity he appears to be the beacon of. And he and his supporters seem to be living for it.\n\nJust look at the president’s response shortly after he left the game. Not only did he acknowledge that Swift was booed by the crowd, he delighted in it. As he had many, many times before (including saying he “hated” Swift after she endorsed his 2024 rival Kamala Harris) the president weaponized his massive following against her.\n\n“The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift,” Trump the president wrote on Truth Social. “She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!”\n\nBy calling her out, Trump looked to play by the now-standard internet misogyny playbook. It wasn’t enough that Swift was publicly mocked, now he needed to troll her about it, attempting to humiliate her even further. We all got normalized to this sort of conduct in 2016, when the president mocking his apparent enemies on Twitter became a near daily occurrence (surely he has something better to do, right?). But it’s still worth calling out how gross—and frankly ridiculous—this sort of conduct is. And when the Twitter rant becomes real life, in the form of a stadium full of thousands and thousands of people, it’s chilling. The online bullies of 2016 are now, in 2025, very real.\n\nIt’s important to place these two moments in the context in which they exist. Though there are nuances to both, Trump and Swift exemplify two factions of American culture currently struggling for dominance.\n\nEver since Swift started dating Kelce in 2023 and started coming to his NFL games, our cultural conversation around the sport has shifted radically. Suddenly, football—especially the Chiefs—was for the girls. Women’s interest in the sport skyrocketed, and a spokesperson for the NFL told me the league grew its following among women by 21% from 2023 to 2024. Women began to watch the game, follow the players and WAGs (sports content by women creators has grown 40% year on year, according to YouTube) and buy merch (you couldn’t walk through the street this weekend in New Orleans without being enticed to buy a “go Taylor’s boyfriend” or “in my Chiefs era” T-shirt).\n\nAccording to Market Watch, Swift is estimated to have brought nearly $1 billion in brand value to the league since she started dating Kelce, and has elevated other women in the NFL in the process. As I wrote last year, interest in the wives and girlfriends of NFL players has also become a huge part of the sport (one which the league, by the way, enthusiastically embraces), and several WAGs like Chanen Johnson and Chariah Gordon have become bonafide internet stars. In fact, the entire reason I traveled to the Super Bowl in the first place was to cover the WAGs and Swift for Glamour and YouTube, from the game day fashion to the cultural moments during the game and the surrounding events (I, honestly, could have cared less about the actual game play from a journalistic standpoint).","summary":"To me, the disparate reactions felt like a message.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries sent a letter to his Democratic colleagues announcing the establishment of a “Rapid Response Task Force and Litigation Working Group.”\n\n“We are engaged in a multifaceted struggle to protect and defend everyday Americans from the harm being inflicted by this administration,” he wrote in the letter. “As outlined last week, it’s an all hands on deck effort simultaneously underway in Congress, the Courts and the Community.” \n\nAs The Independent reported last week, this comes after plenty of Democratic voters and activists have expressed frustration at the apparently lackadaisical approach Democrats have taken. Mostly, Democratic activists want to know: what are Democrats going to do about what’s happening? Especially after they had spent the last year and a half calling Trump either a fascist at worst or a threat to democracy at best. \n\nBut as much as Democrats might want to resist Trump, they have precious few tools available to push back against them. \n\nFor one, they control neither the House nor the Senate. Although Republicans have only three more seats than Democrats in the House, in the majoritarian body, that’s enough to steamroll Democrats. Republicans’ biggest worry there is getting everyone on the same page.\n\nAs far as the Senate, Democrats are no longer able to filibuster cabinet nominees like Vought ever since former Senate majority leader Harry Reid invoked the “nuclear option” for cabinet and judicial nominees after Republicans repeatedly filibustered Barack Obama’s nominees. \n\nThen-majority leader Mitch McConnell extended that to Supreme Court nominees when Democrats filibustered Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court after he blocked Merrick Garland from even having a hearing.\n\nThat leaves Democrats with fewer options than they have had in the past to battle Trump. \n\nAlso, there are fewer Republicans willing to oppose Trump’s nominees, something Democrats saw when only McConnell as well as Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against confirming Pete Hegseth to be secretary of Defense.\n\nNow Democrats will mostly have to rely on the courts. Just today, a federal judge blocked Trump from sending Venezuelan migrants to Guantanamo Bay. Another judge said on Monday that Trump had not fully followed his order to unfreeze federal spending. \n\nBut Democrats have two other weapons they still might be able to wield against Republicans to stop Trump: the debt limit and the federal budget showdown. \n\nHistorically, Republicans have used the debt limit to extract spending cuts from Democratic presidents when they control the House or Senate. In the same vein, when the federal government runs out of money next month, Democrats could filibuster the federal budget if they choose to.\n\nThis go-around, Democrats might be able to use the fact that plenty of Republicans will always oppose raising the debt limit and oppose any kind of spending agreement to their advantage to get Mike Johnson to agree to at least some concessions lest a government shutdown happens under Trump’s watch. \n\nIt might not be the kind of grand gestures that Democratic voters want. But these are likely the best tools that Democrats have if they’re prepared to put up a fight against Trump.","summary":"Democrats don’t have many tools to stop Trump’s agenda.

Should I kick off with the Albanian criminal who has avoided deportation because his son won’t eat ‘foreign’ chicken nuggets?\n\nOr home in on the Pakistani paedophile, jailed for child sex offences, who has been allowed to stay in Britain because to kick him out would be a breach of his family’s right to a father?\n\nLet’s start with the chicken nuggets case, one of the most inventive excuses yet for avoiding deportation under the European yuman rites act.\n\nAnd, to be fair, we’ve had a few oustanding contenders in the past, including the illegal immigrant from Bolivia who was granted right to remain because he had joint custody of a cat and therefore was entitled to a ‘family life’ in Britain.\n\nMore recently, a Jamaican drug dealer jailed five times in Britain escaped being sent home because his daughter ‘may be trans’.\n\nYou couldn’t make it up.\n\nAlbanian Klevis Disha came to the UK as an unaccompanied minor, using a false name and claiming to have been born in the former Yugoslavia, which he wasn’t.\n\nHe married another Albanian, who had gained UK citizenship, and they had two daughters and a son. In September 2017, he was jailed for two years after being caught with £250,000 in cash, known to be the proceeds of crime.\n\nDisha’s appeal against deportation was granted by an immigration court judge because it would be ‘unduly harsh’ on his 10-year old son, who had a distaste for ‘the type of chicken nuggets that are available abroad’.\n\nAdmittedly, this was just one aspect of his grounds for appeal. The court also heard that the boy had ‘sensory difficulties’ with certain items of clothing, socks in particular, and despite having been born and grown up in Britain, his first language is Albanian.\n\nIn which case, you might think, he’d have no problem adapting to life in Albania. If he doesn’t like they way they cook chicken nuggets, tough. Since when have chicken nuggets been one of your five-a-day? And no one can force him to wear socks if he doesn’t want to. Going sockless is quite fashionable these days.\n\nThis case has now been bumped back to the court after an appeal by the Home Office. But it only serves to demonstrate the extent to which the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is regularly abused by migrants and foreign criminals who have no right to be in Britain and the shameless Left-wing lawyers queueing up to represent them.\n\nM’learned friends protest that under the ‘cab rank’ principle they have an obligation to argue their clients’ cases, however absurd or incredible. But, as I have remarked before, that depends on where you park your cab. There’s a good living to be made specialising in yuman rites.\n\nA Pakistani man who was jailed for 18 months after being caught in a police sting operation for targeting ‘barely pubescent’ girls for sex is the latest to avoid deportation under the ECHR.\n\nThe court ruled that returning him to Pakistan would breach his family’s rights to a father. This is despite the fact that since his conviction he has been banned from living with his own two young children.\n\nHe is on the sex offenders register and is forbidden from using social media to contact underage girls. The court also heard that there was ‘very little prospect’ of him being rehabilitated.\n\nHis only excuse for his behaviour was that his wife had gone off sex after contracting Covid. Not the only one, I’d imagine, but hardly justification for her husband to seek gratification from 13-year-old girls.\n\nYet, regardless of all this damning evidence, the judge decided that it would be ‘unduly harsh for the children to be without their father’.\n\nSometimes words fail even me.\n\nThe Home Office is appealing, but I wouldn’t hold your breath. The prospect of any of these rulings being overturned is pretty remote.\n\nThe Tories lacked the courage to pull us out of the pernicious European yuman rites racket when they had the chance. And nor is there any likelihood of Britain withdrawing from the ECHR while Labour is in power.\n\nSurkeir Starmer, our Prime Minister, is a complete and utter lawyer, who cut his teeth on human rights cases. All you need to know about this Left-wing rabble’s concept of justice is that Starmer appointed as Attorney General one of his best mates, ‘Lord’ Harmer, another yuman rites specialist in thrall to international law, who has represented the saintly Gerry Adams against the British Government, among others.\n\nDon’t forget that Tony Blair described his decision to incorporate the ECHR in Britain as his proudest achievement in politics.\n\nGiven the size of Labour’s majority, we can expect more of the same over the next four years – Pakistani paedos allowed to stay in Britain because they have the right to a ‘family life’, and an Albanian gangster escaping deportation on the grounds that his son has an aversion to socks and doesn’t like foreign chicken nuggets.\n\nDo you want fries with that?\n\nMental Elf is the new bad back, the default excuse of the modern skiver.\n\nEven Liz Kendall, the Work and Pensions Secretary, says that many benefits claimants – among them 850,000 claiming mental health ishoos – are ‘taking the mickey’.\n\nYou could say that. Thirty seven per cent of all new benefit claims – 20,000 a month – are from young adults, seeking disability payments for ‘anxiety’ and related complaints.\n\nBut when Oliver Freeston, a Reform UK councillor in North East Lincolnshire, expressed a similar opinion he was hauled over the coals.\n\nHe told a committee meeting that the easiest way to claim benefits was to feign a mental health problem – ‘It’s the 21st-century version of the bad back’ – because, like a bad back, it was difficult to disprove.\n\nAfterwards, he received an email from a ‘compliance officer’ warning him to ‘moderate his language’ or face disciplinary proceedings.\n\nWhat, for stating the bleedin’ obvious?\n\nSounds to me like former NHS worker 25-year-old Oliver is exactly the kind of individual we need in politics. If, by some miracle, Reform wins the next election, Nigel Farage should have him nailed on as Work and Pensions Secretary.\n\nCome to think of it, my back’s giving me a bit of gyp. Do you think I’ve got a claim for Mental Elf ishoos?\n\nLabour too Swift to trash Trump\n\nJust as I predicted on Saturday, Donald Trump got a rousing reception at the Super Bowl in New Orleans. Not so Taylor Swift, who was booed when her image appeared on the big screen.\n\nSwift backed the hapless Kamala Harris against Trump during the presidential election. So, too, did Britain’s Labour Party, which sent 100 staff to campaign for Harris. At the same time, the Government laid on a police motorcade escort for Taylor Swift – in exchange for free tickets to her Wembley concerts.\n\nLabour’s hostility towards Trump is well known, no matter how much they try reversing the ferret now. Talk about backing the wrong horse. No doubt Surkeir had a few quid on the Kansas City Chiefs to win the Super Bowl, too.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDays like this, as I have had occasion to remark more than&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: How can foreign criminals use CHICKEN NUGGETS to seek asylum? first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/how-can-foreign-criminals-use-chicken-nuggets-to-seek-asylum/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/10/17/95063475-14381323-image-a-10_1739208509174.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-10 22:20:05","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":289118276,"title":"Frustrated Democrats Near Their Tea Party Moment: 'This Is Not Okay'","text":"There is a rumbling coming from deep inside the Democratic Party.Right past the party's most recognizable faces and Congressional leaders, below than the despair and ennui over President Donald Trump's decisive victory, outraged liberals are beginning to grumble — in group chats and podcasts, on X and BlueSky — about how to intervene against the party they have called home for decades and which, they believe, has failed its voters so spectacularly over the past year.Fed up with the party leadership's response to Trump's swift upending of the federal bureaucracy and administrative state, Democratic voters are preparing for their own watershed moment as they chart a path to take matters into their own hands—much like conservatives did some 16 years ago when they took aim at mainstream Republicans in the wake of the global financial crisis, birthing what became known as the Tea Party movement.Fueled by their opposition to government bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis, the Tea Party gained significant momentum after the Democratic-controlled Senate and House passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Conservatives saw their Republican leaders as not doing enough to fight then-President Barack Obama's liberal policies. What began as a grassroots movement would go onto upend the GOP, reshape conservatives in the U.S. and ultimately, pave the way for Trump's rise in 2016.Now, it's Democrats who are in need of their own grassroots shakeup.\"You have a lot of outrage among the base voters, and not many places to channel it through just yet,\" Lakshya Jain, a political data analyst and co-founder of the election-modeling website Split Ticket, told Newsweek.\"I think there is a real risk of Democrats being hit with a Tea Party-esque insurgency in 2026. Not in terms of a 'burn it all down with lunatics' mentality, but more of a 'our lawmakers are badly out of sync with our base,'\" Jain wrote on X last week.Liberals are growing increasingly frustrated by their leaders, who some see as coming across \"tone deaf\" and failing to meet the moment of Trump's swift upending of federal bureaucracy in his first three weeks in office.That frustration manifested itself in the online response to a video clip that circulated last week showing Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the party's top elected official, leading chants of \"We will win!\" months after suffering one of the biggest Democratic losses in decades. Many progressives expressed puzzlement at how the party had failed to conduct a proper autopsy on the last election cycle.\"Democrats, can you please stop f---ing trotting Schumer out there?\" Jon Stewart said during Tuesday's episode of \"The Daily Show.\"\"I don't dislike Schumer, but as the visual representative of the democratic party, we are f---ed,\" Mark Horvath, a housing advocate, wrote in a post responding to the clip.Sick and tired, some Democrats are beginning to entertain ideas of abandoning the party as they know it in favor of finding a new way of getting their voices heard. And if the party fails to grasp how deep the groundswell of support for younger leaders with a more coherent message against Trump, whispers of drafting primary challengers have already begun.\"It's going to happen a lot quicker than most leaders within the party are prepared for, because things are not okay,\" Brad Bauman, principal at the Raben Group and the former executive director of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told Newsweek. \"The conversations that I'm having with people are, 'Do we save the infrastructure that we have, or do we build something new?'\"When Vice President Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate, many progressives cheered. They saw it as a sign that the Democratic Party, for once, was listening to their voters and not their strategists, who wanted Harris to play to swing voters with a more centrist pick like Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.The appeal to left-leaning voters was why the Harris-Walz ticket \"started winning when they started calling Republicans weird, and lost when they pivoted to centrist bland messaging,\" author Andrew Hickey said on Bluesky. Other users on the left-leaning platform echoed those remarks, arguing it was their embrace of anti-Trump Republicans that slowed the pair's momentum.\"He had the right idea to just call them f---ing weirdos and they made him stop,\" one user said of Walz.Democratic voters are also still licking their wounds over the lack of action from their leaders over Trump's attempts to dismantle the federal bureaucracy, especially since Republicans broadcast the ideas in a nearly 900-page detailed plan ahead of the elecxtion.\"Project 2025 was known about for years. So, why wasn't anyone thinking, 'Well just in case he wins, here's our plan to stop it'?\" Democratic strategist Keith Edwards asked. \"Donald Trump is not a new idea, and [Democrats] certainly had a roadmap for what he wanted to do when in office. For some reason, it seems like our leadership has been surprised that he's doing what he said he was going to do.\"As one user on Bluesky pointed out, \"If only they had laid out a plan, a project if you will, of what they would do if he took office in 2025. Imagine if they published it and Kamala Harris, Tim Walz and everyone that opposed him told you about the plan before the election.\"\"If our elected leaders are not prepared to step up, show up and show the American people what we stand for, then they need to get out of the way and let another group of folks do it,\" Bauman said.On Tuesday, Reform DNC, a group whose stated mission is to \"revitalize the Democratic party, empower its members, and create a party that truly represents the people's interests,\" told users on Bluesky: \"Every single democrat that is outrage right now needs to start participating in your local democratic clubs and committees. The people in charge no longer understand the urgency of now. Too many think if they wait it out they'll come back to power. ACT NOW.

Flat out.\"\"The Democratic Party needs to be able to fundamentally address its strategic and fundamental issues, while at the same time mount a real resistance to the slow-motion coup we're watching Elon Musk and Donald Trump perpetuate on our government right now,\" he said. \"We simply don't have the time to do one and then the other. We have to be able to do both at the same time.\"Edwards told Newsweek that efforts are already beginning.\"There are definitely very talented, well-connected Democrats who understand the problem and are figuring out a way to fix it,\" he said.One of the biggest issues Edwards has with the party is their unwillingness to leave the \"narrative of institutions\" behind in favor of telling real human stories that are unfolding as a result of Trump's policies.\"We need to be the defender of people, not the defender of institutions,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, no one cares that some federal employees are going to get fired. No one cares that [Trump's] not going through whatever [legislative] process they need to go through to make this stuff happen.\"He urged his party to engage with more social media content that's already being put out there about the consequences of Trump's actions. In the wake of the president's sweeping and legally tenuous halt on federal funds, some moms have taken to TikTok to share videos of themselves crying over concerns that they no longer have food stamps to provide for their children. Edwards is demanding to know why Democrats aren't using these \"compelling\" stories that can cut through the noise.\"Republicans have figured out that it's not really about the doing, it's about the people that it's being done to, whether that be true or not,\" Edwards said. \"They've made a great bit of success by speaking people's hearts. Democrats are so brainy, and I love that about us, but people respond when you speak to their heart, not when you speak to their brain.\"Jain, of Split Ticket, said it will be difficult for the current state of affairs not to trigger an uprising within the party because its leaders can't give their voters what they're demanding, solely based on the fact that they have little power in Congress. So, they have no choice but to let \"that type of anger then manifest itself.\"\"The election is over, they lost, and as a liberal myself, that sucks, but we lost,\" Jain said. \"It's hard because there's a whole a bunch of infighting in the party.

Kevin Cramer, a key Trump ally who co-chairs the bipartisan American Canadian economy and security caucus.\n\nThe Ontarian will make a second visit to the U.S. capital on Feb. 20 to discuss the trade crisis with delegates to the National Governors’ Association winter conference.\n\nHis two trips are coming in the middle of a snap Feb. 27 election Ford triggered because he wanted a new four-year mandate to “outlive and outlast” the Trump administration.\n\nRevving up for his unusual stateside push, Ford was taking aim at China on Monday.\n\nThe PC leader said he would ban Chinese parts from energy projects and prohibit participation by any Chinese state-owned enterprises in critical mineral or infrastructure projects if elected to a third term.\n\nTrump’s latest scheme to place 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminum — despite a pledge last week to hold off on any levies until March — shows why Ontario must be flexible, Ford told reporters in Oakville after a fundraising breakfast.\n\n“We’re going to face this for four years, shifting goalposts constantly and constant chaos,” he said.\n\nWhile he has focused his campaign on fighting tariffs, he suffered a setback a week ago when he was caught on a “hot mic” saying that he “100 per cent” supported Trump to win the November U.S. election over Kamala Harris.\n\n“We’re in a battle for the future of our economy,” Ford said Monday, emphasizing it’s crucial to convince Americans that U.S.-Canada economic co-operation is the best way to meet trade threats from China and put Trump off his talk of making Canada the 51st state.\n\n“I’m going to tell them exactly what I’m telling you, Ontario is taking action to secure our border and delivering results.”\n\nPreviously planned moves to take U.S. spirits, wines and beers off LCBO shelves and ban American companies from major contracts remain on hold for now, the PC leader said.\n\n“Let’s first see what he’s going do to,” he added, sending a signal south of the border that Canada as a whole has a plan for a “hard” response.\n\n“We are not going to roll over. There’s one thing that President Trump has underestimated — the will of the Canadian people,” said Ford.\n\n“We never started a fight we don’t want. But when someone you know gives you a pop in the nose, they’re going to get that pop twice as hard back.”\n\nIn Toronto, Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie said the tough talk from Ford is ironic given the Tory’s professed admiration for Trump in last week’s headline-grabbing gaffe.\n\nCrombie noted the president campaigned on placing tariffs on Canada and Mexico during the U.S. election. \n\nHer Liberals are airing television ads they hope will draw widespread public attention to that and eat into Ford’s current lead in public opinion polls.\n\n“We’re showing him for who he is, someone who wanted a self-serving election,” said Crombie, whose campaign has been mostly about improving health care by guaranteeing every Ontarian access to a family doctor.\n\n“You don’t see another premier who would think of calling an election at a time of crisis, when we’re responding to a tariff threat, and a president who wants to wage a trade war and our premier supports that president,” she said.\n\nNew Democrat Leader Marit Stiles, who met with steelworkers in Hamilton on Monday morning after highlighting her push for a higher nurse-to-patient ratio in hospitals to improve care, said Ford is exploiting the trade crisis to divert attention from pressing issues on the home front. \n\n“Doug Ford doesn’t want to talk about the fact that people in Ontario are losing their family members in hallways in our hospitals because there aren’t enough beds and there aren’t enough nurses,” Stiles told supporters in Port Colborne before taking a shot at Ford’s support for Trump.\n\n“Doug Ford has shown us what he’s made of,” she added. “I don’t think we can trust Doug Ford to stand up for Ontarians and to protect all our jobs and defend our workers and our communities.” \n\nAlong with Green Leader Mike Schreiner, the party chiefs are gearing up for a Friday debate on northern issues in North Bay and another next Monday night in Toronto at the CBC Broadcast Centre.","summary":"The Progressive Conservative leader said he would ban Chinese parts from energy projects and ban participation by any Chinese state-owned enterprises in critical mineral or infrastructure projects.","url":"https://www.thestar.com/politics/provincial/doug-ford-talks-tough-on-china-ahead-of-washington-trip-to-fight-donald-trumps-tariffs/article_8e2e2a8a-e7ce-11ef-97c4-bb9f7eff0f59.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/55/c550c60c-b9bb-56d7-9ae9-2cd193f3a56e/67aa3dedebdbd.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-10 21:45:00","author":"Kristin Rushowy,Rob Ferguson,Robert Benzie","authors":["Kristin Rushowy","Rob Ferguson","Robert Benzie"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.114},{"id":289110148,"title":"Taylor Swift hides under umbrellas as she makes her secret escape from New Orleans after Travis Kelce's Super Bowl heartache","text":"BREAKING NEWSTaylor Swift hides under umbrellas as she makes her secret escape from New Orleans after Travis Kelce's Super Bowl heartache\n\nREAD MORE: Incredible graphic shows hundreds of jets leaving the Super Bowl \n\nBy JAKE FENNER\n\nPublished: 21:06 GMT, 10 February 2025 | Updated: 21:43 GMT, 10 February 2025\n\nThe umbrella army has returned for pop superstar Taylor Swift, who was spotted leaving New Orleans in the aftermath of a crushing defeat for her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, in the Super Bowl.\n\nSwift had a bit of a tough evening at Super Bowl LIX - getting booed heartily by the fans in attendance, facing the wrath of President Trump on social media, and then watching Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs suffer a humiliating defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThe 'Look What You Made Me Do' star pulled up to her parked private jet at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport on the Monday after the Big Game and was protected by a legion of people holding umbrellas as she boarded the plane so she couldn't be spotted.\n\nSwift's plane sat on the runway for 45 minutes before taxiing and taking off from the Big Easy. \n\nBefore boarding, a man appeared to carry on some snacks and a tub of cat litter - suggesting that the pop icon may have brought her cats along with her. \n\nShe had brought friends - including rapper Ice Spice - along with her in the hopes of watching Kelce and the Chiefs clinch a third-straight Super Bowl title.\n\nAn army of umbrellas protects Taylor Swift as she boards her private jet in New Orleans\n\nThe pop icon made her way onto the plane to depart after Super Bowl LIX at the Superdome\n\nSnacks and cat litter appeared to be carried onto Swift's jet as well before she departed\n\nInstead, it was her hometown Eagles that came away with a dominant 40-22 win that was much more lopsided than the score suggests.\n\nDuring the proceedings, Swift was shown on the jumbotron at the Caesars Superdome - wherein she was loudly booed by fans in attendance.\n\nShe appeared to look confused before laughing and turning to her friends.\n\nLater in the night, after the game had ended, President Trump - who had left the game early - decided to twist the knife.\n\nAmong the 47th President's complaints about the game that he posted to Truth Social was a jab aimed at Swift.\n\n'The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!,' the President wrote.\n\nEarlier in the week, Kelce said that he was 'a great honor' to have Trump there - which may have come as a surprise considering Trump repeatedly bashed Swift in public after she supported his opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Philadelphia, the celebrations are getting underway - with a massive victory parade planned for this Friday.\n\nThe plane sat on the runway for 45 minutes before taxiing and then taking off on Monday\n\nSwift arrived in a black SUV before being quickly ushered onto the plane for takeoff\n\nSwift had a rough evening - being booed loudly by fans and watching Travis Kelce lose\n\nNot only that, but President Trump twisted the knife by mocking her on social media afterwards\n\nSuper Bowl MVP Jalen Hurts is having a celebration of his own at Walt Disney World in Florida, as is custom for the game's most valuable player.\n\nThe Eagles took an early lead and never looked back - not trailing once throughout the entire contest.\n\nBy halftime, the lead had grown to 24-0 and the Chiefs showed little signs of life.\n\nIt wasn't until the fourth quarter where Kansas City truly started to get their feet under them, but by then it was too late.\n\nTravis KelceTaylor Swift\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nTaylor Swift hides under umbrellas as she makes her secret escape from New Orleans after Travis Kelce's Super Bowl heartache\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The umbrella army has returned for pop superstar Taylor Swift, who was spotted leaving New Orleans in the aftermath of a crushing defeat for her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, in the Super Bowl.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-14382283/taylor-swift-leaves-new-orleans-super-bowl-travis-kelce.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/10/21/95069753-0-image-a-115_1739221843689.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-10 21:43:55","author":"Editor,Jake Fenner","authors":["Editor","Jake Fenner"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.012},{"id":289113088,"title":"Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas' daughter Carys shares rare glimpse of college life in new video","text":"Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas' daughter Carys is not falling far behind them when it comes to talent.\n\nThe No Reservations actress and the Fatal Attraction actor's youngest daughter is currently a student at Brown University, and recently gave a glimpse of her life at college, along with a peek of her piano skills.\n\nIn addition to Carys, 21, the two Oscar winners, who have been married since 2000, also share a son, Dylan Douglas, 24, who graduated from Brown in 2022.\n\nOn Monday, February 10, Carys took to Instagram and shared on her Stories a video of her practicing her piano skills in what appears to be a classroom at Brown.\n\nShe is seen in the clip with tousled wavy hair, sporting a green sweater, and she is attentively and passionately playing the piano.\n\nIn addition to what appears to be a budding, possible music career, Carys has also ventured into acting. \n\nShe made her screen debut in the 2024 short F*ck That Guy, which featured You star Victoria Pedretti, and in 2022, she was also a second assistant director in another short, titled August.\n\nMeanwhile, her older brother, who has also dabbled in acting, recently launched a podcast with SiriusXM, Young America, through which he intends to both inform and motivate his generation when it comes to the political issues impacting their future.\n\nThe show, which releases new episodes on Saturdays, launched in September, in time for the election between former Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.\n\nIn an Instagram post at the time announcing the new venture, Dylan wrote: \"It's been a wild ride the last couple of years.

This newsletter has published them before, but here are a few excerpts from James’s statements during her 2018 campaign and after.\n\n“This illegitimate president who sits in the White House … he’s not my president, he’s an illegitimate president. His days are numbered. His days are numbered. … We’ve got to be ready to mobilize, and we’ve got to get ready to agitate and irritate until victory is won or, more importantly, until Trump is defeated. … We will all rise up and resist this man … and ultimately we’ll bring him down. … I’m going to give [Trump] the same level of respect that [Trump] gave President Obama, and that is absolutely no respect at all. … Donald Trump has got to go. Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Donald Trump has got to go! … The days of Trump are numbered.”\n\nJames rode the anti-Trump train to reelection in 2022. And now, with Trump back in the White House, you will not be surprised to learn that she is again leading the lawfare charge against the president. Although it did not keep Trump out of the White House, James’s lawfare has nonetheless done him plenty of damage — so why not try it again?\n\nLate Friday, James’s office posted a press release headlined, “Attorney General James Leads Multistate Coalition in Suing to Stop Elon Musk and DOGE’s Attacks on Americans.” James said she and the attorneys general of 18 other states, all Democrats, of course, had sued Trump, the Treasury Department, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to “stop the unauthorized disclosure of Americans’ private information and sensitive data.”\n\nNote at the beginning that James & Co. do not know whether there has been any unauthorized disclosure of people’s private information and sensitive data. But they have read some media articles suggesting such disclosure could happen. That was enough for James. Joining the suit are the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin, for a total, with New York, of 19 states. With a few exceptions, that’s pretty much all the states won by former Vice President Kamala Harris last November now going to war against the winner of the election.\n\nLate Friday night, James & Co. asked a judge in New York, U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer, to issue an emergency temporary restraining order to stop Trump-designated special government employee Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency team from looking into the payment practices of the Treasury Department. The DOGE group, in particular, a 25-year-old engineer named Marko Elez, was “granted access” to the super-sensitive Treasury payment system, according to the request. “Notably, Elez spent several days with ‘administrator privilege access’ with the ability to overwrite code,” James and her colleagues said. Such access, they added, endangered the government’s payments to people for “Social Security benefits, veterans benefits, childcare tax credits, federal employee wages, and federal tax refunds.”\n\nThe James request listed three sources for the allegation that Elez was given “administrator privilege access,” that is, the power to change code in the Treasury Department system. The first source was a floor speech given by Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY), the second was a post on BlueSky in which Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) said “sources” had told him DOGE had full access to the Treasury system, and the third source was an article in Wired magazine.\n\nOf course, top Trump administration officials, including Bessent, denied that that had happened, and they strongly argued that the various payments to people had not only not been interfered with but were not in any danger. The DOGE scare, they said, was a Democratic and media overreaction to a much-needed critical review of federal spending.\n\nJames did one more thing. She asked Engelmayer to issue the restraining order without even hearing from the administration. She requested the order under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(B). According to that rule, a court “may issue a temporary restraining order without written or oral notice to the adverse party or its attorney only if specific facts in an affidavit or a verified complaint clearly show that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the movant before the adverse party can be heard in opposition.” The rule also required James to certify that she made at least some sort of effort to tell the other side about her action.\n\nEngelmayer apparently found all this — Schumer’s speech, Wyden’s post, the Wired article — extremely persuasive. In the space of a few short hours, he decided that the Trump administration must immediately be stopped. James & Co. filed the request with Engelmayer about 9:30 p.m. Friday. Engelmayer issued the restraining order around 1 a.m. Saturday. It was all very, very urgent.\n\nEngelmayer’s decision raised questions — and eyebrows. He ruled that Trump, the Treasury Department, and Bessent were “restrained from granting access to any Treasury Department payment record, payment systems, or any other data systems maintained by the Treasury Department … other than to civil servants with a need for access to perform their job duties.” He then forbade Trump, the Treasury Department, and Bessent from granting access to records to “all political appointees, special government employees, and government employees detailed from an agency outside the Treasury Department.”\n\nWhy did Engelmayer decree that some “civil servants” be given access to Treasury’s systems but not “political appointees”? On its face, that would apply to Bessent and his top deputies, all appointed by Trump — in other words, all the people now running the Treasury Department. Depending on how you count political appointees, Engelmayer’s ban applies to at least the top 35 people in the Treasury Department, and possibly more.\n\nThe Trump side finally got to respond on Sunday night. “There is not and cannot be a basis for distinguishing between ‘civil servants’ and ‘political appointees,'” administration lawyers wrote. “Basic democratic accountability requires that every executive agency’s work be supervised by politically accountable leadership, who ultimately answer to the president. A federal court, consistent with the separation of powers, cannot insulate any portion of that work from the specter of political accountability. No court can issue an injunction that directly severs the clear line of supervision Article II requires. Because the order on its face draws an impermissible and anti-constitutional distinction, it should be dissolved immediately.”\n\nIt’s not that complicated. Authority in the executive branch ultimately has to derive from an election. The executive branch is the only branch of government headed by a single person, the president. The president is elected and then appoints people to run the executive branch. If there are “civil servants” who have authority denied to the president’s representatives, then who is in charge of the executive branch? One might ask that question of Engelmayer, who appears to think some functions of the executive branch are so sensitive they can only be performed by “civil servants” and not by political appointees, including the treasury secretary and his deputies.\n\nWhatever the weaknesses in Engelmayer’s thinking, the administration made clear in its response that it was obeying the judge’s order. “To be clear, notwithstanding the order’s defects, defendants are in compliance with it,” the lawyers wrote. “Defendants have taken what they believe to be all necessary steps to comply with the court’s order.”\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nOf course, this is not the only lawfare being conducted against the Trump administration. By the New York Times’s count, more than 40 lawsuits have been filed against the administration in its first three weeks in office. It appears that Democrats, who vainly placed their faith in lawfare to keep Trump out of the White House, are now again placing their faith in lawfare to constrain him in the presidency. Maybe it will work. Maybe it won’t.\n\nEngelmayer scheduled a hearing on the Treasury matter for Friday. Until then, the representatives of political control of the executive branch will be locked out of the payment system at the Treasury Department — the work of a single member of the judicial branch who has decided the president should not have the authority to run one of the most important departments of the U.S. government.","summary":"THE LAWFARE GANG STRIKES AGAIN. Remember New York Attorney General Letitia James?

Judges in New Hampshire, Seattle and Maryland have blocked Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship. New York Attorney General Leitita James advised hospitals to ignore Trump’s executive order ending sex change procedures for minors. Democrats were quick to lash out at Vance on social media on Sunday, equating his comments to \"tyranny\" and \"lawlessness.\" Illinois Gov.

Liz Cheney, the former Republican congresswoman who led the Jan. 6 Select Committee and campaigned for former Vice President Kamala Harris, accused Vance of tyranny. David Hogg, the first Gen Z vice chair of the Democratic Party, said Vance’s comments are a power grab by the executive branch. \"He’s saying this to normalize a power grab by the executive to consolidate the power of the president and make him a king,\" Hogg said. \"If liberals ever said this, conservatives would (rightfully) lose their godd--- minds.\" Connecticut Sen.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the first-term senator whom Trump nicknamed \"Schifty Schiff\" on the campaign trail, said Vance’s comment \"puts us on a dangerous path to lawlessness.\" \"JD, we both went to law school. But we don’t have to be lawyers to know that ignoring court decisions we don’t like puts us on a dangerous path to lawlessness. We just have to swear an oath to the constitution. And mean it,\" Sen. Adam Schiff, D-CA, responded. Some conservatives fired back at the onslaught of comments. Columnist Kurt Schlichter jumped into the conversation, implying Schiff is a bad lawyer. Jed Rubenfeld, a Yale Law School professor, lawyer and constitutional scholar, said he agreed with Vance that judges cannot \"constitutionally interfere.\" \"JD is correct about this, and his examples are exactly right,\" Rubenfeld said. \"Where the Executive has sole and plenary power under the Constitution – as in commanding military operations or exercising prosecutorial discretion – judges cannot constitutionally interfere.\" More X users, who joined the debate, said Vance and his supporters' comments are ironic.

We now have a trifecta in Washington following President Donald Trump's inauguration, with a Republican in the White House and Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress. But this is where the hard work begins—and I'm not just talking about legislating.Republicans will need to defend our House majority almost immediately, which is no small task given the tight margins. We can't rest on our incredible November wins. At least three House seats will be up for special election in the coming months. Democrats are ready to fight on the offense in these first contests after President Trump's election and inauguration.How do I know? I experienced this firsthand as the first member elected to the House after President Trump took office in 2017. My race was a mere 81 days after inauguration. House races must be filled by a direct election in the district per the Constitution—there are no appointments to fill open House seats.In 2017, the so-called \"resistance\" was developing, and Democrats viewed my race as a rebuke of President Trump's victory and the newly established MAGA movement. Democrats were galvanized.However, Republican voters were not as motivated. In fact, Kansas Republicans were frustrated by Washington infighting over the new president's agenda. My internal polling showed a dramatic shift after Republicans pulled the American Health Care Act from the floor. For the Kansans I now represent, it was an outright assault on the will of voters who had just elected a Republican trifecta four and a half months prior.With Republicans feeling deflated and Democrats enthusiastic, turnout played an outsized role. Only about 120,000 voters showed up to the polls on April 11, 2017—28.9 percent turnout—and the race tightened in the final weeks. Less than two years later, against the same opponent, I secured more than 140,000 votes—20,000 more than the entire 2017 turnout. That was despite progressive celebrities Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) pulling into my home state to manufacture opposition to President Trump's agenda and my candidacy.Results can drive turnout, but struggling to come together to pass President Trump's America First agenda will keep many Republicans at home during the upcoming special elections in Florida-01, Florida-06, and New York-21.Like in 2017, Democrats want to tear down the newly inaugurated Trump and his agenda, but​ this time​ they have another reason to flood the New York and Florida airwaves—the House majority. When all three of these seats are vacated, the balance of power will be 217 Republicans to 215 Democrats.Republicans must work to hold all three seats and not simply rely on their \"safe R\" label.We saw the effect of Democrats targeting the House majority in the 2024 election. Consider this: Flipping the Senate was long considered a guarantee in the last election. Democrats privately acknowledged that the odds of keeping the Senate majority were slim after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) announced his retirement, and many battleground states looked like they were leaning Republican.Then came the June 27, 2024, presidential debate. A feeble and incoherent President Joe Biden exposed the real possibility that the presidency would tip to Donald Trump. Democratic donors were spooked, and money flowed to the only spot left—competitive House races. Even after Vice President Kamala Harris took over the top of the Democratic ticket, donors were focused on the House.On Election Day—and in the days after as final ballots were counted—Republicans had flipped eight seats, but Democrats had flipped nine. In a year when President Trump won the popular vote and Republicans flipped four states in the Senate, Democrats tightened the House majority by a single seat thanks to deep pockets and a last-ditch effort to prevent a Republican trifecta.Once again, Democratic donors and the left-wing media have no place to peddle their influence except in these upcoming special elections. Grassroots organizers and candidates must be ready to defend these three seats with contributions, volunteer efforts, and prayers; current members must show a unified resolve to implement the policies promised that swept us into the majority in the House, Senate, and White House.Democrats will be motivated to flip the House majority months into the new Congress. Republican lawmakers must motivate voters by unifying behind the president's plan to lower prices, secure our border, reduce taxes, and tighten federal spending. That's what created success at the ballot box in November, and delivering those results will lead to successes in Florida and New York this year.Ron Estes, one of only a handful of engineers in Congress, worked in the aerospace, energy and manufacturing sectors before representing Kansas' Fourth Congressional District since 2017.

Why? Because it represents a return to normal: a clear statement that rejects the leftist belief that there is no biological difference between men and women, that we should celebrate men dominating women in the field of athletics, and that this Orwellian madness is actually unquestionable proof that our society is modern, liberal and compassionate. After all, there is apparently nothing more compassionate than forcing girls to change in locker rooms with naked adult men.\n\nOf course, we must be able to define what is normal. This might help: 79% of those polled by a recent New York Times-Ipsos survey said biological men who “identify as women” should not be allowed to compete in women’s sports. Let alone the fact that 67% of Democrats polled also rejected the idea that men should be allowed to compete in women’s sports.\n\nMake no mistake: The vast majority of people do not support men in women’s sports. So let the activists on the fringe descend ever deeper into the extremes of their own dying movement, elevating progressive wunderkind David Hogg, complaining that former Vice President Kamala Harris lost the election because of racism and sexism, and condemning Trump as being pro-transgender child suicide.\n\nLet them shout and scream and cry until they’re blue in the face. That won’t stop them being left behind by the rest of the country who have decided: enough.\n\nIan Haworth is a columnist, speaker, and podcast host.

The tech company is instead set to adopt a “community notes” model reminiscent of what is used by Elon Musk’s X, which relies on users instead of experts to flag misinformation.\n\nWhen asked about Zuckerberg’s recent pivot, Hoffman said, “LinkedIn more reflects my point of view on these things.” The career-focused social networking site, acquired by Microsoft (MSFT) in 2016, maintains a policy banning false and misleading content.\n\nRegardless of “however you get to the equivalent of fact-checking,” it’s important to continuously innovate in that direction, said Hoffman. “I think having civil dialogue, and a space for that, is incredibly important,” he added.\n\nReid Hoffman’s Silicon Valley ties\n\nHoffman, who currently has an estimated net worth of $2.6 billion, is deeply interconnected to the tech industry. An early PayPal (PYPL) executive and member of the original “PayPal Mafia,” Hoffman has been a board member at companies like Microsoft, AirBnb (ABNB) and OpenAI, in which he was an early investor.\n\nHoffman has backed dozens of other A.I. startups through the venture capital firm Greylock Partners. In 2022, he co-founded Inflection AI, a company known for its chatbot Pi. Earlier this year, he launched Manas AI, a startup focusing on drug discovery.\n\nWhile his Silicon Valley peers have largely cozied up to the Trump administration, Hoffman, a prominent supporter of Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign, has been more reluctant to embrace the new government. That said, he lauded the President’s efforts to support A.I., notably the Stargate project, a $500 billion joint venture among OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle. “It is extremely important for all governments to be in dialogue with the tech industry,” Hoffman said.\n\nCollaborations of such scale is necessary given the potential impact of A.I. advancement, which Hoffman called the “cognitive industrial revolution.” In addition to major productivity increases, A.I.’s challenges will include overseeing a societal transition to the new technology, he added.\n\nUnlike some tech leaders, however, Hoffman isn’t advocating for a halt in A.I. development but instead believes the right regulation will form as the technology progresses. “Some people say: pause, stop until we can figure out all these possible invisible harms,” said Hoffman. “There are millions and millions of possible negatives, and you don’t get the future you want by just trying to wipe out all the negative ones.”","summary":"Reid Hoffman cautions against the tech industry's shifting stance on free speech.","url":"https://observer.com/2025/02/linkedin-reid-hoffman-big-tech-fact-checking-rollback/","image":"https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/GettyImages-2196491969.jpg?quality=80","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-10 20:55:13","author":"Alexandra Tremayne-Pengelly","authors":["Alexandra Tremayne-Pengelly"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":289102136,"title":"Life, Liberty, and the Right To Shitpost","text":"Expression has never been more convenient. Censorship has never been easier. \n\nFrom research papers on arXiv to mukbang videos on YouTube, digital content is easily accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Meanwhile, authoritarian regimes, enterprising bureaucrats, and the self-appointed speech police work to hide heretical ideas and shape information flows.\n\nExpressive freedom is foundational to America. Our forefathers were experts at writing scandalous articles, drawing salacious cartoons, and distributing satirical pamphlets. Some of this was done with their real names, but many preferred anonymity. Thomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, and Alexander Hamilton were some of the original anonymous shitposters. \n\nPeople always bemoan advances in technology, usually claiming that each new medium creates problems requiring the state to step in and protect incumbents. Generative AI is such a technological advance, and many are working to tame its expressive potential. Limiting AI would mean accepting a more sanitized and controlled world, as well as capitulating on America's value of expressive freedom. \n\nEfforts to homogenize or hinder generative AI's development or to constrain it must be opposed. Americans must defend their right to shitpost. \n\nGenerative AI's Promise and Peril\n\nGenerative AI is a force multiplier for creative expression. Just as earlier technologies such as the printing press lowered barriers to creative endeavors, today's newest expressive tools are cutting the time it takes to illustrate a book or mix a new beat. This follows the trajectory of other software advances such as word processing and grammar checks, video editing, and Photoshop: functional improvements that lower barriers to creating and sharing novel content. \n\nGenerative models represent a step up from these earlier developments, as they are easy to use, enable skill enhancement, and have the potential for long-term benefits. These tools save time, personalize output, and support expression.\n\nDespite its benefits, AI will inevitably be misused. In 2024, deepfaked nude images of Taylor Swift spread like wildfire on social media—an appalling violation that many people experience. We cannot sweep these harms under the rug but we also cannot allow misuse to overshadow enormous potential. Handling the abuses of AI should be focused on mitigating harmful acts rather than imposing controls on speech-promoting technologies.\n\nNo, It Can't Do That!\n\nPolling done by the AI-focused nonprofit Fathom found that the proliferation of AI-generated deepfakes and misinformation are among Americans' greatest concerns about AI. These concerns give legislators an opportunity to lock down these tools in pursuit of fairness and safety. But the most visible threat to the right to shitpost comes not from proposed laws but from lawsuits brought by incumbent industries over the presence of copyrighted materials in datasets used by AI developers. Lawsuits from creatives and corporations could threaten AI model development if courts are receptive to their arguments.\n\nA compulsory licensing regime that many rights holders seek would disadvantage U.S. developers and grant the rights holders total control over model training. Considering copyright maximalists' history of bringing lawsuits that stymie speech, this deluge of litigation could, at best, create a system where AI developers would have to pay enormous royalties to rights holders. At its worst, such a push could enable media and creative incumbents to dictate training and even downstream uses of AI, which would inhibit the general public's freedom of expression.\n\nBills that allow people to sue someone for invoking their identity are having a moment. These \"right of publicity\" laws introduce legal liability for using an individual's name, image, or likeness without their permission. While traditionally limited to commercial use of someone's likeness, legislation has been proposed at the federal level and enacted in some states that would make it much easier for people to sue for any unauthorized use of their likeness. This could create another avenue for chilling speech, particularly for critical forms of expression. Imagine needing President Donald Trump or former Vice President Kamala Harris' permission before generating a satirical cartoon of them.\n\nConcerns about deepfakes should be taken seriously, but legislation should focus on tangible harms or acts of illegality. One of the most problematic uses of generative AI is to create synthetic child pornography. Legislation such as the SHIELD Act would make the creation and distribution of this content illegal, extending existing law covering sexual exploitation of real children. A similar approach could be taken for using generative content for other harmful activities such as fraud. In most instances, we should be seeking to clarify the law and provide recourse for those who are tangibly harmed, but not unduly saddle AI developers and users with liability.\n\nThe most diffuse threat to generative AI's support of speech comes from rules and regulations attacking \"algorithmic bias\" and extending liability to developers for users' behavior. Legislators at the state and federal levels have proposed laws that would require pre-deployment testing and post-deployment monitoring to ensure AI models are not contributing to discrimination. Similar language permeated the Biden administration's Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, which called for model developers to conduct \"equity assessments\" as well as proactively prevent models from creating harm that is \"unintended, but foreseeable.\" \n\nIntent matters. As with concerns about the right to publicity, addressing concerns around discrimination should be grounded in existing law related to identifying discriminatory intent. If a model is designed to intentionally discriminate against a certain protected class, then it would already violate existing civil rights laws. \n\nPutting guardrails on how models can respond to queries related to controversial topics—whether through hard law (government legislation or regulation) or soft law (nonbinding codes of conduct or commitments induced by nongovernment organizations)—embraces a paternalism that is unlikely to produce better outcomes. Transparency in how models are built, including around training data and architectural choices, would be a more honest and potentially powerful commitment to fairness. \n\nThe Right To Shitpost Is the Right to Think\n\nAmerica's tradition of free speech stems from a rejection of Old World censorship as the Founders sought to build a society where dissent, debate, and diverse viewpoints could thrive. The right to mock, parody, satirize, and poke fun at those in power—the right to shitpost—is foundational to the American ethos. \n\nCurrently, the creative and expressive potential of AI is less restrained by some vague principles encoded by developers; the bigger constraint is the person sitting at a keyboard. The utility one can derive from an AI system is dependent on the user's knowledge, creativity, and use of prompting techniques. \n\nThe iterative improvement of models requires people to use them in ways that may not have been previously envisioned by their developers, which should be celebrated rather than denigrated. There will be downsides. However, rigid laws and top-down controls that impact model capability will necessarily limit the expressive benefits of generative AI. Evolution based on market signals that are informed by user preferences will create a product that is more in line with people's interests. Cutting off the ability for an AI to learn just because it could support heretical speech or ideas goes against the spirit of the First Amendment and allows a select few to hold a veto over technology and, by extension, free expression. \n\nIn a recent essay, First Amendment scholar Eugene Volokh examined the shift between early software development and today's world of algorithms. In the earlier period, developers built products that put users in control, such as word processors and browsers. But today's platform and app developers impose a top-down experience rife with opportunities for jawboning and censorship. He proposes a return to the era of \"user sovereignty,\" where we can use digital tools freely, as opposed to our current environment, where digital tools are controlled by others.\n\nThe ability to harness language, images, and music in ways that were out of reach for many has the potential to unlock a new era of content production and consumption. Empowering people to leverage generative AI to discover new skills and share their creations is an exciting opportunity to advance humanity's pursuit of knowledge and creativity—two virtues integral to a living and thriving public. Defending people's ability to build and use such technology unencumbered is a path worth following. We must defend the right to shitpost.","summary":"Generative AI is a powerful tool for creativity and speech.

The exact percentage is negotiated between the NIH and each institution.This means that if an institution had a 50 percent rate in 2024, it would receive $150,000 for a $100,000 grant, with $50,000 in indirect costs. After the new directive, that would drop to $115,000.Maine, where Collins is from, is among the states that could be most affected by the cap.

Trump has emphasized cutting federal spending since returning to the White House last month.But the announcement quickly drew pushback from researchers, who warned the cuts would result in fewer funds for medical researchers.Collins' criticism comes as she faces a potentially difficult reelection in Maine, a state that backed Vice President Kamala Harris by about 7 points in 2024.

I looked up Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’s five stages of grief. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. I moved on from denial to anger to bargaining. What could I have done to prevent this from happening?”\n\nMeanwhile, at the Democratic National Committee meeting on Feb. 1, strategists picked through the pieces and came up with the formula that had led them to losing the White House and both houses of Congress: wokeness, economic madness and the illusion that they lacked clear messaging. We need more of this, not less, they concluded.\n\nTo which I say, mug them again. One woman was dragged out by security after screaming, “I am terrified!” Others yelled “climate emergency!” and “fossil fuel money!”\n\n“The Democratic brand is in the toilet,” wrote Molly Ball in the Wall Street Journal, noting that a Journal poll found that “60 percent of Americans view the party unfavorably while only 36 percent see it favorably.

She called the administration’s ban on males in girls’ and women’s sports a “cavernous cruelty, and the distinct smell of autocratic sauerbraten.”\n\nThat’s code for comparing Mr. Trump to Hitler. Other leftist pundits gave Mr. Musk the same treatment for his outstretched arm in a photo, although that nasty little slander has been eclipsed by pictures on social media of several Democrats in the same pose.\n\nDuring the 1980s, comedian Mort Sahl spoofed liberal media bias with a fake headline: “World Ends Tomorrow: Women and Minorities Hardest Hit.”\n\nNot to be outdone, The Washington Post this past Wednesday raged on its front page over the president’s executive order halting spending by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID):\n\n“Fear, pain, hunger for millions as aid dries up.”\n\nAccording to the White House’s Feb. 3 order, the USAID has spent billions on weird stuff overseas, including $2 million to Guatemala for sex changes and LGBTQ activism; $4.67 million to EcoHealth Alliance, which funded bat virus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China; and $10 million for meals to the Nusra Front, an al Qaida-linked terrorist group.\n\nThe agency’s leftist staff also has interfered in foreign countries against U.S. policies. There’s a name for that.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who was appointed acting director of USAID, says the agency will be analyzed and that anything worth funding, such as real humanitarian aid, will continue. However, it might be under the State Department so they can keep an eye on things.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter on Feb. 3 to the acting directors of the Justice Department and the FBI calling the ouster of some ideologues an “alarming threat to national security.”\n\nNo, it isn’t. It’s only a threat to a politicized, partisan operation that needs a thorough detox.\n\nAny Democrats who can’t handle all this change might want to read Sally Quinn’s aforementioned tale of reaching peace through methods taught by a Harvard psychiatrist who doubles as a Buddhist guru.\n\nHe, too, woke up and had feelings of “rage, fear and disgust” upon learning the election outcome. But he put his Zen meditation in gear and got through it, she says.\n\nAs for her, she went from acceptance back to denial upon learning that former Fox host Kimberly Guilfoyle had been appointed “ambassador to my beloved Greece, where I spent the happiest years of my childhood. I had a total relapse.”\n\nMaybe it’s a good time to try something else: “No Jesus, no peace; know Jesus, know peace.”\n\nThis column was first published at the Washington Times.","summary":"'The GOP had better not get complacent.

It may sound prosaic, but it couldn’t be more important.\n\nAs marriage goes, so goes the nation.\n\nWithout marriage, we become a nation of increasingly isolated, self-absorbed individuals, which is why the decline of marriage is so ominous.\n\nIn 1970, married couples were 71% of U.S. households. By 2022, they were 47%. In 1962, 90% of 30-year-olds were married. By 2019, that figure had fallen to 51%.\n\nOne in four 40-year-olds has never been married. According to the Pew Research Center, 40% of unmarried adults think marriage is obsolete.\n\nIn a recent survey, only 30% of millennials said having a successful marriage was one of the most important things in life. The rest prioritize saving the smelt and choosing the right pet food.\n\nEven a casual look at data makes the case for marriage. Married couples are happier and healthier, live longer and are more successful. They’re also more likely to be involved in the community.\n\nChildren raised in households with both of their biological parents do better on every index. They’re more likely to do well in school and avoid drugs, alcohol and crime.\n\nPrisons, mental hospitals and homeless shelters are testaments to the consequences of a failure to form families.\n\nThe most dangerous force in society is unattached males in their teens and 20s. A 2016 report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found 59% of inmates in state prisons had never been married.\n\nRaquel Welch, a 1970s sex symbol, decried the flight from marriage. In a 2010 commentary, Welch confessed: “I’m ashamed to admit that I myself have been married four times, and yet I feel that marriage is the cornerstone of civilization, an essential institution that stabilizes society, provides a sanctuary for children and saves us from anarchy.”\n\nAs the marriage rate has fallen, so has the birth rate.\n\nAmong those in their prime childbearing years (ages 18 to 35), 65% were married in 1960 versus 51% today. As a result, the fertility rate – the number of children the average woman will have in her lifetime – has plummeted from 3.55 in 1960 to 1.78 today, well below the replacement level of 2.1.\n\nSome of the most powerful forces in our society have united to create an anti-marriage culture. Once, marriage was a marker of adulthood. You grew up, got married and had children. No longer.\n\nToday, two-thirds of young adults say they feel no pressure from their families to marry. Most parents no longer object to conduct that would have produced a shotgun in generations past.\n\nThe entertainment media provide a relentlessly negative view of marriage. Stories about the limitations of marriage and joys of singleness are everywhere. It’s as if infidelity, exploitation and abuse were the norms of married life.\n\nRarely do we get stories of lonely singles in their middle years regretting their earlier choices. “All the lonely people, where do they all come from?”\n\nChildren are portrayed as a nuisance and a financial burden rather than a natural part of living.\n\nReliable contraception and the availability of opportunities to “hook up” have lessened the incentive to marry. Politicians who will spend billions on green energy and a transgender opera in Colombia see no benefit in promoting marriage.\n\nOn the left, there’s a fear of slighting marriage alternatives, such as cohabitation. On the right, there’s the libertarian notion of laissez-faire.\n\nThe Democratic Party’s most reliable constituency is single women. In 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris carried the vote of unmarried women by more than 20 percentage points.\n\n“You don’t need a husband,” Democrats seem to say to young women. “A man will interfere with your career and tie you down. Think of us as your daddy. You want abortion on demand? We’ll see that you get it.”\n\nDo politicians ever consider the effect on the tax base with marriage and fertility falling fast? Older workers aren’t being replaced at a fast enough pace to shoulder the burden of government.\n\nOnce, marriage was less about romantic love than social responsibility and finding a life partner. People married for stability, security and companionship. The passion of youth matured into the love that lasts a lifetime.\n\nWe need to rediscover the type of marriage that produces the sense of wonder and joy that comes from being connected to the past and future – of being part of the fabric of society woven over generations.\n\nThis column was first published at the Washington Times.","summary":"Rarely does Hollywood give us stories of lonely singles in their middle years","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/02/marriage-decline-threatens-our-social-economic-future/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wedding-couple-love-romance-happy-smiling-teeth-bride-groom-marriage-veil-pixabay.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-10 19:58:02","author":"Don Feder","authors":["Don Feder"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.008},{"id":289095408,"title":"Springfield, Ohio, sues neo-Nazi group over hate campaign against Haitians","text":"The City of Springfield, Ohio, has filed a civil lawsuit against a neo-Nazi group, which it alleges tormented the community following false accusations that Haitian migrants living in the Ohio town were “eating pets” of U.S. citizens.\n\nSpringfield Mayor Rob Rue and several others sued the Blood Tribe, leaders Christopher Pohlhaus and Drake Berentz and seven unnamed followers in U.S. District Court in Dayton.\n\n“The Blood Tribe and its members and associates unleashed a torrent of hateful conduct, including acts of harassment, bomb threats, and death threats, against Springfield residents who spoke out in support of the Haitian community,” the complaint says.\n\nThey also accuse the four-year-old neo-Nazi group of, “engaging in, and inciting, a campaign of harassment and intimidation, motivated by ethnic and racial hatred, against those who supported Springfield’s Haitian community in the face of Defendants’ racist attacks.”\n\nWith legal help from the Anti-Defamation League, the plaintiffs are asking the court for a jury trial seeking to block the group from making further threats and to impose damages.\n\nSpringfield, a city of roughly 60,000 west of Columbus, has seen its Haitian population grow to about 10,000 to 20,000 people in recent years, as Haitians have fled violence in their home country in search of stability and employment.\n\nTheir growing numbers caused friction with local residents, as schools, roads, hospitals and social programs were taxed by the large population — and, particularly, after a child was killed in 2023 when a Haitian immigrant driver hit a school bus.\n\nIn early September, a woman in Springfield wrote a post on social media falsely claiming that the Haitians in Springfield were butchering cats. The post went viral and U.S. President Donald Trump repeated them during a September presidential debate with Kamala Harris, when he made false claims that Springfield Haitians were abducting and eating people’s cats and dogs.\n\n“In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. The people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating — they’re eating the pets of the people that live there,” Trump said.\n\nThe lawsuit makes no direct reference to Trump’s remarks, but notes that Pohlhaus “gleefully took credit for the growing notoriety” the false claims gained as they spread around the world after the debate.\n\nThe lawsuit says that around the time of the false claims, there were at least 33 bomb threats made by phone or email against hospitals, schools, private residences and different businesses all over Springfield, causing many evacuations. Many of those threats are attributed to “members and associates” of Blood Tribe, according to the suit.\n\nSpringfield’s lawsuit against the Blood Tribe alleges that the group first coordinated a “hit” against the city before that, in July, casting the influx of Haitians as an “invasion” that was threatening Springfield’s “good White residents of the city.”\n\nThe Blood Tribe showed up at the city’s jazz and blues festival in August, according to court documents, displaying guns, waving swastika flags and wearing matching red shirts, black pants and ski masks. They made their way to City Hall, where Berentz went on to deliver a “racist and antisemitic rant,” to which followers responded with chants of “Seig Heil” and Nazi salutes.\n\nAdditional actions the lawsuit alleges against the group include harassing voicemails, hateful emails and social media posts demeaning the plaintiffs and their families. The complaint says that group members also used dating apps to send men looking for drugs and sex to the residents’ homes late at night and publicized their personal information with the intent of getting others to join in the harassment.\n\nThe plaintiffs are seeking punitive damages and compensation for the thousands of dollars spent on extra security as the Blood Tribe’s campaign unfolded around the city.\n\n— With files from The Associated Press","summary":"The lawsuit accuses the Blood Tribe of 'hateful conduct, including acts of harassment, bomb threats, and death threats' against Springfield residents.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11012038/springfield-ohio-haitians-lawsuit-neo-nazis/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/71b478b499f96ea87583c1d24a3fb93efaa8c8153d341bfba47a1fa023ece40f.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-10 19:53:37","author":"Katie Scott","authors":["Katie Scott"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.127},{"id":289085338,"title":"Map Shows Red States Losing the Most Funding From NIH Cuts","text":"Republican states could lose billions of dollars in medical research funding after the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced new funding cuts amid President Donald Trump's attempts to curb federal spending.Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment via email.Why It MattersWhen a researcher receives a research grant, their institution will also receive additional funds known as \"indirect costs\" that go toward infrastructure such as utilities, maintenance or administrative costs, lessening the burden on these institutions. The exact percentage is negotiated between NIH and each institution.NIH announced Friday it would implement a 15 percent limit on \"indirect costs\" on grants for research, highlighting that some institutions like Harvard University or Yale University currently enjoy rates upwards of 60 to 70 percent. In 2024, NIH spent more than $9 billion on these indirect costs, according to the Blue Ridge Institute for Medical Research, which compiles data on all NIH grants.These costs will now be taken on by research institutes, which say the cuts will have grim ramifications for medical research across the country.While the NIH highlighted institutions in blue states Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maryland that benefit from the indirect funds, Republican states also benefit from the indirect funding and stand to lose billions from these cuts.What to KnowThe NIH wrote the lower indirect cost rates will \"save more than $4B a year effective immediately,\" noting that rate is \"above what many major foundations allow and much lower than the 60%+ that some institutions charge the government today.\"But the change has sparked concerns from researchers across the country who believe it will result in cuts to research for cancer and other diseases such as Alzheimer's or diabetes.Funding generally reflects the population of a state, not its political leaning, so the two states that received the most indirect funding and would stand to lose the most are big blue states California and New York. Texas, the third largest state and largest red state, received nearly $505 million in indirect costs.North Carolina and Pennsylvania, battlegrounds that backed Trump, received $394 million and $601 million in indirect funding in 2024, according to Blue Ridge Institute.This map shows how much each state would have lost in 2024 indirect funding had the 15 percent rule been in place last year.When it came to which states received the highest indirect cost rate, there was no clear partisan distinction. Of the 10 states with the highest rate, five voted for Trump—Iowa, Kentucky, Nebraska, Ohio and South Dakota—while five voted for Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024—Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey and New York.Senator Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican, is among those raising concerns about the impact this move will have.\"While the administration works to achieve this goal at NIH, a smart, targeted approach is needed in order to not hinder life-saving, groundbreaking research at high-achieving institutions like those in Alabama,\" she told AL.com.Alabama, home to recipients such as the University of Alabama, received nearly $90 million in indirect costs in 2024, according to the Blue Ridge Institute.What People Are SayingAssociation of Public & Land Grant Universities President Mark Becker in a statement: \"NIH slashing the reimbursement of research costs will slow and limit medical breakthroughs that cure cancer and address chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.

Medical innovation will be slowed, delaying the creation of new treatments, new technologies, and new health workers.\"What Happens NextThe decision is already facing a legal challenge from 22 attorneys general seeking to block the change in how indirect costs are dispersed.

No, he remains as tacky and ostentatious as a gold-plated toilet brush. \n\nInstead, the shift has more to do with the Democrats becoming decidedly uncool and Trump benefitting, by way of comparison. By morphing into everything it once stood against and adopting a succession of repellent trends, the cultural Left, and by extension, the Democratic Party, has shed every ounce of cool it earned since Allen Ginsburg rapped to the beat of a bongo. \n\nAnd as always, Trump is the primary beneficiary of Democrats’ ill-consideration. \n\nCounterculture goes mainstream\n\nIronically, the Left’s claim to “cool” has been undermined by its own overwhelming success in the culture war. \n\nBy the end of former President Barack Obama’s second term, cultural progressivism had come to dominate every nonreligious institution in the nation (and some religious ones, too). Its key tenets — relativism, sexual liberation, and anti-Americanism, to name a few — were expounded upon in academia, perpetuated through the news media, celebrated on the silver screen, and enforced by Democrats and “moderate” Republicans on Capitol Hill. In the late 2010s, it was impossible to evade a highly specific form of cultural conditioning, which came to be known as “wokeism.”\n\nHowever, this success robbed the movement of a characteristic central to its identity and was responsible for its appeal since the 1960s: its claim to being the “rebels.”\n\nIn recent years, the contradiction has become impossible to conceal. No matter how it tried to simultaneously be both the authority and the insurgent, the illusion that the Left was “punching up” against a dominant traditional culture became progressively more ridiculous. \n\nWhen the acclaimed singer Sam Smith strutted the Grammys stage in 2022 in a red dress and a dog collar while performing a satanic ritual on live TV, America was neither “shocked” nor challenged to rethink its values — it simply groaned.\n\nWhen a mulleted and vaguely unshowered-looking Kristen Stewart, previously of Twilight fame, posed for a risque Rolling Stone photoshoot wearing garb meant to evoke lesbianism — a softball jersey, high athletic socks with racer stripes, “granny” underwear, etc. — America suppressed laughter the way one does at a teenager who emerges from their bedroom with a hoop through their septum. \n\n“I want to do the gayest f***ing thing you’ve ever seen in your life,” Stewart said in the interview, driving home her desire to fit in with the times. “If I could grow a little mustache, if I could grow a f***ing happy trail and unbutton my pants, I would.” \n\nEnforced compliance\n\nWhen massive and all-powerful DEI bureaucracies were erected on campuses and in boardrooms to enforce the universal adoption of its ideology and corresponding verbiage, any remaining doubt about who was really in charge of our culture vanished. \n\nThe progressive Left, heirs of the 60s counterculture, became the mainstream. The rebels became the authority. It is definitionally impossible to be both dominant and “edgy,” to be “in charge” and be “cool.”\n\nAnd once it captured near-total cultural power, it enforced its moral vision with merciless glee.\n\nFor a century, dystopian authors imagined vast techno-bureaucratic regimes enforcing conformity through centralized power. However, cultural progressivism became so powerful that the masses were conditioned to enforce the new morality on their own.\n\nThrough a phenomenon known as “cancel culture,” in which frothing mobs hunted down heretics and burnt them at the reputational stake, the new authority made sure careers were lost and friendships were severed, that everyone understood the price of nonconformity. Accepting the counterculture or suffering the consequences seemed to be the message.\n\nNot even such powerful compliance mechanisms could conceal such an inherent contradiction.\n\nRole reversal\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, this role reversal stood in stark relief, and perhaps most surprisingly of all, the Democratic Party chose to emphasize this shift in explicit terms. \n\nBy framing the race between former Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump as being between an outlaw and a prosecutor, the Democrats ditched their claim to “cool” and offered the role of the “rebel” to Trump on a silver platter. \n\nBeyond the incoherence of going from “defund the police” to “vote for the prosecutor” in a matter of three years, this strategy exposed a stunning ignorance of the cultural forces that inform our politics. The attempt to cast Trump as an outlaw, which began with a transparently coordinated effort by the Justice Department to convict him of a felony, any felony, so it could say the words “Donald Trump, convicted felon” as often as possible, only enhanced his appeal. The nation saw him less as a mob boss finally facing justice than as a flawed but ultimately innocent man being hounded by a crooked sheriff. \n\nThe strategy stunk of cultural disconnect and decay. Even if the Democratic Party had succeeded in casting Trump as a criminal and itself as “the man,” the outcome may have very well been the same. The outlaw is an American archetype, after all — and one of the “coolest.” Millions upon millions of rap albums have been purchased on this very premise. America has long rooted for the “bad guy” in movies. \n\nThere are numerous reasons for this. America had long been enamored of the anti-hero, from Jesse James to Tony Soprano. People are skeptical of authority and have been since the Boston Tea Party. Americans are ironic and humorous people who enjoy flipping the bird at conventionality. That, in fact, might be the act at the very heart of “cool.” \n\nAuthenticity gap\n\nHowever, above all, Americans value authenticity and detest artifice, and the matchup between Trump and Harris could not have offered a clearer contrast in this regard. \n\nWhatever one thinks of Trump’s character — and indeed, books could not contain all there is to say on the topic — one cannot accuse him of artificiality. He is authentic to a fault. We always know what he’s thinking because he never stops expressing himself. All of his faults are revealed in this way, but also all of his merits. \n\nIf being “cool” means being yourself, then Trump is the modern-day Miles Davis. He is manifestly incapable of being anything else. \n\nHarris, on the other hand, campaigned behind an impenetrable shield of canned slogans such as, “I grew up in the middle class … I believe in the dreams, ambitions, and aspirations of the American people … ” She changed her accent depending on the audience, a behavior known as “code-switching.” Her campaign had to reshoot visits to the gas station with her running mate multiple times to make it seem genuine.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER \n\nIt would have been impossible to stage a less “cool” campaign. \n\nIn the long term, the staggering losses of 2024 will do the Democrats good. Being banished to the cultural wilderness will help them to rediscover their edge and their authenticity. However, they’ve earned their place among the lame for now. (One can hear, even now, the shrill echo of a woke scold remonstrating my use of the word “lame”).","summary":"Many are now positing what was recently unthinkable: President Donald Trump, the beta-carotene-hued king of all things camp, is suddenly “cool.” “Trump is cool now,” an incredulous Bill Maher remarked on a recent episode of HBO’s Real Time. “I mean, rappers like him, the athletes. &#8230; I mean, the Village People are gay for Trump [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3315308/how-left-lost-its-cool/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Kamala-Harris-Oprah.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-10 19:00:00","author":"Peter Laffin","authors":["Peter Laffin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.121},{"id":289079602,"title":"It's not only the Super Bowl fans who booed at Taylor Swift; Elon Musk also took a sharp dig at her; here's what he said","text":"Taylor Swift had to bear the brunt of getting booed by Super Bowl fans at the New Orleans stadium where the Kansas City Chiefs were playing the Eagles.

The president’s job approval rating is in positive territory. Most American adults think he’s delivering on the promises he made during the 2024 campaign. Respondents describe both Trump and his set piece policy preferences in positive terms.\n\nThere are also warning signs in this survey. Elon Musk is fast becoming a political liability for this administration. In addition, two-thirds of respondents say Trump isn’t devoting enough attention to his pledge to lower consumer prices, and the tariffs on places like Mexico, Canada, and Europe that the president has floated are deeply unpopular. Overall, however, the poll suggests that the ingredients for a sustainable pro-Trump political coalition are available to the president and his movement.\n\nTo survey the demographic breakdown of Trump’s job approval rating as measured by CBS/YouGov pollsters is to take some small measure of Democrats’ sense of betrayal. With just 47 percent of women disapproving of Trump’s performance while 60 percent of men approve, the gender gap now decisively favors the GOP. Fully one-third of black respondents expressed support for Trump. While a staggering two-thirds of white adults without a degree support Trump, white degree holders — maybe the Democratic Party’s most pandered-to demographic — are split down the middle. But what must sting the most for Democrats is the perfidy of the young voter. Among respondents under 30, 55 percent approve of Trump’s conduct in office.\n\nOf all the disorienting revelations voters imposed on Democrats last November, young voters’ departure from their ranks may be the most bewildering. For a party that has committed itself to the cult of youth for over half a century, few political outcomes could be as psychologically devastating as this.\n\nConsider how Democratic activists flattered younger voters in the wake of the 2022 midterm elections, as The Atlantic’s Kaitlyn Tiffany chronicled. Generation Z was fêted in the most obsequiously laudatory terms. They were “saving us from the world we’ve given them,” meeting the expectation that they would “make the world a better place.” As Tiffany observed, the highly conceptualized idea of this generation, who were regarded by their elders as a political instrument to be wielded, amounted to condescension. More than that, it was also a self-serving fantasy.\n\nIn the election that produced all these encomia for Gen Z, young voters “often displayed lower turnout rates than in the 2018 midterms,” Brookings Institution analysts observed. “This is opposite of what happened between the 2014 and 2018 midterms as well as between the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, when the younger group registered the largest turnout gains of all age groups.” After the party’s electoral debacle in 2024, the scales fell from Democratic eyes.\n\nYounger voters, it turned out, were more ambivalent about the Democratic Party than they had been in previous cycles — a condition that was not new in 2024 but had been ignored. The Gen Z influencer set seems wildly out of touch with the generation for whom they are presumed to speak, some admitted only after it had become culturally safe to do so. Indeed, many of the activist organizations on which Democrats leaned to drive turnout did not share the party’s ideological objectives or policy preferences. Again, the fact that Democratic elected officials haven’t had a pleasant interaction with the young activist set in years might have been a clue.\n\nIt isn’t fair to say that no one on the left saw the Democratic Party’s struggles with young voters coming. But those Cassandras did not receive their due, perhaps because the Democratic self-conception is as the party of youth.\n\nThe modern Democratic origin myth is rooted in the campus activism of the late 1960s and early ’70s. Theirs is the party of MTV’s “Rock the Vote” campaigns, which evolved into the more menacing “vote or die” campaign. The Democrats are the party of TikTok dances, teenage stridency and moral blackmail, and interminable efforts to pander to young people’s imagined wants (like lowering the voting age or foisting their student debt burdens onto everyone else). This is the party of Barack Obama, who “forged a much different relationship with young voters” and built the machinery necessary to maintain that relationship through the generations. They fawned over him and he flattered them right back. (This is “the most incredible group of Americans we have ever, ever, ever produced,” he would tell college audiences that hadn’t yet achieved anything.)\n\nAll this mutual admiration was superficial. In fact, the Obama effect among young voters was short-lived. After 2008, young adults never exhibited the enthusiasm for Obama’s program they reserved for him personally. Hillary Clinton counted on young voters to save her candidacy, and they did not. Bernie Sanders banked on the same delusion. Kamala Harris had no right to the belief that she could reignite the Obama coalition, but that seemed to be her campaign’s theory of the case.\n\nThese campaigns’ appeals to young voters were predicated on narrower and narrower conceptions of who their young voters were. Democrats could convince themselves that they still owned the young adult bloc only because they defined it in ways that excluded ever increasing numbers of young voters. And now, the idealized young voter they invented in their own heads has betrayed them.\n\nDemocrats will confront the temptation to retreat into the self-serving misapprehensions they projected onto young adults in the first place. The party out of power will tell itself that it needs to be more obsessive about climate change and abortion rights, more hostile toward Israel, more embittered by and cynical toward the American social compact. But none of these issues explain Trump’s support among young voters. And as Democrats spend more time stewing over their unenviable condition, they may just conclude that the young people deserve to suffer for their faithlessness.\n\n“The youth will not save us,” Slate’s Luke Winkie opined ruefully in the last election’s wake. He chronicled the outpouring of Democratic frustrations with “the worst generation of all time,” a spastic and ditzy contingent that never “learned to see through disinformation,” and who had consigned their elders “to hell for the rest of our lives.”\n\nThat’s the spirit! Indeed, acrimony of this sort is what Democrats typically reserve for the apostate members of erstwhile Democratic constituencies. How else can Democrats navigate the world in the absence of their cultish affinity for the notion that the youth have some special claim on political virtue? It can’t be that the party’s cherished preconceptions about the noble young American monolith was flawed. No, it will be the children who are wrong.","summary":"Of all the disorienting revelations voters imposed on Democrats, young voters’ departure from their ranks may be the most bewildering.","url":"https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/02/democrats-stung-by-the-cult-of-youth-again/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/maga-supporters.jpg?fit=2057%2C1200&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-10 18:36:37","author":"Noah Rothman","authors":["Noah Rothman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":289068060,"title":"Reid Hoffman doesn't want Big Tech's pivot from fact-checking to mean more misinformation","text":"As tech companies like Meta move away from fact-checking, LinkedIn's cofounder Reid Hoffman doesn't want it to come at the expense of more misinformation.

This happened following her boyfriend Travis Kelce’s team, the Kansas City Chiefs, losing to the Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans to miss out on a three-peat at the prestigious event. President Donald Trump left the event early. Later, he turned to his preferred social media platform, Truth Social, and posted while en route back to Florida aboard what was likely Air Force One. “The only one who had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!” he wrote.\n\nAs reports revealed, Trump was the first sitting US president to attend the Super Bowl. Previously, Al Gore attended the Georgia Dome in Atlanta in 1994 to watch the Dallas Cowboys defeat the Buffalo Bills 30-13. George H.W. Bush was attending the Pontiac Silverdome in Michigan in 1982, where the San Francisco 49ers secured a 26-21 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. Meanwhile, Spiro Agnew was in attendance at Miami’s Orange Bowl in 1971, when the Baltimore Colts won over the Cowboys 16-13.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nFollowing his exit, Trump posted several clips, including footage of himself surrounded by cheering fans and another video that allegedly captured boos as Swift and Ice Spice were shown on the stadium’s Skycam. However, those videos failed to clarify if the crowd was cheering for him and booing Swift or if it was all occurring simultaneously.?\n\nTaylor Swift, who originally stayed politically neutral, publicly criticized Trump during his previous term. In 2019, she wrote a letter criticizing his opposition to the Equality Act, which aimed to expand civil rights protections to include sexual orientation and gender identity. She later called him out for “threatening violence” during the George Floyd protests in 2020 and accused him of “dismantling” the U.S. Postal Service ahead of the election that same year.\n\nFurthermore, as per The Mirror, the conflict between the two intensified after Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race. Last August, Trump shared AI-generated images falsely implying that Swift had endorsed him, though he later distanced himself from the misleading visuals. In September, he warned that Swift would “probably pay a price” for backing Harris.\n\nIn addition, Trump made it clear during a Fox News interview that he’s not very fond of the Blank Space singer. Trump said, “I’m not a Taylor Swift fan. It was only a matter of time before she endorsed a Democrat. She couldn’t possibly endorse Biden, but she’s very liberal and always backs Democrats. She’ll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.”\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nAfter the loss, Kansas City players reportedly spoke to the media and addressed some of their questions. But what was more interesting was that a reporter told Mirror US Sports that he saw Kelce crying as he left Caesars Superdome. Meanwhile, Swift, who was in attendance for the weekend game, was made fun of when she appeared on the big screen.\n\nWhile this loss might be a slight setback for player Travis Kelce, we are sure he and his team will fight back in the future. Swift has always been a fighter, and she’s not going to back down either.","summary":"Donald Trump took a jab at pop icon Taylor Swift after her boyfriend Travis Kelce's team, the Kansas City Chiefs, lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans during the Super Bowl.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trump-takes-a-dig-at-taylor-swift-after-kansas-city-chiefs-super-bowl-defeat","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Taylor-Swift-L-and-Donald-Trump-R.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-10 18:14:18","author":"Sweta Choudhury","authors":["Sweta Choudhury"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.035},{"id":289090614,"title":"Trump tries—and fails—to steal the spotlight from the Super Bowl","text":"As millions of people had their eyes glued to Sunday’s Super Bowl, President Donald Trump apparently needed to find a way to bring the attention back to him. Not only did he declare Feb. 9 as “Gulf of America Day,” but he called for abolishing the penny on his flight back from New Orleans.\n\nIn a post to Truth Social, Trump announced he had instructed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to stop minting America’s one-cent coins. \n\nHe wrote, “For far too long, the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful. Let’s rip the waste out of our great nations budget, even if it’s a penny at a time.”\n\nLike so many things Trump has tried to do or say since retaking the White House just last month, it’s not clear if he can unilaterally discontinue the penny. As The New York Times reported, congressional intervention would likely be required since the body dictates America’s currency specifications.\n\nHe is right about one thing, though: pennies cost more than they’re worth. A 2024 report from the U.S. Mint stated that the unit cost for pennies (3.69 cents)—and nickels, for what it’s worth—has exceeded their face value for the 19th consecutive fiscal year. A conservative estimate from a 2024 New York Times Magazine story said that roughly 240 billion pennies are lying around the nation—which amounts to about $7.24 for every man, woman, and child residing here. \n\nShould America move forward with Trump’s somewhat controversial plan, it wouldn’t be the first country to get rid of pennies. Canada sunsetted its one-cent coin more than a decade ago. Since then, cash transactions are now rounded to the nearest nickel. Australia, meanwhile, got rid of its one- and two-cent coins back in 1992.\n\nWhile Trump’s latest proposal might actually be a decent idea, it’s unclear if he was just trying to make news. After all, he made his announcement shortly after leaving the Super Bowl at halftime, when it became clear that his beloved Kansas City Chiefs were in for a beatdown. He didn’t even bother to watch Kendrick Lamar’s halftime performance (which MAGA seemed to hate) or congratulate the Philadelphia Eagles on their historic win, as he did for the Chiefs when they won the AFC Championship earlier this year. \n\nIt makes sense that Trump would hold a grudge against Philadelphia, though: The city overwhelmingly supported former Vice President Kamala Harris over him in this past year’s election. Trump also canceled a planned visit to the White House by the Eagles in 2018 citing a disagreement on standing during the national anthem. In truth, fewer than 10 Eagles players had committed to attending the White House event.\n\nIn fact, one of Trump’s only posts about the Super Bowl singled out … Taylor Swift. Swift endorsed Harris in the 2024 presidential election, and Trump hasn’t forgotten. In a late-night post to Truth Social, he argued that the pop star had a “tougher night” than the Chiefs after the team her boyfriend plays for lost by 18 points. \n\n“She got BOOED out of the Stadium,” Trump said, an apparent reference to Eagles’ fans booing Swift when she appeared on the jumbotron. “MAGA is very unforgiving!” (This, of course, isn’t true. Swift didn’t appear to care and instead laughed off Philadelphia fans.)\n\nMaybe Trump had a feeling that the Chiefs were in for a tough night. Or perhaps he just craves the spotlight (probably the latter). Before the Super Bowl, he announced aboard Air Force One that he had signed an executive order renaming the “Gulf of Mexico” to the “Gulf of America.”\n\nIn other Trump news, he sat down for an exclusive pre-Super Bowl interview with Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier and detailed his plans to instruct DOGE chair Elon Musk to probe the Education and Defense Departments for so-called wasteful spending. He also suggested that he fully trusts his billionaire buddy to fulfill his promise to cut red tape. And he doubled-down on his desire for Canada to join the U.S., though the country has said there’s zero desire to do this. \n\nWhy is it that Trump loves the spotlight and needs to make everything about him? If you ask his cronies in the White House, they’ll say his ubiquity is part of his attempt to solidify his base of support while striking a contrast with former President Joe Biden. But surely, Trump also wants to satiate his own ego. \n\n“As Politico summed it up best, ‘Trump is everywhere again,’” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during her first briefing in January. “And that’s because President Trump has a great story to tell.”","summary":"As millions of people had their eyes glued to Sunday’s Super Bowl, President Donald Trump apparently needed to find a way to bring the attention back to him. Not only did he declare Feb. 9 as “Gulf of America Day,” but he called for abolishing the penny on his flight back from New Orleans.\n\n\n\nIn a post to Truth Social, Trump announced he had instructed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to stop minting America’s one-cent coins. \n\n\n\nHe wrote, “For far too long, the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful. Let’s rip the waste out of our great nations budget, even if it’s a penny at a time.”\n\n\n\nLike so many things Trump has tried to do or say since retaking the White House just last month, it’s not clear if he can unilaterally discontinue the penny. As The New York Times reported, congressional intervention would likely be required since the body dictates America’s currency specifications.\n\n\n\nHe is right about one thing, though: pennies cost more than they’re","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/2/10/2302766/-Trump-tries-and-fails-to-steal-the-spotlight-from-the-Super-Bowl?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1397173/story_image/AP25041056317215.jpg?1739209754","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-10 18:05:09","author":"Alex Samuels","authors":["Alex Samuels"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.32},{"id":289053762,"title":"How Donald Trump Won the Super Bowl","text":"After Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles, the biggest winner of Super Bowl LIX may as well have been President Donald Trump himself.Trump, who became the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl on Sunday, scored a string of political, cultural and social victories before he even took his seat inside New Orleans' Superdome for the big game.By kickoff, the stage had been set for Trump to flex that ascendant power.After having it appear during NFL games for the last five seasons, the league arbuptly decided to remove the \"END RACISM\" lettering from the end zone—a slogan that was adopted in 2020 in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder and the subsequent Black Lives Matter protests that erupted across the nation. Instead, Sunday's end zones were emblazoned with the less overtly political message \"CHOOSE LOVE,\" a phrase the NFL has called \"appropriate\" in the wake of the New Orleans attack, the wildfires in California and the plane crashes in both Washington D.C. and Philadelphia.While the league denied that the slogan change was tied to the president's Super Bowl appearance, the move came amid Trump's greater efforts to ban diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs and shut down \"woke\" policies across the country.Trump also famously feuded with the NFL across his first term, taking issue with players who knelt during the national anthem in protest of racial injustice. The president had called for the league to fire former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who led the protest, and repeatedly attacked the league and its commissioner, Roger Goodell, on social media.Trump began Super Bowl Sunday by traveling from Mar-a-Lago to New Orleans, signing a proclamation that declared February 9 as inaugural \"Gulf of America Day\" as Air Force One made the short hop over the Gulf of Mexico. The stunt was the latest in his push to rename the body of water, an effort that has drawn pushback from Mexico's government.\"Today, I am making my first visit to the Gulf of America since its renaming,\" the proclamation stated. \"As my Administration restores American pride in the history of American greatness, it is fitting and appropriate for our great Nation to come together and commemorate this momentous occasion and the renaming of the Gulf of America.\"Before landing in New Orleans, the president also received good news from his favorite media punching bags at CBS, whose news division he is currently suing, alleging that the network's \"60 Minutes\" interview with Vice President Kamala Harris was deceptively edited to favor Harris and mislead the public. CBS has forcefully denied those allegations, though its parent company is reportedly considering a settlement in the case.Earlier on Sunday, CBS published a poll that showed Trump receiving high marks across the board after his first three weeks in office. A majority, 53 percent, of Americans said the approved of his handling of the presidency, while 47 percent disapproved. His ratings also marked the highest score Trump has seen since pollsters began tracking attitudes on his presidency. At the same juncture in February 2017, CBS News found that only 40 percent of Americans approved of Trump.The latest survey also found that a large majority, 70 percent, said Trump was doing what he promised in the campaign. The most common word used to describe the president was \"tough,\" a term used by 69 percent of respondents, followed by \"energetic,\" 63 percent, \"focused,\" 60 percent and \"effective,\" 48 percent.\"New polling from CBS News shows Americans are overwhelmingly positive about President Donald J. Trump's return to office and his commitment to making good on his promises,\" the White House celebrated in a Sunday email.Once in the Big Easy, Trump headed to the Caesars Superdome before kickoff to meet with the participants in the honorary coin toss, including the families of victims of the deadly New Year's Day terrorist attack, police and emergency personnel.His first appearance on the big screen came during the National Anthem, when the cameras panned to the commander-in-chief, who saluted from the stands as Jon Batiste sang, the Star-Spangled Banner. The crowd erupted into cheers at the sight of Trump.And though the president received a roaring welcome in New Orleans, superstar Taylor Swift—who earned Trump's ere in September for endorsing Harris—did not. Swift's image on the stadium Jumbotron was met with scattered boos from the audience. Trump delighted in his nemesis' harsh reception, suggesting on Truth Soical after the Eagles blew out Chiefs that Swift was the only one who had a worse night than her boyfriend's team.\"The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!\" Trump wrote.Trump picked the Chiefs to win in a pregame interview with Fox News (an annual ritual that former President Biden notoriously skipped last year — the first in a series of events that presaged his eventual decision to quit the race. But while the Chiefs collapsed on the gridiron, Philadelphia's championship produced another opportunity for the commander-in-chief to project his cultural influence.Super Bowl champs have visited the White House since 1980. But it wasn't until 2018 that a team was disinvited. Trump's decision to revoke the invite came after he learned that nearly all of the Eagles players — who had just defeated the New England Patriots for the 2017 championship —were planning to boycott the traditional visit in opposition to the president.\"The Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House with their full team to be celebrated tomorrow. They disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country,\" Trump said at the time.But with the cultural tide turning in Trump's favor, the Eagles seem less likely to snub the president this time around.\"I'd be honored to go, regardless of who the president is, but we'll see,\" Eagles captain and right tackle Lane Johnson told Sportico on Sunday night. \"It's ultimately a team decision. I'll do what's best for the team.\" Johnson is one of four players from the 2017 team who were disinvited from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue seven years ago.Newsweek reached out to the Philadelphia Eagles for comment on whether they plan to attend a White House celebration. Newsweek also reached out to the White House for comment about the status of the team's invitation but did not immediately hear back.","summary":"The Eagles weren't the only ones to win big Sunday night.

That’s no doubt because a much stronger statement was delivered midway through the second quarter when a pass by the Kansas City Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes was intercepted and returned for an touchdown by Philadelphia’s Cooper DeJean.\n\nDeJean, the first white player to start at cornerback in a Super Bowl in 24 years, has cheekily been described by media figures such as Bomani Jones as the league’s ultimate DEI hire. But while those comments have been made with tongues firmly planted in cheeks, there is some merit in describing the Eagles’ victory as a win for diversity, equity and inclusion – something that suddenly finds itself under attack in America.\n\nAfter all, Super Bowl LIX was never going to be just a game, not with the cultural storm brewing around the contest – not least Kendrick Lamar’s politically charged half-time show. But no force carried more momentum than the Chiefs coming into Sunday. They weren’t just playing for a third successive championship. They were carrying the mantle of America’s team in the second era of Donald Trump, who became the first sitting US president to attend a Super Bowl. At the same time, the NFL removed its longstanding antiracism slogans from the field, perhaps fearing Trump – who left the game early – would make it into yet another DEI issue to grandstand about.\n\nThere was no question which team the president came to see in New Orleans. Mahomes’s mother and brother took pictures with Trump. In the week before the game, the Chiefs’ star tight end Travis Kelce gushed about playing in front of the president despite Trump once writing in all caps that he hated the player’s girlfriend, Taylor Swift, after she threw her support behind Kamala Harris in the presidential election. (During the game he shared video of Swift being booed.) Trump picked Kansas City to three-peat, called Mahomes “a winner” and referred to his wife, accurately, as a “Maga fan.” Trump praised Chiefs fans for voting for him “in record numbers,” even though polling data shows Harris received substantially more votes in Kansas City’s more populous Missouri counties. And yet: from their wantonly offensive tomahawk chop cheer to the kicker who is besties with Maga senator Josh Hawley to the fact that the team plays in red, the Chiefs couldn’t appear in more lockstep with a Maga movement that’s hellbent on erasing 60 years of DEI gains. So it’s fitting that the most forceful rejection of this new political normal would come from Philadelphia, a city that hasn’t voted for a Republican president since 1932.\n\nPhilly sports fans don’t bow down to authority. They buck it. They (allegedly) booed Santa Claus and throw batteries at players they don’t like, whether on the opposite side or on theirs. They’re righteous in their loyalty and committed to their freedom of expression. They flooded downtown streets after the Eagles booked their Super Bowl ticket and climbed light poles that the city greased in advance to deter them. Dressed in their greenest finery on Sunday, Eagles fans descended on downtown New Orleans in the tens of thousands to boo the president, boo Mahomes and bear witness to a football insurrection. That the Eagles happen to be among the most diverse, equitable and inclusive teams in sports just made their upset all the sweeter.\n\nDEI is integral to the Eagles, an equal opportunity destroyer of dynasties. They enjoy doing things differently: seven years ago they stopped the New England Patriots from winning a second successive championship partly thanks to a trick play with a backup quarterback who caught the decisive pass. The team’s owner, Jeffrey Lurie, recently produced a film about an undocumented immigrant artist, a story he said he was “proud” to portray on screen. After lifting the Lombardi Trophy on Sunday, Lurie made a point of shouting out 200-plus members of the Eagles “support staff you’ll never hear about.” Among them is Autumn Lockwood, an Eagles performance guru who joined the team in 2023, becoming the first Black woman ever to be part of a Super Bowl-winning coaching staff.\n\nThe DEI – as many joke – cuts both ways. For the better part of two decades no NFL team featured a white cornerback, as white prospects have historically been stereotyped as too slow and clumsy to play a position that requires lightning speed and agility. But then last year the Eagles bucked convention and drafted DeJean out of Iowa, where he ranked among college football’s most outstanding defenders. By midseason DeJean emerged in the Eagles starting lineup along with safety Reed Blankenship, Philadelphia’s other white defensive back. Any time they make a big play fans cheer the Eagles’ “Exciting Whites,” nodding at the meme photograph of a supermarket wine section sign of the same name. DeJean and Blankenship’s suffocating coverage in the Super Bowl was part of a bruising effort that yielded arguably Mahomes’s worst performance as a pro to date. His two garbage-time touchdowns may have raised his final numbers, but they won’t erase the stain.\n\nBut in the grand scheme, Jalen Hurts is the finest example of the Eagles discarding old ways of thinking. He is a two-time college national champion and Heisman trophy finalist whom many pundits nonetheless believed was unqualified for the job of NFL quarterback. Some experts believed he might be better suited to play running back or receiver, positions Black quarterbacks have been pushed into in the past by talent evaluators who wrongheadedly mistook their athleticism for a lack of intelligence. Those same experts continued questioning Hurts’s credentials and ability when he replaced franchise quarterback Carson Wentz, who is white and now Mahomes’s backup on the Chiefs. Race aside, they considered Hurts to be vastly inferior to Mahomes even though he nearly beat him in the Super Bowl two years earlier. The kicker: Hurts entrusted his business affairs to a management team led entirely by women – and they promptly landed him the richest contract in NFL history at the time he signed it.\n\nFor two years Hurts kept a photo of himself downcast in the aftermath of the Eagles’ defeat to the Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII as his cell phone lock screen for motivation. But the image didn’t figure to haunt him for much longer on Sunday. After DeJean’s interception, Hurts threw a touchdown pass to AJ Brown that gave the Eagles a 24-0 lead at halftime. In the third quarter, Hurts connected with DeVonta Smith on a beautiful long pass that pushed the advantage to 34-0. In the end, Hurts’s performance wasn’t as dynamic as it had been two years ago, but it was impressive enough for the Eagles to pull him from the blowout with three minutes left to play so his backup could take the remaining snaps. “I can’t control what these people think,” Hurts said after being voted the game’s MVP. “But if it takes all the hate and all the scrutiny and all the different opinions for me to be a world champion, then keep it coming.”\n\nAt a time when the guardrails around democracy appear to be warping and snapping under the strain to make DEI the enemy of everything, the Eagles provide a heartening lesson in resistance. They didn’t give into a script that called for them to acquiesce in advance. They didn’t complain about the game being rigged. They just rolled up their sleeves and administered a good ol’ fashion Broad Street beatdown in front of the world. And when they take over the streets again to parade their championship team through their city with Eagles fans reveling in their rebel spirit, it shouldn’t be soon forgotten that it was DEI that did this, too.","summary":"Observers have jokingly pointed to Cooper DeJean as a diversity hire for the NFL champions.

His labor nominee presents a major test","text":"WASHINGTON (AFP): President Donald Trump has repeatedly challenged Senate Republicans with his Cabinet picks. But his nomination of Lori Chavez-DeRemer for labor secretary may be proving the hardest for many to accept. Chavez-DeRemer, a former congresswoman from Oregon, hardly cuts the profile of a traditional Republican nominee.\n\nShe is the daughter of a lifelong Teamsters member. She’s a small business owner who served as the mayor of a fast-growing suburb in liberal Portland, Oregon. And in the House, she co-sponsored legislation championed by America’s labor unions.\n\nThat background is why Trump, encouraged by some allies, nominated Chavez-DeRemer to lead the Labor Department. Her selection has scrambled the usual partisan divides, attracting some Democratic support even as her union-friendly stances generate concern and, in some cases, outright opposition from many Republicans. But that shakeup is exactly the goal for Trump and allied Republicans who aim to cast aside the party’s long-held antipathy toward unions and lure more voters away from the Democratic Party.\n\n“The party has changed,” said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., a proponent of Trump’s Cabinet nominees who says he speaks with Chavez-DeRemer on a regular basis. “If you look at the new coalition of supporters that President Trump brought to the party – labor being one of them – Lori’s a perfect person to kind of fit that gap,” he said.\n\nBut that view is far from unanimous across the GOP, with some Senate Republicans outright opposed to her confirmation. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who sits on the Senate committee overseeing labor issues, criticized Chavez-DeRemer’s past support for the PRO Act, saying the law would overturn state laws that require an employee be able to refrain from joining a labor union.\n\nYet Paul said he believes Chavez-DeRemer will likely be confirmed on an unusually bipartisan basis. “I think she’ll lose 15 Republicans and she’ll get 25 Democrats,” Paul told reporters. “But she’s very pro-labor. She might get all the Democrats, who knows.”\n\nIf confirmed, Chavez-DeRemer will confront growing challenges in the workplace at a time of resurgent union organizing. The Labor Department’s reach is vast, covering investigations into labor practices, debates over in-office and remote work, and concerns over automation as artificial intelligence products surge across the economy.\n\nChavez-DeRemer, like other Trump Cabinet nominees, has kept quiet ahead of her confirmation hearing, which is set for Wednesday. But in the past, she’s been blunt about her backing of organized labor. As a House member, she often welcomed union members into her office for meetings, and she touted her support from her district’s union chapters on the campaign trail.\n\n“In my district, unions aren’t the enemy of small businesses – they’re a partner. Small businesses benefit from the presence of unions. As a small business owner, I know this better than most,” Chavez-DeRemer said in a 2024 reelection ad.\n\nWhen she sat on the House subcommittee that oversees labor issues, Chavez-DeRemer was often absent from hearings that her Republican colleagues held to lambast unions. “When I was asked to be on that committee, I let them know ahead of time that I would be somewhat challenging maybe some of the views, and they are OK with that,” Chavez-DeRemer said during a 2023 interview with the union-run Northwest Labor Press.\n\nUnion leaders took notice. Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the largest labor unions in the country, is supporting Chavez-DeRemer and said she hopes Trump gives her “the power that President Roosevelt gave Francis Perkins,” the trailblazing labor secretary who oversaw the New Deal.\n\n“You already see the anti-labor people in the Republican Party trying to mount a case against her,” Weingarten said. “I thought it was important for those of us who believe in labor rights and worker empowerment to stand up and say that that this was unconventional and a positive appointment.”\n\nChavez-DeRemer’s nomination also has the support of Sean O’Brien, the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. He made waves ahead of last year’s election by speaking at the Republican convention before the Teamsters declined to endorse Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris for president.\n\nO’Brien approached Mullin after the election and floated Chavez-DeRemer’s name, arguing she could be an olive branch to organized labor, Mullin recalled. They then went together and pitched Trump on the idea.\n\nThe team-up would have been unimaginable in 2023 when O’Brien lambasted Mullin as a “greedy CEO who pretends like he’s self-made” at a hearing that nearly devolved into a fistfight. But in the interceding years, they’d developed a friendship over sports, fitness, and the politics of work.\n\n“We’re a bit of an odd couple, I guess,” Mullin said.\n\nTrump’s outreach to voters from once heavily unionized communities has been a driving force behind the new union-friendly approach. Others in the party have been working toward the same goal. Conservative academics and policy aides have been organizing behind the scenes for years as part of an effort to shift the GOP’s thinking on economics.\n\n“At a high level, the change has been a shift from defaulting to a pro-business perspective,” said Abigail Ball, the executive director at American Compass, a conservative think tank.\n\nBall said the failure of globalization has pushed many conservatives toward a new approach. “I think the American people very much realized that trade and the cheap TV was not worth the loss of strong communities and the ability for a guy who did not go to college to support his family on one income,” Ball said.\n\nRepublican senators are broadly receptive to Chavez-DeRemer’s nomination. But several have noted how unconventional the pick is for a Republican president.\n\n“She voted for the PRO Act. I don’t like that. But I like her. I think she’ll be good,” said Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala.\n\n“My attitude is the president won the election and he’s entitled to his team, absent extraordinary circumstances,” said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. “She’s maybe not somebody I would have chosen, but that’s not the question as far as I’m concerned.”\n\nSome Republican senators with a more populist bent hope Chavez-DeRemer’s nomination serves as a nod to the party’s changing base, which has come to include more working-class voters in traditionally unionized service and manufacturing jobs.\n\n“I think she understands the need to have strong unions to have a strong labor voice and protect labor,” said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who sits on the Senate committee overseeing labor issues. “We need more American jobs at better wages. We need more good union jobs,” Hawley said. “I think she understands that.”","summary":"WASHINGTON (AFP): President Donald Trump has repeatedly challenged Senate Republicans with his Cabinet picks.

Ohio bill would end bans","text":"COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A new bill could shake up suburbia by creating a right to plant political yard signs—even if your homeowner’s association says you can’t.\n\nHouse Bill 16 would let HOAs and local governments keep “reasonable restrictions” about where, when, how big and how many signs people displayed. But outright bans would be prohibited. \n\n“My view of HOAs, personally, is to delegate authority and responsibility for aesthetics, landscaping and things of that nature,” said state Rep. Brian Lorenz, a Powell Republican.\n\nThe idea for HB 16 came from a Democratic constituent who wanted to display her sign for Vice President Kamala Harris. She was stopped from doing so by her HOA rules.\n\n“That’s not right,” Lorenz said. “It’s a free speech thing.”\n\nEight out of 10 single family homes built in the U.S. come with an HOA, according to data from the Foundation for Community Association Research. And about 75 million Americans already live in one. They often come with property restrictions, such as limits on the height of your fence or the colors you can paint your house, and they collect fees from property owners for upkeep of common areas.\n\n“You make a choice to be part of an HOA with full knowledge of what the restrictions are,” said Gary Daniels, a lobbyist for the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio. “But you’re talking a lot less about choice these days.”\n\nOhio already blocks associations from restricting displays of the US. and POW/MIA flags. Republicans failed to add thin blue line flags to that list during the last legislative session. \n\nThe ACLU of Ohio opposed the thin blue line bill because it targeted specific speech, but it does not yet have a position on the broader restriction against HOA sign bans.\n\n“Our concern was that they were putting their finger on the scale and saying only this one type of expression.

Since signing a major-label record deal in 2022, Michael and Tanya Trotter — known for their blend of rootsy R&B and country gospel — have become mainstays at awards shows, performed at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in November, and earned high-profile duetting slots with everyone from Zach Bryan to Ringo Starr. \n\n Before starting the band, Michael served in Iraq and began playing piano in one of Saddam Hussein’s abandoned palaces. Tanya, meanwhile, came up as a Nineties R&B singer whose solo career never quite took off. Both struggled with severe mental-health issues but have flourished in their partnership since meeting at a music festival, getting married and forming the War and Treaty. If their backstory feels like the stuff of Hollywood, that’s because it is: A feature-length film based on their lives is in the works.\n\n Their new album, Plus One, represents the group’s first full-fledged attempt at carving a space in mainstream country music. Tunes that reference country roads and chugging double shots of whiskey sit alongside the duo’s trademark message of fostering hope and connection. “We knew that Nashville had something to offer us,” says Michael, “but we also knew that we’ve got something to offer Nashville.”\n\n You co-wrote with Miranda Lambert for this album. What was that like?Tanya: She’s really a genius. I don’t think people know the magnitude of her as a vocal producer. \n\n Michael: I was trying to get something done on my end, and I called her for advice. I wanted to know what I should be expecting earlier on our journey with Universal, our label. And she’s like, “Remember who you are! Put your foot down. Grab a pair! Be who you are, and remember why they signed you.” I was like, “Holy shit, yes, Miranda. You got it.” \n\n Still, the majority of the songs are written exclusively by you two, which is rare in mainstream country.Michael: We wanted to make sure that Nashville knew that we weren’t hands off. We spent the time, we’ve been in the bars and the dives, and we spent our time doing some line dancing down at the Nashville Palace. We’ve eaten at [Lambert’s Broadway honky-tonk] Casa Rosa’s; we’ve frequented the Opry, we’ve frequented the Ryman, and gone to the museums. We’re in the culture of Nashville, and writing with these writers, who help create the soundtrack to the culture of Nashville, was a dream come true to us. But we also realized that we had a lot to say, and we had a lot to say that only we could say. \n\n Some of your new songs feel like they could exist on country radio. Is that a specific goal?Tanya: If you’re going to be in larger conversations, you have to try your hand at having something that a listener that listens to a Morgan Wallen or a Luke Combs or a Chris Stapleton can hear your music and say “I hear them coming right behind a Chris Stapleton on radio.” That’s not your end goal, but I thinkit is a goal.\n\n Michael, a few years ago you said you didn’t want the War and Treaty to only be known as “the kumbaya cats.” Do you still feel that way?Michael: We are more hopeful in our human race than the normal guy or gal. I remember there was a period where we were trying to get people to say, “Look, we are one. Don’t play into division,” and there were people who were angry with me and Tanya about that. They were like, “You’re Black. This is the moment where you should be pissed the fuck off.” But what they don’t realize is, when I raised my hand to serve this country, I took off the cloak of “Black man” and I put on the cloak of “Army, protecting my country, protecting all of us.” So the first feeling I feel is hurt, not anger, when I see police brutality. Hurt, not anger, when I see racial disparity or pain. That don’t make me a kumbaya guy. I have to be careful with my anger, because my anger is something different. Anger, for me, is fuel; it makes me look for an enemy. And when I find the enemy, I am trained to seek and destroy. It’s more beneficial for me to follow my mentor, when he stood in the courtyard in Alabama, and he held the hands of my wife and my son. His name was John Lewis, and he said, “We are stronger together as brothers and sisters.” \n\n So, yes, this isn’t going away anytime soon. I am not, and neither is my wife, kumbaya people. This is our choice. We choose to point people to a better America, and a better world. \n\n What you just articulated speaks to the layers of expectations placed upon Black performers, in particular.Michael: Me and Tanya, we were in a pivotal moment in history where we came out and supported the Democratic candidate, which is something I never really do because of my position as a veteran. This election, it felt like there was a calling to make a stand, and we did. A lot of people felt heard by that, and there were a lot of people who felt betrayed, like we weren’t hearing them. The power of your celebrity is to stand in the middle of the road and hold your arms out and find a way to pull your brothers and your sisters together. \n\n So you felt, after the fact, that endorsing Kamala Harris worked against the message the War and Treaty stand for?Michael: I think it did work against it. Whether we came out for her or President Trump, what we learned is everyone is feeling like they aren’t being heard. We want to be a bridge, and a beacon, and a balm for healing. There’s a way to go through your career being a unifier rather than a divider. \n\n You’ve collaborated with all sorts of artists recently: Zach Bryan, Reneé Rapp, Bon Jovi, Post Malone. Is introducing the War and Treaty to new audiences a big part of your overall project?Tanya: In some of those moments, you don’t even know why you’re there. For me, this year it’s all about knowing why you’re there and being deliberate in your presence. Don’t do something just because you’re asked to do it. There has to be some kind of vision.… As you’re building, you don’t think about where you’re putting the brick, you’re just building. It’s important to know, even as you’re still growing as a band, “Even though this looks great and may be a great opportunity, we’re going to say no here.” This year, we’ve really grown into really saying no. \n\n The War and Treaty have been clear about their mission since day one: inclusion and hope, and bridge building, as Michael put it. Does that statement feel the same as when you first started, or has it evolved?Tanya: I’ve had to evolve, because my neurological system cannot handle the level of hate and divisiveness. It’s been a serious self-check for me to say “I’m going to pursue peace at all costs.” I don’t think you can, in a healthy way, stay in that toxic environment. Some people thrive in that environment: They’re looking for the fight. That’s not who I am. You can put a message out there that you want hope and unity, and what happens is, it’s challenged because the other side says “The only way to really know if you’re a person of peace is to be challenged with hate.” I’ve gotten to a point where I really still believe in this message, but I’m no longer going to put myself in an environment that consistently challenges my message. That’s just me.\n\n Michael: I differ, of course. I feel like that message has gotten stronger in me. My desire is stronger for us, even in just this country, to heal, and to talk, and to shake each other’s hands. I don’t give any credence to the ignorant things that don’t serve. I pay attention to who is right in front of my face. I want that person to know that they are loved, that they are wanted, and that they are needed in my life. As long as I’m living like that, I’m following the mission and purpose that I’ve been in service to. To me, that’s healing.","summary":"The husband-and-wife vocal duo talk about embracing country music, supporting Kamala Harris, and rejecting division","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/the-war-and-treaty-new-album-interview-1235260346/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WT_SM-84_HIres_WEB_FINAL.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-10 16:47:59","author":"Jonathan Bernstein,Steven Pearl","authors":["Jonathan Bernstein","Steven Pearl"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.385},{"id":289029038,"title":"Donald Trump mocks Taylor Swift after she gets booed at Super Bowl 2025: ‘MAGA is very unforgiving’","text":"US President Donald Trump did not shy away from taunting pop sensation Taylor Swift on Sunday, after her partner Travis Kelce’s side Kansas City Chiefs was defeated in the Super Bowl LIX.Both Trump and Swift attended the 2025 Super Bowl at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.

His historic victory over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the November 2024 elections marked one of the most significant political comebacks in contemporary US history. The inauguration ceremony, attended by several prominent world leaders, was held inside the US Capitol Rotunda.\n\nOwing to Trump’s sudden moves, in recent news, Donald Trump has directed the US Treasury Department to stop coining new pennies as the president agreed to yet another of Elon Musk’s ideas amid growing concern about the Tesla CEO’s rapidly extending power.\n\nTrump called pennies “wasteful” as he announced the decision on his Truth Social site during his Super Bowl appearance on Sunday night. He wrote, “For far too long, the United States has minted pennies, which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful! I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies. Let’s rip the waste out of our great nation’s budget, even if it’s a penny at a time.”\n\nThe change comes from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) pointing out the high cost of penny production in a post on X. “The penny costs over 3 cents to make, costing US taxpayers over $179 million in FY2023. The Mint produced more than 4.5 billion pennies last year, making up about 40% of the 11.4 billion coins minted for circulation. Penny (or 3 cents!) for your thoughts,” the department stated. As per The Mint, the penny was first issued by the government in 1793. Since 1909, the profile of President Abraham Lincoln has adorned the obverse side of the coin, which is made of zinc and copper.\n\nAs per The Irish Star, in the 2024 fiscal year, the US Mint declared a loss of $85.3 million from producing nearly 3.2 billion pennies, with each one costing nearly $0.037 to manufacture—an increase from $0.031 the previous year. However, it remains uncertain whether Trump has the authority to eliminate the penny on his own, as Congress determines currency principles.\n\nMoreover, Robert K. Triest, an economics professor at Northeastern University, suggested there might be a legal pathway. “Discontinuing the penny in the US is a complex process. It would likely require congressional approval, but the Secretary of the Treasury might have the authority to halt new penny production simply,” he explained last month.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nTrump’s decision to stop minting pennies appears to be just one of several controversial actions influenced by his newly appointed “special government employee,” Musk. In a matter of weeks, the SpaceX CEO has disrupted US politics with his push to overhaul the federal government. Meanwhile, judges have also banned Donald Trump’s plans for mass federal buyouts and efforts to place thousands of USAID employees on leave. Now, Trump administration officials are questioning the judiciary’s authority to limit executive power.\n\nMusk has led efforts to gain access to classified country databases, played a key role in persuading federal employees to take “deferred resignations,” and even announced the closure of an entire federal agency. However, these drastic measures have faced legal roadblocks, as courts have temporarily halted Trump and Musk’s attempts to dismantle agencies and slash federal jobs.\n\nInstagram पर यह पोस्ट देखें\n\nOn 8 February 2025, a federal judge ruled against Musk’s DOGE, blocking its access to Treasury Department records containing sensitive personal data, including Social Security and bank account details of millions of Americans. In response, Musk demanded the judge’s impeachment, stating, “A corrupt judge protecting corruption. He must be impeached NOW!”","summary":"Donald Trump has directed the US Treasury Department to stop coining new pennies.
