Fundraising. This speaks to Trump's money issues—both he and Vance are spending precious time in New York on Oct. 27.\"According to the invitation, the event features several tiers of \"experiences,\" with the top-tier \"Ultra MAGA Experience\" priced at $924,600. The options include:\n- \"Team Trump 2024 Experience\": $250,000 to give or $500,000 to raise\n- \"Team America First Experience\": $100,000 to give or $200,000 to raise\n- \"Club 47 Experience\": $50,000 to give or $70,000 to raise\n- \"MAGA 24 Experience\": $35,000 to give\n- \"President's Club Experience\": $5,000 to give\nNewsweek contacted Trump's campaign via email on Monday for comment.Trump's decision to host a rally in New York City, where he lived most of his life until 2019, is a curious move considering recent polling data.According to Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight polling, as of October 14, Harris holds a significant lead over Trump in New York. The poll shows Harris at 53.8 percent compared to Trump's 39.9 percent, a 14-point advantage. The polling average has a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.FiveThirtyEight's analysis includes several recent polls that consistently favor Harris. An ActiVote poll conducted from September 4 to September 30 showed Harris leading with 61 percent to Trump's 39 percent.An Emerson College survey from September 23 to September 25 put Harris at 56 percent and Trump at 42 percent. Two Siena College polls conducted from September 11 to September 16 indicated 55 percent and 52 percent support for Harris versus 42 and 40 for Trump, respectively.Madison Square Garden (MSG), known primarily for live sports and entertainment and called The World's Most Famous Arena, is home to the NBA's New York Knicks and NHL's New York Rangers.The venue has also played host to numerous political events and controversial gatherings. Its history includes Democratic and Republican national conventions, visits from world leaders and religious figures such as popes, and a Nazi rally in 1939.Trump's relationship with his former home state has been tumultuous in recent years. New Yorkers have held numerous protests against him, sometimes outside Trump Tower, chanting, \"New York hates you\" as he passes by.In May, a jury in New York convicted Trump on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Trump has maintained his innocence, describing the legal proceedings as \"lawfare.\"Despite the challenging poll numbers, Trump expressed confidence during a recent rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania. \"We just rented Madison Square Garden,\" he told supporters. \"It hasn't been done in many decades. But we're gonna make ... how can New York be run worse than it is right now?\"","summary":"The exclusive event offers a top-tier $924,600 \"Ultra MAGA Experience\" at Madison Square Garden, despite Trump substantially trailing Harris in N.Y. polls.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-exclusive-fundraising-event-new-york-city-1968992","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2495201/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 01:02:50","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.193},{"id":259697034,"title":"Harris turns Trump’s threats on ‘enemy within’ against him as she campaigns in battleground Pennsylvania","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris warned voters in a key Pennsylvania town that Donald Trump intends to take revenge on Americans who fail to support him if he succeeds in his push to win a second term in the White House, calling the former president “increasingly unstable and unhinged.”\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of supporters at an Erie, Pennsylvania, on Monday, Harris called the twice-impeached, felonious former president “someone who will stop at nothing to claim power for himself,” citing his long history of comments that express contempt for the Constitution and the recent Supreme Court decision giving presidents sweeping immunity from prosecution for any crimes committed while carrying out their official duties. \n\nBut Harris told the crowd, which a campaign official estimated at roughly 6,000, that they don’t have to take her word for it when it comes to Trump’s malign intent.\n\nShe asked staff to “roll the clip” on what she said was an example of Trump’s “worldview and intentions” — a segment from an interview he sat for with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. \n\nIn it, Trump tells the financial correspondent — a strong and vocal supporter of his who repeatedly broadcast lies about the conduct of the 2020 election — that “the enemy from within,” his term for Americans who do not support him or vote for Republicans, are “more dangerous” than foreign adversaries such as Russia or China. \n\n“We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think they're the and it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary by the military,” he said, facing no pushback from the Fox personality.\n\nHarris told the crowd: “He's talking about the enemy within our country. Pennsylvania, he's talking about that he considers anyone who doesn't support him or who will not bend to his will, enemy of our country. It's saying that he would use the military to go after them.”\n\n“Think about this ... we know who he would target because he has attacked them before,” she said, listing journalists whose stories displease him and election officials “who refuse to cheat” for him among Trump’s potential targets if handed power once more.\n\nA second Trump term, Harris added, “would be a huge risk for America” because Trump “is increasingly unstable and unhinged, and he is for unchecked power.”\n\n“He wants to send the military after American citizens. He He has worked to prevent women from making their own health care decisions and threaten your fundamental freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride,” she said. \n\nThe vice president called on supporters to “answer the call” by voting for her in November, closing her remarks by telling supporters that they “know what is at stake.”\n\nCiting Erie County’s longtime bellwether status, she said “now is the time” for residents to “make your plan to vote.”\n\n“The election is here, and we need to organize, we need to mobilize, we need to energize folks, and we need to remind everybody that their vote is their voice, and your voice is your power,” she said.","summary":"The Vice President is taking the fight to Trump as polls tighten with just three weeks until Americans go to the polls on Election Day","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/harris-rally-trump-enemy-threats-pennsylvania-b2629221.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/15/01/SEI225645328.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/uAyxLX2X-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-15 00:48:57","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":259696486,"title":"Meghan McCain slams ABC’s Martha Raddatz over JD Vance interview: ‘Sounds psychotic’","text":"Meghan McCain slammed ex-ABC colleague Martha Raddatz on Sunday over an interview with Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance. \n\nRaddatz, 71, downplayed apartment takeovers by Venezuelan migrant gang members in Aurora, Colo., telling Vance, 40, that the “incidents” involving the ruthless Tren de Aragua crime syndicate were “limited to a handful.” \n\nMcCain, 39, was left in disbelief over the line of questioning by the “This Week” host. \n\n“It’s really insane Martha and her producers didn’t see how awful her line of questioning sounds to a normal person,” she wrote on X. “I’m sure she would have different feelings if she lived next to an apartment complex filled w/ Venezuelan gangs.” \n\nMcCain, a former co-host on ABC’s “The View,” added that Raddatz sounded “psychotic” during her interview with the Ohio senator. \n\n“She sounds psychotic.

Women now lean far more to the left than men and are significantly more likely to vote for center-left and left parties like the Democrats in the US or Labor and the Greens in Australia — by up to 10 percentage points. Men? In a modern retaliation against women’s gains, they’re twisting the other way, counteracting identities like generation, class and race that usually determine how people vote.\n\nSignified and signifiers\n\nIt’s more than votes (or the fact that in both the US and Australia there are just more women voters than men). Women are also more likely to be doing the hard grind of activism on the ground, knocking on doors and getting the vote out.\n\nCentre-left strategists look over their shoulders at examples like South Korea’s 2022 presidential election, where the populist right overtly mobilised incel-style misogyny to split the once reliably progressive youth vote along gender lines. \n\nThink of the Democrat strategy as the balance between the signified and the signifiers: when Vice President Kamala Harris talks policy, she talks (like Labor in Australia) to women about the care economy, domestic violence and abortion (contextualised into women’s health); when she talks symbols, she nods to men by pulling out her Glock (metaphorically speaking, at least).\n\nThe difference showed up in her media blitz last week, when she talked to women on Call Her Daddy and The View, and when she reached out to men (and women) through free-to-air 60 Minutes or to radio host Howard Stern. \n\nMeanwhile, the right-wing media is working hard at pumping the misogyny that’s driving the backlash. “Of course Kamala hates men,” says The American Spectator. “Too Stupid to be President”, reckons The Federalist.\n\nIt’s no surprise that the Murdoch family media is at the heart of it, with Fox News’ prime-time host Jesse Watters smirking Harris would be “paralysed in the Situation Room while the generals have their way with her”. \n\nIt’s not Rupert anymore. It’s Elon\n\nThe right’s media misogyny teaches us another lesson. Suddenly, it’s not Rupert — and much less Lachlan — who’s pulling the strings.\n\nThose Fox bedtime stories might still work with the network’s carefully nurtured grumpy-old-man demographic. But now, it’s Elon Musk, using the X algorithm and his personal rocket-thrusting image to send the Donald Trump macho vibe resonating through the far more dangerous — and younger — manosphere with the perception of “a permissive environment” for the creation of new accounts that followed “known abusive and misogynistic channels”.\n\nThe platform formerly known as Twitter has become Musk’s loud hailer. “Musk has spent nearly two years installing his own account as X’s main character and shaping the platform’s architecture in his own image. The politics of X are inextricably linked to Musk’s own politics,” as Charlie Warzel wrote head-shakingly in The Atlantic last month. \n\nMusk is also bringing his clout into Australian politics with high-profile attacks on Anthony Albanese.\n\nBut unlike Rupert, Musk is not content with pulling strings behind the scenes. The Republican Party has contracted out its get-out-the-vote strategy to Musk’s America Political Action Commission while Trump has foreshadowed appointing his fellow billionaire as a government efficiency czar.\n\nThe migrant obsession\n\nIt’s not just misogyny: central to the right-wing narrative in both Australia and the US (and across much of Europe) is the obsession with migration. The US campaign exposes the global right’s far more racist campaign against all migrants and migrant communities.\n\nTrump has long centred attacks on migrants in his campaigns, but he’s hurried past the keep-’em-out “build the wall” mantra, this year embracing the ugliest aspects of kick-’em-out race-thinking, threatening mass deportations, including revocation of citizenship and residency.\n\nAustralia’s not there yet, but we’re not far off. From semiotics to slogans, the shocking weekend demonstration in Corowa came straight out of America. The Trumpist attacks on Haitian Americans in Ohio and Venezuelan Americans in Colorado rhymed with 2018’s “African gangs” in western Melbourne. Dutton’s call in August to ban all Palestinian migrants clapped back at Trump’s own Muslim ban. \n\nThe strategy works so well that some emerging left parties in Europe (such as Germany’s Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance) are embracing anti-migrant rhetoric as part of their populist agenda.\n\nIn more “macho posturing” (as Tanya Plibersek recently characterised the current dominant political style in Australia), the Murdoch tabloids and Liberal Party have embraced selective visa cancellation of people they don’t like as a test of strength. The Democrats, like centre-left parties everywhere, are trying to walk both sides, avoiding the subject when they can, leaning into a soft restrictionary rhetoric when they can’t.\n\nWhy is the right so obsessed with migration? Blame that, too, on the backlash.\n\nAre you concerned about the gender divide in politics? Let us know your thoughts by writing to letters@crikey.com.au.

Nearly 160,000 voters in the state cast ballots for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in the GOP presidential primary this year — with her numbers proving stronger among suburban voters — even after she had already dropped out of the race against former President Donald Trump.\n\n“The Harris campaign’s path to win Pennsylvania capitalizes on Trump’s unprecedented weakness in the suburbs,” reads the memo, which also highlighted the campaign’s focus on Haley voters. “We have flipped the suburbs from red to blue since Trump won them in 2020, and we have also grown our support with women and tripled our support among white college educated voters in the state.”\n\nThe campaign cited surveys last month from The Philadelphia Inquirer/The New York Times/Siena College and Marist College that both showed Harris up 6 percentage points over Trump in the suburbs — a notable improvement from Trump’s 3-point victory over Biden among suburban Pennsylvanians in 2020, as exit polls showed. (The results in both of the surveys last month fell within their margins of error.)\n\nRecent surveys have found the overall race in Pennsylvania to be within the margin of error for polls, with a survey from Quinnipiac University this month finding Harris up 3 points, an Inquirer/Times/Siena survey finding her up 4 points and The Wall Street Journal having Trump up 1 point.\n\nIt’s the most sought-after battleground on the map, offering the most Electoral College votes among the hotly contested states, and it is the most frequent campaign destination for both Harris and Trump.\n\nTrump’s “weakness in the suburbs means that for him to actually win, he has to double and triple down on his base in the reddest counties in the state,” said Brendan McPhillips, a senior adviser to Harris’ Pennsylvania campaign. “And so we are going on offense and going to places where he thinks he has a strength and competing.”\n\nThe campaign highlighted events that Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have held in red counties like Johnstown, Lancaster and Rochester. It also detailed investments made in red parts of the state to “cut margins and stop Trump’s only hope of victory,” noting that 16 of its 50 statewide campaign offices are in counties Trump won by more than 10 points in 2020.\n\nRecent presidential elections in Pennsylvania have been exceptionally close. Biden defeated Trump in 2020 by just over 1 point. In 2016, Trump beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by an even slimmer margin.\n\n“With most polls showing this to be a margin of error race, we are also going on offense with rural voters to cut into Trump’s margins — a critical advantage as Trump’s team lacks the ground game capacity to conduct persuasion and mobilization campaigns simultaneously,” the Harris campaign memo reads.\n\nMcPhillips said improving on Biden’s margins in those counties by just 1 to 2 points would effectively cut off Trump’s path to flipping the state red.\n\n“We’re eating into his margins in a way that cannot sustain a victory,” he said. “And that is how we’re going to beat him, and it’s how we’re able to play offense on so many fronts.”\n\nThe campaign highlighted that as of Sunday it had knocked on more than 1 million doors across the state, including 250,000 over the weekend, since Harris replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket. It also referred to its 50 offices and 450 on-the-ground staff members.\n\nHarris has so far spent far more time in the western part of the state, including rural areas, than she has in the Philadelphia market, which McPhillips said is partly to help introduce her to voters who may be less familiar with her.\n\nFor Trump, billionaire mogul Elon Musk ramped up his political engagement in the state this month through his America PAC, which is working to turn out the vote for Trump.\n\nMcPhillips dismissed the potential impact of that effort.\n\n“They can’t scale up to the level that we’re at,” he said. “Even with Elon Musk’s money, you can’t spend enough money to scale up an operation to match ours. It’s too late. You needed to start in March, February, January, and they’ve just been phoning it in for so long. It’s going to be close, for sure. We’ve always been planning for it to be so. But that planning manifests itself in the fact that we actually had a plan, not a concept of one.”\n\nThe Trump campaign said the Harris campaign is papering over a problem it faces in Pennsylvania cities — particularly Philadelphia, the most vote-rich locale for Democrats in the state.\n\n“They can point to the suburbs, but they’re losing ground in places like Philadelphia,” a Trump campaign official said. “It’s exactly why [former President Barack] Obama was just pleading to African American men to vote for her. They’ve sounded the alarms, and they know they’re losing.”\n\nThe Trump campaign also pointed to Republicans’ having significantly cut into the Democratic voter registration advantage in the state while flipping Bucks, Luzerne and Beaver counties to Republican registration edges. It further highlighted reports that working-class voters in Philadelphia have embraced Trump.\n\nKush Desai, the Trump campaign’s Pennsylvania spokesperson, highlighted Obama’s visit as a sign the Harris team was scrambling. “An Obama visit isn’t going to convince Pennsylvanians to vote for another four years of open borders, rising prices, and disaster at home and abroad,” Desai said in a statement.\n\nIn its memo, the Harris campaign said it believes it will be able to “at least match” Biden’s support in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia in his victory in those cities four years ago. It went into greater detail about its efforts to reach Black voters in the state, including the staff members it has dedicated to outreach and engagement and its events focused on Black voters.\n\nLast week, Obama offered unscripted remarks during a Pittsburgh campaign stop in which he said his understanding of the race is that “we have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running. … [T]hat seems to be more pronounced with the brothers.”\n\nSeeking to speak directly to Black men, he pushed for undecideds to get behind Harris, saying her record deserves their support.\n\n“This is excellence on display, and it needs to be rewarded,” Obama said.\n\nState Sen. Vincent Hughes told NBC News he could “understand the frustration” Obama expressed.\n\n“Maybe the tone should have been a little bit different,” he said. “But let’s be real clear about this. Let’s get to the substance of what he said. There’s nothing in Donald Trump’s background, career, anything that should lead any citizen, let alone Black men, to vote for him. He’s not a successful businessman. … He was sued for discrimination in housing.”\n\nHughes said the Harris campaign is going to hit its targets among both Black men and voters in Philadelphia, adding that he has seen a flood of campaign activity there recently that has outpaced what Democrats were doing in 2020 during the worst of the Covid pandemic.\n\n“It’s going in the right way for the vice president,” he said. “Look, for a woman and for a Black woman, it’s always harder. It’s not fair, it’s not right, but it’s always harder. Maybe if we break through with this election, we can finally smash that glass ceiling and not make it so hard for the next one.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris’ campaign laid out what it sees as her&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris identifies suburbs in Pennsylvania as key to winning strategy first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kamala-harris-identifies-suburbs-in-pennsylvania-as-key-to-winning-strategy/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-sees-path-to-victory-in.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 00:03:19","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.012},{"id":259696446,"title":"Trump aims to expand domestic military use if reelected","text":"During his first term as president, Donald Trump tested the limits of how he could use the military to achieve policy goals.

Speaking in Colorado on Friday, the Republican described the city of Aurora as a “war zone” controlled by Venezuelan gangs, even though authorities say that was a single block of the Denver suburb, and the area is safe again.\n\n“I will rescue Aurora and every town that has been invaded and conquered,” Trump said at the rally. “We will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail or kick them out of our country.”\n\nIn an interview aired on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” Trump was asked about the potential of “outside agitators” disrupting Election Day and he pivoted to what he called “the enemy from within.”\n\n“I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within,” Trump said.

And I think they’re the big — and it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can’t let that happen.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly invoked the phrase “enemy from within” in recent speeches. On Saturday, he used it to refer to Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a prominent Trump critic who oversaw the congressional investigation that led to Trump's first impeachment. Schiff is now running for the Senate.\n\nThe former president and his advisers are developing plans to shift the military’s priorities and resources, even at a time when wars are raging in Europe and the Middle East. Trump’s top priority in his platform, known as Agenda 47, is to implement hardline measures at the U.S.-Mexico border by “moving thousands of troops currently stationed overseas” to that border. He is also pledging to “declare war” on cartels and deploy the Navy in a blockade that would board and inspect ships for fentanyl.\n\nTrump also has said he will use the National Guard and possibly the military as part of the operation to deport millions of immigrants who do not have permanent legal status.\n\nWhile Trump’s campaign declined to discuss the details of those plans, including how many troops he would shift from overseas assignments to the border, his allies are not shy about casting the operation as a sweeping mission that would use the most powerful tools of the federal government in new and dramatic ways.\n\n“There could be an alliance of the Justice Department, Homeland Security and the Department of Defense. Those three departments have to be coordinated in a way that maybe has never been done before,” said Ron Vitiello, who worked as the acting director of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement under Trump.\n\nWhile both Democratic and Republican presidential administrations have long used military resources at the border, the plans would be a striking escalation of the military’s involvement in domestic policy.\n\nAdvocates for human rights and civil liberties have grown alarmed.\n\n“They are promising to use the military to do mass raids of American families at a scale that harkens back to some of the worst things our country has done,” said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, an immigration advocacy organization.\n\nIn Congress, which has the power to restrict the use of military force through funding and other authorizations, Republicans are largely on board with Trump's plans.\n\n“The reason I support Donald Trump is he will secure the border on Day 1. Now that could be misinterpreted as being a dictator. No, he’s got to secure the border,” said Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., a member of the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nMany Republicans argue that Trump’s rhetoric on immigration reflects reality and points to the need for military action.\n\n“There is a case that this is an invasion,” said North Carolina Sen. Ted Budd, a Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. “You look at 10 million people, many of which are not here for a better future, and, unfortunately, it’s made it necessary. This is a problem that the Biden administration and Harris administration have created.”\n\nStill, Trump’s plans to move military assets from abroad could further inflame tension within the GOP between those hawkish on foreign policy and Republicans who promote Trump’s brand of “America First” isolationism.\n\nRepublican Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, insisted Trump would not move active-duty troops to the border, even though Trump’s platform clearly states he would.\n\nIn the Senate, where more traditional Republicans still hold sway, Mississippi Sen.

Mark Milley, resisted those plans, including issuing a memo that stressed that every member of the military “swears an oath to support and defend the Constitution and the values embedded within it.”\n\nTrump’s potential actions would likely require him to invoke wartime or emergency powers, such as carrying out mass deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law, or quelling unrest under the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that allows a president to deploy the military domestically and against U.S. citizens. It was last used by President George H.W.

He added: “We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think they’re the big — and it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can’t let that happen.”\n\nTrump beat Hillary Clinton by more than 40,000 votes in Pennsylvania on his way to winning the presidency in 2016. But Joe Biden, a Scranton native, beat Trump by about 80,000 votes in the state four years ago.\n\nHarris will be holding a rally in Erie, a Democratic majority city of about 94,000 people bordered by suburbs and rural areas with significant numbers of Republicans. Erie County is often cited as one of the state’s reliable bellwether regions, where the electorate has a decidedly moderate voting record. Trump visited Erie on Sept. 29.\n\nHarris, 59, in the rally speech will also criticize Trump for only releasing limited information about his health over the years, according to the campaign official.\n\nThe White House on Saturday released a letter from Harris’ doctor that summarizes her medical history declaring the vice president is in “excellent health” and “possesses the physical and mental resiliency” required to be president.\n\nIf Trump, who is 78, were to be elected next month, he would be the oldest president in U.S. history by the time his term ends in 2029.\n\nHarris also plans to talk up early voting during her rally. Mail-in voting is well underway in the state where some 7 million people are likely to cast votes in the presidential race.\n\nBeforehand, she stopped by a newly opened coffee shop and record store in Erie as she continues to press her case for Black men’s support.\n\nThe visit to LegendErie Records and Coffee House, a Black-owned small business, came after her campaign unveiled a plan earlier Monday to give Black men more economic opportunities and other chances. The campaign is trying to step up outreach to Black men, a key voting bloc that has some Democrats concerned about a possible lack of enthusiasm.\n\nTrump spoke at a town hall Monday in suburban Oaks. Responding to a man who said his dream of homeownership feels out of reach, Trump said regulations make it too expensive to build in some places. He repeated his pledge to increase U.S. oil drilling, which he said would drive down costs, though domestic production is already at record highs.\n\n“We’re going to drill baby drill, we’re going to have so much energy and we’re going to bring prices down,” Trump said.\n\nHe also claimed that government data from crime statistics to jobless numbers is “fake,” alleging the numbers are manipulated to help the incumbent Democrats.\n\nTom Bonanno, who was waiting in line and said he lived in the area, said he believed there was greater enthusiasm for Trump this year than in the former president’s two previous campaigns.\n\n”I’m feeling a shift because the economy affects everyone,” Bonanno said. “It’s not just going to be on, you’re feeling joy or happiness or whatever they’re running on. It’s about the economy once again.”\n\nPennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes, the most of any swing state, have generated the most attention by far from the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns. Including Monday’s scheduled events, they will have made 46 stops in the state, according to Associated Press tracking of the campaigns’ public events.\n\nMichigan, with 33 visits, and Wisconsin, with 29, are the next most-visited states, illustrating how both campaigns are focusing on winning states that had been part of the Democrats’ so-called “blue wall” until Trump emerged as the Republican standard-bearer.\n\nDemocrats have won three straight elections for governor, and both current U.S. senators are Democrats, but the state’s legislature is closely divided.\n\nCindy Sunday, 67, of Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, said she has been disappointed that the Biden administration undid some of Trump’s policies on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n“I don’t care that people say ‘he says things that are off color, and this and that.’ Get over that,” said Sunday, who went to Trump’s rally in Oaks. “There are so many more serious things in life to be upset about. I just don’t go for that.”\n\nScolforo reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Associated Press journalists Tassanee Vejpongsa in Oaks, Pennsylvania, Aamer Madhani in Washington and Jonathan J.

At the state level, the former president holds a one-point advantage in both North Carolina and Pennsylvania, and a substantial five-point lead in Nevada—just outside the four-point margin of error. Harris, on the other hand, holds a slight edge in each of the other four states.\n\nOverall, the latest polls indicate a tightening race heading into the last three weeks of the election, with Harris’s post-nomination bump dwindling heading into the final stretch.\n\nBoth candidates are ramping up their blitzes in swing states this week, with Harris slated to make stops in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Georgia. Her running mate, Minnesota Gov.

She served as the White House director of strategic communications in 2020, following several communication roles during the Trump presidency, but she left weeks after Trump lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden. She has emerged as a Trump critic and testified before the House select committee tasked with investigating the events on and leading up to the January 6 Capitol riot and Trump's alleged involvement in it.A new Pew Research Center poll of registered U.S. voters breaks down voter preferences based on categories of demographics like gender, race and ethnicity and age.The poll, conducted from September 30 to October 6, found that men are more likely to favor Trump than Harris (51 to 43 percent), while women tend to favor Harris (52 to 43 percent). But Harris does better with younger voters. Poll respondents aged 18 to 29 tend to prefer Harris to Trump (57 to 34 percent). On the other hand, white voters are more likely to favor Trump than Harris (55 to 41 percent). Harris does better with Black, Hispanic and Asian voters in the survey.Harris has tried to expand her reach in the past few weeks with a media blitz after being criticized for her lack of interaction with the press. She has appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, The View, Howard Stern's radio show, podcasts such as Call Her Daddy and The Shade Room, local media outlets in swing states and CBS News' 60 Minutes.On Wednesday evening, she will sit down with Fox News' Bret Baier where she will reach a more conservative audience base than she's used to.\"Alyssa, what do you think of Harris sitting down with Fox for an interview in Pennslyvania?\" Tapper asked Griffin on Monday.She replied: \"I think it's smart.

Milley, and he knows it.\n\nIf veterans are a bedrock of Trump’s support, swamp things like Milley are a core constituency for Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump is running against them as much as against her, and veterans are well aware of it — yet they’re with Trump, not the Swamp.\n\nThe top brass long misled America about the war in Afghanistan, which they insisted we were winning, and it was the troops who paid the price.\n\nThe fact that Harris has the backing of Washington’s foreign-policy establishment is for many voters a compelling reason to reject her.\n\nVoters across the swing states trust Trump over Harris in matters of war and peace.\n\nFully 50% of those voters say Trump is better suited to handle the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, with only 39% expressing more confidence in Harris, according to polling by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump holds an even bigger lead when it comes to which candidate battleground voters trust to handle the Israel-Hamas war: 48% say Trump, just 33% say Harris.\n\nEvery year the Biden-Harris administration has delivered a foreign-policy disaster — the lethally botched withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Hamas massacre of more than a thousand Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023 and the extension of the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East throughout 2024.\n\nNo wonder voters in the states most likely to decide the election want Trump’s foreign policy, not more of what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have given us these last four years.\n\nVeterans, in particular, know the cost of failed leadership.\n\nThey’ve paid it before — and if Harris wins, their brothers and sisters in arms will pay it again.\n\nDaniel McCarthy is the editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Review and editor-at-large of The American Conservative.","summary":"Democrats have invested heavily in trying to portray Trump as a leader at odds with America’s men and women in uniform — but veterans themselves never bought the story.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/14/opinion/veterans-reject-medias-anti-trump-narrative-to-harris-cost/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/newspress-collage-by33tg7u4-1728947350745.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1728933072&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-14 23:39:46","author":"Daniel McCarthy","authors":["Daniel McCarthy"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":259693074,"title":"Red alert for Kamala in US election","text":"Both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have secured 48 per cent support, according to the latest NBC News survey.\n\nThe numbers suggest Ms Harris is losing some ground after a brief surge in popularity following the announcement she would be taking the reins from 81-year-old Joe Biden in the Democrats’ push to secure another four years in the White House on November 4.\n\nShe has dropped a point after a high water mark of 49 per cent last month. \n\nMr Trump, on the other hand, has gained momentum and has risen four points from 44 per cent in September.\n\nAs with all tight elections, the end result is largely in the hands of the undecided voters. \n\nAround 4 per cent of respondents remain undecided or express no intention to vote for either candidate, a figure that actually dropped from 7 per cent in the previous survey. \n\n10 per cent say they might change their mind before heading to the polls, meaning Mr Trump and Ms Harris’ campaigns leading into November will be even more important. \n\nMs Harris holds a commanding lead in the Black demographic, with a whopping 84 per cent backing her compared to Trump’s 11 per cent. Nevertheless, the Democrats are aiming to bolster support among Black voters, as seen with former President Barack Obama’s passionate speech on Friday.\n\n Among younger voters aged 18 to 34, Ms Harris leads with 58 per cent to Mr Trump’s 37 per cent. She also enjoys stronger support from white voters with college degrees, leading Mr Trump 55 per cent to 41 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Trump is dominating among rural voters, claiming 72 per cent of their support to Ms Harris’s 23 per cent. He also leads among white voters overall and white voters without tertiary degrees.\n\nAnother significant divide in the poll is along gender lines. 55 per cent of women are backing Ms Harris, while 56 per cent of men support Mr Trump.\n\nAccording to US outlet The Hill, Ms Harris holds a narrow 2.9-point lead nationally, based on aggregated polling data.\n\nThe NBC News poll, conducted from Oct. 4-8, surveyed 1,000 voters and has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.\n\nRealClear polling, meanwhile, has Ms Harris at 49 per cent to Mr Trump’s 47.3 per cent, marking a 1.3 per cent gap.\n\nAs always, polling can only get you so far and the real indication of America’s intentions will only reveal themselves on November 5.\n\nChaos has already been sowed in the months leading up to the election. Multiple assassination attempts on Mr Trump’s life have spurred his follower base on, while Ms Harris’ taking over from President Biden in the race has whisked up some much-needed interest from the left. \n\nTo make matters more tense, intentionally-divisive foreign actors are reportedly muddy the water with a slew of disinformation campaigns online, aiming to whittle away at American resolve and encourage conspiracies about an allegedly fraudulent voting system.\n\nObama backs Harris, smashes Trump\n\nFormer President Barack Obama unleashed sharpest critique yet of Mr Trump, accusing the former president of manipulating the public during moments of crisis.\n\nSpeaking to a packed crowd in Pittsburgh, Mr Obama condemned Mr Trump’s misleading statements regarding the government’s aid response to hurricane-hit areas, among several other criticisms aimed at the 78-year-old.\n\nMr Obama has implored Americans to get behind Ms Harris as the November 5 election looms, telling voters that their decision should be made on the “character” of the candidate as much as their proposed policies.\n\n“The idea of intentionally trying to deceive people in their most desperate and vulnerable moments – my question is, when did that become OK?” Mr Obama asked, referencing Mr Trump’s claims that aid was being withheld from Republican areas or diverted to undocumented immigrants.\n\nBut when the crowd cheered, Mr Obama cut them off.\n\n“I’m not looking for applause right now,” he said.\n\nTaking the opportunity to bolster Harris’ presidential campaign, Mr Obama urged voters to get out and vote.\n\n“Whether this election is making you feel excited or scared … do not just sit back and hope for the best. Get off your couch and vote,” he said.\n\nThroughout his impassioned speech, Mr Obama criticised Mr Trump’s policies, especially his handling of the economy, calling the Republican candidate’s economic success claims “ahistorical nonsense”.\n\n“Yeah, it was pretty good when Trump took office in 2017 – because it was my economy,” Mr Obama said, reminding voters that he had spent eight years cleaning up the financial mess left behind by the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIn a particularly pointed moment, Mr Obama called out Mr Trump’s constant blaming of immigrants for problems in the US, describing his promises to address the issue as “outrageously false or dangerously simple.”\n\nAddressing black male voters, a group that has shown lukewarm support for Mr Harris since she replaced President Biden in the race, Mr Obama urged them to rethink sitting out the election.\n\n“You’re thinking about sitting out… because you think that’s a sign of strength, because that’s what being a man is? Putting women down? That’s not acceptable,” Mr Obama said.\n\nNo group of voters is attracting more attention from the campaigns than the tiny sliver of the electorate that is still undecided.\n\nWhile many people long ago made up their mind between Mr Trump and Ms Harris, a small percentage of the population is still grappling with their choice.\n\nThey will ultimately be the ones that decide the next president of the United States.","summary":"New polls have shown a mighty resurgence for Donald Trump, with analysts still completely in the dark about what the White House will look like in 2025.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/us-election-new-polls-show-donald-trump-resurgence-as-kamala-harris-takes-a-dip/news-story/b954097844ba855eeae66ddfa43718e6?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/af01dc69f77adbb5edaf098661eb6e60","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-14 23:28:25","author":"Alex Blair","authors":["Alex Blair"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.248},{"id":259693880,"title":"Trump Is Big Mad That Fox News Is Interviewing Harris","text":"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, increasingly prone to temper tantrums and outbursts of violent rhetoric as the election nears, railed against his former stomping grounds, Fox News, after the network announced that his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, had agreed to an interview.\n\n While Trump himself has been ducking out of any opportunity to answer hard questions, including a second debate with Harris (he resoundingly lost the first one) and a 60 Minutes interview with CBS, he has spent much of his time and energy hyperfocused on fear-mongering about immigration, repeating his desire to be a “dictator,” and insulting Harris over the amount of media attention she has been getting. Harris, meanwhile, has taken numerous opportunities to speak on a variety of different platforms including interviews with radio host Howard Stern, 60 Minutes, the popular Call Her Daddy podcast hosted by Alex Cooper, and the upcoming Fox News interview with chief political anchor Bret Baier.\n\n Trump raged against Harris, Baier, and the conservative network on social media Monday, and lamented, “Kamala Harris has wisely chosen Bret Baier, of FoxNews, to do a much needed interview, because he is considered to be ‘Fair & Balanced,’ though often very soft to those on the ‘cocktail circuit’ Left.” The former president accused Fox of becoming “so weak and soft on the Democrats, constantly polluting the airwaves with unopposed Kamala Representatives, that it all doesn’t matter anymore.”\n\n Despite Trump’s bitter sentiments about the network, he appeared on Fox News on Sunday for an interview with Maria Bartiromo during which she gave him free rein to spout baseless lies and failed to follow up with him when Trump floated using military forces against U.S. citizens who oppose him on Election Day. Unsurprisingly, Trump praised the Fox host for doing a “beautiful job,” while berating “one-sided, negative Democrats” for calling out his fascist plan.\n\n Harris is set to sit down with Baier on Fox News Wednesday in Pennsylvania during the host’s Special Report at 6 p.m. ET. This will be the Democratic presidential candidate’s first formal interview on the network.\n\n Baier previously interviewed Trump in 2023, during which he asked the former president about his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving the White House. During the televised sit-down, Trump essentially confessed to stealing and sharing top-secret government information post-presidency.

In total, filings showed $35,900 was spent at McDonald’s, meaning the Trump campaign made up for 86 percent of all candidates’ spending at the chain in that time frame.\n\nTrump’s admiration for McDonald’s isn’t new, with two of his former aides revealing his typical meal in a 2017 book: “two Big Macs, two Fillet-O-Fish and a chocolate malt.” The former president also famously ordered McDonald’s to the White House as he welcomed Clemson University’s football team after their win in the College Football Playoff National Championship amid a government shutdown.\n\nBut it wasn’t only Big Macs and McFlurries that Republicans have been chowing down on. The entire GOP operation also spent $200,000 Chick-Fil-A, roughly 20 times more than Democrats, The Post’s analysis found. The Biden-Harris campaign, meanwhile, specifically spent over $7,000 at Panera Bread, topping the list of fast-casual restaurants visited by the Democratic team, according to the outlet.\n\nRepublican campaigns spent 18 times as much as Democrats fast-food restaurants.\n\nDemocrats may not be visiting fast-food joints as often, but it doesn’t mean they don’t want their food quickly. Democrats outspent the GOP by about $80,000 by getting their grub delivered on apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash.\n\nThe Post also found that there was a partisan divide over cuisines. Democrats frequented Mexican, Spanish and Chinese food, while Republicans spent more than twice as much as Democrats on BBQ. \n\nCampaigns on both sides of the aisle seem to equally enjoy Italian, French and, of course, American food.\n\nAll in all, the Post’s analysis looked at a total of 21,000 receipts worth a collective $13 million.\n\nMcDonald’s has been mentioned several times on the campaign trail, with Trump often refusing to believe that Harris worked there.\n\nThe vice president repeatedly mentioned her time working at McDonald’s before her first law job in the 1980s. If elected in November, she’d make history as the first US president to have worked at the fast-food restaurant.\n\nOn August 31, she posted on X: “Two middle-class kids. One, a daughter of Oakland, California, who was raised by a working mother and had a summer job at McDonald’s.”\n\nLater that day, he took to Truth Social to write: “Comrade Kamala Harris lied about working at McDonald’s. SHE NEVER WORKED THERE, they think she’s ‘nuts.’”\n\nWeeks later, he repeated the accusation. “She never worked at McDonalds, it’s a lie,” Trump declared at a California rally. “She said she stood over those french fries when they were being fried, and it was so tough work.”","summary":"Republicans have reportedly spent about 28 times as much as Democrats at McDonald’s","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/mcdonalds-trump-sending-republican-democrats-b2629144.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/02/27/02/GettyImages-1128642136.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/a3CXt8aI-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-14 23:18:42","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.323},{"id":259693416,"title":"Kamala Harris to Give First Fox News Interview on ‘Special Report with Bret Baier’","text":"Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier will interview presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris on Oct. 16 in the battleground state of Pennsylvania where Harris leads presidential opponent Donald Trump by 4 percentage points.

Gavin Newsom celebrated the passage of a new state law that could lower gasoline price spikes by giving regulators the authority to require that California oil refiners store more inventory. Newsom and Democratic lawmakers cast the bill as a solution to high gas prices. With less than 3 weeks until the Nov. 5 election, affordability has become a major political issue and a potential vulnerability for Harris' presidential campaign. \"It's about time we stood up,\" Newsom said after he signed the bill on Monday. \"This is the fourth largest market in the world. This is a big damn deal.\" The newly passed law gives Newsom a win in his political battle with the oil industry, but whether Harris or other Democratic candidates will benefit from the governor's victory remains unclear. Newsom’s law will not immediately lower the cost of gasoline in California. While experts say it could ultimately offer reductions of future price spikes, regulators will have to complete a thorough review process to enact the new controls. Governors in Arizona and Nevada wrote letters warning that the legislation could drive up costs for their constituents, potentially bolstering concerns in pivotal swing states about California's policies. Newsom called lawmakers back to Sacramento for a special session to pass the policy. At the same, however, his administration is expected to adopt stricter limits on carbon fuels that could drive up per gallon costs by almost a half dollar or more just days after the election. The governor declined to answer a question at a press conference about whether he thought the new law would impact Democrats in the election, arguing that the effort wasn't about politics. In a video posted to social media minutes before he signed the bill into law on Monday, Newsom accused the industry of being in \"cahoots\" with Trump by intentionally pushing prices higher to scare voters during election season. Opponents have cast his push to address gas prices as an example of “political theatrics.” “This is politics, not policy,” said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, chief executive of the Western States Petroleum Assn. “This is a show. This is anything but good policy.” Newsom and WSPA have been locked in a political battle over gas prices since the summer of 2022. The governor ran ads in Florida calling out Gov. Ron DeSantis' conservative policies, which prompted a response from WSPA blaming Newsom for California’s highest in the nation gas prices. Since then the governor has repeatedly accused the industry of intentionally gouging consumers. His administration has pointed out that prices spike when refineries experience unplanned maintenance problems with their equipment, which limits the amount of gasoline available in the state and drives up prices. Requiring the refineries to increase fuel reserves, his administration says, will help prevent those shortages. Reheis-Boyd has argued that requiring refineries to store more gasoline will increase costs for the companies and drive up prices at the pump. The industry contends that California’s nation-leading gasoline costs are a supply and demand problem in a state that has adopted environmental policies to limit oil drilling and production. The cheapest way to lower gas prices is to allow oil companies to increase crude oil production in California and rely less on supply from overseas, Reheis-Boyd said. The state should be working closely with California’s small number of refineries to ensure the state has enough gasoline, instead of adopting new regulations that restrict profits and pushing the companies out of business, she said. “We have a governor who isn't interested in the conversation,” Reheis-Boyd said. “He's the only governor I've never met with, because he won't meet.” This year marks the second time in two years that Newsom has pushed lawmakers to adopt new oil regulations, an issue that divides Democrats as they navigate desires to fight climate change and lower gas prices. In 2023, lawmakers balked at passing Newsom's proposal to penalize oil companies that earn excessive profits. Instead lawmakers adopted new oversight of the industry and gave regulators the ability to cap profits through a rule-making process that has yet to result in any new restrictions. Democrats in the Legislature were reluctant to pass Newsom’s new oil bill again this year. Two weeks before the regular session concluded at the end of August, Newsom announced a proposal to require that petroleum refiners maintain a stable inventory in order to prevent fuel shortages and price spikes when refinery equipment is taken offline for maintenance. Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas (D-Hollister) refused to take up the bill for a floor vote at the end of session, arguing that his caucus did not want to rush legislation through without properly vetting the policy. He agreed to work on the proposal in a special session. Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire (D-Healdsburg) took the opposite approach. His caucus was ready to pass the bill at the end of session, he said, and he initially refused to participate in a special session before giving in to the governor’s demands. During the special session, the Assembly held a series of hearings before passing the bill earlier this month. The Senate quickly signed off on the proposal the following week. While some liberal Democrats quietly fumed as the governor forced them to vote on another one of his political proposals, many felt the policy could ultimately reduce price spikes on consumers. \"The data is clear: Price spikes happen when refineries fail to plan for supply during scheduled maintenance,\" said Assembly member Gregg Hart (D-Santa Barbara). \"This bill will hold oil companies accountable for resupply plans when refineries shutdowns occur, ultimately saving Californians billions at the pump.\" Several Democratic legislators competing for swing-district seats in November did not vote, or opposed the bill. State Senator Dave Min (D-Irvine), who declined to vote on the proposal, said he supported the goal to address the problem of high gas prices in the state, but did not agree with the approach. Min is currently locked in a tight race for congress against Republican Scott Baugh in Orange County. Min said opponents to Newsom's proposal \"raised serious concerns\" about whether it would be effective in lowering gas prices or even counterproductive. “These concerns deserve a fair and full vetting, which is difficult to do in a special session conducted just weeks before many of the current legislators will be leaving office,” Min said in a statement. Republicans said Democrats would reduce gas taxes if they were serious about the problem of affordability. “So, who's making the money?” asked state Sen. Brian Dahle (R-Bieber). “Who's gouging Californians for every gallon of gas? It's the government. $1.42 for every single gallon of gas goes to taxes, whether it's state, local or federal.” Opposition to the proposal from labor unions representing workers in the industry added to the pressures on Democrats. Tom Baca, the international vice president for western states of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, said giving regulators control over maintenance schedules, instead of relying on the insight of the workers with deep knowledge of the equipment, could put his members in dangerous conditions if work is delayed. David Sikorski, business manager for the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 12, called the special session “unnecessary.” His union represents 21,000 workers in California, Arizona and Nevada. He said Newsom's policy could prove to be a liability to Harris in the neighboring swing states of Arizona and Nevada. “We've made some real momentum, hit the ground running in Arizona, and we put a lot of resources into getting friendly politicians, and Kamala Harris, elected in that state,\" he said. \"This is just one more hurdle that we have to overcome with our membership and working people in general.”","summary":"Gov.

I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my cabinet who is a Republican.”\n\n“Well, she said it and I agree with her,” Walz told “Smartless” co-hosts Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett. “She needs to appoint a Republican to the cabinet — I do think it matters to her — to a position of authority.”\n\nThe governor of Minnesota mentioned Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, whom he described as “super conservative, but that man is as honest as anything.” In 2019, during the first impeachment of Donald Trump, Flake wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post, in which he stated, “My fellow Republicans, it is time to risk your careers in favor of your principles. Whether you believe the president deserves impeachment, you know he does not deserve reelection.”\n\nWalz also expressed his admiration for Oklahoma Sen. Jim Lankford, who wrote “a big piece” of the immigration bill. “I served with him. That guy is the most conservative person I ever met, but he’s also one of the most honorable. Some of these people need to be put in a position where they truly have the ability to influence things because they are ethical and they care about this country. And I think that’s something that really sets [Harris] apart to make a high profile appointment. Bring them folks who care about the country and let us look.”\n\n“I don’t want to be surrounded by [yes] people — in my organization, my folks know that I’ll say something. They say, ‘You know, with all due respect, governor, that is a horrible idea and we should not do it.’ And I’m like, ‘OK, good.

(AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris announced a plan on Monday to give Black men more economic opportunities and other chances to thrive as she works to energize a key voting bloc that has Democrats concerned about a lack of enthusiasm.\n\nHarris’ plan includes providing forgivable business loans for Black entrepreneurs, creating more apprenticeships and studying sickle cell and other diseases that disproportionately affect African American men.\n\nHarris already has said she supports legalizing marijuana and her plan calls for working to ensure that Black men have opportunities to participate as a “national cannabis industry takes shape.” She also is calling for better regulating cryptocurrency to protect Black men and others who invest in digital assets.\n\nThe vice president’s “opportunity agenda for Black men” is meant to invigorate African American males at a moment when there are fears some may sit out the election rather than vote for Harris or her opponent, Republican former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe vice president unveiled the plan as she visited Erie, Pennsylvania, where she stopped by LegendErie Records and Coffee House, a Black-owned small business, for a conversation with Black men from the area.\n\nThe business, opened just five weeks ago, is the project of Ishmael and Allana Trainor, a married couple and Erie natives who returned to their hometown after living for years in Arizona.\n\nLater, Harris was to hold a campaign rally in the northwest Pennsylvania city.\n\nHer push comes after former President Barack Obama suggested last week that some Black men “aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president.”\n\nThe Harris campaign also has been working to increase support among other male voting blocs, including Hispanics, by founding the group “Hombres con Harris,” Spanish for “Men with Harris.” The latest policy rollout is notable because it comes with the stated purpose of motivating Black men to vote mere weeks before Election Day.\n\nAs her campaign has done with the “Hombres” group, Harris’ team plans to organize gender-specific gatherings. Those include “Black Men Huddle Up” events in battleground states featuring African American male celebrities for things like watch parties for NFL and NCAA football games. The campaign says it also plans new testimonial ads in battleground states that feature local Black male voices.\n\nCedric Richmond, co-chair of the Harris campaign and a former Louisiana congressman who is Black, said Harris wants to build an economy “where Black men are equipped with the tools to thrive: to buy a home, provide for our families, start a business and build wealth.”\n\nBlack Americans strongly supported Joe Biden when he beat Trump in 2020. Harris advisers say they are less worried about losing large percentages of Black male support to the former president than that some will choose not to turn out at all.\n\nTrump, too, has stepped up efforts to win over Black and Hispanic voters of both genders. He has held roundtables with Black entrepreneurs in swing states and will sit for a townhall sponsored by Spanish-language Univision this week. He also has sought to openly stoke racial divisions, repeatedly suggesting that immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally are taking jobs from Black and Hispanic Americans.\n\nHarris’ new round of proposals includes a promise that, if elected, she will help distribute 1 million loans of up to $20,000 that can be fully forgivable to Black entrepreneurs and others who have strong ideas to start businesses. The loans would come via new partnerships between the Small Business Administration and community leaders and banks “with a proven commitment to their communities,” her campaign says.\n\nThe vice president also wants to offer federal incentives to encourage more African American men to train to be teachers, citing statistics that Black males made up only a bit more than 1% of the nation’s public school teaching ranks in 2020-21, according to data from the National Teacher and Principal Survey.\n\nHarris also is pledging to expand existing federal programs that forgive some educational loans for public service to further encourage more Black male teachers. She also wants to use organizations like the National Urban League, local governments and the private sector to expand apprenticeships and credentialing opportunities in Black communities.\n\nThe vice president’s advisers have been urging her to talk more about cryptocurrency as a way to appeal to male voters. Her campaign said that as president, Harris will back a regulatory framework meant to better protect investors in cryptocurrency and other digital assets, which are popular with Black men.\n\nHarris also promised to create a national initiative to better fund efforts to detect, research and combat sickle cell disease, diabetes, prostate cancer, mental health challenges and other health issues that disproportionately affect Black men.\n\nA recent poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found about 7 in 10 Black voters had a favorable view of Harris and preferred her leadership to that of Trump on major policy issues including the economy, health care, abortion, immigration and the war between Israel and Hamas. There was little difference in support for Harris between Black men and Black women.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Harris team pointed to polls showing Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, having made gains in the battleground state’s suburbs — which it dubbed “our own mini ‘blue wall’” in Pennsylvania — compared with President Joe Biden’s 2020 performance there. The campaign also emphasized that a win involves boosting its popularity among educated suburbanites, including those who have voted for Republicans in recent elections. Nearly 160,000 voters in the state cast ballots for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in the GOP presidential primary this year — with her numbers proving stronger among suburban voters — even after she had already dropped out of the race against former President Donald Trump. “The Harris campaign’s path to win Pennsylvania capitalizes on Trump’s unprecedented weakness in the suburbs,” reads the memo, which also highlighted the campaign’s focus on Haley voters. “We have flipped the suburbs from red to blue since Trump won them in 2020, and we have also grown our support with women and tripled our support among white college educated voters in the state.” The campaign cited surveys last month from The Philadelphia Inquirer/The New York Times/Siena College and Marist College that both showed Harris up 6 percentage points over Trump in the suburbs — a notable improvement from Trump’s 3-point victory over Biden among suburban Pennsylvanians in 2020, as exit polls showed. (The results in both of the surveys last month fell within their margins of error.) Recent surveys have found the overall race in Pennsylvania to be within the margin of error for polls, with a survey from Quinnipiac University this month finding Harris up 3 points, an Inquirer/Times/Siena survey finding her up 4 points and The Wall Street Journal having Trump up 1 point. It’s the most sought-after battleground on the map, offering the most Electoral College votes among the hotly contested states, and it is the most frequent campaign destination for both Harris and Trump. Trump’s “weakness in the suburbs means that for him to actually win, he has to double and triple down on his base in the reddest counties in the state,” said Brendan McPhillips, a senior adviser to Harris’ Pennsylvania campaign. “And so we are going on offense and going to places where he thinks he has a strength and competing.” The campaign highlighted events that Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have held in red counties like Johnstown, Lancaster and Rochester. It also detailed investments made in red parts of the state to “cut margins and stop Trump’s only hope of victory,” noting that 16 of its 50 statewide campaign offices are in counties Trump won by more than 10 points in 2020. Recent presidential elections in Pennsylvania have been exceptionally close. Biden defeated Trump in 2020 by just over 1 point. In 2016, Trump beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by an even slimmer margin. “With most polls showing this to be a margin of error race, we are also going on offense with rural voters to cut into Trump’s margins — a critical advantage as Trump’s team lacks the ground game capacity to conduct persuasion and mobilization campaigns simultaneously,” the Harris campaign memo reads. McPhillips said improving on Biden’s margins in those counties by just 1 to 2 points would effectively cut off Trump’s path to flipping the state red. “We’re eating into his margins in a way that cannot sustain a victory,” he said. “And that is how we’re going to beat him, and it’s how we’re able to play offense on so many fronts.” The campaign highlighted that as of Sunday it had knocked on more than 1 million doors across the state, including 250,000 over the weekend, since Harris replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket. It also referred to its 50 offices and 450 on-the-ground staff members. Harris has so far spent far more time in the western part of the state, including rural areas, than she has in the Philadelphia market, which McPhillips said is partly to help introduce her to voters who may be less familiar with her. For Trump, billionaire mogul Elon Musk ramped up his political engagement in the state this month through his America PAC, which is working to turn out the vote for Trump. McPhillips dismissed the potential impact of that effort. “They can’t scale up to the level that we’re at,” he said. “Even with Elon Musk’s money, you can’t spend enough money to scale up an operation to match ours. It’s too late. You needed to start in March, February, January, and they’ve just been phoning it in for so long. It’s going to be close, for sure. We’ve always been planning for it to be so. But that planning manifests itself in the fact that we actually had a plan, not a concept of one.” The Trump campaign said the Harris campaign is papering over a problem it faces in Pennsylvania cities — particularly Philadelphia, the most vote-rich locale for Democrats in the state. “They can point to the suburbs, but they’re losing ground in places like Philadelphia,” a Trump campaign official said. “It’s exactly why [former President Barack] Obama was just pleading to African American men to vote for her. They’ve sounded the alarms, and they know they’re losing.” The Trump campaign also pointed to Republicans’ having significantly cut into the Democratic voter registration advantage in the state while flipping Bucks, Luzerne and Beaver counties to Republican registration edges. It further highlighted reports that working-class voters in Philadelphia have embraced Trump. Kush Desai, the Trump campaign’s Pennsylvania spokesperson, highlighted Obama’s visit as a sign the Harris team was scrambling. “An Obama visit isn’t going to convince Pennsylvanians to vote for another four years of open borders, rising prices, and disaster at home and abroad,” Desai said in a statement. In its memo, the Harris campaign said it believes it will be able to “at least match” Biden’s support in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia in his victory in those cities four years ago. It went into greater detail about its efforts to reach Black voters in the state, including the staff members it has dedicated to outreach and engagement and its events focused on Black voters. Last week, Obama offered unscripted remarks during a Pittsburgh campaign stop in which he said his understanding of the race is that “we have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running. … [T]hat seems to be more pronounced with the brothers.” Seeking to speak directly to Black men, he pushed for undecideds to get behind Harris, saying her record deserves their support. “This is excellence on display, and it needs to be rewarded,” Obama said. State Sen. Vincent Hughes told NBC News he could “understand the frustration” Obama expressed. “Maybe the tone should have been a little bit different,” he said. “But let’s be real clear about this. Let’s get to the substance of what he said. There’s nothing in Donald Trump’s background, career, anything that should lead any citizen, let alone Black men, to vote for him. He’s not a successful businessman. … He was sued for discrimination in housing.” Hughes said the Harris campaign is going to hit its targets among both Black men and voters in Philadelphia, adding that he has seen a flood of campaign activity there recently that has outpaced what Democrats were doing in 2020 during the worst of the Covid pandemic. “It’s going in the right way for the vice president,” he said. “Look, for a woman and for a Black woman, it’s always harder. It’s not fair, it’s not right, but it’s always harder. Maybe if we break through with this election, we can finally smash that glass ceiling and not make it so hard for the next one.”","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign laid out what it sees as her path to victory in Pennsylvania in a memo ahead of Monday night’s rally in bellwether Erie County.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-sees-path-victory-pennsylvania-running-suburbs-rcna175307","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-09/240926-harris-walz-ch-1049-f3ecc0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-14 22:57:58","author":"Allan Smith","authors":["Allan Smith"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.012},{"id":259691212,"title":"Idina Menzel Channels ‘Adele Dazeem’ Frustration Into PSA on How to Pronounce Kamala Harris’ Name","text":"Idina Menzel has experienced more than her fair share of people mispronouncing her name — but she’s drawing the line when it comes to Kamala Harris.\n\n With Election Day less than a month away, the Broadway alum issued a video PSA via Instagram on Sunday demonstrating the exact way to say the VP’s moniker. “You have to get the pronunciation of Kamala Harris correct,” she says in the clip, standing outside while addressing the camera. “It’s getting really exhausting.

Officials have said that this countermeasure could lead to substantial expenses, including legal fees and overtime pay for staff. The mounting costs have led some to worry that the fines may fall short of covering the town's financial burden.This issue has also raised questions about free speech and the limitations of displaying political messages on public property, a topic likely to spark further debate as the presidential election approaches.This is not the first time a sign promoting a presidential nominee has caused controversy. Last week, a 100-foot-wide, 12-foot-tall glowing \"VOTE FOR TRUMP\" sign was seen in Amsterdam, New York.The sign, erected atop the headquarters of Sticker Mule, a sticker and T-shirt printing company based in the small upstate city, has become a flashpoint in a national debate over partisan politics, free speech, and the more byzantine matter of local zoning codes.Sticker Mule unveiled the Trump sign at a lighting ceremony last week that went ahead despite the town's concerns that it was against code and would pose a distraction to passing motorists.Sticker Mule's CEO, Anthony Constantino, a Trump supporter, said the sign is a matter of free speech and unity.However, Amsterdam's mayor, Michael Cinquanti, a Democrat, says he just wants the company to abide by the law, arguing the sign violates a city code that states a sign on top of a business must relate to the business it is underneath.The city of Amsterdam, about 35 miles northwest of Albany, filed a lawsuit against Sticker Mule last week in the state Supreme Court, reiterating this argument.\"We're asking him to comply with city codes. Everybody hates negative publicity in the city, and that's what I was trying to avoid,\" Cinquanti previously told Newsweek, adding that he did not want City Hall's issue with the Trump sign turning into a political powder keg.This article includes reporting from The Associated Press.","summary":"The town of Hanson, Massachusetts, has imposed a $100 daily fine until the display is halted.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/massachusetts-town-fines-resident-projected-trump-2024-water-tower-1968963","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2495162/donald-trump-campaign-sign.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-14 22:44:47","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.261},{"id":259691466,"title":"Idina Menzel Channels ‘Adele Dazeem’ Frustration Into PSA on How to Pronounce Kamala Harris’ Name","text":"Idina Menzel has experienced more than her fair share of people mispronouncing her name — but she’s drawing the line when it comes to Kamala Harris.\n\n With Election Day less than a month away, the Broadway alum issued a video PSA via Instagram on Sunday demonstrating the exact way to say the VP’s moniker. “You have to get the pronunciation of Kamala Harris correct,” she says in the clip, standing outside while addressing the camera. “It’s getting really exhausting. It’s Kamala, like a comma. ‘Comma-la.'”\n\n “I tend to be an expert on pronunciations of names, since mine is always screwed up, as you know,” Menzel continued, before referencing one of the most viral moments of her career: when John Travolta butchered her name while introducing her performance at the 2014 Oscars.\n\n “And not just as ‘Adele Dazeem,'” the Frozen star says. “People call me Indiana, ‘Eye-dina’ … I was just at an event in Oklahoma, and they called me ‘Ay-deena Menzul.'”\n\n Though Menzel says people are constantly mispronouncing her name, Travolta’s flub is definitely the most memorable. Though he’d later say that a last-second change to the teleprompter was to blame, he mistakenly set up her performance of “Let It Go” by saying, “Please welcome the wickedly talented, one and only Adele Dazeem.”\n\n At the time, Menzel took it in stride and, at the next year’s ceremony, got the Grease actor back by referring to him as “Glom Gazingo” as the two presented onstage. Earlier this year, the Rent performer celebrated the viral moment’s 10-year anniversary with a funny TikTok, telling the camera: “Hey, Adele Dazeem! It’s Idina Menzel … I just wanted to say happy birthday. Sending you so much love and positive energy.”\n\n When it comes to Harris, however, Menzel isn’t joking around. At the end of her PSA, the star adds, “I think that the vice president and soon-to-be president should have her name pronounced correctly.”\n\n Watch Menzel’s tutorial on how to say Kamala Harris’ name below.","summary":"\"It's getting really exhausting,\" the Broadway alum says of rampant mispronunciations of the VP's moniker.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/idina-menzel-kamala-harris-name-pronunciation-psa-1235800441/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Idina-Menzel-june-2024-tony-awards-a-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-14 22:44:34","author":"Hannah Dailey","authors":["Hannah Dailey"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.068},{"id":259690808,"title":"Bill Clinton got it right: Harris, Biden’s broken border led to Laken Riley’s murder","text":"We don’t agree with Democrats often, but Bill Clinton truly nailed it Monday when he admitted Laken Riley’s murder “probably wouldn’t have happened” if migrants had “all been properly vetted.”\n\nBubba was supposedly stumping for Kamala Harris, trying to defend her horrific record as border czar, when he accidentally told the truth.\n\nThe 22-year-old Georgia student’s accused killer, Jose Ibarra, had crossed into the United States illegally in 2022 and got promptly released into the interior. \n\nClinton tried to shift blame to Donald Trump, who he claimed is responsible for killing that “bipartisan border bill” that Democrats insist would’ve fixed everything. \n\nOops: Ibarra was set free in 2022 (when Democrats controlled Congress), while that bill didn’t even surface until this year.\n\nAnd of course Trump as president set up numerous safeguards to keep illegal migrants like Ibarra out of the country.\n\nEven those “seeking asylum” had to wait in Mexico until their cases could be heard, under Trump’s Migrant Protection Protocols.\n\nYet from the moment President Biden and Border Czar Kamala Harris took office, they scrapped every last protection Trump erected, including the Remain in Mexico program.\n\nAlmost anyone requesting asylum — no matter how bogus the ask or frightening their criminal background (or terror ties) — gets in, virtually no questions asked.\n\nIndeed, along with violent criminals, Harris-Biden policies have let in thousands of illegal migrants from countries that are hotbeds of terrorism.

And even so, Americans would want migrants fully vetted to prevent killers like Riley’s from entering.\n\nClinton made one other notable admission: that Harris failed at her main border job — getting countries to steer their migrants into a “legal process” so they wouldn’t get in if they “weren’t properly vetted.”\n\nRight, again, Bill — though he (pathetically) blamed “traffickers” who “made a lot of money” for that failure.\n\nThe Harris campaign has pulled out the Democratic Party luminaries to make the case for her, but first Barack Obama and now Bill Clinton have failed: Maybe there’s just no good argument to make?","summary":"Bill Clinton nailed it Monday when he admitted Laken Riley’s murder “probably wouldn’t have happened” if not for the broken border under Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, which fails to ensure that all migrants are “properly vetted” and criminals kept out.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/14/opinion/bill-clintons-right-harris-bidens-broken-border-led-to-laken-rileys-death/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/newspress-collage-64xsgv1kp-1728945314917.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1728930989&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-14 22:41:08","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.763},{"id":259690806,"title":"Michigan Dem who panders to LGBT community ‘special guest’ of bishop with history of homophobia","text":"ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Democrat Kristen McDonald Rivet, who’s flaunted her pro-LGBT stance through social-media posts of herself at pride parades, is joining a Monday get-out-the-vote rally hosted by a bishop who’s come under fire for his anti-gay remarks. \n\nMcDonald Rivet, a Michigan state senator vying for a congressional seat, is a “special guest” of Pentecostal Bishop Christopher E.

I said they should have never hired him. He’s gay. They should have voted him out. He’s been gay. He was gay when they hired him. He was gay when you all fired him.”\n\n“A man pastoring you ought to be married to a woman. There ought to be a first lady somewhere.

In the resurfaced sermon, Martin declared pastors must “love” their parishioners out of homosexuality.\n\n“How you gonna preach to them and you got it [homosexuality]?” said Martin. “We trying to get people out of what they’re in.

They will vote to shape public policy on topics including abortion, LGBTQ+ rights, crime and how elections are run in their states.There will be two types of initiatives on voters' ballots this year regarding elections. Several states will consider moving to a ranked-choice system, while others are considering cracking down on municipalities permitting noncitizens to vote in local elections.This map shows which states are considering changes to their voting rules.What Is Ranked-Choice Voting?The following states will be voting on ballot measures that would establish ranked-choice voting: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and South Dakota.Ranked-choice voting allows voters to \"rank\" candidates based on their preferred order. After all votes are counted, if no candidate reaches 50 percent, the candidate who received the lowest number of votes is eliminated. Then, votes are re-tabulated, with the votes of anyone who ranked that candidate first going to their second choice. That continues until a candidate reaches 50 percent.Most of these states are also considering a shift to a nonpartisan primary system for state and federal races, which would have one primary for all candidates, with the top candidates, the exact number of which depending on the state, advancing to the general election.California and Washington use nonpartisan primaries, also known as \"jungle primaries.\"Maine also uses ranked-choice voting, though it employs a more traditional partisan primary system. Dozens of municipalities across the country also use ranked-choice voting in local elections.Alaska voters will vote on an initiative that would repeal the state's ranked-choice system. Voters in Missouri will also consider a measure that would bar the use of ranked-choice voting in the state.Citizenship Requirement on the BallotIdaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin are voting on ballot measures that would prohibit local governments from allowing noncitizens to vote in elections.It is illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, but a handful of municipalities allow them to vote in local elections. Those areas include a handful of towns and cities in Maryland and Vermont, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.Notably, they can only vote in local—not state or federal—elections. This means they will not be able to cast a ballot in the presidential race.None of those states are considering ballot measures that would bar municipalities from letting noncitizens vote in their elections.While noncitizens do illegally register to vote from time to time, there is no evidence of this being a widespread issue that has led to any substantial changes in electoral outcomes. States frequently remove noncitizens from their voter rolls.","summary":"Ranked-choice voting and citizenship requirements for local races are among the ballot questions voters face in November.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/map-shows-states-voting-ballot-measures-election-1968946","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2495134/voting-ballot-measure-map.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-14 22:36:23","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.168},{"id":259690418,"title":"Doug Emhoff Reviews His ‘SNL’ Impersonators: “The Group Chats Blow Up”","text":"Doug Emhoff weighed in on his various Saturday Night Live impersonators this week, answering the ultimate question: Martin Short or Andy Samberg? \n\n “Martin Short is way older and shorter, but he actually got me,” Emhoff told Gavin Newsom, Marshawn Lynch and Doug Hendrickson on the Politickin’ podcast. “Samberg — it’s good, it’s funny.

This initiative, called the \"Opportunity Agenda for Black men,\" aims to solidify a crucial voting bloc aheadof the presidential election, where recent polls show a decline in support for Democrats, according to USA Today.Forgivable loans Harris' proposals include offering one million \"fully forgivable\" loans to Black business owners, designed to help those who lack the necessary resources and connections to launch their enterprises. The loans, which can reach up to $20,000, will be administered through a new partnership with the Small Business Administration.Marijuana legalisationAdditionally, Harris called for national legalisation of marijuana for recreational use, aiming to ensure that Black entrepreneurs gain access to the cannabis industry. Her campaign said, \"Kamala Harris will fight to ensure, as the national cannabis industry takes shape, Black men – who have, for years, been over-policed for marijuana use – are able to access wealth and jobs in this new market.\" This move is very different from how the previous administration handled things. President Joe Biden's team has recently worked to change marijuana's classification from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug.Addressing voter concernsThe unveiling of these policies comes as the Harris campaign faces pressure from within, particularly as former President Donald Trump gains traction among Black male voters. Recent polls indicate that Harris leads Trump by a margin of 78%-15% among Black voters, a significant drop from the 90% support Biden received in 2020.Harris will discuss her economic agenda at a Black-owned business in Erie, Pennsylvania, before a campaign rally later in the evening. Former President Barack Obama also weighed in, urging Black men to rally behind Harris, noting that some hesitation comes from her being a woman.Protecting cryptocurrency investors and expanding educationHarris' agenda includes regulations for cryptocurrency to safeguard investors. The campaign highlighted that more than 20% of Black Americans own or have owned cryptocurrency assets, signalling the importance of this measure.Harris also aims to expand education and mentorship opportunities for Black men.

While many older adults are highly functional, age can also come with cognitive changes that affect our ability to function well in complex settings,” the letter stated.\n\n“We are seeing that from Trump, as he uses his rallies and appearances to ramble, meander, and crudely lash out at his many perceived grievances. He also is notably refusing to give the public the ability to properly vet or scrutinize his capacities.”\n\nLast week, Trump backed out of an interview with 60 Minutes and has refused to debate Harris for a second time, following his poor performance on September 10. The experts highlighted the former president’s wild and debunked claim that Haitian migrants in Ohio were eating neighborhood pets.\n\n“In the limited opportunities we can examine his behavior, he’s providing a deeply concerning snapshot. Given his advancing age – if elected again, he would be the oldest president in history by the end of his term – his refusal to disclose even basic health information is a disservice to the American people,” the letter stated.\n\n“The stakes of this election are historically high. Vice President Harris and her campaign have provided the transparency that we should expect from our leaders and confirmed her wellbeing and fitness to serve. Voters deserve to know that Trump is up to the job. That’s why we are asking Donald Trump to release his medical records, just as Harris has done.”\n\nThe letter was reposted by the Harris campaign’s official account on X. The account also posted a clip where Trump says that his people are “going crazy” during an interview. The Harris campaign ended the clip before Trump could continue.\n\nAt a rally on Sunday, Trump doubled down on his own mental acuity telling supporters he was not cognitively impaired. “I’ll be the first to let you know,” he said.\n\n“I’m up here ranting and raving – last night, 100,000 people, flawless ranting and raving. I’m ranting and raving, not a mistake, and then I’ll be at a little thing, and I’ll say something a little bit [wrong] they’ll say, he’s cognitively impaired.\n\n“No… I will be someday. We all will be someday, but I’ll be the first to let you know.”\n\nMental capacity was also one of Trump’s favorite attack lines against his former political rival Joe Biden, before the president dropped out of the 2024 race.\n\nAt Sunday’s rally, moments after assuring supporters he was mentally sound, Trump referred to Biden as “obviously cognitively repaired,” rather than “cognitively impaired.”","summary":"An open letter to the former president, signed by over 230 medical professionals, noted that he was ‘displaying alarming characteristics of declining acuity’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-harris-medical-records-doctors-b2629175.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/14/16/SEI225561132.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/fuN5U5gM-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-14 22:18:47","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":259690324,"title":"Trump ‘crossed a line’ by saying army should be used against his enemies, Walz says – live","text":"Kamala Harris will this evening seek to portray Donald Trump as a potential tyrant-in-waiting who wants to jail his political opponents by seizing on his threat to use US armed forces against those he has branded “the enemy within”.\n\nThe US vice-president and Democratic nominee will hone in on the former president’s darkening campaign rhetoric at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, widely deemed the most crucial battleground state in a presidential race that multiple polls suggest will go down to the wire.\n\nAt the same time, Harris’s campaign is releasing a new campaign advert, titled The Enemy Within, featuring some of Trump’s recent ominous comments about his adversaries and warnings from two former members of his presidential administration about the danger he would pose if elected president again.\n\nThe 30-second video, complete with footage of Trump walking in front of a row of helmeted riot officers and showing troops on the street during his presidency, tries to concentrate voters’ minds with contributions from Olivia Troye, a one-time national security adviser to Mike Pence, and Kevin Carroll, a former senior counsel in the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n“I do remember the day that he suggested that we shoot people on the streets,” Troye says in the ad, which is accompanied with a dramatic musical soundtrack.\n\nCarroll adds: “A second term will be worse.

She will appear on Fox News on Wednesday for an interview with Bret Baier, the network's chief political anchor, though Carville does not see these moves as favorable.\"She's obviously working hard,\" Carville said. \"I'm not a fan of doing interviews with different people because the problem with the interview is you have to answer questions that the interviewer asks you.\"Instead, Carville suggested that the vice president needs to be on the offensive about former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee.\"We need to stop being timid in making these connections that he is going out of his way to make,\" Carville said. \"I think what Trump is saying now is unprecedented and I'm afraid that people just don't know how—I don't know if radical is the word—the things he really is proposing. She has to put a light on this, a big shining light.\"Newsweek has reached out to Harris' campaign via email for comment.Carville focused on how Trump has said he would use the military or National Guard to \"round up\" his domestic enemies.Trump has suggested that an \"enemy from within\" could threaten Election Day security, telling Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday that \"if necessary\" the National Guard or military may have to intervene, which sparked alarm online.Ian Sams, a spokesperson for Harris' campaign, released a statement on Sunday in a campaign email: \"Donald Trump is suggesting that his fellow Americans are worse 'enemies' than foreign adversaries, and he is saying he would use the military against them. This should alarm every American who cares about their freedom and security. What Donald Trump is promising is dangerous, and returning him to office is simply a risk Americans cannot afford.\"Steven Cheung, Trump's campaign spokesperson, told Newsweek in an email Sunday night that \"Trump is 100% correct—those who seek to undermine democracy by sowing chaos in our elections are a direct threat, just like the terrorist from Afghanistan that was arrested for plotting multiple attacks on Election Day within the United States.\"Trump has previously threatened to prosecute his perceived political enemies, including Harris, President Joe Biden and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat.In an interview appearance last week with Fox News' Laura Ingraham, Trump was asked about restoring faith in the justice system, with Ingraham noting the concerns of his critics that he'll use the courts to get back at his opponents, \"Punitively using government institutions is what got us in this mess in the first place.\"Trump replied: \"They've started a terrible precedent. We've never had this.\"Carville told CNN on Monday that the use of the \"US military to round up domestic enemies is about as anti-Constitutional as anything you can think of.\"Newsweek has reached out to Trump's campaign via email for comment.Harris' campaign noted that at her rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, on Monday night, the vice president will \"ratchet up warnings about the risk a second Donald Trump term poses to the American people if he returns to power, pointing to his increasingly unhinged and dangerous rhetoric at his rallies calling his fellow Americans 'the enemy from within.'\"The campaign released a new ad tilted \"Enemy Within\" that features Trump's former national security aides Olivia Troye and Kevin Carroll, warning against a second term for the former president.\"The second term would be worse,\" Caroll says in the ad. \"There will be no one to stop his worst instincts. Unchecked power. No guardrails.\"Carville also noted that Trump's power is also evident within the rally he is set to hold in Madison Square Garden in New York City, which will \"mimic a rally held on February 20, 1939, by the American Nazi Party.\"\"Where do normal people campaign on October 27 before Election Day? They're generally in places like Sheboygan [Wisconsin] and Flagstone [Georgia] and Reno [Nevada],\" Carville said. \"He's going full throated authoritarianism...He's going to say, Michael Flynn is going to say, we told you so and you voted for us so we have no choice but to arrest our political enemies. He's stating it right in our face.\"Even still, Carville said he refuses \"to believe we're going to lose.\" It's not a thought in his mind anymore, he said, but people need to know \"what exact is at risk here.\"Carville said he did agree with David Plouffe, a former Obama aide who now works as a senior adviser to the Harris campaign. Plouffe said on Pod Save America that the Democratic nominee's lead is \"not real\" because it is \"basically a tied race in seven states.\"According to pollster Nate Silver, Harris' chances of beating Trump in November, however, have plunged in recent weeks. Silver's October 14 forecast showed that her chances of winning the Electoral College had plummeted to 51.8 percent—dropping by about 6 percentage points since late September.\"What's going to happen is if he wins the election, he will be in the position to say I told you all of this. I have the authority of the election behind me to round up my political enemies,\" Carville said. \"Somehow or another we're not getting that word out. This is a very dangerous time if you think about it.\"","summary":"The vice president's media blitz may not be helping her this close to Election Day, the Democratic political strategist said.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/james-carville-donald-trump-enemies-military-election-1968948","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2495140/james-carville-donald-trump-kamala-harris.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-14 22:15:51","author":"Monica Sager","authors":["Monica Sager"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.299},{"id":259689288,"title":"Election betting: Appeals court fast-tracks CFTC challenge to Kalshi political bets","text":"A federal appeals court has fast-tracked the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s case challenging the right of the event exchange Kalshi to offer U.S. political election contracts.\n\nThe expedited appeal comes as Kalshi and another platform, Interactive Brokers, are offering an array of political contracts, including bets on the outcomes of the U.S. presidential election, U.S. Senate races, and party control of each chamber of Congress.\n\nKalshi touted its presidential election contracts on electronic signs in New York City’s Times Square over the weekend.\n\nThe quick appellate schedule calls for the CFTC to file its legal brief by Wednesday and for Kalshi to respond with its brief by Nov. 15 — 10 days after Election Day.

This is especially evident among Latinos, as shown by mock elections in the state’s majority-Hispanic public schools, in which former President Donald Trump got 18% of voters in 2020 and 35% so far this year.\n\nThese changes are not going to make California go Republican on Nov. 3, but they’re part of a nationwide Republican trend among so-called minorities that may help Trump carry several target states with large percentages of Hispanics (Arizona and Nevada) and blacks (Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, and Pennsylvania).\n\nDefinitive confirmation of what has been scattered evidence comes from the latest, very highly rated New York Times/Siena poll, which oversampled Hispanics and blacks. The outlet’s chief political analyst, Nate Cohn, reported last weekend that Trump is trailing Vice President Kamala Harris by 78-15% among blacks and by only 56-37% among Hispanics. Trump, Cohn said, “might well return to the White House by faring better among black and Hispanic voters than any Republican presidential nominee since the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964.”\n\nThis not only alarms but also puzzles many Democrats. Commenters responded in disbelief to Madrid’s post. \n\n“I cannot think of 1 single thing that Trump has or will do for Latinos,” said Lisa Grande. \n\n“Specifically why?” asked DebJM. “GOP has no policy that benefits either group. In fact, they stigmatized all the groups mentioned.” \n\nSome users were not just condescending but insulting. \n\n“It’s nothing new that many Latinos are dumb like a rock when it comes to their own interests,” said FrankFromGermany.\n\nSomething similar came from as exalted and successful a political analyst as former President Barack Obama. Speaking in Pittsburgh last Thursday, the former president, who won 365 and 332 electoral votes (of 538) in 2008 and 2012, upbraided black voters, especially men. \n\n“Part of it makes me think — and I’m speaking to men directly,” he said, “that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president.”\n\nSimilar to a jazz artist improvising on a theme, Obama continued, “Women in our lives have been getting our backs this entire time. … And now, you’re thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you because you think that’s a sign of strength because that’s what being a man is? Putting women down? That’s not acceptable.”\n\nIt’s not generally considered good persuasion tactics to accuse voters of bigotry and insist they confess error, but Obama seemed to be appealing to a longtime theme in black politics. Any reporter who’s watched a Democratic candidate speak in black churches has heard preachers call for unity. The virtual unanimity of black voters over many years, for Republicans from 1865 to the 1930s and for Democrats since 1964, is a rational response by voters who are conscious of being part of a discriminated against minority and who want to maximize their political clout.\n\nThat seems natural in a party that historically has always been a coalition of out-groups in a diverse society, minorities who, taken together, can form a national majority. Thus, the commenters on Madrid’s post are puzzled that Hispanics and blacks might vote for a Republican Party that, in their view, offers them no policies addressing their specific plight.\n\nThey might be less puzzled if they hit their New York Times app and read Cohn’s analysis. He points out that nearly half of Hispanic and black voters support a southern border wall and deportation of illegal immigrants. About half of minorities, similar to half of whites, say big city crime is out of control. Majorities of blacks and Hispanics favor an “American first” foreign policy.\n\nMoreover, under 30% of blacks and Hispanics rate the economy positively, and 61% of Hispanics and 25% of blacks, for whom the economy is the most important concern, favor Trump. As the Democratic Party becomes dominated by left-wing woke progressives and more liberal white college graduates, attitudes rooted in history that had prompted blacks and Hispanics to vote near-unanimously or heavily Democratic have been thrust aside.\n\nNear-majorities of Hispanics and substantial numbers of blacks have become, in Ruy Teixeira’s, a liberal patriot writer, phrase, “normie voters.” Just as in their daily lives, I suspect, they live similarly to normie Americans. The rigid and often violently imposed regime of segregation and subordination described in anthropologist John Dollard’s 1938 Caste and Class in a Southern Town has been long gone, and increasingly, though not completely, black Americans go about working, shopping, and enjoying leisure activities without stigma or disrespect.\n\nAs for Hispanics, to whom civil rights protections were applied in the 1970s on the assumption they would be treated similarly to segregation-era Southern blacks, that assumption was never accurate, and the cessation of Mexican immigration for a decade after the housing and financial crisis of 2007-08 provided time for assimilation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER \n\nLet us go back to where this column started: California. I see a historical analogy. Just as the largely midwestern migration there in 1940-65 led to Democratic victories and then, in response to the Watts riot and Berkeley rebellions, the 1966 turn to the conservatism of former President Ronald Reagan, the largely Mexican migration in 1982-2007 led to Democratic victories and now, in response to the Biden inflation, illegal immigration, and COVID-19 lockdowns, we’re seeing a 2024 movement toward the populism of Trump.\n\nIf the Democratic Party has always been a coalition of outgroups, when members of an outgroup start feeling like normies, they may turn to the Republicans, who have always been centered on a core group of people regarded as typical Americans. While this process goes on, we may see the two parties in very close balance.","summary":"Not everything significant politically is happening just in the target states. “Never seen anything like this in over thirty years,&#8221; said California Republican consultant Mike Madrid in an X post, referencing the sharp increase in Republican registration among California’s minority voters, including the state&#8217;s numerous Latinos, growing numbers of Asians, and decreasing number of blacks.

JD Vance again refused to acknowledge that Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election. \n\nThat refusal is a foundation of the former president’s so-called “Big Lie,” that the election was somehow stolen from him. Dozens of courts, Trump’s own departments of Justice and Homeland Security, and some Republican officials have rejected the baseless claim. \n\nThe “Big Lie” is blamed as a contributing factor to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot that sought to thwart the certification of President Joe Biden’s election victory. \n\nVance, Trump’s vice-presidential running mate, refused during his debate with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to acknowledge that Trump lost the election. \n\nIn his interview with Lulu Garcia-Navarro of The New York Times, Vance ducked the question five more times. He said the focus on 2020 is an obsession, that he and Trump are looking forward and trying to instead draw attention to his claims that censorship by big technology companies cost Trump millions of votes. \n\nA story, initially published by the New York Post, referenced emails on a laptop owned by Hunter Biden that it said discussed overseas business dealings. Critics of the president argue, without conclusive proof, that shows corruption. Some social media companies took down references to the story, arguing that it could be Russian disinformation. \n\n“Did big technology companies censor a story that independent studies have suggested would have cost Trump millions of votes?” Vance said in response to the third time Garcia-Navarro asked the question. \n\n“Senator Vance, I’m going to ask you again,” Garcia-Navarro said a fourth time. “Did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election?” \n\n“I’ve answered your question with another question,” Vance said. “You answer my question, and I’ll answer yours.” \n\nTrump recently has continued to preach the “Big Lie” on the campaign stump, saying the election in 2020 was rigged and that he really won in a landslide. He blames fraud by mail-in voting, by noncitizen voting, by a vast interstate conspiracy and fraud orchestrated by the Democratic Party. \n\nYet, governors from all 50 states certified their 2020 election results. Election officials and outside experts praised the election, with more votes cast for president than ever before, as one of most secure and accurate ever. And when Trump sought to contest the results in court, he lost more than 60 times. \n\nTrump’s rhetoric, though, is often cited as a potential cause of rioting at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Speaking at a rally beforehand, Trump urged the crowd to march to the Capitol to get Republicans to oppose certification of the electoral count. \n\n“If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” he said then. \n\nAfter Vance refused to answer her question directly, Garcia-Navarro said “there is no proof, legal or otherwise, that Donald Trump did not lose the 2020 election.” Vance then cut her off. \n\n“You’re repeating a slogan rather than engaging with what I am saying, which is that when our own technology firms engage in industrial scale censorship, by the way backed up by the federal government, in a way that independent studies suggest affect the votes, I’m worried about Americans who feel like there were problems in 2020,” Vance said. “I’m not worried about this slogan that people throw, ‘Well, every court case went this way.’ I’m talking about something very discrete: A problem of censorship in this country that I do think affected things in 2020, and more importantly that led to Kamala Harris’ governance, which has screwed this country up in a big way.” \n\nWhile he would not answer Garcia-Navarro’s question about who won the election directly, Vance insisted he and Trump would support a peaceful transfer of power. \n\nVance previously has said he would not have certified the 2020 election results, as Trump’s then-Vice President Mike Pence did. The U.S. Constitution does not empower the vice president to reject electors submitted by states, as Vance has said he would have requested if he had presided over the certification. \n\nAs rioters overran the Capitol to stop the certification, they chanted “hang Mike Pence.” A White House aide later testified to Congress that Trump said Pence “deserves” it. \n\nSee more JD Vance in the news stories.\n\nCleveland.com is closely tracking JD Vance’s every move and the reactions he provokes, as he becomes the first Ohioan in 80 years to appear on a presidential ticket for either major party.

During a 23-minute sit-down with Black-focused entertainment outlet \"The Shade Room\" on Monday, Harris was asked about polls indicating that the Democrats' advantage with Black voters may be declining from past presidential cycles, and among Black men in particular. According to a New York Times/Siena College poll released on Saturday, Harris currently holds 78% of the Black vote, which is down from 2020, when President Biden won approximately 90% of that voting bloc. It's also down from 2016, when Hillary Clinton won approximately 92% of the Black vote. Harris' support among Black men has dropped even more significantly, according to the report: 70% said they would vote for Harris in November, down from Biden’s 85% in 2020. \"When you hear those numbers, and you're seeing in the polls — Black men aren't as excited or fired up for you, how do you respond to that?\" host Justin Carter asked Harris. CNN DATA REPORTER PREDICTS TRUMP WILL WIN ‘HISTORIC’ NUMBER OF BLACK AND HISPANIC VOTERS The VP immediately dismissed the polls and suggested that things could change in the next three weeks before the November election. \"One, that's not my experience,\" Harris responded. \"Two, Election Day has not arrived yet.\" Harris went on to say that she is not taking these voters for granted and is working to earn their support. \"Black men are no different from anybody else. They expect that you have to earn their vote. And that's why I'm out here,\" she continued. \"It's incumbent on me to earn their support, that’s why I’m talking to folks about the work I’ve done in my career,\" she said, citing her efforts to help strengthen small businesses and pledging to continue to do so if elected as president. HERSCHEL WALKER SAYS OBAMA ‘FORGOT OUR FIGHT FOR RIGHT TO VOTE’ AFTER SCOLDING BLACK VOTERS AGAINST HARRIS Later in the interview, Harris was asked whether former President Obama was \"right\" to scold Black men during a campaign stop for Harris last week, suggesting sexism played a role in their lack of enthusiasm for the female presidential candidate. \"I'm very proud to have his support,\" Harris said, before urging listeners to take heed to Obama's warning about what's at stake in this election if her opponent, former President Trump, were to be re-elected. On Monday, Harris rolled out a new agenda aimed at helping boost Black men's financial prospects, called the \"Opportunity Agenda for Black Men.\" The proposals include providing 1 million loans that are fully forgivable to Black entrepreneurs and others to start a business, championing education, training and mentorship programs that help Black men get good-paying jobs in high-demand industries and lead their communities, including pathways to become teachers. On Tuesday, Harris will continue her outreach to Black voters, NPR reported, by taking questions at a town hall moderated by popular Black radio host, Charlamagne tha God. CNN data reporter Harry Enten predicted on Monday that Trump could win a \"historic\" share of Black and Hispanic voters this election. \"At this particular hour, if you believe the polling, Donald Trump’s going to put up the best performance with Black voters since Richard Nixon in the 1960s,\" Enten said.

It's designed to try to get us off our game,” Emhoff explained, saying the stakes were far too high to worry about the swill Trump pumps out on a daily basis.\n\n\"What kind of future are we going to have?” Emhoff continued. “Who would you like picking the next two or three Supreme Court justices? The guy who picked the three who overturned Roe v. Wade, and want to take away more and more freedom? Or do you want Kamala Harris picking those Supreme Court justices?”\n\nEmhoff has been an excellent surrogate for his wife, championing the need for women’s rights especially.\n\nEmhoff says he and Harris are “deferring that kind of happy couple time” because the finish line and the stakes are clear. “So all that other stuff you're talking about bounces off.

We are seeing that from Trump, as he uses his rallies and appearances to ramble, meander, and crudely lash out at his many perceived grievances.\"\n\nThe letter then names some of the conspiracy theories that Trump has invented, like the immigrants eating people's pets and FEMA withholding aid to those in North Carolina. The healthcare professionals say, \"his refusal to disclose even basic health information is a disservice to the American people.\"\n\nWhen speaking to CNN in 2019, former Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-NE) requested that Trump prove he has bone spurs, which is the reason he got out of fighting in Vietnam. Bone spurs don't go away, he explained.

I’ll tell you what it is.”\n\nAfter sharing a clip of Cranston endorsing the vice president at a “Fighting for Reproductive Freedom” event over the weekend, Kelly continued, “[He] really wants to make sure his grandchildren can be aborted.”\n\nGeting to her personal connection, Kelly added, “The reason I don’t like Bryan Cranston is because a dear friend of mine was one of this guy’s closest friends for decades. And Bryan Cranston dumped my friend as his friend because he’s a Republican and voted for Trump.”\n\n“He’s not even like a huge Republican,” the conservative host continued. “He’s a Republican… he’s a right-leaning guy, but he ended their lifelong friendship just because he turned out to be a Trump supporter. That is so vile and so disgusting and is right on brand with what we just heard there.”\n\nAt the event over the weekend, Cranston said, “I am not a politician. I am not a doctor or a lawyer, but I played all of those on TV. But I am a father of a daughter, and it’s important to me for her life now, for the future other father’s daughters to be able to have within their lifetime the fundamental right, freedom of choice.”\n\nCranston continued, “There should not be anyone but them deciding what happens to their own body. That’s why I’m enthusiastically supporting Vice President Harris and Governor Walz.”\n\nThe actor has remained politically outspoken against Donald Trump for years – including last year when he explained to CNN’s Chris Wallace that the “Make America Great Again” slogan could be perceived as a “racist remark” given how things have changed over the years when it comes to non-white people having more rights over the years in this country.\n\nWatch the full Megyn Kelly clip above.","summary":"He “dumped my friend as his friend because he’s a Republican and voted for Trump,” the conservative host explains, following the actor's Kamala Harris endorsement\n\n\nThe post Megyn Kelly Shares Why She Hates Bryan Cranston: It’s ‘Personal’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/megyn-kelly-hates-bryan-cranston-kamala-harris/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MegynKellyBryanCranston.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-14 21:49:44","author":"Jacob Bryant","authors":["Jacob Bryant"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.192}]}
