ABC moderator David Muir immediately fact-checked him, claiming, “President Trump, as you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is coming down in this country … ”\n\nNearly every major media outlet echoed that narrative. National Public Radio ran the headline “Violent crime is dropping fast in the U.S.—even if Americans don’t believe it.” The Wall Street Journal declared, “Violent Crime Rate Falls Sharply After Pandemic Surge.” Vox insisted, “Violent crime is plummeting.” Axios reported, “New data shows violent crime dropping sharply in major U.S. cities.”\n\nHowever, a new Bureau of Justice Statistics report, which includes data through 2024, shows that Trump was right during the debate when he said, “Crime here is up and through the roof.” The National Crime Victimization Survey shows violent crime surged 59%, with rape and sexual assault up 67%, robbery up 38%, and aggravated assault up 62%. That’s the largest four-year increase in the survey’s 52-year history.\n\nThe contrast with Trump’s first term is stark. The National Crime Victimization Survey data shows that between 2017 and 2020, violent crime fell 15%, including a 6% drop in robbery and a 24% decline in aggravated assault. Although rape and sexual assault rose slightly, the increase was less than 10% of what occurred under former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe federal government tracks crime in two main ways. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports count the number of offenses reported to police each year. The Bureau of Justice Statistics’ National Crime Victimization Survey, by contrast, annually asks about 240,000 people living in the United States whether they were crime victims. The latter method captures both reported and unreported incidents.\n\nLast year, the media focused almost entirely on the FBI data.\n\nBefore 2020, the FBI and the Bureau of Justice Statistics trends generally moved in tandem. Since then, they’ve diverged sharply: The FBI reports fewer crimes, while more Americans say they’ve been victimized. Unreported crime was always a factor—and the reasons for it vary. They range from people reluctant to report being victimized by loved ones to a simple aversion by undocumented people to involve themselves with the criminal justice system.\n\nIn recent years, however, another factor appears to have skewed the FBI data: the breakdown of law enforcement in this country. When people believe police won’t catch or prosecutors won’t punish criminals, they’re simply less likely to report crimes. Between 2010 and 2019, victims reported 63.3% of violent crimes to police. In the last three years, that number plummeted to 48.8%. Arrests fell as well—from 26.5% before COVID-19 to just 16.6% afterward.\n\nOther factors also distort the FBI data. Many big-city police departments, such as D.C., have reclassified serious offenses, apparently in an effort to make the streets seem safer than they are. Downgrading aggravated assaults to simple assaults removes them from the FBI’s violent crime statistics, for example. Whether an attack counts as “aggravated” often depends on whether a weapon was used—but many progressive district attorneys now refuse to pursue weapons charges. That difference matters because the NCVS asks victims directly whether a weapon was involved, even if police reports omit it.\n\nProgressive prosecutors in cities like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles have also made a habit of reducing felony charges. In Manhattan, for example, the district attorney’s office downgraded felonies 60% of the time—with 89% downgraded to misdemeanors and 11% to less serious felonies. Chicago has labeled some murders as “death investigations” rather than homicides. These practices appear to be spreading, and police may now be adjusting their own reports to reflect prosecutors’ leniency.\n\nThe latest federal data expose a stark reality: Violent crime has surged dramatically despite claims to the contrary. The growing gap between reported crimes and actual victimization reflects both a breakdown in law enforcement and the deliberate downgrading of offenses by progressive prosecutors. Until the justice system restores accountability and accurate reporting, Americans will continue to face rising violence that the FBI’s official statistics fail to capture.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Maura Healey has led the state.\n\nTens of thousands packed Boston Common, holding signs with messages of disapproval of President Trump, while similar scenes played out at over 100 other protests in Massachusetts. Demonstrations unfolded nationwide.\n\nTrump defeated Democrat Kamala Harris in last November’s presidential election, winning the popular vote, 49.8% to 48.3%. He also garnered 312 electoral votes.\n\nMayor Michelle Wu headlined the protest at the Common, reminding the progressive crowd that “every voice is heard” in Boston, which she called the “cradle of liberty” for the past 250 years.\n\nThe mayor said the city stands with Los Angeles and Portland, Ore., where Trump has tried to deploy the National Guard to combat what the president has described as lawlessness.\n\n“Boston embodies the truth that America is a nation of immigrants and laws,” Wu told to a roar of cheers. “Our city is proof that both make us stronger. Boston will keep fighting back to keep moving forward.”\n\nAt the beginning of Wu’s speech, a couple of protesters, equipped with a megaphone and holding Palestinian flags, tried to disrupt the mayor’s comments. After a few moments, police officers ordered them to back away from the front row.\n\nThe nonviolent protest at the Common on Saturday took place after last week’s pro-Palestinian rally in which protesters assaulted Boston Police officers, one of whom suffered a broken nose that required reconstructive surgery.\n\nEvent organizers had a team of “security” volunteers who were dispersed throughout the massive crowd, wearing orange vests. The emcee of the rally, Rahsaan Hall, CEO of Urban League of Eastern Mass., joked around about how one of the speakers at the event would be the executive director of Antifa.\n\nAhead of the “No Kings” protests, Republican gubernatorial candidate Mike Kennealy made a social media post in which he highlighted actions under Gov. Healey that he has described as harmful.\n\nKennealy started the post with, “As citizens around Massachusetts are protesting on ‘No Kings Day,’ consider this:”\n\n“There’s a politician who stood by while migrant children were raped and abused in government-run facilities,” the GOP candidate stated. “A politician who appointed their ex-partner to be a powerful judge. … A politician who has threatened and defunded cities and towns for not following top-down edicts.”\n\n“I’m of course referring to our Governor Maura Healey,” Kenneally concluded.\n\nHealey did not attend the protest at the Common. This past week, she told reporters she wasn’t sure whether she’d be stopping by due to her schedule.\n\nWhile thousands focused on the federal government at the rally, at least one woman seemed more concentrated on calling out how Attorney General Andrea Campbell has refused to enforce the legislative audit that state voters approved last November.\n\nCampbell, addressing the crowd in Boston, championed how she has filed 40 lawsuits against the Trump administration since the president’s inauguration last January.\n\nThe AG received a 12%, or $9 million, budget increase this fiscal year, bringing her office’s total allocation to $83 million, to support its fight against Trump.\n\n“In America, we don’t have kings, we have ‘the people,’” Campbell told protesters. “They (the feds) will keep on coming and we will keep on fighting … If they come for Massachusetts, I say, bring it on.”","summary":"Thousands of Bay Staters protested the Trump administration across the Commonwealth on “No Kings Day,” as a leading Republican gubernatorial candidate told residents to consider how Gov.

Speaking to his audience on HBO’s \"Real Time,\" Maher acknowledged that Trump accomplished something many thought might be impossible. \"I think you’ve gotta give credit where credit is due. I mean, a lot of people tried to pull this off. He did,\" Maher said Friday. Earlier this month, the White House finalized an agreement between Israel and Hamas to end years of conflict in Gaza. It was a deal Trump and his team helped broker. BILL MAHER BLASTS ‘KEFFIYEH-WEARING COLLEGE KIDS’ FOR SILENCE AS HAMAS SLAUGHTERS PALESTINIANS IN GAZA Maher, a frequent critic of Trump, praised the president’s success with his usual dry humor. \"After two years, the Palestinians are returning to Palestine, the hostages are coming back to Israel, and everyone’s blown away that Trump pulled it off,\" Maher said.

I mean, if there’s one thing he’s good at, it’s sending people back where they came from,\" the host joked. His quip referred to Trump’s latest push to deport illegal immigrants convicted of crimes out of the United States.

While in the throes of divorcing his first wife, the television presenter and lawyer Kimberly Guilfoyle, it emerged he had had a brief affair with his appointments secretary, who also happened to be married to his then-campaign manager. It was a juicy national scandal but his career survived after he made a frank admission in a press conference, taking full responsibility: “I want to make it clear that everything you’ve heard and read is true.”\n\nHe married again in 2008 to Jennifer Siebel, an actress and film director, with whom he has four children (Montana, Hunter, Brooklynn and Dutch). She is designated California’s “first partner”. Guilfoyle, meanwhile, went on to date Donald Trump Jr: small world.\n\nNewsom briefly considered running for governor of California in 2009 but, facing strong opposition from the popular Jerry Brown, settled to run instead as Brown’s understudy in the largely lame-duck role of lieutenant governor. He had some minor progressive successes, helping to tighten gun controls and to legalise marijuana, but was probably best known during this tenure for designating the avocado as the state’s official fruit (he claims to eat several a week).\n\nThis week he banned the sale of Glock pistols and made it easier for high-school students to access further education.\n\nAs Brown reached the end of his last possible term (he’d served four; today, California mandates a maximum of two, like the presidency), Newsom ran for governor in 2018 and was elected in a landslide.\n\nHis campaign had been helped along the way by significant donations from San Francisco royalty including the Pritzkers, descended from founders of the Hyatt Hotel chain; the Fishers, founders of the Gap clothing brand; and, unsurprisingly, the Getty family.\n\nIn 2018, after auditing donations to Newsom’s various campaigns in the lead-up to the election for governor, the Los Angeles Times concluded he was “the product of a selection process in which some of the wealthiest families in the entire country have been involved from his earliest engagement in politics.”\n\nAs governor, Newsom has passed numerous progressive bills, such as requiring public colleges to offer abortion medications, banning smoking in state parks and on beaches, banning the sale of petrol-powered cars from 2035 and mandating that large retailers can no longer offer customers just “boy” and “girl” sections for toys but must have a “gender-neutral” section too. This week he banned the sale of Glock pistols (a popular brand of handgun) and made it easier for high-school students to access further education.\n\nHe has come under criticism for California’s homelessness epidemic, soaring house prices and a particularly sharp cost-of-living crisis. And there was a misstep in 2020 when he dined mask-free at the French Laundry, a high-end restaurant, in defiance of COVID recommendations; it added fuel to a campaign to have him unseated, which he survived.\n\nWhat are Newsom’s chances of becoming president?\n\nIt’s early days in the 2028 presidential campaign, if one yet exists. But Newsom’s willingness to take on Trump has had many pundits suggesting he has presidential ambitions and has flipped the switch on a shadow campaign.\n\nUntil recently, Newsom was seen as keen to mediate between left and right, playing something of a peacemaker. In January, he initially greeted Trump on friendly terms when the president flew out to discuss support after wildfires devastated Los Angeles County, meeting him at the airport and declaring: “We welcome President Trump to California with an open hand.”\n\nSurprisingly for a Democrat, Newsom has also reached out to several right-wing pundits to appear on his podcast, among them Charlie Kirk.\n\n‘Come after me. Arrest me. Let’s just get it over with, tough guy.’\n\nRelations with Trump’s MAGA acolytes deteriorated dramatically, however, in early June when Trump sent the National Guard and 700 Marines into Los Angeles to bolster a federal crackdown on undocumented immigrants. “Border tsar” Tom Homan made the extraordinary threat to have Newsom arrested for defying Trump’s orders. “His primary crime is running for governor because he’s done such a bad job,” said Trump. Newsom responded: “Come after me. Arrest me. Let’s just get it over with, tough guy.”\n\nThis level of friction is almost unprecedented, says Natasha Lindstaedt, a professor of government from the University of Essex. “We have rarely had a president getting into fights with governors,” she says. “They usually need to work together and have a strong working relationship.”\n\nSince then, it’s been a war of words that has given Newsom a national profile and, in a political system that, unlike Australia, has no formal leader of the opposition, elevated him to the unofficial role of the Democrats’ head of the resistance. “Democrats are unable to have any impact in Congress,” Dafydd Townley tells us from the University of Portsmouth. “Any resistance comes from the states themselves, and Newsom has assumed that leadership.”\n\nThe timing might suit a presidential run. Newsom’s final term as governor ends in 2027, which would give him clear air to tour the nation and raise the millions he would need in donations to run a successful national campaign.\n\n“On the negative side, he’ll have to push even harder to maintain the press coverage that he’s currently getting,” says Townley. “But at the same time he’ll likely be able to avoid any persistent targeting by Trump, unless the administration believes him to be the major candidate for 2028.”\n\n‘Don’t rule out Michelle Obama being on a ticket somewhere.’\n\nAlso in his favour: few, if any, possible rivals have the same name recognition. Perhaps Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Pete Buttigieg, who served in Joe Biden’s cabinet as transportation secretary. Other, lesser-known, hopefuls to be touted include Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer; Illinois governor JB Pritzker; Maryland governor Wes Moore; Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro; and Senator Cory Booker from New Jersey. Meanwhile, “don’t rule out Michelle Obama being on a ticket somewhere,” says Townley. Then there’s Kamala Harris, who has said she won’t run for California governor but hasn’t ruled out another presidential campaign.\n\nNot so much in Newsom’s favour: he’s a white, straight male in a party that might prefer a more diverse candidate; his links to old money might alienate working-class voters. Tim Lynch, who is a professor of American politics, describes him electorally as a “target-rich environment”.\n\n‘I do think he is going to try to run, and has been positioning himself as the person that is best to beat Trump.’\n\nThen there’s the hurdle that liberal California, seen by many Americans as quite separate from the rest of the country, has yet to produce a Democratic president (the one it did chalk up was Ronald Reagan, a Republican).\n\n“It’s very difficult to see how a California Democrat is going to be any more electable than the last one to try, which was Kamala Harris,” says Lynch. “Democrats in California generally represent everything that even mild Trump supporters set themselves against. I don’t think Newsom is the most ‘woke’. But I think the caricature the ordinary middle-of-the-road voters have is that California is an empire of the woke and trans rights and Hollywood leftism.”\n\nNatasha Lindstaedt agrees. “I don’t see him as a viable candidate,” she says, though she adds: “I do think he is going to try to run, and has been positioning himself as the person that is best to beat Trump.”\n\nNewsom may also hit a roadblock within his own party, says Townley. “The most difficult opposition might be the far left within his own party who might state he’s not liberal enough. Will the left of the party, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example, be willing to support him if he doesn’t align with her agenda?” Of note, Newsom believes trans women should not compete in sport with biological women, defying a view widely held on the left. (Trans rights advocates have said they are sickened by his position.)\n\nIn the governor’s immediate future is a piece of California legislation that could yet cement him as the Democrat frontrunner. Ahead of next year’s mid-term elections, some Republican states, notably Texas, have been redrawing their congressional district boundaries to win more Republican seats.\n\n‘He can easily raise money. He could catapult to office if he wins this referendum.’\n\nIn response, Newsom is holding a ballot next month asking Californians to do the same for Democrats, temporarily changing his state’s districts to deliver his party five more seats in 2028, offsetting their losses in Texas. Nancy Pelosi has been assisting in his campaign to win what is technically known as Proposition 50, or the Election Rigging Response Act.\n\nFor Newsom to achieve this would change the political landscape in a meaningful way, says Bruce Wolpe. “If he wins that and California enacts it, that would be a big win for him. He becomes the giant-killer for the Democratic Party.” If Newsom is successful, “he will be the guy who did the most, more than anyone in Congress, to do something to stop Trump. He has all the time. He can easily raise money. He could catapult to office if he wins this referendum.”\n\nAnd if the ballot fails? “This is a very important election for him,” says Wolpe. “He’s a popular governor. If he can’t persuade his own state to support him on something so important, like the future of the country, why should he be the presidential nominee?\n\nExplainers are brought to you by The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald Explainer team: editor Felicity Lewis and reporters Jackson Graham and Angus Holland.

Will the left of the party, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example, be willing to support him if he doesn’t align with her agenda?” Of note, Newsom believes trans women should not compete in sport with biological women, defying a view widely held on the left. (Trans rights advocates have said they are sickened by his position.)\n\nIn the governor’s immediate future is a piece of California legislation that could yet cement him as the Democrat frontrunner. Ahead of next year’s mid-term elections, some Republican states, notably Texas, have been redrawing their congressional district boundaries to win more Republican seats.\n\n‘He can easily raise money. He could catapult to office if he wins this referendum.’\n\nIn response, Newsom is holding a ballot next month asking Californians to do the same for Democrats, temporarily changing his state’s districts to deliver his party five more seats in 2028, offsetting their losses in Texas. Nancy Pelosi has been assisting in his campaign to win what is technically known as Proposition 50, or the Election Rigging Response Act.\n\nFor Newsom to achieve this would change the political landscape in a meaningful way, says Bruce Wolpe. “If he wins that and California enacts it, that would be a big win for him. He becomes the giant-killer for the Democratic Party.” If Newsom is successful, “he will be the guy who did the most, more than anyone in Congress, to do something to stop Trump. He has all the time. He can easily raise money. He could catapult to office if he wins this referendum.”\n\nAnd if the ballot fails? “This is a very important election for him,” says Wolpe. “He’s a popular governor. If he can’t persuade his own state to support him on something so important, like the future of the country, why should he be the presidential nominee?\n\nExplainers are brought to you by The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald Explainer team: editor Felicity Lewis and reporters Jackson Graham and Angus Holland.

It's my firm belief that our city makes the most progress when we all work together in a spirit of partnership. I remain deeply grateful to Mayor [Daniel] Lurie, SFPD, and all our partners, and am fully committed to a safer, stronger San Francisco.\"\n\nThe Trump administration already has deployed the National Guard to Portland, Ore.; Memphis, Tenn., and Chicago in a crackdown on illegal immigration and crime. Lower courts blocked the deployments of the troops.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump told in the Oval Office that \"we have great support in San Francisco\" for sending troops to the city, apparently a reference to Benioff. He urged FBI Director Kash Patel to make San Francisco \"next\" for deployment.\n\nBenioff's suggestion was condemned by politicians, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, investors and those associated with the company.\n\nNewsom, who was mayor of San Francisco, is a friend of Benioff and appeared at last year's company convention.\n\nMore than 180 Salesforce workers, alumni and community members wrote an open letter on Friday that was published online. They said his comments have \"revealed a troubling hypocrisy.\"\n\n\"Salesforce was built on empowering communities -- not deploying the National Guard into them,\" they wrote. \"Last week, that's exactly what you endorsed.'\n\nThe letter added: \"Walking back your words doesn't undo the damage.\"\n\nStartup investor Ron Conway resigned from the board of the Salesforce Foundation on Thursday. Conway told Benioff in an email that their \"values were no longer aligned,\" according to the New York Times.\n\nConway donated around $500,000 to at least two funds tied to Kamala Harris' unsuccessful 2024 presidential election campaign.\n\nBenioff has donated to both political parties but has supported Harris, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for president. He attended a state dinner by King Charles for Trump at Windsor Castle in England on Sept. 15.\n\nHis family and Salesforce have given more than $1 billion to Bay Area causes, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\n\nBenioff, who acquired Time magazine in 2018, has a net worth of $8.8 billion, ranking 381st in the world, according to Forbes.\n\nLaurene Powell Jobs, a pre-eminent philanthropist, criticized Benioff for his remarks.\n\n\"When wealth becomes a substitute for participation, giving is reduced to performance art -- proof of virtue, a way to appear magnanimous while still demanding ownership,\" she wrote in the Wall Street Journal. \"That's the quiet corruption corroding modern philanthropy: the ability to give as a license to impose one's will. It's a kind of moral laundering, where so-called benevolence masks self-interest.\"\n\nConservatives have rallied behind the Salesforce CEO.\n\nVenture capitalist David Sacks, who is now Trump's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, wrote on X : \"Dear Marc @Benioff, if the Democrats don't want you, we would be happy for you to join our team. \"Cancel culture is over, and we are the inclusive party.\"\n\nBenioff has previously complained about crime in the city. In 2023, he threatened to relocate Dreamforce to Las Vegas over concerns about drug use, crime and homelessness.\n\nSalesforce has attempted to get on the good side of the Trump administration as the company seeks regulatory approval for its proposed $8 billion acquisition of Informatica, an AI-powered cloud data management company.\n\nSalesforce a few weeks ago announced a new line of business, Missionforce, for more revenue from defense, intelligence and aerospace agencies.\n\nThe New York Times also reported that Salesforce has offered its services to increase Immigration and Customs Enforcement's capabilities.\n\nSalesforce is a cloud-based software company founded in 1999 by Benioff, a former Oracle executive.\n\nThe company has a market capitalization of $238 billion with $38 billion in revenue in 2025 and 76,453 employees.

Senior Democrats are treating Saturday’s demonstrations as a show of strength and are urging participants to be peaceful amid fears disorder could be used to justify an administration crackdown.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nOver 3,000 demonstrations have been organized as part of “No Kings” on Saturday, which organizers say were called to show that “America has no kings, and the power belongs to the people.”\n\nThe demonstrations have been condemned by senior Republicans including Johnson, who shared an image on X indicating the “Communist Party USA” was supporting the “No Kings” rally in New York City.\n\n“Now we know Saturday’s events are actually funded by Soros, and sponsored by the Communist Party USA, among other far Left and communist groups. How could there any more appropriate nickname than the ‘Hate America Rally?'” he wrote.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has endorsed the demonstrations, leading Representative Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, to write on X: “Nothing says ‘we care about democracy’ like showing up to a rally sponsored by communists. Chuck Schumer is desperately trying to appease the far Left crowd of his party to cling to his leadership role before AOC [Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] inevitably replaces him.”\n\nAccording to CNN, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy claimed the “No Kings” demonstrations were “part of Antifa,” a loose antifascist coalition that Trump recently designated as a terrorist organization. The outlet also quoted Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as claiming the demonstrations would contain the “most unhinged in the Democratic Party.” \n\nThe demonstrations have been welcomed by senior Democrats, with former Vice President and 2024 presidential candidate Kamala Harris on Friday commenting via X: “In our country, the power is with the people. Tomorrow, October 18, I encourage you to join your neighbors in peaceful protest at a No Kings event.”\n\nDemonstrators take part in a protest against the Trump administration during the “No Kings” national rally in downtown Los Angeles on June 14. (Photo by RINGO CHIU/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nConservative commentator Laura Loomer, a Trump ally, wrote on X on Friday: “No Kings protesters were testing their massive ‘Impeach Trump Again’ sign on the National Mall today with life sized puppets of Donald Trump, JD Vance, [Secretary] Kristi Noem and Stephen Miller in chains. The radical left’s message is clear: ‘Get Trump and his supporters at all costs.’”\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer posted to X: “Today’s No Kings rallies are an affirmation of what America is all about. We are a democracy. We have no kings, despite the fact that Trump has even said he wants to become one.”\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democratic Party, wrote on X on Friday: “I am looking forward to joining millions of Americans across the country at a ‘No Kings’ rally tomorrow. I’ll be speaking here in Washington, DC. I hope to see you there.”\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom wrote on X: “I urge our nation to use this weekend’s No Kings marches as a declaration of independence against the tyranny and lawlessness currently running this country. Use your voice. ACT PEACEFULLY. Protect yourself and your community. THERE ARE NO KINGS IN THE UNITED STATES.” \n\nOn its website, “No Kings” states: “The president thinks his rule is absolute. But in America, we don’t have kings and we won’t back down against chaos, corruption, and cruelty. Our peaceful movement is only getting bigger and bigger. ‘NO KINGS’ is more than just a slogan; it is the foundation our nation was built upon. Born in the streets, shouted by millions, carried on posters and chants, it echoes from city blocks to rural town squares, uniting people across this country to fight dictatorship together.”\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nThe size of Saturday’s demonstrations will impact the strength of the message sent to the White House.

Some critics said their support of Palestinians blurred the line between anti-war activism and open support for Hamas.

I just want affordable for my income.”\n\nHere she is thinking she needs special treatment because of her low income, and then voting Republican despite that. Bad move, Chrissy.\n\nLet’s head down to Florida, where insurance agent Alan Reynolds’ family is about to get walloped. \n\n“The loss of his wife’s subsidy means she is likely to pay about $1,200 or more each month, up from about $500 in 2024,” reported The Washington Post.\n\n“I voted for Trump,” Reynolds said. “I didn’t expect this.”\n\nWhy, oh why, wouldn’t he expect this? Trump literally promised to get rid of the Affordable Care Act—without even a proposal for an alternative beyond “a concept of a plan.”\n\nThe irony, of course, is that this mess is disproportionately hitting Republican voters in Republican states.\n\nAt least two polls show that MAGA overwhelmingly supports keeping the ACA subsidies, which proves how deluded they are. If they want the government to help them out, they should be Democrats.\n\nIn Idaho, retired schoolteacher Bob McMichael is going to lose his and his partner’s health care. \n\n“A few years after they retired, but before they were eligible for Medicare, McMichael, 63, and his wife, 62, got the cheapest plan they could find on the marketplace. It had monthly premiums of about $1,800, but Obamacare subsidies kept their monthly payments to about $50 a month,” reported the Idaho Statesman.\n\nIf that happens, McMichael and his wife plan to drop their coverage. He hopes they’ll find a cheaper plan, but he’s not optimistic. The plan they chose last year was the most affordable option, “other than not to have health care.”\n\nMcMichael taught in tiny Council, Idaho—the county seat of Adams County, which voted for Trump 76% to 21%. None of the stories featuring him (and there are several) indicate who he voted for, and as a teacher, there’s a nonzero chance he was one of the 21% who backed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. \n\nBut regardless of his own vote, the fact is that thanks to his neighbors, Idaho will be particularly hard-hit by the potential loss of subsidies.\n\nMcMichael might be one of the good ones—and now he’s collateral damage from his neighbors’ self-destructive efforts to deny themselves quality health care.\n\nRelated | GOP still at the 'ideas' stage of magically fixing health care\n\nThese are people who now will have to weigh whether to buy groceries or see a doctor, or to even entertain the idea of coverage at all.\n\nAnd people will die.\n\nIt’s an opening for Democrats to rebuild public trust around an economic populist agenda that centers on affordability and cost-of-living issues. It won’t reach everyone—the MAGA cult is resilient and deep. But peel away 5–10% of the Republican vote, activate some nonvoters, and it’s a whole different story.","summary":"The stories are starting to flood in of Donald Trump voters realizing in horror that when you vote for the guy who promised to gut the Affordable Care Act with no replacement plan in sight, you might lose your health insurance.

Some lawmakers are predicting it could become the longest, surpassing the 35 days from President Donald Trump's first term. The Trump administration is using the current shutdown to buttress priorities it favors while seeking to dismantle those it doesn't. Nevertheless, Democrats are insisting that any funding bill include help for millions of Americans who will lose health insurance coverage or face dramatically higher monthly premiums if Congress does nothing. The shutdown began Oct. 1. Here's a look at its impact so far on workers, the economy and the services the government provides. Furloughs and firings The federal government employed nearly 2.3 million civilian employees as of March 31. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that about 750,000 of those employees would be furloughed each day during a shutdown. That means they don't report to work until the shutdown ends. Others are considered \"excepted\" and do go to work, helping to protect life and property and perform other essential services. Both groups of workers will get paid, but on a retroactive basis. That means they are facing the prospect of missing a full paycheck later this month after receiving a partial one earlier for work performed in late September. Live Events The nation's 1.3 million active-duty service members got a temporary reprieve. They were looking at missing a paycheck on Wednesday. But Trump directed the Pentagon to redirect money. A second reprieve looks unlikely. Of note for taxpayers, the government tab for paying furloughed workers while they are at home comes to roughly $400 million a day, according to a CBO estimate provided at the request of Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa. The administration is also trying to fire thousands of federal workers in agencies that don't align with its priorities. Republican leaders in Congress have said that's part of the fallout from a shutdown. Past presidents, however, did not use shutdowns to engage in mass firings. The Republican administration has announced one reduction in force affecting 4,100 workers, with the biggest cuts happening at the departments of Treasury, Health and Human Services, Education and Housing and Urban Development. White House budget chief Russ Vought said in an interview on \"The Charlie Kirk Show\" that many more are planned. \"I think we'll probably end up being north of 10,000,\" Vought said. \"We want to be very aggressive where we can be in shuttering the bureaucracy,\" Vought said. \"Not just the funding, but the bureaucracy, that we now have an opportunity to do that.\" A federal judge has temporarily blocked the firings, saying the cuts appeared to be politically motivated and were being carried out without much thought. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that the administration was \"100%\" confident that it will prevail on the merits in subsequent legal action. Lawmakers acknowledge that many federal workers live paycheck to paycheck and will face some financial stress during the shutdown. Food banks in some communities have boosted efforts to help them. The Capital Area Food Bank, for example, said it would hold additional food distributions in the Washington region beginning Monday to support federal workers and contractors. Economic Impact Past shutdowns have had slight impacts on the economy, reducing growth in the quarter during which the shutdown occurs, but growth increases slightly in the following three months to help make up for it. One estimate from Oxford Economics said a shutdown reduces economic growth by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points per week. A shutdown that lasts the entire quarter, which has never occurred, would reduce growth for those three months by 1.2 to 2.4 percentage points. Some industries are hurt worse than others. The U.S. Travel Association said the travel economy is expected to lose $1 billion a week as travelers change plans to visit national parks, historic sites and the nation's capital, where many facilities such as Smithsonian Institution museums and the National Zoo are now closed to visitors. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce noted that the Small Business Administration supports loans totaling about $860 million a week for 1,600 small businesses. Those programs close to new loans during the shutdown. The shutdown also has halted the issuance and renewal of flood insurance policies, delaying mortgage closings and real estate transactions. The Federal Aviation Administration has reported air controller shortages in cities across the United States, from airports in Boston and Philadelphia, to control centers in Atlanta and Houston. Flight delays have spread to airports in Nashville, Tennessee, Dallas, Newark, New Jersey and more. Political fallout The party that insists on conditions as part of a government funding bill generally doesn't get its way. That was the case in 2013 and 2018 for Republicans. It remains to be seen how things will shake out this time, but neither side appears to be budging. So far, the public is rather split on who is to blame for the impasse. Roughly 6 in 10 U.S. adults say Trump and Republicans in Congress have \"a great deal\" or \"quite a bit\" of responsibility for the shutdown, while 54% say the same about Democrats in Congress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Perceptions could change depending upon how much the White House uses the shutdown to eliminate Democratic priorities and Democratic-leaning states and cities. The administration has put on hold roughly $18 billion to fund a new rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River between New York City and New Jersey and an extension of the city's Second Avenue subway. It canceled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year's presidential election. The administration cited reasons apart from the shutdown for the funding changes. In the end, there does not appear to be an easy way out of the shutdown. Republicans insists any negotiations on health care occur after the government is fully open for business. \"We're not conducting negotiations in a hostage situation,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. Across the Capitol, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said Democrats \"are not going to bend and we're not going to break because we are standing up for the American people.\"Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onwhite housetrumpcongresshousetreasurysmithsonian institutionsmall business administrationoxford economicshousing and urban developmenthealth and human services\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Those programs closed to new loans during the shutdown. The shutdown has also halted the issuance and renewal of flood insurance policies, delaying mortgage closings and real estate transactions.\n The Federal Aviation Administration has reported air controller shortages in cities across the United States, from airports in Boston and Philadelphia to control centres in Atlanta and Houston.

It remains to be seen how things will shake out this time, but neither side appears to be budging.\n So far, the public is rather split on who is to blame for the impasse. Roughly 6 in 10 US adults say Trump and Republicans in Congress have “a great deal” or “quite a bit” of responsibility for the shutdown, while 54 per cent say the same about Democrats in Congress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Centre for Public Affairs Research.\n Perceptions could change depending upon how much the White House uses the shutdown to eliminate Democratic priorities and Democratic-leaning states and cities.\n The administration has put on hold roughly USD 18 billion to fund a new rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River between New York City and New Jersey and an extension of the city’s Second Avenue subway.

The administration cited reasons apart from the shutdown for the funding changes.\n In the end, there does not appear to be an easy way out of the shutdown.

Some lawmakers are predicting it could become the longest, surpassing the 35 days from President Donald Trump's first term.\n\nThe Trump administration is using the current shutdown to buttress priorities it favors while seeking to dismantle those it doesn't. Nevertheless, Democrats are insisting that any funding bill include help for millions of Americans who will lose health insurance coverage or face dramatically higher monthly premiums if Congress does nothing. \n\nThe shutdown began Oct. 1. Here's a look at its impact so far on workers, the economy and the services the government provides.\n\n Furloughs and firings \n\nThe federal government employed nearly 2.3 million civilian employees as of March 31. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that about 750,000 of those employees would be furloughed each day during a shutdown. That means they don't report to work until the shutdown ends. Others are considered “excepted” and do go to work, helping to protect life and property and perform other essential services.\n\nBoth groups of workers will get paid, but on a retroactive basis. That means they are facing the prospect of missing a full paycheck later this month after receiving a partial one earlier for work performed in late September. \n\nThe nation's 1.3 million active-duty service members got a temporary reprieve. They were looking at missing a paycheck on Wednesday. But Trump directed the Pentagon to redirect money. A second reprieve looks unlikely.\n\nOf note for taxpayers, the government tab for paying furloughed workers while they are at home comes to roughly $400 million a day, according to a CBO estimate provided at the request of Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa. \n\nThe administration is also trying to fire thousands of federal workers in agencies that don't align with its priorities. Republican leaders in Congress have said that's part of the fallout from a shutdown. Past presidents, however, did not use shutdowns to engage in mass firings.\n\nThe Republican administration has announced one reduction in force affecting 4,100 workers, with the biggest cuts happening at the departments of Treasury, Health and Human Services, Education and Housing and Urban Development.\n\nWhite House budget chief Russ Vought said in an interview on “The Charlie Kirk Show” that many more are planned.\n\n“I think we’ll probably end up being north of 10,000,” Vought said.\n\n“We want to be very aggressive where we can be in shuttering the bureaucracy,” Vought said. “Not just the funding, but the bureaucracy, that we now have an opportunity to do that.”\n\nA federal judge has temporarily blocked the firings, saying the cuts appeared to be politically motivated and were being carried out without much thought. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that the administration was “100%” confident that it will prevail on the merits in subsequent legal action.\n\nLawmakers acknowledge that many federal workers live paycheck to paycheck and will face some financial stress during the shutdown. Food banks in some communities have boosted efforts to help them. The Capital Area Food Bank, for example, said it would hold additional food distributions in the Washington region beginning Monday to support federal workers and contractors.\n\n Economic Impact \n\nPast shutdowns have had slight impacts on the economy, reducing growth in the quarter during which the shutdown occurs, but growth increases slightly in the following three months to help make up for it.\n\nOne estimate from Oxford Economics said a shutdown reduces economic growth by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points per week.

Our sovereign power flows from God to us. We lend power to our federal and state governments through the loan agreement called the U.S. Constitution. This is radically different from Great Britain, from which we escaped, where the king or queen has sovereign power—and hands out sovereign crumbs to placate their subjects through documents like the Magna Carta. Our most crucial sovereign power, as We The People, is controlling our border and populace. We never gave away this power to unelected judges. Not at our founding and the passage of the Fifth Amendment. Not after the Civil War and the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment. Not in any subsequent Congress. Certainly not after the last election. Judges simply do not have the power to steal We The People's sovereign power to control our border and populace. This includes the crucial issue of birthright citizenship. TRUMP BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP FIGHT HEADS BACK TO SUPREME COURT AS NEW TERM BEGINS Enacted after the Civil War to guarantee citizenship to the freed slaves and their descendants, the Fourteenth Amendment dictates that those persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States receive birthright citizenship. This phrase has, over the decades, developed an absurd meaning that is incorrect and incentivizes illegal immigration. Like the children of foreign ambassadors or invading armies, illegal immigrants are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Rather, they are foreign citizens subject to the jurisdiction of their home countries. For this reason, illegal immigrants cannot serve in the military or in government. Instead, they come to the United States and obtain jobs in secret, paid under the table, to avoid detection. The Supreme Court previously ruled in Elk v. Wilkins (1884) that the Fourteenth Amendment’s birthright citizenship did not apply to the children of American Indians. Congress then passed a statute granting birthright citizenship to them. Answer this dispositive question: If birthright citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't apply to American Indians, in what world would it apply to illegal aliens? It simply does not. If illegal immigrants are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, it makes no sense that their children are. If a child is born to American parents in a foreign country, that child is still American; for instance, many military children are born overseas. Logically, the reverse also should be true. President Trump, who has the same commonsense view of this issue, signed an executive order on January 20. The order dictates that children of illegal immigrant mothers and mothers here lawfully on a temporary basis are not entitled to citizenship, except where a child’s father is an American citizen or legal permanent resident. This order does not impact children already born here; rather, it only applies to children born 30 days after the order takes effect. If birthright citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't apply to American Indians, in what world would it apply to illegal aliens? The order has yet to take effect because several courts immediately enjoined it. This June, the Supreme Court dramatically curtailed the issuance of nationwide injunctions in Trump v. CASA; however, district judges continued to enjoin the executive order on the basis that classes of plaintiffs with the same common question—challenging the order’s legality—as well as states could challenge it. The administration has sought review by the Supreme Court prior to decisions by any appellate court. This filing, known as a petition for certiorari before judgment, is rare, as the Supreme Court prefers that cases proceed in the normal order. The birthright citizenship case, however, is an exceptional one, and the Supreme Court should grant the petition. In addition to the legal reasons why President Trump’s order should survive any challenge, there are important policy issues at stake. Many illegal immigrants want to bear children in the United States so those children can enjoy the benefits of American citizenship. These illegal aliens will risk their lives in many cases, either taking a chance on drowning in the Rio Grande or dying in the sweltering desert. Many illegals pay smugglers to assist them in crossing the border. Many of these smugglers are violent and engage in armed conflicts with Border Patrol agents, jeopardizing the lives of the agents, the illegal immigrant mothers, and the unborn children of pregnant illegals. In short, the current policy of birthright citizenship incentivizes illegal immigration and results in many dangerous border crossings. This irrational policy must change, and President Trump deserves massive credit for endeavoring to do so. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Leftists have asserted in the media and in litigation that President Trump’s order is plainly illegal. The Supreme Court, however, has never addressed the specific question of whether children born to illegal immigrants are entitled to American citizenship. In United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), the Court addressed the issue of whether children born in the United States to permanent legal residents are citizens. The Court held that such children are because their status as permanent and legal residents demonstrates their allegiance to (\"subject to the jurisdiction of\") the United States. President Trump’s executive order, however, has nothing to do with permanent legal residents. The order concerns illegals and those here on, for instance, temporary protected status. As such, Wong Kim Ark is irrelevant, and President Trump is not, contrary to leftists’ claims, defying Supreme Court precedent. Leftists judges, to the contrary, are violating We The People’s most crucial sovereign power of controlling our border and populace. Our nation has a massive illegal immigration crisis. Over ten million illegals—and perhaps more than twenty million—poured into the United States thanks to President Biden’s abysmal border policy. Biden, Border Czar Kamala Harris, and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas spent four disgraceful years grossly mismanaging our border, causing a deluge of illegal immigrants in cities across the country. Some of these illegals have targeted Americans, committing murders, rapes, armed robberies, and home invasions. Other illegals have joined or were members of international terrorist organizations like Tren de Aragua. Still other illegals have made an income by selling drugs, including fentanyl-laced narcotics that have claimed many American lives. President Trump commendably is attempting to rectify the Biden border disaster, but inferior court judges have blocked his reasonable effort to do so. The time thus has come for the Supreme Court to intervene and affirm President Trump’s order that restores some sanity to our immigration system. Stealing We The People’s most crucial sovereign power to control our border and populace is the red line the Supreme Court cannot allow the federal judiciary to cross.","summary":"President Trump&apos;s executive order ending birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants faces court challenges as the Supreme Court considers reviewing the case.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/mike-davis-why-scotus-must-affirm-trumps-birthright-citizenship-order","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/09/birthright-citizenship-eo-challenged-by-aclu.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-18 12:18:54","author":"Mike Davis","authors":["Mike Davis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.157},{"id":370448578,"title":"The GOP’s extraordinary rhetoric about the “No Kings” rallies","text":"President Donald Trump and his allies have spent weeks painstakingly trying to manufacture an image of an irredeemably violent American left.\n\nThis despite a series of rulings from judges, including several Republican-appointed ones, saying the image being painted is a mirage.

Choo-choo, America. All aboard! Get on this train, or get off the tracks, because buddy, it is COMING right now. Fast and furious – almost like Kamala's incredible lies she's been spewing at every single stop. It's just one after another. Rapid-fire. They come so fast, I can't keep up. It's just one after another. Seriously. It's impossible. A few weeks ago, she showed up at campus bookstore and proceeded to tell the 14 fans that last year's election was the closest ever. Amazing. Obviously, it wasn't. Not even close. It was probably the most lopsided election of my lifetime, although what Obama did to poor Mitt Romney in 2012 may take the cake on that one. Once she stumbled her way out of the bookstore, our former VP found herself spewing more ridiculous claims just last weekend with … Hillary Clinton (!!!). Hillary! The OG! The two most insufferable people in America actually told the crowd that they were a combined 4-0 against Donald Trump in debates. 4-0! While those two absolute lies were certainly impressive, I think we may have a new leader in the clubhouse as we start the third Saturday of October. Take a gander: Kamala Harris is BACK, baby! I mean … she's just incredible. It's the best. Kamala took most of the first half of the year off after Trump humiliated her last fall. But folks, she is BACK and better than ever right now, and I cannot get enough of it. This is all just complete and total bullshit. Every single word of it. There is not a 13-year-old in the world who wakes up with climate anxiety. Not one. The ONLY Gen-Zer who even knows the term \"climate anxiety\" are the ones with purple hair and a closet full of \"my body, my choice\" shirts. They probably work a shift at Starbucks every few days. I guarantee you that they're unattractive. Do you want to find the 1% of the country who gives a shit about the climate? Go out today and find your nearest \"No Kings!\" rally. That's it. There they are. And guess what? There won't be any Gen-Zers picketing. It's all boomers. Mostly angry, liberal, old white women with short hair and Capri pants. That's it! There is no chance Kamala Harris' goddaughter called her up two days ago and openly wept into the phone over climate change. None. Zero. Zilch. This is Gaslighting 101. Pandering 101. It's complete nonsense. Even for Kamala – who is maybe the best liar in politics right now – this is a stretch. You know who the Gen-Zers voted for last fall? Donald Trump. I've said it for a year now – the Dems somehow lost the Gen-Z vote. Do you know how hard that is to do? I've lived my whole life with the young demographic voting Democrat. Literally, my whole life.

In fact, he is thinking back to Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African American student from Florida who was shot dead by a white Latino neighbourhood watch volunteer in 2012.\n\n“The Martin case – the nightmare specter of a lynching screaming across the void of history – ruined the mood of a nation that had, just a few years earlier, elected its first black president, and in a dizzying moment of self-congratulation, began to ponder on editorial pages whether the nation was now ‘post-racial’,” Cobb writes in the introduction to his book Three or More Is a Riot: Notes on How We Got Here: 2012-2025.\n\nMany of the essays in the collection were written contemporaneously, affording them the irony – sometimes bitter irony – of distance. Together they form a portrait of an era bookended by the killing of Martin and the return to power of Donald Trump, with frontline reporting from Ferguson and Minneapolis along the way. They make a compelling argument that everything is connected and nothing is inevitable about racial justice or democracy.\n\nAs Cobb chronicles across 437 pages, the 2013 acquittal of Martin’s killer, George Zimmerman, became a catalyst for conversations about racial profiling, gun laws and systemic racism, helping to inspire the formation of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThree years later, Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old white supremacist, attended a Bible study session at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, then opened fire and killed nine Black parishioners. Cobb notes that Roof told police he had been “radicalised” by the aftermath of Martin’s killing and wanted to start a “race war”.\n\nSpeaking by phone from his office at Columbia, Cobb, 56, says: “It was a very upside-down version of the facts because he looked on Martin’s death and somehow took the reaction to it as a threat to white people and that was what set him on his path. Roof was this kind of precursor of the cause of white nationalism and white supremacy that becomes so prominent now.”\n\nThen, in the pandemic-racked summer of 2020, came George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man murdered by a white police officer who kneeled on his neck for almost nine minutes as Floyd said, “I can’t breathe,” more than 20 times. Black Lives Matter protesters took to the streets with demands to end police brutality, invest in Black communities and address systemic racism across various institutions.\n\nCobb, an author, historian and staff writer at the New Yorker magazine, continues: “It was the high tide. A lot of the organising, a lot of the kinds of thinking, the perspective and the work and the cultural kinds of representations – these things had begun eight years earlier with Trayvon Martin’s death.\n\n“This was an excruciating, nearly nine-minute-long video of a person’s life being extinguished and it happened at a time when people had nothing to do but watch it. They weren’t able to go to work because people were in lockdown. All of those things made his death resonate in a way that it might not have otherwise. There had been egregious instances of Black people being killed prior to that and they hadn’t generated that kind of societal response.”\n\nCities such as Minneapolis, Seattle and Los Angeles reallocated portions of police budgets to community programmes; companies committed millions of dollars to racial-equity initiatives; for a time, discussions of systemic racism entered mainstream discourse. But not for the first time in US history, progress – or at least the perception of it – sowed the seeds of backlash.\n\n“It also was a signal for people who are on the opposite side of this to start pushing in the opposite direction and that happened incredibly swiftly and with incredible consequences to such an extent that we are now in a more reactionary place than we were when George Floyd died in the first place,” Cobb says.\n\nNo one better embodies that reactionary spirit than Donald Trump, who rose to political prominence pushing conspiracy theories about Barack Obama’s birthplace and demonising immigrants as criminals and rapists. His second term has included a cabinet dominated by white people and a purge of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.\n\nTrump lost the presidential election a few months after Floyd died but returned to power last year, defeating a Black and south Asian challenger in Kamala Harris. According to Pew Research, Trump made important gains with Latino voters (51% Harris, 48% Trump) and won 15% of Black voters – up from 8% in 2020.\n\nWhat does Cobb make of the notion that class now outweighs race in electoral politics? “One of the things that they did brilliantly was that typically politics has worked on the basis of: ‘What will you do for me?’” Cobb says. “That’s retail politics. That’s what you expect.\n\n“The Trump campaign in 24 was much more contingent upon the question of: ‘What will you do to people who I don’t like?’ There were some Black men who thought their marginal position in society was a product of the advances that women made and that was something the Republican party said overtly, which is why I think their appeal was so masculinist.”\n\nTrump and his allies weaponised prejudice against transgender people to attract socially and religiously conservative voters, including demographics they would otherwise hold in “contempt”. “I also think that we tended to overlook the question of the extent to which Joe Biden simply handing the nomination to Kamala Harris turned off a part of the electorate,” Cobb says.\n\nHe expresses frustration with the well-rehearsed argument that Democrats became too fixated on “woke” identity politics at the expense of economic populism: “They make it seem as if these groups created identity politics. Almost every group that’s in the Democratic fold was made into an identity group by the actions of people who were outside.\n\n“If you were talking about African Americans, Black politics was created by segregation. White people said that they were going to act in their interest in order to prevent African Americans from having access. Women, through the call of feminism, came to address the fact that they were excluded from politics because men wanted more power. You could go through every single group.”\n\nYet it remains commonplace to talk about appealing to evangelical Christian voters or working-class non-college-educated voters, he says: “The presumption implicit in this is that all those people see the world in a particular way that is understandable or legible by their identity, and so there’s a one-sidedness to it. For the entirety of his political career, Trump has simply been a shrewd promulgator of white-identity politics.”\n\nThat trend has become supercharged in Trump’s second term. He has amplified the great replacement theory, sought to purge diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and complained that museums over-emphasise slavery. His actions have built a permission structure for white nationalists who boast they now have a seat at the top table.\n\nMany observers have also expressed dismay at Trump’s concentration of executive power and the speed and scale of his assault on democratic institutions. Cobb, however, is not surprised.\n\n“It’s about what I expected, honestly,” he says, “because throughout the course of the 2024 campaign, Trump mainly campaigned on the promises of what he was going to do to get back at people. They’re using the power of the state to pursue personal and ideological grievances, which is what autocracy does.”\n\nIt is now fashionable on the left to bemoan the rise of US authoritarianism as a novel concept, a betrayal of constitutional ideals envied by the world. Cobb has a more complex take, suggesting that the US’s claim to moral primacy, rooted in the idea of exceptionalism, is based on a false premise.\n\nHe argues: “America has been autocratic previously. We just don’t think about it. It’s never been useful … to actually grapple with what America was, and America had no interest in grappling with these questions itself. Who has ever managed personal growth while constantly screaming to the world about how special and amazing they are?”\n\nCobb’s book maps an arc of the moral universe that is crooked and uneven, pointing out that, between the end of reconstruction and 1965, 11 states in the south effectively nullified the protections of the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments of the constitution, imposing Jim Crow laws, voter suppression and violence to disenfranchise Black citizens.\n\n“The constitution gave Black people the right to vote but, if you voted, you’d be killed and this was a known fact,” he says. “This went on for decade after decade after decade. You can call that a lot of things. You can’t call that democracy. It was a kind of racial autocracy that extended in lots of different directions.”\n\nHe adds: “We should have been mindful that the country could always return to form in that way, that its commitment to democracy had been tenuous. That was why race has played such a central role in the dawning of this current autocratic moment. But it’s not the only dynamic.\n\n“Immigration, which is tied to race in some ways, is another dynamic. The advances that women have made, the increasing acceptance and tolerance of people in the LGBTQ communities – all those things, combined with an economic tenuousness, have made it possible to just catalyse this resurgence of autocracy in the country.”\n\nIt is therefore hardly unexpected that business leaders and institutions would capitulate, as they have in the past, he says: “We might hope that they would react differently but it’s not a shock when they don’t. Go back to the McCarthy era. We see that in more instances than not, McCarthy and other similar kinds of red-baiting forces were able to exert their will on American institutions.”\n\nCobb’s own employer has been caught in the maelstrom. In February, the Trump administration froze $400m in federal research grants and funding to Columbia, citing the university’s “failure to protect Jewish students from antisemitic harassment” during Gaza protests last year. Columbia has since announced it would comply with nearly all the administration’s demands and agreed to a $221m settlement, restoring most frozen funds but with ongoing oversight.\n\nCobb does not have much to add, partly for confidentiality reasons, though he does comment: “In life, I have tended to not grade harshly for exams that people should never have been required to take in the first place.”\n\nHe is unwavering, however, in his critique of Trump’s attack on the university sector: “What’s happening is people emulating Viktor Orbán [the leader of Hungary] to try to crush any independent centres of dissent and to utilise the full weight of the government to do it, and also to do it in hypocritical fashion.\n\n“The cover story was that Columbia and other universities were being punished for their failure to uproot antisemitism on their campuses. But it’s difficult to understand how you punish an institution for being too lenient about antisemitism and the punishment is that you take away its ability to do cancer research, or you defund its ability to do research on the best medical protocols for sick children or to work on heart disease and all the things that were being done with the money that was taken from the university.\n\n“In fact, what is being done is that we are criminalising the liberal or progressive ideas and centres that are tolerant of people having a diverse array of ideas or progressive ideas. The irony, of course, is that one of the things that happens in autocracy is the supreme amount of hypocrisy. They have an incredible tolerance for hypocrisy and so all these things are being done under the banner of protecting free speech.”\n\nThat hypocrisy has been on extravagant display again in the aftermath of Kirk’s killing by a lone gunman on a university campus in Utah. Trump and his allies have been quick to blame the “radical left” and “domestic terrorists” and threaten draconian action against those who criticise Kirk or celebrate his demise. The response is only likely to deepen the US’s political polarisation and threat of further violence.\n\nSpencer Cox, the governor of Utah and a rare voice urging civil discourse, wondered whether this was the end of a dark chapter of US history – or the beginning. What does Cobb think? “There’s a strong possibility that it will get worse before it gets better,” he says frankly.\n\n“We’re at a point where we navigated the volatile moment of the 1950s, the 1960s, because we were able to build a social consensus around what we thought was decent and what we thought was right, and we’re now seeing that undone. Indecency has become a new hallmark.\n\n“But we should take some solace in the fact that people have done the thing that we need to do now previously. The situation we’re in I don’t think is impossible.”","summary":"In a new essay collection, the dean of Columbia University’s graduate school of journalism makes a compelling argument that everything is connected and nothing is inevitable about racial justice or democracy\n\n“From the vantage point of the newsroom, the first story is almost never the full story,” writes Jelani Cobb. “You hear stray wisps of information, almost always the most inflammatory strands of a much bigger, more complicated set of circumstances.”\n\nThe dean of Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism in New York could be reflecting on the recent killing of the racist provocateur Charlie Kirk.

The movement looks different than it did the last time around. It’s more hard-bitten. But it retains the same underlying idealism about the American project that led first to the explosive growth of the coalition, and then to its dismissal by cynics.\n\nToday, in a reprisal of the first “No Kings” rallies that took place in June, millions of protesters will gather around the country to express their opposition to Trump. Over the summer, protesters waved American flags, dressed as the Founding Fathers and the Statue of Liberty, and held signs with quotes from the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. Those rallies drew an estimated 2 million to 5 million people around the country—on the scale of the 2017 Women’s March that convened the day after Trump’s first inauguration, then a competitor for the largest single day of protest the United States had ever seen.\n\nOrganizers are now expecting an even bigger turnout. “We have a goal for No Kings to be the largest peaceful protest in modern American history,” says Ezra Levin, a co-founder of the progressive organization Indivisible, one of the many groups coordinating the demonstrations. MAGA, at least, is doing its part to deride the gatherings as uncool: “Anyone who participates in a No Kings rally is a dork,” one right-wing influencer wrote on X. Earlier reflections on the Resistance brushed it off as embarrassing pap. But such dismissals now risk ignoring the possibility that earnest outrage, at the right place and the right time, is itself a powerful tonic against the corrosion of American democracy.\n\nThe circumstances of Trump’s first presidency lent themselves naturally to the rise of a popular opposition movement. Here was someone who had secured the White House via the quirks of the Electoral College despite losing a majority of the vote, and under conditions muddied by Russian interference. The movement that became known as the Resistance grew rapidly in this context, in what the political scientists Theda Skocpol, Caroline Tervo, and Kirsten Walters termed a “civic explosion” of local political engagement across the country, largely by first-time activists inspired by their disdain for Trump’s policies and character.\n\nThat movement’s on-the-ground organizing proved to be quietly, but strikingly, effective. The early phase of the opposition to the first Trump administration—before the racial-justice protests following George Floyd’s murder, in 2020—was largely led by white, college-educated, suburban women, and many of them, yes, wore pink “pussy hats” and T-shirts with slogans such as It’s Mueller Time! But they helped secure the “blue wave” midterm victory in 2018 that flipped the House of Representatives for Democrats and allowed the party to begin clawing back Trump’s power through legislative oversight. And though that congressional response had its limitations—neither impeachment of Trump, after all, successfully barred him from office—the Resistance notched continued successes at a local level in countering efforts to pull books from school shelves and restrict access to reproductive health care after Roe v. Wade was overturned. And, of course, a Democrat won the White House in 2020.\n\nThen came 2024, and Kamala Harris’s failure to secure the presidency against the rising tide of inflation and post-pandemic malaise. Lara Putnam, a historian at the University of Pittsburgh who studies grassroots activism in Pennsylvania, told me that the progressive social politics and “focus on protecting democracy” of the Resistance were not well aligned with the concerns of less engaged swing voters, who chose Trump for economic reasons. Still, Putnam’s research shows that local organizing that grew out of the Resistance made an impact in 2024: Activists were able to help Pennsylvania Democrats hold on to control of the statehouse, even as the state swung to the right.\n\nWhen Trump returned to the White House in 2025, he did so with a new claim to legitimacy after winning a plurality—though still not a majority—of the popular vote. This time, the streets were quiet on Inauguration Day and immediately after. Some on the right saw this as evidence of a “vibe shift,” a broader turn toward right-wing cultural dominance and away from liberal and progressive ideas. The rapid capitulation of major civic institutions, such as social-media companies and law firms, only emphasized the supposed shift.\n\nIn this environment, resistance seemed pointless. Maybe even worse than pointless: It had been kind of cringe. Meaning: unself-conscious; overly sincere; insufficiently insulated from criticism by the protective layer of irony that allows a person to declare, when mocked, “Just kidding!”; and, worst of all, ineffective. Remembering the pussy hats, Liza Featherstone, a columnist for the left-wing magazine Jacobin, mourned, “It’s triggering to even write these things down.” The progressive writer Ross Barkan derided the “hysterics” of the first-term Resistance and hoped the new quiet might “speak to the growing maturity of America.”\n\nAs the reference to hysteria suggests, it’s difficult to fully disaggregate the substance of this critique from gender politics, especially because of the predominance of older women in Resistance organizing during Trump’s first term. Liberal politics, the humor writer Clare Haber-Harris assessed in early 2025, had become “middle-aged-women coded” and therefore “uncool.” These Resistance aesthetics contrasted with the macho energy of Trump’s second term, itself a promise that Americans wouldn’t have to listen to those hectoring women anymore.\n\nBut these dismissals both ignore the very real victories of the Resistance and miss why cringe was essential to the movement’s effectiveness. These organizers were people “who basically believed that there was such a thing as the rule of law, that there was such a thing as democracy,” Putnam told me, “and that these were things that were worth fighting for.” They were, in that sense, institutionalists—and therefore inherently opposed to MAGA’s devil-may-care desire to burn the place down.\n\nCringe “implies a kind of naïveté that so often gets coded as feminine,” wrote the New York Times columnist Lydia Polgreen, “a silly belief that human beings, through sincere effort, might actually improve themselves and the world.” Such a belief might seem uncool. But it can be a powerful tool with which to cut through the nihilism of Trump and those around him, which draws its power from its insincerity, its refusal to distinguish between truth and falsehood, its willingness to mock and degrade previously treasured beliefs. As one protest sign put it at a demonstration early in Trump’s second term: BE CRINGE. SHIT MATTERS.\n\nIdealism helped motivate Trump’s opponents during his first term. But it has the potential to carry even more weight during his second, given how the president’s anti-democratic project is not as constrained as it was the first time around. As Levin of Indivisible told me, “The real enemy in an authoritarian breakthrough moment is nihilism and cynicism and fatalism.” This idea was a regular subject of the philosopher Hannah Arendt, who famously argued that totalitarian regimes depend on eroding their subjects’ sense of political possibility. Such governments, she wrote, aim not “to instill convictions but to destroy the capacity to form any.”\n\n“I didn’t like resistlib cringe content in the first Trump administration,” wrote Adam Gurri, the editor in chief of Liberal Currents, in a social-media post two months after Trump’s second inauguration, admitting: “I was wrong. I was just being a snob.” As Gurri suggests, the administration’s insistence on irony and insincerity has given a new power to plain, old, corny symbols. Recently, a photo published in the Chicago Tribune went viral, showing a Marine veteran protesting amid clouds of tear gas in front of an ICE detention facility in Broadview, Illinois, stoically holding not one but two American flags. Even the name of the No Kings protest is a reclamation of foundational American heritage that might have felt cheesy a year ago, but today carries a new seriousness.\n\nStill, for “resistlib cringe content” to have power, it needs to be welded with concrete action. Otherwise it risks undercutting itself and breeding distrust, an unwitting imitation of MAGA’s nihilism. Last spring, Senator Cory Booker held the Senate floor for a record-breaking 25 hours in a speech railing against Trump—arguably the first time in Trump’s second term that a congressional Democrat sought to harness the energy of the Resistance past. Demonstrators wrote out lines from Booker’s speech on placards at protests held later that week. But those hoping that the speech would herald a newly confrontational Democratic Party were disappointed when Booker voted to confirm Trump’s nominee for ambassador to China weeks later.\n\nOrganizers today are conscious of the danger of speaking the language of resistance without wielding any power to match. In a pamphlet published shortly after the 2024 election, Indivisible acknowledged, “Too often in Trump 1.0, we embraced the aesthetics of protests instead of using them as part of a strategy.” Theda Skocpol advised would-be Trump opponents in advance of his inauguration that the most effective aspects of the previous Resistance were not the showy marches, but what happened after the pink-hatted demonstrators went home and got to work: the “persistent, community-based efforts” that focused on building support for Democratic candidates and sharing information about the local effects of planned Trump policies. These activists were not concerned with ideological purity tests, but with the practical building of power. Even at the time, this organizing work received relatively little attention from commentators sneering at the overly earnest aesthetics of Resistance “wine moms.”\n\n“The most effective resistance might be investing in things that Trump’s rhetoric tries to delegitimize: community solidarity, mutual aid, and bottom-up organizing,” one contributor wrote to a postelection symposium organized by the left-leaning journal Democracy. This suggestion turned out to be a markedly accurate forecast of what opposition to Trump looks like today. The series of rallies that culminated in No Kings has taken the form of distributed protests organized by local activists across the country, without one single focal point. (The June No Kings rally didn’t even feature an event in Washington, D.C., avoiding tangling with—or giving further attention to—Trump’s military parade that same day.)\n\nSince the summer, Trump’s strategy of shifting ICE and the National Guard from city to city magnified this localism. Each targeted jurisdiction has responded with its own character: Protesters gathered to confront ICE en masse in the middle of a Los Angeles freeway, or have danced in frog costumes in Portland, Oregon. With the notable exception of a protest held a month into the federal occupation of D.C., the District’s residents have opted against the large gatherings that the city saw during the Women’s March and the George Floyd protests. Instead, many of them focused on helping one another as neighbors—chasing away ICE agents and walking the children of immigrant parents to school in the morning. “The people getting food to families of migrant neighbors abducted by ICE is resistance,” the D.C. mutual-aid collective Remora House explained. In Chicago, David Black, a Presbyterian pastor whom ICE agents shot with pepper balls, described protests outside Illinois ICE facilities as not “resistance” but “world building”: “We are making ourselves into the world we want to give to the next seven generations.”\n\nThis sentiment is, arguably, cringe. But it is also, on the most basic level, the work of politics. And precisely for that reason, it is an attempt to countermand the senses of loneliness and unmooring from reality that Arendt identified as ingredients of tyranny.\n\nOrganizers of today’s No Kings rally have emphasized that the gatherings are just one part of this broader movement, an opportunity to loudly and collectively voice the defiance already happening on the ground. The Trump administration appears to have noticed. Although June’s No Kings protests gained relatively little attention from Trump and congressional Republicans, the party has busied itself over the past week with attacking the upcoming demonstrations as a “Hate America Rally.” The mood this time is darker than in June: The government is shut down, more National Guard troops are deployed on the country’s streets, and the administration is intent on portraying its political opposition as un-American. But the protesters are coming with the Stars and Stripes in hand.","summary":"But it’s also effective.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/10/no-kings-protest-good-cringe-resistance/684595/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ykPkI0zjLNO6g8w1EFTuOI05CaA=/0x0:5000x2813/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/10/2025_10_GoodCringe/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-18 11:00:00","author":"Quinta Jurecic","authors":["Quinta Jurecic"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.249},{"id":370415764,"title":"Top MAGA officials are growing 'crueler' in the service of Trump: analysis","text":"During Donald Trump's first presidency, he bitterly clashed with a long list of traditional conservatives who pushed back against his proposals — from a secretary of state (Rex Tillerson) to a White House chief of staff (John Kelly) to a national security adviser (John Bolton) to two U.S. attorneys general (Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr).

The pair — both in the software industry — were with friends Thursday in Dolores Park, a vibrant green space with sweeping views of downtown, playing volleyball under a blue sky and shining autumn sun. All around them, people sat on benches with books, flew kites, played with dogs or otherwise lounged away the afternoon on blankets in the grass. Both Limlamai and Saetern said San Francisco of course has issues, and some rougher neighborhoods — but that's any city. \"I've lived here for 10 years and I haven't felt unsafe, and I've lived all over the city,\" Saetern said. \"Every city has its problems, and I don't think San Francisco is any different,\" but \"it's not a hellscape,\" said Limlamai, who has been in the city since 2021. Both said Trump's suggestion that he might send in troops was more alarming than reassuring — especially, Limlamai said, on top of his recent remark that American cities should serve as \"training grounds\" for U.S. military forces. \"I don't think that's appropriate at all,\" he said. \"The military is not trained to do what needs to be done in these cities.\" Across San Francisco, residents, visitors and prominent local leaders expressed similar ideas — if not much sharper condemnation of any troop deployment. None shied away from the fact that San Francisco has problems, especially with homelessness. Several also mentioned a creeping urban decay, and that the city needs a bit of a polish. But federal troops? That was a hard no. \"It's just more of [Trump's] insanity,\" said Peter Hill, 81, as he played chess in a slightly edgier park near City Hall. Hill said using troops domestically was a fascist power play, and \"a bad thing for the entire country.\" \"It's fascism,\" agreed local activist Wendy Aragon, who was hailing a cab nearby. Her Latino family has been in the country for generations, she said, but she now fears speaking Spanish on the street given that immigration agents have admitted targeting people who look or sound Latino, and troops in the city would only exacerbate those fears. \"My community is under attack right now.\" State Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) said troop deployments to the city were \"completely unnecessary\" and \"typical Trump: petty, vindictive retaliation.\" \"He wants to attack anyone who he perceives as an enemy, and that includes cities, and so he started with L.A. and Southern California because of its large immigrant community, and then he proceeded to cities with large Black populations like Chicago, and now he's moving on to cities that are just perceived as very lefty like Portland and now San Francisco,\" Wiener said. Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, defended such deployments and noted crime reductions in cities, including Washington, D.C., and Memphis, where local officials — including D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat — have embraced them. \"America’s once great cities have descended into chaos and crime as a result of Democrat policies that put criminals first and law-abiding citizens last. Making America Safe Again — especially crime-ridden cities — was a key campaign promise from the President that the American people elected him to fulfill,\" Jackson said. \"San Francisco Democrats should look at the tremendous results in DC and Memphis and listen to fellow Democrat Mayor Bowser and welcome the President in to clean up their city.\" San Francisco — a bastion of liberal politics that overwhelmingly voted against Trump in the last election — has been derided by the conservative right for generations as a great American jewel lost to destructive progressive policies. With its tech-heavy economy and downtown core hit hard by the pandemic and the nation's shift toward remote work, the city has had a particularly rough go in recent years, which only exacerbated its image as a city in decline. That it produced some of Trump's most prominent political opponents — including Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris — has only made it more of a punching bag. In August, Trump suggested San Francisco needed federal intervention. \"You look at what the Democrats have done to San Francisco — they’ve destroyed it,\" he said in the Oval Office. \"We'll clean that one up, too.\" Then, earlier this month, to the chagrin of liberal leaders across the city, Marc Benioff, the billionaire Salesforce founder and Time magazine owner who has long been a booster of San Francisco, said in an interview with the New York Times that he supported Trump and welcomed Guard troops in the city. \"We don’t have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,\" Benioff said, just as his company was preparing to open its annual Dreamforce convention in the city, complete with hundreds of private security officers. The U.S. Constitution generally precludes military forces from serving in police roles in the U.S. On Friday, Benioff reversed himself and apologized for his earlier stance. \"Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,\" he wrote on X. He also apologized for \"the concern\" his earlier support for troops in the city had caused, and praised San Francisco's new mayor, Daniel Lurie, for bringing crime down. Billionaire Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, also called for federal intervention in the city, writing on his X platform that downtown San Francisco is \"a drug zombie apocalypse\" and that federal intervention was \"the only solution at this point.\" Trump made his latest remarks bashing San Francisco on Wednesday, again from the Oval Office. Trump said it was \"one of our great cities 10 years ago, 15 years ago,\" but \"now it's a mess\" — and that he was recommending federal forces move into the city to make it safer. \"I'm gonna be strongly recommending — at the request of government officials, which is always nice — that you start looking at San Francisco,\" he said to leading members of his law enforcement team. Trump did not specify exactly what sort of deployment he meant, or which kinds of federal forces might be involved. He also didn't say which local officials had allegedly requested help — a claim Wiener called a lie. \"Every American deserves to live in a community where they're not afraid of being mugged, murdered, robbed, raped, assaulted or shot, and that's exactly what our administration is working to deliver,\" Trump said, before adding that sending federal forces into American cities had become \"a passion\" of his. The responses from San Francisco, both to Benioff and Trump, came swiftly, ranging from calm discouragement to full-blown outrage. Lurie did not respond directly, but his office pointed reporters to his recent statements that crime is down 30% citywide, homicides are at a 70-year low, car break-ins are at a 22-year low and tent encampments are at their lowest number on record. \"We have a lot of work to do,\" Lurie said. \"But I trust our local law enforcement.\" San Francisco Dist. Atty. Brooke Jenkins was much more fiery, writing online that Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had turned \"so-called public safety and immigration enforcement into a form of government sponsored violence against U.S. citizens, families, and ethnic groups,\" and that she stood ready to prosecute federal officers if they harm city residents. \"If you come to San Francisco and illegally harass our residents ... I will not hesitate to do my job and hold you accountable just like I do other violators of the law every single day,\" she said. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) — whose seat Wiener is reportedly going to seek — said the city \"does not want or need Donald Trump’s chaos\" and will continue to increase public safety locally and \"without the interference of a President seeking headlines.\" Newsom said the use of federal troops in American cities is a \"clear violation\" of federal law, and that the state was prepared to challenge any such deployment to San Francisco in court, just as it challenged such deployments in Los Angeles earlier this year. The federal appellate court that oversees California and much of the American West has so far allowed troops to remain in L.A., but is set to continue hearing arguments in the L.A. case soon. Trump had used anti-immigration enforcement protests in L.A. as a justification to send troops there. In San Francisco, Newsom said, he lacks any justification or \"pretext\" whatsoever. \"There's no existing protest at a federal building. There's no operation that's being impeded. I guess it's just a 'training ground' for the President of United States,\" Newsom said. \"It is grossly illegal, it's immoral, it's rather delusional.\" Nancy DeStefanis, 76, a longtime labor and environmental activist who was at San Francisco City Hall on Thursday to complain about Golden Gate Park being shut to regular visitors for paid events, was similarly derisive of troops entering the city. \"As far as I'm concerned, and I think most San Franciscans are concerned, we don't want troops here. We don't need them,\" she said. Not far away, throngs of people wearing Dreamforce lanyards streamed in and out of the Moscone Center, heading back and forth to nearby Market Street and pouring into restaurants, coffee shops and take-out joints. The city's problems — including homelessness and associated grittiness — were apparent at the corners of the crowds, even as chipper convention ambassadors and security officers moved would-be stragglers along. Not everyone was keen to be identified discussing Trump or safety in the city, with some citing business reasons and others a fear of Trump retaliating against them. But lots of people had opinions. Sanjiv, a self-described \"techie\" in his mid-50s, said he preferred to use only his first name because, although he is a U.S. citizen now, he emigrated from India and didn't want to stick his neck out by publicly criticizing Trump. He called homelessness a \"rampant problem\" in San Francisco, but less so than in the past — and hardly something that would justify sending in military troops. \"It's absolutely ridiculous,\" he said. \"It's not like the city's under siege.\" Claire Roeland, 30, from Austin, Texas, said she has visited San Francisco a handful of times in recent years and had \"mixed\" experiences. She has family who live in surrounding neighborhoods and find it completely safe, she said, but when she's in town it's \"predominantly in the business district\" — where it's hard not to be disheartened by the obvious suffering of people with addiction and mental illness and the grime that has accumulated in the emptied-out core. \"There's a lot of unfortunate urban decay happening, and that makes you feel more unsafe than you actually are,\" she said, but there isn't \"any realistic need to send in federal troops.\" She said she doesn't know what troops would do other than confront homeless people, and \"that's an image I don't want to see.\" Times staff writer Dakota Smith contributed to this report.","summary":"President Trump's suggestion that he will soon send federal forces into San Francisco was met with outrage and eye-rolls from local residents and leaders, who called it unnecessary.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-10-18/trump-federal-troops-san-francisco","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b171d64/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5400x3600+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff4%2Fe1%2F78227c8043f680dc64018029c806%2F1526412-la-me-sf-trum","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-18 10:00:00","author":"Kevin Rector","authors":["Kevin Rector"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.033},{"id":370418160,"title":"Justin Trudeau and Katy Perry’s Teen-Age Dream","text":"Yacht canoodlings and the gossip publications that love to feature them are nothing new: in the sixties, we had Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor vacationing on their yacht, Kalizma, off the coast of Sardinia; in the seventies, we had Jacqueline Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis sailing the Greek isles on the superyacht Christina; and, in the early two-thousands, we had Jennifer Lopez’s tongue-in-cheek music video for her single “Jenny from the Block,” which starred her then fiancé, Ben Affleck, having his picture taken by paparazzi on a yacht’s deck while applying sunscreen to his beloved’s bikini-clad buttocks. (In literature, the lineage of the yacht as a hub of romantic intrigue and rumor reaches even further back, to Edith Wharton’s 1905 novel “The House of Mirth,” in which the beautiful but doomed Lily Bart sails the Mediterranean with the conniving Bertha Dorset and her cuckolded husband, George.)\nIn recent years, though, the popularity of the celebs-on-a-yacht genre has reached new heights. After getting back together in 2021, Affleck and Lopez were spotted essentially re-creating the “Jenny from the Block” S.P.F. shot on a superyacht off the coast of Saint-Tropez, but this was just the tip of what has since become a full-scale iceberg. In 2025 alone, we’ve had, among many other examples, Leonardo DiCaprio and Vittoria Ceretti lounging deckside in view of Formentera; Dua Lipa and Callum Turner P.D.A.-ing off the Amalfi Coast; and Nina Dobrev and Zac Efron “sparking romance rumors,” per TMZ, in the waters of Sardinia. This overabundance has had something to do, I think, with the ascendence of the ultimate champions of yachting and lovemaking: Jeff Bezos and his bride, Lauren Sánchez. In the past couple of years, it has almost felt as if one couldn’t refresh one’s social-media feed without seeing new photos of the skimpily clad couple romping about the Amazon mogul’s five-hundred-million-dollar megayacht, Koru. Ass-slapping, picture-taking, foam-partying: it all went down on the boat.\nKaty Perry is a friend of Bezos and Sánchez and has herself spent time on Koru. In April, she also climbed aboard another vessel associated with the couple, when she joined Sánchez and four other women on Bezos’s Blue Origin space-tourism rocket, for an eleven-minute-long suborbital flight. This was figured as a female-empowerment-style, “Taking Up Space” mission, and Perry spoke, cheekily, of her desire to “put the ass in astronaut.” (“Space is going to finally be glam,” she predicted.) The trip, however, was met with much derision (the Guardian said that it signalled “the utter defeat of American feminism”)—a reaction which came on the heels of other public Perry letdowns. Last year, she released the single “Woman’s World,” which was roundly mocked for its dated girlboss messaging—the song, Pitchfork wrote, sounds like “its author had to have feminism explained to her by the top half of the first page of Google”—and which peaked at No. 63 on the Billboard charts. (None of the other tracks on her most recent album, “143,” charted meaningfully.) Though her ongoing Lifetimes world tour has reportedly been doing well commercially, Perry is clearly no longer the culturally relevant, multiplatinum-selling artist she was in the earlier days of her career.\nPerry’s new paramour, for his part, has also been going through changes. Trudeau, with his popularity as P.M. on the wane, following a growing deficit and tariff threats from Donald Trump, resigned in January as the leader of the Canadian Liberal Party—a position he had held since 2013. In March, after a decade in power, he stepped down from his role as Prime Minister. Suddenly out of political office, he was a private citizen for the first time in a long time. Whether in public service or not, however, Trudeau has always been one thing: a natural celebrity. With his movie-star good looks—tall, broad-shouldered, with blue eyes and a floppy mane—Trudeau is a Prince Valiant-style figure whether he is in power or not. (In 2017, a popular meme called him “Mr. Steal Yo Girl,” for the moony-eyed responses he seemingly elicited in Ivanka Trump, the Duchess of Cambridge, the actress Emma Watson, and even President Trump.)\nAs the son of Pierre Trudeau, Canada’s Prime Minister from 1968 to 1979, and, again, from 1980 to 1984, Justin Trudeau is also a political nepo baby. His innate glamour doesn’t just stem from Pierre’s onetime position, however, but, too, from the fact that both his father and his mother, Margaret Trudeau, were themselves natural celebrities who shone in the spotlight beyond the political arena. This figured, for one, in their romantic lives: Pierre, whose entrée into the Canadian political scene drew a fanlike frenzy dubbed Trudeaumania, dated Barbra Streisand in the late sixties; and Margaret, after separating from the much-older Pierre, went on to be romantically linked to Jack Nicholson, Ryan O’Neal, and, perhaps most notoriously, the Rolling Stones’ Ronnie Wood. (In her 2010 memoir, “Changing My Mind,” in which she openly discusses her struggle with bipolar disorder, Margaret wrote of those years, “I became a cover girl, a celebrity in an age before the celebrity culture, famous for nothing except for my scandalous behavior.”)\nTrudeau’s glitzy lineage might have readied him for what the life of an out-of-office politician increasingly looks like nowadays. It’s a role that someone like President Barack Obama, for instance, has played to a tee. Since leaving the White House, in 2017, Obama has been working on establishing the Obama Presidential Center, in Chicago; he has also done some stumping for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris during their campaigns; but he has mostly, as USA Today wrote recently, continued “to keep his sight set on opportunities in media and entertainment.” He and his wife, Michelle, have a deal with Netflix through the couple’s Higher Ground production company; he has signed—as Harris and Biden also have—with the talent agency C.A.A.; and he has been a prominent presence in the pop-culture realm, offering music, book, and movie recommendation lists to his followers on social media, and guesting on podcasts. (On Monday, he appeared on the final episode of Marc Maron’s “WTF” podcast.) He’s also hobnobbed, often on vacation, sometimes on superyachts, with the famous and ultra-wealthy: Richard Branson, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Hanks, Oprah, Steven Spielberg. His infiltration of Hollywood has proven so deep as to make him the object of unproven romantic speculation: Obama, a wild rumor went, was having an affair with the actress Jennifer Aniston. (Aniston denied the affair, and the Obamas said on a podcast that they were still together.)\nWhat’s become increasingly clear is that we’re no longer living in the world of the late Jimmy Carter, with his post-Presidency dedication to public service. Rather, we’re now in a world of levelled-out celebrity, sprawled out in the blinding sun. This is at least partly the effect of living in Trump’s America: the current President has been known for the length of his public life as, above all else, a very rich and very famous person, and, as Empire crumbles, what else is there to do but take his lead? You might be a reality star like a Kardashian or a Jenner, or a billionaire like Bezos; you might be an actor like DiCaprio or a media mogul like Oprah. You might even be a pop star like Perry or a politician like Trudeau. On the yacht, and in the camera’s gaze, all are equal, and all are having their moment, just trying to get through another day. ♦","summary":"The pair, spotted together on a yacht, seemed to represent a romance for an era of celebrity politics, when a former President has Netflix deals and the current President is a reality star.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/critics-notebook/justin-trudeau-and-katy-perrys-teenage-dream","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/68f132ecd531c177649ecb98/16:9/w_756,h_425,c_limit/katy_trudeau_mock_1016_v2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-18 10:00:00","author":"Naomi Fry","authors":["Naomi Fry"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.422},{"id":370414856,"title":"Do you think politicians should go on podcasts?","text":"We need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

At the time of writing, streams of these episodes have amassed a combined 74 million views on YouTube.\n\nFor her part, Kamala Harris also tapped into the power of podcasts in a bid to reach her target demographics, opting to appear on shows popular with young women and Black men.\n\nWhere The Joe Rogan Experience was the height of Trump’s podcast endeavours, Alex Cooper’s Call Her Daddy was the height of Harris’s (albeit to a much lesser extent).\n\nAs is often the case, what is popular in the US tends to find its way across the Atlantic, and podcasts have also played an important role in this year’s Irish presidential election – for one candidate at least.\n\nIndependent Catherine Connolly has been on her own blitz of Irish podcasts since announcing her candidacy in July.\n\nSo far, she has appeared on The Blindboy Podcast, The Louise McSharry Podcast, How to Gael (hosted by Síomha Ní Ruairc, Louise Cantillon, and Doireann Ní Ghlacáin), Joe Brolly’s Free State podcast, Síle Seoige’s Ready to be Real, and James Kavanagh and William Murray’s The Simple Life.\n\nShe also did a live podcast episode for online publication The Ditch.\n\nHeather Humphreys, by comparison, has so far only done long-form podcast interviews with the Irish Independent and the Irish Examiner. She also appeared very briefly on The Tumbling Paddies podcast (for approximately 2 minutes) during their ploughing episode.\n\nBoth candidates have committed to paying a visit to Journal HQ next week for interviews on our political podcast, The Candidate, but other than that, it is not clear what other podcasts, if any, Humphreys plans to participate in before polling day.\n\nHumphreys’ decision to participate in so few podcasts so far during the campaign is not for lack of invitations.\n\nShe was invited to appear on the Louise McSharry podcast and How to Gael, but to date has chosen not to.\n\nConnolly’s campaign, on the other hand, has taken a totally different approach and proactively requested to appear on podcasts.\n\nNot all of the shows Connolly appeared on were happy to extend an invitation to Humphreys, however.\n\nSpeaking to The Journal, James Kavanagh and Blindboy both said they were approached by Connolly’s campaign and asked if they would do an interview with her.\n\nBoth agreed because they said they found her interesting. Neither podcast requested to interview Humphreys, or indeed, received requests to interview her.\n\nExplaining his decision not to extend an invite to Humphreys, Blindboy said:\n\n“I just don’t think we’d have the craic.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: “I only speak with people I’m genuinely curious about, and who I think my listeners will want to hear from.”\n\nMoreover, Blindboy said he tends to try to avoid platforming “party politics”.\n\n“I used to have Rory Hearne on a lot, but I stopped when he joined the Soc Dems. Even though I love Rory and he’s a brilliant guest. I want to avoid platforming any member of a political party.\n\n“I had Jeremy Corbyn on this year, but that doesn’t count because it’s the Brits,” he said.\n\nSimilarly, James Kavanagh told us that he wasn’t interested in having Humphreys on the podcast.\n\nLouise McSharry, whose podcast has more of a news and current affairs focus than Kavanagh’s or Bindboy’s, told The Journal that she received requests from Connolly’s team and Jim Gavin’s team about doing interviews and that she then contacted Humphreys’ team to ask if she would be interested in doing one as well, but she never heard back.\n\nGiven where things currently stand in the polls – the latest puts Connolly at 38% to Humphreys’ 20% – has it been a mistake by her campaign not to do more?\n\nAccording to PR and communications expert Eoghan Tomás McDermott, it has.\n\nMcDermott, who heads up the Communications Clinic in Dublin, told us that podcasts are a “hugely important” part of political campaigns in this day and age.\n\n“They’re a conduit through to an audience. The great thing about podcasting is that they tend to have rich data in terms of who is listening, and therefore make it straightforward enough to profile their audience,” he said.\n\nMcDermott said sometimes traditional media will be the best way to reach a desired audience, but more often, podcasts are also a useful way of doing the same.\n\n“And what you can also see is on some of those podcasts, they then clip it for social, which, in and of itself, gets a kind of a secondary media bang from it,” he added.\n\nEven though the podcasts Connolly has appeared on likely largely attract listeners who would lean left in their politics, McDermott said it’s useful to think there are “floating voters” among the listenership, too.\n\n“But they may decide, okay, although the listenership is big, the level of floating voters there isn’t significant enough for us to reach them,” he explained.\n\nAsked if podcasts are now just a part of political campaigning that candidates really need to be attuned to, McDermott said: “Absolutely.”\n\n“The amount of people now in Ireland who are consuming podcasts means that there is a significant audience, and that significant audience, in some ways, is up for grabs.” \n\nWhen contacted, the Fine Gael press office pointed us to the three podcasts Humphreys has participated in and said: \n\n“She has taken questions from journalists at doorsteps on every step of the campaign – often several times a day.\n\n“Our candidate has participated in debates and hustings at events across the country. In the final week, more media, broadcast and podcast interviews are planned.”\n\nThe election will be held on Friday, 24 October. \n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.\n\nOver 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.\n\nSupport The Journal\n\nJane Matthews\n\nView 38 comments\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “One candidate is winning the podcast war - the other has hardly been on the field”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “One candidate is winning the podcast war - the other has hardly been on the field”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nThis is YOUR comments community.

They control the Senate. They control the White House. They are in charge, and they are responsible for the shutdown,” she said.\n\nDemocrats, she said, “are doing the right thing by standing up for working people and not allowing the Republicans to carry a tax cut for the wealthiest people in our country on the backs of working people in America”. \n\nIt was just one example of Ms. Harris using her book tour to urge Democrats to lead a consistent, aggressive resistance to Mr. Trump while at the same time recommitting to reaching working and middle-class voters who supported the Republican or stayed home last November.\n\nOver the course of the day, Ms. Harris sat down for an hour-long conversation with five black college students, spoke to the AP and held two book discussions in Alabama's largest city. Paid ticketholders filled downtown Birmingham's Alabama Theatre, where Ms. Harris discussed her campaign, the Democratic Party and the course of the nation with radio host Charlamagne tha God.\n\nThrough it all, Ms. Harris projected the aura of party elder and future candidate. She expressed concern for the country's direction and outright incredulity over many of Mr. Trump's actions. When VIP ticketholders told her in a photo line how disappointed they had been by her loss, she played it forward.\n\n“We've got work to do,” she said repeatedly. “Keep fighting.”\n\nOn stage and to the AP, she praised her party's “deep and wide bench” and even called for lowering the nation's voting age to 16 to bring more young people into the political process.\n\nHarris signals she's not done\n\nMs. Harris, 60, maintained she has made no decision about her own political future. But she made clear that running again in 2028 is still on the table and that she sees herself as a player in the party and a voice in the national discourse.\n\n“I am a leader of the party,” she told the AP. “I take seriously that responsibility and duty that I feel”, as the previous nominee. That “includes travelling the country talking and mostly listening with folks,” she said, and “getting folks ready to fight in the midterms” in 2026.\n\nMs. Harris’s aides confirmed she will help Democratic gubernatorial candidates Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia with virtual events, fundraising appeals and robocalls. She also recently headlined a fundraiser for North Carolina Senate candidate Roy Cooper, a former Governor and Ms. Harris’s longtime friend.\n\nLater this month, she plans to campaign for California's “Yes on Prop 50”, the ballot measure that would allow a Democratic-led redraw of the State's congressional districts to counter Republican gerrymandering in Texas and other Republican-controlled States.\n\nAuthenticity will be key for Democratic candidates\n\nMs. Harris, who was unusually blunt in her book “107 Days” about her opinions on a range of political figures, was more circumspect on Friday (October 17, 2025) when asked to assess other leading Democrats.\n\n“We have to get away from this idea of ‘Who is the one?’. There are many ways that I think will be effective when people are authentic unto themselves,” she said when asked about her fellow Californian, Gov. Gavin Newsom, and his recent social media mockery of Mr. Trump.\n\nShe named U.S. Reps. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, and Brittany Petterson, D-Colo., but did not elaborate. \"Every voice and every perspective” can resonate with certain voters, she said.\n\nMs. Harris rejected conventional political wisdom that she lost in part because of Republicans' sustained attacks on cultural and social issues, especially transgender issues. She said economics, notably inflation, was the bigger factor.\n\n“There are a fair number of people who voted for Donald Trump because they believed what he said, which is that he was going to bring down prices,” she said. “Sadly, he lied to them.” \n\nEconomic arguments matter most\n\nWith prices still high and wealth gaps growing, Ms. Harris said, “We've got to do a better job of dealing with the immediate needs of the American people.” She praised the Biden administration's legislative accomplishments but said that household-level policies such as child tax credits, family leave and first-time homebuyer credits should have come before a sweeping infrastructure program and the CHIPS semiconductor manufacturing law.\n\nEven with a sharper economic message, Ms. Harris acknowledged structural challenges for Democrats: the proliferation of false information and what she described as conservatives' assault on democracy.\n\nShe rejected the idea of “low-information voters”, saying the problem is actually an abundance of misinformation and disinformation that makes it harder to reach many voters. She said that the Democrats must penetrate those silos rather than presume anyone is a lost cause.\n\n“They deserve to be heard,” she said.\n\nBacksliding on civil rights\n\nOnstage, Ms. Harris described a “reversal” of the Civil Rights Movement. She lamented that the Supreme Court could eliminate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which protects political district boundaries drawn to ensure minority communities can elect candidates of their choice.\n\nWithout that law, nonwhite representation — especially black representation in the South — could diminish considerably, from Congress to local school boards and municipal councils.\n\n“How can we say at this moment in time that the Voting Rights Act and Section 2 have no purpose?” Ms. Harris said to the AP.\n\nThe issue carried special resonance given the venue. The Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965 after Martin Luther King Jr. and civil rights leaders marched from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery. A later Supreme Court case out of Mobile led Congress to clarify its intent with Section 2 of the law. And it was a Shelby County, Alabama, case that the Supreme Court used in 2013 to gut the law's requirement that the U.S. Justice Department approve election procedures in local jurisdictions with a demonstrated history of discrimination.\n\nBesides the pending Supreme Court case, Ms. Harris said she has followed Mr. Trump's rhetoric on immigrants, along with statements from top Mr. Trump adviser Stephen Miller and other Republicans suggesting the U.S. owes its identity to white European settlers.\n\n“Just looking at it in terms of their words, they're race-baiting, they're scapegoating,” she said. But she stopped short of saying that the administration is being driven by a white nationalist ideology: “I can't pretend to know what is in their head.” \n\nMs. Harris said on Friday (October 17) that she never doubted former President Joe Biden's ability to serve, even when he ended his reelection bid because of concerns about his age. That's different, she explained, than discussions about whether the 82-year-old could have served another term.\n\n“He and I have been playing phone tag, actually, in the last couple of days,” Ms. Harris told the AP when asked whether she still talks to Mr. Biden, who is undergoing prostate cancer treatment. “I'd invite everyone to say a prayer if that's what you do for his well-being and health right now.”","summary":"“The Republicans control the House and the Senate.

Josh Shapiro recalls giving Biden brutal reality check about his 2024 campaign","text":"Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro recalled to “The Breakfast Club” in a new interview how he tried to deliver then-President Joe Biden bad news about the election before Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nNearly a year after the 2024 election, which was seen as a reckoning for Democrats, the party is still trying to make sense of where they have gone wrong in recent years.\n\nShapiro, who presents himself as a moderate for the party who goes out of his way to engage with conservatives, spoke candidly about his sober warnings to Biden when Biden was still the de facto 2024 Democratic nominee.\n\n“I went directly to the president and spoke to him about what I saw were, you know, his challenges in Pennsylvania. I was really honest with him,” Shapiro said. “We got together at a coffee shop in Harrisburg. I think this has been reported. I mean, I’ll just share with you. He said, ‘How’s it going?’ I was very clear: ‘It’s not going well.'”\n\nHe then recalled what he had told Biden at the time.\n\n“’Polls are showing it’s not going well,” he said. “I don’t think you’re handling the cost question. Back to what we talked about before with rising costs. It was a big theme in the campaign. Big issue in Pennsylvania. I didn’t think they were handling that well. I expressed that I thought people thought he wasn’t up to the job.”\n\nShapiro argued that his personal style and approach shaped the way he handled this conversation. \n\n“Look, maybe it’s old school, but I believe that if you got something to say, you say it directly to that person’s face, and he’s the president of the United States. I respected him, still respect him, and I respect him enough to say it directly to his face,” he said. \n\nWhen asked how this sobering assessment was received at the time, Shapiro replied, “I think he heard it. He told me that their poll numbers were different, and he seemed committed to continuing forward. And, listen, that’s his call.”\n\nHe also recalled arguing to Biden that part of his issue was that Biden’s team wasn’t straightforward with its own boss.\n\n“Breakfast Club” host Charlamagne tha God argued that such stories need to be told by any future Democratic Party contenders for the presidency, arguing that “anybody that wants to lead this party in the future has to throw that old regime under the bus.”\n\nShapiro, however, disagreed. \n\n“I don’t believe that you get ahead in life by throwing people under the bus,” he said. “I don’t believe that I got to kick somebody in order to get ahead. I think you’ve got to show your work. I think you’ve got to show a vision. I think you’ve got to tell people what you’re all about.”\n\nShapiro was vetted as a possible running mate for Kamala Harris, but she ultimately chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nShapiro was prescient about Democrats’ issues in his state because Trump went on to win Pennsylvania and the presidency.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Biden’s staff and did not receive an immediate response.","summary":"Nearly a year after the 2024 election, which was seen as a reckoning for Democrats, the party is still trying to make sense of where they have gone wrong in recent years.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/18/us-news/pennsylvania-gov-josh-shapiro-recalls-giving-biden-brutal-reality-check-about-his-2024-campaign/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/113689949.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/LWVcNYo8-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-18 05:39:41","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.715},{"id":370327552,"title":"Journalist slams ‘No Kings’ protest saying it’s a ‘clear cut case of Trump Derangement Syndrome’","text":"Journalist slams ‘No Kings’ protest saying it’s a ‘clear cut case of Trump Derangement Syndrome’\n\n ‘Fox News @ Night’ panelists Matt Bilinsky and Emily Austin discuss California’s homeless funds, Gov.

Andrew Cuomo, and Republican New York City mayoral nominee Curtis Sliwa faced off Thursday in a debate for the New York City mayoral race.\n\n“The tragedy for me is in two hours, the moderators never really tried to pin Mamdani down on the economic policies that he’s espousing. And how he proposes to pay for things that are not currently affordable. The other candidates didn’t do it either,” Halperin said on “Special Report with Bret Baier.”\n\n“And I think even though, as Mark [Penn] said, there is another debate, I think he’s going to be elected mayor of New York City without even [coming] close to explaining how his numbers add up on the outside.”\n\nHalperin said it is “very difficult” to see how Cuomo can change the dynamic of the race.\n\n“I never like to take it away from the voters or declare it’s over, but I think it’s as cooked as a Twinkie and a pizza oven for 35 minutes,” Halperin added. “It’s very difficult to see how Cuomo changes the dynamic of the race. I don’t think Sliwa would be more likely to get out after his performance last night, because I’d argue he was probably the best person on the stage.”\n\nDuring the debate, the moderators asked Mamdani why he refused to endorse Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, even after she publicly backed his campaign. When asked by moderators to raise their hands if they would support Hochul’s reelection, neither Mamdani nor his opponents responded.

Instead, the socialist Democrat said he left his ballot blank to protest what he called “the Israeli genocide of Palestinians.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

If you're so worried about it to buy Kevlar underwear you'd think you might not get blacked out f***** up around people you aren't comfortable with,' he added in a separate post. \n\nHe even referred to someone who shared a comic strip satirizing the difficulties of women reporting sexual assault in the military as 'retarded.'\n\nIn a further investigation of his account, the Bangor Daily News reported he asked why 'black people don't tip' in another thread. \n\nHowever, in 2020, when a poster wrote that rural white Americans 'aren't as racist or stupid as Trump thinks,' Platner responded: 'Living in white rural America, I'm afraid to tell you they actually are.'\n\nIn 2021, he wrote in response to the adage that people become more conservative as they age: 'I got older and became a communist.'\n\nIn a different thread from the same year, one poster commented on a black lieutenant in the Army who was held a gun point and pepper sprayed by police during a traffic stop: 'Bastards. Cops are bastars.'\n\nPlatner wrote: 'All of them, in fact.'\n\nThe candidate, who was previously an oyster farmer, issued statements during the controversy denouncing many of these views, including that he was a Communist, that rural Americans were racist and his anti-police statements, he told CNN.\n\n'That was very much me f**king around the internet. I don't want people to see me for who I was in my worst Internet comment – or even frankly who I was in my best Internet comment. I don't think any of that is indicative of who I am today, really.'\n\nHowever, as the offensive posts began to mount, Platner decided to release a 5-minute apology video on Friday to try and diffuse the outrage.\n\nHe said that as he looks back on the posts, many of which are now deleted, he sees 'things that I absolutely do not agree with, I see words and statements that I abhor.'\n\nPlatner added, however, that he also sees 'the trajectory of my life' from a man who had gotten back from fighting if Afghanistan in 2011 and left the Army in 2012. \n\n'Some of the worst comments I made, the things I think are least defensible, come from that time.' \n\nHe blamed it on being in the infantry which he called a 'very male-dominated place' and pointed out that women weren't allowed to fight in the infantry at that point. \n\n'When I got out, I still had the crude humor, the dark feelings, the offensive language that really was a hallmark of the infantry when I was in it.' \n\nHe said they came from a time of his life where he 'can see myself changing' and talks about the progression of his language as the posts go on.\n\nHowever, Platner notes that he also became 'more disillusioned' as time went on with politics and the state of the world, a reflection of what he said was his own state of mind.\n\n'I was struggling deeply. I had PTSD, I had depression, I had all of things that come with serving in two wars that I eventually began to not believe in all,' he said of fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nHe said he was looking for 'community' and an 'outlet for my feelings, for my rage, for my isolation.'\n\nPlatner said 'that all went away' when he found 'actual community.'\n\n'The reason that I stopped posting on Reddit in 2021 was the because I found this,' he said, pointing to his Sullivan, Maine backyard. \n\n'I had moved back to my hometown, I'd found community, I'd started a business, I met someone to fall in love with, I began to really begin to feel connected again and not only did it make me feel connected, it gave me a lot of hope,' he said.\n\n'I went from thinking that people were bad to knowing that people were good. I went from thinking that there was no hope to having nothing but hope.'\n\nHe said that despite the offensive comments, he is 'very proud of the person I am today.'\n\n'I won't defend things I said in the past, I will say that if it wasn't for that entire journey, I wouldn't be who I am today and I am proud of who I am today.'\n\nPlatner said he was sorry to supporters who see 'someone they don't recognize' in the posts, adding that he doesn't recognize himself.\n\nHowever, he added that he does recognize that there are many people who feel the way he used to and implored them to find community.\n\n'I'm sorry for this. Just know that it's not reflective of all at who I am. I don't want you to judge me on the dumbest thing I wrote on the internet. I want you to judge me on who I am today.'\n\nThe scandal comes as Platner faces an establishment-backed challenger in the race to challenge Collins in 2026.\n\nMaine´s two-term Democratic Governor Janet Mills will run for the seat as well, setting up a possible showdown between the parties´ best-known figures in a state where Democrats see a chance to gain a seat in their uphill quest for the Senate majority. \n\nNational Democrats see Maine as an important target. It is in the only place on the 2026 Senate election map where Republicans are defending a seat in a state carried last year by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. \n\nThe party would need to gain a net of four seats, while most of the states with Senate elections next year are places where Republican Donald Trump beat Harris. \n\nMaine is an exception, while in North Carolina, where Trump narrowly won, Democratic former Gov. Roy Cooper is viewed as a contender, and Democratic former Sen. Sherrod Brown is running in Ohio, where Trump won comfortably.\n\nCollins has long cast herself as a reflection of Maine's independent spirit but has frequently voted with Trump on key issues. \n\nPlatner has the backing of Bernie Sanders, who posted on social media on Thursday that Platner is 'a great working class candidate for Senate in Maine who will defeat Susan Collins' and that it´s 'disappointing that some Democratic leaders are urging Governor Mills to run.","summary":"Platner's campaign has come under fire after his comments on the site between 2013 and 2021 showed offensive views on sexual assault, race and references to being a Communist.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15203615/Democrat-Senate-candidate-issues-groveling-apology-sex-assault-comments.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/18/02/103093841-0-image-m-22_1760750627276.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-18 01:49:34","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

I was really honest with him,” Shapiro said in an interview with The Breakfast Club, as reported by Fox News.He recalled meeting Biden at a coffee shop in Harrisburg. “He said, ‘How’s it going?’” Shapiro recounted. “I was very clear — polls were showing it wasn’t going well. I told him I didn’t think he was handling the cost issue properly. Rising costs were a major concern in the campaign, especially in Pennsylvania.” The 52-year-old governor added that he also told Biden that many voters “didn’t think he was up to the job.”\"Look, maybe it's old school, but I believe that if you got something to say, you say it directly to that person's face, and he's the president of the United States. I respected him, still respect him, and I respect him enough to say it directly to his face,\" the Missouri-born leader remarked.Asked how his feedback was received, Shapiro replied, “I think he heard it. He told me that their poll numbers were different, and he seemed committed to continuing forward.”Biden had faced mounting pressure to step aside following a poor showing in a June 2024 presidential debate against Republican rival Donald Trump, a rematch of the 2020 contest. After resisting calls for about a month, the Democrat ultimately announced he would not seek re-election.Then-Vice President Kamala Harris was later chosen as Trump’s Democratic challenger for the November election and had considered Shapiro as her running mate, before ultimately selecting Minnesota governor Tim Walz. The Democratic ticket was defeated by the Republican team of Trump—who won a second term after losing the 2020 election as the sitting president—and JD Vance. Trump carried all seven key swing states, including Pennsylvania.","summary":"Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro revealed he directly informed President Joe Biden about significant challenges in the state, including voter concerns over rising costs and doubts about his fitness for office, ahead of last year's election.

If he really believes that the job of making peace is done, then he is deluding himself. Just trying needs sustained focus, hard diplomatic work and a decision by the two sides in the fight that the time has come to make painful sacrifices and compromises.”\n\n“Many criticisms can be made of Trump over Gaza: that he could have done this sooner; that he emboldened Netanyahu to intensify the war before finally reining him in; that the latest effort to seek a deal only gained traction after Israel overreached by firing missiles into Qatar, a key US ally,” writes William Hague. “But it is also true that he has forced through the first stage of his plan by sheer personal will and the use of American power; and that the scenes of released hostages and aid heading into Gaza would not be happening without that. In a year with all too many foreign policy errors by Washington, this is a major achievement.”\n\n“For now, what Trump has achieved — albeit with some luck, and a certain war-weariness among the combatants — is reason enough for him to enjoy thanks and praise. But it would be a surprise if there were no disappointments, setbacks or violence in the months and years ahead. An impatient man, Trump will have to accept that his peacemaking work will not be done for some time to come. Maybe then, the superlatives will sound a little more convincing.”\n\n“Over all this celebration there presides the large, triumphal figure of Donald Trump,” writes Melanie McDonagh. “He came down from the presidential plane in Israel holding his fist aloft in a gesture of triumph. And you know what? He deserves it. He deserves his ovation from the Israeli parliament, too. Because it’s true what they say: without him, there would have been no deal. You don’t have to agree with all his political programme — and lots of us will have issues with parts of it — to give credit where it’s due: he set out to be a peacemaker, and he has succeeded. Well done, Donald Trump. And for those who can’t quite forgive him for winning the presidential election, ask yourselves this: how likely is it that Kamala Harris would have pulled off this deal, that it would have been her coming down from that plane with that gesture of triumph? Unlikely, I’d say. This is the beginning of the beginning of a peace but it’s still a great day.”","summary":"This week’s biggest news stories in review, and how the media has covered them","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/donald-trump-new-dawn-hamas-releases-final-hostages-b1253520.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/10/14/13/13-87898fa378f84900bbd47ce35b41bf97.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ce9pHVMo-MzYL9J7h.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-18 00:59:08","author":"Mark Wilkinson","authors":["Mark Wilkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.011},{"id":370267692,"title":"Senate Republicans deepfaked Chuck Schumer, and X hasn’t taken it down ","text":"Senate Republicans shared a deepfake video of Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, designed to make it seem like Democrats are celebrating the ongoing government shutdown, which has lasted 16 days. \n\nIn the deepfake, an AI-generated Schumer repeats the phrase “every day gets better for us,” an actual quote taken out of context from a Punchbowl News article. In the original story, Schumer discussed the Democrats’ healthcare-focused shutdown strategy, and said they were not going to back away from Republicans’ playbook of threats and “bambooz[ling].” \n\nThe shutdown is happening because Democrats and Republicans cannot agree to pass a bill funding government through October and beyond. Democrats are trying to hold onto tax credits that would make health insurance cheaper for millions of Americans, secure a reversal to Trump’s Medicaid cuts, and block cuts to government health agencies.\n\nThe video was posted Friday on the Senate Republicans’ X account.

X has not, as of the time of this writing, removed the deepfake or added a warning label — though the video does include a watermark denoting its AI origins. \n\nThe Schumer video is not the first time X has allowed deepfakes of politicians to remain on the platform.

California, Minnesota, and Texas have banned deepfakes intended to influence elections, deceive voters, or harm candidates. \n\nThe latest post comes weeks after President Donald Trump posted deepfakes on Truth Social depicting Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, making false statements about immigration and voter fraud. \n\nResponding to criticism of the lack of honesty and ethics, Joanna Rodriguez, the National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director, said: “AI is here and not going anywhere.

Should I even be thinking about having children?’ That’s on top of unaffordable — not for her but for so many in that generation, they don’t aspire to own a home. They don’t believe it’s within their reach.”\n\nHarris made similar remarks while speaking at Reading Area Community College in Reading, Pennsylvania in 2020 — remarks which resurfaced during the 2024 presidential election. She spoke at the time about how “young leaders” told her “about a term they’ve coined called ‘climate anxiety.’”\n\n“Because young people said, ‘We’re not leaving it to other people to decide how we’re dealing with the climate crisis,’” Harris said. “You know, I’ve heard young leaders talk with me about a term they’ve coined called ‘climate anxiety.’”\n\nHarris continued to explain that climate anxiety was the “fear of the future and the unknown of whether it makes sense for you to even think about having children, whether it makes sense for you to think about aspiring to buy a home because what will this climate be?”\n\nHarris’s stepdaughter told her followers on TikTok in August that she feels “disgust” by what she is seeing in the world and said she is experiencing “a lot of climate anxiety” as well.\n\n“I think everything with the environment is really f—king getting to me. … I experienced a lot of climate anxiety, like a lot of us do,” she said, making it clear that it is “not funny.”\n\nVarious surveys over the past few years have indicated a high percentage of young people are very concerned about the climate (see here, here, here, and here). A 2023 Pew Research survey interestingly found that 55 percent of Democrats believe the trend of having less children has a “positive impact” on the environment. This belief can likely be traced to 78 percent of Democrats believing that climate change is a “major threat to the country.”\n\nData from Pew Research in 2025 found people in their 20s and 30s plan on having fewer children than in the past, even as the U.S. birthrate lingers around its lowest level, below replacement rate.\n\nBut young people statistically putting off having children and having smaller families and the existence of “climate anxiety,” particularly among far-left youth, does not paint the full picture.\n\nGallup reported in September that even though the U.S. birthrate is at an all time low of 1.6 births per woman, Americans say the ideal family size is an average of 2.7 children. In 2023, Americans’ preference for larger families — having three or more children — reached its highest percentage since 1971 at 45 percent.\n\nGallup noted at the time that the increase in 2023 came decades after “concerns about a global population explosion, resulting from the 1968 eco-doom bestseller book entitled The Population Bomb,” written by Stanford University biologist Paul Ehrlich. The book notably generated mass hysteria over the future of the world and the earth’s ability to sustain human life yet was demonstrably proved wrong.\n\n“Gallup has been measuring Americans’ opinions of the ideal family size periodically for almost 90 years. After falling steeply in the second half of the 20th century in parallel with the U.S. birth rate, Americans’ preferred family size has now stabilized at a level that well exceeds the actual rate,” the analytics firm reported in 2025. “The persistence of this gap suggests economic and cultural headwinds may be at work. High costs for housing, child care, healthcare and higher education, coupled with delayed marriage and parenthood, birth control and declining religiosity, are likely among the factors holding down birth rates despite a continued preference for more children.”\n\nGallup found differing attitudes about having children by subgroup. Specifically, men, U.S. adults who attend religious services weekly or monthly, Republicans, people of color, and men under the age of 50 are more likely than other groups to want three or more children.\n\n“Meanwhile, adults who rarely or never attend religious services, Democrats, white people, adults under age 30, and women under age 50 are significantly more likely than their counterparts to say one or two children is ideal,” the report reads.\n\nKatherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.

The local man, who fled in his luxury car, returned to the scene of the crime after the establishment posted his face on their Facebook account.\n\nHe paid his bill with real cash this time and even tipped the staff.\n\nWhen shaming works\n\nDine-and-dashers are a nuisance that every restaurant must endure, but Michael’s Bar and Grill in Manchester has seen more than its fair share in recent months. Recently, one man left a fake $1,000 bill that looked a lot like a real $100 bill for a burger and multiple sides, then sped off in his Lexus when the server went to retrieve his change.\n\nThis stung both because restaurants operate on thin profit margins and because servers rely on tips to make ends meet.

On Thursday, October 16, 2025, the 60-year-old media personality took to his official X account and took a jab at the American politician and attorney for claiming to be the “most qualified candidate” ever to run for the President of the United States.After the X account @libsoftiktok shared a video of Kamala Harris, claiming that some people said she was “the most qualified candidate” to run for President during an on-stage interview with journalist Kara Swisher, Piers Morgan appeared to disagree. Resharing the video on his Twitter, the English journalist tagged Kamala Harris and quipped:“WHO said that? I want names @KamalaHarris.” According to Fox News, during her on-stage interview with journalist Kara Swisher, Harris stressed that she “couldn't do enough” because of the relatively short time that she had on her 2024 campaign trail. Notably, after the former vice president appealed that she wanted voters to not only see her background of who she is as a person, but also see her professional qualifications, Swisher intervened and asked:“That’s a decent resume, but go ahead.”To this, Kamala responded:“Well, some people have actually said I was the most qualified candidate ever to run for president… I'm just speaking fact.” Kamala Harris hints at possible 2028 Presidential runKamala Harris \"107 Days\" Book Tour (Image via Getty)According to Fox News, Kamala Harris also seemingly hinted that she would be running for President in 2028. During her interview last week, when Swisher asked whether she would be running for President in 2028, the former Vice President responded:“Maybe. Maybe not.”Meanwhile, the former vice president was also asked what policies she would focus on if she were to be elected President. She replied:“It’s much too early to have that conversation… I literally yesterday would not have known that this Department of Justice would have indicted the New York Attorney General, right?”Notably, Harris also took a jab at the current President of the US, Donald Trump and the Department of Justice. The 60-year-old told Swisher that she believed that the Democratic Party is responsible for dealing with the immediate needs of the American people and added:“I actually, in reflection, one of the things I would have done differently — and I talk about a few things but one of them on this topic — I really do think we should have done the families piece of ‘Build Back Better’ before we did the infrastructure and the CHIPS Act.”For the unversed, the former vice president has been out on a 15-city book tour in support of her memoir, titled 107 Days, which was published on September 23. Her tour reportedly kicked off in New York on September 24. Notably, her tour partnered her with independently owned bookstores across the United States. Kamala also reportedly stopped at the Masonic in San Francisco on October 5 for two events in collaboration with the Bay Area chain Book Passage. She will also be heading abroad for appearances in London and Toronto, and then wrapping up her book tour in Miami on November 20.","summary":"English broadcaster and journalist Piers Morgan recently shared his reaction after former Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris advocated for her Presidential run.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/podcasts/i-want-names-piers-morgan-laughs-kamala-harris-viral-claim-most-qualified-candidate-ever-run-president","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/10/130c5-17606949297953-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-17 21:03:53","author":"Afreen Shaikh","authors":["Afreen Shaikh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.085},{"id":370262712,"title":"Tommy Tuberville slams Democrats for ‘demonizing’ young male voters after AOC ‘masculinity’ remarks backfire","text":"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., had a highly scrutinized moment during Wednesday night's CNN town hall with Bernie Sanders, when the congresswoman addressed why she believed Republicans have more success garnering support among young men. \"They are able to radicalize, and target and exploit a generation of young boys, in particular, away from healthy masculinity, and into an insecure masculinity that requires a domination of others, who are poorer, browner, darker or a different gender than them,\" Ocasio-Cortez answered, garnering backlash on social media.

A Fox News voter analysis for the 2024 election found that 55% of men voted for President Donald Trump, and 53% of men aged 18–44 voted for Trump, while 57% of men over age 44 voted for Trump as well. The Associated Press found that more than half of male voters under the age of 30 voted for Trump instead of former Vice President Kamala Harris — including roughly six-in-10 White male voters supporting Trump — about one-third of Black male voters supported Trump, as did about 50% of young Latino male voters.

If anything, it energizes our voters even more.\" Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attended fundraising events for both Democratic gubernatorial candidates in October. Since leaving the Oval Office, Obama typically has held his endorsement card close to his chest.

THE ONLY TWO DEMS RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR IN 2025 ARE FORMER ROOMMATES WITH MIRRORING POLITICAL CAREERS Obama remained coy during the 2020 election about whom he would endorse, saying he would not back anyone during the primary. As Democratic contenders such as former Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race, Obama officially endorsed his former vice president, Joe Biden, after he became the party's presumptive nominee. Obama notably got more involved with the 2020 Biden campaign in its final weeks, holding his first in-person event amid the pandemic in Pennsylvania just days before the election. The 44th president called on Democrats to \"chill out\" during the 2020 primary season and wait to see which candidate would emerge successful in the primary process. \"There will be differences, but I want us to make sure that we keep in mind that relative to the ultimate goal, which is to defeat a president and a party that has, I think, taken a sharp turn away from a lot of the core traditions and values and institutional commitments that built this country,\" Obama said in 2019 at a Democrat fundraiser in California. \"Compared to that goal, the differences we're having right now are relatively minor. \"Everybody needs to chill out about the candidates,\" he added, \"but gin up about the prospect of rallying behind whoever emerges from this process.\" OBAMA, PELOSI, OTHER TOP DEMS RESISTED INSTANT HARRIS ENDORSEMENT CITING NEED TO 'EARN IT,' 'HIKING' EXCUSE During the unprecedented 2024 election cycle, Obama did not offer a formal, new endorsement of Biden's re-election run but did join him for campaign events.

Biden dropped out of the race July 21, 2024, and endorsed Harris to run in his place that same day in a separate social media post.

On Sept. 25, Trump announced a “deal” between TikTok parent ByteDance and a group of American investors, which Trump has indicated include conservative media titans Rupert Murdoch and Larry Ellison. The deal does not seem done, even though the administration is acting like it is.\n\nUntil the details get filled in, Democrats with any interest in having political power might consider doing two things. One is making a loud fuss about the transaction. The other is paying close attention to who put them in this predicament—specifically, Joe Biden and Democratic congressional leadership.\n\nIf the deal closes, it will be a long-term disaster for any left-of-center political project. Imagine Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter, but on very powerful steroids. Twitter gave him agenda-setting power on an app that most elite political journalists will never quit. It also made him a kingpin and punched his ticket to serve as co-leader of the free world for several months. Whether X was a tool of mass political persuasion in the 2024 election is less clear, though. The platform is a black box now that Musk has taken it private, and it’s overrun with spam and A.I. accounts. It’s also orders of magnitude smaller than TikTok.\n\nA conservative takeover of TikTok will be a much bigger problem for American liberalism, and anything left of it, than X could ever be. The platform’s rapidly growing and news-hungry user base is somewhere well into the billions, compared with Twitter’s pre-Musk usage of around 230 million daily users. Of all the major social media apps, TikTok is the one whose success is most rooted in serving content to people via an algorithm, rather than having users pick what they look at. The app’s success influenced almost every other social media platform to take a similar approach. TikTok has limitless influence potential, which is why Trump is so keen for his pals to control it in the United States.\n\nAmazingly, it was Biden who set up these pins and left the bowling alley for Trump to knock them down. This feels like an inopportune time to point out an ex-president’s tactical failure around a social media app, as Trump throws the military at his own people and turns the American regulatory state into a shakedown operation. But that’s just the thing: For Democrats, this is an exceptionally bad time to give Trump de facto control of one of the most popular information platforms in world history. And giving it to him is exactly what Biden did.\n\nTikTok took off in the United States during Trump’s first term, thanks to Lil Nas X and a bunch of teenagers. Its Chinese ownership by Beijing-based ByteDance quickly drew the attention of China hawks, who thought that the Chinese Communist Party was using it for either illicit surveillance of Americans, party propaganda, or both. There is a good bit of evidence on the feed manipulation point, including that TikTok has intentionally made it harder for researchers to get a macro read on the platform. There is less on the surveillance point. TikTok has violated U.S. child privacy laws in the past, but that’s just in keeping with the proud tradition of countless American tech firms. It’s genuinely hard to tell how much of TikTok’s bad behavior around user data comes down to a foreign influence operation versus typical tech company greed and recklessness.\n\nIt was Trump, not Biden, who first gave real juice to the idea of the United States banning TikTok. In 2020, Trump threatened a ban as retaliation for China’s handling of the coronavirus. A few years and most of a presidential term later, both the House and Senate finally passed the ban, as part of a bigger foreign aid bill. Democrats helped out in both chambers, with 165 of them voting to advance it in the House and 46 (all but two) in the Senate. Biden signed it in April 2024, weeks before he walked on to a debate stage in Atlanta and took a lectern across from Trump. Why did Biden sign this bill? Or, for that matter, not intervene with his own party’s congressional leaders before it ever got to him? House Speaker Mike Johnson undoubtedly wanted to make it hard to avoid a TikTok ban when he roped it into the same bill as aid money to Israel and Ukraine. Could it have really been that easy? Apparently, yes.\n\nThe ban, absent ByteDance selling off TikTok, was to go into effect on Jan. 20, 2025, immediately before someone would be inaugurated for a fresh term. What happened next feels like a perfect storm but was not that hard to foresee. Biden withered before our eyes. Kamala Harris replaced him and lost. Trump, who campaigned with obvious blood thirst, returned to power almost exactly concurrently with the ban’s effective date. Shortly before the inauguration, TikTok went offline for American users, but left a note: that Trump had said he would “work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!” The platform returned right after the inauguration, as Trump immediately made clear that the American government wouldn’t enforce the ban. The conservative justices of the Supreme Court (who had just upheld the law, along with the liberals) did not mind. Republicans in Congress didn’t mind either. Come to think of that, neither did Chuck Schumer. Trump has pushed back TikTok’s sell-by date four times so far as he’s angled for a deal that works for him.\n\nIn fairness, I had also been under the impression that laws were laws. But one of Biden’s many hubrises in 2024 was not seeing where this was all going, from his doomed campaign to the inauguration of an opponent who was always poised to take a mafioso approach to regulating mergers and acquisitions. Trump—the first president to publicly back a TikTok ban!—got to be its savior. “SAVING TIKTOK WHILE PROTECTING NATIONAL SECURITY” is the real title of a real executive order. All Trump had to do for it was not enforce a law that he had previously advocated for, and use the pressure of the state to get a favorable deal on whatever timeline he, personally, liked. What a sensational gift to get from his predecessor/successor.\n\nAs Biden exits public life, he has left the entire political left with a heap of trash to sift through. The previous status quo was that TikTok was controlled by a sleazy tech company that was a lot like our own homegrown sleazy tech companies, with some additional foreign policy concerns. The new status quo, if this deal closes, will be TikTok’s algorithm falling under the control of close allies of Trump’s who will unquestionably use it to promote right-wing speech at the expense of anything else. It is clear which of these situations is worse for American liberalism. Who did Biden think was going to buy TikTok, when he signed the deal compelling its divestiture? Which party’s billionaires had previously shown a bigger appetite for buying influential media platforms? What was the plan? Was Reid Hoffman going to buy it? Did Biden realize how ridiculous that sounds but decide to sign the bill anyway out of dutiful China hawkism? He had been moving in that direction even before he took office. Was there no other way to address national security questions than to try to force a sale, putting an amazing propaganda machine on the market for the right bidder?\n\nBecause this deal isn’t actually a deal yet—China hasn’t confirmed it, nor has ByteDance—there’s still a small window of time for Democrats to raise hell about it. That would be hard, however, given that the vast majority of the Democrats in Congress voted to let this happen. In that event, all Democrats can do is learn the right lessons—specifically, that you really can use the power of the state to compel the behavior you want from social media companies, and you don’t even have to be bashful about it. Republicans will (and do) accuse Democrats of colluding with social media companies to destructive ends. Why get the sizzle of the accusation without the steak of wielding government authority to put these companies under the control of people on your team?\n\nTrump’s allies are angling to maximize their control of legacy media outlets, and they’re doing well. The conglomerates that Trump’s friends have not already bought are under intense, nakedly partisan pressure from federal regulators. Most of the tech giants are either controlled by Trump’s ideological teammates (X), managed by executives who will do what Trump wants without too much pressure (Google, Meta, Microsoft), or run by people currently making their newspapers more right-wing in hopes of getting favorable treatment from the big man (Amazon). Conservatives are already doing a whale of a job taking over the American information environment. Democrats might consider reflecting on if they should have helped them take the biggest prize yet.","summary":"This is a bad time to give Trump de facto control of one of the most popular social media apps in history—and that’s exactly what Biden did.","url":"https://slate.com/technology/2025/10/tiktok-ban-biden-trump-conservatives-propaganda.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/7dc7d60d-329e-4225-a66a-26b2298afc88.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-17 19:37:52","author":"Alex Kirshner","authors":["Alex Kirshner"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":370268984,"title":"Wikipedia Editors Discuss Blacklisting CBS News After Bari Weiss Named Editor-In-Chief","text":"Following reports of former New York Times editor and the Free Press founder Bari Weiss being appointed editor-in-chief of CBS News, editors on Wikipedia began negatively slanting her page and those of CBS and the Free Press. This includes attempting to label Weiss as right-wing and slanted edits about a CBS settlement with President Donald Trump. Some suggested blacklisting CBS as a source in the future.\n\nNews about Weiss being appointed to leadership at CBS News first emerged on October 2 with the official announcement on October 6. The newly-merged parent company Paramount Skydance further announced its purchase of her Free Press outlet. Weiss previously worked as an opinion editor for the New York Times before resigning due to what she stated was relentless hostility from radical leftist co-workers. Her selection as editor-in-chief at CBS News reportedly sparked panic among left-wing journalists at CBS, though some apparently welcomed her leadership due to her pro-Israeli stance. CBS has faced numerous other difficulties this year that have also aroused unease at the outlet.\n\nDays after the announcement, Wikipedia editors began labeling Weiss and the Free Press as conservative, despite her identifying as centrist. Editor “Snokalok” added to her page a claim from left-wing New Republic that she was “anti-trans” among other labels. The edit was removed, but another editor subsequently inserted the “anti-trans” label citing LGBT advocacy media. Snokalok also pushed the label on Weiss at the CBS article itself, while claiming her appointment marked a right-ward shift, though this was partly undone. Snokalok’s profile page implicitly attacks Trump and references the false “Nazi salute” claim against Elon Musk. An editor’s attempt to label Weiss conservative was also undone.\n\nAnother editor added a paragraph to the article on the Free Press largely critical of its pro-Israeli stance and also repeatedly labeling it a conservative outlet. Self-proclaimed progressive Trump critic “Tataral” tried to label the outlet a “right-wing Internet blog” and suggested potential deletion of the outlet’s page, though this was undone an hour later for not complying with sources and past consensus. Tataral was previously involved in smearing Acting U.S. Attorney Ed Martin as “far-right” after he sent a letter requesting information about Wikipedia’s bias earlier this year. She also pushed “far-right” smears against Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk shortly after his assassination last month.\n\nFurther efforts were devoted to discrediting the Free Press and CBS. One editor added material claiming the Free Press falsely reported crime in Austin, Texas had gone up under a Democrat District Attorney when it had actually gone down. In fact, the article notes claims crime went down, but points out major crimes such as murder had risen under the DA’s tenure and cited critics attributing declines in lesser property offenses to declining prosecutions. A larger criticism section added by another editor to the page repeated the claims and others in the article accusing the outlet of misrepresenting the situation in Gaza.\n\nIn edits to the CBS article, an editor significantly expanded material about a lawsuit Trump filed against the network over deceptive editing of a 60 Minutes interview with then-Presidential nominee Kamala Harris, which ended with a settlement in Trump’s favor after a judge approved the suit for trial. The expanded material claimed the “lawsuit was widely described as frivolous by legal experts.” Cited was a CNN article, which linked to another CNN article citing three lawyers, including CNN’s own lawyer. A cited article in the Hill only described the case as being “on shaky ground” instead.\n\nMaterial added also included claiming as fact that the settlement with President Trump was due to needing FCC approval of the Paramount Skydance merger. However, the cited sources either don’t explicitly claim a connection or presented it as mere speculative opinion. Both Paramount and the FCC denied any connection between the two in several of the cited articles, but neither denial was included in the addition to the page. It also made unattributed claims about the settlement being a “blow to freedom of the press” despite the less opinionated sources cited attributing such claims to specific advocacy groups.\n\nWord of Weiss being appointed also prompted multiple discussions for potentially reviewing the current status of CBS under Wikipedia’s “reliable sources” policy central to its verifiability standards. One editor opening the discussion cited the “panic” among CBS journalists as a potential negative sign. Wikipedia’s “perennial sources” page currently colors CBS green, indicating it is considered “generally reliable” on the site. Discussions about “reliability” are the main vehicle by which Wikipedia editors have been purging conservative media including Breitbart News, reports of which went viral several weeks ago following an interview site co-founder Larry Sanger had with commentator Tucker Carlson when discussing his proposal for reform at the site.\n\nAlthough most editors advised a “wait-and-see” approach on CBS, with one outright mocking concerns, others were less hesitant. Editor “Monk of Monk Hall” stated Weiss heading CBS would impact its reliability and suggested collecting evidence for an eventual downgrade discussion. Monk was previously involved in spreading lies attacking Kirk prominently days after Kirk’s assassination. One editor responded to Monk with “evidence” against CBS, noting it now included reporting tied to the Free Press since the leadership move and also argued the outlet was not sufficiently critical of Israel. The same editor had added content seeking to discredit the Free Press to its page. Monk in turn criticized CBS for taking ICE reports credulously.\n\nSuch edits and comments fit a common pattern with Wikipedia blacklisting campaigns. Editors have frequently smeared numerous conservative outlets on their articles prior to pushing for them to be blacklisted, including in campaigns against Fox News and Breitbart News. Free Press is currently listed as a “marginally reliable source” where use is generally discouraged on the site. Attempts to further discredit it, while also tying it to CBS, could be used to build a case against CBS itself as some editors have already indicated.\n\nConcerns about Wikipedia’s bias against conservatives and Israel have prompted an investigation from the House Oversight Committee with bi-partisan members of Congress also inquiring about anti-Israeli bias. Earlier this month, Sen. Ted Cruz as Chair of the Senate Commerce Committee inquired particularly about the site’s sourcing blacklist. Stating Wikipedia was a “noble concept” in his letter to the owners of Wikipedia, Cruz lamented this made its systemic bias even more concerning, especially given its considerable influence on global information.\n\nT. D. Adler edited Wikipedia as The Devil’s Advocate. He was banned after privately reporting conflict of interest editing by one of the site’s administrators. Due to previous witch-hunts led by mainstream Wikipedians against their critics, Adler writes under an alias.","summary":"Following reports of former New York Times editor and the Free Press founder Bari Weiss being appointed editor-in-chief of CBS News, editors on Wikipedia began negatively slanting her page and those of CBS and the Free Press.

Jubilant crowds had gathered in the coastal Israeli city of Tel Aviv, some holding signs saying \"Thank you Mr President\" as they gathered to watch the historic event live on large screens in Hostages Square, where families of those captured had established a permanent encampment in the wake of October 7. Footage of Tel Aviv beach shows a massive sign featuring a silhouette image of Trump&apos;s head with the message \"thank you\", which could be seen from his presidential plane, Air Force One, as he approached the city. Even in the Knesset — Israel&apos;s parliament — where Trump made a speech on Monday, some wore bright red caps with the words \"Trump The Peace President\" printed on them, in a style reminiscent of his signature Make America Great Again hats. Itamar Rabinovich, professor emeritus of Middle Eastern history at Tel Aviv University, says there has been an outpouring of public support and gratitude for Trump in Israel. \"He is perceived as the leader who brought the war in Gaza to an end,\" Rabinovich tells SBS News. In contrast, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seen by many as the prime minister who wanted to keep the war going. \"Israelis overlook the fact that the same Trump supported Netanyahu, and his policy, until he reached the conclusion that it was time to end the war,\" Rabinovich says. \"Israelis who follow US and international politics were worried by several aspects of Trump&apos;s policies, but this scepticism is now concealed by the wave of enthusiasm that has swept the country.\" Emmanuel Navon, international relations lecturer at Tel Aviv University, says most Israelis appreciate and praise Trump for what they perceive he&apos;s achieved for Israel and the Middle East, not just the ceasefire. \"He&apos;s recognised Jerusalem as Israel&apos;s capital; has brought peace between Israel and three Arab countries; he has stricken Iran&apos;s nuclear sites … and he has blocked hostile decisions at the UN Security Council,\" Navon says. During his Knesset address, Netanyahu thanked Trump for a list of actions that affirm him as the \"greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House\". \"No American president has ever done more for Israel,\" he said. Among the actions Netanyahu listed and thanked Trump for was the US recognition of the Golan Heights as Israeli sovereign territory in 2019, but which is considered Syrian territory under international law and illegally occupied by Israel. Netanyahu also pointed to the signing of the 2020 Abraham Accords , which led to Israel establishing relations with the Arab countries Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. Morocco also later signed a similar agreement. Trump&apos;s decision to withdraw the US from the Iran nuclear deal was also acknowledged, as was his approval for the attacks on three nuclear facilities in Iran as part of Operation Midnight Hammer this year. Ahead of Trump&apos;s speech in the Knesset, Israeli President Isaac Herzog compared Trump to Cyrus the Great, a legendary figure in Jewish history who freed captive Jews in Babylon so they were able to return to Jerusalem. \"Thousands of years from now, the Jewish people will remember you. We are a nation that remembers,\" Herzog said. In his own speech, Trump acknowledged his personal links to Israel, saying his daughter Ivanka had converted to Judaism before marrying Jared Kushner, who is Orthodox Jewish. Jared Mondschein, director of research at Sydney University&apos;s United States Studies Centre, says Trump was \"uniquely qualified\" to broker the Gaza deal partly because he was perceived as being very pro-Israel. But Mondschein says Republican presidents have generally been received more favourably by Israelis than Democratic Party presidents. Ahead of the 2024 US presidential election, polling by the Israeli Democracy Institute found 72 per cent of Jewish Israelis thought Trump would be better for Israel&apos;s interests, compared to just 11 per cent who supported Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Even among Israeli Arabs, 27 per cent favoured Trump, compared to 22.5 per cent for Harris. Mondschein says compared with much of the developed world, Israel has a more positive view not just of Trump, but of America. A survey published by the Pew Research Center in June this year found 83 per cent of Israelis had a favourable view of the US. This compares to the median of 49 per cent among the 24 countries surveyed. Just 29 per cent of Australians had a favourable view. Mondschein believes the Trump administration was successful in securing a deal in part due to its unique ties with the Arab world. \"In my view, the Trump administration has not shied away from embracing the Arab world,\" he says, pointing to Trump&apos;s decision to go to the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, for his first official overseas visit as president in 2017. \"On the whole, the Trump administration has really curried favour with the Arab and Muslim world far more than prior administrations, both Democrat and alike.\" These relationships have helped apply multilateral pressure on both the Hamas and Israeli leadership, Mondschein says. Mondschein also credits the Trump administration&apos;s unconventional approach, including engaging envoys — real estate developer Steve Witkoff and businessman Jared Kushner— who are not seasoned diplomats. Kushner, who is also Trump&apos;s son-in-law, has business ties with many Gulf nations. Mondschein says some may consider this inappropriate for an envoy, but it may have built trust among Arab nations. Mondschein points out that 16 years of Republican and Democrat administrations had previously not made progress on the formal recognition of Israel among Arab and Muslim states — something the Trump administration was able to do with the Abraham Accords. \"That unconventional approach to the region has again, undoubtedly resulted in a more favourable outcome for Israel, and I would say the region more broadly, because it has, in my view, allowed for more stability in the region as a whole,\" he says. While Trump is being given the lion&apos;s share of the credit, Mondschein points out his 20-point plan is very similar to the plan developed by former Democrat president Joe Biden. Biden also secured the release of 105 hostages in November 2023, and a ceasefire his administration helped broker was in place at the time of Trump&apos;s inauguration in January this year. The ceasefire didn&apos;t hold once Trump took over, and there were many more months of bloodshed before another was negotiated. Trump&apos;s initial plan to \"take over the Gaza Strip\" and turn it into a luxury tourist destination — dubbed the \"Middle East Riviera\" — was widely condemned by the international community and later walked back by the US administration. His own 20-point plan was presented in late September and agreed to by both parties earlier this month, securing the return of the remaining hostages. Mondschein notes that in the early days of regaining the presidency, Trump gave Israel plenty of backing, and his White House secretary told reporters on 20 March that Trump \"fully supports\" the deadly resumption of air and ground operations in Gaza, while blaming Hamas for the violence. He believes public sentiment — reflected in protest actions in recent months — has applied pressure on world leaders, including Trump, to end the hostilities. But Biden is now referred to as \"Genocide Joe\" — a label first used by pro-Palestinian supporters and later adopted by Trump supporters — and Netanyahu isn&apos;t getting the same credit as Trump among Israelis for ending the war. During a public rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday night (local time), the crowd cheered when Trump&apos;s name was mentioned but booed when they heard Netanyahu&apos;s. Polling commissioned by Israeli free-to-air TV station Channel 12 and aired in July found more than half of Israelis surveyed thought Netanyahu&apos;s handling of the Gaza war was bad, and 74 per cent wanted hostilities in Gaza to end and for the hostages to come home immediately. \"I think a lot of Israelis were convinced that Prime Minister Netanyahu was prolonging the war for domestic political reasons, whereas they saw Donald Trump as someone who wanted the war to end,\" Mondschein says. In his speech at the Knesset, Trump seemed to affirm this view, indicating he had told Netanyahu \"it&apos;s now time\" for the war to end. \"[I] said to Bibi [a nickname for Netanyahu], the world is big and strong and ultimately the world wins,\" he said. \"The world wanted peace and Israel wanted peace ... everybody did. \"I want to congratulate you for having the courage to say &apos;that&apos;s it, we&apos;ve won&apos;, and now let&apos;s enjoy our lives and let&apos;s rebuild Israel and make it stronger and bigger and better than it&apos;s ever been before.\" Navon agrees Israelis are divided over Netanyahu; they either loathe or admire him, depending on how they perceive his role in the liberation of hostages. \"But even those Israelis who are critical of Netanyahu must admit that he has led Israel to victory,\" he says, referring to the release of the remaining hostages this month. \"It will be for Israelis to decide at the next election whether they still want him in power or not. \"And it will be for history to judge his overall record.\" While Trump received a warm welcome at the Knesset with numerous standing ovations and glowing remarks from Israel&apos;s leaders thanking the US president, Trump&apos;s address to the parliament was briefly interrupted by two left-wing politicians. Ofer Cassif and Ayman Odeh were both expelled after they attempted to interrupt proceedings. A photo posted to Cassif&apos;s Instagram account showed a piece of paper emblazoned: \"Recognize Palestine!\" \"This is the banner I waved in front of Trump at the Knesset and was subsequently removed from the plenum,\" Cassif wrote. Odeh, leader of Cassif&apos;s Hadash alliance, was also seen brandishing a page of paper and being removed. On the plane back to Washington from the Middle East, Trump was asked whether he supported a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \"A lot of people like the one-state solution. Some people like the two-state solution. We&apos;ll have to see. I haven&apos;t commented on that,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday. Australia, along with the United Kingdom, Canada and Portugal, recognised Palestinian statehood this month at the United Nations General Assembly. Mondschein says Palestinians have traditionally not had a favourable view of the US, although no country enjoys majority support among the population. \"I think the Palestinians over many generations now have seen one country after another not follow through on supporting their dreams and aspirations,\" he says. \"They really did not trust any country to pursue their support [for] them.\" Before October 7, the Arab Barometer poll found 74 per cent of Palestinians had an unfavourable or somewhat unfavourable view of the US. Six weeks after October 7, 99 per cent reported being dissatisfied with the role of the US. In the US, Mondschein says Jewish Americans, who are generally more progressive than average Americans, are also pretty torn in their opinions of Trump. A poll of Jewish voters published in May by the Jewish Voters Resource Center found 74 per cent disapproved of the job Trump was doing as president, and opposed his proposal to transfer Palestinians out of Gaza so the US could redevelop the land. More than half also thought Trump was antisemitic. \"On the whole, Jewish Americans mostly opposed Donald Trump, but there is far more support for his efforts in providing stability in the Middle East,\" Mondschein says. \"I think American Jews and Israelis would both support this peace agreement. \"Israeli Jews are perhaps less concerned about US domestic issues compared to American Jews, and that&apos;s pretty understandable.\" While Trump is spruiking the ceasefire as \"the dawn of a new Middle East\" and falsely claiming it&apos;s the eighth war he&apos;s settled in eight months, there&apos;s still a long way to go before there&apos;s peace in Gaza. (According to a fact-check by AP , several of the conflicts date back to Trump&apos;s first presidency, while others are not active wars.) There have been reports of Hamas and rival groups fighting for dominance in Gaza, and concerns around the return of deceased hostages . \"The question is, are we going to enter a new era, or are we simply going back to October 6 of 2023, [when] much of the Palestinian people are seeking economic opportunities, but Hamas is rearming, and Israelis are hoping that the economic opportunities in Israel in particular will disincentivise any attacks? That is the big question,\" Mondschein says. \"I think a big determinant of where we go from here is where the international community goes.\" Mondschein says it&apos;s not yet clear what assistance will be provided as part of an international stabilisation force. \"Are there going to be boots on the ground in Gaza, or are they simply going to provide more aid? \"There&apos;s a lot of details to still be determined.\"","summary":"The release of Israeli hostages saw Donald Trump hailed as a hero to the Jewish people this week.
