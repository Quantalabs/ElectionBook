The uproar follows the Trump administration 's declaration to its followers that there isn't an Epstein list, despite previous campaign promises to unveil all involved parties. Notably, it's Trump's own backers who are most irked by his sudden U-turn, with a new Democracy Institute poll indicating that 67% of MAGA supporters who voted for him last November are at odds with his decision not to release the client list, in contrast to 58% of Kamala Harris voters who also disagree. First-time voters in 2024 appear to be particularly incensed by Trump's choice, with a staggering 71% opposing his decision. Among all Americans, the figure dips slightly to 63%, yet this still signifies a majority, according to the poll. The incumbent's latest actions seem to be taking a toll on his approval ratings, signalling that even Trump's staunchest advocates might have found a reason to withdraw their support from the contentious figurehead. Presently, data shows that 50% of Americans disapprove of President Trump's performance, reports the Mirror US . All this turmoil has emerged after the Justice Department and the FBI issued an unsigned memo last week, asserting that there is no alleged Epstein client list, contradicting Attorney General Pam Bondi's February statement that the list was \"on her desk.\" The DOJ's decision has sparked controversy among Trump's supporters, with many viewing the Epstein case as a pivotal reason for backing Trump. FBI Director Kash Patel and his deputy Dan Bongino, before assuming their roles, had consistently spoken out about the list and the alleged \"deep state\" efforts to conceal it from the public eye. They also repeatedly insisted that Epstein did not take his own life. The DOJ memo confirmed that Epstein indeed died by suicide while detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center in New York City in 2019. On Saturday, the president took to social media to voice his discontent over the split within his staunch \"Make America Great Again\" following regarding this issue, throwing his support behind Bondi. In his extensive post, he made no reference to Bongino. \"What's going on with my 'boys' and, in some cases, 'gals?'\" Trump penned. \"They're all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! We're on one Team, MAGA, and I don't like what's happening.\" Nevertheless, following an exhaustive months-long review of the evidence held by the government, the Justice Department concluded in Monday's memo that no further revelations would be appropriate or justified. The department highlighted that much of the information was sealed by a court order to safeguard victims, and only a small portion \"would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial.\"","summary":"The poll found that 67% of Trump voters in the 2024 election disagreed with the president's decision not to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, compared to 58% of Kamala Harris voters","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/poll-donald-trump-humiliated-maga-35556042","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35556048.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_JS375324583.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-15 01:31:56","author":"Anthony Orrico,Mataeo Smith,Michael D.

This year, I authored two bills to help students experiencing homelessness.\n\nIn the 2022-23 school year, over 246,000 students in California experienced homelessness. Nearly 90,000 high school students were identified as homeless, including more than 24,000 12th graders. Too many young people who face homelessness struggle to access higher education, training and jobs.\n\nSB 685 will cover certain costs of attendance for homeless students, including housing and basic needs, at San Jose State and three other CSU campuses, so students can focus on their education and stay off the streets.\n\nSB 33 will create the California Success, Opportunity and Academic Resilience (CalSOAR) Program to temporarily provide homeless high school seniors with $1,000 monthly upon graduation, building on guaranteed income programs we’ve started locally.\n\nWe’ve seen these programs work, offering dignity, empowerment and stability. So, let’s make ending youth homelessness a reality.\n\nDave Cortese\nCalifornia state senator\n\nDA’s refusal to appeal\ncertainly seems political\n\nRe: “DA’s death penalty views reflect county’s” and “Ex-DA’s letter confuses death penalty question” (Page A6, July 9).\n\nThe letters of Daniel Mayfield and Terence McCaffrey both missed the main point of former Santa Clara County District Attorney Dolores Carr’s article (“DA didn’t appeal death penalty ruling. Was it all about politics?” Page A6, July 3) in which she criticizes the recent decision of her successor, Jeff Rosen, not to appeal the Superior Court’s denial of his motion to reduce the death penalty of mass murderer Richard Farley to a life sentence.\n\nSpecifically, the anti-death penalty Sacramento politicos recently passed the statute, under which Rosen filed his motion, in such a completely unfair “heads I win, tails you lose” fashion that the only parties to Rosen’s motion were Rosen, who opposes the death penalty, and the mass murderer such that, if Rosen/Farley had won their motion, none of Farley’s victims could have appealed.\n\nCarr wisely suggests that Rosen did not appeal his loss here because he does not want any appellate court to declare this new, highly dubious, “no adversaries” statute unconstitutional.\n\nJohn Haggerty\nSanta Clara\n\nDemocratic Party hasn’t\nfound winning message\n\nI am concerned that the Democratic Party has yet to develop an approach to change the minds of those who do not like Donald Trump but like what the Democrats have to offer even less.\n\nThe truth is that the majority of the country did not see an alternative to this human wrecking ball that addressed their concerns about conditions in the United States. The Democrats have been unable to counter the ultra-right’s defining abortion and transgender issues as threats to the traditional family. They have been unable to offer a coherent immigration plan that brings reasonable control to our borders, that reduces the real stresses to states with large undocumented immigrant populations, and that acknowledges some issues with the foreign criminal element.\n\nWaiting for people to hate Trump so much that they will vote Democratic is not a winning strategy.\n\nLarry Lauro\n\nColumn inflates scope\nof Trump’s victory\n\nRe: “Will political drift right last beyond 2024?” (Page A6, July 8).\n\nOK, I get it. Dan Walters hates Gavin Newsom, Democrats in the state Legislature, and liberals, period. His one-note song grows tiresome, but his characterization of the 2024 election in his column deserves refutation.\n\nHe claims that Donald Trump “walloped Kamala Harris.” Let’s look at the facts. Trump’s popular vote margin of 1.47% ranks as the fourth closest in the last 20 presidential elections since 1948. Put another way, the margin of victory for Trump was the forty-fourth worst out of 51 presidential elections since 1824. The 229,766 vote difference combining the three swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin would have swung the election to Harris if this relatively small number of voters had chosen Harris instead.\n\nThat’s what Walters calls a walloping. A little biased, are we, Dan?\n\nJ. Dan Rothwell","summary":"Also: DA politics &#124; Winning message &#124; Inflated victory.

As Virginians cast their ballots this fall, Americans will get a glimpse of how people in this bellwether state feel about President Donald Trump, Republicans, and their policies.\n\nIn one such key race, Republican incumbent state Del. Ian Lovejoy and Democrat Elizabeth Guzmán, a former delegate for Virginia’s then-31st District, will go head-to-head on Nov. 5 to represent the state’s 22nd District in the Virginia House of Delegates.\n\nLovejoy secured over 52% of the district’s votes in the 2023 election, beating Democrat nominee Travis Nembhard. The delegate for a part of Prince William County in Northern Virginia outside of Washington, D.C., is running for his second term this year, citing the need to lower the cost of living in one of the most expensive places to live in Virginia.\n\n“This session, I opposed $4 billion in new taxes and supported tax rebates to give every Virginia taxpayer a portion of their hard-earned money back,” Lovejoy told The Daily Signal. “I also co-patroned an initiative to eliminate the car tax through a constitutional amendment, but unfortunately, the majority party [Democrats] chose to kill this initiative.”\n\nThe Virginia delegate also said he is working to reduce crime and drug activity.\n\n“I support federal law enforcement in their efforts to detain illegal immigrants who commit additional crimes and their expedited removal from our society,” Lovejoy said. \n\n“I also supported a successful legislative initiative to hold drug dealers accountable by allowing manslaughter charges against them when their drugs lead to deadly overdoses,” he said. “After seeing what happened in our neighboring Loudoun County in my first term, I patroned successful legislation to combat the fentanyl crisis by making fentanyl education a statewide standard [in public schools].”\n\nRegarding the rise in data centers in Prince William County, Lovejoy said he is actively working to protect communities from “the detriment of out-of-control data center sprawl.” Data centers are large facilities that manage, process, and share large amounts of internet data. They require massive amounts of electricity to run, which often requires the building of new electric grid infrastructure in the communities where they are located. \n\nNorthern Virginia is home to the largest data center market in the world, constituting 13% of all reported data center operational capacity globally and 25% of capacity in the Americas, according to the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Policy.\n\n“A new issue that came out of the JLARC [Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission] study is that the data center industry will soon require infrastructure upgrades that could raise all ratepayers’ energy costs,” he said. “I have worked with necessary stakeholders to begin the work of ensuring data centers are paying their fair share and that ratepayers are not saddled with the cost.”\n\nIf reelected, Lovejoy said he would continue to regulate the data center industry and will “submit legislation that protects ratepayers” and “resubmit legislation to ensure these [data center] buildings are not built near homes, schools, or parks.”\n\nWhen Guzman, a former delegate and Lovejoy’s competitor, announced her run for delegate in Virginia’s 22nd District on Jan. 21, she based her run on fighting back against President Donald Trump.\n\n“Now, as Trump returns, I’m stepping back up. Virginia Democrats are defending a 51-49 majority in the House of Delegates, and my red-to-blue race is in a district Trump lost—one of the best opportunities nationwide to win,” Guzman said in her campaign announcement. “To fight back against Trump’s attacks on our immigrant families, public schools, health care, reproductive rights, and civil service, we need Democratic state legislatures.”\n\nGuzmán’s priorities, as listed on her website, include “reliable and efficient transportation,” “supporting veterans and military families,” and “protecting pregnant woman [sic] and reproductive freedom.” \n\nRegarding “commonsense gun safety,” her website notes that although she “respects the 2nd Amendment and would never do anything to impact the lives of law-abiding gun owners,” there is a need for “reasonable gun safety reforms.”\n\nFor instance, Guzmán supports “red flag laws” to permit a state court to order the temporary seizure of firearms of an individual when the court believes the person in possession of those firearms is at risk of harming himself or others.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris carried Virginia’s 22nd District by less than 2% over Trump in 2024. If this Nov. 5 election mirrors last year’s tight margins, the race for the district seat is likely to be highly competitive, with both sides vying for control.\n\nThe Daily Signal contacted Guzmán’s campaign but has not received comment as of publication time.","summary":"All eyes are turning to Virginia as the state heads into its off-year elections for governor and control of the Virginia House of Delegates this...

That moment changed the direction of America. | Opinion - USA Today","text":"A lot has happened since July 13, 2024.\n\nI remember vividly the moment when my husband told me that Donald Trump had been shot at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. \n\nIt was shocking. I didn’t believe him. \n\nAt first we didn’t know what had happened or how seriously the former president was hurt. Then those images of Trump with blood streaming down his face and his fist in the air emerged. He said the word “fight.” \n\nTrump was letting us know he was OK. \n\nIt was the moment that changed everything. \n\nTrump’s near brush with death and the way he handled it with bravery energized not only his base – but also those who had been hesitant to support him. \n\nThe momentum shift almost certainly led to then-President Joe Biden finally deciding to drop out of the race. And former Vice President Kamala Harris proved no match for Trump. \n\nAfter the attack, Trump said he believed God spared him to help “straighten out” the country. \n\nDespite the typical Trumpian bravado, there’s a lot to be said for what he’s done for the country since his reelection. \n\nTrump is fulfilling his promise to fix the border and the economy \n\nTrump ran on securing the border and turning around the inflation-plagued economy. And he’s following through. \n\nUnder Biden’s open-border policies, record numbers of migrants crossed illegally, overwhelming border agents for years. \n\nWithin weeks of Trump taking office, things changed dramatically and border encounters reached historic lows. \n\nThe numbers speak for themselves. According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in May, the Border Patrol released zero illegal migrants into the country. That’s a huge drop from May 2024, when agents released 62,000 migrants along the southern border. \n\nBorder encounters in general have fallen 93%. In May, the Border Patrol encountered 8,725 illegal migrants at the border, while in May 2024, that number was 117,905. \n\nTrump’s tough measures on immigration are working. \n\nThe economy also is on the upswing. The stock market is soaring, and the latest jobs report outpaced expectations. Consumers are feeling more confident with inflation falling. \n\nIf Trump would just lay off the chaotic tariff business, the economy would be going even more gangbusters. Yet, even after Trump announced new tariffs July 9, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closed at all-time highs.\n\nDemocrats have tried – and failed – to sink Trump \n\nAs I reflect on the first anniversary of Trump’s near-assassination, I also think about how completely ineffective Democrats have been in their years-long war against the president. \n\nThey’ve impeached Trump (twice). They’ve made him a federal felon. They’ve claimed he is Hitler. They said he would end democracy. \n\nNothing Democrats have done or said has worked. And their myopic focus on Trump has led them to neglect defining who they are. Voters have noticed, and Democrats have dealt with record-low approval ratings. \n\nA recent poll from Democratic super PAC Unite the Country, obtained by The Hill, shows that voters see the Democratic Party as “out of touch,” “woke” and “weak.” \n\nAnd Trump? He is looking stronger than ever. \n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

We tend to dismiss Page as “Strzok’s girlfriend.” But she was far more than that. Comey’s deputy was Andrew McCabe. McCabe’s right hand was Page. What’s more, Page was the FBI’s White House liaison during the Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump investigations. And her message to Strzok, a top soldier in the war against Trump: “POTUS wants to know everything we are doing.”\n\nThat president, of course, was Barack Obama. And he wasn’t talking about their canoodling.When Fox News broke the story last week about a criminal investigation into Brennan and Comey, their sources used the word “conspiracy.” Unraveling what that means would take a whole book. But let’s talk about one incident:\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2017, Comey headed to Trump Tower to brief the president-elect on the Steele Dossier. This now-infamous dossier had been compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, alleging all sorts of Trump-Russia connections, including sordid tales involving hookers in Moscow hotel rooms. CNN had the dossier story but did not have the “hook” it needed to run with the story. Comey briefed Trump on the trashy elements in the dossier.\n\nAlmost by the time Comey got back to his limo, the meeting was leaked to CNN. CNN magically had their hook, and “Russia, Russia, Russia” was born.What didn’t the FBI director do? Bother to tell Trump that he, the CIA, and Obama knew the dossier was nothing more than tabloid trash. Comey also didn’t bother to tell Trump the entire Trump-Russia collusion narrative had been concocted by Clinton’s campaign … in part to deflect from her own Russia-connected scandals. (Uranium One, anybody?) As John Solomon of Just the News reported Sunday, Special Counsel John Durham in a classified annex to his report “described how the Obama administration knew before the Russia collusion probe targeting Trump was opened that Hillary Clinton had personally approved a project to gin up a bogus Russia scandal against her GOP opponent.”\n\nWhy didn’t Comey tell Trump these two crucial facts? Because telling Trump the truth would make it a one-day story. And truth was the farthest thing from Comey’s mind.\n\nHad Comey gone rogue? Hardly.\n\nOne day earlier, on Jan. 5, 2017, America’s true day of insurrection, Obama held an Oval Office meeting to discuss the Trump-Russia business. In the room: Comey, Brennan, Joe Biden, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Trump-hating DOJ figure Sally Yates and top adviser Susan Rice. They discussed limiting what they would tell Trump about the Trump-Russia “Crossfire Hurricane” investigation. They talked about how to get incoming National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. They talked about how to use Crossfire Hurricane against the new president.\n\nAgain, we now know that they knew the Trump-Russia story was as bogus as one of Kamala Harris’ accents. They knew the FISA warrants used to spy on Trump were as flimsy as a Kim Kardashian bikini. \n\nDid Obama order the sabotage of Trump? I’ll ask you this: If you knew the Steele Dossier was trash, and you suddenly saw stories claiming it was true, damaging your successor, damaging the country, wouldn’t you be on the horn immediately to Trump? Of course you would. And if, by some miracle, the POTUS who wanted to know everything wasn’t told anything, once you did find out the truth, wouldn’t you be outraged that you had been lied to? Wouldn’t you join Trump in wanting the heads of Comey, Brennan, and Clapper? Not a peep out of Obama,\n\nSolomon revealed that the new FBI investigation goes far beyond Comey and Brennan. It’s probing the “grand conspiracy” “to meddle in three U.S. elections to the benefit of Democrats and the detriment of President Donald Trump.” It covers the 2024 lawfare against Trump; 2020’s 51 top intelligence officials, including Brennan and Clapper, falsely declaring Hunter laptop was Russian misinformation; all the way back to the tanking of the Clinton email investigation in 2016.\n\nThis brings us back to Page. In April 2016, Obama publicly floated the idea that Hillary should escape prosecution because she never would have “intentionally harmed” national security. (That’s not the legal standard.) Jump to May 4, 2016. Hillary has just clinched the Democratic nomination. Strzok texted Page, “Now the pressure really starts to finish [“Mid-Year Exam,” the code name for the Clinton investigation.]” Page responded: “It sure does. We need to talk about follow up call tomorrow.”\n\nAccording to White House logs, Page scheduled a meeting at the White House for the following day hosted by Christopher Fonzone, deputy assistant and counsel to Obama. Do we know what they talked about? We have an excellent idea. Why? Because by day’s end, the Washington Post was reporting from “U.S. officials close to the matter” that the DOJ was likely not to charge Clinton because investigators found “scant evidence that the leading Democratic presidential candidate intended to break classification rules.”\n\nJust as Obama had floated. A few weeks later, Comey made it official. The White House mission to end the case to help Hillary’s campaign was accomplished.\n\nIf the FBI is building a mob-like RICO case, they must have in their sights the capo-di-capi: The POTUS who wanted to know everything the FBI was doing.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

The exclusive poll shows 61% of those polled believe recent arrests had gone too far, while 23% thought they are just about right.\n\nWhen asked about whether or not the recent deportations of Venezuelans, Cubans and Argentinians made them more or less likely to support the president, 52% of those polled said deportations made them less likely to support Trump, while 26% said they were more likely to support him and 12% said it made no difference.\n\nThose polled were also asked about the administration’s termination of temporary protected status for Haitians living in the United States. Miami residents said they opposed the move, 59% to 24% who were in favor. 14% said they were undecided on the issue.\n\n7News’ political analyst Brian Fonseca said the results on TPS show Miami residents know about the situation in Haiti.\n\n“I think it also suggests that Miamians have a clear understanding of the dire situation that Haiti is in right now and I think that may be against the backdrop of this question that Miami residents recognize sending Haitians back is an incredibly difficult feat,” he said.\n\nResidents polled were also asked who they had voted for last election. 37% of them said they had voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris while 36% said they voted for Trump. 16% said they didn’t vote.\n\nBut the poll does show some Miami residents saying they have some buyer’s remorse. When asked who they would vote for if the election were being held today, 35% would vote for Harris, 30% would vote for Trump, and the remaining said they would either vote for someone else, be undecided, or abstain from voting altogether.\n\n“It’s not that you’re seeing a defection from Trump to say, ‘I should’ve voted for Harris.’ I’m not sure that’s what the data shows. In fact, you have a larger number of ‘give me a different candidate, or I’m not sure.’ and I think that is significant,” said Fonseca.\n\nThose polled were also split on the issue of the economy. 41% said the economy is worse under Trump while 37% said it was worse under former President Joe Biden and 20% said they weren’t sure.\n\n“People don’t really know the hard numbers. They just know, ‘Am I saving a lot more money at the grocery store? Have I seen the price of gas, have eggs dropped significantly? That’s the sort of kitchen table discussion where they just don’t feel it yet. Maybe they won’t, it just depends on sort of the trajectory of the economy, but it certainly the response indicates that people aren’t feeling it yet, for the most part,” said Fonseca.\n\nSee the full poll results below:\n\nCopyright 2025 Sunbeam Television Corp.

But all that petty derision reveals nothing about Congresswoman Crocket and far more about Kennedy’s own intellectual bankruptcy, moral squalor, and her talent for cheap, performative cruelty masquerading as political commentary. The only real skill she’s honed is making the shallow sound edgy to people too dim-witted to notice. If Kennedy had a real argument, she wouldn’t have needed to stack five personal insults on top of each other like a sad little Jenga tower of insecurity. A truly intelligent and competent commentator wouldn’t rely on crude, empty attacks in place of reasoned critique. She needed five insults because she had nothing else. No substance. No evidence. No point. No working brain cells. Just spit and bile. Just look how hard she had to work just to prove she had nothing. And ultimately, she demonstrated that she’s the one who’s actually mentally deficient. Kennedy’s rant came after Crockett dared to call out Donald Trump’s “racist and wrong” remarks about the president of Liberia speaking “such good English.” When Crockett labeled Trump’s words for what they were, the GOP rapid-response machine snapped into gear. Kennedy simply picked up that baton for Fox News. She didn’t contest a single fact. She went straight for the oldest, most cowardly trick in the racist playbook: smear the Black woman’s intelligence. Reduce her to a “dumb-dumb.” Make sure the audience sees her as unworthy of basic respect. It’s pathetic and so damn predictable. Kennedy knows she can’t beat Rep. Crockett on substance. She can’t out-argue her. Crockett is a civil rights attorney, a sitting member of Congress, a woman who can dismantle Republican talking points with her eyes closed and one hand tied behind her back. She is sharp, fearless, and unbothered by conservative fragility. And that terrifies mediocre bigots like Kennedy. This is the same Lisa Kennedy who made her name being smarmy on MTV in the 90s, who rebranded herself as a libertarian edgelord sneering at working people’s needs, and who has built a career in conservative media serving up sarcastic, punchline-level takes for an audience desperate for reassurance they’ll never have to take Black women seriously. Kennedy isn’t offering critique; she’s offering white folks a comfortable fantasy where no Black woman is ever smarter than they are. She’s the human embodiment of smug mediocrity. This is a woman who leveraged the aesthetics of rebelliousness into a decades-long gig kissing the ring of right-wing power while pretending she’s too hip to care about the damage. She’s the type who rails against government overreach but has no problem with state violence at the border or policing Black communities, the kind of libertarian who mocks student debt relief but wants her rich pals’ taxes cut. Kennedy has no policy chops. She’s not serious. She’s a lazy performer who built her brand on eye-rolling, faux-radical snark that crumbles the second you ask her for actual ideas. She’s the sort of TV pundit who thinks being mean is the same thing as being smart. She’s paid to pander to viewers who want to hear that even the most obviously intelligent Black woman in the room is a “dumb-dumb,” because that lie is easier for them to swallow than gagging on the fact that she’s one of the dullest minds in the room. “She is a recalcitrant piece of garbage.” That line is a window into who Kennedy is. She’s a smug, washed-up cable clown who traded whatever critical thinking skills she once pretended to have for the cheapest form of white grievance theater. She’s not a serious commentator. She’s a professional bigot-whisperer whose job is to sneer, belittle, and dehumanize Black women who won’t stay in the roles her audience finds comfortable. Calling Crockett “garbage” is Kennedy admitting that she can’t match Crockett’s command of the facts, her courtroom-honed intelligence, or her refusal to play nice for people who despise her. It’s Kennedy revealing that she knows exactly what her audience wants to hear and delivers it with a wink and a sneer. She’s not just smug mediocrity. She’s a willing foot soldier for white grievance politics, who lacks confidence in her own intellect and the right-wing worldview she’s there to defend. At the end of the day, she knows Crockett was right. But instead she says, “Look at this dumb-dumb.” Kennedy’s disrespect of a sitting Black representative was personal, and it was also universal. Every time a Black woman shows up in American public life with undeniable intelligence, whether she’s a Representative like Jasmine Crockett, a Supreme Court justice like Ketanji Brown Jackson, a Vice President like Kamala Harris, or a scholar, attorney, doctor, journalist, or educator, there is a reliably ugly backlash waiting for her. It doesn’t matter if she graduated from the nation’s top schools, served with distinction, or simply out-argues her opponents in debate. As soon as her intelligence shines, the slur emerges: “mentally deficient,” “low IQ,” “affirmative action case,” “DEI hire,” “dumb,” “illiterate,” “incoherent.” Source: Vinnie Zuffante / Getty This isn’t random name-calling. It taps into centuries of propaganda about Black inferiority. It’s the same old lie that Black people are less intelligent, especially Black women. It’s a deliberate racist strategy that is about policing who gets to be seen as competent, authoritative, or deserving of respect in American public life. Because for people invested in whiteness, a Black woman who is brilliant, articulate, prepared, and unafraid is a threat to the entire hierarchy they depend on. She disrupts the lie that whiteness is the natural home of competence and authority. The psychology behind it is pathetic. If you can’t disprove her, you have to degrade her. You have to reduce her to something less than you so you can feel safe, unchallenged, and unthreatened. Calling her “dumb” isn’t an analysis of her arguments; it’s an exorcism. It’s an attempt to expel her from the realm of people who have to be listened to or taken seriously. It’s about making sure the audience doesn’t even consider the possibility she’s right. This is why these attacks are so formulaic and so emotional. They’re not built to rebut a Black woman’s logic; they’re built to reassure the insecure. They work by triggering a familiar, comforting stereotype for white audiences: that no matter how many degrees she has, no matter how well she argues or writes, no matter how prepared she is, she’s still just a dumb, beastly Black girl who should know her place. Calling Jasmine Crockett “mentally deficient” is the white supremacist mind doing damage control. Kennedy called Jasmine Crockett a “dumb-dumb” not because Crockett is anything of the sort, but because she’s dangerously smart in ways that threaten conservative power. She knows the law. She knows how to use it. She knows how to make Republicans look like the unserious, unethical frauds they are. Kennedy knows that if people actually listen to Jasmine Crockett, if they hear her questions, watch her disassemble Republican witnesses, or see her call out right-wing hypocrisy in real time, then they might start to wonder why Kennedy and her Fox News pals never have any answers. She can’t say: Jasmine Crockett is wrong about Republicans shielding criminals. Because Crockett isn’t. She can’t say: Jasmine Crockett doesn’t understand the law. Because Crockett demonstrably does. All Kennedy can say is: Don’t listen to her, she’s a dumb-dumb. That’s it. That’s the entire intellectual offering. It’s the rhetorical move of a coward. Of a hack. Of a professional gaslighter who’s made a living comforting racists with the lie that any Black woman who challenges them is actually an idiot in disguise.

For months, rumors abounded that Paramount would eventually settle the seemingly frivolous lawsuit brought by President Donald Trump concerning editorial decisions in the production of a CBS interview with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, those rumors proved true: The settlement between Paramount and Trump’s legal team resulted in CBS’s parent company agreeing to pay $16 million to the future Donald Trump Library – the $16 million included Trump’s legal fees – in exchange for ending the lawsuit. Despite the opinion of many media law scholars and practicing attorneys who considered the lawsuit meritless, Shari Redstone, the largest shareholder of Paramount, yielded to Trump.\n\nRedstone had been trying to sell Paramount to Skydance Media since July 2024, but the transaction was delayed by issues involving government approval. \n\nSpecifically, when the Trump administration assumed power in January 2025, the new Federal Communications Commission had no legal obligation to facilitate, without scrutiny, the transfer of the CBS network’s broadcast licenses for its owned-and-operated TV stations to new ownership. \n\nThe FCC, under newly installed Republican Chairman Brendan Carr, was fully aware of the issues in the legal conflict between Trump and CBS at the time Paramount needed FCC approval for the license transfers. Without a settlement, the Paramount-Skydance deal remained in jeopardy.\n\nUntil it wasn’t. \n\nAt that point, Paramount joined Disney in implicitly apologizing for journalism produced by their TV news divisions. \n\nEarlier in 2025, Disney had settled a different Trump lawsuit with ABC News in exchange for a $15 million donation to the future Trump Library. That lawsuit involved a dispute over the wording of the actions for which Trump was found liable in a civil lawsuit brought by E. Jean Carroll.\n\nIt’s not certain what the ABC and CBS settlements portend, but many are predicting they will produce a “chilling effect” within the network news divisions. Such an outcome would arise from fear of new litigation, and it would install a form of internal self-censorship that would influence network journalists when deciding whether the pursuit of investigative stories involving the Trump administration would be worth the risk.\n\nTrump has apparently succeeded where earlier presidents failed. \n\nPresidential pressure\n\nFrom Jimmy Carter trying to get CBS anchor Walter Cronkite to stop ending his evening newscasts with the number of days American hostages were being held in Iran to Richard Nixon’s administration threatening the broadcast licenses of The Washington Post’s TV stations to weaken Watergate reporting, previous presidents sought to apply editorial pressure on broadcast journalists. \n\nBut in the cases of Carter and Nixon, it didn’t work. The broadcast networks’ focus on both Watergate and the Iran hostage crisis remained unrelenting. \n\nNor were Nixon and Carter the first presidents seeking to influence, and possibly control, network news. \n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson, who owned local TV and radio stations in Austin, Texas, regularly complained to his old friend, CBS President Frank Stanton, about what he perceived as biased TV coverage. Johnson was so furious with the CBS and NBC reporting from Vietnam, he once argued that their newscasts seemed “controlled by the Vietcong.”\n\nYet none of these earlier presidents won millions from the corporations that aired ethical news reporting in the public interest. \n\nBefore Trump, these conflicts mostly occurred backstage and informally, allowing the broadcasters to sidestep the damage to their credibility should any surrender to White House administrations be made public. In a “Reporter’s Notebook” on the CBS Evening News the night of the Trump settlement, anchor John Dickerson summarized the new dilemma succinctly: “Can you hold power to account when you’ve paid it millions? Can an audience trust you when it thinks you’ve traded away that trust?” \n\n“The audience will decide that,” Dickerson continued, concluding: “Our job is to show up to honor what we witness on behalf of the people we witness it for.” \n\nHolding power to account\n\nThere’s an adage in TV news: “You’re only as good as your last show.” \n\nSoon, SkyDance Media will assume control over the Paramount properties, and the new CBS will be on the airwaves.\n\nWhen the licenses for KCBS in Los Angeles, WCBS in New York and the other CBS-owned-and-operated stations are transferred, we’ll learn the long-term legacy of corporate capitulation. But for now, it remains too early to judge tomorrow’s newscasts. \n\nAs a scholar of broadcast journalism and a former broadcast journalist, I recommend evaluating programs like “60 Minutes” and the “CBS Evening News” on the record they will compile over the next three years – and the record they compiled over the past 50. The same goes for “ABC World News Tonight” and other ABC News programs. \n\nA major complicating factor for the Paramount-Skydance deal was the fact that “60 Minutes” has, over the past six months, broken major scoops embarrassing to the Trump administration, which led to additional scrutiny by its corporate ownership. Judged by its reporting in the first half of 2025, “60 Minutes” has upheld its record of critical and independent reporting in the public interest. \n\nIf audience members want to see ethical, independent and professional broadcast journalism that holds power to account, then it’s the audience’s responsibility to tune it in. The only way to learn the consequences of these settlements is by watching future programming rather than dismissing it beforehand. \n\nThe journalists working at ABC News and CBS News understand the legacy of their organizations, and they are also aware of how their owners have cast suspicion on the news divisions’ professionalism and credibility. As Dickerson asserted, they plan to “show up” regardless of the stain, and I’d bet they’re more motivated to redeem their reputations than we expect.\n\nI don’t think reporters, editors and producers plan to let Donald Trump become their editor-in-chief over the next three years. But we’ll only know by watching.","summary":"Will costly settlements over news stories the president sued about influence network journalists when deciding whether to pursue investigative stories involving the Trump administration?","url":"https://theconversation.com/abcs-and-cbss-settlements-with-trump-are-a-dangerous-step-toward-the-commander-in-chief-becoming-the-editor-in-chief-261006","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/679848/original/file-20250714-56-hdw2vd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C506%2C5904%2C2952&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 18:47:50","author":"Michael J.

COOPER and JACK BROOK\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Debate over President Donald Trump’s sweeping budget-and-policy package is over on Capitol Hill. Now the argument goes national.\n\nFrom the Central Valley of California to Midwestern battlegrounds and suburban districts of the northeast, the new law already is shaping the 2026 midterm battle for control of the House of Representatives. The outcome will set the tone for Trump’s final two years in the Oval Office.\n\nDemocrats need a net gain of three House seats to break the GOP’s chokehold on Washington and reestablish a power center to counter Trump. There’s added pressure to flip the House given that midterm Senate contests are concentrated in Republican-leaning states, making it harder for Democrats to reclaim that chamber.\n\nAs Republicans see it, they’ve now delivered broad tax cuts, an unprecedented investment in immigration enforcement and new restraints on social safety net programs. Democrats see a law that rolls back health insurance access and raises costs for middle-class Americans while cutting taxes mostly for the rich, curtailing green energy initiatives and restricting some workers’ organizing rights.\n\n“It represents the broken promise they made to the American people,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene, a Washington Democrat who chairs the party’s House campaign arm. “We’re going to continue to hold Republicans accountable for this vote.”\n\nParties gear up for a fight\n\nWhether voters see it that way will be determined on a district-by-district level, but the battle will be more intense in some places than others. Among the 435 House districts, only 69 contests were decided by less than 10 percentage points in the 2024 general election.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has so far identified 26 Democratic-held seats it must defend vigorously, along with 35 GOP-held seats it believes could be ripe to flip. Republicans’ campaign arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee, has so far listed 18 GOP incumbents as priorities, plus two districts opened by retirements.\n\nThere are a historically low number of so-called crossover districts: Only 13 Democrats represent districts Trump carried in 2024, while just three Republicans serve districts Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris carried.\n\nBoth committees are busy recruiting challengers and open-seat candidates and more retirements could come, so the competitive map will evolve. Still, there are clusters of districts guaranteed to influence the national result.\n\nCalifornia, despite its clear lean to Democrats statewide, has at least nine House districts expected to be up for grabs: three in the Central Valley and six in southern California. Six are held by Democrats, three by the GOP.\n\nPennsylvania features four districts that have been among the closest national House races for several consecutive cycles. They include a suburban Philadelphia seat represented by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, one of just two House Republicans to vote against Trump’s bill and one of the three GOP lawmakers from a district Harris won. Fitzpatrick cited the Medicaid cuts.\n\nVice President JD Vance plans on Wednesday to be in Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan’s northwest Pennsylvania district to tout the GOP package. Bresnahan’s seat is a top Democratic target.\n\nIowa and Wisconsin, meanwhile, feature four contiguous GOP-held districts in farm-heavy regions where voters could be swayed by fallout from Trump’s tariffs.\n\nDemocrats fight to define the GOP\n\nBeyond bumper-sticker labels — Trump’s preferred “Big Beautiful Bill” versus Democrats’ “Big Ugly Bill” retort — the 900-page law is, in fact, an array of policies with varying impact.\n\nDemocrats hammer Medicaid and food assistance cuts, some timed to take full effect only after the 2026 midterms, along with Republicans’ refusal to extend tax credits to some people who obtained health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law; 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.\n\n“Folks will die here in Louisiana and in other parts of the country,” House Minority Leader Jeffries warned last week during a town hall in Republican Speaker Mike Johnson’s home state of Louisiana.\n\nJeffries singled out vulnerable Republicans like California Rep. David Valadao, who represents a heavily agricultural Central Valley district where more than half the population is eligible for the joint state-federal insurance program. California allows immigrants with legal status and those who are undocumented to qualify for Medicaid, so not all Medicaid recipients are voters. But the program helps finance the overall health care system, including nursing homes and hospitals.\n\nRepublicans highlight the law’s tightened work requirements for Medicaid enrollees. They argue it’s a popular provision that will strengthen the program.\n\n“I voted for this bill because it does preserve the Medicaid program for its intended recipients — children, pregnant women, the disabled, and elderly,” Valadao said. “I know how important the program is for my constituents.”\n\nRepublicans hope voters see lower taxes\n\nThe law includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. It makes permanent existing rates and brackets approved during Trump’s first term. Republicans and their allies have hammered vulnerable Democrats for “raising costs” on American households by opposing the bill.\n\nGOP campaign aides point to the popularity of individual provisions: boosting the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200 (some families at lower income levels would not get the full credit), new deductions on tip and overtime income and auto loans; and a new deduction for older adults earning less than $75,000 a year.\n\n“Everyone will have more take home pay. They’ll have more jobs and opportunity,” Johnson said in a Fox News Sunday interview. “The economy will be doing better and we’ll be able to point to that as the obvious result of what we did.”\n\nDemocrats note that the biggest beneficiaries of Trump’s tax code are wealthy Americans and corporations. Pairing that with safety net cuts, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz concluded, “The cruelty is the point.”\n\nImmigration, meanwhile, was Trump’s strongest issue in 2024. NRCC aides say that will continue with the new law’s investments in immigration enforcement. Democrats believe the Trump administration has overplayed its hand with its push for mass deportation.\n\nPlaying the Trump card\n\nThe president is a titanic variable.\n\nDemocrats point to 2018, when they notched a 40-seat net gain in House seats to take control away from the GOP. This year, Democrats have enjoyed a double-digit swing in special elections around the country when compared to 2024 presidential results. Similar trends emerged in 2017 after Trump’s 2016 victory. Democrats say that reflects voter discontent with Trump once he’s actually in charge.\n\nRepublicans answer that Trump’s job approval remains higher at this point than in 2017. But the GOP’s effort is further complicated by ongoing realignments: Since Trump’s emergence, Democrats have gained affluent white voters -– like those in suburban swing districts -– while Trump has drawn more working-class voters across racial and ethnic groups. But Republicans face a stiffer challenge of replicating Trump’s coalition in a midterm election without him on the ballot.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, must corral voters who are not a threat to vote for Republicans but could stay home.\n\nJeffries said he’s determined not to let that happen: “We’re going to do everything we can until we end this national nightmare.”\n\nCooper reported from Phoenix.

Republicans and their allies have hammered vulnerable Democrats for “raising costs” on American households by opposing the bill.\n\nGOP campaign aides point to the popularity of individual provisions: boosting the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200 (some families at lower income levels would not get the full credit), new deductions on tip and overtime income and auto loans; and a new deduction for older adults earning less than $75,000 a year.\n\n“Everyone will have more take home pay. They’ll have more jobs and opportunity,” Johnson said in a Fox News Sunday interview. “The economy will be doing better and we’ll be able to point to that as the obvious result of what we did.”\n\nDemocrats note that the biggest beneficiaries of Trump’s tax code are wealthy Americans and corporations. Pairing that with safety net cuts, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz concluded, “The cruelty is the point.”\n\nImmigration, meanwhile, was Trump’s strongest issue in 2024. NRCC aides say that will continue with the new law’s investments in immigration enforcement. Democrats believe the Trump administration has overplayed its hand with its push for mass deportation.\n\nPlaying the Trump card\n\nThe president is a titanic variable.\n\nDemocrats point to 2018, when they notched a 40-seat net gain in House seats to take control away from the GOP. This year, Democrats have enjoyed a double-digit swing in special elections around the country when compared to 2024 presidential results. Similar trends emerged in 2017 after Trump’s 2016 victory. Democrats say that reflects voter discontent with Trump once he’s actually in charge.\n\nRepublicans answer that Trump’s job approval remains higher at this point than in 2017. But the GOP’s effort is further complicated by ongoing realignments: Since Trump’s emergence, Democrats have gained affluent white voters -– like those in suburban swing districts -– while Trump has drawn more working-class voters across racial and ethnic groups. But Republicans face a stiffer challenge of replicating Trump’s coalition in a midterm election without him on the ballot.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, must corral voters who are not a threat to vote for Republicans but could stay home.\n\nJeffries said he’s determined not to let that happen: “We’re going to do everything we can until we end this national nightmare.”\n\nCooper reported from Phoenix.

When these two forms of discrimination combine, as they have for the last 60 years and on hyperdrive for the last decade, they systematically cut most of the children of the Trump voter base out of any realistic prospect of access to higher education and corporate America,” Andreesseen wrote, according to the report.\n\n“They declared war on 70% of the country and now they’re going to pay the price.” \n\nThe rapid-fire blast of texts were sent to a WhatsApp group used by Trump officials to discuss AI policy with tech leaders and academics, according to the Washington Post.\n\nA White House official told the Washington Post that members of the Trump administration participated in the chat in a personal capacity, that no official policy was discussed and that Andreessen was not an official adviser to the president.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to The New York Post’s request for comment.\n\nAndreessen deleted many of the messages after sending them, according to screenshots and two members of the text chat who spoke to the newspaper.\n\nIn the group chat, Andreessen allegedly called for the National Science Foundation, an independent government agency that funds research, to receive “the bureaucratic death penalty.”\n\n“Raze it to the ground and start over,” He reportedly wrote. \n\nAndreessen claimed the agency had backed projects that censored American citizens online – taking a staunch free speech stance similar to Musk, who has loosened content restrictions on X and inspired similar moves from other tech leaders like Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg. \n\nHe also alleged Stanford had ousted his wife, Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, from her role as chair of the university’s philanthropy center.\n\n“[T]hey forced my wife out of Stanford without a second thought, a decision that will cost them something like $5 billion in future donations,” Andreessen wrote, according to the screenshots.\n\nRepresentatives for Andreessen Horowitz, Arrillaga-Andreessen and Stanford did not immediately respond to The Post’s requests for comment.\n\n“MIT is merit-based and affordable, driven by innovation and entrepreneurship, and committed to excellence,” a university spokesperson told The Post, adding that MIT admits applicants prior to learning their financial circumstances.\n\nSome members of the chat found Andreessen’s comments out of character for the group – which was often used to argue that a crackdown on immigration and attacks on universities could make it more difficult to attract and train top tech talent, the sources said.\n\nAndreessen argued that his “cohort of citizens” had once been willing to accept diversity policies as the cost of past bigotry in the US, “even though the discrimination was now aimed at us,” according to the text screenshots.\n\n“The insanity of the last 8 years and in particular the summer of 2020, totally shredded that complacency…And so now my people are furious and not going to take it anymore.”\n\nAndreessen stopped using the group chat soon after his messages in May, according to the report.\n\nThe group chat is moderated by Sriram Krishnan, a White House senior policy adviser on AI. He created the group before Trump’s second term, while he was working as a partner at Andreessen’s firm, according to the report.\n\nSome of the experts in the chat include Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist and NYU professor who supported Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign; and Fei-Fei Li, a Stanford professor and robotics entrepreneur who worked with the Biden administration on government funding for AI projects.\n\nThe group has recently debated the Trump administration’s budget cuts to the NSF and whether export curbs should be placed on Chinese AI firm DeepSeek, two members of the chat told the news outlet.\n\nThe tech industry has typically lobbied for research funding and high-skilled immigration policies, like permitting student visas. Andreessen has seemingly sided with Trump’s approach – targeting universities, criticizing DEI and affirmative action, slashing research funds and moving to cancel student visas.\n\nAndreessen has supported Democratic presidential candidates, including Hillary Clinton in 2016, as well as Republicans, like Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nHis firm endorsed Trump last July after the assassination attempt during a Butler, Pa. rally, arguing the Republican could help reverse harsh Biden-era policies that stifled tech advancements.\n\nAndreessen’s firm also financially backed Musk’s takeover of Twitter in 2022, saying it would encourage free speech.","summary":"It’s a stark reversal for the venture capitalist, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, who donated millions of dollars to Stanford University over the years.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/14/business/billionaire-trump-ally-marc-andreessen-warns-elite-universities-will-pay-the-price-for-dei/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/tech-billionaire-trump-adviser-marc-108158096.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 16:57:52","author":"Taylor Herzlich","authors":["Taylor Herzlich"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":341547150,"title":"Fox News Trump Interview Resurfaces With Edited Answer on Epstein Files: ‘Kamala Should Sue’","text":"A resurfaced clip from a Fox News interview with President Trump in 2024 has social media users calling for former Vice President Kamala Harris to follow Trump’s lead and sue over election interference.\n\nThe Trump administration has come under heavy fire over the last week, following the Justice Department’s announcement that it does not have a “client list” in its Jeffrey Epstein files. The announcement contradicted comments made by Trump attorney general Pam Bondi, who told Fox News in February that she had the long-rumored Epstein list sitting on her desk. MAGA supporters have called out Trump for failing to follow through on a campaign promise to release the files.\n\nNow, a clip from a Fox News interview with Trump last year has resurfaced. In the edited version, shared by both Fox News and Trump’s supporters online, Trump is asked whether he would declassify the Epstein files and succinctly replies, “Yeah, yeah, I would.” \n\nHowever, in the unedited version, which is going viral on social media, Trump says, “Yeah, yeah, I would. I guess I would. I think that less so, because you don’t know — you don’t want to affect people’s lives if it’s phony stuff in there, because it’s a lot of phony stuff with that whole world. But I think I would.” You can check out the clip yourself in the video below.\n\nI had not seen this Fox News extended interview with Trump from 2024 — where they deliberately edited his Epstein answer — where he won’t commit to releasing the full files because of “phony” stuff in it. pic.twitter.com/RQZhqP4oUs— Andrew Kaczynski (@KFILE) July 14, 2025\n\nThe resurfaced, unedited version has sparked cries of hypocrisy, as Trump successfully sued CBS for airing an edited version of an interview with his 2024 presidential opponent. Last year, CBS shared a version of an interview with Harris that edited down one of the Vice President’s rambling answers into a succinct, confident response to the question at hand. \n\nTrump sued CBS for election interference, which led to an early July settlement with CBS News parent company Paramount for $16 million. Now, the unedited version of Fox News’ Trump interview has social media users online proclaiming, “Kamala should sue.” Semafor political reporter David Weigel reshared the clip and wrote on X, “As edits for broadcast go, this clearly did more good for Trump than the ’60 Minutes’ cut did for Harris.”\n\nFox did, notably, air the longer, unedited version of Trump’s Epstein response on “FOX & Friends” on June 3, 2024, and the interview itself was played in audio form on “The Will Cain Show.” At the time, Cain commented, “Portions of that interview have aired over the weekend on ‘FOX & Friends,’ as is the nature of TV. What was an hour and 20 something odd minute interview has to be reduced into 10 minute segments. From the beginning I said, ‘But I want the whole thing. I want the whole thing for ‘The Will Cain Show.’”\n\n“In the middle of that interview Donald Trump said more time let’s give it more time. In that interview he said let it run, I know you can’t, I know you’re not in charge of it, but let it run from start to finish,” the Fox anchor added. “I agree with him. You deserve context, you deserve to hear the entirety of the conversation. So we have the opportunity today here, uniquely, exclusively to hear the entire interview with Donald Trump. I think it is the fullest context you can get.”\n\nThe social media outcry over the interview comes as Trump continues to receive pushback over his administration’s handling of the Epstein files. On Monday, “Morning Joe” co-host Jonathan Lemire told viewers, “This is a rare moment, a very rare moment, where there is a real fracture in the president’s base.”","summary":"\"I guess I would,\" Trump says when asked in the 2024 interview if he would declassify the government's Epstein files\n\n\nThe post Fox News Trump Interview Resurfaces With Edited Answer on Epstein Files: &#8216;Kamala Should Sue&#8217; appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/fox-news-trump-interview-resurfaces-edited-answer-epstein-files/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Donald-Trump-6-25-25.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 16:49:13","author":"Alex Welch","authors":["Alex Welch"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.544},{"id":341521372,"title":"Barack Obama Asks Democrats To “Toughen Up” And “Do Something” In Latest Message","text":"Former US President Barack Obama has delivered a strong message to Democrats, urging them to stop whining and start taking a stand. He issued this call to action at a private fundraiser held in New Jersey last week.\nThe Democrats faced a disappointing loss in the 2024 presidential election, as Republican candidate Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris. Over the past few months, the Trump administration has announced several decisions that have frustrated Democrats and contradicted their political values.\nIn his speech on Friday, the former President encouraged Democrats to stand up for their principles and for what they believe is right for the progress of the country. He also urged them to complain less and take more action.\n“I think it’s going to require a little bit less navel-gazing and a little less whining and being in fetal positions. And it’s going to require Democrats to just toughen up,” Obama said, as reported by CNN.\nAfter their loss in the presidential election, Democrats are now seeking ways to move forward. Currently, the party is focused on campaigning for their candidates in the upcoming gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia. Offering his support, Obama said, “Stop looking for the quick fix. Stop looking for the messiah. You have great candidates running races right now. Support those candidates.”\nThe New Jersey fundraiser was hosted by Governor Phil Murphy and Tammy Murphy at their residence in Red Bank. The event raised $2.5 million in donations for the Democratic National Committee, according to an insider source cited by CNN.\nIn his speech, Obama also addressed internal divisions within the party, urging supporters to remain committed to delivering results and improving people’s lives. “You’ve got to figure out how to do it,” he said.\nObama also expressed hope that Democrats can return to power. “If we do our jobs over the next year and a half, then I think we will rebuild momentum,” he said.\nThe recent fundraiser marked one of the few occasions where Obama directly criticised Trump and his policies. While he has previously spoken out against Trump’s tariff policies and warned of the country’s drift toward autocracy, he has generally been selective in his comments on the current president.","summary":"His recent call to action came at a private fundraiser event in New Jersey last week.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/barack-obama-asks-democrats-to-toughen-up-and-do-something-in-latest-message-ws-l-9440526.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-design-2025-05-31T141753.642-2025-05-41fbc126e35e02159cbbe95691a34d23.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 16:48:35","author":"Mayur Borah,News18,World Desk","authors":["Mayur Borah","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.013},{"id":341529312,"title":"'Illegal interference': Resurfaced Fox News clip shows network 'deliberately edited' Trump","text":"On July 1, CBS News' parent company, Paramount, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit from President Donald Trump —who claimed that CBS edited a 2024 interview with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in a way that amount to election interference.

The Republican leader will fly to his mother's ancestral homeland on a private trip which is likely to be centred around his two luxury golf resorts in Aberdeenshire and South Ayrshire. Trump is expected to formally open a second course, named after his late mother Mary , at the Menie Estate in the north-east. The President is also expected to spend time at the five-star Turnberry hotel and golf links in Ayrshire. It was announced today the New Yorker will also hold meetings with Swinney and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Dates and venues for the events have not yet been confirmed. A Scottish Government spokeswoman said it had been working \"collaboratively on arrangements with partners including Police Scotland on the visit of the President of the United States\". They added: \"There are plans for the First Minister to meet with the President when he is in Scotland. It is important that the opportunity to promote the interests of Scotland is taken during this visit.\" Trump previously had an introductory phone call with Swinney in December last year following his reelection as US President. The pair were said to have discussed the \"social, cultural and economic ties\" between Scotland and America. The call happened just weeks after the SNP leader told journalists at the Scottish Parliament he was hoping Kamala Harris would win November's presidential election. Swinney's remark was later branded \"nasty\" by Eric Trump, the President's second son. He said his father was \"not going to lose any sleep over” over the comment and said \"I’m not sure it bothers him one bit\". He said: \"I mean, obviously [Swinney] read the temperature very wrong. He got it wrong. He got it very wrong because my father won decisively. “And so, you know, endorsing a person three days before an election in a different country, and missing the mark by as much as it was missed by, you know, he read the tea leaves incorrectly.” But relations between the pair were patched up in March this year when Eric Trump had a \"warm and friendly\" meeting with the First Minister at Bute House. The businessman said they \"did not discuss Scottish or US politics but concentrated on golf.\" Swinney's planned meeting with the President is likely to face opposition from some members of the Scottish Parliament. Green MSP Ross Greer, who is running to become his party's new co-leader, said: \"I doubt the First Minister would meet with Putin or Netanyahu. \"What is the distinction between them and Trump other than economic power and how do we think history will judge those who tried to treat him like just another world leader?\" Swinney previously defended speaking with Trump following criticism from the Scottish Greens.

Hunger and homelessness have run rampant in Gaza since Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis and took 251 more as hostages on Oct. 7, 2023, after which Israel launched a war on the terrorist group that has resulted in the deaths of more than 58,000 people, according to Reuters.\n\n“there are no words to describe the heartbreak I feel witnessing the devastation that is being inflicted upon innocent people in Palestine,” Rodrigo began. “mothers, fathers and children in Gaza are starving, dehydrated and being denied access to basic medical care and humanitarian aid.”\n\n“there is no child in Israel, Palestine or anywhere in the world who deserves to suffer through what we’re seeing these children have to endure,” she continued. “it is horrific and completely unacceptable. to give up on them is to give up on our shared humanity.”\n\nThe Grammy winner went on to share that she has donated to Unicef to “help support the victims of this horrifying situation,” adding that she encourages followers “to do the same if you have the means.”\n\nRodrigo is just the latest artist to speak up about the violence in Gaza. In recent weeks, Lana Del Rey has said that she prays for Palestine “every day,” while Billie Eilish disavowed Israel’s plan to forcibly relocate about 2 million Palestinians to a “humanitarian city” built on the ruins of Rafah, calling the concept “horrifying.”\n\nThe High School Musical: The Musical: The Series alum has also long been outspoken when it comes to her beliefs, from endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election to using her shows to protest attacks on reproductive freedom. In February last year, Rodrigo launched her Fund 4 Good, which raises money for abortion funds across the globe — an undertaking that led Planned Parenthood to honor her with a Catalyst for Change award at the organization’s spring gala in April. \n\n“We live in a world that politicizes our bodies and uses harmful ideologies to deny us safety and healthcare,” Rodrigo said during her speech at the event. “My greatest wish is that through organizations like Planned Parenthood and the action of everyday citizens, no woman will need to sacrifice her dreams, her health or humanity because of restrictive laws or lack of resources.”\n\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\n\nWant to know what everyone in the music business is talking about?\n\nGet in the know on\n\nVisit Billboard Pro for music business news\n\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

One of the well-known characters from that series is Ron Swanson.\n\nStanding out as perhaps the most notable figure in Pawnee, Swanson became known for his passionate leadership and views the government as something that is a work in progress.\n\nNick Offerman’s commentary on his character\n\nRecently, Nick Offerman, who portrays Swanson on Parks and Recreation, spoke with IndieWire on his thoughts regarding people who believe that his character is a Trump supporter. Because of this, he was quick to point out reasonable facts about how this is false and what Swanson stands for politically. \n\n“Dumb people insist that Ron Swanson would’ve voted for Trump. And I don’t deign to answer myself,” Offerman said. “I take it to Mike Schur, the main creator of Ron, and he said, ‘Swanson would’ve despised Trump, because Ron loved capitalism. And Trump made the stupidest move you could make as a capitalist, which is to go into public service.’”\n\nOn the show, Swanson had a strong belief in implementing a small government, and even wanted citizens to have independent liberty, meaning that he was all about the state of being free and exercising the rights that were given to society. However, Offerman knew that someone like Swanson wouldn’t vote for Trump, mainly due to how he further disrupts democracy and isn’t fully aware of how to run for office.\n\n“He would think he’s an absolute idiot,” Offerman continued about Ron’s thoughts on Trump. “He would also despise him because he’s disrespectful to women and many others. And that’s just an example of all the people and value sets that Ron would despise, because Ron is a good person.”\n\nOfferman shares many similarities with Swanson\n\nIn his own life, Offerman has been known to be outspoken in terms of his political views. Leading up to the 2024 Presidential Election, he released a politically-charged song that explored his pride in supporting Kamala Harris and throwing jokes at President Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Trump supporters. \n\n“So, I’m proud to be on Kamala’s side, where I know I’ll never see some spray-tanned tool denying her ethnic identity,” he sang. The song received massive support from Parks and Recreation fans and Harris supporters alike. \n\nEarlier this year, Offerman won an award at the Independent Spirit Award for his role in the HBO series The Last of Us. His character Bill became the target of anti-gay hate, which Offerman took the time to speak about in his acceptance speech. \n\nOfferman stated, “Stories with guts, that when homophobic hate comes my way and says, ‘Why did you have to make it a gay story?’ We say, ‘Because you ask questions like that.’ It’s not a gay story. It’s a love story, you asshole.”\n\nSpoken like a true king.\n\nSocial media chimes in on Offerman’s commentary\n\nRedditors provided their detailed opinions on why some believe Ron Swanson would be considered a Trump supporter. \n\nOne user wrote, ”It baffles me how people misread this character.

Andrew Cuomo.\n\nMoreover, the 33 year old state Assemblyman was carried to victory by an extremely diverse coalition, winning Asian voters (+15), Hispanic voters (+6), and White voters (+5) according to an analysis by the New York Times.\n\nSimilarly, the winning formula behind Mamdani’s campaign – savvy use of social media – is not particularly hard for other progressive candidates to replicate.\n\nAll of this has emboldened progressives across the country.\n\nCommon Sense, a progressive news outlet, has declared that Mamdani’s win proves the need for Democrats to welcome the rise of socialists within the party and the start of a total shakeup of the party to give more influence to the far-left.\n\nConversely, there are reasons to believe that, rather than underscoring the dominance and appeal of progressives, Mamdani’s victory could simply be chalked up to a perfect storm of circumstances that are not present in other elections.\n\nMamdani’s top challenger, Cuomo, had spent a decade as governor of New York and was seen as the establishment candidate at a time when 69% of voters say the Democratic establishment is “out of touch” per Washington Post polling.\n\nFurther, New York City itself is idiosyncratic, giving Mamdani a base that may not exist, at least to this scale, elsewhere.\n\nNew York City Democratic primary voters tend to be considerably further to the political left than one would see in other states or on the national level, including a heavy concentration of young, college-educated, and progressive voters.\n\nAccording to a post-election survey from SurveyUSA, “very liberal” voters (32%) made up the biggest share of primary voters. \n\nThis compares to data from Gallup which indicates that less 1-in-10 (9%) voters nationwide consider themselves “very liberal.”\n\nPut another way, it’s difficult to imagine Mamdani’s self-described Democratic Socialist agenda being received as well in purple districts in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, or Georgia.\n\nIn that same vein, assuming Mamdani wins the general election, how he governs will severely impact the fortunes of progressives across the country. \n\nIf his more extreme policies cause the city financial distress, capital flight, or a breakdown in public safety, any enthusiasm he’s generated thus far for progressive leadership will rapidly evaporate.\n\nOf course, the flip side is that if anger towards the Trump administration grows over issues like deportations, tariffs, or other executive overreach, it may further embolden progressives. \n\nOr, given the far-left’s tendency to be the most vocal contingent of the Democratic Party, and the most willing to voice opposition to Trump, it may make their candidates look more appealing to Americans turned off by the administration. \n\nThe second question that arises from Mamdani’s win is whether it translates into renewed strength for progressives in California, or even the possibility of a far-left candidate making their mark on the upcoming gubernatorial election.\n\nAs the biggest solidly blue state in the country, California politics are often further to the left of other states, but in recent years, progressives have seen their influence wane.\n\nHowever, progressives there are viewing Mamdani’s win as a “harbinger” of things to come, according to a recent Politico article. \n\nAnd yet, there are signs that Californians may not be ready to return to progressive governance.\n\nConsider San Francisco, a former bastion of the state’s far-left. Just three years ago, voters recalled District Attorney Chesa Boudin, amid mounting exhaustion with progressive criminal justice policies. Then last year, the city elected centrist Democrat Daniel Lurie as mayor, doubling down on a shift towards the center and away from progressive candidates.\n\nAt the same time, the 2024 election showed a considerable shift to the right among California voters. \n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris’ 20-point margin of victory over President Trump was the smallest for a Democrat since 2004, and Trump flipped 10 counties that had voted for former President Biden in 2020.\n\nThe state’s voters also passed Prop 36, reinstituting tough-on-crime laws.\n\nWith that in mind, is it possible that a reinvigorated progressive wing will impact the gubernatorial election?\n\nThe former VP leads most polls, including a recent UC Irvine survey showing her 15-points ahead of 2nd place Rick Caruso (24% to 9%). \n\nBut, if Harris does not run – she has yet to decide – the race could theoretically be wide open for a progressive candidate.\n\nUltimately, the Democratic Party remains at a crossroads, caught between the growing influence of the far-left, and the more politically viable moderate wing. \n\nWhether or not Mamdani’s victory heralds a new era of a progressive-dominated Democratic Party remains to be seen, but it is far too early to declare a widespread desire for similar candidates. \n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"Douglas Schoen- New York City moves left, California moves right","url":"https://www.presstelegram.com/2025/07/13/douglas-schoen-new-york-city-moves-left-california-moves-right/","image":"https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25183592584242.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 14:33:15","author":"Gqlshare","authors":["Gqlshare"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.066},{"id":341501822,"title":"Young Democrat wants cognitive tests for aging members of Congress","text":"A young Democrat in the House has proposed a radical idea to deal with Congress’ age problem, Axios reports. \n\nRep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA) is a two-term Democrat who won a district that Trump won twice - and has heard from voters about the age of lawmakers.\n\n“What I've heard from my neighbors, my community is this idea that this place is being run by a bunch of staffers,” the 36-year-old told Axios. “And we're seeing a very real decline in confidence in Congress.”\n\nIn response, Gluesenkamp Perez proposed an amendment to the appropriations bill to that sets aside money for congressional operations to require the Office of Congressional Conduct create a standard to assess members’ “ability to perform the duties of office unimpeded by significant irreversible cognitive impairment.” \n\nSuch an assessment could lead to investigations into whether a member is mentally incapacitated to the point that their service damages Congress’s credibility. \n\nThe amendment failed to pass during a markup, with subcommittee chairman David Valadao (R-CA) saying “a lot of concern with some of our colleagues sometimes when we see some of their comments,” but that elections are the proper barometer. \n\nBut Gluesenkamp Perez told Axios that “It's not a comfortable thing to think about time being irreversible and how our lives change, but ... real respect for our communities and the body here is [being] willing to have these honest, candid and difficult conversations.”\n\nCongress, particularly Democrats, have dealt with questions about whether senior lawmakers can continue to do the job. Last year, Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) became the top Democrat on the House Oversight & Accountability Committee and died earlier this year after a diagnosis of esophageal cancer. \n\nRep. Sylvester Turner (D-TX), a freshman Democrat, died in March shortly after President Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress. Turner was 70 and had a history with cancer. \n\nIn addition, earlier this year, Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ) died after a long battle with cancer. Grijalva had missed most votes in the House of Representatives last year.\n\nLast Congress, the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein died in office at age 89 after she had faced multiple questions about her mental fitness to do the job.\n\nPerhaps the most pressing example came when former president Joe Biden had his disastrous sole debate with Trump in June of last year, where he sounded frail, stumbled over his words and often trailed off mid-sentence. Biden, who was 81 at the time, stepped aside less than a month after the debate and his vice president Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee for president and later lost to Trump. \n\nOther Democrats such as Rep. David Scott (D-GA) and Del. Eleanor Holmes, Washington, D.C.’s nonvoting delegate in Congress, have also raised questions about their mental fitness.","summary":"Despite Marie Gluesenkamp Perez’s amendment failing, she wants to have a tough conversation about older members of Congress","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/mgp-democrat-cognitive-test-congress-members-b2788627.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/14/13/00/GettyImages-2174514335.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/SzLnxNFZ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-14 14:26:26","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.361},{"id":341474774,"title":"YouTube minting billions off pirated videos placed next to ads for Trump, GM and more, bombshell report reveals: ‘They’re letting it happen’","text":"YouTube places flagrantly pirated videos next to ads for politicians including President Trump, as well as corporate giants like JPMorgan, General Motors and Pizza Hut, according to a bombshell report – and insiders claim Google is turning a blind eye to the shenanigans as it rakes in billions in ad dollars.\n\nLast September, YouTube ran a Trump National Committee ad before what looked like a pirated version of the Tom Cruise blockbuster “Top Gun: Maverick.”\n\n Last month, an ad for Procter & Gamble’s Olay body wash ran alongside an apparently pirated Russian-language version of Netflix’s “Squid Game,” according to the report.\n\nElsewhere, ads for Pizza Hut and General Motors ran alongside a pirated Spanish-language version of the 2025 movie “Sinners,” according to screenshots included in a 300-page report compiled by Adalytics, a research firm that partners with Fortune 500 companies.\n\nThe latter were later removed to a copyright request by Warner Bros, and the other two were eventually taken down over copyright claims. \n\nNevertheless, YouTube scarcely ever gives refunds to brands after it removes videos that violate its own policies, media buyers and advertising executives told The Post.\n\n“They’re letting it happen,” said Erich Garcia, a longtime marketing executive. “It’s because they are financially benefiting from this. They are pocketing the money and continuing on.”\n\nGarcia said he raised the issue directly with YouTube in early 2023 after noticing bizarre trends while serving as head of paid media at Quote.com.\n\n“I would see these really random YouTube channels, typically foreign language with very small viewership, all of a sudden — in the course of like 20 minutes — rack up thousands of dollars of spend,” Garcia said.\n\nThese weren’t isolated, one-off incidents. Garcia said as much as 50% of Quote’s ad spending during a given period would show up in YouTube’s reports marked “Total: other” — indicating that the channels where the ads had run had been removed while failing to identify them.\n\nEventually, Garcia gave a presentation to YouTube staffers, a copy of which was viewed by The Post, which showed that nearly $300,000 — or more than 40% — of Quote’s spending, was unaccounted for in YouTube’s reports. \n\nHe said Google representatives later provided him with a $50,000 account credit, though they didn’t admit it was because of the issues he’d flagged.\n\nMeanwhile, Adalytics captured video in which Trump campaign ads ran alongside multiple pirated broadcasts of college football games, including a matchup between the Colorado Buffaloes and the Colorado State Rams last fall. \n\nThat video was later removed after the account was “terminated,” according to YouTube.\n\nA YouTube spokesperson said the Trump campaign ads flagged in the Adalytics report ran on videos that were correctly identified by YouTube’s “Content ID,” a safety tool that scans for copyright-related infractions, and removed from the platform. The channels responsible for the violations were banned.\n\n“When we become aware of channels that repeatedly upload content they don’t own, we terminate the channel, and if ads were running on this content, we credit the advertiser,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nContent ID flagged more than 2.2 billion videos in 2024 alone, the company said. In more than 90% of cases, rightsholders opted to keep their content on YouTube in exchange for receiving ad revenue.\n\nWhen possible, YouTube provides credits to advertisers whose ads ran on channels that violated its policies, the company said.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. The Republican National Committee did not return a request for comment.\n\nKamala Harris’s campaign encountered similar issues, as did major corporate brands like NBCUniversal, US Bank, T-Mobile and many others, according to Adalytics.\n\nAdvertisers have been up in arms about ads running against illicit YouTube videos for at least a decade. In 2015, ads for big corporate brands like Toyota and Anheuser-Busch ran alongside videos of ISIS beheadings. \n\nIn 2017, Lyft pulled advertisers off YouTube after its commercials ran on a white supremacist group’s channel.\n\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post’s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between.

The platform raked in a whopping $36.1 billion in revenue from digital ads in 2024 – including its first-ever $10 billion quarter in the last three months of the year.\n\nWhile YouTube sends placement reports about their ad campaigns, sources say the reports are vague and difficult to parse. Some campaigns can have thousands or even millions of entries logged in a spreadsheet, making performance analysis nearly impossible for smaller businesses.\n\n“They have controls in place, but it appears that they don’t work as well as they say they do,” said one ad executive who asked not to be named. “It is a very complicated ecosystem that they’ve set up. And it can make it seem as though an advertiser, large or small, is buying in an open exchange where you can end up on channels or videos with unsafe, inflammatory, or foreign-owned content.” \n\nThe industry veterans said YouTube videos that get taken down show up in Google reports in a category titled “total: other.” The reports give no details on when or why the videos were removed, leaving advertisers at a loss to explain how their money was spent.\n\nOne media buyer said it was “utterly impossible” to get a full understanding of how and where brand ads were running on YouTube.\n\n“You can’t know for certain what was what,” the buyer said. “You can’t get much transparency into things that were removed.”\n\nTo vet YouTube’s refund policy, a second media buyer performed a test in which ads were specifically marked to run in channels that the buyer knew had been running pirated videos. YouTube removed the videos, but didn’t give a refund, according to a copy of a YouTube report viewed by The Post.\n\n“Why are they not giving a refund for that? If it was not good enough for their policies, but it’s good enough for you to take the advertiser’s money?” the second media buyer said. “it seems like they’re really focused on the monetization aspect and not so much on the success of campaigns for advertisers.”\n\nYouTube pushed back on assertions that its placement reports are too vague and said it encourages advertisers to contact their account managers if they have questions about receiving “make good” credits.\n\nEarlier this year, a US federal judge ruled that Google operates two illegal monopolies related to digital advertising. The Justice Department is pushing for a breakup of the company to restore competition.\n\nCritics have argued that a lack of competition has allowed Google to skate by without meaningful product and safety improvements.\n\nFor now, Garcia said advertisers have little choice but to eat their losses and continue working with YouTube due to its massive audience.\n\n“It’s like ‘kiss the ring,’” Garcia said. “Where are you gonna go? There is no competition to YouTube.”","summary":"YouTube places flagrantly pirated videos next to ads for politicians including President Trump, as well as corporate giants like JPMorgan, General Motors and Pizza Hut, according to a bombshell report – and insiders claim Google is turning a blind eye to the shenanigans as it rakes in billions in ad dollars.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/14/business/youtube-is-minting-billions-off-pirated-videos-placed-next-to-ads-for-trump-gm-jpmorgan-and-pizza-hut/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/newspress-collage-hmxeuqv7g-1752500826535.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1752486496&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 13:49:32","author":"Thomas Barrabi","authors":["Thomas Barrabi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.576},{"id":341458562,"title":"Straight-shooting advisor George Steffes always had Reagan's ear","text":"If there were more people like George Steffes in politics, the public wouldn’t hold the institution in such low esteem. There’d be a lot less bull and much more thoughtful debate. Paralytic polarization would give way to problem solving. Steffes was the kind of person who people profess to want in the halls of government power. If more Republicans like him were in Washington, there’d be no rationalization for tyrannical ICE raids at schools and workplaces because Congress and the president would have long ago compromised on immigration reform. The Republican Party would still be modeled after Steffes’ early mentor — pragmatic conservative Ronald Reagan — and not be the misused tool of demagogue Donald Trump. Steffes, 90, died peacefully in his sleep in a Sacramento hospital July 6. He was admitted two weeks earlier after a painful bathroom fall. The precise cause of death was unknown at this writing, according to his wife, Jamie Khan. He was the last remaining top advisor of Gov. Reagan who remained in Sacramento after the future president moved on — the last person around the state Capitol with firsthand, close-up knowledge of the GOP icon’s governorship. He was Reagan’s lead legislative lobbyist. Ordinarily, Steffes would be best known around the Capitol for being a past Reagan honcho. But he’s better known for being a classy guy. No one in Sacramento for the last 60 years — at least — has been more liked, respected and successful as a lobbyist than Steffes. He’d easily rank in the top 10. No, make that top 5. If there were more lobbyists like Steffes, the profession wouldn’t be such a pejorative. He didn’t try to BS governors, legislators, clients or journalists. He was a straight shooter. People trusted him. He always had a smile, but wasn’t a backslapper. People instantly liked him — as I did when we first met in a Santa Cruz hotel bar one night in 1966 after a day of traipsing after Reagan running for governor. Steffes was a campaign aide. I was a reporter who found him highly interesting, thoughtful and candid. But don’t take just my word about the guy. “He was never part of the nonsense that is characteristic of those of us in politics,” former Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown told me. “I could rely on his word about good public policy. He was knowledgeable. He knew what he was doing.” Brown, who was elected San Francisco mayor after leaving the Legislature, recalled that Steffes helped him pass a landmark bill “eliminating a law punishing people for being gay. I had to get Republican votes. George talked to them about how it wasn’t a bad vote to cast.” The 1975 bill, signed by new Gov. Jerry Brown, repealed a century-old law prohibiting “crimes against nature.” The measure eliminated criminal penalties for oral sex and sodomy between consenting adults. “The biggest thing that stands out to me about Steffes is how different he was from the mean-spirited slashing politics of today,” says Kip Lipper, a chief environmental consultant for several Democratic state Senate leaders. “He was unfailingly considerate, always in good spirits. He didn’t wear his politics on his sleeve like a lot of others.” Retired journalist Lou Cannon, who has written several Reagan biographies, recalls that after the new Republican governor took office in 1967, he continued to bash Pat Brown, the Democratic incumbent he had trounced the previous year. “George told him, ‘Governor, that ‘s not worthy of you.’ So Reagan stopped. And he actually became quite fond of Pat Brown. George was never afraid to say to Reagan that he was wrong about something. And Reagan appreciated that.” If only we had some White House aides with that courage and wisdom today. Cannon adds: “One of the reasons I liked George is he didn’t bulls— you. If he couldn’t tell you something, he’d tell you he couldn’t tell ya. He was straight. Some people you interview them and you think, ‘Why did I waste my time?’” Public relations veteran Donna Lucas says, “He set the standard for good lobbying in the Capitol.” One Steffes rule: “He would never ask a legislator to do anything that wasn’t in their interest as well,” says Jud Clark, a former legislative staffer for Democrats and a close friend and business associate of Steffes. Before he retired a few years ago, Steffes had a very long A-list of clients, such as American Express, Bechtel, IBM, Exxon and Union Pacific. He also represented less lucrative clients such as newspapers, including The Times. And he advocated for some interests pro bono, mostly golf associations. His passion was golf. And he became a golf instructor after retiring from lobbying. “George was such a cerebral teacher,” says a pupil, Capitol Weekly editor Rich Ehisen. “He didn’t spend a lot of time correcting your elbow bend. He focused on the mental part of the game.” Steffes once told an interviewer: “Golf offered good lessons for life. If I had a bad stroke, I can’t fix it now. It’s in the past. … Sitting and stewing [about it] saps our mental energy. Focus on what you can do to move forward, win the issue.” But Steffes did stew about the declining state of politics. “Politics became too polarized — Republican conservatives, Democratic liberals. The middle ground where he used to operate was disappearing,” his wife, Jamie, told me last week. Reagan’s GOP that formed Steffes’ philosophy of political pragmatism had already disappeared. In the last election, he voted for Democrat Kamala Harris over Republican nominee Trump. Steffes was honest even with himself — a human quality possessed by too few in politics.

Tim Walz regaled about a thousand people at a South Dakota Democratic Party fundraiser Saturday night with jabs at the state’s former and current governors, advice for winning back rural voters and blue collar workers, and pride in liberal ideals.\n\nThe 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee — who was on the losing ticket with presidential nominee Kamala Harris — delivered the keynote speech to a sellout crowd at the 2025 McGovern Day dinner at the Sioux Falls Convention Center. Reporters were allowed into the event, but not to take photographs once it started.\n\nIt didn’t take long for Walz to criticize the actions of U.S. Homeland Security secretary and Republican former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem.\n\n“If you had to pick somebody who’s the antithesis of the South Dakota I know, it would be that,” he said.\n\nThe two served in Congress, cosponsoring bills together before 2018, when each was elected to lead their respective states.\n\nTheir relationship soured during the COVID-19 pandemic when they took divergent approaches, and further deteriorated when Noem described Walz as a “radical” in her role as a Trump surrogate during last year’s presidential campaign.\n\nWalz, speaking of his preparation to appear in South Dakota, said “I had to decide what I was going to wear.”\n\n“When you’re a governor and you’re in South Dakota, do you dress as a fireman? You dress as a cowgirl?” he said.\n\nThe joke was a dig at Noem. She donned firefighting gear at a U.S. Coast Guard training facility, for example, and wore a cowboy hat for an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\n“I know it’s petty, but some people just bring out the petty,” Walz said.\n\nAdvice for SD Democrats\n\nHe laid out his connections to South Dakota once the laughter died down. He grew up nearby in Nebraska. He hunted pheasants in Winner, saw drive-in movies in Lake Andes and “spent too much time” at a bar called the Longbranch in Burke.\n\nWalz also prodded current South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden, who recently signed a bill that will allow the concealed carry of pistols on college campuses by gun owners with enhanced permits. Walz described that as one of the Republican talking points about South Dakota being “the freest state in the nation.”\n\nFrom a Minnesota classroom to potential VP: Meet Gov. Tim Walz\n\n“I think some of you may have a difference of opinion in that. I ran into an OB-GYN that says that’s not true,” Walz said, referencing South Dakota’s near-total abortion ban.\n\nWalz told Democrats that Republicans who paint them as “elites” are cutting taxes for the wealthy and reducing support for student aid programs and Medicaid while “tearing apart” rural communities and mass-detaining undocumented immigrants.\n\n“Is our immigration system broken? Yes. But our moral system sure as hell should not be with throwing people in camps,” he said, a reference to a detention center for migrants in the Florida Everglades that President Trump calls “Alligator Alcatraz.”\n\n“The people building prison camps are never the good guys in history,” Walz said.\n\nHe urged Democrats to work on issues of importance to rural and working class South Dakotans, like Medicaid and Medicare, and to work with labor unions.\n\n“There’s a direct correlation between the strength of the middle class and economic security with the number of people who are in labor unions,” he said.\n\nHe also suggested the national Democratic Party should pay more attention to places like South Dakota if it expects to build a coalition durable enough to compete outside of its traditional strongholds and battleground states. “A few million dollars” could make a difference and help South Dakota build the Democratic bench, he said.\n\n“I hear people say ‘there are no Democrats in South Dakota,’” Walz said. “But there’s a hell of a lot in this room.”\n\nParty expects more candidates in 2026\n\nThe McGovern Day dinner is the state party’s largest annual fundraiser. Regular tickets cost $125. Meet-and-greet tickets cost twice that.\n\n“We haven’t had a McGovern Day dinner this big at least since I’ve been around,” said Shane Merrill, chair of the state party.\n\nThe party leaned into Walz’s fame for more than ticket sales. Vermillion brewery XIX whipped up a batch of “Walz on Tap” blonde ale, sold by the can at cocktail stations and by the four-pack in a silent auction.\n\nThe enthusiasm was tempered by reality. South Dakotans registered as independents or without any political affiliation outnumber Democrats. Republicans have the most registrants and hold every statewide office, all three of the state’s congressional seats, and all but nine of the seats in the 105-member Legislature.\n\nDemocrats have faced criticism during recent South Dakota election cycles for not fielding candidates, sometimes for offices as high as Congress. Before the speeches started Saturday, state party Executive Director Dan Ahlers said that won’t be a problem in 2026.\n\n“I need two of me to interview all the people who want to run,” he said.\n\nThe party already has candidates for U.S. Senate (Julian Beaudion), secretary of state (Terrence Davis) and U.S. representative, although Ahlers said that candidate won’t announce until the fall. Nineteen-year-old Robert Arnold has announced his candidacy for governor, and Ahlers said he expects another hopeful to announce for that race, as well.\n\nLater, speaking from the stage, Ahlers declared “we can no longer be content with a few seats at the table. We need to run the table.”\n\n“It shouldn’t be enough to field a good Democratic candidate,” he said. “We need to elect Democratic candidates.”\n\nState Sen. Liz Larson, D-Sioux Falls, said she’s proud to have been the first female state Senate minority leader, but told the audience that it took time to get there. She lost in her first run for office in 2020, but “knocked on thousands of doors” and won on her second and third go-rounds.\n\nDemocrats believe, she said, “that you’re no better than anybody else, and we’re all in this together.”\n\n“That is a politics worth showing up for,” Larson said.\n\nSouth Dakota Searchlight is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

For the uninitiated, Nicki Minaj recently posted several tweets criticizing Jay-Z and Desiree Perez (Roc Nation's CEO).In one post, dated July 8, she claimed that she had a \"karmic debt\" to settle with the Empire State of Mind rapper regarding Tidal, a streaming platform he co-founded in 2015. In another X post, she also alluded to Rymir Satterthwaite's ongoing paternity lawsuit against Jay-Z.During the episode of The Adam & Wack Show, Wack 100 explained his thoughts about the conflict between the two rappers. He added that he believed Nicki Minaj was intentionally picking a fight with Jay-Z to allegedly have the spotlight so that she could announce a new album, streaming platform, or product.\"It's what I think. Let's pay attention. I think within the next month or so, Nicki is gonna announce an album, maybe she's gonna start a streaming platform. I think Nicki's causing this roar to introduce something else she's about to do. I could be wrong, but if we look up, Nicki's now streaming, doing some Kai Cenat type s**t, or she releases an album, or a product, I think this is what that's about,\" he said.Elsewhere in the episode, Wack100 claimed that Minaj was seemingly aware that her rival, Cardi B, was releasing an album later this year, and was therefore using this as an opportunity to have the \"light on her\" so she could \"present something else to the masses.\"\"I believe she's doing this because she's about to announce something. I could be wrong. I believe we gonna see her announce, 'I'm on a new streaming platform or I got a product coming out,' or she releases a song. She knows Cardi's coming, Cardi's due, what September...I think she's doing this to put the light on her and the chat on her so she can then present something else to the masses,\" Wack 100 said.Notably, Nicki Minaj reached out to Adin Ross and Kai Cenat last week for livestreaming advice. According to Rap-Up, she reportedly asked the popular streamers to highlight the pros and cons between Twitch and Kick.Nicki Minaj claimed she was owed $100 - 200 million following the Tidal dealIn a recent X post, Nicki Minaj claimed she was owed over $100 - 200 million from Tidal. For the unversed, Minaj, one of the 15 artists gifted a 3% equity stake in Tidal, had previously claimed she was offered only $1 million after Jay-Z reportedly sold his ownership share to Jack Dorsey’s company for $302 million in 2021.In an X post in September 2024, she claimed she was \"scammed\" during the sale and was allegedly offered the $1 million to be \"silenced.\" However, she claimed she refused the deal, writing that she didn't need their \"hush money.\"Nicki Minaj reiterated these claims on social media last week. In an X post on July 8, 2025, she further alleged that she was owed $100 - 200 million, writing:\"We’ve calculated about 100-200MM so far. #JayZ call me to settle this karmic debt. It’s only collecting more interest. You still in my TOP 5 tho. Let’s get it n***a. And anyone still calling him Hov will answer to God for the blasphemy.\"In a follow-up post, she added that she planned to use the money to pay off her fans' student loans via her charity.Nicki Minaj @NICKIMINAJLINKI’m going to use some of the money #JayZ owes me to send some of my Barbz to college, pay their school fees & student loans via my #StudentOfTheGame charity.Exploring Nicki Minaj's other posts about Jay-ZIn another post, July 8, 2025, she accused Jay-Z of \"staying silent,\" and allowing Desiree Perez to allegedly do \"a lot of evil to black ppl.\" According to Rolling Stone, she also brought up Perez's pardon from President Donald Trump for her old narcotics and parole charges, implying that this prevented Jay-Z and Roc Nation from vocally supporting Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.That same day, Nicki Minaj also shared a screenshot of an article about Rymir Satterthwaite (who claims to be Jay-Z's alleged son) and his ongoing paternity lawsuit against the rapper, writing:“Oh is this why he was trending the other day? Idk. I hope all is well. To God be the glory.”In September 2024, Nicki Minaj criticized the Super Bowl for allegedly overlooking Lil Wayne and picking Kendrick Lamar to headline its 2025 halftime show. While she didn't mention Jay-Z by name, many perceived her post to be a dig at the rapper and his company. For context, Roc Nation works with the NFL to help produce the halftime show.“Denying a young Black man what he rightfully put into this game for no other reason but your ego. Your hatred for BIRDMAN, Drake & Nicki got you punishing Lil Wayne?!?!!! LIL WAYNE!!!!!!!!!! THE GOAT?!!!!!!!!!!! Nola what’s good?!!!!!! Eminem stood firm on having 50Cent come out. A white man,” Minaj wrote at the time.Jay-Z has not publicly responded to Nicki Minaj's posts at the time of writing this article.","summary":"No Jumper hosts Adam22 and Wack 100 recently discussed the ongoing conflict between Nicki Minaj and Jay-Z during an episode of The Adam & Wack Show, posted to YouTube on July 13, 2025.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/music/news-wack-100-thinks-nicki-minaj-picking-fight-jay-z-roc-nation-plans-drop-album-next-months","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/07/4ffd1-17524786352125-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 11:01:45","author":"Juhi Marzia","authors":["Juhi Marzia"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.111},{"id":341380364,"title":"Ellen DeGeneres supports Rosie O’Donnell as Donald Trump threatens to strip her US citizenship","text":"Ellen DeGeneres has thrown her support behind Rosie O’Donnell after President Trump threatened to strip the comedian of her US citizenship.\n\nThe former talk show host, 67, took to Instagram over the weekend to give props to the “A League of Their Own” star, 63, after she branded the commander in chief a “dangerous old soulless man.”\n\n“Good for you,” DeGeneres — who moved to England with her wife earlier this year — wrote alongside a screenshot of Trump’s Truth Social post, as well as a screenshot of O’Donnell’s response to the president.\n\nOn Saturday, the POTUS raged that he’s giving “serious consideration” to taking away the comedian’s US citizenship — prompting her to fire back with a flurry of posts ripping him and picturing him with Jeffrey Epstein. \n\nThe digital spat kickstarted after Trump branded O’Donnell a “threat to humanity” in a fiery post on his social media platform.\n\n“Because of the fact that Rosie O’Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship,” Trump wrote.\n\n“She is a Threat to Humanity, and should remain in the wonderful Country of Ireland, if they want her.

Others, though, seemed grimly unsurprised that a national tide of scorched-earth politics and extremism had crashed into Minnesota.\n\n“We live in a society that demonizes [public officials],” says Kristofer Scheide, a university employee waiting in line outside the rotunda. His mother was a state lawmaker, he says, and he has seen the toll on those in public life.\n\nAcross the country, a rise in political violence is upending norms of democracy and heightening the risks of public service for officials from presidential candidates to Supreme Court justices, state lawmakers to local politicians. In the weeks just since the June 14 shootings in Minnesota, in which another state lawmaker and his wife were also critically wounded, a Memphis man was charged with attempted kidnapping after police said Memphis he scaled a wall to reach the home of Mayor Paul Young, while Ohio Rep. Max Miller said a man ran him off the road and said he wanted to kill him. Earlier this year, a Pennsylvania man was charged with arson and attempted homicide after a nighttime attack on Gov. Josh Shapiro’s house that forced him and his family to flee.\n\nMany compare the current period to the late 1960s and early 1970s, another tumultuous time that saw numerous bombings and several high-profile assassinations. Last summer, President Donald Trump survived two alleged assassination attempts, including one in which a bullet nicked his ear and a rallygoer was shot and killed.\n\nBut experts say the current wave of political violence is distinct in several ways. While the violence in the 1960s and ’70s was perpetrated mostly by those with left-wing views, today’s attacks are more often committed by right-wing extremists or people with incoherent ideological beliefs. And it isn’t just national figures, but relatively unknown state and local officials being attacked – often in their homes.\n\n“We seem to be witnessing a growing phenomenon in which politicians are actually being targeted not at work and not in public places, but in their homes, and I think that’s a very concerning development,” says Jacob Ware, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who studies terrorism and extremism.\n\nThe public response is also different. While previous periods of political violence sparked widespread shock and outrage that often led to reforms, the reaction today seems more muted.\n\nSome Americans even appear to condone political violence. In a 2024 poll by PRRI, 29% of Republicans agreed that “true American patriots” may need to use violence to save the country “because things have gotten so far off track.” Since the 2024 election, similar beliefs have surged on the left. A survey in May by the Chicago Project on Security and Threats found that 40% of Democrats would support the use of force to remove Mr. Trump from office, according to Robert Pape, the project’s director.\n\nSuch attitudes reflect a general erosion of norms, says Mr. Ware. He and others point to a general coarsening of political rhetoric, and a tendency to frame policy disputes in existential terms. And as violent events increase, each one seems less shocking. Just as school shootings have become numbingly routine, incidents like the shootings of lawmakers in Minnesota move out of the news cycle in a matter of days.\n\n“It feels like the culture has shifted, and we’ve entered an era of normalized violence,” Mr. Ware says.\n\n“Targeted political assassinations”\n\nOn the same day that the Hortmans lay in state at the Capitol, a man wearing a padded green smock, held together by Velcro, and rubber-soled orange slip-ons was led inside a federal courtroom a mile away. It was the second courtroom appearance for Vance Boelter, a Minnesota father of five charged in connection with the shootings.\n\nProsecutors say Mr. Boelter posed as a police officer, driving a black Ford SUV with fake plates and flashing lights in the early hours of June 14 to the suburban homes of multiple state lawmakers, and wearing body armor and a face mask. Before murdering the Hortmans, they allege, he also shot and critically wounded state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, who had opened the door to him. He was arrested after a massive manhunt and faces multiple counts of murder, stalking, and firearm offenses.\n\nJoe Thompson, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Minnesota, said Mr. Boelter committed “targeted political assassinations.”\n\nPolice recovered guns and ammunition from Mr. Boelter’s SUV, along with notebooks containing the names and home addresses of dozens of elected officials. All were Democrats, according to media reports; they included Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Sen. Tina Smith, and state Attorney General Keith Ellison, as well as the names of abortion providers and abortion-rights activists.\n\nProsecutors haven’t spoken publicly about Mr. Boelter’s motivations. He held conservative views on abortion and was active in evangelical Christian churches, including in Africa. Friends have told reporters that he was volatile and had struggled to find stable work. Before being captured by authorities, Mr. Boelter texted his family, “Dad went to war last night,” according to an FBI affidavit.\n\nFar-right extremists have accounted for the majority of attacks and plots in the United States in recent years, outpacing attacks by far-left and Islamic extremists. But while Mr. Boelter’s targets and reported beliefs suggest right-wing extremism, analysts caution that it’s often hard to draw a straight line from political beliefs to a violent act, and that law enforcement is finding more cases in which violence seems motivated more by nihilism.\n\nThe alleged Minnesota shooter “might be somebody who just does not have a coherent ideology,” says Mr. Ware.\n\nA point of contention in Mr. Boelter’s June 27 hearing was his padded green smock, a type of anti-suicide dress worn without undergarments. His lawyer asked that her client be permitted to wear regular prison clothing, which the judge agreed to. Asked for his response, Mr. Boelter told the court, “I’ve never been suicidal, and I’m not suicidal now.”\n\nSome perpetrators of political violence do take their own lives, or seek to die at the hands of law enforcement, say terrorism analysts. Others prefer to be captured and stand trial in order to gain a platform to justify their acts.\n\nIn a subsequent July 3 court appearance, Mr. Boelter waived his right to detention and probable cause hearings, indicating he wanted the case to proceed to trial. “I’m looking forward to the truth and facts about [June] 14th to come to the public and before you and especially what happened before the 14th,” Mr. Boelter told the judge.\n\nToxic partisanship, harsh rhetoric\n\nExperts on political violence say public officials can help deescalate tensions by condemning violence and supporting peaceful democratic expression. To be more effective, politicians should issue joint statements and make appearances with their political opponents, they say.\n\nFollowing the June 14 attacks, Minnesota’s congressional delegation, made up of six Democrats and four Republicans, issued a joint statement. And the U.S. House passed a bipartisan resolution condemning the violence and honoring the state lawmakers.\n\nPresident Trump criticized the violence as well, but didn’t reach out to Mr. Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 2024. Asked later why he hadn’t called the Minnesota governor, Mr. Trump told reporters, “The guy doesn’t have a clue. He’s a mess. So, you know, I could be nice and call him, but why waste time?”\n\nSome experts point to the increasing use of political language that dehumanizes opponents and depicts them as un-American as contributing to a tinderbox environment. When George Wallace, a segregationist Southerner, ran for president in 1968, his blood-and-soil rhetoric was condemned by other candidates as a form of extremism, says Kevin Boyle, a historian at Northwestern University and author of “The Shattering: America in the 1960s.” By contrast, Mr. Trump’s blunt denigration of his opponents has become the everyday language of his administration, and is being imitated by other politicians, including opponents.\n\nThat impacts the public, too – raising the bar for what people consider shocking or unacceptable.\n\n“The level of shock and opposition to political violence in the ’60s was very, very high. This was not the way that people imagined that they or other people should settle their political differences,” Professor Boyle says.\n\nAt the Minnesota Capitol, some expressed at least tentative hope that the Hortmans’ killings could spur some kind of national reckoning.\n\nThe line of visitors waiting to pay their respects stretched around the block. At noon, Colin Hortman, the son of the victims, came outside to greet those in line. “I’m literally here hugging every person,” he told a gray-bearded man in a veterans’ cap as they embraced.\n\nInside, St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter voiced his grief at losing his close friends and, in Ms. Hortman, a political ally who worked tirelessly for her community. He shook his head. “It feels like a terrible marker of where we are as a country,” he says.\n\nLater that afternoon, former President Joe Biden made an unannounced visit to the Capitol, where he kneeled beside the coffins. He and former Vice President Kamala Harris were among more than 1,000 attendees of the couple’s funeral held at a Catholic church in Minneapolis. Mr. Walz eulogized Ms. Hortman’s service in the legislature, calling her “the most consequential speaker in Minnesota history” as well as a friend and mentor.\n\nThe pastor who led the service, the Rev. Daniel Griffith, lamented that the state had become “ground zero” for political violence. He drew a comparison with the 2020 killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis – an event that sparked a national conversation about racial injustice and a broader movement to push for change. In the wake of this latest tragedy, he said, he hopes Minnesota could be “a ground zero place for restoration and justice and healing.”","summary":"Experts warn of an era of “normalized violence,” impacting state and local officials along with national politicians – who are increasingly being attacked at home.","url":"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2025/0714/minnesota-shootings-rising-political-violence?icid=rss","image":"https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2025/07/0701%20NMINN%20LEDE.jpg?alias=standard_1200x800","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 09:00:09","author":"Simon Montlake","authors":["Simon Montlake"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":341543638,"title":"Pastors should be more involved in politics, not less","text":"Before 1954, pastors, priests and rabbis could openly endorse political parties or candidates.\n\nThen came the Johnson Amendment, named for Lyndon Baines Johnson, then a senator from Texas who tweaked the IRS code. Suddenly, tax-exempt nonprofits were barred from “participating or intervening in any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.” The “opposition to” phrase was added in 1986.\n\nA ruthless political strategist before and during his presidency, Johnson engineered this coup after two Texas nonprofit groups had supported his Senate primary opponent.\n\nThis effectively silenced clergy who feared losing their tax-exempt status. Over the next 70 years, conservative pastors self-censored while liberal pastors ignored the rule, knowing the IRS would never enforce the law on them. This greatly benefited Democrats.\n\nDespite the code’s blatant unconstitutionality, it stood until last week, when the IRS announced it would no longer enforce it. Congress needs to follow this up with full repeal.\n\nAnyway, a conservative columnist whom I regard highly and won’t name is lamenting this long-overdue reprieve. He wrote that pastors who practice “partisan politics” would “dilute their primary mission” and said he would leave any such church. “Politicians and preachers should mostly stay in their own lanes,” he wrote.\n\nThis might explain why a survey in the fall indicated that millions of self-identified Christians don’t bother with elections.\n\n“The 32 million Christians sitting in the pews each week who refuse to vote are a gamechanger,” concluded pollster George Barna. “It’s low hanging fruit for pastors as they try to motivate those congregants to carry out their civic duty and honor God through their influence for things that matter in our culture.”\n\nOver the years, Christian leaders such as Focus on the Family founder James Dobson, the Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Rev. Franklin Graham have been excoriated for encouraging more Christian activism, especially on social issues such as marriage and abortion.\n\nWithout Mr. Falwell’s Moral Majority, Ronald Reagan may not have won his presidential races in the 1980s.\n\nChristian activism from the pulpit helped Virginia Republicans elect conservative statewide officials in 2021. It was a key element of President Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris and the Republican capture of both houses of Congress in 2024.\n\nAt the end of the aforementioned column, my colleague quotes Jesus telling Pontius Pilate, “‘My kingdom is not of this world’ (John 18:36). That ought to be good enough for everyone to put their priorities in the right order.”\n\nYou can just hear the American Civil Liberties Union and other Democrats cheering, “Yeah, what he says: Stay out of these fights!” In practice, that means Christian pastors taking the easy way out and ignoring pressing realities instead of being “salt and light.”\n\nMeanwhile, functional atheists enact immoral policies.\n\nIf you want to see what that looks like, check out any Planned Parenthood abortion mill or a public library’s drag queen story hour.\n\nI have several questions: Where in the Bible is there any limit on Jesus’ influence in this world? Where does it say that Christian pastors can address any and all sectors of life except public policy?\n\nJesus said to render unto Caesar what is Caesar’s, but that doesn’t give Caesar a license to commit evil without opposition.\n\nShould William Wilberforce, the outspoken Christian in Great Britain’s Parliament, have stayed silent instead of working from 1790 to 1807 to end the trans-Atlantic slave trade? After all, it was a political matter.\n\nShould pastors have been barred from supporting abolitionists in the United States before the Civil War ended slavery? Perhaps they should have “stayed in their own lane.”\n\nThe same goes for pastors who spurred enactment of the civil rights laws in the mid-1960s, with a greater percentage of Republican support than Democratic.\n\nLikewise, opposing abortion in the pulpit while declining to expose the politicians who facilitate it (the entire Democratic Party and some Republicans) is ineffectual at best.\n\nCongregations look to their clergy for guidance. If the pastors don’t bother to mention politics or elections, these must not be important.\n\nYet, as we see every day, elections have profound consequences.\n\nAll laws have a moral dimension. Compliance, as with taxes, is not voluntary. Laws are enforced by potential violence from the state, even for traffic violations. If you don’t pay your fine, you can be jailed.\n\nIn 1819, the U.S. Supreme Court said in McCulloch v. Maryland that “the power to tax involves the power to destroy.”\n\nI don’t want pastors to “stay in their own lane.” They should speak out more forcefully against politicians who enact evil policies in the name of euphemisms such as “reproductive freedom,” “gender-affirming care” or “social justice.”\n\nAt the same time, with the fig leaf of IRS fears gone, they can and should openly endorse upstanding candidates. This could change the world for the better.\n\n• Robert Knight is a columnist for The Washington Times.

Their bitter back-and-forth predates Trump’s involvement in politics. In 2006, O’Donnell criticized Trump for remarks he made about a winner of his Miss USA beauty pageant, saying he had no right to be a “moral compass” for the beauty queen. That unleashed a series of barbs from Trump, who called O’Donnell a “loser” and “slob,” among other insults. In turn, O’Donnell questioned his business skills and compared him to a “snake oil salesman.” In 2015, during Trump’s first presidential campaign, O’Donnell said: “It’s a nightmare”, and further took him to task over his crude remarks about women. In recent days, O’Donnell on social media denounced Trump and recent moves by his administration, including the signing of a massive GOP-backed tax breaks and spending cuts plan.This is just the latest threat by Trump to revoke the citizenship of people with whom he has publicly disagreed, most recently his former adviser and one-time ally, Elon Musk.However, O'Donnell's situation is different from Musk, who was born in South Africa. O'Donnell was born in the United States and has a constitutional right to US citizenship.The US State Department notes on its website that US citizens by birth or naturalization may relinquish US nationality by taking certain steps – but only if the act is performed voluntary and with the intention of relinquishing US citizenship.Amanda Frost, a law professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, noted the Supreme Court ruled in a 1967 case that the Fourteen Amendment of the Constitution prevents the government from taking away citizenship.“The president has no authority to take away the citizenship of a native-born US citizen,\" Frost said. “In short, we are nation founded on the principle that the people choose the government; the government cannot choose the people.”O'Donnell moved to Ireland after Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris to win his second term. She has said she's in the process of obtaining Irish citizenship based on family lineage, and that she would only return to the US \"when it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America\".Responding to Trump’s most recent threat, O’Donnell wrote on social media that Trump “has always hated the fact that I see him for who he is - a criminal con man sexual abusing liar out to harm our nation to serve himself - this is whyI moved to Ireland - he is a dangerous old soulless man with dementia who lacks empathy compassion and basic humanity.”She also posted a photograph of Trump with Jeffrey Epstein on Instagram, adding: \"You are everything that is wrong with America and I'm everything you hate about what's still right with it.”\"I'm not yours to silence. I never was.\"","summary":"Donald Trump has said he is considering \"taking away\" the US citizenship of actress and comedian Rosie O'Donnell - despite a Supreme Court ruling that expressly prohibits him or the government from doing so.","url":"https://www.euronews.com/culture/2025/07/14/donald-trump-threatens-to-revoke-comedian-rosie-odonnells-us-citizenship","image":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/37/01/60/1440x810_cmsv2_8cd64773-a8b5-5d48-a971-1828106ce681-9370160.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 06:07:35","author":"David Mouriquand","authors":["David Mouriquand"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":0.112},{"id":341306826,"title":"Why has Trump threatened to revoke US-born Rosie O'Donnell's citizenship?","text":"US President Donald Trump says he's considering \"taking away\" the citizenship of Rosie O'Donnell, who was born in the United States.\n\nO'Donnell publicly criticised Mr Trump on social media in the past week, but it's not the first time she's been vocal against him.\n\nLet's look back at the history of their feud and how it escalated over the weekend.\n\nWhat did Trump say about O'Donnell?\n\nMr Trump posted on his own social media platform, Truth Social, that he was \"giving serious consideration to taking away her citizenship\".\n\nHe said this because she was \"not in the best interests of our great country\" and called her a \"threat to humanity\".\n\nAt the moment, it appears that people cannot see the US president's profile on the platform unless they sign up to have an account, so here's a screenshot of that post:\n\nCan Trump 'take away' O'Donnell's US citizenship?\n\nO'Donnell was born in the US, giving her the right to citizenship under the US Constitution.\n\nAnd this has been backed up by a US Supreme Court ruling way back in 1967, University of Virginia law professor Amanda Frost said.\n\n\"The president has no authority to take away the citizenship of a native-born US citizen,\" she said.\n\n\"In short, we are a nation founded on the principle that the people choose the government; the government cannot choose the people.\"\n\nUS citizens can choose to renounce their citizenship, but that's something they can only do voluntarily.\n\nThat process requires two separate interviews and making what's called an \"oath of renunciation of US nationality\", according to the US Department of State's website.\n\nWhen he was re-elected, Mr Trump signed an executive order that would have ended the ability for the children of illegal migrants to claim birthright citizenship in the US.\n\nHowever, that order has been blocked by a federal judge and is expected to be tested by the US Supreme Court.\n\nEither way, there has been no suggestion O'Donnell's family circumstances would apply in those circumstances.\n\nWho is O'Donnell?\n\nShe's an actor, talk show host and comedian.\n\nO'Donnell starred in movies including A League of Their Own, Now and Then, Sleepless in Seattle and Harriet the Spy.\n\nShe was a regular on daytime television, hosting a talk show called The Rosie Show from 1996 to 2002.\n\nO'Donnell was also a member of the US TV talk show The View, with IMDB listing 121 appearances to her name between 2005 and 2016.\n\nDespite being born in the US, O'Donnell now lives in Ireland, having moved there after Mr Trump defeated then-vice-president Kamala Harris in last year's election.\n\nShe has said she is trying to secure Irish citizenship based on her family lineage.\n\nWhere did the Trump and O'Donnell feud start?\n\nMost US media outlets trace it back to 2006, when O'Donnell was on The View.\n\nMr Trump came up as a topic on the show after he held a press conference in his capacity as the then-owner of the Miss Universe Organization.\n\nHe said he would give Tara Conner \"a second chance\" after threatening to strip her of her Miss USA crown amid rumours she had been frequenting bars while underage.\n\nIn a clip of the show reposted to YouTube, O'Donnell impersonates Mr Trump by sweeping her hair into a comb-over and mocking his voice, then questions his right to judge Conner.\n\n\"He's the moral authority,\" she said sarcastically.\n\n\"[He] left the first wife, had an affair, left the second wife, had an affair, had kids both times, but he's the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America.\"\n\nShe also compared him to a con artist, criticised him for inheriting money and going bankrupt, and accused him of leaving his creditors in the lurch.\n\nMr Trump responded by giving a statement to entertainment website People, calling O'Donnell \"a real loser\".\n\n\"Rosie will rue the words she said,\" he told People.\n\n\"I'll most likely sue her for making those false statements — and it'll be fun.\"\n\nMutual dislike heightens during presidential campaign\n\nThe pair's feud continued throughout the years, but ramped up as Mr Trump went into politics.\n\nDuring Mr Trump's first presidential campaign in 2015, he brought up O'Donnell when asked about his use of language to describe women by debate moderator Megyn Kelly:\n\nKelly: You've called women you don't like 'fat pigs', 'dogs', 'slobs' and disgusting animals.

(AP) — The first presidential primary votes won’t be cast for another two and a half years. And yet, over the span of 10 days in July, three Democratic presidential prospects are scheduled to campaign in South Carolina.\n\nNearly a half dozen others have made recent pilgrimages to South Carolina, New Hampshire and Iowa — states that traditionally host the nation’s opening presidential nomination contests. Still other ambitious Democrats are having private conversations with officials on the ground there. \n\nThe voters in these states are used to seeing presidential contenders months or even years before most of the country, but the political jockeying in 2025 for the 2028 presidential contest appears to be playing out earlier, with more frequency and with less pretense than ever before.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom was referred to as a presidential candidate at one stop in his two-day South Carolina tour last week. Voters shouted “2028!” after he insisted he was there simply to strengthen the party ahead of the 2026 midterms. South Carolina has virtually no competitive midterm contests.\n\nTerm-limited Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who acknowledges he’s considering a 2028 bid, will spend two days touring South Carolina this week. He will focus on the state’s Black community while drawing an implicit contrast with Newsom on cultural issues, according to excerpts of his planned remarks obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nCalifornia Congressman Ro Khanna, a progressive aligned with the Bernie Sanders ’ wing of the Democratic Party, will target union members and Black voters when he’s in the state a few days later with the son of a civil rights leader.\n\nAnd former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is having private conversations with key South Carolina Democrats, including presidential primary kingmaker Rep. Jim Clyburn, in which Emanuel indicated strong interest in a presidential run. That’s according to Clyburn himself, who said he’s also had direct contact with Beshear and Khanna after appearing alongside Newsom last week and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore in May. \n\n“That’s what candidates have to do: position themselves and be ready when lightning strikes,” Clyburn said. \n\nDemocrats look to turn the page from 2024\n\nThe unusually early jockeying is playing out as the Democratic Party struggles to repair its brand, rebuild its message and fill a leadership vacuum after losing the White House and both chambers of Congress in 2024. \n\nDemocrats are decidedly more optimistic about 2028. \n\nRepublicans will not have the advantage of incumbency in the next presidential contest; the Constitution bars President Donald Trump from seeking a third term. And the race for the Democratic nomination appears to be wide open, even as 2024 nominee Kamala Harris and running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have left open the possibility of running again.\n\nWith no clear front-runner, some Democratic operatives believe upwards of 30 high-profile Democrats could ultimately enter the 2028 primary — more than the party’s overpacked 2020 field.\n\nAnd as Democrats struggle to stop Trump’s power grabs in Washington, some report a real sense of urgency to get the 2028 process started.\n\nTexas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a rising Democratic star, told the AP earlier this year that presidential prospects “need to be more visible earlier” as party officials look to take cues from a new generation of leaders. \n\n“What freaks most Democrats out is not really understanding who’s up next. Like, who’s got next?” she said. “And I think that that is really what people want most; they want their presidential nominee now.” \n\nA Kentucky Democrat steps into the conversation\n\nBeshear, Kentucky’s 47-year-old two-term governor, is scheduled to make his first visit to South Carolina on political grounds on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nHe will promote his appeal among red-state moderates and Black voters in a Thursday speech hosted by the Georgetown County Democrats in a region that voted three times for Trump and has a large Black population.\n\n“Democrats have a huge opportunity to seize the middle and win back the voters who have been increasingly skeptical of the Democratic brand. But it’s going to take focus and discipline,” Beshear is expected to say, according to speech excerpts obtained by the AP.\n\nThere are no direct jabs at Newsom in the excerpts, but Beshear is expected to continue drawing contrasts with the California governor, who earlier this year suggested his party went too far in embracing “woke” priorities. In his prepared remarks, Beshear doesn’t shy away from such progressive cultural issues. \n\nHe will note he made Juneteenth an executive branch holiday for the first time in Kentucky, signed an executive order that prohibits discrimination against state workers for how they wear their hair and ordered the removal of a statue of Jefferson Davis, who served as the president of the Confederacy during the Civil War.\n\n“The current federal administration wants to make diversity a dirty word,” Beshear plans to say. “They want people to believe that equity means everyone isn’t worthy of opportunities.”\n\nWho else is stepping up?\n\nAlready this year, Walz of Minnesota and Moore of Maryland have addressed South Carolina Democrats. \n\nBiden Cabinet member Pete Buttigieg, a 2020 presidential candidate, hosted a town hall in Iowa in May. The month before, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker headlined a Democratic fundraiser in New Hampshire.\n\nOthers are moving more cautiously. \n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro has avoided any early state travel this year, focusing instead on his 2026 reelection. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has also focused largely on her day job. Both would be top-tier presidential candidates should they decide to run. \n\nKhanna has been working to build his national profile since before the last election with frequent trips to New Hampshire, among other early voting states. \n\nThe California congressman is scheduled to host two town-hall style meetings in South Carolina this weekend with Illinois Rep. Jonathan Jackson, the son of civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson. \n\nKhanna casts his lower profile — at least compared to potential competitors like Newsom and Shapiro — as an asset when asked about his party’s early 2028 field.\n\n“I think it’s very different than in the past when you’ve had clear defined leaders of the party. I think that’s healthy. There is no status quo person,” Khanna said. ”My guess is the last thing the party is going to want is more of the same.”\n\nNewsom’s South Carolina dance\n\nNewsom spent much of last year denying interest in a presidential run. But with his final term as governor set to expire at the end of next year, his 2028 ambitions are starting to emerge more publicly.\n\nDuring his recent South Carolina tour, Newsom only smiled when voters shouted “2028!” after he referenced his focus on the 2026 midterms.\n\nClyburn said openly what the California governor would not. Appearing with Newsom, Clyburn encouraged local Democrats to be energized by the visits of “presidential candidates” coming early and often to their state. \n\nNewsom looked around, seemingly seeking the object of Clyburn’s remark, as the crowd laughed. \n\nIn an interview afterward, Clyburn said he doesn’t have an early favorite in the 2028 Democratic nomination contest. \n\nNew Hampshire remains a player\n\nPritzker headlined a key state fundraiser in New Hampshire in May. And state Democratic leaders are privately encouraging other 2028 prospects to visit the state. \n\nUnlike South Carolina, New Hampshire features two competitive House races and a top-tier Senate election next year. \n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, campaigned Friday in the state with Rep. Chris Pappas, who is expected to represent Democrats on the Senate ballot next fall. \n\nIn a brief interview, she insisted her only purpose was backing Pappas’ campaign.\n\n“I am here to help my friend,” she said. “I know a lot of people here and I want to put it to use in a good way.”\n\nWhat do the voters say?\n\nIt may be early, but some Democratic voters and local officials say they’re ready to get the cycle started. \n\nJody Gaulin, the Democratic chair of a deep-red South Carolina county, is hoping the energy that comes along with potential candidates could boost her party’s ranks.\n\n“This is exactly what we’ve been waiting for,” Gaulin said. \n\nIt’s much the same in New Hampshire. \n\nDemocrat Jane Lescynski, who works at the manufacturing facility Klobuchar toured Friday, had a quick answer when asked her thoughts about the 2028 presidential election. \n\n“I can’t wait,” she said. \n\nPeoples reported from New York.

Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) announced he wouldn’t seek reelection.\n\nThe daughter-in-law of President Trump and a former Republican National Committee (RNC) co-chair, Lara Trump has quickly become an early favorite for the GOP nomination if she chooses to run. A source close to the president said she’s considering a bid; it would clear the Republican field if she chooses to go forward.\n\nWhile she’s turned down possible Senate bids in the past, she would bring significant name recognition and instant backing from the top levels of the GOP.\n\n“She has, in my opinion, earned the right of first refusal if she wants to do it,” said North Carolina Republican strategist Jonathan Felts. “And more importantly, regardless of what I think about it, the most powerful and the most popular Republican on the planet, he thinks so, too.” \n\nA potential Senate run for Lara Trump, who is married to the president’s son Eric, has been teased for years.\n\nShe was rumored as a possible candidate to succeed former Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) in the state’s 2022 Senate race, but she decided against it, citing the difficulty of running with young children. She endorsed then-Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) in the race; he went on to win. \n\n“I am saying no for now, not no forever,” she said at the time about her own possible candidacy. \n\nShe was also rumored last year to be an option for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) to fill the Senate seat vacated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. She removed her name from consideration despite “encouragement from so many.” \n\nBut speculation has been building for months that Trump would finally take the plunge for Tillis’s seat in 2026, even before Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek another term. A November survey from a Republican pollster found her leading Tillis in a hypothetical primary match-up by an overwhelming margin. \n\nWith Tillis out, Trump has commanded the attention in the race for the past few weeks. \n\nThe president mentioned Lara Trump when asked by reporters about who could replace Tillis, saying she’s “somebody that would really be great.” He acknowledged that she and Eric live in Florida, but he emphasized her ties to the Tar Heel State. \n\n“She’s a great person, Lara Trump. I mean, that would always be my first choice, but she doesn’t live there now,” President Trump said. “But she’s there all the time, her parents are there. You know, she really knows North Carolina well.” \n\nAnd one of the other top names being floated, RNC Chair Michael Whatley, signaled he would defer to her if she wants to run and would expect the party to do so as well. \n\n“What I will say is this: If Lara Trump is going to be interested, then she is certainly going to have the entire Republican universe myself included that are going to coalesce behind her,” he told the Washington Examiner in an interview. \n\nFirst-term Rep. Pat Harrigan (R-N.C.), another possible candidate, also said he wouldn’t run if Trump does. \n\nA GOP operative who’s worked on North Carolina Senate races described Trump’s choice as “personal” and a “family decision.” \n\nBut Republicans said a Trump candidacy would likely be their best-case scenario, particularly as former Gov. Roy Cooper mulls a bid for the seat on the Democratic side. \n\nFelts said having Trump on the ballot could help increase turnout for Republicans, noting her father-in-law’s demonstrated prowess at encouraging voters who often don’t participate to come to the polls. \n\nHe said Republicans will have to maximize turnout in small rural areas to overcome Democratic strengths in other parts of the state. \n\nFelts said no candidate could reach the level of support the president would have, but he would give a boost. \n\n“He’s just a uniquely popular figure, but having a Trump on the ballot would be helpful,” he said. \n\nStill, Lara Trump could have some potential vulnerabilities if she runs. Despite playing an active role in campaigning for her father-in-law and other candidates previously, she has never run for office herself. \n\nNorth Carolina Democratic strategist Morgan Jackson said her candidacy would solve a problem Republicans had with Tillis, who was increasingly unpopular with the Republican base. But she could turn off the critical 1 percent to 3 percent of voters who swing in the middle. \n\n“I think Thom Tillis had a better shot at those voters than Lara Trump does because he did not come across to those voters as a partisan warrior,” Jackson said. “And frankly, I think the last thing voters are looking for is a partisan warrior right now, and I say that as either a Democrat or Republican nominee.” \n\n“What is clear is with Thom Tillis being run out of the race by [President] Trump is that they’re going to get a partisan warrior,” he added. \n\nFelts said he’s not concerned about Lara Trump being untested as a candidate because she showed her strength while campaigning for others. He said she “had audiences eating out of her hand” speaking at the state GOP convention in 2021, demonstrating her grassroots appeal. \n\n“I know she’s told Ted, she’s all in for Ted,” Felts recalled thinking at the time. “If she were to announce right now [she’s running], I mean, the place would just go insane.” \n\nOne other attack she could face is a perceived lack of loyalty to North Carolina. Despite being born and raised there, she and her family live in Florida. Accusations of carpetbagging have been a common attack in key Senate races in recent years. \n\nBut Republicans emphasized that she still has deep ties to the state and knows it well. \n\nOne North Carolina Republican insider pointed to former Sen. Elizabeth Dole (R), who was originally from the state but hadn’t lived there for years before her comfortable electoral victory to the Senate in 2002. \n\n“She’s very well known,” he said. “She has taken time with the grassroots, speaking [at] a bunch of Lincoln-Reagan dinners across the state over the years, and so she’s definitely a known commodity and considered North Carolinian by the key folks in this state.” \n\nThe insider said she would start out with an advantage in name identification that the other possible GOP candidates couldn’t match and get the voters who only vote every four years. \n\n“It’s just a question of, are there voters in the middle, unaffiliated voters” who preferred President Trump to former Vice President Kamala Harris but aren’t fully invested in Trump himself, he added. \n\n“I don’t know. That would be tested for sure,” he said. “I do think that that’s offset by all of the enthusiastic Trump voters that would turn out in a midterm that might not otherwise.” \n\nJackson stressed that the result in the battleground state will likely be close regardless of the candidates, though analysts agree candidate quality will matter considerably. \n\n“North Carolina is a very big state. It’s big. It’s hard to win. I don’t care which side of the aisle you’re on,” he said. “You’re going to have a close race, and it’s going to be a tough race.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRepublicans are eager to see Lara Trump enter the North Carolina Senate&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Republicans Anticipate Lara Trump&#8217;s Decision on North Carolina Senate Bid first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/republicans-anticipate-lara-trumps-decision-on-north-carolina-senate-bid/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/rewrite-this-title-Republicans-eagerly-await-Lara-Trump039s-decision-on.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-14 03:35:59","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.326},{"id":341268456,"title":"Douglas Schoen: New York City moves left, California moves right","text":"Zohran Mamdani’s surprise victory in last month’s New York City Democratic Mayoral primary has raised two important questions that may impact the direction of the Democratic Party, and thus American politics. \n\nFirst, does Mamdani’s win offer definitive proof of the power of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, or was it a relative fluke due to circumstances too unique to be replicated in other cities, states, or on the national level?\n\nSecond, as it relates to California specifically, will Mamdani’s victory boost a progressive movement that has seen voters increasingly reject it in recent years?\n\nTo be sure, there are legitimate arguments for both sides of these questions.\n\nIndeed, Mamdani not only won, but, in receiving 56% of the final vote, soundly defeated the competition led by former Gov.

The Office of Personnel Management tracks when political appointees transition to career positions—a process often referred to as “burrowing in” to the bureaucracy—and Sarah Scheinman did so in 2022.\n\nEarlier this year, Scheinman posted a photo of herself with President Joe Biden.\n\n“So proud to have served in the Biden-Harris administration these past four years,” she wrote on LinkedIn. “I have worked with the most dedicated public servants in the White House, OMB, and the Department of Justice who every day seek to make things better for all of us.”\n\nAccording to OPM records, Scheinman transitioned from a political role to a career position on Oct. 31, 2022. She left her position as associate general counsel at the Office of Management and Budget to take an attorney-advisor position in the Justice Department’s antitrust division. In the transition, she went from an annual salary of $84,766 to $112,890. \n\nA Justice Department official confirmed to The Daily Signal Tuesday that Scheinman still works at the DOJ. An OMB official confirmed that she previously worked at OMB.\n\nAccording to her LinkedIn profile, Scheinman worked on the Biden campaign legal team from September to December 2020, before joining the White House Presidential Personnel Office in February 2021. She transitioned to OMB in September 2021.\n\nBefore joining the White House, she worked as an associate at Davis Polk & Wardwell. The law firm did not respond to The Daily Signal’s request for comment.\n\nDeep State Opposition\n\nA recent poll found that 75% of Washington, D.C.-based federal employees making $75,000 or more per year who voted for Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris in November said they would not follow a lawful Trump order if they considered it bad policy.\n\nWhile some political appointees who took “career” positions may faithfully work for the U.S. government under any president, this poll suggests that some staff inside the federal government may work against the goals of the current president, in this case Trump.\n\nFurthermore, a February Foundation for Government Accountability study found that Democrat employees outnumber Republican employees by a 2-to-1 margin across federal agencies. In the 2024 presidential election, 84% of the money that federal employees gave in political contributions went to Kamala Harris.\n\nFederal workers enjoy workplace protections that make them very difficult to fire. The new administration is seeking to reform these rules to enable the president to fulfill his duties as head of the executive branch without facing opposition from hostile bureaucrats.\n\nScheinman did not respond to The Daily Signal’s request for comment.\n\nThis is the latest in a series on bureaucrats burrowing in. Part one covers eight appointees. Part two focuses on a former Russiagate advisor who works at the Federal Aviation Administration. Part three reveals a former lawyer for then-Sen. Kamala Harris who now works at the Defense Department.","summary":"A lawyer who worked for Joe Biden&#8217;s 2020 presidential campaign and for two different offices in the Biden White House now works in President Donald...

She was at the height of her Modern Family fame, but instead of bubbly and bouncy, I found her to be annoying, arrogant and condescending.\n\nShe looked at me, a lowly journalist, like the veritable dirt on her Manolo.\n\nIt was a shame because I was such a fan of her Gloria character, but off camera – and despite her glorious curves — she has some sharp edges.\n\nThat night I also met the man who would become her second ex-husband, actor Joe Manganiello.\n\nHe was the utter opposite: gracious, affable and the kind of humble guy you want to root for. But he also got caught in her propeller.\n\nSoon after their 9-year union imploded last year, Sofia — worth a reported $180 million — gave an interview clearly designed to cut handsome Joe down to size.\n\n'I want somebody that has as much money as me or more, because if not, it's a nightmare. They end up resenting you,' she said.\n\nIf only that were the reason they end up resenting you, Sofia.\n\nThat naughty Tom Brady source told the Daily Mail last week that while the actress is certainly 'his type… he isn't going to start a relationship with her as she is older and stuck in her ways. He knows he could only take her in small doses.'\n\nTranslation: She's hot. But really, really annoying.\n\nShe's part of the Heidi Klum School of aging beauties who desperately advertise their bare assets on social media in a bid to squeeze every bit of daylight out of their hotness before the sun sets for good.\n\nIn fact, we only learned Sofia was on the Ritz Carlton yacht thanks to her constant stream of Insta snaps, showcasing her bodacious but aging backside.\n\nShe has a son who's 33. You wouldn't know it.\n\nAnd despite Brady's own predilection for nude sunbathing and over-plucking those brows, he's actually a pretty private guy.\n\nHis Gisele Bündchen divorce was wounding. And while she's moved swiftly on to play bedroom martial arts with her jiu-jitsu instructor, Tom's been left alone in retirement to worry about their three children.\n\nAfter appearing in a Netflix 'roast' last year — replete with light ribbing about his recent split — Tom admitted he thought of it as a parenting 'f*** up'.\n\n'It was tough on my kids for sure.'\n\nSo it is any wonder he now fears a hot-blooded blabbermouth who may use a union with him as leverage in the TikTok clout-chasing race?\n\nThis Herculean hottie may be a highly sought after, lubed up hunk of man meat, but he's still a real person with real feelings and is entitled to not date someone who'll treat him like a fleshy Vince Lombardi trophy.\n\nAnd spare me the talk of ageism and misogyny. I too am 52 and partnered up with a younger man. But I have enough self-respect to not post every detail of our lives — and my bare body! — and he very much enjoys when I tell him about things from the olden days like 'Diff'rent Strokes' and seeing 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' at the movies.\n\nTom's just being honest. Let him move on and not pester him to death over dodging this blatant bullet.\n\nFrench Epstein\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi is praying she never hears the name Jeffrey Epstein ever again. But I'm dumping fuel on the raging conspiracy fire.\n\nRemember Jean-Luc Brunel, the French 'modeling agent' who allegedly pimped out 12-year-old girls to Epstein and friends.\n\nBrunel curiously committed suicide in a Parisian jail, two years after Jeff allegedly off'ed himself.\n\nSorry, Pammy. I'm not helping, am I?\n\n Stupid spice\n\nJust how god awful are Krazy Kamala's political instincts?\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, she botched a softball sit-down with a friendly podcaster who asked her for her hottest hot take.\n\nHarris's answer to this observant Muslim host: bacon should be used as a 'spice' on everything.\n\nThe buried interview has now resurfaced. Kamala's career has not.\n\nBad double date\n\nThis week Prince and Princess of Wales hosted French President Emanuel Macron and his prize-fighting wife for a state visit.\n\nRoyal watchers were pleased to see the affectionate hometown pair so cozy, as William gently helped his wife down the stairs.\n\nEmanuel was just lucky he didn't get hit again.\n\nValley girl\n\nThe hills were out in Sun Valley as Lauren Sanchez and her trophy husband strolled through the billionaire summer camp with her Rocky Mountains on display. Girl, you got the guy, give the cleavage a rest.\n\nJazzy Jeff squeak out a million for better fitting tops.\n\nSpare a quid?\n\nBarack Obama may be worth a handsome $70 million, but he's still grinding.\n\nBarry is hawking photo-ops and hand shakes at a pair of September speaking gigs in the UK for a cool 1750 pounds a pop.\n\nHe should donate the proceeds to the upkeep of his $1 billion presidential library.\n\nNah… let the taxpayer cover it.\n\nKate Moss looked beat up from the feet up at a recent beach outing.\n\nThe once gorgeous supermodel appears to have skipped the dentist by the look of her corn-tooth smile. Is she playing ex-Johnny Depp in a new biopic?\n\nGen-Z Milli Vanilli\n\nA rediscovered 60s band is smashing it on Spotify.\n\nThe Velvet Sundown has amassed over a million monthly listeners, but it turns out they're as fake as the affection between the First Couple of France.\n\nThis soulless hoax is an AI creation!\n\nWell, they're perfect for a generation raised on iPhones and isolation.","summary":"The knives came out for the QB with the most Superbowl hardware in history - and Sofia lovers called him ageist, misogynist scum.

There would have been no Trump campaign of vengeance to rouse the MAGA faithful and desensitize the public to his failings,\" Kilgore wrote in New York Magazine's Intelligencer. Kilgore acknowledged in the column that the idea seemed nuts, noting that Trump would have inherited several burdens had he remained in office. He wrote that everyone would agree that it would have been good if there were no Jan. 6 capitol riot. \"The effect of this scenario on the Democrats of 2024 would have been even more dramatic. A defeated Joe Biden would have gracefully ended his political career in 2021. Kamala Harris would have suffered two debilitating losses in the 2020 presidential cycle, once as a presidential nomination candidate and once as a veep nominee; no one would have considered her a serious candidate for 2024,\" he added. DEM SENATOR SAYS BIDEN SHOULD HAVE DROPPED OUT OF PRESIDENTIAL RACE MUCH SOONER Kilgore said the Democratic Party would have had a normal nominating process leading up to 2024 and that the party would have overcome its divisions between the progressive and establishment wings. A Trump win in 2020, according to Kilgore, would have allowed Democrats and the former president to avoid the key issues that prompted Americans to vote for Trump in 2024, including immigration, inflation and Biden's age. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE \"The Democratic Party would not be defending record inflation, uncontrolled immigration, too much ‘wokeness,’ a mismanaged withdrawal from Afghanistan, and all sorts of other problems. No one would be writing exposés about an aging Democratic president losing his grip but hanging grimly on to power. Democrats could have managed a fresh start and a likely 2024 win without losing ground with key constituencies or earning the bitter enmity of so many unhappy young people,\" he added. Kilgore said that the Democratic administration's alignment with several negative realities made Trump's political comeback possible. BETO O'ROURKE CLAIMS BIDEN 'FAILED' AMERICA BY RUNNING FOR SECOND TERM The political columnist argued that Trump's comeback led to \"horrific policies\" and a GOP that is \"devoted to hatefulness and extremism.\" He also said that it also left the Democratic Party in shambles, as they lack a clear path forward.

Now that his “One Big Beautiful Bill” is the law of the land, the American people have reason to once again be hopeful for a better future for themselves, their families and their beloved country.\n\nIt takes time to dig out from a failed presidency, when reckless decisions were made for four long years without regard for the damage they would cause. Since taking office in January, Trump and his team have been working to change America’s trajectory.\n\nThe border is now more secure than it’s ever been. The Iranian nuclear threat has been eliminated. The mindset of fiscal responsibility is permeating throughout the federal government. Criminal illegal aliens are being deported. The Pentagon is once again focused on defending America instead of wokeism. Fair trade deals are being negotiated that level the playing field for American workers, and our country is once again respected around the world.\n\nThe enactment of Trump’s policy agenda puts an exclamation point on a successful first six months back in the Oval Office. The consequential bill says loud and clear that Trump and Republicans in Congress are listening to the American people. The legislation extends the pro-growth Trump tax cuts for years to come; provides a record cut in mandatory federal spending that starts to address the national debt crisis; prioritizes Medicaid for those who need it most by implementing work requirements; fully secures the border and funds the largest deportation operation in American history; ends taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security; green lights American energy production to drive down inflation; and dramatically strengthens our national defense with a Golden Dome.\n\nMake no mistake about it, this is an enormous win for Trump, the GOP, and hardworking American families who have been waiting for relief—and common sense—from Washington for far too long. The Joe Biden-Kamala Harris administration was a time of volatility, uncertainty, lawlessness, and malaise. Trump’s signature legislation will finally calm the stormy seas caused by the destructive policies of Biden and the left-wing radicals he delegated authority to.\n\nIt’s fitting to think about what dangerous priorities would have been included in Harris’ first budget reconciliation bill had she been elected last November. By listening to Democrat leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and watching their caucuses vote against the One Big Beautiful Bill en bloc, we can assume that the Harris-Tim Walz administration would have not only allowed the Trump tax cuts to expire but would have also called for additional tax increases to bankroll their socialist wish list. The rhetoric coming from the left also makes it clear that the border would still be wide open, and blanket amnesty for illegal immigrants—including criminals—would probably have been a part of the legislation as well. And it goes without saying that the Green New Scam would have been supercharged, inflation would have gone unaddressed, and the corrosive diversity, equity, and inclusion agenda would have been codified.\n\nElections do indeed have consequences. And Trump’s landslide victory spared America from a left-wing agenda that our country may not have been able to recover from.\n\nIn the last few days alone, we’ve seen yet another month of robust job creation. The Supreme Court ruled to stop the unconstitutional practice of nationwide injunctions by partisan district court judges. The Barack Obama administration was exposed for politicizing the 2016 intelligence assessment to frame Trump with the phony Russia hoax. A new fair trade deal with Vietnam was announced, and the stock market is at record levels.\n\nBut due to our nation’s dire financial situation, the president and House Speaker Mike Johnson know there must be more tax reform and additional spending cuts in the form of new reconciliation bills later this year and next spring. After a long period of darkness, these are encouraging times for the United States of America. Come July 13, remember what may have been and say a prayer for Trump.\n\nOriginally published by The Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

In an interview, Biden admits it was a “mistake” to talk about putting Trump in “the bullseye” days before the assassination attempt.\n\nTuesday, July 16 – The FBI warns of more potential violence in the wake of Trump’s shooting. Intelligence claims Iran had a separate plot to assassinate Trump, but there is no proven link to Crooks. Biden returns to the campaign trail for the first time since the assassination attempt and insists he isn’t stepping down.\n\nWednesday, July 17 – Joe Biden tests positive for Covid, just days after saying he would drop out of the presidential race if he was diagnosed with a medical condition. It intensifies the calls for him to step aside with Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom floated as potential replacements. At the RNC, JD Vance makes his first speech since being selected as Trump’s VP pick, to the delight of the MAGA crowd.\n\nThursday, July 18 – Donald Trump addresses the RNC, his first speech since surviving an attempted assassination. He appears slower and more subdued than usual but gives the longest convention acceptance speech in US history. Just before he goes on, former wrestler Hulk Hogan rips his shirt off and tells cheering crowds “Trumpomania” will sweep America. Former First Lady Melania, who has barely been seen on the campaign trail, makes an appearance but does not speak. Barack Obama joins calls for Biden to step aside.\n\nFriday, July 19 – President Biden appears to consider resigning, as a source says he is in a “contemplative stage” while isolating with Covid. Video emerges showing Biden appearing to lean into the wrong woman after mistaking her for his wife Jill. Meanwhile, the world’s biggest tech outage sparks travel chaos for Republicans leaving the RNC in Milwaukee.\n\nSaturday, July 20 – Donald Trump holds his first campaign rally since the shooting in Butler. He appears in Michigan without his ear bandage. His former doctor Ronny Jackson describes his injuries. He appears in his first interview alongside his running mate Vance. Senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi speaks for the first time since being linked to growing calls for Biden to resign. Meanwhile, Biden’s reelection campaign continues to insist he is running, as a spokesperson slams Trump’s rally remarks as showing he is “focused only on himself.”\n\nSunday, July 21 – Joe Biden announces he isn’t running in November in a shock letter, just hours after insisting he was staying in the race. He is the first incumbent to step down in their first term since 1968. Biden endorses Kamala Harris for president as senior Dems through their support behind the Vice President. The news appears to throw the Republicans off their stride. Biden vows to continue his term until November’s election.\n\nMonday, July 22 – Kamala Harris raises a record $81 million in 24 hours as she secures the Democratic candidacy. She also inherits some $91 million in leftover campaign funds from Biden. Harris gives her first speech since Biden stepped out, and speaks to the president on the phone, although he doesn’t appear in person. Under-pressure Secret Service chief Kimberly Cheatle appears on Capitol Hill and faces increasing calls to resign over the shooting of Trump. She admits the Secret Service “failed” on July 13 and resigns the following day.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA local mayor who was seated in the front row during the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: I Had a Near-Death Experience at Trump Rally: Shielding My Pregnant Wife During Gunfire at the President first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/i-had-a-near-death-experience-at-trump-rally-shielding-my-pregnant-wife-during-gunfire-at-the-president/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/I-was-inches-from-death-as-Trump-rally-gunman-shot.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-13 14:27:41","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.36},{"id":341400458,"title":"Another Moderate Republican Opts Out","text":"The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture.

Now the argument goes national. From the Central Valley of California to Midwestern battlegrounds and suburban districts of the northeast, the new law already is shaping the 2026 midterm battle for control of the House of Representatives. The outcome will set the tone for Trump's final two years in the Oval Office. Also Read | Is FBI Director Kash Patel Resigning Amid Dan Bongino vs Pam Bondi Row? Republican Leader Fact-Checks Fake News, Says 'Conspiracy Theories Just Aren't True, Never Have Been'. Democrats need a net gain of three House seats to break the GOP's chokehold on Washington and reestablish a power centre to counter Trump. There's added pressure to flip the House given that midterm Senate contests are concentrated in Republican-leaning states, making it harder for Democrats to reclaim that chamber. As Republicans see it, they've now delivered broad tax cuts, an unprecedented investment in immigration enforcement and new restraints on social safety net programmes.

Democrats see a law that rolls back health insurance access and raises costs for middle-class Americans while cutting taxes mostly for the rich, curtailing green energy initiatives and restricting some workers' organising rights. “It represents the broken promise they made to the American people,” said Rep Suzan DelBene, a Washington Democrat who chairs the party's House campaign arm. “We're going to continue to hold Republicans accountable for this vote.” Parties gear up for a fight Whether voters see it that way will be determined on a district-by-district level, but the battle will be more intense in some places than others. Among the 435 House districts, only 69 contests were decided by less than 10 percentage points in the 2024 general election. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has so far identified 26 Democratic-held seats it must defend vigorously, along with 34 GOP-held seats it believes could be ripe to flip. Republicans' campaign arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee, has so far listed 18 GOP incumbents as priorities, plus two districts opened by retirements. There are a historically low number of so-called crossover districts: Only 13 Democrats represent districts Trump carried in 2024, while just three Republicans serve districts Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris carried. Both committees are busy recruiting challengers and open-seat candidates and more retirements could come, so the competitive map will evolve. Still, there are clusters of districts guaranteed to influence the national result. California, despite its clear lean to Democrats statewide, has at least nine House districts expected to be up for grabs: three in the Central Valley and six in southern California. Six are held by Democrats, three by the GOP. Pennsylvania features four districts that have been among the closest national House races for several consecutive cycles. They include a suburban Philadelphia seat represented by Rep Brian Fitzpatrick, one of just two House Republicans to vote against Trump's bill and one of the three GOP lawmakers from a district Harris won. Fitzpatrick cited the Medicaid cuts. Vice President JD Vance plans on Wednesday to be in Republican Rep Rob Bresnahan's northwest Pennsylvania district to tout the GOP package. Bresnahan's seat is a top Democratic target. Iowa and Wisconsin, meanwhile, feature four contiguous GOP-held districts in farm-heavy regions where voters could be swayed by fallout from Trump's tariffs. Democrats fight to define the GOP Beyond bumper-sticker labels – Trump's preferred “Big Beautiful Bill” versus Democrats' “Big Ugly Bill” retort – the 900-page law is, in fact, an array of policies with varying impact. Democrats hammer Medicaid and food assistance cuts, some timed to take full effect only after the 2026 midterms, along with Republicans' refusal to extend tax credits to some people who obtained health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law; 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits. “Folks will die here in Louisiana and in other parts of the country,” House Minority Leader Jeffries warned last week during a town hall in Republican Speaker Mike Johnson's home state of Louisiana. Jeffries singled out vulnerable Republicans like California Rep David Valadao, who represents a heavily agricultural Central Valley district where more than half the population is eligible for the joint state-federal insurance programme. California allows immigrants with legal status and those who are undocumented to qualify for Medicaid, so not all Medicaid recipients are voters. But the programme helps finance the overall health care system, including nursing homes and hospitals. Republicans highlight the law's tightened work requirements for Medicaid enrollees. They argue it's a popular provision that will strengthen the programme. “I voted for this bill because it does preserve the Medicaid programme for its intended recipients — children, pregnant women, the disabled, and elderly,” Valadao said. “I know how important the programme is for my constituents.” Republicans hope voters 'see lower taxes' The law includes USD 4.5 trillion in tax cuts. It makes permanent existing rates and brackets approved during Trump's first term. Republicans and their allies have hammered vulnerable Democrats for “raising costs” on American households by opposing the bill. GOP campaign aides point to the popularity of individual provisions: boosting the USD 2,000 child tax credit to USD 2,200 (some families at lower income levels would not get the full credit), new deductions on tip and overtime income and auto loans; and a new deduction for older adults earning less than USD 75,000 a year. “Everyone will have more take home pay. They'll have more jobs and opportunity,” Johnson said in a Fox News Sunday interview. “The economy will be doing better and we'll be able to point to that as the obvious result of what we did.” Democrats note that the biggest beneficiaries of Trump's tax code are wealthy Americans and corporations. Pairing that with safety net cuts, Florida Rep Debbie Wasserman Schultz concluded, “The cruelty is the point.” Immigration, meanwhile, was Trump's strongest issue in 2024. NRCC aides say that will continue with the new law's investments in immigration enforcement. Democrats believe the Trump administration has overplayed its hand with its push for mass deportation. Playing the Trump card The president is a titanic variable. Democrats point to 2018, when they notched a 40-seat net gain in House seats to take control away from the GOP. This year, Democrats have enjoyed a double-digit swing in special elections around the country when compared to 2024 presidential results. Similar trends emerged in 2017 after Trump's 2016 victory. Democrats say that reflects voter discontent with Trump once he's actually in charge. Republicans answer that Trump's job approval remains higher at this point than in 2017. But the GOP's effort is further complicated by ongoing realignments: Since Trump's emergence, Democrats have gained affluent white voters -– like those in suburban swing districts -– while Trump has drawn more working-class voters across racial and ethnic groups. But Republicans face a stiffer challenge of replicating Trump's coalition in a midterm election without him on the ballot. Democrats, meanwhile, must corral voters who are not a threat to vote for Republicans but could stay home. Jeffries said he's determined not to let that happen. “We're going to do everything we can until we end this national nightmare.” (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

I hope. Famous last words,\" he quipped, drawing laughs and cheers.\n\n“You always have to think positive,\" he went on. \"I didn’t like that sound, either.\"\n\nThe comments, just days before the first anniversary of Trump's near-assassination in Butler, Pennsylvania, served as a stark reminder of the lingering impact of the day when a gunman opened fire at a campaign rally, grazing Trump's ear and killing one of his supporters in the crowd.\n\nThe attack dramatically upended the 2024 campaign and launched a frenzied 10-day stretch that included Mr. Trump's triumphant arrival at the Republican National Convention with a bandaged ear, President Joe Biden's decision to abandon his reelection bid and the elevation of Vice-President Kamala Harris as his successor.\n\nOne year after coming millimetres from a very different outcome, Mr. Trump, according to friends and aides, is still the same Trump. But they see signs, beyond being on higher alert on stage, that his brush with death did change him in some ways: He is more attentive and more grateful, they say, and speaks openly about how he believes he was saved by God to save the country and serve a second term, making him even more dug in on achieving his far-reaching agenda.\n\n“I think it’s always in the back of his mind,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a longtime friend and ally who was in close touch with Mr. Trump after the shooting and joined him that night in New Jersey after he was treated at a Pennsylvania hospital. “He’s still a rough and tumble guy, you know. He hasn’t become a Zen Buddhist. But I think he is, I’ll say this, more appreciative. He’s more attentive to his friends,\" he said, pointing to Mr. Trump sending him a message on his birthday earlier this week.\n\nMs. Graham added: \"It’s just a miracle he’s not dead. He definitely was a man who believed he had a second lease on life.\"\n\nWhile many who survive traumatic events try to block them from memory, Mr. Trump has instead surrounded himself with memorabilia commemorating one of the darkest episodes in modern political history. He's decorated the White House and his golf clubs with art pieces depicting the moment after the shooting when he stood up, thrust his fist dramatically in the air and chanted, “Fight, fight, fight!\" \n\nA painting of the scene now hangs prominently in the foyer of the White House State Floor near the staircase to the president’s residence. Earlier this year, he began displaying a bronze sculpture of the tableau in the Oval Office on a side table next to the Resolute Desk. \n\nAnd while he said in his speech at the Republican convention that he would only talk about what had happened once, he often shares the story of how he turned his head at just the right moment to show off his “all-time favorite chart in history” of southern border crossings that he credits for saving his life. \n\nDuring a press conference in the White House briefing room last month, he acknowledged lingering physical effects from the shooting.\n\n“I get that throbbing feeling every once in a while,\" he said, gesturing to his ear. “But you know what, that’s OK. This is a dangerous business. What I do is a dangerous business.”\n\nMr. Trump will spend Sunday's anniversary attending the FIFA Club World Cup soccer final in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nMr. Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles, who as his then-campaign chief was with him at the rally, said in a podcast interview released last week that Trump walked away from the shooting believing he had been spared for a reason.\n\n“I would say I think he believes that he was saved. I do. And he would never — even if he thought it before, I don’t think he would have admitted it. And he will now,\" she told “Pod Force One.” \n\nShe, too credited divine intervention. The chart, she noted, “was always the last chart in the rotation. And it was always on the other side. So to have him ask for that chart eight minutes in, and to have it come on the side that is opposite, caused him to look in a different direction and lift his head just a little because it was higher. And that just doesn’t happen because it happened. It happened because, I believe, God wanted him to live.”\n\nAs a result, she said, when Trump says things that “are perfunctory — every president says ‘God bless America’ — well, it’s more profound with him now, and it’s more personal.\"\n\nShe also credited the attack with helping change public perceptions of Trump during the campaign.\n\n“For the American public to see a person who was such a fighter as he was that day, I think, as awful and tragic as it might have been, it turned out to be something that showed people his character. And that’s helpful,\" she said.\n\n“You know, I have an obligation to do a good job, I feel, because I was really saved,” Trump told Fox News Friday. “I owe a lot. And I think — I hope — the reason I was saved was to save our country.” \n\nRoger Stone, a longtime friend and informal adviser, noted that Trump has had other brushes with death, including a last-minute decision not to board a helicopter to Atlantic City that crashed in 1989 and another near-assassination two months after Butler when U.S. Secret Service agents spotted a man pointing a rifle through the fence near where Trump was golfing.\n\nStone said he's found the president “to be more serene and more determined after the attempt on his life” in Butler.\n\n“He told me directly that he believed he was spared by God for the purpose of restoring the nation to greatness, and that he believes deeply that he is protected now by the Lord,” he said. \n\nRalph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, agreed.\n\n“I think for people who know the president, it is commonly believed that it changed him. I mean, how could it not? Imagine if you were who he was and if you don’t turn your head at that instant,\" he said. “He knew he was lucky to be alive.”\n\nGiven how close Mr. Trump came to a very different outcome, Reed said, “it’s hard not to feel on some level that the hand of providence protected him for some greater purpose. And there are people that I’ve talked to who said they were confident that he would win for that reason. That there must have been a reason.”","summary":"One year after Donald Trump’s near-assassination at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, friends and allies see some signs of a changed man","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a-year-after-trumps-near-assassination-friends-and-allies-see-some-signs-of-a-changed-man/article69807642.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/lstrq/article69807680.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_New_Trump_after_assa_2_1_5SD4KQBL.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-13 13:46:46","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.096},{"id":341167446,"title":"Sorry, Elon. There’s already a third party, and it’s called MAGA","text":"AgenciesMusk is a political contradiction, with no consistent ideas about policy. \n\nElon Musk just can’t seem to make up his mind. Either he has “done enough” when it comes to political spending and will focus on his businesses or he will spend more money to start a new political party to take on the “uniparty.”“By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it!” Musk wrote on X after posting a poll on July 4. The world’s richest man is right. For years, Americans have stated a desire for another party beyond red or blue. An October Gallup poll showed support for a third party at 58%. The numbers speak to an overall discontent with a lack of choice and distaste for rank partisanship. Third-party support ebbs and flows, but the desire for more choices is a constant.Nevertheless, while voters claim to want more choices, once they cast their ballots, third-party candidates haven’t broken through in any meaningful way. In 2020, 1.79% voted for a third-party candidate for the White House. In 2024, 1.85% of voters backed a candidate not named Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. A group called No Labels tried and failed to identify a credible White House candidate in 2024. Typically, third party candidates have only acted as spoilers; see Ross Perot in 1992, Ralph Nader in 2000 and Jill Stein in 2016. Part of the problem is the very high structural hurdles the two existing parties have put in place to keep rival parties from forming. Live EventsBloombergThere is also this to consider: A third party kind of already exists. It’s called the Republican Party under Trump, otherwise known as MAGA. Rather than run on a third party line, as he explored doing in 2000 with Perot’s Reform Party, Trump rode populist discontent to power within an existing political party.He hijacked the GOP and remade it in his own image with ideas from both parties. He is pro-union, more isolationist than hawk, and against free trade. And he doesn’t care about the debt and deficits — he agrees with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren that the debt ceiling “should be thrown out entirely.” As one headline from Reason Magazine put it, “Donald Trump Sounds Like a Democrat From the 1980s.”Musk, with his billions and his influence, might be better off bankrolling candidates within the two-party system who offer a similar ideological blend. But for now, he seems set on doing what others before him have tried and failed to do. So let’s take him at his word and assume that the world’s richest man will show some focus and play in the 2026 midterms via a third party. “One way to execute on this would be to laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts,” he posted. “Given the razor-thin legislative margins, that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring that they serve the true will of the people.”His strategy actually isn’t a bad one and aligns with what some other groups are doing.“Elon, I don’t know what he is going to do, but I believe some of these candidates he would want to give some cash to,” said Adam Brandon, senior advisor to The Independent Center, a group that will back a handful of independent candidates in the midterms. “If we do this in 2026, this sets up a different conversation in 2028.” The group is hosting what they are billing as the largest independent event in Washington DC later this month, and predicts that 2026 will see an independent surge. But Musk may be a tainted messenger. He once enjoyed a level of support among a wide array of people with differing political views as a kind of real life Tony Stark, but his approval ratings have dipped in recent months, as has his brand. In December, according to a YouGov poll, Musk was even among independent voters, with 42% liking and disliking him. His unfavorable rating is now 59% among that group. His numbers are also down among Democrats and Republicans. It’s true that some people tend to like Musk’s products, even as they dislike him. Witness the Anti-Elon Tesla Club stickers affixed to his signature product. What is missing, however, is a real reason for Musk’s latest version of the disruptive third party. Musk is a political contradiction, with no consistent ideas about policy. He says the America Party is about freedom, yet it seems to be about his own personal grievances with Trump. He claims to care about ballooning deficits, yet is happy to take billions from the federal government to foot the bill for his projects. He claims to care about the environment, yet also claims that global depopulation is a bigger threat than climate change.What would the America Party platform look like and what candidates would it attract? What story would they tell about the big problems the country faces and what would the solutions be? That kind of narrative coherence is necessary, as party affiliation has become an extension of identity. In choosing to back a party, voters are telling a story about who they are, what they believe and how they think the government should operate. It’s akin to joining a club.Musk has billions. But he has few resonant answers to that standard question that can be paraphrased this way when it comes to political parties: What are you and why are you here? Absent that, his third-party ambitions are likely to run aground.

Now the argument goes national. From the Central Valley of California to Midwestern battlegrounds and suburban districts of the northeast, the new law already is shaping the 2026 midterm battle for control of the House of Representatives. The outcome will set the tone for Trump's final two years in the Oval Office. Democrats need a net gain of three House seats to break the GOP's chokehold on Washington and reestablish a power center to counter Trump. There's added pressure to flip the House given that midterm Senate contests are concentrated in Republican-leaning states, making it harder for Democrats to reclaim that chamber. As Republicans see it, they've now delivered broad tax cuts, an unprecedented investment in immigration enforcement and new restraints on social safety net programs. Democrats see a law that rolls back health insurance access and raises costs for middle-class Americans while cutting taxes mostly for the rich, curtailing green energy initiatives and restricting some workers' organizing rights. \"It represents the broken promise they made to the American people,\" said Rep. Suzan DelBene, a Washington Democrat who chairs the party's House campaign arm. \"We're going to continue to hold Republicans accountable for this vote.\"Live Events Parties gear up for a fight Whether voters see it that way will be determined on a district-by-district level, but the battle will be more intense in some places than others. Among the 435 House districts, only 69 contests were decided by less than 10 percentage points in the 2024 general election. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has so far identified 26 Democratic-held seats it must defend vigorously, along with 34 GOP-held seats it believes could be ripe to flip. Republicans' campaign arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee, has so far listed 18 GOP incumbents as priorities, plus two districts opened by retirements. There are a historically low number of so-called crossover districts: Only 13 Democrats represent districts Trump carried in 2024, while just three Republicans serve districts Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris carried. Both committees are busy recruiting challengers and open-seat candidates and more retirements could come, so the competitive map will evolve. Still, there are clusters of districts guaranteed to influence the national result. California, despite its clear lean to Democrats statewide, has at least nine House districts expected to be up for grabs: three in the Central Valley and six in southern California. Six are held by Democrats, three by the GOP. Pennsylvania features four districts that have been among the closest national House races for several consecutive cycles. They include a suburban Philadelphia seat represented by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, one of just two House Republicans to vote against Trump's bill and one of the three GOP lawmakers from a district Harris won. Fitzpatrick cited the Medicaid cuts. Vice President JD Vance plans on Wednesday to be in Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan's northwest Pennsylvania district to tout the GOP package. Bresnahan's seat is a top Democratic target. Iowa and Wisconsin, meanwhile, feature four contiguous GOP-held districts in farm-heavy regions where voters could be swayed by fallout from Trump's tariffs. Democrats fight to define the GOP Beyond bumper-sticker labels - Trump's preferred \"Big Beautiful Bill\" versus Democrats' \"Big Ugly Bill\" retort - the 900-page law is, in fact, an array of policies with varying impact. Democrats hammer Medicaid and food assistance cuts, some timed to take full effect only after the 2026 midterms, along with Republicans' refusal to extend tax credits to some people who obtained health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law; 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits. \"Folks will die here in Louisiana and in other parts of the country,\" House Minority Leader Jeffries warned last week during a town hall in Republican Speaker Mike Johnson's home state of Louisiana. Jeffries singled out vulnerable Republicans like California Rep. David Valadao, who represents a heavily agricultural Central Valley district where more than half the population is eligible for the joint state-federal insurance program. California allows immigrants with legal status and those who are undocumented to qualify for Medicaid, so not all Medicaid recipients are voters. But the program helps finance the overall health care system, including nursing homes and hospitals. Republicans highlight the law's tightened work requirements for Medicaid enrollees. They argue it's a popular provision that will strengthen the program. \"I voted for this bill because it does preserve the Medicaid program for its intended recipients - children, pregnant women, the disabled, and elderly,\" Valadao said. \"I know how important the program is for my constituents.\" Republicans hope voter s see lower taxes The law includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. It makes permanent existing rates and brackets approved during Trump's first term. Republicans and their allies have hammered vulnerable Democrats for \"raising costs\" on American households by opposing the bill. GOP campaign aides point to the popularity of individual provisions: boosting the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200 (some families at lower income levels would not get the full credit), new deductions on tip and overtime income and auto loans; and a new deduction for older adults earning less than $75,000 a year. \"Everyone will have more take home pay. They'll have more jobs and opportunity,\" Johnson said in a Fox News Sunday interview. \"The economy will be doing better and we'll be able to point to that as the obvious result of what we did.\" Democrats note that the biggest beneficiaries of Trump's tax code are wealthy Americans and corporations. Pairing that with safety net cuts, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz concluded, \"The cruelty is the point.\" Immigration, meanwhile, was Trump's strongest issue in 2024. NRCC aides say that will continue with the new law's investments in immigration enforcement. Democrats believe the Trump administration has overplayed its hand with its push for mass deportation. Playing the Trump card The president is a titanic variable. Democrats point to 2018, when they notched a 40-seat net gain in House seats to take control away from the GOP. This year, Democrats have enjoyed a double-digit swing in special elections around the country when compared to 2024 presidential results. Similar trends emerged in 2017 after Trump's 2016 victory. Democrats say that reflects voter discontent with Trump once he's actually in charge. Republicans answer that Trump's job approval remains higher at this point than in 2017. But the GOP's effort is further complicated by ongoing realignments: Since Trump's emergence, Democrats have gained affluent white voters -- like those in suburban swing districts -- while Trump has drawn more working-class voters across racial and ethnic groups. But Republicans face a stiffer challenge of replicating Trump's coalition in a midterm election without him on the ballot. Democrats, meanwhile, must corral voters who are not a threat to vote for Republicans but could stay home. Jeffries said he's determined not to let that happen. \"We're going to do everything we can until we end this national nightmare.\"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News ontrumpDemocratsRepublicanAmericansUS GOP\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

He bought 50 rounds of ammo, and then found a parking spot less than a mile from the rally and began to walk towards the farm show complex.\n\nA local Pittsburgh television caught him on film walking back and forth at the perimeter of the event just over an hour before he fired his first shots.\n\nHe was spotted minutes before the shooting on top of the roof of an out building—rally attendees spotted him and desperately tried to alert the Secret Service while a Butler Township officer attempted to stop him when he himself climbed the same roof as Crooks who pointed his gun directly at the officer.\n\nThe officer retreated. Crooks began firing at the crowd and at then former President Donald Trump, who as fate would have it, had turned his head to face a chart; a chart that was rarely used, and if it was used, it was on his other side and towards the end of a rally.\n\nCrooks would hit the President in the ear, mortally wound local retired fire chief Corey Comperatore, a father of two daughters, and wife of Helen, and gravely injured two others in the crowd: Jim Copenhaver and David Dutch. \n\n26 seconds later, after firing those shots, Crooks was dead, shot in the head by a Secret Service sniper. Trump, meanwhile, was able to gather himself and rise to his feet, pumping his fist and chanting “fight, fight” with blood streaming down his face. The incident and iconic images all but sealed his return to the presidency, regardless of whether he was set to face former President Joe Biden or his eventual opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, in November.\n\nOne year later, walking around the grounds of the Butler Farm Show grounds, little has changed, although the stage which Trump spoke on is now a building.\n\nLittle is still known about Crooks and his motives, although a CBS News investigation published this week showed his descent into secrecy began in the fall of 2023 when he started using Mailfence, which is an encrypted email service, and Mullvad, a VPN service that effectively makes online activity covert.\n\nIt also showed that he was interested in things fairly common for a 20-year-old in western Pennsylvania, such as news updates on the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Task Force on the Trump Assassination Attempt, Crooks’s father said in hindsight that the signs of his son’s mental health decay began six months before July 13, 2024.\n\nAn investigator wrote: “Crooks’ father explained that within the last year he observed several instances of his son dancing in his bedroom throughout the night. He would occasionally see Crooks talking to himself with his hands moving, which he expressed as uncommon and had become more prevalent after he had finished his last semester.”\n\nIn the Bethel Park neighborhood where Crooks’ mother and father live, and where he was raised, the home has multiple security cameras but very little signs of life despite numerous visits to the neighborhood. \n\nThey have a lawyer, and neither is answering questions.\n\nBoth parents allowed their social work licenses to expire a couple of months ago; his mother, Mary, submitted her resignation from her lifelong job in February. It is clear she left because of the shooting.\n\n“Certain circumstances have left me with no other option than to vacate a position I have been proud to hold for the past 27 years,” she wrote in the resignation letter originally obtained by the New York Times.\n\nHelen Comperatore says she remains stuck in that moment when her husband, Corey, her childhood sweetheart, was taken from her. They met in kindergarten, dated in high school, and were married at 21. Within weeks, one of her daughters will be getting married.\n\nToday, she will be holding a private memorial service for Corey. \n\n“Corey should be here,” she told the Washington Examiner through tears while sitting at a picnic bench not far from her Sarver home.\n\n Of Crooks, that day, and the failings of the Secret Service haunt her.\n\n“They failed my husband miserably, and I want answers from this,” she said.\n\nOne year later, several agents have been suspended, a decision announced this week, but she wants more information. In talking with the people of Butler, people who attended the rally and the suburban neighborhood of Bethel Park, that sentiment is shared.\n\nOn Trump, she says she knows he will make sure that things that went wrong that day won’t happen again.\n\n“I still worry about him because of this, he is the most compassionate man I’ve met, but one year later I still worry about him every day.”","summary":"One year ago, then former President Donald Trump was shot during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.
